 if you really like dancing with him, do not apologize for saying what you mean. It's not like he has a girlfriend or something, that you are overstepping.  you're just having anxiety.

But another psychologist may choose to list all diagnoses separately, but in my opinion and experience , they should explain which ones are caused as a result of which other ones. A bad psychologist would diagnose them all separately and not acknowledge that any of them interact. This was my experience with so-called ""neuropsychologists"" and therefore I don't recommend them.

Don't look at it as something wrong with your brain.

But if not considering co-occuring conditions, then I guess it depends on what your idea is of ""severely"".

**TL;DR You are making grandiose assumptions about my childhood. You are judging my life history solely based on what I already typed to you, and based on what is normal to you as an outsider, which is exactly what the last professional did to me.**

First, I had narcissistic parents who believed in never taking me to doctors, unless it was for an infection that would not heal on its own. my dad thinks he is a doctor and he is the definitive person to go to when anyone on his side of the family has a medical issue (but he has no knowledge). My parents never even believed in going to doctors for themselves.coming from this, I'm not even going to say anything about them and mental health other than they have their own mental health issues, and I do not think they are capable of understanding at this point anyway. So I have dedicated the last 5 years of my life trying to be the opposite of them and catch up on medical things and learn how to take care of myself. My entire life now is centered around this, but it is a great struggle.

Since childhood I have always sensed I was different from everybody else but could never articulate how or why. My entire life I had these problems. I did learn to compensate for some things on my own. But I've always known that I had these problems when nobody else seemed to.

**Since childhood I never could live alone and have always had to have support in my living environment.** You can imagine that would be hard with a narcissistic parent, but my mom was less narcissistic and did come to take care of my on a regular basis when I did try to live alone. However, **I only tried to live alone from the intense pressure of them.  I was absolutely clueless about how to take care of myself, let alone be able to take care of an apartment or be able to tolerate the environment outside of an apartment.**  At 18, they threatened to kick me out of the house because they wanted nothing to do with me ( definitely not because they thought I could take care of myself ) . **They told me ""you go to college or we never want to see you again"".** They even told me which degree with no other choice.

I have always thought that they never wanted a kid to begin with, but they would never admit that because it would look bad on them.

>seclusion and isolation in a mental institution or at home

**I HAVE been secluded and isolated my whole life, both because of mental health (depression, anxiety, and autism) and because I grew up in a very rural area and was never identified anywhere else.** I never had any siblings to tell me what's a normal home life.

I was always the very quiet kid. I would have been diagnosed with selective mutism if I would have seen a professional with knowledge, but narcissistic parents say things like ""oh he's just shy"".

One of the things I did learn to compensate at was in a school environment.  I liked the structure in school, but had to learn everything twice on my own at home. It took me the whole night to do homework, starting from 3rd grade.

I think Teachers never saw a problem with me because of lack of knowledge of autism themselves, because I did learn to compensate by learning on my own in my own way but they never knew that,  and because I was always the kid that behaved and they were too distracted with the ones who didn't.

I thought all of this was still ""within normal"" until I was about 25, when I was forced to quit my job due to the problems I already mentioned and had to move back home with them. I did not even identify my parents as being abnormal or abusive until then.

>the degrees in an assessment are related to what kind of support you may need to function in life, and not what you feel about it. When these labels are assigned, early in life, they help a lot to find strategies at the early intervention stage.

But my feelings are based on facts. **I have had a therapist and occasional help from case management for years and it's not adequate. I had to move back home when I was past my breaking point and could continue to try to live alone. I am very certain that if I had case management more frequently, with the right person,  or something like case management on a daily basis, that I would be much better off. I know part of this is due to comorbidity with everything else and not just autism.**

>Finally, as anyone in life each needs to 'get on with it' whether is autism, or any other personal difficulty. It is not easy, but you can't say at 30 that not having a diagnosis was the cause of your failures. You simply don't know...

You are right that I am bitter with my past and parents not taking care of me and upset because of the recent person not understanding me and with time my feelings will (very) gradually reduce.

**Looking back, I feel like I am finally at the point of what everyone else describes as turning 18, finally , and trying my hardest to deal with everything. I have tried to "" get on with it"" as you say for about 5 years now and I guess I have made progress (which is hard to think because of depression) , but the goal of integrating into society and living independently basically has not worked.**

I do not intend to say this was solely due to autism.

>Being autistic doesn't correlate to not having a fulfilling life.

Along with depression it does, from my experience.

>That putting a pin for the cause to that, it seems exaggerated and unfair for the rest of the autist out there.

I do not mean to lessen other with autism that have severe cognitive problems, etc. I actually prefer saying ""asperger's syndrome with hypersensitivity"" because

* it is more specific
* people have less assumptions about it in society
* My hypersensitivity to light and sound is a daily thing I have to work around because everybody else is likes things loud and bright, which historically happens more frequently than communication problems because I can just choose not to communicate. Although I hope to somehow get money for headphones as soon as possible because I only recently learned of noise cancelling headphones and that this is what I should have had as a kid, despite also having touch sensitivity to things on my head.

With a little more care and less assumptions that would have not happened. Due to my sleeping and self care problems, I got less sleep because I was trying to articulate everything in this reply. It causes the snowball effect with me.

If you do a search on reddit, you will see many posts about the term ""mild"" and how everybody does not like it, even professionals. It is not defined in the DSM nor anywhere else. Here is a good one in particular:

( I did the search after making this post)

I am going to make a joke about spicy autism. I do not have spicy autism because it is not defined anywhere and I do not eat any spicy foods  (at all). It is just as vague as mild autism. I feel like I am in taco bell now so I'll stop because it's too noisy."
autism,eu4zr54,t1_eu20116,1563466804.0,">I may be completely wrong here, but it sounds to me like you're intellectualizing something that causes you anxiety

You're not completely wrong. I have to study things in order to understand them and be comfortable with them ( typically). This is part of OCPD. I use it to understand the world and to compensate for being uncomfortable with something, due to autism. It is usually how I get over having anxiety with something.

But in the case of medication, I study what I can and the more I study the more it's making me more uncomfortable with it because the more alarming it is. Usually  that's a big red flag and I stop pursuing the thing, but in this case I keep feeling pressured by professionals who don't know me well enough yet, or the government, which is making me even more uncomfortable.

>about how he'd forgotten to take his vitamin D3 for three consecutive days, and how that had resulted in an unchecked downward spiral. And the way he came to terms with that, with the fact that we're all just bags of chemicals, and all it takes is a few milligrams of something to balance us out and make us functional, and how terrifying that shouldn't be, was strangely calming for me.

I can understand that, but I have had to take vitamin D supplements as well and have always been pretty comfortable with it, because:

* it is not the same as an anxiety /depression medication. it is a well studied thing in how it works.  It simply adds to the natural vitamin D which we know should be there.
* because it is naturally a part of the body, part of that is less side effects and less severe side effects compared to other types of medication, like for anxiety or depression
* It is prescribed differently. A doctor will measure vitamin D in the blood first to see exactly how much you're missing. ( The diagnosis based on data comes first. There is hardly any guesswork.) No doctor I know of can/ will measure brain chemicals and make any determination based on that. They are going in blind folded to a room and making a barely-educated guess on what will be the most helpful tools to bring, trying each of them until a positive change in the room.

> Yes, because time is linear and knowledge is incremental. How else would it work?

My point with that was that there is a very emotional component to doctors which I was completely oblivious to for a very long time. The logic as you said it is the easy part for me.

>Obviously we don't know everything, but that's no reason to pretend we know nothing. Neuroscience has improved in leaps and bounds. 

 Yeah, but  my point is I believe there is a threshold of knowledge /  understanding where I think safety is ensured and all  of the effects of a medication can be studied. And I think we are nowhere near that with present day. ( even though every doctor in the world disagrees with me) As I said, I am a very cautious person in general. I also believe in taking a natural remedy of some kind over a medication (if there is one).

I refer to my body as a fickle, very complex machine.

> Also your assumption that scientists will never unlock the secrets of consciousness or ""souls"" by studying chemicals is logically flawed as per your own previous example. 

I didn't mean ""never "" but I can see how what I wrote could be misinterpreted from what I intended to say, so I edited it. My point was that it make take a much longer time than anyone realizes. Maybe it is not chemical but more electrical or something else. ( I have read some but not a lot about this.) Maybe it will take us much longer to find and understand than we think. I don't know. I feel like every hypothesis I've heard in present day science is like throwing darts at a dart board with a blindfold, to unlock a door but we don't even know that the door exists or what's behind it. All we know is we think throwing darts is the first step and we're beginning to obtain darts and use them. But for instance, maybe we are damaging the room by throwing them. Maybe this is a not 100% accurate example, I just came up with it and I think it's helpful for others understanding me.

> What if your anxiety about taking anxiety medicine comes from... anxiety which could be managed by that very same medicine? 

 You're right of course, but I do have ( what I believe to be) some well justified reasons for being wary of it. There is both "" unjustified"" and ""justified"" anxiety. I try to make mine justified. a lot of times I think other people's lack of knowledge makes them oblivious to the real dangers of things. 

I forgot to say that 4 of my past friends ( and that's a high ratio because I have not had that many friends, so I am thinking about what that means...)  (all around my age  ) have taken medication for depression, anxiety, and / or ADHD, and they all told me negative, alarming experiences with it and stopped taking it, except for one who keeps taking it despite an alarming negative ongoing experience because  he said the benefit still outweighed the negative part for him. He had ADHD.

> Your call, but I wouldn't assume the doc was wrong just because they seemed to think they knew everything. They could be right AND arrogant lol 

Yeah, I realize that. I suppose as time goes on, I will get less upset over the actual incident and look at the facts more. I am very ""overloaded"" now as my therapist says.

The other big reasons were from depression, and anxiety which said person induced on me, and not being able to take care of myself in general, while living alone. Of all the things I did tell her,  I only wrote to her something like ""I was able to articulate most of the details of quitting my last job to the person who will be coming with me, so you can ask her about that if you want"". Previously, I just mentioned to her that I had to stop work due to not being able to work.

> It’s worth it to try to look around for someone who can let their ego go, learn from you and help you. 

She was actually the 2nd psychologist I had to diagnose me. Both diagnosed me with ASD, but the 2nd did additional tests on me, including verbal and nonverbal tests. The 1st person was also not perfect, but at least he didn't make ""grandiose"" claims. Ironically, ""off the record"", he said I was ""very autistic"", but the things he recommended for me to cope were things I was already doing.

> if you want to treat it without meds, it’s going to be a long, deliberate process and will take a lot of self awareness, examination and meditation 

 Yeah, I've been doing that for a few years now. Anxiety and depression are a part of my life and I know what to expect now. I did find something that almost completely alleviates anxiety,  living in wilderness, but I can't do it while I'm also trying to go to doctors or having to interact with society in other ways. It's frustrating that I finally found something that really helps but can't do it.

> Some people have trouble getting to the point where they have the ability to step outside of their anxiety to examine themselves and this is why meds are helpful, but you know yourself better than anyone. Meds aren’t for everyone, just know that it could be more laborious and she may not be the one with the skills to help you here. 

I wish professionals saw it like this, but they really don't. I feel an intense pressure by people who don't understand me or have no discussion with me prior to ""making the ruling"". They are not taking all of things into account, even if they were to come to the same conclusion in the end. If I try, I basically just stare at the bottle out of anxiety and never can take it. I explained why it gives me anxiety in the other long reply in this post.

> Keep in mind there’s no way for her to know your past discussions, research and experiences with meds if you haven’t laid it out for her.

Yeah, but there was no time to lay it out for her. As soon as she came to the ""med conclusion"", it was like she had ruled and nothing I could have said could have changed her thoughts.

>Here’s a tip: If you have trouble communicating on the spot, maybe you can take your time and write out what you want to say and bring it in to your next session for her to read.

 I actually managed to give her maybe 10-15 pages of content that I had been typing with great difficulty over a period of months, about the problems and traits that I have which are centered around autism. But I am now thinking that I did not mention a few key things. Unfortunately, the last appointment was my last session with her. There are only 4 appointments in total.

>Lay out your concerns- she’s not hearing you, you don’t want your anxiety to be the focus, you want to learn more about your ASD diagnosis and how it’s affected you in the past, present and how it could happen in the future, etc. ask her to “pause and hear me”. It’s so very important that she hears that, and how she reacts will let you know if her skillset is the right one for you. 

She knew very well that I went in specifically for autism. I have very few choices for professionals who have experience diagnosing adults.

 I really like your phrasing here, but  I don't think I could ever do that even if I memorized it because I avoid confrontation at all costs due to verbal and emotional abuse,  which I also mentioned to her."
autism,eu0acko,t1_eu057fp,1563344497.0," well, because a stigma is usually associated with lack of knowledge or  lack of  thinking about things.  the psychologist acted like I had never considered medication before. And then  when I told her I had, she basically tried to invalidate any previous experience I had simply because I was not taking medications presently  which was not what she wanted me to do.

 I will attempt to explain my views  in why I am very uneasy about it.

*  I have noticed a lot of doctors who just think they know everything, or are biased toward that end. I don't know how they come about this mindset during their education and such, but it also seems prevalent throughout society not just with doctors as well.  lots of people will assert they know what they are talking about,  but I've come to realize the hard way to not take that literally,  to go find other knowledge to corroborate it.
*   in reality,  modern society knows very little about how the human brain works. if you disagree, the easiest way for me to persuade is to say to think about what professionals knew 20-50 years ago about the brain compared to now.  A modern day professional would probably say they knew very little back then. however, somebody from 30 years ago  would probably  think they knew a lot about the brain and say that someone from 60 years ago new very little about the brain. in essense, I believe that professionals from each generation do not have a good perspective  across time. Maybe because they are focused too much on learning and applying the details in the present.
*  to those who think the brain is just another organ: The brain is the most complex organ of the body,  And therefore the slowest to be understood and the most complex to ""tinker with"".   as an engineer-at-heart  who tinkers with things, I would never tinker with a machine so important like the brain  so much when knowing so little about it.
* one particular thing with not understanding the brain:  we cannot explain how consciousness exists, or  our perception of a soul, and I don't want to screw  mine up.  scientists can study chemicals for an eternity, but I believe there is more to the brain than just that, Maybe it is more electrical and not chemical. Maybe it is something we're not even aware of, on a different level. We have no way of studying or detecting with present day technology.
*  prescribing a medication is the easiest form of treatment, and therefore everyone is biased  toward it.  Doctors have a lot of patients to see, so they are incentivized to go as fast as they can.  Needing refills keep you in the system, too,  which means more money for them.  some doctors are more biased than others, and this is difficult to prove, but still
*  I've had adverse reactions or side effects to many medications before, including  when I was very young and was given anxiety medication, and so there is no way to predict what my reactions might be to other medication
* 4 of my past friends ( and that's a high ratio because I have not had that many friends, so I am thinking about what that means...) (all around my age ) have taken medication for depression, anxiety, and / or ADHD, and they all told me negative, alarming experiences with it and stopped taking it, except for one who keeps taking it despite an alarming negative ongoing experience because he said the benefit still outweighed the negative part for him. He had ADHD.
*   depending on the individual medications which I am not familiar with,  I would associate some as like a pain pill for headaches. The pill does not take care of the actual problem, it just masks it temporarily.
* even if they are ""not habit forming"",  I am very worried about becoming dependent on them. because if it did make me feel better, then I would want to keep taking it and I would feel dependent on it.
*  all of the above causes me anxiety just thinking about it, which makes me never able to take the pills
*  I am a very cautious person in general,  not just with medication

 I do need to do more research. But these are my current thoughts."
autism,esk63d5,t1_esj73c7,1562052625.0,"> due to the financial strain, I am not able to get such a specialized and trained animal

 yeah I know what you mean. $20k? Yikes

 emotional support animals are  the same cost as getting any pet though.  no extra money needed for specialized training. just the money needed to feed them, etc.

> feeling faint/dizzy

 it's not normal to feel faint or dizzy. You should have that checked out,  if you haven't already.  a service dog may be able to help with that as well when the event happens, hypothetically, but I'm not sure. they take physical issues into account as well

> I guess no one saw this post?

Dunno.  mysteries of social media"
autism,esj5f7r,t3_c7pbft,1562026365.0," not sure why there are no replies Yet to you. I have watched several youtube videos on the subject. There is one youtuber who comes to mind who is autistic and has a service dog. Many of his videos relate to this. [Here's a decent one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXbk8cCx9vc&t=265)

 In short, the service dog is specifically trained for the specific person's issues.  he has mentioned:

*  the dog creates a buffer of space between him and a crowd of people.  people notice the dog and give him room.
*  during sensory issues, the dog can sense these and help  the owner stop them, like by pawing  or laying down on them (""provide deep pressure"") or leading them to a safer place, or just help them  become self aware that they are having the episode.
*  all of the benefits of an emotional support animal (USA terminology)

 I have considered one myself, but I'm significantly allergic.  unfortunately that little detail was an oversight when the US government made  laws about service animals. I have no firsthand experience to talk about. 

 you may want to look into an emotional support animal. However, they have no public rights like a service dog,  at least in the US.  for example, I don't believe any Walmart would allow them in the store.  he talks about the issue that store employees won't even allow his service dog in the store, even though he has that right legally. an emotional support animal can be any kind of animal. However, a service animal must be a dog, or I have read about a miniature horse. (I cannot imagine how a miniature horse has public rights to go just about everywhere, but I guess they do.  can a cat not be trained to  provide the same benefits as a service dog?)"
