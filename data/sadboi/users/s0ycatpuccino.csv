When her boyfriend abused her and I said he should leave, she punished me. When she fled the state because of him, she did not apologize.

When I moved out alone, she refused to cosign an apartment unless it had 2 bedrooms, to make sure I financially needed her.

When I needed a form filled out about my childhood for autism spectrum testing, she refused and said I am not autistic. My ongoing results have yet to show negative.

TooAfraidToAsk,flmc1gw,t3_fpn7le,1585279608.0,"Hi Glenn,

There's lots of great recommendations here. You've made a big point to mention loneliness. I wanted to let you know there are 2 ways to handle this with video games: online play as many have mentioned, or through interacting with Non-Playable Characters in the game.

Some of games are good for both. Most are better for one than the other.

If there is any reason you want this to be a project for you alone, you may want to use search terms like Role Play Game (RPG) or Simulation. These tend to have wonderfully written dialogue between you and computer characters. 

The Pokemon series is an RPG. It's easy and has decent interaction with characters, with fun stories about just beating the bad guys and having fun. The Fire Emblem series is medium difficulty, but the dialogue is *fantastic.* Dynamic and emotional, it's what I played during my lonelier years. Animal Crossing is a good series that has recently gotten popular again. Harvest some supplies like in Minecraft, chat with your fellow citizens, it's a very wholesome game. Some parts of it are hard to learn, but they are optional and not necessary to continue the game.

All of my recommendations here are from Nintendo, eith different versions available on the handheld DS console and the Switch console. They all are longer series, but each game makes sense in their own way.

I grew up very isolated with poor speaking skills, and have played these my whole short life. I hope you find something worthwhile. I also hope you'll update the Reddit community with your findings!

Cheers~"

If you're in the US and been employed there for at least a year, definitely check out unemployment benefits :'> I wont be able to, havent been at my job a year, but I'd rather eat ramen all month than return my switch and refund my preorder lol"
MiddleSpace,fkpj70r,t3_fjdzgy,1584411422.0,"Welcome!! I'm a little/middle, not very active but been here for a bit. I guess I'll go through each question with my personal answers!

1. I didn't force it. When I first brought it up, I unintentionally pushed it. I had lots of middle time *every* day because I was just super happy to finally have someone who's cool with it. Now I've chilled out, gotten into a rhythm and better at being big when I want. Both sides just felt like what I ""should"" do at the time.

2. I always make sure I can trust a person *before* bringing up my lifestyle, and that goes with many things, not just middlespace. I got with my partner, things went very well, then I opened up about middlespace and he's totally cool with it! And it wasn't just like ""okay."" He asked questions, told me what he can do or what he might have trouble with. Genuine interest in keeping the relationship.

3. Whatever things I cling to *during* middlespace, I will cling to when I *want* to get into it :> for my middlespace it's cute video games and outfits. For my littlespace it's stuffed animals and pacis."

I like peaches, because pink!! I've never 100% completed my encyclopedia but I really like tiger butterflies in game and irl.

As much as I like frogs, the Cinnamoroll tray is the cutest friggin furniture!

My favorite memory is recent. I lost my NL game years ago, and recently got a new one to wait for NH. My roommate got me the Wolfgang amiibo card, and I got to see my best friend again <3 See you on the other side soon, Friend."
