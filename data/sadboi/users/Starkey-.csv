Would I be ok if they left me? 
Would someone else love them/get along with them better?
Would I be happier with someone else/who didn’t have these negative traits?
Do I see a long term future with this person?
Would I want to marry/have kids and build a life?
Are the issues able to be worked out?
Are they willing to listen, willing to be wrong, willing to do the work to grow etc

But you should not solely rely on someone else choosing you or needing to be in a relationship as your only happiness. Needing validation from others to feel loved is a recipe for disaster, because it makes us lose our self worth and chase love to feel happy. 

When we chase love too much we often end up sacrificing who we are in order to keep that person, and end up codependent because they are in charge of our happiness. Somebody being responsible for your happiness is actually a burden because nobody else can ever do the work for you, that’s why they call it self-worth.

Try to build your life to be happy single and love your life without a boyfriend, whatever that means for you specifically. When you can truly be happy by yourself then look at finding someone to be with you as an *addition* to your happiness instead of the *sole reason*. :)"

Anxiety,fpu6h4v,t3_gfhkcd,1588905712.0,"Basically what you’re describing is the real you when you truly feel safe, and the “other you” that people see when you are anxious and feel unsafe.

Trauma whether small or large can have a major impact on us, and how/when we feel safe. Social settings especially around strangers can present so many different variables that we are often “triggered” even in small ways depending on our wounds. It’s not like a major PTSD panic attack but we always feel that worry in our minds. Our brains are on the lookout for ways we may be hurt in a similar way again, and we are unable to truly be ourselves in crowds or in public spaces. Even acquaintances or friends sometimes still don’t present enough safety signals for us to be our true self because we get wired to feel unsafe.

It truly is rare to feel safe, loved, and fully at ease when you have anxiety. But I agree with you, it can be overcome and when I can actually let my guard down I am not anxious at all - in fact I am quite the opposite, I am extremely talkative and funny and not at all what I am like when anxious. So maybe “social anxiety” isn’t an accurate term for all of us, maybe its a more selective anxiety because not all humans make me anxious, but most do... 

I think this is why many anxious people feel they are introverted, because it’s easier to be alone/at home where we’ve established safety. But in certain settings or around the right people, we can be incredibly social! That real you is always there, so keep working to overcome your anxiety <3

You need to re-evaluate your self worth! Why are you accepting less than you deserve? The question isn’t “is this possible to come back from” it’s why are you WANTING to keep coming back from a progressively worsening situation? Please OP, let this man go."

I used opiates for a year and they worked well but obviously my tolerance got skyhigh and I couldnt keep upping my dose indefinitely. I think Subs do similar but because of the ceiling effect they kind of level out where you don’t have to increase. My nerves may be out of whack because I shouldn’t have as much pain as I do with how minor my injury was...

Suboxone worked really well at first, and for a few months it was great. I’d say the first 1-2 years it was still solid, I’d take 8mg around 10am and 8mg around 5-5pm and it got me through everyday. But I’ve been on it 4 years now, and the last year I felt like I was getting less relief so I’m tapering down to see if a lower dose helps or I’ll just get off completely and try other options."
relationships,fp4uy4f,t3_gb2bi3,1588308052.0,"Okay I hope I can say this in a way where people don’t rip my head off, but stick with me. Here goes nothing:

First off, I’m not saying he’s right or wrong. This is not my opinion. Just trying to explain.

From what I read in your post, it seems you and your mom may have misconstrued what he said big time, and it happens a lot around conspiracy theories. They can be very triggering when it revolves around an event where people ARE DYING. 

I get it, you hear somebody talking about a “conspiracy theory” and you think they’ve lost their minds believing the “entire government is out to get us”. It can sound outlandish when somebody starts saying things contrary to what the news is telling all of us. Especially when there is concrete evidence the thing is REAL.

But, everybody needs to realize when some people follow or talk about a conspiracy theory,  that not all of them are as outrageous as others. Some theories are ridiculous yes, however some are actually believable. Calling them all the same umbrella term in a negative light doesn’t help settle any arguments or differences if somebody is still within reason. And heres why:

The word “hoax” really triggers people. Much like “false flag”. They see these terms and think somebody is claiming the things are “NOT REAL”. This is not always the case. There is a huge difference between saying something is “fake news” that is being exaggerated or lied about, versus saying something is completely not real or outright fake. 

From what you’ve said, it sounds like saying he’s saying he believes the virus is being EXAGGERATED and the media is lying about the numbers etc. That is a BIG difference between him outright saying “The virus DOESN’T EXIST”. Do you see what I’m saying? 

If he is simply under the belief (through social media, radio, or whoever said these things) that the virus is being exaggerated, or the numbers are being lied about, perhaps for some ulterior motive then that is a big difference then him saying it’s not real at all. If it is the latter than yes he may have gone off the deep end. 

Perhaps he has been convinced by a youtube documentary or some other personality online or in real life, and if he already had an underlying distrust of the government he could’ve bought into it very easily. People always believe the government has an “agenda” or is screwing them over somehow. 

Add in the anxiety and feelings of uncertainty amidst this pandemic and suddenly he finally switched to not believing the news anymore. If you think about it, it might actually be a defence mechanism, as if he believes the virus is being overblown it would mean he isn’t in as much danger as he previously thought! 

Again I am not endorsing nor disagreeing with this theory, just giving you an explanation of where he may be coming from and how to move forward with him.

All you need to do is ask him, “hey dad, mom seems concerned that you don’t believe in this coronavirus now. Is that true, do you think it’s actually fake, OR do you just believe the numbers are being lied and/or exaggerated about for some agenda?” Have a calm conversation about it with him and ask where he’s coming from and what he actually believes instead of assuming the worst and confronting him and arguing which will make him defensive. I assume that’s what your mom did when she heard him say this originally and that’s why it escalated. 

Hope this helps!"

suboxone,fp4nzg5,t1_fp4itn8,1588303251.0,"I should reword or make a new post, I wasn’t meaning I thought it physically stopped the body from healing, I was mostly asking about decreased pain tolerance, increased sensitivity, and tolerance to the Bupe which all makes it less effective in managing pain and also makes your pain “feel worse” even if the tissues are healing or staying the same. 

Also I’ve spent thousands of dollars onPhysio and Massage, also done some Chiro and Acupuncture with no improvement that’s why I feel like I’m not fully healing, maybe the more accurate description would be my neck is healed but my pain isn’t going away."
suboxone,fp4njqc,t1_fp4jisz,1588302967.0,"Yeah thank you! Thats pretty much what I expected to hear, but I appreciate you commenting. I basically already knew this answer but think I fooled myself into thinking Bupe was special for a long time as I read people took it for pain, so continued taking it for years despite the reduced analgesia. 

After all it’s still an opiate, just a partial agonist. Like the others you eventually build a tolerance - but with Bupe you can’t increase the dose indefinitely because of the ceiling... so you’re kinda limited. Finally after 3 years at the same dose I’ve gone from 16mg down to 8mg, its not helping anymore and I need to get off it fully to try to allow my pain tolerance and sensitization to return back to normal.

I definitely feel you on the effectiveness, imagine if a painkiller stayed the same forever and you never had to increase dose. God it’d be nice to have consistent pain management forever like those first days of trying opiates..."
suboxone,fp42f58,t1_fp3l4xf,1588290353.0,"Well Suboxone is the only prescription I take and it has become less and less effective in managing the pain over time, so either it has stopped working as well as it was or my pain has gotten worse. Either way I certainly haven’t gotten better despite a lot of time and medical treatment. 

Long term opiate use has been shown to make many chronic pain conditions feel worse with longterm use, and considering buprenorphine is a partial opiate agonist is it that far fetched to think it could have the same effect?

I’m just looking for other people’s experiences to see if they’ve had their pain improve or worsen while taking it, and if they feel like they’ve built a tolerance to the analgesic effect from Suboxone or it’s still just as effective years later."
suboxone,fp33j8q,t1_fp31mdb,1588272468.0,"It definitely worked wonders for my pain at first, I would take my dose in the morning and go all day without pain - but after a few weeks/months I found the painkilling aspect would only last 4-6 hours.

I was on 16mg a day for over 3 years straight, so I wonder if I was on way too high. I took 8mg in the morning and 8mg in the evening

I feel like I’ve built a tolerance or my pains gotten worse somehow. I take my dose just to take the edge off but I don’t even fully get out of pain anymore, not even for a couple hours... I’ve dropped down to 4mg twice a day to see if a lower dose will help."
Anxiety,fp16nid,t3_gahj36,1588225898.0,"These kind of reminders and trying to be grateful are more helpful for acute depression, like if someone is upset after losing a job or breakup maybe, but chronic mental health problems they can actually make anxiety worse because you know you have things that “should” make you feel happy but you’re still uneasy, anxious, worried, etc. and makes you feel “ungrateful” or “guilty” for not being happier.

Anxiety is usually regardless of what our life is like, we can have a home, food, family, friends but our thoughts and beliefs keep us suffering because we are stuck constantly anxious. Being reminded of the “good” we have doesn’t change our stress, it can be helped over time by mindfulness and diet and exercise but a simple gratitude list doesn’t fix it. I hope your therapist wasn’t that dismissive."

confidence,fox02xs,t3_g9ha9j,1588130905.0,"Remember, confidence isn't about thinking everyone likes you, it's about being okay even if nobody does. You have to learn how to love yourself.

If you can realize your worth is not about being chosen or being liked or fitting in with everyone you meet than you can experience some freedom. Ask yourself, do I need everybody to like me? If they don't like me, am I going to act differently? The fact you automatically assume makes me think there is some importance placed on their judging of you.

When you don't love yourself, you try to find that love in other people through their approval. How can you not feel insecure in who you are around people when so much is riding on it? This often results in sacrificing who you are to put on an image all the time because when you care so much about being liked, you will do ANYTHING to not be DISLIKED which leads to insecurity, social anxiety, low self-esteem and all the things you listed because you're trying not to be disliked.

“We all have insecurities and need to realize everybody else isn’t as perfectly put together and confident as we think they are, and they worry about saying the wrong things or appearing stupid too.

Usually in social interactions, the other person is more worried about THEMSELVES than they are about nitpicking or overanalyzing you! People are living in their own world, not yours. 

Its like the saying about the 18-40-60 rule:

At 18 you worry about everyone judging you

At 40 you stop caring what people think

At 60 you realize they were never thinking about you to begin with”

If he agree’d to date you, he thinks you are attractive. I’m sure he already knows some basics about your personality etc. so relax a bit! It’s normal to have nerves on a date... We are all human and nobody is perfect, it’s not always easy to be yourself right away but remember you want somebody to like you for you so don’t be something you’re not. 

I bet he’s as nervous as you lol. Everytime I’ve hungout with a girl I liked I couldn’t give a rats ass about them saying something dumb or silly or awkward I’m too worried about not embarrassing myself in front of them!"

suboxone,fot4034,t1_forxu0x,1588044137.0,I got off a decent Fentanyl addiction 5.5 years ago using Kratom for a week and was in the clear... I thought it was a wonder plant that nobody had ever mentioned or heard of! It took away 70-80% of the WDs and was a godsend. I didn’t even know it was addictive back then!
