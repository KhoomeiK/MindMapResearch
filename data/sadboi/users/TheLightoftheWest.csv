Thank you for wanting to!

‚ÄúBehavioral Health Centers‚Äù are unconstitutional. We can‚Äôt be locking people up without due process and forcing drugs into them. People who are held longer than a day in jail, are generally violent. Even they can leave with bail, and then they‚Äôre rightfully protected by the full burden of proof to convict them at trial. 

I am not against people‚Äôs right to seek out medication that may help them, or of a psychiatrist to recommend them. Though I do think the neurology is in, and that they should be strongly discouraged/warned about/dissuaded. Psy meds cause bad neurological perturbations over time, that lead to tolerance, increased use, and worse side effects. Withdrawal is tormenting, which further entrenches the sunk cost anecdotal report of individuals who attest to the meds they‚Äôve been taking/paying for/believe in as necessary.  
It‚Äôs a travesty. Many people, like myself, initially trusted their psychiatrist as a proper doctor, but once you‚Äôre on their meds and slapped with a label, it‚Äôs hard to get off and the stigma strains relationships.

But again, legally the Mental Hospital system needs to be reigned in. That matters the most. And it would save a lot of honest people money. We shouldn‚Äôt be taxed to lock up and force drugs into people."
Antipsychiatry,fnzncas,t3_g4pfpg,1587397319.0,"Glad you found this!

If it is ‚Äòscience‚Äô I would call it bad science. The pharmaceutical industry buries negative and publishes positive results. 

Science is Physics Chemistry and Biology.

Nowadays, every study wants to tag the word ‚Äòscience..‚Äô  while I think social sciences, political science, psychology, psychiatry, economics.. etc can be helpful, they are certainly misleading and abused. Having the credit of ‚Äúscience‚Äù wrongly bolsters their authority.

Since pharmacy psychiatry cannot empirically test, cure, or even posit repeatable efficacy with their treatments, it‚Äôs not only antiscience, but antihealthcare (unlike Neuroscience.)

Psychiatry in its best form, points to freewill and virtue, its etymological origin is in ‚Äúsoul healing.‚Äù Their role is guiding people to a healthier mentality.

I don‚Äôt fight People seeking medications/drugs. 

There shouldn‚Äôt be a class of people deciding who can and can‚Äôt choose to pay for designer drugs. Neurologists maybe best suited to dissuade use or permit safe dosages if the individual insists, but if psychiatrists want to recommend too, I have little problem with them.

My main stance is simple. ‚ÄúBehavioral Health Centers‚Äù are unconstitutional. We can‚Äôt be locking people up without due process and forcing drugs into them. People who are held longer than a day in jail, are generally violent. Even they can leave with bail, and then they‚Äôre rightfully protected by the full burden of proof to convict them at trial."

prolife,fnyh8hf,t1_fnyccu0,1587363016.0,"That may happen or the extremely harmful drugs literally abort a life. Abortafacient drugs very often end a life after conception. ‚ÄúHormones in moderation‚Äù are safe, when you make good choices and your body healthfully produces them. But no, hormones are not safe - especially abortion inducing drugs. Even mild doctor prescribed hormones (beyond topical meds,) like growth hormones for someone who is short or contraceptives, can each dramatically defect puberty and increase cancer risk. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say 10-20x more, those graphs are extremely misleading because the popularity of over the counter meds like plan b, which are not documented as abortion, end up taking the life of countless unique people. 

Suffering is nothing next to oblivion. The development of life in the womb changes very little about abortion. It‚Äôs only worse when they feel pain."
prolife,fnya3wn,t1_fnxzatm,1587357248.0,"I‚Äôll be sure to save that link.

You‚Äôre right about a source of undocumented abortion, but I guess that would be low relatively. Many are over the counter, like plan b, where the two involved have little idea whether or not conception occurred, and it‚Äôs not recorded in Guttmacher‚Äôs statistics. It‚Äôs also extremely harmful/carcinogenic to the potential mother. They‚Äôre strong hormonal drugs.

Abortion is a sick complicated mess. Culture trying to mask lust with freedom.. Foolish pleasure may seem extremely hard to change, but the reason and value of family and procreation can be communed with love. 

There‚Äôs a lot of tragedy and travesty out there, but choosing life really is easiest. It‚Äôs sin and death that suffer and lose most.. this is our only existence we may be sure about. Forgiving is perfect love, and it will come around, especially bearing life.
