One is a group of consenting adults, while the others are attracted to people (minors) who can't consent. Pedophiles literally ruin children's life and cause them lifelong traumas. They should receive serious help and if they act on their impulses they should be held accountable to the full extent of the law."

Capitalism,fc0mjhg,t3_efg5qi,1577294586.0,"The issue with communism is that in theory, it looks appealing to a lot of people. A world without discrimination, in which everyone is equal. 

I personally don't find it appealing for the sole reason that I believe in meritocracy. That does not mean I believe in inequality, but it is a fact that not everyone deserves to live under the same conditions, since it opens a way for parasitic individuals. For example, a hard working professional who has high aspirations is limited to live under the same conditions as let's say, a paedophile. It doesn't sound fair, right? 

It is also a fact that an equal, classless society will never exist. Even in communist states, there's hierarchy, and they evidently live better than the rest of the population. Take Nicolas Maduro, for instance. Or Daniel Ortega, Kim Jong Un... The list goes on. A lot of times the wrong people end up in charge. False communists.

However, it is a fact that our current society doesn't give everyone the same starting points. An upper middle class student has higher chances of having a successful life than the kid of a poor family. I believe that to the extent that it is possible, people, regardless of their economical status, should have access to education, medical care, a opportunity to have a better life. It is impossible to achieve an equal society, but some inequalities can be diminished.

Personally, I don't defend neither capitalism or communism, more like a middle ground. I would recommend you talk to communists with an open mind, you can learn a lot. Do not enter an eco chamber, and don't take it so personal: it's not worth it. You're just 15, I'm 17. However, I can assure you that those two years make a big difference, so, keep an open mind."

I genuinely thought I was in love with this guy and I would have done everything for him. I remember how miserable I would feel every time he got another girl or started actually dating someone. I felt something was missing in me, like I wasn't enough for him? And every time, regardless of how much shit he pulled on me, I would be back, no questions asked. I always forgave him and even apologized when I had been the victim. Sometimes I still think about him, but thankfully I was able to break loose from that curse that was holding me hostage. I've never felt more trapped than when I loved him. Because damn I did and he never saw me as more than a hookup and that's alright you know.
