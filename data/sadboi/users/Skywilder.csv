Fun fact - 
In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, similar to the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven National Laboratory open house.

Another fun fact -
Adolf Hitler‚Äôs date of death is April 30, 1945.

A final fun fact -
Both of these facts required nothing more than a simple search.

These first two fun facts mean it was physically impossible for Hitler to have ever played video games. They did not exist until a good thirteen years after his death. Again, looking forward to your scholarly articles! I‚Äôd love to see you prove me wrong."

Really grinds my gears.
troubledteens,fp83v0l,t3_gbnqip,1588382645.0,"Yes and no. 

Yes in that they are a business, so they are run like a business, hiring a lot of IMMENSELY under qualified staff, program directors are usually distant and just come by from time to time to make sure the place hasn‚Äôt been burned down or covered in shit due to an uprising. There‚Äôs a lot of neglect, because honestly we aren‚Äôt treated as anyone‚Äôs kids. The program literally has custody of us. That makes the program, ‚ÄúA FUCKING BUSINESS‚Äù in charge of our lives. Not a parent/parents. Usually we had a bunch of college/fresh out of college fuckwits for staff. Funniest and most fucked up was one of my supervisors named Dusty at Discovery Ranch. Dude looked exactly like Ryan Reynolds, If he did meth every other weekend. Dusty had fucked up teeth and it was general knowledge he liked to gamble on his off time. He could be an asshole but sometimes he wasn‚Äôt so bad, if he liked you. Well he must‚Äôve hit it big because one day, Dusty didn‚Äôt show up for work. Never said goodbye to a single one of us. Rumor had it he hit it big, and just up and left. A good old fashioned unspoken fuck you to every single student. Then there was Dani. Dani was absolutely gorgeous, and genuinely cared for every student. Dani was around twenty something years young. She cared with all her heart about every student, and would readily sit down and chat with us about whatever. Made us feel like we were kids, not convicts or freaks.

Long story short, programs aren‚Äôt designed to be comfortable. It‚Äôs when a program goes out of its way to be more mentally/physically taxing than necessary that it becomes ‚Äúbad‚Äù.

I went to a couple treatment centers and Pacific Quest Hawaii (adolescent program) was by far the one I could actually respect. While it was incredibly mentally and physically taxing, I learned a fuckload there. I have remained clean from self harm for years now, and it hardly crosses my mind. I would equate Pacific Quest Hawaii with military basic training - it was the most fun I never want to have again. Of course, I have had people also say they felt PQ was a horrible fucked up place. It could be miserable at times for sure but I personally felt like that was treatment done correctly. Of course, everything I say must be taken with a grain of salt. This was over four years ago, and staff and procedures have no doubt changed by now."
