BPD,fr2pecv,t1_fr1p98v,1589841385.0,"Yeah... I think this hits the nail on the head. It's not intentional manipulation (see: ASPD) so much as it's lack of skill. There's often lot of cognitive dissonance in the mind of a pwBPD between how they feel (and a desire to openly express how they feel) and the perception of what's socially acceptable. So, we end up simultaneously trying to show and hide our emotions. It's often strained and can come off as contrived or manipulative.

Example:  
*I feel excluded by my friends (maybe they didn't invite me to a party or something), and I want to tell them that they hurt my feelings, BUT I'm worried (probably with good reason) that making a big deal out of the situation will make me look like a lunatic. So, instead of skillfully regulating my emotions (getting over it) or skillfully navigating the relationship (either being direct with my friends or getting new/better friends), I pout or otherwise act in such a way as to get my friends to notice my unhappiness (this is what disappointed me all along, that no one noticed that they'd hurt me), and this behavior comes off as manipulation. Really, it's not so much intentional or malicious manipulation, so much as it is lack of social and emotional skill.*"

BPD,fo7vg34,t1_fo7joyq,1587585227.0,"I would say that it’s helped. I think the first thing that happened was that I became more aware of my vulnerabilities. For me, sleep is huge. If I lose sleep over a few nights in a row, I lose my mind. Next, I became aware of the moments right before I started to lose emotional control. When you start to notice it happening, you have a chance to make a different choice. I’m not 100%, but I’m way better than I used to be. Finally, I think I’m more aware of what’s motivating my urges. I know when I want to seek comfort in other people, so I have an opportunity to practice opposite action, build dignity, and not do that stuff."
BPD,fo7iojw,t1_fo7ccnl,1587578994.0,"Pushing back a little bit on that last paragraph: Acceptance is about facts, not judgments. “I’m a piece of shit,” is a judgment. “I’m a person with BPD who only just recently started learning how to effectively manage my emotions and behavior,” is a fact. I think sticking to hard facts ends up being more effective, because it not only prevents you from denying reality/responsibility, but it also creates some space for you to be empathetic to yourself and hopeful that you can change (because it prevents you from using negative judgments about yourself as an excuse to give up or sabotage yourself). I don’t know if it’s a universal feature, but I think most people with BPD need to work on being less judgmental (of BOTH others and themselves) and more factual in their thinking. 

Yeah, I’m in a DBT program now. I’ve been in and out of therapy for 30 years, and most of it seemed unhelpful. DBT has really done me a lot of good, though. We’re meeting virtually now, because of the pandemic, and that’s actually been better for me from a time commitment standpoint. 

DBT borrows a lot from behaviorism as a theoretical framework. It’s not Freudian (which is good, because Freud doesn’t have much of an evidence base). It doesn’t spend really any time on psychoanalysis. A good book for understanding behaviorism is Don’t Shoot the Dog. Might be worth a look if you’re like me and want to know the big picture ideas."
BPD,fo7bdcr,t1_fo78v3t,1587575449.0,"The group portion of DBT might not be what you’re expecting. It’s not a bunch of people sitting in a circle sharing whiny stories. There’s not much sharing at all. It works a lot more like a college seminar where they teach you strategies for dealing with emotional overload or difficulties in relationships. You then practice those in real life and trouble shoot them in individual sessions with your therapist. It’s very strategic and solutions focused, and I think that’s why it works. 

WRT the relationship stuff, what you’re experiencing (fear of abandonment, intolerance of being alone) is classic BPD. Our emotions are so strong, and they can feel so unbearable, that we look to other people for support and stability. Relationships, for us, are coping strategies in much the same way that drug use is a coping strategy for someone with an addiction problem. What’s fucked up is that those kind of relationships aren’t really “love” in any meaningful sense. They’re exploitative, because we’re merely using other people to make use feel better. We use other people to avoid that sense of emptiness or loneliness, or to buffer us against thoughts that we’re worthless (or whatever). You fee extra shitty when exiting a relationship, because you have all those negative feelings (rejection, loneliness, abandonment), and you don’t have a choice but to confront them alone (without the aid of the relationship that you had previously used for stability). But the way that you can know that the relationship was exploitative is that you’re resistant to letting the other person move on, even when that’s CLEARLY what’s in their best interest. 

I think what we all want is a healthy relationship. But you 100% can’t have that until you learn to cope with your emotions and urges on your own without looking to a relationship to prop you up. Totally recognize that’s easier said than done (from experience). But it’s not impossible, just hard."
BPD,fo77epa,t1_fo72335,1587573536.0,"A couple of things here:

I want to be clear that I’m not implying any judgment in my response (not sure if you took it that way, but just to be on the safe side I thought I should say so).

Secondly, if you’re not doing a full DBT program, you’re not doing DBT. The empirical evidence for DBT only holds up if you follow the program the way it was originally designed. If you alter the program (by getting rid of the group component and mid-week phone coaching or by blending it was CBT), you lose the evidentiary basis that the therapy you’re receiving will work. That doesn’t mean it definitely won’t work - only that there is no evidence that it will. If you want to do a deeper dive into DBT (and I totally recommend it - it’s been very helpful to me), you should purchase the DBT Skills Training workbook (it’s spiral bound) by Marsha Linehan. You can also check out r/DBTselfhelp. I think that community is really pretty great. It would be better, though, to enroll in an official DBT program if you can. 

I also want to push you a little bit on the reality acceptance bit. For example, suicidal ideation is a form of escapism, and escapism is always rooted in denial. Denial concerns itself with statements like “I wish it weren’t like this...” or “this is unfair...” or “if only I had done things differently...” All that stuff is escapism, too. I know that when I’ve been suffering the worst, I’ve been most tempted to engage in that kind of denial, AND most blind to the fact that I was attempting to deny reality."
BPD,fo6yis3,t3_g62qly,1587569079.0,"Step one is coming to terms with reality. I sort of see you wrestling with that here. You accept that the problems are your fault and that you need to change. On the other hand, you’re expressing regret about not being diagnosed earlier (regret is a backward looking form of reality denial) and hope to be reunited with an ex you abused (a forward looking form of reality denial). 

This is stuff that will come up in DBT, but if you’ve got the manual, you might start reading ahead. Check out the Reality Acceptance Skills."

BPD,fnuywqv,t3_g40m67,1587274955.0,"I think it might be helpful to ask yourself if anger is the primary or secondary emotion that you’re feeling. Often times, I react to things that make me sad with anger, because the sadness feels intolerable. And anger is a proactive emotion, so it feels energizing while sadness feels deflating. It might be that being excluded makes you feel sad or lonely or unwanted, and that you react with anger because those emotions are so difficult to bear."

Even small things that don’t go my way send me into a rage. If the rage is blocked for some reason, even my own efforts at self control, I fall into a self destructive despair. 

So, the target for me in therapy right now is to learn how to not identify with my emotions (i.e. “I feel like a failure, therefore I am a failure.”). Then, hopefully, I’ll learn to just be sad or disappointed instead of engaging in a self-loathing spiral or temper tantrum."

BPD,fn7v954,t1_fn5h4bn,1586728329.0,"I was misdiagnosed for years. I knew my diagnoses didn't fit, so I ended up doing a bunch of research on my own.

I then took it to a psychiatrist who agreed, and my current DBT therapist agrees as well.

It's funny, because I feel like it's such an obvious diagnosis for anyone who has known me for a long time, but it was very difficult for me to get - and took decades to arrive at.

So, I think it's very important to be informed and to advocate for yourself, but it's best to do that within the context of professional help. We know ourselves better than anyone else does, but that doesn't mean we're immune to motivated reasoning."

If you've got questions regarding diagnosis or any of the issues you've spelled out here, they're best addressed by a professional. None of us here are really qualified to give that kind of advice."
BPD,fkch8e1,t3_fch2yi,1584053028.0,Play nice.
BPD,fk2beej,t3_fg10lv,1583797253.0,Removed due to violation of Rule 4
BPD,fjtqkvi,t3_fez7xx,1583610092.0,Hey. Locked the comments here. This is a discussion you should be having with your doctor.
BPD,fjtp6eb,t3_fetnky,1583609799.0,Reminder to everyone to keep it civil.
BPD,fjl9mve,t3_fdfu4g,1583442591.0,Reminder to play nice.
BPD,fjbk03e,t1_fj8nplb,1583195012.0,"I'll allow the question for discussion sake, but let's not diagnose each other online."
BPD,fjbjuy1,t3_fccb8e,1583194919.0,Just chiming in to say that you definitely don't have to experience trauma in order to have BPD.
BPD,fjbjby8,t1_fja2tr5,1583194576.0,"Imma let this slide, but let's not try to diagnose people based on a single post."
BPD,fjbixol,t3_fcikm6,1583194319.0,"I'm sorry that you had this experience. People with personality disorders can be difficult to be in relationships with, and they can definitely be abusive. I know that your past experiences are going to inform your current attitudes (this is normal), but I hope that you can come to see that pwBPD are individuals. Some of us are more aware (or less aware) of our shortcomings than others. Some of us do a better job (or a worse job) of correcting our behaviors and thoughts than others do. Frankly, BPD is so common and so under-diagnosed that I'm confident that you've had positive relationships with pwBPD in the past and didn't even realize that they had a personality disorder. I don't know if this is the kind of feedback your looking for, but I hope that it at least makes sense."
psychotherapy,fj6yo9d,t1_fj6yhi1,1583082893.0,"Good deal. But to your original point, I think it's a good idea to take some steps toward virtual appointments with your clients."
BPD,fj6yjfr,t3_fbu5jl,1583082816.0,This is great. Feels a lot like the radical acceptance they teach in DBT.
BPD,fj6ygtg,t3_fbu6iv,1583082776.0,"I think you might be experiencing something that's not a typical BPD symptom, and it's maybe prudent to bring this up with a therapist or psychologist."
psychotherapy,fj6u8gx,t1_fj6tagi,1583080279.0,I know. Which is why I was saying the person I replied to was full of shit.
psychotherapy,fj6sewq,t1_fj6p7j5,1583079151.0,"Lmfao. This is so inaccurate. You should delete.

Edit: Let's play a game. You cite your sources that it's slower spreading and less dangerous than the flu, and I'll cite mine. We'll compare and see which ones are more credible."
BPD,fg44z3d,t1_fg43yj5,1580496268.0,"Sadly more common than it should be, wrt BPD."
Psychiatry,fg0nfw7,t3_evz23x,1580411329.0,"This feels so much like the early conversations about medical cannabis. It's a breakthrough treatment. Oops, jk, [it causes psychosis in some people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6546656/) and we don't know why.

Until we have more RCT's, treating psychiatric illness with psilocybin is little more than throwing chemicals into a black box and hoping for the best."
BPD,fg028kx,t3_ew0vhb,1580398596.0,Lots of speculation here. Gentle reminder to not engage in medical or psychiatric advice. Also worth noting that there are no medications currently approved for the treatment of BPD (at least in the USA) and that individual experiences with medication will vary.
BPD,ffy84ro,t3_evtiyc,1580340419.0,"Sometimes, but then I remember this Jim Harrison quote.

>There is no self-destructiveness without the destruction of others. We are not alone."
BPD,ffx8gga,t3_evpr05,1580319930.0,"I’m 39 and relate to this a little too much. I feel like life is a carnival where you only get one ticket to ride. And I keep standing in line to get on a ride only to be enticed to leave the line by some other ride, over and over. The carnival is going to close, and I will never have gotten on any rides - rather just jumped from line to line. 

My advice to you is to pick something you’re good at and to work like hell to rationalize that choice after the fact."
BPD,ffwxyjp,t3_evjz3e,1580313528.0,"Friendly reminder not to seek/give medical advice or diagnosis. u/-Saraphina-, it seems very reasonable for you to request a professional opinion. Most people are diagnosed at around your age, but BPD is not the only condition that can account for your symptoms. Best advice is to see a psych."
BPD,ffs2jih,t1_ffrf2o6,1580171553.0,"I won't remove this, but I'd like to remind everyone to not engage in online psychiatric diagnosis and also to play nice."
BPD,ffcgnkj,t1_ffc5hao,1579799051.0,"What would be the advantage of the medical board, which is the governing body that determines disciplinary action in the event of malicious malpractice, knowing that a certain practitioner has the personality disorder formerly known as psychopathy? Probably nothing."
BPD,ffc3gze,t1_ffbyvj2,1579790607.0,"It wouldn’t necessarily get in the way if you had ASPD, but it would be nice for the licensing board to know that about you."
BPD,ff9dzxr,t3_es9npj,1579710958.0,"Tbh, this feels unlikely. A lot of what happens with pwBPD is that we have relational instability. We vacillate between extremes of idolization and devaluation. I think it’s a misconception that we devalue others to the point of no return. Instead, what happens is that we either sever or irreparably damage relationships out of impulse during times of devaluation. It’s not that we continue hating people forever. It’s that we lose the relationship and don’t ever get the opportunity to swing it back toward idolization. 

So, no, I think it would be unlikely that we’d 100% idolize someone for perpetuity - because I don’t think we 100% devalue anyone for perpetuity either. Given enough time and opportunity, there’s always a swing. 

I should note that these tendencies are treatable with therapy."
