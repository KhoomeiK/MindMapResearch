schizophrenia,fqj3cen,t3_gj2g3w,1589404485.0,"I have had schizophrenia for over 20 years and only heard voices during acute episodes. Now, I live alone for the first time in my life (I'm 43) and I hear voices almost daily. It's a very disturbing new development in my condition and I don't wish it on anyone."
schizoaffective,fqj2x8g,t3_gh01zo,1589404319.0,"I organize things very well and then get into a different mindset and either can't find the things or ask myself ""wtf was I thinking?"". This includes my home, my phone, my hobby supplies, car, purse, and my schedule lol"

bipolar,fpgwc5x,t3_gd59l1,1588610678.0,"I've lost friends while hypomania and have to apologize. Good friends understand. Bad freinds use it against me and can kick rocks.

It sucks but I think it's fairly common with mania. Lack of impulse control is the pits.

But on the upside, ive had the ""courage"" to end two bad relationships during mania."
schizoaffective,fgd5pvv,t3_exugfe,1580679178.0,I'm famous sometimes. My psychiatrist calls it grandiosity...
schizoaffective,ffiuas1,t1_ffin1ls,1579982900.0,"That's funny. I've always gotten away with deadpan humor and people who don't know me well never know that I'm joking. My freinds love it though. I never thought of that being from flat affect, maybe more my stoicism from my Scandinavian heritage. My adult son also uses deadpan humor the same way although he has no mental illness. Maybe he just picked it up from me lol"
schizoaffective,ffitu4y,t3_etqrx0,1579982567.0,"For me, I have flat effect and less or no emotional expression when I am having more positive symptoms of psychosis. When I am having less psychotic symptoms, I tend to express emotion normally, especially strong emotions of joy and sadness. When delusions hit, that goes away because then I am paralyzed with fear and my brain is occupied with all of the thoughts.

I do cry plenty. Especially during episodes of depression or when I am under stress.

I have schizoaffective bipolar type with generally more hypomania than depression. Also GAD making it all more difficult. :)"

schizoaffective,f84anxn,t3_dyxsec,1574238351.0,"This is a really hopeful post for me. I was recently diagnosed schizoaffevtive although I beleive I've suffered this for most all my life. I was in denial for years and my family supported my denial as a coping mechanism.
Now that I am coming to acceptance of my condition thanks to a wonderful Dr. and therapist, I am wanting others close to me to accept and seek to understand. Ive shared literature and tried to talk with varying success. Its disappointing when others reject your reality but it's not their fault."

almosthomeless,f7gevy0,t1_f7g7ybm,1573701934.0,"The reason she gave me was that she needed someone to live there who could ""fix up the place"". She gave me 3 weeks notice. I asked her for more time and tried to explain I was in the middle of a health crisis but she didn't seem to understand or wasn't able to allow the time. Apparently, according to my neighbor, the man she had lined up to move in, walked in and walked back out because it was in such disrepair. I had been asking her all these years to fix mild , electrical, and plumbing issues.

I was offered a temporary residence at a family members apartment unit. After the 6 month lease was up, I was told they needed the unit back.

I have had a psychiatrist and a therapist working with me on my disability insurance, my appeal, a s well as my ssdi application. My LT disability claim was closed because they could not get a hold of me by phone due to circumstances beyond my control."
bipolar,f7c9xmg,t3_dv0r8j,1573587641.0,"I have this issue also. I'm learning that it's important; for my own emotional and mental health; to find my limits and express boundaries when necessary for my health.
As people trying to manage a chronic and lifelong mental disorder, we can only give so much to others before our health suffers. I would suggest learning your limits and talking with a therapist about boundary-setting. It's not easy. I've encountered a lot of pushback from my loved ones, as well as self imposed guilt feelings. But I believe that we cannot truly be there for others if that offering is at the expense of our own health. We must self-care before we can truly care for anyone else.
I'm wishing some clarity and peace for you."
