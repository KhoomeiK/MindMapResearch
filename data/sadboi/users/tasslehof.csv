Make sure you first question to your emotion is why. And if it seems out of scale you could be misdirected.

Anxiety,fg6avip,t3_ex3bei,1580561898.0,"You are in a tailspin my dude. 

You are desperately searching for balance, your body is screaming at you something is wrong.

You just have to listen hard to it, all those unbidden thoughts are your empathic self telling you, that you need it heal to become centered.

Subconscious your friends are pushing you away because they feel you are ""beyond help"", the amount of effort required to balance you is immense and the sad truth is, you pushing people away with your fear of self, is not making it any more likley. :(

But the good news is you love yourself or you would not be here and your ""mind"", loves you because it's screaming at you to change.

Slow the fuck down, my guy. Take a breath. Then another, keep trying to string those together and everything else will come, I love you, we all do. Trust your body trust your mind it only wants you to be balanced on the side of good.

Reddit is the wrong arena for this but you seem desperately unhappy in your skin. You need to out yourself first for a bit, don't worry your life WILL NOT fall down, take a bath, watch your favourite movie, take a walk, whatever.

Then just keep doing that stuff, put yourself first and I promise your relationships will flourish.
