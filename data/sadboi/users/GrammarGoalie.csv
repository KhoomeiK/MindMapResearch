  Very hard to kill, VERY. I'm still scared of them 10+ yrs later. I can't say how many I saw at that house because it was a daily occurrence.   Nothing scares me more than those scolopendra.

I see that they also have similiar services in Florence county. Link here: 

https://scaccess.communityos.org/zf/profile/service/id/96270

Bottom line is that you deserve far better,  and no one should have to go through what you're going through.  County mental health centers can connect you with adult services & advocacy,  help find insurance & healthcare / dental services, housing coordination, personal care services, and even education and job services.  I know they can also help with transportation to your appts. It sounds like you need 3rd party intervention to extract you ASAP. It may even be possible for them to help you relocate entirely to a different part of the state to put as much distance as possible. Charleston may be a good fit. It isn't too bad socially / tolerant,  (I think of it as the liberal district of SC), and has a lot more resources here than other parts of the state,  especially MUSC, a pretty great teaching hospital and I know their dental program has really helped a few friends, and way more affordable than average dentists.

BipolarReddit,f7r8wh9,t3_dxbnju,1573976949.0,"Edit: bipolar I myself as well. Intense, prolonged manic episodes DEFINITELY wreak havoc on my brain! 

I was on lamictal and figured out it caused memory issues after having to go off it after losing insurance.  Memories from years ago returned, was able to remember things better overall, both short and long term.  Back then, I looked into it via Mayo Clinic research on side effects of medicine, and memory loss is one of them, albeit supposedly rare.

Back on lamictal now, and I'm thankful because mania itself is 100x for me, and overall, Lamictal works very well.  I think being aware of it  has made it easier for me so I can cut myself a bit of slack, and others (should) as well. For me, I get so worked up when I'm having memory issues, the anxiety of feeling ""stupid"" or ""broken"" makes it even harder to remember certain things.

Also, and hopefully this will help even more, as it did me. Bipolar has a very high rate of comorbidity, or other mental  / physical health issues that occur alongside bipolar. In my case, ADD.  I will tell you, being put on adderall was one of the best things to happen to me. I didn't get diagnosed until well into adulthood, and it's helped not only with learning difficulties, but with the memory problems as well, (memory issues are a part of ADD itself as is). There are other major physical health concerns that occur alongside bipolar, especially migraines, thyroid issues, hypertension, asthma, epilepsy.  Any of those may interfere with memory recall as well.  Being treated for hyperthyroidism should also help improve my memory and physical well-being as well.

Hope this helps.

ShitAmericansSay,f7ncmlv,t3_dvkota,1573895686.0,"American here. 

That man needs to check himself before I find him and beat whatever cancer he had right back into him. Saying ""grow up and be an adult and get insurance!"" is abhorrently insulting to people like me who cannot afford / lost health insurance through no fault of their own in a country where it's VERY DIFFICULT to afford it independently OR to find a job that will give you enough hours AND even offer it. And I'm sorry, I can't help that I'm chronically ill any more than he could have helped having cancer. 

This is the kinda shit I've had to deal with personally in regards to health insurance:

(tl;dr....'Murrica)

 Living currently in the South where they voted against expanding government assistance for healthcare, go figure. I only earned $10,000/yr, working cut hours because I was sick, and according to SC legislature, I ""earned too much"" to qualify for subsidies / assistance.  Prior to ACA, I was turned down due to pre-existing conditions. Now, ACA is supposed to ""protect"" those with pre-existing conditions. However, that doesn't stop companies from jacking up the prices, and I certainly couldn't afford the jacked up price (@$1,700/month !!) earning under $10,000/yr. And that plan didn't cover prescriptions OR mental health!   I work at a publicly funded college as a tutor where under the ACA, we'd qualify for health insurance if we work 32hrs/week, BUT they only allow us 28hrs at the most.... and this is pretty much across the board nationally at most employers. An accepted practice.

 When I lost insurance due to a divorce, I had to go off ALL MY MEDS, ranging from mental health meds to allergies/asthma/epiPens... it was the worst 3 , almost 4 years of my life.  I got very sick, and it culminated in a week in the hospital. (also could not afford the $3,000 bill....). Earlier this year, I got a second job working outside my field, (in-home elder care & hospice, which I enjoy a lot!) where I get full-time hours, plus full health coverage.  I work 44 hours/week there, 15hrs @ the college, and although I have health insurance, pay tends to be pretty low here, so I have to work almost 60hrs/week just to make rent, feed myself, put money away, and to catch up on 3+ years of bills from being seriously underemployed. 

&#x200B;

Yeah, we have great doctors, but it's not like we have a monopoly on them, lol. I   I am moving out of country soon-ish  to be with my better half, and also have the added benefit of pursuing better opportunities. Hoping to bring my skills as an educator to a country who will both appreciate and benefit from my contributions in return for a far better quality of life.
