AskReddit,fr5yuvc,t1_fr5v2h6,1589916966.0,"Nowhere does it actually mention homosexuality except leviticus, and you totally missed the point, look at my other comment with sources. There was no anti-homosexuality sentiment at the time, this was out pf the blue, a personal belief of whoever translated it, THEY changed it, not us. Sodom was reprimanded for adultery, not being gay. You can keep hanging onto your disgusting views and ignoring the true intentions of the bible and the right thing to do just because someone in the middle ages didn’t like gay people."
