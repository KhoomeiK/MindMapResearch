OCD,fnbvz9w,t3_g0plt2,1586823413.0,"When I was younger I had a lot of trouble with this, and I agree with the other response.. do what you want anyway. I used to snap and then I would obsess about it for months.. something they probably brushed off as a bad mood. I think if you dedicate your energy towards the moment, regardless of how your feeling, it will save you the heartache in the long run. For example, You wanted to write, but mom interrupted despite being informed you weren’t in the mood to talk, so now it feels like you can’t write because of that interaction. It brings unpleasant thoughts. Next time do your best to set aside your time to talk with her, putting your writing on the back burner for a few minutes and she’ll go about her way and you can go back to what you were doing separately - therefore preserving your writing energy from contamination. I hope that makes sense."
dieting,fmv5awf,t1_fffwrd6,1586406469.0,"Great job so far! I’m in a similar plateau at 170 and my goal is also 140 as well!  I used to weigh 125 but those days are over lol. I can agree that you should pick a morning only on ONE day a week to weigh. Our weight naturally fluctuates and weighing everyday or even several times a week can discourage us when the numbers don’t drop. 

I use MyFitnessPal, and I do best eating 1400 calories with exercise. Start small, a quick walk around the block to start and then do two blocks when you’re ready, then neighborhood, etc, both apple and android have a health app that will act as a pedometer so try to get up to 10,000 steps a day. (10,000 steps are assumed when you use a calorie counter, and I learned the hard way if I wasn’t doing that minimum I would either have to dramatically decrease my calorie intake or exercise a bit - I chose food LOL) eating a super low amount of calories can actually halt your weight loss and may cause you to have low blood sugar, a general feeling of low energy, and irritability. Exercise, though I was skeptical since it seems counterintuitive, has improved my energy level. 

I lost 40 pounds calorie counting in HS 165 down to 125 but now that I’m older, I find its not shedding as quickly. I’ve had to do a good bit of research into what foods to eat. Like instead of cutting carbs, eat “good” carbs like berries and other fruits. Simple things, which do take some will power and getting used to, like using the frozen zucchini noodles instead of pasta make a huge difference in calorie intake.. but in both scenarios trick my brain into thinking I had something sweet (fruits) and that I still had pasta. Seems trivial, but it’s worth a try! 

Keep pushing, but don’t push yourself too hard. Baby steps and patience, OP! You’ve got this!"

I also go through waves of taking my medicine.. the longest I took it consistently was 4 months and I felt great, like I was actually who I would be sans the OCD (although the obsessions are still there the compulsions were lessened) I got really super depressed around Christmas because I couldn’t afford my medicine and I was off it for two weeks.. I had horrible withdrawals which I just suffered through. They were truly terrible and I could hardly walk around I was so dizzy, so when I finally refilled it for some reason I now have a really hard time taking it consistently, knowing I’m going to have the withdrawal symptoms if I don’t. 😔 it’s a lifelong battle ahead and it’s overwhelming."

OCD,fm59hml,t1_fll8dar,1585768799.0,"I think it’s on a sort of case by case basis, but even though my contamination OCD is severe, I do someday want to be able to have the “typical” sexual relationship with my partner, so I think putting that as my most feared trigger gives me not only something to work up to, but also allows me think about all the triggers I’ve overcome leading up to that. If nothing bad happened then, it isn’t going to here.. that’s the idea anyway. Makes me nervous even thinking about it, but it’s a process. 

Feigning normalcy throughout my adult life, things like shaking hands and eating food that others have prepared.. I suffered silently and let it destroy me internally - sometimes rushing to the bathroom to throw up, scrub my hands, cry a bit.. and eventually avoiding social settings altogether or just refusing politely and saying “I’m not hungry” or offering a fist/elbow bump. In professional settings, a fist bump isn’t exactly welcomed and most people who don’t work in kitchens aren’t familiar with the elbow bump lol. 

Now I’m washing my hands, once, I still only accept food from friends/family I trust, so I’m still relatively at the bottom of my trigger list. I’ve cancelled therapy and other appointments until this Coronavirus situation calms down, so I’ve put new adventures on hold and honestly this quarantine has been good for me in a way, although I fear it may be counterintuitive. Keep strong, and sometimes I just have to give myself a stern talking to and say “it’s not real, it’s just the fear”"

OCD,fljdbxb,t3_fp364u,1585207725.0,"I do as well! Wow, like I’m in tears reading this post and responses because I thought it was just me.. I also avoid sexual contact because of this. To me, the stress is often misunderstood by partners and even causes them to be offended by the constant need of reassurance. I’ve been tested unnecessarily many times.. I’ve never had sex. Oral herpes is also a trigger of mine though I’ve never had it and basically would be impossible for me to get it because I don’t share drinks, kiss anyone, or even come close to other people besides family. Since the rise of COVID19, my obsessions about such are completely back and controlling me, but I know if I go to a doctor I will be obsessing about that too. 😔 Every time I shower, I think about it. If I get a wedgie, I think about it. 😅 feeling really trapped and crazy right now and it seems like nobody understands. I’ve been cussed out, blamed, and told I’m crazy for having this trigger and I literally can’t help it. I suppose how I deal with it is to just completely abstain from all contact. My partner now has been somewhat understanding until recently, saying that if us having sex wasn’t a result of my therapy he wasn’t sure if we could be together. It really hurts because I love him and I know he loves me, but to a degree I know I can’t expect him to give up a human need because of my irrational, though valid, fears. Lately I’ve been considering just having sex with him in order to save our relationship but I’m not sure what that will do to my mental state. 😔 Sorry to unload like this I’ve just never been able to talk to anyone who knows what it’s like. My therapist is helpful but having sex is on the top of my trigger list for my exposure therapy.. meaning it would be the last fear to conquer so to speak. Im on a handshake without panicking level right now.. which I’ve basically thrown out the window amidst the pandemic. I want to live a “normal” life but right now it feels like that would end my life. It would cause me to go into what I call an episode. 

Also would like to add that I have a hard time connecting with friends too. I don’t like to have friends over, but then I have to bleach all my utensils and cups and wash the couch covers 😔 clean the toilet, sanitize the sink.. I threw away an entire new pod for my vape because someone I’ve been friends with for a decade wanted to try it. It’s so hard."

It may not get better per se, as far as having the condition goes, but it is possible to manage it better. I am in exposure therapy and though it’s frustrating, scary, and hard work..

Took about 45 minutes through and through. Warning: they do grind it a bit before putting the filling so be sure to prepare yourself or make it abundantly clear you’re uncomfortable not being numbed/gassed if that’s the case. They did offer to numb me, but this happened while I was at my parents for the weekend and my mom was cooking my favorite dinner so I opted not to be numbed so I could enjoy the food 😁 it was a bit uncomfortable, but not painful.

During that period, I recall a coworker asking me why I was crying at work and I said “just got a lot on my mind” and he told me I should kill myself. He may have meant it as a joke, but since I was already considering it.. it really hurt me and pushed me closer to the edge. I transferred to another store because of it. 
The feeling when someone diminishes your VALID feelings is like a gut punch and it breaks you down further. If your relationship permits, tell her that it really hurt you that she was joking about it because it’s not something to joke about. Explain you aren’t “emotional,” but that you’re feeling. If not, do your best not to listen to her or the intrusive thoughts brought on by hearing the jokes. I let those words break me down and run me off.. try to stand strong, just for you.

I was under the impression that you ask them about that stuff. I was trying to see if there was anything OTC to help it or even just advice but the pharmacist was kind of rude, making weird faces at me like I was asking for her to donate a kidney to alleviate my discomfort, and the way she said “you’ll have to use Dramamine for that” without explaining what it was or where to even find it made me think she probably thought I was trying to get to the good shit in the back LOL. She had time to explain the HPV vaccine pamphlet nobody asked for though. So I felt kind of embarrassed after already having to explain to someone else I couldn’t fill all of it.

Do your best to enjoy your off time! I went from trazadone to lunesta to now ambien, which I find has helped the most, but it was a task to get the right medicine worked out and those dreams can make you feel like you’re going crazy.

I am having a really hard time with the withdrawal symptoms. I wasn’t even aware it could affect me like this, but it’s been 4 days since my last dose and the vertigo is so bad I can hardly walk around. 

I also have high blood pressure, thx college, so I assumed it had been high and that’s why I felt so weird, but after checking it and finding it was actually really good, I did some soul searching and realized it could be  because I just dropped from 30mg cold turkey. I have OCD and I am really wigging out as after some googling the withdrawals must be hitting me pretty hard since I discovered it usually peaks at 4-6 days. 

If anyone has had a similar experience or could offer some advice I would greatly appreciate it. I am not feeling suicidal or anything, I am safe, but it seems the more anxious I get the worse the vertigo and confusion gets and it’s just freaking me out."
