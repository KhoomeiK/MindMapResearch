We had a thriving hashish making business and we also sold some of that **THICC GROG** that was produced in our labs.

It‚Äôs a deep rooted thing when I was a child and my mom would help me study she‚Äôd hit me with a cane if I got the answers wrong. Maybe that just trickled down into anxiety in my later years"

No one is supposed to enjoy dying but we have those thoughts so much. It bring a chill down my spine and not the scared chill it the happy freeing chill.

But you know what? i'd enjoy dying more than living but i have to live. I have to live to prove to the people that made me enjoy these thoughts that i'm not useless. THAT IM NOT A WASTE OF SPACE.

depression,ewv1qkh,t3_cqb5fp,1565796719.0,"I think what people like us need ot do is throw guilt out the fucking window and muster the little energy you have to do something about your life.

We all nee to **GET UP**!"
depression,ewv1ilq,t3_cqb7j3,1565796576.0,Fuck Hope. Hope is for people who aren't sure in themselves. You know what you need to do?. You need to move and work as hard as you can so you never have to hope again. The only thing you'll be doing my friend..is knowing.

I know you dont have the energy, i know you're scared to fail, i know you have no freakin clue where to even start and i know you're still broken inside from your last defeat but warriors are the ones that survive the war and go back home to their families, even if you have to fucking crawl we have to.

depression,ews4abm,t3_cpva6a,1565719888.0,"I may not be able to properly relate. I'm 19 and in the same class as my younger sister and my younger brother one grade down despite my sister being 17 and my brother only 16. I feel useless and like a waste of space because my parents have essntially abandoned me and are try to get me out of the house as soon as possible to do a University course that i wont be able to make a career out of, so yeah i feel like my life is constantly spirally down a deep dark hole and it feels endless. sure people say ""I'm young i still have time"" no, i dont. 

I dont know what I'm going to do with myself or how to really properly relate to my family at this point. But if you ever need anyone to offload on it can be any one of us on this website (that means i'm offering just so we're clear :)) so that you can properly enjoy time with your husband without worrying him all the time. Finding new friends as well is always an option to truely find yourself. 

Spiraling down a rabbit hole doesnt have to be a void and alone. We can try to crawl out together."
depression,ews2wa9,t3_cpvasq,1565719081.0,"Your perception matters on so many levels. I cant talk or give you advice because i'm also feeling rather useless and suicidal. But i think you should try and love yourself first and not consider what other think of you. You have to live to try to be the person that YOU think you want to be and not the person your family and/or friends think you should be. 

If you still feel useless after that hit me up and maybe we could waste away together :). We're all here for you. You just have to reach out."
depression,ews2g3h,t3_cpvfkc,1565718818.0,"Hey maybe we can meet on the other side of nothingness. But think about it before you attempt to do anything again. It's a one way trip and maybe you werent meant to go the first time aye? feeling not alone is one of the greatest feelings but maybe you have to be the one to reach out to the people you love. People have their own lives, not to say that yours doesnt matter but when you reach out to people yourself instead of waiting for them to come to you, You'd be surprised how supportive people are

I dont care what age you are or your race or sexuality, but i do know this; If you go to the other side before me I'll come kill you myself.

With love, Jonathan"
depression,ews1m31,t3_cpvxi7,1565718331.0,"You have to find out why you are doing it in the first place. I've found myself in a habit of smelling my forearm and it's not hurting me but it's weird for people to look at. I did it as a child after my parents would lash out at me for not doing well in an exam or a CA test so i did it for comfort.

Find something that makes you feel calm but at the same time not self destructive, I know it's easier said than done but tyring is something"
