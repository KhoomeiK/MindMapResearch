findapath,ex2fl5p,t1_ex0xwmv,1565968550.0,That's a cool idea for a website. I'll have to take time and go through it properly. Thanks!
findapath,ex0ubbq,t1_ewzrzq2,1565922400.0,I'll look into this. Thank you.

findapath,ex0pb91,t1_ewzl0xk,1565918840.0,This is helpful. Thank you.
SuicideWatch,ewepqz2,t1_ewep1xm,1565332512.0,"What happens depends some on how suicidal you are. When I've told a dr/therapist that I wanted to kill myself, they always ask if I have a plan and if I have the means to easily carry it out. They don't want to put you in the hospital unless they think you're an immediate risk to yourself.

All of this stuff is really hard to talk about. It can help to try and remember that these people really do want to help you."
SuicideWatch,eweoc31,t3_cny78q,1565330930.0,"You don't have to be totally sure to talk about this stuff with your therapist (or your mom). Just be honest and it's their job to help you sort through it.

Do you have a good relationship with your mom? I'm sure she would much rather have a hard conversation with you and get you help than have you hurt yourself."
findapath,ewe4qgd,t1_ewe3ccm,1565314457.0,Laws vary from place to place but this is probably illegal. Even month to month tenants need notice.
SuicideWatch,ew93p40,t1_ew901a8,1565219163.0,I'm glad it did for you. I wish that were true for everyone.
SuicideWatch,ew93c4x,t3_cnct92,1565219003.0,"I'm gonna repeat a comment I've made on this subreddit before. 

I don't want to say what your brother did was right, and I'm sorry you're hurting. 

I've thought about this a lot, because I've been dealing with suicidal impulses for more than a decade now. I do know that people would grieve for me, and...Yes, that's sad. I don't want that to happen.

Have you ever heard the metaphor of suicide being like jumping out of a burning building? That is how I feel. Like I'm living with these flames, and while jumping is a choice that I have, it's hard to explain the terror and pain of not jumping to someone whose house has never been on fire. It isn't that I won't feel guilty, it's that maybe someday I won't be able to take that pain anymore. I hope those around me can forgive me if that happens. 

I do hope you can find some peace."
SuicideWatch,ew8tyrr,t3_cnc7gb,1565215128.0,I think it's just human nature. You and I are here because a very very long line of our ancestors lived at least long enough to reproduce. Everything in your body will struggle to keep you alive until it can't anymore.
SuicideWatch,ew8qq1u,t3_cnbchu,1565213726.0,"You could call their apartment complex- I'd be honest but don't mention suicide, just say you haven't heard from your friend and that's unusual. Probably an apt manager would go knock on their door, but you can't be totally sure they won't call the cops."
depression,eqghiyv,t1_eqfu8s3,1560036485.0,I read a lot. Or watch Netflix. Sometimes I read while watching Netflix to be extra removed from reality.

Fucked if you do and fucked if you don't, I guess?"
