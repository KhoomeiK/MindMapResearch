relationship_advice,fnhd13z,t1_fnhalsq,1586960050.0,"Yes, she has shown strong fear of abandonment and she never wants to be alone. The second one yes, she  blames someone for all her problems. The time I knew her she rarely ever said anything was her fault. She played the victim card a lot and had a lot of fallings out with past friends not just me. The third one she has outbursts and tantrums with close loved ones. I have never seen her do it front of strangers or acquaintances. The fourth one yes, she would flip quickly. She would love her bf one second then hate him the next. She would do this with friends as well. She would like them one second and dislike them the next. She also super sweet and caring. Then she would do some really fucked up things to people. It’s getting worse as she gets older."
