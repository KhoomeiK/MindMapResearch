depression_help,fk83csf,t3_dhdgjm,1583948585.0,"Hi virgilreality... you have definately found a very powerful technique to interrupting the cycle of Automatic Negative Thoughts of depression. I had depression for 37 years and did something remarkably similar to get rid of depression. I have a BA in psych and did research to reverse engineer what I did. It is in the subset of Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy called Behaviorial Activation. The late Dr. Neil S. Jacobson published his research on this and it is referenced on pages 55-56 of Dr. Stephen S. Ilardi's book called The Depression Cure. I detail a slightly different version in my blog called ""the POWER TRIP"" on my website [www.depressiveswar.com](https://www.depressiveswar.com)Great work, my friend! keep spreading the good work!!!"
depression_help,f3q9ovk,t3_dhdgjm,1571071653.0,"In a nutshell, this is how I did it: I'd give myself permission to leave my anxieties and negetive thoughts for a few minutes while I went for a run. 

While running, I say OUT LOUD ""I am in control of  _________"" and I'd give myself a tiny task and execute it immediately, like pushing up my sleeve. 

I'd do this for about 10-15 minutes. All different tasks. No repetition. 

This engages a bunch of areas in your brain and it's too busy to keep the depresssive thoughts floating around too. 

There are a bunch of benefits to this exercise, including getting your prefrontal cortex in touch with reality. The automatic negative thoughts are not based in reality and the pfc loses some ability to discern. 

The big thing is creating a too that forces the depressive thoughts OUT. Passive things like drinki g with friends, or driving listening to music are all  passive and you have to rely on an external thing to take away your depression. It's being able to force your depression out at your will that is so very critical and kudos to you for finding a way!!!!

In a few weeks, I am launching my new website www dot depressiveswar dot com. It will go in to detail. Hope to see you there.

But, your grades are not WHO you are. Your depression is not WHO you are. You are a vibrant, sophisticated, productive person temporaily bogged down by how your brain processes life events and situations. We depressives ruminate and bully ouselves reflexively. 

It's possible to stop the reflexive bullying. It's absolutely no different than being bullied in school- there is NEVER an acceptable reason to be bullied by another student. Same in our case- there is one area of the brain that is hyperactive with bullying. But since it's all inside our brain the bullying has a credibility we would not give to a it otherwise. 

There are ways to make the automatic negative thoughts and bullying stop. 

Keep at it!!!"

A lot of us depressives have been led to believe that our depression is due to some fault or shortcoming on our part, we don't want to go through the ""brainwashing"" process of reprogramming our personalities it ""correct our flaw"",  and we therefore resist treatments. It's terrifying to think the only answer is to entirely de-construct and re-construct our self. Especially if we've been in the same therapy for years and it hasn't worked; the dread of doing the ""real"" work is overwhelming.

Really, depression is caused by the WAY our brains process information and life events, it's not WHO we are. There is no ""re-construction"" of a person that is necessary. There is only the need to stop the automatic negative rumination. It's possible."

Once I stopped destroying myself AND as a post-depressive I could see the bull-shit of the nonsense my depressive brain created (like ""I can never make it on my own; iam such a loser; i don't deserve a happy life"") 
I up and left my ogre-narcissist husband thT had bled me dry of my life savings, my time, and my talent due to caterin to his every outlandish need for a decade (""ya, I know the car payment is due but I NEED another new set of tires for my Harley because I've worn through these because I don't work and all I have to do is race up and down the local mountains all day and you know I don't work because you have such pathetic income from your 3 jobs combined that you have to rely on me THREE OR FOUR times a month to pick up your pain in  the ass kids!!!"") So I literally left him early one morning before he even woke up. He'd moved us out of state to isolate me from my kids and family and lost his control with his anger in new ways and flat out told me he wanted to start hitting me. 

Anyway, without the depression, I could think according to the real world, and I could trust my ability to keep my ""self"" intact as I drove across the state line with NOTHING but a few files and photos in my back seat. 

I now have a better full time job, my family is back in my life, I am a local high school cross country coach getting to knww 50+ amazing young student athletes in my JV group, and I have purchased the domain name to start my anti-depression website to help others do what I did and ditch the depression. I found the loving, kind, supporting, handsome man I always hoped to be with. He's stepped up to love support my kids as if they were his own, but gives their bio dad room and respect.

depression,f1lixs8,t3_d9tqae,1569556093.0,"The key is to GET YOUR CONTROL BACK, and do it *right now*.

1)  tell yourself you have permission to ""step away"" from the torment for a few minutes. You don't have an obligation to entertain the bombarding negativity. 

2) get outside for a walk or light jog if you can. Speed is not important. Movement is.

3) OUT LOUD say ""I am in control of.....  "". And follow up with the small action. For example, ""I am in control of transfering the nickel in my left pocket to my right pocket"". Then do it. ""I am in control of pushing up my right sleeve."" Then do it. ""I am in control of walking three steps on the very edge of the sidewalk."" Then do it. ""I am on control of  ...... "" 

Do this for about 10 minutes or so. All different little tasks SAID  OUT LOUD.

Why this works:

You will be engaging so many areas of the brain that there won't be enough brain power to produce the Reflexive Negative Thoughts that flood our head and hijack our brain. In other words you brain will be TOO BUSY to produce the Negative Thoughts for the few minutes you are doing this. You will be using your balance and motor skills areas of your brain to walk or jog, creative areas to come up with all the different tasks,  speech area to say out loud, and hearing area to listen to execute. The key is to make your brain so busy doing all these things, it is not able to also maintain producing the tormenting Reflexive Negative Thoughts.

You will teach your brain what you REALLY are in control of. Our depressive heads produce self-bullying garbage like ""I don't deserve a nice life"" and ""I'm a loser"". That becomes a sort of reality- proving or disproving pure bullshit that is not provable or dis-provable; it's all subjective opinion. You can't *prove* ""loser"". There is no official list of ""loser"" qualities. It's all subjective. But our poor logic center ends up spending way way way too much time and effort manipulating the bullshit and legitimizing the negative thoughts.

When you say out loud a simple task and complete it, there is nothing about it that your brain can contest or argue about. If you try to ""have positive self-talk"" in the middle of a depressive episode, it can really back fire because the Reflexive Negative Statements will piss all over anything subjectively nice you have to say to yourself.  Then you feel worse and you escalate the war. A neutral action like ""I am in control of tying my laces with two rabbit ears"" is something your brain will just do, not argue over. 

You will learn to discipline your brain into peace when YOU WANT TO if you regularly do this control exercise. I did itEVERY DAY and got rid of my depression after 37 years. I had done everything else: eating well, exercise, SSRIs therapy, all of it.

It's a HUGE ADVANTAGE to have the ability to PUSH THE DEPRESSIVE'S WAR OUT OF YOUR BRAIN AT YOUR WILL. No hoping for the distraction to make you forget, no need to drink to forget, no dangerous stunt like going for a drive and hoping busy traffic will dry your sobbing tears.

The Reflexive Negative Statements are a form.of self-bullying (""I suck as a person"", ""I'm a loser"", ""nobody actually likes me, they're just being polite"" etc.) It's all bullying. 

The front of your head, the prefrontal cortex, is the self-preservation center, but all it has is logic. LOGIC IS NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST A BULLY. You don't counter a playground bully with logic. The bully has no evidence, no absolute truth- the bully just has opinions and it's really a weak argument if you put it in a setting, say, of a court of law where a thousand actual FACTS are presented. 

So our poor prefrontal cortex just keeps trying to ""win"" the arguments against the Reflexive Negative Statements. And often two things happen:

1) the prefrontal cortex's line of logic gets bastardized beyond recognition. It somehow contrives evidence for our overall uslessness or our being ""undeserving"" otr other swlf-destructive thought. But it's no loner true logic, it appeasement that our prefrontal cortex morphs into. 

2) the prefrontal cortex gets exhausted in endless warring against the Reflexive Negative Statements. That's when the positive self-talk is labled ""hokey"" and dismissed. The prefrontal cortex is too tired to fight on behalf of the positivity. It's easier to dismiss it and let the Reflexive Negativity run wild, like unruly toddlers and an exhausted parent. 

(Ya, I got arounf all that, btw. Got rid of ny depression entirely. Now IF, by old habit a stray Reflaxive Negative Statement come up when I have a stressful setback in life, my prefrontal cortex actually fireback ""BULLSHIT"" and stops it almost befor it starts and I can use my prefrontal cortex for real-world logic.)"

AskReddit,eyliw5j,t1_eykqelt,1567185516.0,"Commenting on the replies below regarding preventing relaps:  ""going for a walk"" is fantastic. CBT also has merit. 

I did a hybrid of the 2, and it ended up curing my depression. I would go for a walk (in my case, a run) and do the following:
1) give yourself permission to step away from the anxiety or depression for a short while; I'd tell myself it wiuld not change while I was out and I could pick it back up if I wanted to. 
2) Create a small task. Say it OUT LOUD in the form of ""I am incontrol of ___________"" and immediately execute the task. Create another, different one. Say out loud. Execute.
4) Engage your prefrontal cortex to create all different little tasks. Repetition creates bordom and the ANTs and anxiety can creep back in before you allow it to. 
3) Expect to hold this concentration for about 10-15 minutes.

Why it works/why CBT does not seem to work for some:

When your body is moving, like walking or running, there are several motor cortex areas of your brain engages. Some of this actio. Is autonomic and tequire no conscious processing, and some part does, like navigating around a puddle, but it is so minor it does not take much brain processing power. When you think of your task, your prefrontal cortex is active and engaged. When you say it out loud, your speech center is engaged, when you hear your task, your hearing center is engaged. With all these areas of the brain engaged, your brain is too occupied and busy to keep the atmosphere of Automatic Negative Thpughts of depression or the the re-play circuits of your anxieties. 

When you learn to force a cease-fire of the war and turbulance in your brain, you start winning the war that depression causes. Depression causes relentless self-bullyi g and self-ravaging. When you consciously creat peace, even for a few minutes, you have a powerful tool. Distractions, like listening to music or driving are passive methods of trying to relieve the depressive ANTs, and sometimes even traffic conditions are so mundane and routine that the distraction isn't enough. Sometimes CBT, using logic, can't combat the trains of subjective bullying of the depressive self-destructive thoughts. 

By saying ""I am in CONTROL OF.... "" you help your prefrontal cortex get back in touch with reality. For so long, our PFCs have tried to combat nonsense bullying statements of ""I am worthless"" and ""I am a loser"". There is no logic to counter these objective lables of self-destruction. There is no control over these statements. The terrifying part of depression comes when you have NO SAFE PLACE IN YOUR OWN HEAD. 

So, create a safe place. ""I am in control of taking 3 steps on the right sild of the sidewalk"". And do it. ""I am in control of transferring the dime in my right pocket over to my left pocket"". I am in control of pushing up my sleeve half way up my forearm"".

It takes about 10 hours (according for one TED speaker) for the neurons that fire together, to wire together. One 15 minute session of this was not my cure. I did this daily, like an athlete thaat trains for a sporting event. 

I hope, in all sincerity, that you are able to conquer the depression."
AskReddit,eylfe4g,t3_cxfmh8,1567183218.0,"I DON'T HAVE TO; my brain (prefrontal cortex part) now calls BS on the Automatic Negative Thoughts on the rare occasions they pop up. Extinquishes them immediately so the depressive episode never develops. 

PFC no longer allows ANT's = no depression.

You read that right. 

Mind you, I dedicated weeks to 10-15 minutes almost every day to balancing my brain habits to make the Automatic Negative Thoughts stop from their source. 

It's not that I am now emotionless and robotic, I just don't have the ANT's hijacking my brain and turning into my own private war hell of a selfz-torture chamber. 

Now my PFC (prefrontal cortex) is available to do its job of countering stess, anxiety and disappointment with sensible logic, and sure a setback can be a bummer, but it doesn't trigger the self-bullying.

When you brain just automatically starts flooding itself with ""I'm a loser"", ""I'm wothless"", ""nobody actually likes me"", etc., it's all bullying. There is no logic that can shut down bullying, because bullying is an infliction of subjective criticism. Logicic is (should be) rooted in objective lines of thought.

For a depressive, this self-bullying is inescapable because our self-defense from our PFC does not have the right ammunition, it only has logic, and more rational thought. 

But, our poor PFC gets all caught up in twisted and contorted lines of ""reasoning"" in attempts to counter the bullying. So, depressives can develop this skewed sense of self, and an odd view of what they are truly capable of in this world. Their PFC's are chronically exhausted from the futile fight against the bullying antagonism. 

Anyway, I stopped the ANTs. And I am depression free, after 37 years of warring in my head. Moving on with who I REALLY am."
depression,eyj598l,t3_cwywak,1567112759.0,"For years I was the same way. I had been a depressive for about 27 years by age 35. I HATED sex, married to move out of the house and start ""adulting"" (cuz there was no way my depressive self could keep it together well enough to survive on mh own, and my parent wouldnt tolerate me in their house indef). 

I would have done the same thing. Was done reproducing. Would have had all the parts hacked off or sliced out and joined a nunnery if not for raising my kids. (I adore my childen and they are turning out to be enjpy able adults and productive members of sociery.)

Well fast forward to now. I am 5 years post depressive. (No, no credit to the fluoxitine or the 5 or 6 different therapists, sorry medical community). 

I have a great life now. My sexuality is a private part of my life, but it is important. I would've have it any other way. 

The you that could exist in a post-depressive or non-depressive state might be normal. 

I wondered for years why I was ""locked out"" of the rest of the world who actually liked sex, displayed sexual parts, or even enhanced them. It repulsed me. But, it was an unfortunate expression of the self-hate of depression. 

Please don't be hard on yourself about your anatomy. Some day you might find that having your parts and being at peace with them is a part of who you are. Good luck, most sincerely."

Sitting at a desk- I start getting drowsy. If I am at home and lay down to take a nap, I'm am unable to actually sleep. So I get up and go back to the desk, and 20 min later, my eyelids are drooping again. Stupid cycle. 

So, I work in a big busy warehouse. Have a bachelor's degree and I push carts and stock dog food. My parents were severely disappointed that I didn't continue on the ""promising corporate office"" career I started in college. I just couldn't stay awake at my desk. I'd get up and walk around and come back and struggle with narcolepsy. I had a really hard time in high school and college classes too. So, I chose a company with ""high activity"" jobs. 

It's all fine and dandy for now, but I need to plan for the future. I don't think it's prudent for me to assume, as a 112 pound, 50 year old woman, that I can stock 55 pound sacks of dog food, big boxes of detergent, cases of soda, or push lines of 10+ shopping baskets until I retire in 15-20 years. I honestly don't think it's real to expect that of my body.

depression,exf7mvd,t1_evhalq0,1566234511.0,"Sorry Burt, I got this message one day when I was at work. I work FT and train and coach cross country. 

From 1977 to 2015 I had depression. The last ten years I had professional help. I was on very low dose SSRI's (i got jittery and had side effects with more), and I was still having really bad episodes. 

Because I was a depressive, making decisions with low self-esteem, I got into a relationship with a high-demand narcissist. He used all of my life savings, ran up my credit, monitored my every minute, and was constantly threatening the end of our relationship if I so much as didn't hand over 95% of my $23 8n tip money for the night with the exactly correct look of adoration and genuine pleasure on my face, knowing full well I was dead broke, had no gas, little food for my kids, and he was go8ng to spend it the next day riding his motorcycle all day, since I was his sugar mama and he didn't  work. If moved out, I'd be on the street semi-homeless and I'd l9se custody of my boys. So, I sucked it up. I just describe my situation because if I could do it in that nightmare, a plush, nurturing set of friends/fam, other saftey and stability is not a requirement. 

I was ""given permission"" to go out running (jogging)  alone by the ogre narcissist, so I would. I got creative during these runs. (Rhis mental benefit of running is detailed 8n a book I just listen to called Running is my Therapy by Scott Douglas). 

I identified that being plagued by Automatic Negative Thoughts was my biggest problem as a deptessive, because in these times, I felt as if I had zero control in my existance, and no safe place to be, no even in my own head. The ANTs would desimate my sole and psyche while just the stuff of life would drain every material resource I had. 

So I decided, after 6 or 7 therapists, skin rashes from Welbutrin, and jittery limbs on Prozac, that I needed to create a safe place in my head but my own method.

So I did. 

Some days, went on runs that were 100% focused on declaring gratitude. I'd just create gratitude where there was none just a minute before. Even if the thought was a seemingly trite as ""the blister on my toe healed and my left foot is pain free today!"" I took the 20 minute run to just exist in gratitude. 

Another thing I did regularly was to announce to myself what I was in control of. I would be out running and I'd say PUT LOUD ""I am in control of taking three strides on the left side of the sidewalk"" and I'd immediately do it. ""I am in control of transfering my phone from my right hand to my left hand"" and I'd immediately do it. 

Either of these routines would last 8-12 minutes, I guess. I didn't time them. 

The critical thing with both is that YOU PUSH THE ANXIETY AND ANTs OUT OF YOUR HEAD YOURSELF. You don't passively wait for a distraction to pull your focus elsewhere. In my two routines, you take ownership of what is going on in your head. 

I was just figuring that after 37 years, my brain needed a break from the anxieties and ANTs of depression. 

What happened though, is that I have been 100% FREE FROM ANTs for the last 4 years. If an old brain habit kicks in and and ANT pops up, my prefrontal cortex will literally call bullshit on the thought and it will vanish like smoke. (Like my old ""I am so stupid"" ANT that was a depressive thought that would pop up in my head, and then the rentless stream of self-bullying that ensued). 

I am no longer a depressive. My ""old brain"" no longer creates the ANTs because my prefrontal cortex does not tolerate them. Period. Anxieties? Sure, but they don't completely hijack my head and morph into a depressive episode like they would. 

I am learning to live as a normal person now. It's amazing. Full of hope. Wonderful. 

I ditched the ogre narcissist literally overnight in 2016. He had moved us out of state, away from my kids anyway. He had no idea I had it in my and he was left high and dry. Hahahahh. I am back with my boys, with an amazing, loving supportive man who provides for the household properly. He's the love of my life. My story of depression has a happy ending."

To counter the lack of control, I created a tiny world of control. I would (and I still do this now) focus on telling myself out loud what I  am unarguably in control of, like tying my shoe laces. ""I am in control of tugging on the laces to adjust the fit."" ""I am in control of picking up each side and forming loops.""

science,es0kwxc,t1_erzq5d0,1561477617.0," I am not sure why the other comments were removed. This is a big sub and this anser is NOT official science, although not pure conjecture. I developed D at a very young age and this was before much social interference. The ""back"" of my head (LS area) produced the ANTs, and the ""front"" veinly tried to produce logic to cancel the negativity of the ANTs. I later lerned that the ""front"" is indeed the center of logic and reasoning, the PFC. I lived in the battles of this conflict for 37 ensuing years. By age 45, I was barely treading water in life and was in a ""sink or swim"" point. So I decided to get out of the D. I narrowed the big problem down to my utter lack of conscious control in my head when the ANTs hijacked my head. So, I created a method of creating 100% control, foolproofly. I was, and am still, a runner. So I did this while running, but another activity could do, like gardening, folding laundry. I said OUT LOUD ""I am in control of...."" and I would announce a micro-task and execute it immediately. ""I am in control of taking 3 strides close to the left of the trail."" ""I am in control of clearing over these next to cracks in the sidewalk."" ""I am in control of tapping the top leaf of this bush as I pass."" A different task, on after another, said out loud, for 8-10 minutes. Total 10 hours or so of specific practice to wire (or re-wire) the neurons. Done exactly this way, your brain is busy enough to not have the capacity to keep the ANTs and depressive thought habits in your head while your mouth is announcing the task, your auditory areas are processing hearing the task, you are executing the task, and your PFC is busy creating the next task. 1) you actively push the D out of your head at your will and that is a mighty powerful tool 2) you make your PFC aware of what it controls in the real world, reducing some usless need to fight the drivel of the ANTs and once the PFC has that power to ""call BS"" on the ANTs, they stop. Once the ANTs stop, your whole brain is available to put its processing power back into actually guiding your life instead of having your life steered by your depression."

(I banged my head into the ground in fron of a police officer, and left forehead holes in drywall in fron of others because I had no control over this self-harm reflex back in the day.)
I am here in this group to say that our brains are NOT necessarily condemned to a life sentence of depression. There is no magic in what I did. One of my original factors- an early on-set of tinnitus at age 3 or 4- is very much still present in my head. But, the depression is not. I very much feel for you."

I have my own experience- noting how it developed in my own head with distinct warring sections of the front and back of my head. I know how I specifically practiced a routine of countermeasure every day, a routine which I developed on my own. I know I DO NOT have depression any more now, but I did have it from 1977 to 2015. I know that what I read of recent, credible, publications have meshed with my theories."

I'd go back to school for a master's in some sort of brain science if I could.

depression_help,ernarv0,t3_c2rk3o,1561048501.0,"The most misuderstood thing about depression is that it is the WAY our brains process a situation, and it is not WHAT the event was. A depressive could be standing in a beautiful meadow and have a butterfly land on them, and sink into a depressive episode from the guilt of having no nectar to supply the butterfy with, and appologize to said insect for wasting it's time. 

The learned helplessness factor is also a huge influence. Page 371 of Dr. Seligmang's book The Hope Circuit gives a good rundown on the DRN, related structures and release of 5-HT. 

There are multiple parts of the brain that are actively involved in a depressive. The Automatic Negative Thoughts of the area of the Limbic System and upper brain stem (location of DRN) and the PFC. These two areas are at war, and our consciousness is caught in the crossfire between, leaving no ""safe place"" for our consciousness to be in our own heads."

Depression and anxiety are the result of  HOW your brain processes life events and reactions. 

The hard part for we depressives is that we can't get a break from our own brains, so ya, it plagues us at all times and in all ways. 

Different therapists have different approaches. If one doesn't seem seem to be a good connection for you, it is fair game to try another one if you want."
depression_help,erkkyo4,t3_c2dp1n,1560965745.0,"An incredible difficult thing for we depressives is the chronic bullying we get from our own heads. The thing is that this bullying comes in the form of very subjective ""arguments"". If it tells you that you are a ""loser"" a huge problem in this for our rational, cognitive side, is that there is no defination for ""loser"". There is simply a different list for every person on this planet that can discribe his or her ""loser"" qualities. Therefore, our poor prefrontal cortexes get caught up in this never-ending, no-win situation. The problem is NOT that you are truly, in real life, an all around ""loser"", the problem is that type of bullying tactics that depressive part of your brain is using."

depression_help,erhpkck,t3_c24hdi,1560880118.0,AWESOME. I am so glad to offer that tool to you.
depression_help,erho0az,t3_c24hdi,1560879178.0,"Yes, continue your walks. I am not ""telling you what to do"" here, but this is what I did to claim a few minutes of peace:
1) go out for a walk or light jog, like you have been.
2) say OUT LOUD ""I am in control of...."" Say a small action and immediately execute it. For example ""I am in control of stepping over little this rock with my left foot"". And immediately do it. ""I am in control of touching that leaf on the bush as I pass"". And immediately do it. ""I am in control of taking 3 extra short steps in a row"" And immediately do it. You HAVE TO SAY IT OUT LOUD in order to have the full immersion, othewise your brain habits will have the anxiety flood back in at any chance it gets. 
3) Be creative and come up with a bunch of different little actions to do. Being creative helps keep your mind busy so as to not leave room in your head for anxiety for a few minutes. Being creative keeps you from repeating tasks. If you start repeating the same action, your brain will get bored and the anxiety will flood back in. 
I would be able to get a good 10-12 minutes of relief doing this. Good luck."

depression_help,erdk1xz,t3_c1gsht,1560744730.0,"In my recent years, but while I was still a depressive, I had these downs as well. PMS is well known to do this to us. I tried to figure out why. What would be the advantage in the survival of our early hominid ancestors? I finally settled on the concept that my body was letting me know of it's disappointment of NOT getting pregnant. My body knows nothing my relationship status, or my financial sutuation. My body just knows it has a duty to perpetuate the species. It was like my body was ""punishing"" me emotionally for missing another opportunity to have a baby. Professional anthropologists might dissagree. But since ""mood swings"" come with the PMS, there has to be a reason. It's just that ""mood swings"" in we depressives can be a hundred million times more horrible compared to non-depressives."
depression_help,er5lzt8,t3_c0l2li,1560528774.0,"Your depression is because of the WAY your brain processes situatuions, not WHAT it is presented to process. It is the path the info takes within your brain, not the info itself. We are taught to look at external sources of the problem in our society, and so many of us grow up believing in the habit of blaming, and that blaming will fix it. No. It does not. It may bring a flash of pleasure, but it does not end the depression."

depression,eq7spdu,t1_eq7i6km,1559852564.0,"To add to the constructive feedback: 

The problem with this vein of depression is that the conscious part of our heads has become so caught up with the nonsense of the negative thoughts. It loses its perspective. 

Define ""ugly"": __________. You CAN'T. ""Ugly"" is a not a fact, it is a subjective description. A fact is to say something is wet, for example. That is provable. Everyone's discription of ""ugly"" is different, so you can give some subjective evidence for ""ugly"", but are no rules to ""ugly"", like the way ""if it has water on it or soaking it, it is wet"". Conversely, there is not a case to have an exclusion of ""not ugly"". If something is not wet, it is dry. But there are NO rules or definations for ""ugly"" or ""NOT ugly"". 

The way depression screws with our heads is that it takes ""ugly"" and an so relently saps the strength of our conscious logic, that our conscious thows in the towel and appeases the negative talk. ""Ok, sure, in my negative thought's agrument for ""ugly"" I can't come up with a bulletproof defense, so I will concede that ""ugly"" is true. 

But in the world outside our depressive heads, logic does NOT work like that. Depression basterdizes and corrupts our logic."
