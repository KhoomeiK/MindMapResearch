Unfortunately that conclusion is long, long forgone and here we are. The article is a little misleading in saying that you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt quit your job‚Äù over the virus. You absolutely still can - just don‚Äôt expect unemployment to be paid out to you in that case. I believe quitting your job has almost always been a reason unemployment is denied anyway."
OhioMarijuana,fpwaiwr,t1_fpw0xhk,1588960061.0,"Yep Verilife outsources phone answering and then the specific  dispensary will call you back if you need to ask them a question or order.

I know for a fact they fired two people recently because I‚Äôm friends with them, so this is directly their fault. Thankfully I have a very nice caregiver who will go for me, but it makes me worried for her safety every time. I used to be a big fan of verdant cinci and I can say for sure now it‚Äôs a total shit show. They don‚Äôt provide their employees any hand sanitizer, masks or gloves. I‚Äôm not 100% sure about the other ones in my area on employee safety but it gets me riled
Up that the governor is allowing curbside but basically no one is doing it. I even asked the question here not long about places that were actually doing curbside and had someone telling me ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not that easy for them to do it‚Äù. Ok.

He did say he would reach out to his contacts at ODJFS to see if he could get any sort of response on it. I haven‚Äôt heard anything back yet and followed up with him in email today.

I wipe down any grocery/delivery item in my garage before bringing it in my house. I don‚Äôt trust that it‚Äôs safe not to do those things - we were also told that ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt do anything‚Äù and now being told that wearing masks is pretty much mandatory."
Covid19_Ohio,fo45l7o,t3_g5j65k,1587498579.0,Are there any polls out there on how many folks in Ohio even feel safe going back to work/going out in a gradually increasing captivity? I haven‚Äôt left my house in ~37 days and I certainly don‚Äôt feel safe going out when there are people in my community who I know don‚Äôt wear masks/gloves/keep their distance. I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôm the only one.
Covid19_Ohio,fo3zn2z,t1_fo0e7ki,1587495669.0,"Yeah that‚Äôs especially concerning to me. It just seems like he‚Äôs bending to pressure to start reopening before it‚Äôs really safe to do so. I don‚Äôt trust that we aren‚Äôt gonna have to shut down again in 3-5 weeks when we find out either whatever mitigation strategies we are using aren‚Äôt working or that people aren‚Äôt following them, likely a mixture of both unfortunately."
Covid19_Ohio,fo3ze64,t1_fo3lutj,1587495551.0,Same situation. Applied almost 5 weeks ago and all my claims are pending. I‚Äôve answered all the questions they‚Äôve sent me and I haven‚Äôt heard anything.
FTM_SELFIES,fo3i3wi,t3_g4d6l2,1587487280.0,"If anyone wants to continue making rude comments to OP, you can consider yourself banned."
Covid19_Ohio,fo0ngxt,t1_fo0gu69,1587416291.0,Same boat here. I‚Äôve been waiting a month and all my claims are still pending. I‚Äôm getting antsy. I know they are way overburdened but I think a month without any income is a long time to wait and impossible for a lot of people.
Covid19_Ohio,fo0n3mv,t1_fo0k57t,1587416097.0,Yeah this guy has been on a tirade about education for a few days. As a son of a teacher in Ohio - I‚Äôm very glad schools are staying closed. My mom is a high risk individual and I don‚Äôt want her to get sick and die because of her job.
Coronavirus,fnym9fb,t1_fny6ew4,1587367591.0,Yep. Planning on starting to reopen shit on May 1. He‚Äôs openly admitting we don‚Äôt have enough tests but apparently for some reason reopening is gonna be just fine. Right.
politics,fny3639,t3_g4adda,1587352278.0,How about we not start reopening Ohio before we have the testing capacity to do so safely? I agree with almost everything else Dewine has done in this crisis but his talk of trying to reopen May 1 is just stupid.
MMJ,fnwt6yl,t3_g4aeu2,1587324962.0,"Very interested in the comments on this one. I‚Äôve thought of doing the same thing, and I also have a low tolerance for edibles. I would say 3-5mgs is also the sweet spot for me. Making my own with RSO seemed like an easy way (in my mind) to get way too stoned so I‚Äôve just been buying packs of pre-dosed gummies and cutting them into the doses I can handle. In Ohio, a pack of 10-11 gummies is $45, but I can turn that into like 35-40 doses for myself so it‚Äôs worth the cost."
Coronavirus,fntxoq0,t1_fns9get,1587250589.0,An Olympic barbell for $400? Yikes. I bought mine for $150 I believe. Had it for several years.
COVID19,fntbion,t1_fnt2ccy,1587238358.0,Because it‚Äôs not that easy. There are people coming to the hospital who don‚Äôt even know they have covid due to being asymptomatic and they‚Äôre shedding virus. It‚Äôs not containable that way. You can‚Äôt tell people on one end of the county that they need to travel all the way to the other end of the county if they have covid and can‚Äôt breathe. They need immediate attention and it‚Äôs not feasible to travel that far with a critically ill patient. You won‚Äôt stop people from coming in off the street to the ER to be seen for viral symptoms. It‚Äôs impossible.
politics,fnt81du,t3_g3p6if,1587236399.0,Tell that to the state of Ohio who is saying we are going to start opening shit on May 1st. Can you say - hello second wave?
AmItheAsshole,fnt3r0b,t3_g3keje,1587234042.0,"I‚Äôm gonna go against the grain here and say NTA, and the fact that she flipped out over such a trivial thing is a red flag. Honestly I‚Äôm imagining myself in this situation - if my husband had a secret room where there wasn‚Äôt really anything creepy in it, and he suddenly showed it to me...I‚Äôd probably just be excited. I might question why it was a secret but there‚Äôs no reason to freak out. I‚Äôve been with my husband for a decade, for reference. Maybe we are just further along in our relationship than other people and realize that a lot of fights are just based on overreactions on someone‚Äôs part."
costochondritis,fnspaul,t1_fnrullq,1587226199.0,Usually for me it feels like just really sore. If I turn or move I can feel a dull pain. It sometimes feels like it‚Äôs making it harder to expand my lungs. Pinching/stabbing is usually how people describe nerve pain.
costochondritis,fnsp5mv,t1_fnrp5c9,1587226118.0,It happens by itself sometimes for me. It happens a lot less now that I‚Äôm a few years into it - it used to happen all the time in the beginning. It‚Äôs settled down a bit now so maybe that will happen for you too.
costochondritis,fnr26ww,t3_g3fp8r,1587177514.0,Yes - source: I‚Äôve had this problem for 6 years.
Covid19_Ohio,fnqhimx,t3_g3apz5,1587164721.0,I applied a month ago and all my claims are still ‚Äúpending‚Äù.
OhioMarijuana,fnn04jm,t1_fnm5i2b,1587081607.0,"I haven‚Äôt heard of any dispensaries closing, at least not close to me, but as you know I‚Äôm with you on delivery. It‚Äôs so frustrating that now people who want to buy their medicine all at once (90 days) are gonna be forced to go back TWICE during a pandemic. Also the verdant near me isn‚Äôt doing curbside delivery at all like their email said they were going to. I sent my husbands other caregiver over there yesterday and she had to go inside and wait. So effectively no dispensary in cinci is doing curbside and hardly no one I know wants to go wait inside someplace right now - rightfully so."
Covid19_Ohio,fnmiyua,t1_fnm7m2u,1587072272.0,"Yeah this part isnt clear at all. Are we starting to open on May 1 (which would mean that this would likely be a part of those other states plans as well) or what are we doing? From what I understand, hospital capacity is doing ok but nothing else has changed. We don‚Äôt have solid testing in place, we don‚Äôt have contact tracing, which I know they said they‚Äôre working on but..2-3 weeks from reopening what‚Äôs stopping a second wave? It doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to say ok well our social distancing/stay at home has worked so we can allow people to go back out now. I‚Äôm not really reassured by what‚Äôs happening out there. I realize it‚Äôs very hard on people to be out of work but Is it really better to be put back to work and at risk of getting critically ill or dying? Ofc this also comes down to the fact that unemployment is ridiculously slow and there aren‚Äôt enough social programs/funds being rolled out quick enough to actually help people."
