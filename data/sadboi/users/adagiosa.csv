So we went a couple years without speaking even though he was supposed to see his kid. He just...didnt care to I guess. Didn't pay child support either. It wasn't until this past summer when we finally talked. He's changed, he's good to his girlfriend and their baby and wants to see our daughter regularly now. We even finally got our old friendship back. I think honestly we were just toxic together and combine that with ptsd from two tours in Afghanistan, it was a poisonous mix.

AskReddit,fr0e5t9,t3_gln8tu,1589792418.0,"Started by feeling super fatigue and just general blegh. Then the dry cough and burning lungs, kind of like if you breathe in a toxic chemical. It also almost felt like my lungs were cramping slightly. Then a 102 fever with chills and hot flashes. The worst was the dizziness, almost spinning room like when you've had too much to drink. My legs were so wobbly. I barely had the strength to change the baby's diaper; my poor 4 year old learned to make the bottles. Thankfully I stocked up on popcorn for movies and she would make popcorn for herself and I. It lasted 10 days. The crazy thing was I could feel it come on and worsen in real time.


Then, a month later, the baby got sick. Fever, cough, dizziness and completely out of it and looked so miserable. Then maybe 8 hours later, I felt what I had before come back only faster. This time it was a little different; I still had the burning lungs and fever, but the fatigue and dizziness weren't as bad so I wasn't bedridden this time. What was worse was the constant chest pain that was debilitating if I stood for too long or stressed too much. There was one point it hurt so badly I considered calling an ambulance because I thought I might be having a heart attack. That time lasted 7 days. 

What I didn't appreciate was the second time for some reason every time I talked to anyone it took forever for us to understand what the fuck the other was trying to say. I took the baby to the doctor and it legit took a good 10 minutes of frustrating conversation to understand ""Ok, here's your mask. Please take a seat in that area over there and someone will be with you soon"". Even my friends and family didn't get wtf was up with my brain suddenly. It was really frustrating which only made the chest pain worse.


Edit: I forgot to add shortness of breath, even while laying down. That was annoying when people called me.

If I was lucky enough to speak to a human, they'd either say they can't help me, say I'll get a phone call, redirect me right back to the main menu after being on hold for 30 minutes, or hang up right after saying ""Ok ma'am I'm going to pull up your information"".


I finally got one guy who seemed like he genuinely wanted to help, so he advised me to get a new card. But when he directed me to disputes, I was disconnected. Every time I'd select the dispute option, I'd almost immediately be disconnected. It's so unbelievably frustrating.
