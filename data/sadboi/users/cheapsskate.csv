StopSelfHarm,fqe4xeg,t3_gb4srq,1589301812.0,"I used to self harm when I was 12, everyone's experience may be different but I got a lot quieter when I'd get back into the habit. My family never found out, so I couldn't vent to them and I would put on a mask of happiness, just please try to be there for your child as much as possible and if she's sensitive (Like I was and still am), don't joke about it like my dad did, it made things worse even if I didn't show it. 

I'm not a parent myself and I'm terrible at giving out advice, but I hope this helps."
