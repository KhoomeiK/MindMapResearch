I‚Äôm waiting to see how it is on the first of the month/beginning (APRIL 1st) being that‚Äôs when most retail stores are always busy because of elderly monthly checks, disability checks, EBT CHECKS etc. The reason most stores were ransacked to begin with was due to  all this chaos happened in the beginning of the month so we already get our regular monthly customers who get paid monthly, plus income tax people, and panic buyers which was already a recipe for disaster. That‚Äôs just my theory though We still get the panicky morning people lining up which is retarded In my opinion because we haven‚Äôt been getting daily stocks like we used to due to high demand, so we won‚Äôt have everything even in the morning. So once we get rid of panic buyers we can finally go back to normal."
