Hairporn,fnqhjtk,t1_fnqagl8,1587164740.0,"Yes definitely better when it’s dry. I just comb mine out before I get in the shower and seems to work fine for me. I do one thing that helps me with knotting and with my hair drying straighter. But it’s kind of silly looking lol. So once my hair has dried maybe 40ish% (doesn’t really matter how dry or wet) I flip my hair around. Side to side, backwards and forwards. It really help i dont know why but I’ve been doing it for like ten years"
Hairporn,fnq06lh,t1_fnon2y8,1587155203.0,So your hair is very elastic and when it’s wet it’s extra elastic. Which would seem like a good thing but when you’re combing out knots and pull on  them. Your hair will stretch and then break which creates worst and more breakage then it breaking from being dry. If you like combing when wet because it makes your hair look better after drying. I would work very very slowly and always make sure to work your way from the tips to scalp
Hairporn,fno34jn,t3_g2sz9p,1587110319.0,It does that’s what I like
Hairporn,fno27s0,t1_fno0r2y,1587109387.0,I wash 1-2 times a week. Always use a wide tooth comb (never comb when wet) I use a hair towel. They’re supppper convenient and so much lighter than a regular towel and they’re softer so all in all will prevent breakage. I don’t use any kind of heat. I haven’t more then twice in the passed 8 years (weddings and such) and I try to braid my hair every night before bed. I like braids since I don’t put heat on my hair it switches up my look which is nice
Hairporn,fno1x9y,t1_fno06hx,1587109095.0,Thank you! Im not sure if it’s my shampoo or the hair oil I use but the shampoo and conditioner is from this brand called prose. It’s one of those companies where you take a survey and tell them what kind of hair you have and what you want to improve. I’ve tired other brands like this before and I like this one so far. The oil I use is Olaplex bonding oil. Seems to work well for me. My hair definitely looks smoother and shinier since I started using these but that’s just me

longhair,fnmkoze,t1_fnmja75,1587073171.0,"I feel you! Every time I go in for a trim they end up cutting inches off. I love my hair but it is a little too long for my liking right now. I haven’t used anything specific for my hair to grow. I used to do masks when I first started growing it but I don’t think that really helped all that much. Haven’t done them in many years. I’m just very gentle with it. I only use wide tooth combs, don’t comb when it’s wet. Braid it at night to prevent breakage and I don’t put product in it. Nor do I put heat on it. The thing is it’s taken 7-8 years to get my hair to the point where it’s at now. Some girls are just blessed with thick hair that grows like weeds. I know not putting any heat on it is probably the biggest reason it’s so healthy"

I’m too scared to try it again but the moon moisturizing one is actually good! I wouldn’t say it’s a game changer but when I wanna treat myself I use it. I don’t use strong masks anymore like detox masks (haven’t found one I love). Just hydrating ones but I want to be as gentle with my skin as possible. So I find just moisturizing and using all my other products (especially the ones I suggested) has realllly kept my skin clear! I eat like shit and touch my face all the time. I’m not perfect lol but I’m trying and bitch its workin!!

SkincareAddicts,fgph1ox,t1_fgp7shv,1581004642.0,"Yessss it’s so good for that! It won’t dry your face out at all but I’d suggest using the hyaluronic acid before you use the niacinamide! They work together and if you’re worried about feeling dry the hyaluronic acid will help with that, without making your feel oily at all. It’s a water based serum so not greasy feeling!"

SkincareAddicts,fgolv81,t1_fgokndo,1580975161.0,"I use the hyaluronic acid after I wash my face. I put it on while my face is STILL WET. Thats very important! Really helps lock in the moisture! Then I use the niacinamide (3 drops), then matrixyl (3 drop) then retinoid (3 drops). The lactic acid and AHA 30% + BHA 2% I switch off from each other every four days. So I only use each of those, once a week. It’s important to know, you don’t want to use your retinol the same day you used the AHA 30% + BHA 2% or the lactic. I’ve done a ton of research trying to find the best way to use these and this is what’s worked for me! Hope this helps!!"
SkincareAddicts,fgole8z,t1_fgoi46z,1580974570.0,"Yeah! Make sure you have a good cleanser first of all. I used the gentle foaming cleaner by clarins. It’s amazing! Cost around $25 and last about a year. Little goes a long way! One of my favorite brands of all time is the ordinary! Most of their products will cost you less than $10. As you can see I have a lot of their stuff lol so I’d say the three most important ones for everyday use are the hyaluronic  acid 2% + B5, niacinamide 10% + zinc 1%, one of their retinoid I use the new granactive one. I know it all sounds confusing with the fancy names but they’re very easy to use and you’ll see a massive difference in your skin within a couple days. The hyaluronic acid will hydrate the hell out of your face! The niacinamide will help with pore congestion, skin texture, redness and help prevent acne. The retinoids will help with fine lines and skin texture. Get yourself an eye cream (I used Mario budescu’s hyaluronic eye cream and it will last at least a year and cost $18) and finally a really hydrating moisturizer. I use clarins moisturizers. They are all amazing but can be pricey! If you’re looking to help with acne, skin smoothness, scars, pore size and signs of aging.(all reasons why I bought them)  Buy. This. Stuff. I’m tellin ya! I’m not an expert but I’ve researched a lot and tested many things on my skin through my life and I’ve never seen better results since I changed it up this year. The things I suggested I really think would work for anyone. Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions or want advice about anything! I’m happy to help:)"

None the less it’s all incredibly painful. But back to the partner topic. I hope to find someone as caring as you have. I just can’t seem let myself let it go and open up to someone. On top of having HS I was born without my right foot and I just can’t get the thought of my body being a complete shit show out of my head.

I didn’t expect it to come up but I also didn’t think it would be a big deal. She thought I was joking and laughed it off. I told her I was serious and she also looked disgusted and shocked. She told me bisexuality isn’t real and I must be a lesbian. I was so offended. Not because being called a lesbian is insulting but that she just undermined my sexuality. Part of my identity, so easily. Then she went on a rant trying to figure out how she fucked up me. How the sexual abuse I lived through as a kid “made me gay”. God that pissed me off. We talked about it later on and I calmly explained to her how she made me feel. She did feel sorry and  she’s over it now. It didn’t take that long but I also don’t talk about it with her much. She’ll be reminded when I talk about an attractive girl to my brothers or something but I don’t feel uncomfortable anymore.
