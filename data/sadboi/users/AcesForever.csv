When you have ten doctors from a single hospital all talking about information that isn't vetted or verified, that has a negative impact on the public health. While federal and state healthcare regulators have relaxed some laws (like telehealth laws), hospital policies regarding relaying information to the media is still in effect.

I work in a healthcare facility and I can't stress the importance of putting out information through the proper channels. The information needs to be vetted and verified. It's not some conspiracy to silence or cover up anything. A lot of big city hospitals are publicly owned and you can literally submit a public records request.

This is also not restricting people's freedoms. The government has already ruled that companies and organizations have the absolute right to put policies in place regarding what is communicated to the press on behalf of the organization. Again, because misinformation can get out and that in itself is harmful to the public.

The article posted is the Guardian's gripe about how physicians are afraid to talk to them on behalf of their healthcare organizations. And yes, this does impact HIPAA and privacy laws because a number of RN's and Physicians have recorded patients in hospital rooms without their consent. In the world of HIPAA and Healthcare Compliance, smart phones are a nightmare because of the amount of PHI that is in the background of those photos. 

In any job whether it's healthcare, or working for a public entity, they all have policies in place about media communications and they've been there for years. It's not like their hiding anything.

The big ones for the Netherlands and UK were obesity, diabetes, and heart related issues all which take a constant toll on the immune system. Roughly 75% of the patients that died were in the obese category. Diabetes is also big in Europe."
worldnews,fm0s8aa,t1_fm04lq8,1585665137.0,"My understanding is a 70% infection rate was a number that the CDC tossed around as a worst case scenario for the US with no restrictions in place. 

The bottom line is that these are projections that change all the time. No one really knows what the infection rate will be."
Anxiety,flzvbxr,t3_fs5u8z,1585634725.0,"In the year leading up to 40, I struggled with this because it felt like my life was half over. I asked myself what the point of doing anything was.

But then I just figured, ""fuck it"". And my attitude was not giving a shit because I'm going to die one day. And then I started going out and doing more stuff, meeting more people because why not? Might as well enjoy life while it's here. It's kind of like movies or books. You know that they'll end. But they're enjoyable as hell to watch/read.

And then I met someone and was going to settle down, start a family...and strangely enough, I found meaning in life. I didn't think it would be her, but it was. And suddenly, one day being dead? That anxiety went away. She did cheat on me and we split but I want to find that again with the right person. 

My point is - try to find meaning in life. It's different for everyone. And then you'll focus on living and enjoying life while it's here. We were given life. And that's pretty cool. This coronavirus thing has me a bit anxious but other than that, we'll get through it and go on with life."

PublicFreakout,flxbgtj,t1_flw1vty,1585579528.0,"I‚Äôm really hoping Dr. Fauci was right when he said that he expects there to be a second wave by fall but by then, they‚Äôll be prepared with various treatments and testing. So the infection rate and death toll won‚Äôt be as high. God I hope he‚Äôs right."
politics,flwgiri,t1_flwcxes,1585549866.0,"100% infection rate is impossible with the current restrictions we have in place and herd immunity is likely to happen long before that does. Top epidemiologists and immunologists say that the most without restrictions, worst case scenario is 70%.

Unless you're referring to Seattle and even there, the number is dropping. Infection rate is likely to slow down by summer and they're currently in clinical trials for a number of treatments and preventative drugs. 

No plague or virus has ever had a 100% infection rate and there have been far more deadlier and contagious diseases before this."
