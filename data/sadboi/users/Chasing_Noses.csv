Wow looks great!’ Yeah, cool, but what does it look like after a day full of errands? Thát would be helpful and a big factor in whether I want to buy it or not."

flightattendants,fc45ndy,t3_efzuxn,1577407271.0,"First of all; good for you that you’re focusing on your mental health. It’s so important to feel good and taking action is the first step. 

It’s not impossible, but it does take a little more effort. Scheduling sessions is difficult (for me at least, not knowing my schedule that far ahead). Sometimes having a pretty intense therapy session with lots of painful memories or hard realizations and then leaving the country again the next day while you’re still processing everything. But it’s all for a good cause so just do it! Please do it! 

My biggest pet peeve in the aviation industry is that it sometimes feels like a taboo to talk about mental health? Outsiders think we have ‘a perfect life’ and we never see the same crew again, so you can’t really talk about your ‘problems’ easily with them like you would to your colleague you see 5 days a week. And you don’t wanna risk losing your job either and you don’t want Karen from the mid galley to go to a supervisor and tell them ‘you were talking about depression’.

I don’t know, maybe I sound a bit negative. I don’t mean to. It’s just that I’ve been dealing with my mental health for over a decade now and I just wish people would treat it just as serious as a broken leg. If you need a friend or just want to talk about something, my DM’s are always open. :) Good luck!"
MakeupAddiction,fbc9fbc,t1_fb9s007,1576718815.0,That’s the best tip I’ve heard in a long time!
flightattendants,fb9900i,t1_fb98nll,1576632466.0,Yeah! It felt really personal with our name on it. Have to admit that I’m a total sucker for cards and notes. I always put a ‘goodmorning sunshines’ note in the galley for the early morning crew when I leave the plane at night. :)

flightattendants,f62emwo,t3_dq9qth,1572658114.0,"We’re all humans and humans make mistakes. It took me a year to finally feel at home at my airline.  It’s a completely different lifestyle that you can’t explain to your non-flying friends and family, and some people need a little more time to get used to it and that’s fine. Be aware of what your weaknesses are and try setting goals for yourself before every flight. ‘Today I will start an interesting conversation with a passenger’ or ‘today I will take initiative with a flight safety task’.  And don’t take yourself and this job too serious. It’s a great job with great perks but it’s not the most important job in the world. We’re not astronauts or brain surgeons. Relax! It’ll be fine! And if not and it turns out it’s not something for you.. it’s just a job! Not the end of the world.

Edit: and of course you can always send me a PM, even if it’s just to rant about an annoying purser..:’)"

You have no idea how much I needed to read that. Had a huge fight with my best friend who’s also my roommate last weekend. He literally said the words ‘mental abuse’. Been having problems sleeping ever since, hating myself and trying to figure out how I can change and fix this. You’re right. If I was truly an asshole, I wouldn’t be so hurt about the fact that I’m hurting him. 

Thank you."

It’s really fun and it also works well for my brain. On days I feel like staying in the hotel bed it forces me to at least go outside for a few minutes just to take a picture. But there are also the very short layovers, on those days bunny stays in as well :’) Do you guys have a ‘travel’ Instagram account? I’d love to see!"

Now I’m super comfortable with colleagues I’ve known for an hour and I just came back from 48 hours in Tokyo where I slept in a capsule hotel (dear god never again) and explored the city all by myself!"
