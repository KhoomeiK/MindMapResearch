NONE. no pto, no personal days, no sick leave. because i was always hired as a part time employee, and then picked up extra hours to be past full time. even the one call center i worked for had to earn your ""vacation"" time, which doubled as PTO and sick leave all in one. you had to work 1-2 YEARS to earn 3 DAYS of sick time. in my six months there i had earned 1 HOUR of PTO, which yes i did take because they were horrible there. 

america is fucked from the inside out. now because of this pandemic, and because im diabetic, im out of work. so is my girlfriend. and we can't file for unemployment because we can never reach anyone. we cant apply online and when we call we get a busy tone. for three weeks straight. we both have about $30 and no way of knowing when we will have any more. our bills and debt are now hanging in the balance, and food is the only thing we have to buy, but $60 until the end of this pandemic (which could be months) is not going to cut it.

pastlives,flac8xa,t3_fnh6ab,1584981004.0,"as a kid i‚Äôve never liked loud noises. i didn‚Äôt like fireworks unless they were from a safe distance. i didn‚Äôt like fire. i still don‚Äôt like these things. as a child and adult i‚Äôve always loved not just music, but a hoping baseline with a vibration you can feel in your bones. more recently i‚Äôve had anxiety (pre-covid-19, this has been going on for about a year and a half) of thinking stuff like ‚Äúwhen am i going to die? am i going to get sick and die randomly? what if i have a sickness that‚Äôs killing me now and i don‚Äôt know it?‚Äù. always worried about dying. i also have always loved and wanted to try MREs, prepackaged meals and i like really love canned food. which to me is strange considering in my family we eat fresh or frozen. turns out from a past life reading i have had many anxious lives thinking the same thing. i was a slave in ancient rome sold to fight the gladiators, wondering every day when i would be picked to fight (i never was, eventually i was sold to someone else and died a slave). i was a little girl in london in 1939 during the german bombings, my mother telling me we‚Äôd be okay but constantly praying we weren‚Äôt hit next (we weren‚Äôt, i lived). i was a soldier in WWII, allied american, part of the planes who dropped the bombs on omaha beach on DDay, wondering when i would suddenly die from the war (i didn‚Äôt. these were the planes btw that completely missed every single target on the beach). so these all explain why i don‚Äôt like loud noises or fire, and my anxiety surrounding instant or sudden death. the reader told me i‚Äôm surrounded by a band of five angels, not including my spirit guide and my guardian angel. so now the only hurdle is overcoming the glass anxiety projecting from my soul (which is WAY harder than you think lol ). for the first few days after the reading i felt on top of the world knowing my anxiety wasn‚Äôt really justified....until this virus happened and now i‚Äôm anxious again XD"

CATHELP,fl4onln,t3_fm6idx,1584818007.0,"take him! we adopted a cat who was previously homeless with her last owners(why they had to give her up). she was very very skittish and hid a  lot at first. we put her in the bathroom/walkin closet area (two rooms completely closed off from the rest of the house) and let her get used to the surroundings. she began to come out on her own when we would feed her. feed her, shut the door, come back 30 minutes later and she runs, but she was eating.food is always a good tool. always use food for training i say. 

&#x200B;

we let her get used to that space then began putting her in the other half of the house(alone) and our other cat in her space. did that for about a week. then back in their rooms by night time. then once both cats were used to the scent and sight of one another, we locked them both in the big space while we went to work. about a week of doing that then separate at night. then after that they roamed around everywhere just fine.

&#x200B;

keep in mind our kitty was malnourished and dealing with weight issues too so its longer adjustment times. some people just through both cats together and see how they do. if you care a lot about how both cats feel (like myself, i treat them almost as humans) i would try a few days separate, some time together and some time alone before merging completely."
