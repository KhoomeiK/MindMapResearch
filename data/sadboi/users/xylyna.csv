Anxiety,fkfzxfb,t3_fi9edk,1584146535.0,"Back when I was working, my work schedule was the only thing keeping me getting lost in my anxiety. Later I had some health problems and my life drastically changed, which came along with new reasons of anxiety. I can see where you're coming from. But, remember, people live to survive and our most powerful feature is adaptability. You can create your own schedule during this time and stay loyal to it. If you think school related subjects would be a good distraction, you can go ahead and further your studies on your own for now. Apart from these, I'm sure there's at least one thing you always wanted to do but couldn't, you can focus on that thing, like learning a new language.
Please keep in mind that you're strong enough to go through this period."

Anxiety,fkfz2bg,t3_fi8jgy,1584145941.0,"Mine does. Personally, I'm already pessimistic enough and I spend a good amount of time and effort to control it. One of the things I do for controlling is keeping my pessimistic thoughts to myself. I try not to go around and rain on everyone's parade. But once in a while I come across a friend who openly brings everyone, including himself/herself down. Usually I try to neutralize the negative comments by suggesting positive things, etc. but at the end of the day I find myself getting lost in all the negativity they've dumped on me. It's important to keep a certain relationship with this type of people, where you keep yourself at a distance which allows you to take a step back and save yourself from all the drama."

You're stating that you've abused your daughter over a long period of time and expecting her to treat you right after 7 years of not abusing.. no.. that's not how it works. This is wrong in so many levels.

If anyhing, your abuses very well might be the manifestation of her current behaviour."

Anxiety,fjxb1o9,t3_ffb16t,1583665567.0,"I've been dealing with something similar in the past 10 years. I decided to maintain a certain facade after going through a few bad experiences related with my mood and outbursts.

After these events, I decided to confide only in people I trust. I've also read this somewhere, in an article, that having someone as your support person is life saving. Not someone like a regular friend, not someone you can dump all your drama, but someone who can become the voice of reason and logic when you find it hard to gain perspective. Someone, who you can consult in critical times. This person can be a family member, your SO, or a close friend. But be careful on setting boundaries both for yourself and the other party. Like I mentioned, if it turns into you dumping all your negativity in them, it becomes quite hectic."
Anxiety,fjtlfu9,t1_fjtirz5,1583608816.0,"You can try to create an analysis report on this situation. I know, calling it a report sounds a bit over the top, but think about it like that to give it more context. First state your concern and support it only with the facts, not with 'what if's. Write down your current situation and how you'd want/wish it to be. Then set yourself a solid goal you can reach regarding your concern/anxiety. It can be both short or long-termed. On the next step, you need to come up with at least 10 solutions to overcome this situation. Don't be quick about it. Think on it and use this time effectively as you are brain-storming. Lay out all your options. This part can help you gain some perspective and see the bigger picture. It might be helpful to even get to this part. But if you want to continue, for the next step you can evaluate the 10 solutions you've come up with and choose the best ones to try. Based on the solution period, you can set yourself check-point dates to evaluate and see if they help you with your anxiety."

You can try introducing new actions to your daily life which will create small cracks in your depression/anxiety routines. I know it's easier said than done, but it all starts with small steps. You can do this. Having a bad day full of depression and anxiety doesn't mean that tomorrow is going to be the same."

Anxiety,fjdv8tz,t1_fjdqv1p,1583259920.0,"The book is ""The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Workbook: A Comprehensive CBT Guide for Coping with Uncertainty, Worry, and Fear"" by  Melisa Robichaud and Michel J. Dugas. I've read it in a language other than English, so I don't have any info about its availability elsewhere. (It was first published in 2019 in my country. The info in my copy says that the original book was first published in 2015.) The book is like a guide and it's even recommended to be followed along with a therapist. Right now I don't have the budget for a therapist, that's why I decided to try this book. The techniques I've mentioned are in 9th and 10th chapters, so if you're in a hurry you can directly focus on that part. But I highly recommend reading and practicing the exercises they give from the beginning. It might take a while, but it helped me greatly on identifying my anxiety triggers.

I had been dealing with anxiety but it was mostly joined with depression. For a while now I've been solely focusing on anxiety. In the book, they describe anxiety on a spectrum. We all feel a bit of it from time to time, but if it's hindering your daily life, you fall on the far end of the spectrum. For me, I've been suffering from it as long as I've known myself, including my childhood. And considering the nature of anxiety, it might be impossible for someone to rid themselves completely off of it. But I think with the right techniques it's possible to control it.

If you decided to try the techniques there, and want to share your thoughts or your process, please feel free to message. Please, keep in mind, this is not something you can make it go away in an instant. So spend time on learning and developing skills to cope with it. Also take your time with the book if you can."

Anxiety,fjcudd1,t3_fcgar7,1583237009.0,"Someone one once told me that my anxiety is making me fail to see the big picture. You're a grad student, think about the achievements you've done so far in your life. People with anxiety (like me) often get lost on a current problem/situation and let that thing rule their lives. But if you think about all the obstacles you've overcome so far, you can see that you're strong enough to tackle whatever life brings you. You've done this before, certainly you can do this again! It's cliche but believe in yourself!"
Anxiety,fjctt2k,t3_fcrfp3,1583236400.0,"I don't know if it'll be of any help, but one of the CBT techniques in dealing with anxiety is creating a detailed flow of events on your concern. I've been reading a book on it. (if you'd like, I can give you its title and writers)

Basically, they separate worries into 2 types. One for current concerns, one for hypothetical ones.

For the current concerns you detail your concern (make sure you do this on a piece of paper), and how you feel. Then you write down the possible outcomes, both positive and negative. Later, you think about at least 10 possible solutions or actions you can use to cope with it. Then you set a time frame for yourself and get into action. Check back with your notes and reflect upon your previous thoughts, comparing them with your new ones.

I've been dealing with anxiety as far as I've known myself and honestly I'm still trying to figure out a solution. But these type of exercises help me on a daily basis. If you have time and if you feel as desperate as me :) you can give it a try."
