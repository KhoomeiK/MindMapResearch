Marijuana,fqubbpb,t3_gkwq11,1589655648.0,"5 years of daily smoking (once a day for sleep) and the occasional daytime sometimes to help treat my PTSD. Ive only really noticed that sometimes that i feel a little dumb or dont think as much as i should have before doing something. 

But i try not to over smoke as i dont need it as often during the day than i do at night. I usually will only smoke during the day if my anxiety is really high, or my PTSD is in full swing and I cant handle my own thoughts, or when that time of the month comes and i cant take the cramps.

But i still have a full time job, making good money. Im lazy (i was like that before weed so, thats just me as a whole lmao) but im still productive and do regular things like cleaning, chores, doing the shopping etc.

In no way has it negatively impacted me.
Yeah, the smoke isnt good for your lungs. But thats about it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Other people get that sickness where they no longer can smoke at all, nor edibles nothing thc related. It definitely happens. So definitely always be using in moderation if you arent treating yourself for something, and if you are, definitely invest in getting your medical card!

My experience (before pandemic) was extremely smooth sailing. They make it seem as though you need 20+ documents to prove your case. I was approved with a letter stating my final diagnosis as PTSD, and a letter of recommendation from my PCP.

I would assume they dont tell your insurance (ive not received a piece of paper from MA health regarding me obtaining my MMJ card) though if you have MA health you qualify for the hardship discount.

You're still paying $50 1/8th, you're just no longer paying the tax, and you get first priority at a med/rec dispensary which is definitely a benefit (i hated the 45 minute line at NETA)

I personally havent heard any complaints about MMJ doctors, so i am unsure if the price makes a big difference whether they want $100-$200 i paid $210 and that included them filling out and submitting all the paperwork for me.  But the offset of that price, just about every dispensary will be giving you new patient discounts, ermont does $100 off your order of $200 or you can spend $100 and use $50 off and save the other $50 for your next visit."

Most importantly, ring the OB or even her PCP in the morning.

See if there is anything you can do to help her, even if its letting her take a 30 minute relaxing shower while you tend to baby, or letting her take a 30-1 hour long nap while you tend to baby on your lunch break.

Do you think at any time even in the future, that those things could possibly ever be dropped, given solid evidence to prove? (Again, not just her case, but others as well)

bostontrees,fiz6c2w,t1_fiz616y,1582855192.0,"You're welcome! I havent posted in this sub yet but figured today was the day to finally do so :) 

I was so freaking nervous they were gonna say no as soon as he said ""OP, you are qualified"" i cried. Legitimately cried. It didnt feel real, i was so excited to have better access to my medicine!"
bostontrees,fiz65ml,t1_fiz5ygy,1582855068.0,"Going from Rec to Med are two totally different experiences, now experiencing the med part. Usually when i go to NETA as rec, your grams 1/8ths and beyond are already pre-packed because they have now thousands of rec users coming in daily. But the medical experience, whooooo, they pulled out a big tub of the weed i was getting, they fanned the smell in my face and weighed it all infront of me. Definitely felt VIP lmao"
bostontrees,fiz5x9f,t1_fiz5pxe,1582854906.0,"It was really awesome! I have anxiety about spending money on myself, and why i put it off 3 times.
I went to the Holistic Center in Brighton, i already know my stuff about weed, what i need. I brought a TON of paperwork backing my PTSD even from childhood when it wasn't a PTSD diagnosis. They only wanted the letter from my psychiatrist stating my diagnosis as of 2019, and a letter of recommendation from my PCP. I paid $210 and was in an out within 45 minutes :)"

Food safety and sanitation here, i do try my best to make sure that people know whats in my dishes. But if you have a life threatening allergy, you dont fucking eat food willy nilly thinking everyone knows.

My boyfriend is highly allergic to whey protein and tree nuts, he ALWAYS asks before even putting something on his plate if something contains milk/whey and or tree nuts. 

You're not responsible for someone who went ""its fine i have an epi-pen"" and took that stupid risk without asking. He is responsible to know his allergens are dangerous and take those precautions and you're not expected to pay for that. You arent a restaurant who fucked up his order, he was at a house event and should have asked."

AmItheAsshole,fi1n9u2,t3_f5tn9u,1582061044.0,NTA my s/o used to do this and lort it killed me to do dishes! The smell is unbearable! But i asked him to either rinse them at work or open them before putting them in the sink (as i dont get to the dishes daily) but he did the adult thing and did what i asked because the funk was killing me slowly.

retailhell,fdzxqfk,t3_encvst,1578798366.0,"I am so with you on this.
I just left my (hopefully) last retail job last sunday. Ive been in retail since i was 19 (now 25) i definitely reccomend looking at recruiters! I never tried one until a few weeks ago, and landed a $17/hr job entry level! With no other experience than customer service and basic computer knowledge. 

I felt so trapped for so long and i just want you to know there is an end to being stuck in retail. 
Definitely shoot your shot, my boyfriends advice to me also: ""Most places that are filling out these requirements most of the time dont know what is actually required, so if you think you're under qualified still go for it"""

If we were taking like a pound of cheese home yeah it would be an issue.

The management did not consider that stealing so 🤷🏻‍♀️"
