Disneycollegeprogram,fcynt0q,t3_eje312,1578083519.0,"I did my first program in 2012 after my freshman year in college, then went back for spring 2017 after I graduated. And I have to agree with what‚Äôs been said before, it definitely felt waaaay different the second time. I went from Magic Kingdom attractions to Animal Kingdom attractions, and it was challenging due to the management. In my first program I was working maybe over forty hours during peak, but at AK I was working over sixty hour weeks every week, no days off, and most times open to close. In my first program I was able to enjoy the parks and all the extracurriculars, that was not possible on my second program. 

So I guess I would just say that it honestly truly depends on your position and location. I think I was just placed in a very understaffed area, so maybe it would have been different elsewhere, but I have to say it was not as wonderful as my first program. 

I did it post graduation because I knew it was the last time I would probably ever get a chance. Personally I didn‚Äôt experience any issue finding a job after the program (the program is a great resume booster), so I maybe wouldn‚Äôt worry about that. I would just worry about if the high expectations can ever be reached by the reality of working again in a pretty low paying job with few benefits."
