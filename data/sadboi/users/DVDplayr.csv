cscareerquestions,forkg21,t3_g9404q,1588013731.0,"You make a couple of points and I will try to respond to as many as I can remember after reading your post once.

Do not feel like you have to talk all the time. You are a junior dev and you do not understand every aspect of the product and tech stack. You do not have to have an opinion about everything and no one should be expecting you to.

For stand ups, make sure to have notes. That might help. You won't be struggling to remember stuff if you know what you plan to say and in what order. Just glance at the notes and talk about what you have worked on since the last stand-up and what you plan to work on till the next.

Public speaking in tough for some people, and that is something you have to overcome through practice. There are two important things here: fear and confidence. The more you have of one, the less you have of the other. Both are important and you need to have the right balance. Fear helps you get work done and confidence helps you power through if when you haven't done enough (happens sometimes). You might also consider getting help from a professional (read therapist) who can help you with confidence issues and public speaking, if it's an issue you don't think you can fix by yourself.

One thing to remember is that your supervisor/team lead/manager and the engineers on your team (basically all the people at most of the meetings you attend) are your friends. Especially your supervisor and manager want you to do well because at the end of the day you doing well makes them look good to their boss. They are not your enemies. If you have reason to think otherwise, you are probably in a very toxic shop that you do not want to be in.

Also, you should not be worried about your manager making a mistake in hiring you. If they did, that's their fault as a manager, not yours. Stop worrying about other people's mistakes. Worry about your mistakes and try to rectify them and you will be fine.

Here's your biggest enemy: not asking enough questions or fear that your question will be considered stupid. Whenever you do not understand anything mentioned in a meeting, ask about it. Maybe do not ask it in the middle of the meeting d disrupt the meeting's flow. Ask a coworker about it later. Find someone who you feel comfortable communicating with and ask them your questions. Once you are comfortable with the person, you will not feel like your questions are stupid even if they are. And who cares if people think your questions are stupid, you are getting paid to carry out a job and you have questions about your job, so it is essentially your job to get questions answered. You are just doing your job when you ask stupid questions. When you are not asking those questions, you are not doing your job well. You have to decide whether you want to do your job well or not."
csMajors,forhs1b,t3_g94rjv,1588012455.0,"Math. Reasoning on the last paragraph.

In college, you want to take math at least up to linear algebra (i.e. calc 1, calc 2, linear, and maybe even vector calc \[calc iii, but not real analysis\] coz it's fun). 

From calc I (single-variable calculus) and calc II (multi-variable calculus)  you will hopefully know enough about linear/polynomial/logarithmic/exponential functions and their rates of change to appreciate and enjoy the higher level algorithms courses in cs.

Linear is used a lot in cs, not only in the hype areas such as ml, but also in areas such as computer graphics -- basically anywhere you need to solve a bunch of linear equations -- which might be a lot of places. In fact, in a lot of the graphics papers I read in college, they were using abstract algebra (higher level algebra course which I do not recommend taking if you are not good at math) concepts which was pretty neat.

Some people are mentioning discrete math. I have not idea what that is because my school did not have such a course, but I know it is a required course in a lot of cs curriculums. Take a look into that.

Of course a lot of cs majors do not take all the math classes I mentioned above and you certainly won't be required to. However, you might end up finding out that math is actually pretty fun and major/minor in it like I did. But right now you should focus on solidifying your basics, which involves learning the pre-calc material well.

*The reason I said math and not cs is because in my experience most intro cs courses assume that you have 0 cs knowledge and have not coded a lot and will factor that into the curriculum. This means that you will get a decent bit of time to get the hang of coding and thinking like a coder. However, math curricula are less forgiving. Since math classes build on past material over the semester and over multiple semesters, if you fall behind or do not understand certain concepts, it becomes difficult to catch up. So get a head start on math.*"
gradadmissions,foorpo7,t1_foop8fk,1587945047.0,">MS in itself is a research oriented degree

I can only speak about the US, and from what I know, most masters programs in ML/CV/NLP here are cash-cow programs that universities use to make money. I'm sure you know this already if you are looking into MS programs in the US.

That being said, there are obviously many masters programs that have a research/thesis component and prepare you for a Phd. From what I have read, most TA/RA ships at big name schools in CS, like the ones you mention, go to Phd candidates since Phd is supposed to be a fully-funded program for the most part, whereas a masters is not. This leaves very few TA/RAships for masters students, so if you need to fund your masters program, it can become very competitive to get into one of these coveted research-based masters programs.

This is not to say that getting into professional masters programs at prestigious universities is any easy feat. But with good stats, you have a good chance of getting in if you are paying your way through MS."

cscareerquestions,fo5dlly,t3_g5i35b,1587523118.0,"I had no internships throughout college. The summer before my senior year, I lived in my parents' basement sleeping and playing video games all day and working a non-tech minimum wage job at night. For those interested, parents did not have a room for me in the house, and the tenant of the one-bedroom basement apartment was having trouble paying rent, so I became his roommate (my own parents being my landlord) (not harsh parents, just low on cash). I graduated the following December and started full-time as a software engineer with great benefits, and as much as I hate to mention this, a six-figure salary. It is possible. My job is not sexy, but I'm learning stuff and not having to eat doritos and soda for dinner, so can't complain. Here is the magic recipe:

1. Ignore most entry level/internships posts on this sub
2. Remember that there are much much bigger number of Small-N companies than Big-N companies. In fact, if your ONLY goal is to work for Big-N, it's highly likely that you are screwed
3. Play the numbers game with job applications
4. There is supposed to be a shortage of technical people so you *will* find a job sooner or later
5. There are many many companies that do not do leetcode style interviews, if that is an area of worry

Feel free to dm me if you would like me to expand on any of these and more (too lazy to write if no one will read).

Lastly, a note about the current economy. Yes, you may expect hiring to slow down, but I doubt it will slow down so much that you cannot find a job. Do you really think people are spending ""family time"" in lockdown and locking their electronic devices away? They are using more of it. And the more they use these devices, the more work we software engineers have. **Look at Facebook, they are launching a gaming platform ahead of schedule to get people hooked while they quarantine.** If there is anyone who knows whether you are using phone, it's probably Facebook (and other people that we should not talk about)."

Disagree. You cannot predict the stock market, but does that mean you invest all your money in penny stocks and high risk stocks?
