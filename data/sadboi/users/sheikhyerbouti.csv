talesfromtechsupport,fqpw93w,t3_gjv4hu,1589555125.0,"I was part of a local wargaming group a few years ago that had an ""open carry advocate"" asshat who would not only wear his gun on a hip holster, but made a big show about ""resting"" his hand on the butt. If anyone asked him to put it away, Mr. Open-Carry would guffaw and say ""Yer welcome to *try* to take it from me! *hyuck*""

One day we got a new guy who said he was a Navy vet, but very cagey about what he did while in the service.

Mr. Open-Carry loved servicemen because he spent a whopping 2 years in the Marines and called them ""brothers in arms"". The Vet was very put off by Mr. Open-Carry from the get-go, especially with the casual way Mr. Open-Carry would fondle his sidearm.

Finally, one day the Vet called Mr. Open-Carry out:

V: Could you not rest your hand on your sidearm like that?

OC: What's the problem?

V: Putting your hand on your weapon like that is deemed an ""escalated behavior"" - an action that communicates  a readiness to use a firearm.

OC: I'm glad I'm making my point clear then!

V: It can get you - and those around you - shot before you even squeeze off a round. If you think *these* people around you *(indicating the fellow gamers)* are a threat, you have no business with a weapon - especially in public.

OC: Well, yer welcome to *try* to take it off me.

V: You don't want me to do that.

During the above exchange, the Vet had been slowly walking toward Mr. Open-Carry and doing his best to make sure that OC's attention was solely on him. And now the Vet was literally in his face. There were a few tense seconds until finally Mr. Open-Carry relented and quickly departed, mumbling about his right to bear arms all the while.

The group leaders later told Mr. Open-Carry that while he was welcome, his gun wasn't and he didn't return."

talesfromtechsupport,fo48vxf,t3_g5l25m,1587500206.0,"In a previous MSP job one of our clients was a large law firm with a couple dozen paralegals working under it.

One of them, Jeremy, always had a problem with his workstation around the end of the month and it was always something different - yet always required an onsite fix that was easy to do.

Jeremy had complained to his supervisors about his ""broken computer"" issues enough that they contacted their account manager to ask what was going on. So my boss pulled all of his tickets and, with rare exception, all of them happened to fall just on the last week of the month. The reason why this was an issue for the client was Jeremy was always behind on delivering a month-end report indicating the hours worked on each case (important for billing).

The final straw was when Jeremy called in asking for a replacement mouse because his current one was broken. Yes, he had restarted his workstation. Yes, he made sure the connection was secure. Yes, a mouse from another workstation worked - but Jeremy needed a special ergonomic mouse and refused to use it.

Because the call happened outside of their scheduled onsite visit, it was considered an ""emergency ticket"" and subject to a premium charge. When the onsite tech arrived, he was not surprised at what he found. No, Jeremy did NOT have a special ergonomic mouse - it was the same standard mouse that everyone else used. No, the mouse was NOT securely connected, it was barely sat in the port. After reseating the cable, the mouse worked perfectly - the tech even left a spare one there (still in the wrapping) just in case.

Jeremy's boss was furious and asked us to start logging all activity on Jeremy's system. A month later we found out that Jeremy was no longer working for the firm. Turns out that the reason why Jeremy's month-end reports were always late was because he was spending the time needed to generate them to falsify how much work he actually spent on his caseload. After Jeremy left, calls from their office suddenly dropped off."

10 years ago I used to play in a free poker league (I was a poor college student) held at two different bars so I have loads of hilarious degen stories, but this is still my favorite.

One of the players, Jackie, had a strategy of doubling up in the first round and then making the rest of the table miserable with her wild play - she literally never met a hand she could fold. She also did assumed she was better skilled than everyone else, instead of merely lucky, which annoyed EVERYONE.

I was chip leader at my table when it got broken down and I got moved to Jackie's table into the big blind. From the downtrodden faces of my fellow players at the table, I could already tell that Jackie - whose stack was larger than mine - was already making their lives hell with loose but lucky play.

First hand comes out and I get 5s7s. Jackie makes a 5x raise, the button calls begrudgingly, and I feel like defending my blind, so I call too.

The Flop: 4s 6s 8s

Trying my damnedest not to shit myself, I check - praying that Jackie called me with AsX. Sure enough she makes a 10x raise. The Button growls ""Dammit Jackie!"" and accidentally open-face mucks KQd. I call, hoping another spade comes on the turn.

Turn: 9d

Again, I check. Jackie makes another 10x bet and I call.

The river: Ks

I check. Jackie shoves all-in and I snap call.

What happens next I have never seen before or since.

Cackling with glee, Jackie rolls over As8c for her flush and makes a move to scoop the pot. However, when I reveal my 5s7s for the straight flush - the ENTIRE TABLE (except me) stands up and says ""NO, JACKIE! A STRAIGHT FLUSH beats a FLUSH! YOU LOSE!!!"" The next two minutes are Jackie arguing with the rest of the table about my straight flush, which gets the ""tournament director"" (guy with the tables and chips) called to settle the matter.

While I didn't knock Jackie out, the hand certainly took her down a couple pegs, and she got felted pretty quickly afterwards  as the other players were no longer putting up with her wild play. I had never seen that much pent-up animosity toward one player get unleashed by an entire table before.

(And, yes, I took down the tournament for $20 in bar bucks.)

Like I said, I got loads of stories from playing in this league - but that's my favorite."

Opening the relationship has to be something mutually considered with agreed upon boundaries and rules for communicating them. Forcing an existing relationship to accept that their partner has been emotionally (and physically) intimate with someone else is quite the blow and never turns out well.

Honestly, it sounds like your wife wants to have her cake and eat it too: She wants to be able to be intimate outside your marriage without jeopardizing the economic security your provide.

Not that you should, but have you asked your wife if she would be comfortable with you seeing other women? Her response will tell you much.

What your wife has done is given you an ultimatum - either you accept that she's going to be with this other guy or you end the marriage. Ultimatums are like grenades, they can't be ""unexploded"" and your best option is to pick up the pieces to do what's best for yourself and your kid."

J: Free food, how does that work?

G: Simple - you get a reservation at a fine dining establishment for two, look nervous for about 15 minutes, then check your phone and get misty eyed - BAM! - free dinner from a sympathetic waiter!

J: Unbelievable...

G: It's been my tradition for the last 7 years and has never failed on me once! This time I'll actually have a participant!

J: You really think she's gonna break up with you, why?

G: The signs are there, Jerry. She always looks like she's on the tip of asking something, but then holds back at the last minute.

J: Has she been distant or unresponsive?

G: Yeah, but that's not really a big deal for me."

A pigeon that was roosting on an overhanging wire keeled over dead and landed in that sweet spot, sending a sickening thud throughout the park.

It was the most disturbing sound I had ever heard."

talesfromtechsupport,ffv3wir,t3_evclta,1580255078.0,"I've posted this before, but it fits:

One of my dad's friends was an electrician that also handled emergency calls, but at a $80/hr premium (this was in the 1980s).

One night the friend gets a call from a panicked man because the light won't turn on in his laundry room. The friend says, ""If I come out there, there will be a minimum $80 charge. Have you made sure the switch is on and changed out the bulb?"" The man insists he had and demands he come over RIGHT NOW.

So the friend shows up, gets escorted to the laundry room with its light out. Friend tries the switch - nothing turns on. Friend checks the breaker - everything looks right there. Friend changes the bulb - light turns on.

The man was invoiced for $80 + $5 for the bulb."

It was like something out of a movie - I was walking alone at night through a park and a man pulled a knife on me, demanding my wallet.

At the time I was going through a pretty rough patch - I had divorced the previous year, my wife refused to let me see our kids (in case I said something bad about her), a child support order had come through taking out nearly half of my paycheck, and all of the friends I made when I was married were supporting my ex (because ""she's going through a lot""). So I figured, fuck it and told the man that if he killed me, he could have my wallet. The would-be mugger called me a ""crazy-ass motherfucker"" and walked away disgusted.

And that's when I realized I might have a problem."

I informed him of the same to which he said ""How about I come down there and kick your ass?""
