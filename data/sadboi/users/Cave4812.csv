askgaybros,fr3cb4t,t3_gme906,1589854341.0,"Hormones also play a role.  Men can lose weight easier than women b/c of hormones like testosterone, which promote metabolism and burning fat in favor of lean muscle.  Testosterone also increases insulin sensitivity, so this also plays a role.

Androgen Deprivation (loss of male hormones) decreases insulin sensitivity by about 10% and leads to derangements in fat metabolism.  Men who have Diabetes have been found to have lower average testosterone levels than their non-Diabetic peers.

If you really struggle with weight then there are certain medications which can help by suppressing appetite.

One of these is Adderall, but an even more potent one is Desoxyn.  It's prescription meth.  Both are obviously very addictive, and getting insurance approval for the latter is an utter nightmare because it's a highly controlled substance."

Is anyone completely heterosexual or homosexual? Science says shades of bisexuality are most present in animals.  Humans are no exception.  Sexuality doesn't really come in discreet values but rather it's a spectrum.  So remember that for it will give you hope."
askgaybros,fqxmkf2,t3_gl95b4,1589734618.0,"I think the dynamics in gay relationships are much different than straight ones.

Heterosexual relationships have rules and traditions pertaining to roles that the male and female gender are supposed to play.  The man is aggressive and dominant; the female is passive and submissive.

But gay relationships throw this out the window.  You have two individuals of the same sex, so there's really no defined rules for things like courtship.  In one sense this is fantastically liberating compared to the rigidity of straight relationships, but in another sense it leaves much uncertainty in a sense.  Rules make things cemented, but they also help establish order and organization.

I can tell you that I don't personally fear dating because I fear for my sense of independence.  But I can't speak for other males.

Studies have however indicated that one of the biggest sources of tension and causes of domestic violence in gay male relationships is both partners vying for alpha male status.  This does imply that successful gay relationships are at least to some extent dependent on one partner relinquishing some of their power to another."

The two biggest things he needs to focus on are going back full-time to college and to stop with the porn so he can spend quality time with you.  Seems like he's really too obsessed with the cartoon porn.

I think you're angry, and that you have a right to be angry.

schizophrenia,fqpccy9,t3_gjx7am,1589542434.0,"We're not exactly sure what causes ventricular enlargement in the brains of those with Schizophrenia.  Not all brains of those with the condition even show this.

On average, there's about a 5% reduction in hippocampal size in Schizophrenia.  Certain medications like Antipsychotics and even Lithium have been found to promote Neurogenesis in this region as well as others.

Many brains of those with Schizophrenia analyzed post-mortem don't even show any significant difference from the brains of those without the condition.  It's highly doubtful that Schizophrenia is even a monolithic condition; instead it seems to be multiple.

Structural brain changes in Schizophrenia aren't progressive, unlike in Dementia.

Part of what makes Schizophrenia so fascinating is that it's so complex and mysterious simultaneously.  There's even evidence it may have been evolutionarily useful to our ancestors (the shaman theory) throughout history.  It has a strong genetic component, so we're not sure why it persists when it serves no apparent function (at least in westernized 'modern' societies).  

Based on my research, a significant part of the clinical outcomes of Schizophrenia cases would change for the better if we took an evolutionary view of Schizophrenia.  The condition causes extreme suffering undoubtedly but if individuals with Schizophrenia were at least partly seen in more neutral terms as having just a difference instead of a 'disease' then things could be a lot less stigmatized and clinical outcomes could be improved.

Finally, I'm not a huge advocate of always relying on antipsychotic medications.  They drastically increase the chances of developing metabolic disorders, and instead I'm a big advocate of more natural therapies like treatment with Lithium Carbonate, access to exercise, meaningful economic opportunities, and animal/socializing therapies."
