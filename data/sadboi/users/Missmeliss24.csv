Look at the label. You won‚Äôt find anything that packs that nutritional punch, with so little food. It also sticks with you. If that‚Äôs all I have, great! I know I‚Äôve given my body nutrients for the day and let it go‚ô•Ô∏è"
Stutter,fit3mzj,t1_fis8hrg,1582703047.0,"It‚Äôs true. It does. It‚Äôs thehuman condition to reject truth when it‚Äôs so contrary to something you believe is impossible.
