What sucks about platforms like FB and IG is that being a platform that makes money on advertising will always skew to making its users feel insecure. It’s the only way to drive new sales. I feel you, go at your own pace—it’s the only one that matters.

Recently, I’ve decided to put all my engineering efforts into mental health, and surprisingly, we were recently awarded the National Science Foundation grant for new artificial intelligence technologies. Hope we can accelerate our team efforts to help as many people as possible.
