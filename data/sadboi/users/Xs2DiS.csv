In the end, I was referred to some site that provided information I already knew, which I had pointed out as well, and basically rearranging your life (such as exercising, adopting a healthy diet and sleep pattern, etc.) was the solution, according to the source.

That said, the actual reply. 

They are. It's almost scary how they know me and are able to help me through text only. I never met her in real, or even talked to her, but I don't mind. I truly appreciate the time they have taken to talk to me about my arguably silly woes. 

The same goes to you. You have mentioned enough that made me think, positively. So, many thanks. 

I took your advice, in a way. I told her that she could always talk to me to, if she needed it. I like to think I can be a great listener, as I have done that in the past as well. For example, my closest friend from high school had some issues, mental and about his sexuality. I made sure to listen and offer the best thoughts I could give to him. 

I don't she will though as it seems she's pretty comfortable in life, as it stands. But I hope she knows it's a possibility to talk to me if needed. 

I managed to sleep through the night yesterday. It was something new. I still don't feel entirely energetic because there's some ""leftover fatigue"", so to speak, but it's a start. I'm happy about that. 

And I can relate. People haven't really told me to just get some sleep but in a way they have. They meant well, but it's not that easy as said, but if they can't relate to it it must seem like an issue you fully have control over yourself to them, I suppose, which is false. I was up for 24h, and extremely tired, but I still woke up 2h later, unable to fall asleep again. There wasn't much I could do about randomly waking up and not falling asleep again. 

I would love to give you some advice in return, but I think I'm not a specialist right now on improving one's sleep. At any rate, I do want to express again I hope your sleep pattern will become healthy for you, if you struggle with it. You're a good person; you deserve it imo. 

Lastly, I'll take a look into behavioral cognitive therapy. Once again, good advice. I appreciate that."

As for Ellie, I thought about the belly flop attack but I would not call it ""Catch a Ride"". Maybe ""Cuddles & Murder""? (That was her introduction description in BL2, I believe.)

Down the line Seein' Dead is significantly superior as it allows you better to fight harder enemies (boss fights) but Antifreeze made him already quite capable handling regular mobs quite quickly. (Except for Anointed foes; f them.)
Borderlands,fczhpqi,t3_eiyogy,1578101505.0,"Same here. I've been trying to get leggos with ideal Anointed stats on them but generally I get vanilla leggos (M4, with and without luck relics). I feel like on M4 even mini-bosses should at least drop a leggo (Tink of Cunning for example has dropped only shite items lately :/). 

But besides the low drop rate for Anointed gear, I'm dreading the increased level cap more. Even though I don't have all ""best"" gear the ones I use and like will become futile."
Borderlands,fczh2jx,t1_fcy1e09,1578101097.0,I couldn't do it. I just try by trial and error. A lot of times but throwing math at it is flipping perfect. Not that I get most of it though.
borderlands3,fcr2isv,t3_ei3t9h,1577895840.0,I guess this is how they try to keep endgame *fresh*.
borderlands3,fcr1tw1,t1_fcqzs7g,1577895542.0,I hate Vaughn.
borderlands3,fcljdhj,t3_ehl0js,1577749155.0,"The time between slamming and being able to engage in combat again feels a tad tedious and leaves you vulnerable. Just for this reason I try to avoid slamming, unless I'd wear the 57% DR relic, I suppose. Gameplay feels super smooth to me but slamming the ground ruins the pace. Slamming sounds impactful though, which is something positive."
borderlands3,fclis8v,t3_ehm5cw,1577748765.0,"I wouldn't mind a leggo grinder that consumes 4 of the same leggos and give you one back with a random anointed stat on it. 

Also, being able to mayhaps pay for gear you love so that it levels with you would be neat too, I suppose."
borderlands3,fchhal0,t3_eh1i4d,1577650463.0,"It's really barely playable for me if I join someone. It's a shame because I didn't experience this much lag in the previous games. Lag in menus is even worse while doing co-op, and moreover opening your menu affects others as well. I hope this will get better in the future."
borderlands3,fchfl9o,t3_egztfg,1577649994.0,"I've got the same, except for the additional modifiers. Only found one like that so far."
borderlands3,fc5gh2j,t3_eg7r9b,1577456907.0,Generally whenever I encounter a bug I scream at it for some time till the bug still remains.
borderlands3,fc588b7,t3_eg77mk,1577448215.0,"Kinda like the Riven system in Warframe. Highly addictive, mind you. 

Also, I wouldn't mind having a ""leggo grinder"" that gives you the same legendary item but with an Anointed stat. So many legendaries I refuse to pick up because they're useless or uninteresting."
