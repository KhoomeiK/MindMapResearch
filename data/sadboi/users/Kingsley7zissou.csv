They basically handed me the keys, I did all the ordering and scheduling of repairs checked on all the supers and porters every day. Took tenant complaints, cleared building fines. I think you might like that business only because I liked it and you seem quite capable in your writing. I would also negotiate down prices for large orders of supplies and would deal with contractors. I went in with little experience and I am not the best learning but I handled 17 buildings, 18 employees, total 600 units (apartments). I felt like I helped many people, gave people many chances with rent, treated my supers and tenants with a ton of respect. We leased to some people who had no where to go, we did alot of AMI based and section 8 apartments."

The wind, heat, salt water and activity are all dehydrating. Plus Please drive safe after a full beach day really hits you on the drive back home from being tired. Pull over and get a bite to eat or something (when not even having drank anything).
