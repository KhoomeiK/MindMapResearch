It seems like you’re a little fixated on the title of Aunt, and there’s potential it could be a sticking point for other people as well. It’s probably better to focus on building a relationship with your partner’s family and the kid once they arrive. You can be the kids “auntie” in your interactions regardless of what they call you.
