WorldWar2,fimiwzz,t1_filg9c1,1582532274.0,"That's an awesome story! I feel like I can relate to your story... I'm from the Netherlands, my grandfather was about 10 years old during the occupation of our country. When he was young he wanted to become an electrical engineer, when he was 10 he made sure that a lot of jews hiding in their barn would have light as he ran wires and lamps through the place. During the evening he always came in and said ""ladies and gentlemen! The lights will be off now, have a good night!"", amd turn iff the lights. 

My grandfather lived in Arnhem and was in the middle of Operation Market Garden. He always told me lots of stories about the Allies and all the awesome stories they told him or things they showed him. In the end he filled his whole basement with all kinds of stuff the Allies dropped in the forests here (like batteries, rations, etc) and gave it to the Allies when they would come by. He also kept a lot of guns, mortars and all kinds of stuff he would find next to dead germans or left behind by the Germans. His dad found out and called the police and it was all taken away, haha.

He (and his family) later received a letter from Winston Churchill to thank them for all their efforts during the war and to wish them a merry christmas. I have a scanned image of the letter as this was the first E-mail I ever received on my first e-mail (hotmail) account. Maybe I should post it sometime.

During his career as a technician he later became the CEO of Hasler and Osram, two electrical companies that grew so big they were becoming the biggest in the market. I'm in a very technical job now too, as a system engineer. I know I have a lot of his insight and understanding of my work. I'm less than 5 years into this career but I'm always told I will make it to a high position later on. When I was in IT for a year I was appointed as my team's lead even though other had way more experience than I did. I'm pretty sure a lot of good qualities of my grandfather made me the way I am too :) I am so proud of him and miss him a lot, he passed away about 6 years ago. He was the nicest guy I ever got to know."

The way Microsoft asks questions is the hardest part I think, the subjects I had to master were pretty logical to me. I did prepare by reading all MTA books (without cert) first, I even requested and got approval for doing my MTA studies during work days when we were low on tickets. It's a great step in knowledge and understanding everything there is to server-client relations and networking before getting into MCSA Windows Server certifications.

Like Panacea4316 said, the MCSA certification would be a major step up for you. Have faith in yourself and start reading into it asap, you'll be a mile ahead.

Also, you have to be an active shooting club member for years (3.5 years to get military semi automatics i believe). You have to pass several shooting tests before you're allowed to get a permit. In your application the police also wants names of other club members and family who can verify you're a responsible person.

I think you have the wrong idea about snapshots. A snapshot saves the state of a VM at the moment you make it. From that moment, the snapshot keeps track of all changes to the VM, so when you ""roll back"" to the snapshot, it undo's all these changes so the VM is back in the state it was when the snapshot was taken. If that's long ago, you can't just roll back in 10 seconds. Snapshots come in handy when you perform updates or make changes to a server. If the update doesn't work, or something goes terribly wrong, just roll back to a previous moment that did work.

Snapshots eat away a lot of space and aren't really a way of backing up systems. If you catch a virus that ""waits"" for a few weeks in a system before it encrypts everything, rolling back 2 days trough a snapshot doesn't do much: You'll catch the virus again in two days.

I got my bachelor (23 years old) in Physical Education but by the time I was done, no work. I then moved on to becoming a ferry skipper for a few years to earn a living and decide what I wanted to do for a career. I was lucky to run into the CEO of a IT company (I was 25 years old then) and started out in the SysAdmin room (the CEO thought I would be too smart for Helpdesk, lol).

I got really addicted to being able to really make such a big difference in the lives of so many users. I noticed that I could learn way faster than most people in IT and even though I started at 25 y.o., I quickly made progress and climbed the ladder higher than many other who had been doing IT for many more years. I'm 4,5 years into IT now, facing exactly the same problems. I want to keep expanding in every direction like I used to, but it's simply impossible. As things get deeper, you need more time to make serious progress in all IT disciplines.

Now some advice for handling the way you feel and moving on(note to self also :D):

1. Sometimes it's best to realize you've come very far, and it's not expected of you to be able to do everything. That's why big companies have experts in all kind of IT fields/disciplines: It's impossible to get deep in everything at the same time. So stop feeling guilty over that.
2. Don't try diving in too deep right away: Look for oppertunities that lie closer to your day to day work and make choices in what you want to learn. Then just start looking up stuff on it and take your time to practise and get better. Example: When you start looking for PowerShell info, you quickly find many youtube watchlists that help you get better step by step and give you handy information to practise by yourself. It takes time to invest in real skills, you can't just learn how to make advanced scripts overnight."

sysadmin,evoajkh,t3_ckk8ek,1564642152.0,"I started out in IT 4,5 years ago after talking to the owner of a company in IT.. I didn't know he was in IT but I told him I was considering a career change. I just got my bachelor in a different direction (which I didn't want to pursue), for him it showed I was able to take on a challenge and finish it, being capable of learning. He offered me a job, put me in the SysAdmin room and they tought me everything I needed to know to solve some basic tickets/problems. I was allowed to get MS certifications as I pleased and worked myself up to a medior SysAdmin.

I was lucky to find this oppertunity, but in the Netherlands IT is really short of certified people as they often go work abroad for better pay. Right now it's even worse, the demand for IT professionals is going trough the roof. Many companies who can't find people to hire start making their own IT professionals this way.

If you're looking to start somewhere, first think about what you already know and what makes you interesting for them (i.e. knowledge you already have on these subjects, demonstrated capabilities of learning new things, etc). 

Where are you from? This matters a lot on how to get into this job, as different regions in the world have their own problems in which you could be a solution (In my case, not enough people that have the capacities and capabilities to study and get certification)."

Management didn't take it seriously, so I went to the director. I predicted the problems and even the fact that we would lose some customers. It took 2 weeks before hell broke loose, we lost two customers right away. The director acted like nothing happened."
