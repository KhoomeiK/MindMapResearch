Christian,fq8ab1w,t3_ghdi7i,1589161727.0,"This might sound crazy, but questioning your faith is a good and healthy thing. It can strengthen your faith and pull you closer to God, in fact. 


When the disciples were telling Apostle Thomas about how the Lord had risen and that they’d seen him, Thomas was having a hard time believing it. He wasn’t gonna believe until he saw and touched Jesus’ wounds for himself. The awesome part about this story is that Jesus met up with Thomas and let him do just that! (John 20:24-29) 

So, the Lord has compassion and understanding for us in our doubts and welcomes them. The truth is, there’s going to be a lot of doubting during our walk with the Lord but He’s right there with us during those struggles. Try taking those doubts to Jesus. Talk about them with Him, all of it and don’t hold anything back no matter how painful or shameful it might feel. He already knows and He can take it. He’s been patient and loving with my doubts too. If you have any pastor or other trusted older Christians who you can talk to about your struggles with, then definitely take your concerns to them as well and ask for guidance. You’re not alone in this. Peace be with you! ❤️"

I’m dying. I need to go to the ER or I’m gonna die.” But then I remembered all the ER visits that were thanks to panic attacks and anxiety and I went to asleep. I woke up and my muscles were so sore and and my chest still hurt and breathing was still hard to do and getting out of bed to go to work was a struggle but...I didn’t die. And after spending a whole day being shamed for what I’m “doing to myself” and being told to “stop worrying so much”—all while trying to hold onto whatever peace I could—I end up reading this beautiful post and I wanna cry. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I needed this. So much."

You’re also in good company too. The Bible is filled with tooons of people who have messed up and God redeeming them. Even the heroes of the faith like David and Solomon had their own temptations to battle. And like them, you are will stumble and fall but just like a father who picks their baby up off the ground after trying to walk and utterly failing, so will God help you back up after you fail too. There’s going to be a lot of that, unfortunately, and there will be people who will try to make you feel bad about that, but Christ understands and you can always go back to God to get more strength. (Hebrews 4:15) Anyone who is in Christ is new and that includes you too! (2 Corinthians 5:17)
