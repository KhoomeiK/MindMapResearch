Gifted,fpuod0i,t3_gfmdmo,1588918490.0,"I'm not a parent but I work with parents of gifted children and your story sounds similar to others, so yes, this is familiar. Have you heard of SENG or Peers4Parents? You'll be able to find more information on it on the website of Webb. https://www.sengifted.org/smpg (Apparently it's not called Peers4Parents in the USA, that's what the same groups are called in the Netherlands.)

Here you can find what type of support is out there and what might suit your situation. As far as I can judge it from what you've written, you're doing a great job as a parent by taking your child's emotional needs seriously and reading into giftedness as to understand him better. And the apple probably doesn't fall far from the tree, so it might be interesting to reflect on your own youth now and then and talk about that with your partner. Sometimes that can have an influence on the way you handle situations without realising it. 

Hope this helps!"
