abusiverelationships,fpqpwa7,t1_fpptiop,1588828875.0,Amen to that. A fucking men.
abusiverelationships,fpqpvf6,t1_fpqn429,1588828856.0,Thank you. This is so much harder than you could imagine as an innocent child growing up and it sucks not having anyone I know who really understands. Music is a blessing for me. And I’m finding more working out and yoga has me feeling more confident so I’ll continue with that.
abusiverelationships,fpqpq0d,t1_fpq6fvp,1588828740.0,I hope you do find someone. It’s helped me in ways I couldn’t have imagined.
NarcissisticAbuse,ezulgh5,t1_ezsl0yr,1568155045.0,They are wonderful with him and he treats them so well so I know I can’t take them away completely. I was thinking I would take the one that is adopted under my name eventually but now I can’t bear to separate them. Idk what’s going to happen but it’s just so hard going through everything in the aftermath of the breakup without them. Thank you for the kind words.
NarcissisticAbuse,ezulbxc,t1_ezsfhr9,1568154954.0,"Thank you for this. He treats our dogs so well, I have no doubt that they are living a great life with him. I’m just so heartbroken that I think I’m going to lose them. I was originally thinking I would take one of them once I can afford my own place (because it’s my name on the adoption papers) but now I just cannot bear to separate them. I feel guilty getting another dog but that looks like one day it may be my only choice."
emotionalabuse,ez025lm,t1_eydeq6b,1567629025.0,"Trust me, been there done that. It’s hard to come to terms with it but he’s not going to change. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Honestly speaking to people on Reddit about my situation was a big push for me to get into therapy and start talking about everything and helped me realize just how bad it all was. Stay strong, talk to people about this. You’ll eventually realize from the feedback you get that it’s not worth it and you deserve so much better."
abusiverelationships,eydej4e,t3_cwgrtu,1567017226.0,"I realized I was so depressed that either I would end up killing myself if I stayed, or he might end up killing me. Talking to people and saying it out loud changed everything."
abusiverelationships,eydef8v,t1_eyc8tz3,1567017169.0,This!
emotionalabuse,eyde226,t3_cwo6wz,1567016982.0,Really your only option is to get out of that relationship. That’s unhealthy and abusive. It’s also not safe to be making you sleep in your car. Reach out to family or anyone who will listen and help. It’s not worth your mental health to try to make that relationship work. Wish you the best.
depression,ewv07fj,t3_cpvwhh,1565795729.0,I feel like nobody takes my depression seriously because of this and it pisses me off.
EARONS,es0gpi4,t1_erzjes5,1561474880.0,What do you mean the way they talked about his presumed guilt was unprofessional? Just curious
