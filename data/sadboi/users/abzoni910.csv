The other thing is separate and happens at other times- is not really visual at all it’s just a feeling. Like your body is moving through molasses but your thoughts are sped up and screaming in your ears. It’s so weird. 

I totally understand the effect you are talking about- the comet trail- it’s happened to me on drugs before lol. It sounds different from the things I’m trying to describe  but I’ve never paid attention to my hands during one of these events. The brain is so weird."

I’m not an expert in smoking cessation or a therapist- but every moment is an opportunity to practice mindfulness. And you can explore feeling whatever you are feeling in these moments that are difficult. I agree it must be difficult in that these books weren’t written for your exact situation, that must be frustrating. But I would try to apply mindfulness to the situation you are in rather than trying to manipulate yourself into a picture that is in a book or program. All mindfulness is basically the same. It has been very helpful for me in times of difficult physical and emotional struggle. No matter what you do, be kind to yourself and know you can choose to begin again in any moment. Take care."

I’m in my early 30s and just now coming to terms with life long disordered eating and distorted body image.

OCD,fozegzx,t3_gae9vq,1588189298.0,"I have OCD and as someone who is training to be a yoga teacher, I meet all kinds of well meaning people who think they know better than I do. Trusting yourself is hard when you have OCD because it causes you to doubt yourself. I’ve had dear friends say that “yoga is better than medication and therapy” and that “you shouldn’t name your emotions” and to “just think positive thoughts”.  While I believe yoga and mindfulness have been super helpful in my recovery, I know that I need therapy and meds and that I have a medical condition. It’s so difficult when some people don’t buy it. Remember... OCD can’t be reasoned with and will constantly try to get you to doubt yourself. I’ve gone a hundred rounds trying to outthink my OCD and it never helps.(not sure if that makes sense). I find the most helpful thing for me is to not try to convince people who aren’t on board. It can be so difficult to have a close friend who doesn’t see you and your mental health for what is really there, but it can be even harder to feel like you have to prove yourself. Or be told that you aren’t taking care of yourself the “right” way.  I’m not sure if that is helpful, but I’ve had a lot of people give me their opinions on mental health and I’ve had to learn to let it go and trust myself. I bring it to therapy often and work on it there. It’s hard, I’m sorry. 
Be well and take care!"

As you say, there can be numbness that occurs. I might try to clarify with your psych what they mean exactly, but it sounds like they are suggesting to simply “check in” with yourself. To just pause and see what’s there. It sounds like what you are noticing is that there is a numbness. Perhaps you don’t need to find anything else right now? Maybe feelings will be revealed with time. Be well."
pics,foncmlr,t1_fon6kfd,1587916901.0,"The average Joe isn’t walking into a confirmed COVID patient’s isolated hospital room providing direct care. Healthcare workers ARE getting sick and some ARE dying. Most don’t want to be called heroes, but appreciation is called for. Adequate supplies of PPE (finally) is a good thing. Remember, many of the other patients in the hospital are immunocompromised or otherwise ill. The protocols and supplies needed are different than in other workplaces and the general public for a reason. 

On a regular hospital shift, many nurses are so overworked that they skip lunch, so during a pandemic if some restaurant wants to provide lunch for the unit, I think that’s fine. 

I’m so sorry that your job doesn’t have adequate protection. That is terrible, it’s an awful situation. I’m glad that you were able to get some masks. Thank you for working during this time, you are appreciated too!

While I totally understand that 5 star ratings are important to sellers to be seen, etc, I don’t think the general public knows this. As a buyer, there are many factors that go into rating, and everyone does it differently. For example, on GoodReads, I rate a book 3 stars if I liked it. 4 stars if I really liked it and 5 if it is one of my favorite all time books. I know that businesses strive for perfection, but consumers may not believe they are snubbing you when they give you a rating. I believe the content of the review should be taken into consideration. This just seems like a way to get Etsy to have sellers resent their customers. Just my perspective. I don’t think you all are wrong, clearly you are under a lot of pressure. I just think the pressure is coming from the top not the customer."
