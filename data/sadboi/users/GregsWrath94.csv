betterCallSaul,fr5z2tu,t3_gm28jq,1589917072.0,"The banking industry has numerous bodies of regulatory and legal oversight. Anytime a bank wishes to expand, they must get the approval of these bodies, the main one being the Federal Reserve. In order for a bank to expand, they require having a capital position that demonstrates they have a level of liquidity that can support an increase in the level of operations. Financial Institutions operate on fractional reserve banking, which means they are able to loan out capital that is based on the number of consumer deposit accounts. So in order to expand, they have to basically demonstrate that they are in the capital position to support a higher level of output. This is called the FDIC stress test. The firms balance sheet, income statement, and all other prudent financial statements are evaluated, to determine whether they are able to expand operations. While this of course does mostly require accounting specialization, there is also the legal issues involved with interstate commerce. After the Enron and WorldCom scandals in the early 2000s, Financial Institutions and public companies in general, are heavily scrutinized when looking to grow. The most important piece of legislation being Sarbanes-Oxley, signed into law in 2002. Anyway, from here you can clearly see that banks are heavily subject to regulatory oversight, so expanding and investing in new branches is a big deal. It requires legal and accounting professionals to A) Concur with all federal, state, and local laws and B) Determine if the FI is financially sound in order to facilitate a higher level of output. That's why Mesa Verde is such a big deal.

breakingbad,fqxwh85,t3_gliy46,1589738915.0,"So I’m a die hard fan of both, but comparing breaking bad to Star Wars is rather inaccurate. In both regards, they are highly renowned pieces of media. But they have revolutionized the world in a completely different way. 

For one, Star Wars was an entirely original piece of work, that has graduated to world acclaim and numerous pop culture references. I mean, we literally got a day in May called Star Wars day. “Use the Force” “May the Force be with you”....common phrases now. I say that to my friends instead of saying “good luck.” 
“Luke....I am your father” is jokingly repeated by people when they try to mimic lord Vader, even though they’re saying it wrong and it’s “no, I am your father.” Light Sabers, storm troopers, Death Stars 1&2, the millennium falcon, etc....even if someone has never watched Star Wars ever, someone already knows what those items are in reference to....The list can go on. 

Breaking Bad, was ground breaking television. It was epic beyond approach. But it’s roots are dated back to The Sopranos. It has been said numerous times that Walter White is the evolution and product of Televisions most notorious gangster, Tony Soprano. There’s many similarities between the two shows. Alpha dominant white males embark on a life of crime in order to provide for their families, and fulfill their egotistical shortfalls. 
With that said, there aren’t too many references universally associated with breaking bad that can make a non fan associate said reference with the show, like with Star Wars. “Yea bitch!! magnets!!” “I am the danger” etc....unless you’ve watched breaking bad, you’re not gonna know what someone is referring to. At the most, someone can think of Methamphetamine and associate it with the Show, but meth isn’t unique to breaking bad, it’s a narcotic that has been around since the late 1890s. The most unique thing about BB is the blue colored drugs, because In reality, pure methamphetamine is actually white or clear colored. But still, unless you watched the show, you would more than likely not know it’s significance. 

With that said, both BB and SW are in their own rights epic as epic can be. But they are different types of epic"

You can talk about how a reduced workforce in some places eliminate labor costs and the expenses associated with it, such as pensions, insurance, medical, etc. 

Then the cons are things like higher unemployment for those with less marketable skills, or elimination of jobs that have been around for year.

modernwarfare,fncb8lo,t1_fnbdlpb,1586832647.0,"Since you deleted your shit show model using “real time data” and your “hypothetical “ metrics, I figured I’d post my response below anyway. 

Ok ,you clearly didn’t read what I wrote. First off, you’re reading into it as if I said there’s 1 hacker for every two players which is NOT WHAT I SAID. I also said let’s ASSUME every single player were on right now playing. Realistically that’s not possible or the servers would explode. No shit, hence the term ASSUME. Also, you’re using hypothetical numbers ? Dude I’m using actual confirmed figures, so just for that your entire calculation would be flawed. 

Your 120k to 50 mil comparison is irrelevant. My statistical analysis isn’t a ratio of hacker Count to legitimate player it’s HACKER PER GAME LOBBY. Out of 150 players in a game it only takes one player to fuck the whole thing up. 

I used that metric to make the calculations as simple as possible, assuming a fully populated model. Even if we were to divide them up into regions as you said, let’s say there’s 5 regions, that’s still 10 million players per region, so 14,000 hackers per region. 

If there are 10 million players actively playing right now in the North American region, then there are 66,667 active games. Let’s assume for a second it’s all a singles games, so they aren’t on teams. Which btw was the only valid point you actually made, but either way it’s an acknowledgement of a flawed platform. 

Anyway, That’s still a 1/5 chance of a hacker in every game Lobby. So even if we use real time data as you suggest, the law of averages still support my original calculations.  No, I didn’t account for population increases because I am operating off of Activision’s latest data. So if you really want to go by that then we can assume a 5 % margin of error to account for any increases in total player base. As for my “guess” at the rate of increase of hackers, it wasn’t a guess, it was an educated estimate based off of existing numbers. You need only need two points of data to make a trend analysis. If 50,000 hackers have already been caught a few days prior, and the total is 20,000 today, then one can reasonably assert a trend of 20,000 every 3-4 days. It’s really not rocket science. Even if there were 70 million players by the end of next week, you’re still looking at a 35-55% probability of a lobby being compromised. 

Were I to use real time statistics there would Probably be a much more accurate Count, but I again, I am using an aggregate model where we are hypothesizing that every player were to be on right now. Either way, the law of averages would support my initial analysis. 

Either way you look at it, there is a cheating problem on this game. All statistics aside, call of duty has confirmed it, so it doesn’t matter how right or wrong either of our maths are, which btw, I checked with a statistician friend beforehand, so your assumption of my calculation being flawed, is in itself flawed."
modernwarfare,fnc4zt5,t1_fnbdocp,1586828743.0,"Please read my empirical analysis below and then tell me that the game isn’t broken. Sources include Call of duty’s main Facebook , and basic math"
modernwarfare,fnc06c5,t1_fnbdlpb,1586825858.0,"Ok bruh, you really wanna get technical. Let’s get fucking technical: 

Call of duty  just announced on their Facebooks main page that they’ve already banned over 70,000 accounts for cheating. So there’s bound to be more. 

Now, let’s assume that right now, all 50 million players just happen to be online playing warzone. 

150 players per lobby divided into the 50,000,000 players that Activision claims to be signed up= 333,333 games being played. 

70,000/333,333 = .21

So that’s a 21% chance just as of TODAY that at any given moment you’re playing with a hacker. But wait, I’m not finished! There’s fucking more!! 

And that 70,000 is a 20,000 increase from the 50,000 figure reported 3 days ago, which means there are WAY more hackers out there. 

So if the rate of hackers being caught is 20,000 every three days, that means in approximately 15-20 days, roughly 170,000 thousand players would have been caught cheating. 170,000/333,333=.51 Aka 51%

So there’s my 50% figure. It’s not something I pulled out of my ass, it’s based off of my personal observations, the observations of other players, Activision’s confirmation that hackers do indeed exist in their own servers, and a little bit of basic arithmetic, you can see how I came up with that 50% metric. Assuming you weren’t totally shit at math in school. 

Now, while I’m REALLY glad they are doing something to address the issue, they got a lot of damn work to do. But please by all means, continue on with your idiocy about how there is nothing wrong with the game whatsoever."

It was an extension of a game that probably 80% of the players paid for, which also has its problems,that is inaccessible unless updating it. There is NOTHING free about it."

But in any case depending on the state you’re in, it only tests for typical drugs like marijuana, cocaine, opiates, etc. kratom is none of the above, therefore it won’t show up on a UA, unless it’s specifically tested for, which takes a lot of time and money."

He stays clean, he stays out of trouble, he is free. Simple as that. Anything else is a violation of that contact, and most importantly a violation of his civil rights. 

Well, with any luck it will be dismissed early. I found a page where a bunch of paroles and probationary individuals are celebrating their early release. Lucky fucks lol"

probation,fn1lck3,t3_fmjaxt,1586564472.0,"My cousin is facing a similar situation. He received a 6 month CD back in January. His original date for submitting to a test was in third week of March. After calling the probation office to confirm if the appointment was still happening, he was informed it got pushed to April 28th, which he did receive a letter for in the mail. He called back the same day asking if he could go to his primary physician and do a urinalysis with the physician, and then email it, along with the signed CD agreement, which they said is fine, AND which is written in the paper sent by the court. 

He emailed his PO the test results, and signed affidavit, to which he received no response. He emailed it again, and has called the PO office everyday, as well as the court, and left numerous voice messages. He has not received any notification regarding whether or not his April 28th appointment is still happening or not. He's scared that he will be in violation of his parole, due to the lack of communication the courts end. Furthermore, I am being told on another Reddit post that he has to see a judge at the end of this, which means due to the obvious huge backlog of cases, his sentence will be extended. I don't know how true that is, because his sentencing predates the shutdown of of the courts, and it is a written court order that its from January ## to July ##. This is such a fucked up time for everything."
Advice,fn1jtap,t1_fn1jek4,1586563521.0,"I pray that is not the case. His sentence was issued this already happened. Which means by the time of July, he  has essentially paid his debt to society. Wouldn’t an extension of a sentence he already received violate his constitutional rights ? The paper clearly says “January ## 2020 to July ## 2020”."
Advice,fn1fzrd,t1_fn1ev5h,1586561226.0,"Trust me bud i know the feeling of void and loneliness. You go 20 something years and see all your peers go from relationship to relationship, hook ups and one night stands, to getting married, and here you (I am) nearing our 30s with no meaningful relationship. Social media certainly doesn’t help. The only thing I can offer you in terms of solid advice, is not simply not think about it. When that thought crosses my head, I just shake it off. Girls never paid me any attention, so one day I just woke up and got tired of paying them it back. I’ve dwelled over girls I’ve been into who’ve never given me a second thought. Dating apps were a total waste of my time and made me feel shittier about myself than when I was struggling to talk to girls. 

And no, I’m not angry at the women in this case; I’m not the typical sexually frustrated white male who blames women for my problems. Ain’t their faults. You can’t force feelings. Maybe it’s me, maybe it’s them, I don’t know and I never will know. 

All I can say is that you need to occupy yourself with other ventures. It’s probably not solid advice and it won’t fill your void, but it’s a distraction, and an outlet for everything that you’re feeling. For me, it’s video games, and focusing on becoming an accountant. I hope this helped and if it didn’t, I’m sorry 😐"

Does he have to see a judge at the end of his sentence ? From what he told me that the lawyer told him and me (I went to court with him on the day of his case) once he is done with his sentence, that’s pretty much it, he’s free. How do these conditional discharges usually ends ? His sentence very clearly marks a beginning date and end date, as it is in writing which he has a copy of.

It makes sense that since courts are closed his probation officer can’t be reached, but what happens in July when his sentence is done?"

legaladvice,fn18m1d,t1_fn187n3,1586556961.0,"Well in any case, like I said you have numerous parties asserting the same fact, this was a stay at home order, not paid time off. I think you and your co workers should at the least consult an employee attorney. If it was just you by yourself, I’d tell you unfortunately it would be very difficult to prove in court that this was the case. I mean, it’s just suspicious as fuck that by any judge “what employee wouldn’t do a single thing about the entire staff taking off AT THE SAME TIME?” When I used to work If I was even 20 minutes late to work my managers calling me asking if I’m on my way. I can’t imagine you can just take an entire week off and come back to work, in a normal place of business you’d be fired"

legaladvice,fn17ykc,t1_fn17ars,1586556587.0,"Ok, so what’s already sketchy is the fact that no reasonable employer would do absolutely nothing if THE ENTIRE STAFF didn’t just show up to work for an entire week. During this time of being forced to stay home, was there ANY Communication, phone call or email asking any of you guys “where the hell are you?” There is No chance in hell a manager would just ignore the fact their entire team didn’t show up to work for a week. It’s also not viable to have multiple personnel take off at the same tome; after all whose doing the work? Was there anything in writing about you guys having to stay home until you got your medical test back? It already seems like you got multiple witnesses to confirm the fact this wasn’t a leisure time off, but writing, email, whatever, is always rock solid evidence."
legaladvice,fn17029,t3_fypsse,1586556040.0,"Ask your co workers if anyone else received something similar, or at the very least have them confirm that they got the same stay at home order. Your companies trying to avoid paying you, and probably other employees, for that week you were off. They want to make it seem like you took it as a personal vacation. It’s total bullshit and they have grounds for being sued. You get multiple people to confirm it was NOT a vacation, and you have a solid case."
