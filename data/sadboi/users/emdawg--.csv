This overdressing can suggest that the individual hasn‚Äôt taken the time to understand the company or it‚Äôs culture. Some bosses might only see it as a good effort, but that‚Äôs hard to predict. In OP‚Äôs case, I‚Äôd guess a suit would probably be well suited for their partner‚Äôs interview, given the type of job and industry.

That can result in multiple personalities, among other things. Schizophrenia is more to do with paranoid, fantastical thinking and a detachment from reality. It is sometimes described as a form of psychosis. It doesn‚Äôt result in any split personality parts. I say this not to have a go, but because I think open discussion of mental health is important, and we should aim to understand it as best we can. (I double checked my own statements on the NHS website before posting.)

Either way, I wouldn‚Äôt draw a comparison with either of these. Riddle‚Äôs issues were already pretty firmly set before he made the decision to tear his soul to pieces. I can see where you got your idea, though. :)"
