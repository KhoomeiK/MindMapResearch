I know people dont like to hear it.... But..... Meditation really helps with this disease. Consider it a challenge to think of absolutely nothing and continue that clear state of mind into satisfaction and happiness. 
It is very difficult. It is frustration at its finest. But in the end meditation saved me from a life of misery. 


I hope you all have a great day tomorrow and be safe out there!

Remind yourself that we are all different. 
You may be better at one thing while others are better than you at other things. 

Also keep in mind which strains you are smoking. Sativa can be great to relax and unwind but keep some energy.  Conversely , smoking too much can get you *out there* and for me sometimes even paranoid.  Indica and indica dominant hybrids are great bedtime choices for me.  Or to relax after a days work.  Something we all have to keep in mind while living with BPD 1 or 2. 
Everything in moderation.
