But I never cross a line (I think?) like if I ever tell her how much I care I start it out with *""Look I know you're a provider & I'm just a client But...""*  I've never broken a rule or stepped over a boundary, nor would I expect free service.

The other one is my age, has some problems, needs someone to treat her well so I do. one time she told me about some issues she has and I told her she could talk to me anytime and she went into the bathroom and began to cry. I felt like total s&\^% but nobody treats her like a person so when someone does she gets emotional about it. I love and care for her, bring her lunch, sometimes just hold her and let her sleep in my arms after I give her a Massage with no funny business. She needs that, and I would never cross a line or expect free service.
