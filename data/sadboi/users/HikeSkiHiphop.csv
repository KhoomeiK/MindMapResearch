BipolarReddit,fqmvmgh,t3_gjsm23,1589484277.0,"A lot of times I feel like trying to pull myself out of the depression is kind of in vain. I’ve been trying to adopt a mind of living at peace with the depression. Or I like to think about it like I’m trying to make friends with someone I really don’t like. Now I use the term friend super loosely. For me the relationship could more accurately be described kind of like the co-worker that I don’t like working with. To conceptualize the depression my co-worker I needed to first detach myself from the depression but that doesn’t mean pushing it away or hiding from it. What it does mean is I needed to sit with my feelings. Figuring out where I stop and where depression starts. From there I can start to see what depression tells me to do. I can see how with depression as my co-worker, things aren’t running the way I want them to in the job of life. From there I can make opposite action plans. “When my depression tells me to do X, I’ll do Y”. 

A very real Iteration of one of those opposite action plans is that my depression tells me that cooking is too much energy and that I should just get food that’s easily accessible. But I know that I really like cooking. Cooking is therapeutic for me. I can get caught up in the process and enjoy the results that come from the hard work. So my opposite action plan looks like this; “when my dumbass co-worker depression tells me that I don’t have energy to cook tonight, I say okay cool, we’ll eat something quick and easy tonight but tomorrow I’m gonna structure my day tomorrow so that cooking a balanced and involved meal happens.”

In doing that I recognized that my friend or dumbass co-worker- Whichever you wanna call the depression- wants me to cut corners. I’m really stuck in this job with my co-worker so I’ll listen to it today but I know that I’m gonna have to go to work with that co-worker again tomorrow and I wanna do a better job tomorrow so I’m gonna tell my depression, that co-worker, that we’re cooking tomorrow before he can tell me to not cook."

confession,fnh6can,t3_g1gkke,1586955931.0,"When I was 13 my friend and I smoked cinnamon sticks and drank beers then at 14 we were on to cigarettes and liquor and dip. By 15 we were smoking weed as well as all the other things. 16 I started experimenting with other drugs. Pills, etc. 17 I was expelled (later reinstated because of some BS) from my high school for bringing and sharing drugs on an overnight school trip. 18 came and I was smoking weed and cigarettes every day and drinking quite often. This continued as I started college where the drinking became more and more accessible. All this recreational substance use got in the way of me making real friends that didn’t just care about my drugs. It prevented me from being able to focus on my classes and get any kind of decent grades or learn as much as I could. I got to the point by age 20 where I couldn’t go without smoking weed. I was high all the time from 20-23 when I got cannabinoid Hyperemesis syndrome and spent a week throwing up and had to be hospitalized twice to make sure I didn’t get too dehydrated. Since then (I’m 25 now) I’ve quit smoking weed three times and relapsed twice (I’m still going strong on this time quitting). My drinking habits are starting to be concerning to me and I recognize that I really never learned how to drink responsibly because you can’t be responsible with alcohol when you start that young. I don’t really do drugs at this point (save but a few specific things at very specific times).

Anyway, I share all of this to say that if I hadn’t become so fixated on substances so young, it’s likely I would have saved myself a lot of heartache and difficulties. It’s likely that I’d be able to go grab a beer with friends without feeling like I risk going overboard. I would have gotten a lot more out of my education and been able to spend time with the people who cared about me not about my drugs. 

I urge you, OP, slow down this road your on before you end up a 25 year old with a lot of habits to break or fight."
