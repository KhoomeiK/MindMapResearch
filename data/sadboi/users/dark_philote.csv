Keep in mind what kind of pharmacy you want to work for; if you're thinking of doing straight retail then I would reconsider going to school to be a tech. Most retail pharmacies offer on the job training. I would definitely get your state certification and maybe start studying up for the national ptcb test, but aside from 5hat most retail pharmacies go through so much turn over that finding a job shouldn't be hard. As long as you can take direction and multi task, you'll be great and you won't have a tuition to pay off.

Regardless, hope everything goes well for you!"
