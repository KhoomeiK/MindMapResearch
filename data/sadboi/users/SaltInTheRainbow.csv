travel,f2cmy5t,t3_dcovhe,1570140064.0,"I visited Sigonella for 10 days in July 2001. As a Navy family we flew there for free. We spent a lot of time in Taormina and Messina. 18 years ago it didn‚Äôt feel touristy to me, just slow and hot and relaxed. The Ionian Sea was purple and I loved the ancient town. Tried to find my grandmother‚Äôs parents house in Tripi but failed. Actually was driving up Etna the day it started erupting again. Didn‚Äôt even know it til halfway up the carabinari turned everyone back. You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be aware you were on an erupting volcano, but no, the smoke was white and looked like clouds. Later that night tho we were back on base and decided to goto the Irish Pub (absurd yes) across the street and danced the night away. Dancefloor was open area and up above there in the not-to-distance was the hot red orange ‚ÄúS‚Äù shape of lava headed our way. Truly surreal night.  Our flight out was delayed 3 hours as we watched 2 firetrucks spray water all over the Air Italia plane to remove the volcanic ash. Luckily we missed our connection so the airline put all of us up in a hotel in Rome for the night, free pasta, free red wine. So that was a freebie quickie in Rome. Had a great night wandering Rome with all that wine. Never got lost despite no maps or GPS. It was my 2nd time there, but to be there completely unexpected  like that just made it that much more exciting. If I ever get back to Sicily, I‚Äôm headed for Palermo and the Capuchin Monastery Catacombs. The Parisian catacombs were amazing, but the Capuchin one is off the charts unreal. Plus, who can deny the food!"
AdviceAnimals,f2cc9v5,t3_dcq3tn,1570136518.0,"This is the general idea about how I got my car. I was in the market for a new car and I was test driving a Nissan something or other SUV type thing. And I liked that a lot and the salesman told me to go and try a Jeep of the same category as what I was trying in the Nissan. He said ‚Äòyou‚Äôll hate it and you‚Äôll come back and you‚Äôll see why this car is better‚Äô. I took his advice, I went and test drove the Jeep. And after I bought it I make sure to drive back to the Nissan dealership and thank the salesman for sending me to the Jeep dealer."
