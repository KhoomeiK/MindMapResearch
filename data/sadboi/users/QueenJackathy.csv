-US ranked 37th most efficient by the WHO


https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/#item-amenable-mortality-measured-by-healthcare-access-and-quality-index-2016

-The US ranks last among economically comparable countries for its healthcare system’s ability to save lives for conditions that are easily treatable


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/what-country-spends-most-healthcare.asp

- Despite the US having consistently low-ranking healthcare compared to countries with similar economic capabilities, Americans spend more money on healthcare than any other country in the world by any measure.

-In fact, it’s so expensive that almost half of Americans have refused to see a doctor because they are afraid of the price. Just because it’s more expensive doesn’t make it better quality. Actually, the higher the healthcare costs the lower the quality, considering that more and more people won’t be able to afford treatment. If people can’t get treatment it’s a bad healthcare system. 


https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/

-this link shows that compared to countries with comparable economies, the US ranks last while simultaneously spending about double the cost per capita than most countries on this list

-“The U.S. ranked last on performance overall and ranked last or near last on the Access, Administrative Efficiency, Equity, and Health Care Outcomes domains.”"

At the same time we just came out of a recession, which rural areas in the US still haven’t recovered from. Rural areas still had less job opportunity in 2016 than before the recession while cities had more job opportunities than before the recession. So rural areas felt left behind and saw their jobs go away either due to the recession or outsourcing. At the same time, millions of refugees came to the US. And capitalism tells you not to blame company leaders if you lose your job, so instead of being mad at owners and CEOs, rural conservatives blame all the new types of people they see moving into their neighborhood because of their deep-seated racism. This is what I suspect is the case in the US at least but I’m not expert so correct me if I’m wrong."

Monsanto has a monopoly and anybody who buys their seeds cannot replant them. They have to toss the new seeds and re-purchase them from Monsanto or else their lives get ruined. 

Also the water bottle industry. Bottled water tends to be more polluted than tap water in the US, but I believe in the 70s the bottled water industry had a massive propaganda campaign that their water was cleaner. In reality, bottle water companies go to the same sources where people get their tap water, but they have very good lawyers so it’s legal. They just pump tap water which causes water restrictions in local communities and bottle it to sell. Get a reusable water bottle!

Also, the wedding/engagement ring industry. It’s said you’re suppose to spend about 2-3 months salary on a ring. This wasn’t the case until the early 1900s they started a propaganda campaign that if you’re getting a ring it has to be a diamond. This is a recent belief. Diamonds aren’t suppose to be as expensive either, theres just 1-2 companies who have ownership of most diamond mines and they hold back product to raise prices.

Side note- take some time to read about how big of a role grocery stores played in the cold war. Super interesting!

But yeah Reagan was so popular that it was the first time a party handed off the seat to their own party through an election in a long time. His vice president, george hw bush, saw the end of the soviet union. People felt like conservatism was the means to destroy the soviet union and at the same time clinton won on an American centrist platform, which in most countries is a conservative platform. 
After reagan cut taxes on the rich for his trickle down economics plan, clinton and even obama kept them at around the same place. At the same time we’ve seen wealth inequality continue to grow since reagans tax cuts as the democrats have have shifted to right in order to appeal to voters post-Reagan. 

Tdlr: Reagan putting enough pressure on the USSR made him very popular so the Democrats shifted right to appeal to those voters and they havent really moved back to left since. (The establishment democrats, at least)"

Would there be a government? How would an anarchist society deal with somebody who managed to get enough leverage to gain coercive authority over other people? Would there be law in anarchist society?
Anarchism,fl9y3ut,t1_fkzdqy4,1584972266.0,What would happen to people like Jeffery Epstein in an Anarchist society considering there wouldn’t be anybody who could punish him by any means other than ostracizing him? Would there be a government? How would an anarchist society deal with somebody who managed to get enough leverage to gain coercive authority over other people?

WhitePeopleTwitter,fl9sssa,t1_fl97m3a,1584968261.0,"LMAOOOO. Do YOU have a basic understanding of economics? First of all, if you actually read what I said instead of tunnel-vision focus on calling other people out on Reddit you would notice that I said exactly what you said. I said they use it to gain more wealth and power AKA stocks and bonds which is where almost all of their net worth is...which is why we should have a high capital gains tax for high-income individuals and businesses. Also, “thank them for the opportunity to make money” just makes me feel kinda bad for you. You either are a rich person who gets mad when people say that the system works in your favor Or you fell for American propaganda. Just keep working low wage jobs in poor working conditions. Just keep taking out loans to start businesses because in America you can be like one of the billionaires!! Just keep buying their price-gouged medicine. It’ll be fine because of course your income will go up!! If you get a job your quality of life will definitely get better! Your financial successes are due to the ultra-wealthy, so make sure to appreciate them and all the good they do for you every pay day! 
Everything’s fine!"

Someone with 400 MIL can still get a mansion, a mega yacht, private schooling for their children, helicopters, multiple private planes, multiple million-dollar sports cars, a cushy retirement and STILL HAVE MILLIONS LEFT OVER. Anybody who has money above that usually either use it to gain more wealth/power or small philanthropy. Of course philanthropy is good but we would have way more money to fund social programs if we didn’t trust the billionaires to be philanthropic and guarantee the money is spread evenly"

Ask_Politics,fl6gcdz,t1_fl61b7z,1584867591.0,"People always ask how we’re gonna pay for universal healthcare. Well, how are we paying for healthcare now? Instead of giving at least 36 trillion dollars to private companies over the next ten years we can give 32 trillion to the government in order to assure everybody had access. I do get why some people think it won’t work, however. Government’s can do it, as 32/33 industrialized countries do, but the US is government is uniquely fantastic at inefficiency and fucking over their citizens, so I wouldn’t be too surprised if it’s not very efficient but at least it will have a human incentive rather than a profit incentive"
Ask_Politics,fl5prtx,t1_fl52za9,1584842612.0,"Damn this was a good response...it seems like the argument for universal healthcare is to standardize it to assure everybody has healthcare and can afford it rather than arguing it will be higher quality care. Private insurance companies are more flexible and adaptable so they may be more efficient in a lot of ways because they’re less restricted by law and policy compared to government agencies and can react quicker to certain needs, but at the end of the day they’re a company and getting revenue must be their first priority in order to stay afloat. Government get’s revenue through taxes, so even though taxes may go up at least people will be able to get care without going bankrupt or spending all of their savings. So the argument seems more to be about the assurance of healthcare rather than the overall quality, but at the same time million of people wouldn’t have been able to afford it so assurance also means better quality care."
Anarchism,fkywel2,t1_fkyug96,1584657569.0,"What do you think about worker owned businesses? Would people with a longer tenure get a higher salary? Would there be one person who has to decide if a vote was fair? Wouldn’t some decisions have to be divided up, such as buying new office supplies because voting for everything would stall too much?

I honestly don’t know much about worker owned businesses but they seem really great from what I’ve heard but I’m still left with some questions"
