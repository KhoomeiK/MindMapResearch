Vegan Bacon
Ingredients:
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp maple syrup 
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder 
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil for pan frying

Instructions
The number one most important step is to use bananas that are very ripe (which are perfect if you’re also making banana bread). To prepare the banana peels: remove the peels from the bananas and tear into about 4 strips per banana. Use a spoon to lightly scrape off the white inside part of the banana peel leaving just the peel (this is what I kept aside for the mask). 
Make the marinade by mixing the soy sauce, maple syrup, smoked paprika, and garlic powder together in a small bowl. Add the banana peels and toss to coat. Let marinade for a minimum of 10 minutes, but as long as a few hours.
When ready to cook the bacon, heat the oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. When hot add the peels and fry a couple of minutes per side, until they are golden and bubble up a little. Don’t wait till they look crispy - just like regular bacon, if it looks done in the pan, then it will be burnt when it cools. Remove from pan and drain on paper towel. They will get crispier as they cool."

PlantBasedDiet,ey5z6d3,t1_ey5jweo,1566843724.0,"So I don’t mind eating the same thing everyday, but my wife hates it. Meal prep is much harder going completely out of the way to make different meals, so I’ve figured out ways to mix it up, without changing the meal itself. 

If I’m making roasted vegetables, I’ll mix them up with oil/salt/pepper, then lay them all out on a large pan. Once they are flat, I just season  by section - different flavor for everyday. I can then put that in the oven while rice is cooking, and while both those are doing their thing, I’ll make salad “base” which is just whatever
greens I’ve bought that week. Then I just take mason jars and fill them with whatever protein I feel like that week. If it’s beans/lentils, those were prepped and on the stove before the rice and roasted vegetables. If it’s nuts, then they just go straight in. It all maybe takes and hour and a half, but by the end of it you’ve got potentially: roasted vegetable salad, corn and bean salad, nuts and berries salad, beans and rice with roasted vegetables, and depending on how much rice you made, a good base to a soup which can be put in a crockpot for overnight cooking of the scraps. That’s just a basic example - I do this kind of meal prep with ramen/udon soups, grilled dishes, and basically anything that the basic ingredients are the same, it’s just a flavor profile you’re changing."

Anxiety,ewfcikz,t3_cny99g,1565357477.0,"First of all, I am so proud of you. Planning anything in advance and taking the chance on inviting people to an event is *stressful*. 

Second, I entirely empathize. I have felt this way soooo many times. My personal brand of anxiety fuels me to plan *everything*, and tends to cause a natural isolation from whatever group I'm in. As the person always doing the planning, I know I tend to put a lot of expectation on being a polite attendee. Making sure I R.S.V.P. in advance, buying and bringing a host gift, showing up on time, and just generally supporting whoever is throwing the party/soiree. The problem with this anxiety fueled expectation, is that most people are not this in their heads about everything. They just think of it as another thing. Which is totally fine, but hard (for me at least) to wrap your head around. It's especially stressful when you attend multiple successful events with all these people, and then they don't show up for your own. 

I went to college out-of-state, and I have a summer birthday as well. For my 21st, I was so excited to be able to come home, and throw a party. I invited tons of people, who R.S.V.P.'d yes by the way, and got everything ready to go. Literally, and I mean that word literally, all but 2 of the 30 people who R.S.V.P.'d canceled the day of, some canceling 2 hours before. As you could expect with anxiety, I spiraled. I made some pretty crappy choices that night I won't indulge here, but you can probably assume they were 21 year old, sad, drunk girl choices. Afterwards though, I had time to reflect. The two people that did show up had a wonderful time, they invited some of their other friends, we played games, danced, made utter fools of ourselves and anyone that wasn't me would have told you it was a great party. 

The moral of the story is that you've already had a huge success by taking this chance. So, for that one friend that does show up, have fun with them. It isn't a reflection of you that people can't come. I still get anxiety about hosting events, and it still stings when less people than expected come, but I've found that being present for those that do show up makes all the difference in how I internalize the experience. 

I wish you all the best."

I’m trying the Bartlett translation out this time around, but I think if you like it so far then keep on!"
thehemingwaylist,eut8fcw,t1_eut2alr,1564021852.0,I hadn’t thought of that - I read that as an outside observer. I just assumed that they would side with him because he’s the man of the house.
thehemingwaylist,euclpxh,t3_cfnbk9,1563678766.0,"The most memorable part of the chapter for me was when the Silent man said he didn’t know why he was there and Apollyon insisted that the Silent Man knew exactly why he was in the prison. It’s the prevailing theme to me - the paranoia of those who have the power leading their logic rather than factual evidence. It’s not hard to imagine the truth in that situation.

On a side note, I was doing some biographical perusing and B. lived until the ripe old age of 100 dying in 1997."
thehemingwaylist,eucl33i,t1_eubzrv9,1563678214.0,Yeah B wasn’t fully released from prison until 2 months after cummings.

thehemingwaylist,etvzn0r,t3_cdli6p,1563249128.0,"Wow, so I actually have a lot on my mind with part I of Chapter 10.

First, have we discussed the use of Delectable Mountain? It’s really grating to me - and I think it’s the most jarring thing for me because I have no earthly idea what it refers to. I looked it up and Google just returned a bunch of hits about a quilt store????  Then I found some references to Pilgrim’s Progress where they discuss the Delectable Mountains representing the church from the vantage point of a more mature Christian. How does that apply to what cummings is trying to portray? 

Surplice was also a strange reference to me. It seems like an especially involved nickname, and wouldn’t be something that would just come to mind when dolling out personality based tributes. 

I really feel for this character. I’m surprised to feel actual anger towards cummings, but I really loathe how he portrays Surplice. I’m imagining this guy that gets disgusting from cleaning up other people’s waste - in effect keeping the shared space clean - who then does nothing but exist only to be ridiculed and tormented by other people because psychologically we all want to bully people after we’ve been bullied. It also sounds like Surplice just doesn’t know the other languages being spoken around him very well and how awful is that!? You can’t really understand what people are saying, you stay away from the women out of actual (I’m assuming) respect, and you wait to be last for everything, only to be treated like a nuisance. I’m sure we’ve all been there with that person that just tries way to hard to gain approval, but I just can’t shake the feeling that Surplice isn’t as needy as cummings makes him out to be. Thoughts?

As an aside, the reference to going to le masse for le masse really hit home for me. I am prior military and in basic training Sundays meant church, which meant sitting down with no one telling you to stay awake, and boy did you see a bunch of people become “good Christians” for 6 weeks.   Made me chuckle probably a little more than it was actually worth."
thehemingwaylist,etvxvhz,t1_etv2yh2,1563247645.0,I read this chapter for this exact reason. I feel like I lose way too much trying to listen to it.

thehemingwaylist,et64yl3,t3_c9vdg0,1562503940.0,"I think this was a difficult chapter to wrap my head around. I agree with the sentiments that there doesn’t seem to be much of a plot.

I have been curious about the choice of books from Hemingway; the use of French phraseology or French influence as a literary device seems to be pretty prevalent in what we’ve read so far. For Dostoevsky, it makes sense as at that time French was spoken amongst the elite of Russian society. I’ve seen it before in other works of literature. Notably (but not a book we will read) is A Tale of Two Cities bounces between French and English.  I can’t find anything that speaks to why French specifically gets used - or is it just what I’ve been exposed to? Do other languages get used as a literary device? My best guess is the idea that it is a stab at Euphony (use of phrases with notable loveliness). 

If Cummings is going for Euphony, I definitely feel like he’s missed the mark - French is a beautiful language - if you can pronounce it. There are so many dropped syllables and sounds that if you aren’t familiar with it, reading it aloud is more chunky than pleasurable. But Hemingway spent time in Paris, so it probably worked on him. 

Ah, more about this chapter...

I like that it slowed down a little - it’s a stark contrast to day 1 - and begins to show us the monotony. There isn’t really a plot line to being in a detainment center if you think about it. Everyday is pretty much the same. It is not as fun to read, but it’s likely realistic to what e.e. Cummings was going through."
todayilearned,et5etfa,t1_et3lwab,1562471788.0,The fact that I had to scroll this far down to even see the book referenced is really disappointing.
thehemingwaylist,esqz8ye,t3_c8p142,1562212989.0,"It seems to me that e.e. Cummings just wants to make best friends with everyone he meets, and enjoy his travels. 

If I didn’t know better I’d say he’s covering up a significant amount of fear. Reading this almost makes me feel like he’s on the edge of hysteria. u/AnderLouis_ pointed out that a response to trauma can be to make light of things. I really feel this here, especially as cummings intimates how friendly he got with his guardians only to see them straighten up and act as if nothing happened. It makes sense to me that he got stuck in this position. If everyone he speaks with continues like this where they hear that he’s just a good friend, tell him that he won’t be kept long, but then go by the letter of the law of whatever orders they have, it’s like a trap that constantly taunts you. It would feel to me like a mirror maze - you think you’ve headed in the right direction and then you run face first into the plexiglass. (I apologize if this reference goes over anyone’s head - mirror mazes are standard fare in American carnivals but I’m not sure about elsewhere) 

My favorite line(s) is when he talks about the coffee server. 

 “Of all the very beautiful women whom I had seen the most very beautiful was the large and circular lady who sold a cup of perfectly hot and genuine coffee for two cents, just on the brink of the station, chatting cheerfully with her many customers. Of all the drinks I ever drank, hers was the most sacredly delicious. She wore, I remember, a tight black dress in which enormous and benignant breasts bulged and sank continuously.” 

First of all, I’m obviously immature because the idea of fawning over a heaving bosom in the middle of a prison transport tickles me to pieces.

Secondly, I can absolutely appreciate exactly how amazing this cup of coffee must have felt in all this confusion. Just a piece of normalcy in an otherwise chaotic situation."
