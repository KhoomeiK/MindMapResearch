changemyview,fkjoowj,t3_fikoin,1584253106.0,"I moved to the US from the UK and also spent a majority of my teenage years in Bangladesh. Sure, the US is better than most developing countries. However, if you consider the fact that America is upheld on a pedestal for the rest of the world- by both Americans and people abroad- what I've seen and experienced here gives me no reason why this country should be put on a pedestal. While Americans are not blind to the flaws of their country, predominantly they think it's the best country in the world. This indoctrination itself could be seen as a problem- a perceived notion of America being the closest to Utopia. And frankly- maybe it is more of a dystopia- even if other countries are more dystopian."

Anxiety,fj6m9da,t3_fbt8eq,1583075386.0,I'm going to be all alone in my house for the majority of next week since my husband will be starting a new job. He worked remotely before. I'm just starting to realise how I will feel even more alone than I already do. Trying to focus on improving myself to get a job too but it's pretty difficult.
Anxiety,fj6lr8b,t3_fbq6n2,1583075073.0,"Ouch- this hit a little too close too home. I know exactly what you mean. I recently moved to a different country to live with my husband and am quickly realizing how my whole social life was pretty much the family I left behind. I struggle to make myself get out and about and haven't made any new friends- yet one can't help but see how incredibly isolating this life is. Not quite sure how to fix it myself, but I find trying to keep myself busy is one way to deal with it - even if it is a temporary fix."
Anxiety,f43jxq9,t3_dj0b5n,1571342557.0,So glad for you!
books,f3oa7n2,t3_dhgug9,1571012484.0,Relate to this so much. Feel like I'm still stuck in the whole distracted and not reading stage though... I occasionally can make myself get interested in a book enough but after I've read it I don't read for ages. And I feel like I retain a lot less than I used to when I was real reader- feel like I can't get as absorbed in books as I would before.
