Professors,fosd51h,t1_fos4gb8,1588028383.0,"Do you want to see some of the emails students send us? Also, you're not paying thousands to your professors. Do some research on where your tuition money goes. I'm not condoning the professor's response. I would never talk to a student that way, but your position is way off base."
Professors,fosbkwz,t3_g93gcy,1588027526.0,"Ever? Yes. Every time I teach research methods, which is basically every semester."
90DayFiance,forx3q1,t1_for656d,1588020038.0,Yes! It's especially confusing because my impression was she was traveling to Australia to be with James.  She was posting pictures with him on social media until about 6 or 7 months ago. Nothing about this Erica relationship adds up.
90DayFiance,foqlkto,t3_g90jy7,1587996209.0,"I just started catching up on this season, and was actually shocked to see Stepanka with a woman.  I used to watch her YouTube videos back in the day, and: A. Her YouTube personality is a completely 180 from what she's like on the show (on her channel she seemed like kind of a party girl), and B. She was \*always\* interested in men on her channel.  One thing that is consistent is her desire for fame, so it's not too surprising to see her taking advantage of the opportunity for her 15 minutes on TV."
AmItheAsshole,fooslp9,t1_foon5gg,1587945586.0,"My first thought was this must have been in a very conservative community. I mean even the policy told her to change, just to avoid conflict? The neighbor should have been cited for wasting the police's time."
AskStatistics,foorpf9,t1_foohvz0,1587945043.0,"Definitely a paired samples t-test, as other person said. I also recommend downloading Jamovi, https://www.jamovi.org/ for a more user-friendly interface to R (it's 100% free, and very easy to figure out)."
AskStatistics,foofncj,t3_g8n02a,1587938100.0,can you share a little more detail about your data and what software you have access to?
newyorkcity,foo2lp9,t1_foo04xc,1587931275.0,Looks good. Which recipe did you use the chicken?
newyorkcity,fonrzna,t1_fonpybz,1587925311.0,"I agree. Some areas do look very different (like the LES), but others look exactly the same way today, minus the old cars."
