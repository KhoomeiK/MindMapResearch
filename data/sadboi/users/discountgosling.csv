SuicideWatch,eztbp2p,t3_d25lm0,1568126478.0,I'm thinking maybe it was a lot for her to handle too. Either way that's not your fault and sounds unprofessional of her to do so. Please try calling again or venting on here if you need.
SuicideWatch,ez42ifb,t1_ez3lw34,1567679818.0,"^ Maybe that's exactly what you need? Maybe keeping all your problems in your head is hard and heavy and you just want someone to listen to it all and help you sort it out.

 Not saying that everyone will be willing but if you can find someone that's patient and cares it will help you a lot with taking off the weight of all your thoughts."
SuicideWatch,ez3k9p4,t3_cztaq5,1567669121.0,"Let's approach this logically. This is gonna be the most cliche bullshit you're gonna hear on this so get ready.

1. Connecting -> people like having a basis to which they can define your relationship with them. Try to talk about the event you're at; class you're in; thing you both support or attend etc. This makes you less than total strangers and you can talk about this. People also love comiserating so find something you both find annoying!

2. Understanding -> this is all about them. Show real interest and viewpoints towards things about things they're interested in. Travel, degrees, jobs, music. Find out about them and really ask detailed questions. This shows you actually care and are interested in them. In regards to viewpoints you can disagree with people but don't be offensive about it and really try to understand their side. This is not a time to pick apart their argument.

3. Providing value - this might not always be appropriate or possible. Find something they need: help with a class, directions, advice, stationery etc. Again keep it relevant and appropriate. Don't bring up something they might be insecure about and say they need make-up. Maybe even let them bring something up.

4. Saying bye - most of your interactions wont end in someone treating you as disposable or you getting into a relationship and that is 100% okay. Just interacting with people is going to build your confidence and experience. 

People are usually too involved in their own issues and business to be bothered about shit talking someone they don't know or isn't crucially connected to. Sometimes people are just gonna have an interaction with you and that's it.

I'm really proud of how you've gotten this far and I hope you can find the confidence and skill to improve your life. 

Good luck my dude."
SuicideWatch,ez3irp2,t1_ez2k6ur,1567668029.0,"Even just finding someone who listens. It can honestly be anybody. Being less alone with your thoughts means that you're less alone with your issues. 
I've had plenty of friends (incl myself) who were unexpectedly the best people I could lean on. Sometimes all it takes is just finding another person who can help you carry the load."
SuicideWatch,ez3iexw,t1_ez1syfy,1567667838.0,"This might piss you off. 

A lot of the time you're gonna interact with someone, you'll walk away thinking they think you're so weird or they think you smell or maybe you thought your breath stinks or what if you thought your outfit suddenly looked shit.

But that's the thing. All of this - you thought it.

They didn't tell you that. Most of these negative thoughts came out from you. How you talk; view; interact with yourself ultimately forms the basis on how you think people might interact with you.

Sometimes this isn't true and people do talk shit and think lowly of you. But you need to be on your own team first if you're going to make any progress. Fake it till you make it really works I promise - just gotta keep the act strong.

Good luck with it all. I hope you find the strength to deal with life."
SuicideWatch,eyw5vgf,t3_cz2mrq,1567521672.0,"It might do you good to approach law enforcement about this. If you know who did it and can get evidence (or provide evidence should it happen again) they will investigate and hopefully take him away. 

I assure you watching him go down will be so much better than giving in to the nightmare.

I hope you can find the strength to keep going - we're all with you here!"

SuicideWatch,eyitmo4,t1_eyirp73,1567107435.0,"Maybe it's not a case of pushing harder but pushing differently (I wrote applications differently, changed my appearance, clothing, posture).

No, DOMS is a tenporary feeling that eventually subsides as your muscles get used to physical strain. Don't wait for it to heal. Only work on a few muscle groups per day (e.g. forearms, bicep & chest on Monday; deadlifts and cardio on friday etc.). By doing this your routine isn't broken because you only work some parts of your body. It will come back when you raise the intensity of your workout."
SuicideWatch,eyisfz3,t3_cwczqb,1567106934.0,"I hope you're still alive to read this.

That's whats known as an unhealthy friendship. None of the other details matter because right now he is a threat to your health. If you want to break things down and take one problem at a time i'd say its a pretty good time to cut him off."
SuicideWatch,eyiorx7,t3_cx3e4g,1567105339.0,"That's tough dude. Feeling like you've always drawn the short straw. After a while, with all your compounding thoughts it must really feel like you're the only one fighting on your team while the rest of the world is against you. 

I know what it's like in your situation - looking for jobs or love or trying to lose weight and making really no progress. It's really looked down upon in this subreddit but it's what I needed to hear:

""Nobody owes you anything""

These business' don't hire people they feel sorry for; the girls won't like you out of pity; your university won't even give you your marksheet unless you show up and demand it from them. Life won't move unless you make it. Placing the blame onto something external is really easy because then it is out of your control. But in reality, you have more control over your life than you think. 

It's cliche but a particular change in mindset or approach will get you so far. The bank won't get back to you? show up in person. Your uni won't give you your marks? call and email until they do (same deal with your laptop). Push and don't stop. 

Look, it's okay to feel down and out and defeated because honestly, the push is bad. It's so bad and nothing is going to make it feel any better except moving forward. But eventually, you are going to have to pick yourself up and keep moving because the truth is no one else is going to get you moving for you. It's up or out - your move. 

In regards to your happiness just take it one step at a time dude. I can see that you're placing a lot of your happiness into your physical image and how girls (an external factor) respond to you. Try creating other healthier and controllable sources of happiness for you. 

p.s. That pain you feel is DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) and it's normal :) gym-rats are obsessed with it because it's the quickest indicator of muscle progress and development. Muscle needs the energy to survive and as you build it you can speed up your metabolism and eventually burn more fat."
SuicideWatch,eyiivbo,t3_cx21po,1567103053.0,"Same as yourself. I still have hope. I still want to see this through. I still want to win. 

Not afraid of the other side anymore. I suppose I'm curious now - but there are still things I want to do and want to be so I can't go yet. I'm not going till I'm done."
SuicideWatch,ey7p4k6,t3_cw04im,1566893492.0,"Hey dude. Not gonna try and force any cliche advice onto you - you've probably been using your own means to keep going considering you're still alive.

I understand where you're coming from - i've literally been in a similar scenario and made a lot of attempts. 

I know you don't actually want to die - you just want to end the life you're living right now. It seems a bit odd but I always saw suicide as the last form of self care and self-pity you can give to yourself in a tough time. But if you kill youself now you might never be able to change your life for the better or at the very least make it to a better situation. 

I hope you do decide to stick around though. You never know whats around the corner."
SuicideWatch,exakfwg,t3_crw6he,1566109941.0,"I understand this. Sometimes when you're just in so much pain, suicide seems like the only option for self care. It seems so much easier to release yourself from the pain rather than go on.

I also saw suicide as my last option to be on my side. Despite this I couldn't shake the feeling like I was betraying myself. Like if I killed myself, everybody else wins and I lose. I lose because I wasn't on my own side anymore.

Whatever you do, I always looked at it this way. When you kill yourself you reduce your chances of getting better to zero. You'll never find out what's around the corner if you're dead. Your way out could come tomorrow or in a month but if you die now then you'd never know.

I hope things get better for you OP. You played your cards and made it this far. I hope you can find the strength to keep it going."

melbourne,ewyj7r9,t3_cqnpsz,1565881999.0,"Hey. I don't go to La Trobe (doing law/commerce at Deakin) but lower ATAR's don't make a difference.

For the most part, employers look at the units you took, your GPA, extracurriculars (e.g. clubs, honours societies etc.) and experiences (e.g. internships, study tours, volunteering).

I can't attest to the quality of education you'd receive but you should definitely talk to current students at open days. Academic rankings aren't useful for determining quality because they're based on other things such as research, intl student population, industry and academic perceptions and so on.

You should definitely go to La Trobe: If they're the only uni offering the course you want to do; If you live so close to La Trobe that it's so much more convenient than other unis; If your course has a good reputation at La Trobe and had solid industry connections."
getdisciplined,ev5e8tx,t3_b7w4d8,1564232326.0,"Hey guy. I'm in a similar spot right now so I managed to find your post. 

I'm not super knowledgable in IT (econ major) but I realised you've got a degree in IT and a passion for languages and cultures so a few ideas came to mind. 

1. Apply to work for Duolingo's Team. They need people to work back and front end + it's work in a subject you like. 
2. Do freelance IT work. Apps like Fiver would be good. 
3. Do remote IT development - just doing simple apps or websites."
