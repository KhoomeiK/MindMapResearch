probably will get flak for this but there is fault on both sides. Mainly the op, but no one is innocent (except for the kids of course and the unborn baby)

Consider wording and communicating better, give her some slack, hormones are no joke. Been through it twice myself.

Your mother in law can do one, no need to make snide comments like that to you. It only makes things worse.

Do your fair share and then some. You might be surprised how much slack you may get in return for those gaming hours you want. Whether it's the first or in your case, soon to be 4th kid, it's always stressful, scary and manic. Keep your chin up. Make it up to your better half, sooner rather than later"
