Your not alone, im struggling alot atm myself, but if ive helped in anyway then ive done what i set out to do.

SuicideWatch,fiog33p,t1_fina70r,1582582592.0,"It can all be very intrusive, i get that. I found it really hard to talk to doctors and psychiatrists about everything in my life. For now please don't make any rash decisions and just give yourself some time to sleep on everything. It can sometimes be surprising how much reflection you can have over just a couple nights sleep. But if you dont want to talk to them, then at the end of the day that is completely your call, I just hope everything gets better for you from here, because today you've taken a huge step. If you ever want someone to vent to feel free to PM and i will listen. Sometimes might take a while to write back but if it helps then it helps."
mentalillness,fiodt5b,t1_finsgnx,1582581290.0,"Thankyou

It's definitely not for everyone and even some of the people that it is 'for' get broken by it. The amount of chefs i worked with that had/developed drinking and drug problems to cope was no joke. It doesnt help that i think owners forget the people that work for them are human beings and not bots that can do 12+ straight shift 5 days a week.  


Every job come with its ups and down and I thinks it starting to dawn on a lot of people that certain aspects within certain jobs can be very drain, physically and mentally. Its good to see some business recognizing this, mainly office jobs from what ive read, but we've still got a long way to go before we get to the point where employers view their employees as human-beings. But one step at a time i guess"
SuicideWatch,fina136,t3_f8sv50,1582559177.0,"First of all well done and I'm glad your still here :)

What seem like it would be relaxing right now? Binge some netflix, read a book, have a shower/bath. Seems stupid but just relax for the rest of the day and take your mind off what has just happened. When I say 'take your mind off what just happened' i dont mean suppress it though. Any emotions that appear, acknowledge them, then let them pass. If you need to cry then cry, if you need to punch something then do, just make sure its inanimate. It's okay to feel like this, it's okay to not be okay. At some point over the next few days get in touch with your doctor and talk to them about it. It can seem daunting, but they're there to help.   


Sending love and positivity your way <3"

depression,fin78q7,t1_fin48h2,1582557413.0,"I'd second this. I had a real unpleasant time with fluoxetine. Some meds can exacerbate the feeling, which fluoxetine did for me, increasing suicidal tendencies and self-loathing. Talk to the doctor about this and ask to try something else. 

On another note, were all glad your still here. I know it can be hard but talking/venting the problems has helped me immensely over the past few months, even though at times its painful to do in the moment"

mentalillness,fimtf2o,t3_f8p9ht,1582546283.0,"This can be hard to do though. I worked in the hospitality sector for 7 years as a chef, working my way up to sous. By the end of it all I had had 3 breakdowns and a few panic attacks at work. In the majority of places i worked, if you rang up sick, physically or mentally, you would get disciplined for it. If you where physically sick without a doctors note, most places you were expected too show up and they'll send you home if you seem to sick to work, let alone if you were dealing with mental health problem. Tbh kitchen work made me feel like a weak, insignificant person for having mental health issues, as there was always a sense of 'man the fuck up or get the fuck out'. They would make you feel like you've let the team down as they're short staffed for the day. Not having a family to support me I was always terrified to take a day off for mental health reasons because fear of loosing my job, resulting in me being homeless as i was pretty much living payday to payday"

Its okay to question yourself and how you think you feel, but just don't over do it (easier said than done, I know). Nothing is permanent and feeling and thoughts fluctuate. When you next do feel happy or joyful, just try postponing that voice that's says your faking it because you have these feeling, even if its for a minute longer than previously, because that's one minute more of time when your not overwhelmed by the other thoughts and feelings."
