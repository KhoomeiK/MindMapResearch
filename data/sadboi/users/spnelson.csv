I was seeing a new guy and was round his place watching South Park. Wanted to pick up some weed so called a number I knew. Went to wait outside by the road for the drop off/pick up (also good to note the guy I got weed off was more of a group of guys who all drove different cars, it was a big ‚Äòcompany‚Äô).

So, I was waiting by the side of the road outside the house, it was quite a cold night so I was wearing jeans, big fluffy jumper and a big parka. A car pulls up with this big dude inside. I jump in and he starts to drive down the street. I wait a moment to see if he gets the weed out to exchange but nope, he says ‚Äòso how long have you been doing this?‚Äô And tries to hand me a faaat wad of cash. I look at him confused as hell like ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô And he looks at me like ‚Äò...you‚Äôre not a..?‚Äô. I reply ‚ÄòNo! What the fuck?!‚Äô.

He does stop the car and ask me why I was waiting there to which I said I was waiting for my weed guy. He opens the glovebox and pulls out a bunch of baggies but I just hoped the fuck out of there. Turns out my regular weed guy was in the car in front watching the whole thing unfold and wondering what the fuck I was doing.
