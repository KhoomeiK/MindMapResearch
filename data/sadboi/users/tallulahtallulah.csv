insaneparents,fcuj89h,t1_fcug8ui,1577982237.0,A girl who had done a lot of shitty things to me sent me a message saying she was sorry. I didn't have anything nice to say at that time and wasn't ready to forgive. I chose not to respond and she died three days later in an accident. I am very thankful I didn't respond instead of responding negatively.  It was a very large life lesson.
twilight,fcsxzpf,t1_fc7nyok,1577927940.0,I felt like the first movie especially really showed her relationships well with her human friends. She likes them enough but she doesn't ever get as comfortable or as engaged as she does with the Cullens. She doesn't vibe as well with them I think.
twilight,fcslenl,t3_eicwca,1577918995.0,"I think it could also just to make it more entertaining to watch. A lot of the book is interesting for Bella's inner monologue but if you were actually watching it she's kind of just bopping around thinking about Edward. 

The 'Say it!' 'Vampire!' scene was horrible though and I wish they'd never put it in."
EatingDisorders,f5d8cng,t3_dmhkpq,1572149982.0,"I wonder if it's a BPD trait as well? I feel like I have periods of disordered eating where I'll be absolutely obsessed for awhile but then once my mind shifts into a new obsession I relax on it quite a bit or don't think much on it. It's usually triggered by a non intentional weight loss and then becomes intentional almost in a way where I want to see how far I can push it? Sometimes I think with BPD it's another form of self harm. I've recently quit drinking and now I'm obsessed with how little I can eat? I wonder sometimes why my brain is so intent on hurting me. 
But I also am always wondering 'am I doing this for attention? Am I just pretending?'

....and that all sounds absolutely insane. But I really needed to get it out somewhere and I am waiting to get into my psychiatrist. So please don't judge me to harshly."
EatingDisorders,f5d7eo2,t1_f52bzpt,1572149595.0,Thank you for mentioning the 'right' to things. I struggle with feeling like a faker because I don't feel like I have the right to 'claim' a struggle because I believe someone else has it much worse and I would somehow be taking away from them? I do this with many things and it has heeded me in getting help for a few different things but it's a very hard idea to work past in your brain!
trashy,f0wkm4s,t1_f0wgolf,1569009078.0,I am one of these people and am also sober. This is why if anyone offers me homemade candy or baked goods I always ask if there’s weed in them. People think it’s no big deal but it is for me!
vanderpumprules,eol52r8,t3_bs7qft,1558665809.0,Literally looks the exact same to me.
