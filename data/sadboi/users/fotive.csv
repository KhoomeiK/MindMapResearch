Caliburn is easily the better of the 2.  Gala has a design flaw where the pod will not connect to the battery because top of battery casing is slanted. Often u have to jiggle the pod back in place. Decent pod device, wouldn‚Äôt recommend with all the great options out there. I‚Äôm using it because I don‚Äôt like my dna go Orion and i need a second pod so I don‚Äôt overuse my caliburn."
