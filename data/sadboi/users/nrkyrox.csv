Centrelink rejected my wife's JobSeeker application because my fortnightly income for the two months previous made enough to (pro-rata'd) earn about 80k in the year. It's now a month later and I'm looking at a way to buy an old caravan to live in my relo's driveway out in West Gippsland for a couple of years so we don't have to declare bankruptcy.
My second job, forklift driving and labouring for events at MCEC and MCG has all dried up, and Metro refuses to put in writing that they're cutting our hours, so I can't get help with reducing the rent. But at least we don't have to pay $200 a week for childcare fees, so we can still afford to eat, but not pay car rego, power bill, etc.
