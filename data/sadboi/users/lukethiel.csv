When the game came out the peak was about 40K and could hold that many at once at 150 per square, it's still like that, just.. dead. Easily one of my top 3 most played games. Basically be a pirate, build a base, raid other bases, steal shit, be a pirate, get drunk, look for treasure, fight skeletons guarding treasure, build your own ship with full customization.
