SuicideWatch,fgnwstk,t3_eyjkyc,1580954609.0,"I want to commit suicide but I don't want it to be a surprise to my family. I would rather talk to them about why I want to do it and even if they don't support it or agree, we can at least say our good byes. I have lost several friends who didnt even show a sign that they were thinking about it.  I found it very painful to deal with. Does anyone have any recommendations on this?"
