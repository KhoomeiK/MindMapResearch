AskWomen,eu3k1gc,t3_cehb76,1563416787.0,When you have something in your mind that you want to talk about to your partner (whether it’s about your life or relationship) but instead you just keep it to yourself
BreakUps,etrea1c,t1_etr5zi8,1563118969.0,I don’t know why but your comment gave me so much comfort and courage. Knowing that someone is going through the same thing makes me believe that I’m not alone in this long hard battle. Thank you and I really hope the best for you.
BreakUps,es6awh9,t3_c65dax,1561645026.0,Damn I feel this. My ex used to be so scared of being abandoned and always begged me not to break up with him whenever we argued. I always thought I was the one who’s going to decide the future of our relationship. Not that I was arrogant and thought he need me more but that I thought he loved me no matter what. I was so wrong.
BreakUps,erla9j6,t3_c2n3hs,1560982038.0,Same. I miss him. I can’t get him out of my head. I really wish he were back.. i miss his smile.
AskReddit,erjwtg8,t1_erj3n17,1560949354.0,This one is sad.
BreakUps,eravvli,t1_erauwyo,1560654213.0,How could people pretend like nothing’s happening when they’re actually thinking of breaking up? We were also talking about our trip in 2 months and 3 months. I even booked the place to stay. It doesn’t get better. I feel stupid and hopeless and gosh this sucks. I feel so lost.
BreakUps,eqsrub3,t1_eqs2ugw,1560292158.0,I feel you. It’s also hard for me to meet people so I know your pain. Knowing that I’ll struggle a lot to find someone new makes it even more depressing. But hang in there.
