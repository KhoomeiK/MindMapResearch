From my first day, this game is very slow paced. There's no instant gratification. You have to grind a little, wait in real time, and have to play for the future not the present. I'm only on the first day so there wasn't much to do. I practically hit a progress wall by 3 hours in including the tutorial which is around 1 hour. But I can tell it will pick up once it gets going. It's like the Sims but with cute animals graphics and simple gameplay. It's another simulation of life. So you'll like it if you like that sort of game. It's not about farming, nor earning money, nor completing the game. People like it because its a cute and has a very family friendly appeal to escape from their real life. But from the my first day, it's not a game you can just keep playing all day, I think because you will eventually hit a progress wall each day at some point. Also, it's one of those games that encourages you to play everyday. There is daily bonus and consecutive bonus that adds up like mobile games.

Edit: because the game runs on real time, you have to make time to play it at different times of the day. I can see this being a chore and getting in my real life schedule but at the end of the day, it's just a game and you should prioritize real life more than this."
