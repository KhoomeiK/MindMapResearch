CrusadeMemes,fqi668g,t1_fqi3m42,1589390977.0,"You realize Twitter isn't the government, right? As much as I would quite like that post struck, the post itself doesn't break any actual laws for a government body to step in, and twitter as a company seems quite content protecting pedos at the moment. They have a rampant amount of accounts openly parading themselves as pedos and it's the accounts that point it out that get suspended. 

Further fire to the flame, if you go to twitter's rules and guidelines under child exploitation and scroll down to ""What is not a violation"", they've written themselves a convenient loophole in their own rules to continue protecting them.

dankmemes,fmki613,t3_fvlsof,1586155771.0,"Ok, so this just triggered a memory that happened like a decade ago. Legitimately a true story.

I was in Gym class in 6th grade. We had two special ed kids in our class. Both mentally challenged with physical issues to go with. One of them was this girl in a wheelchair. Didn't talk much, but by all accounts, sweet as could be. Anyway, the gym teacher decided to ""make up"" some shitty game where we used these like foam dodge balls and tennis rackets and it was basically indoor baseball after that. He had the brilliant idea of putting the girl in the wheelchair behind the pitcher, thinking that was somehow the safest place for her. I don't think he's ever been more wrong in his life. 

So we're going through playing this stupid game. I come up to bat. Literally my time as batter.  They threw the ball and I hit that fucking thing as hard as I could. Full fucking force, as much as 14yr old me could muster. My thinking was, ""I don't want to run. I'll hit it hella hard to the back of the gym and get a home run and just walk to the back of the line."" NOPE. NOT THAT DAY. I hit that ball as hard as I could and it flew like it was on a laser guided path straight out from me and hit this poor girl RIGHT IN THE FUCKING FACE. I heard the impact, the gym went quiet, the girl burst in to tears. I didn't know what the hell to do. Total accident. Everybody starts calling me an ass hole. As if I had any control over the rotation of the earth to know that thing was gonna fly on a rocket propelled laser guided path. I got pulled out of class and I think she got sent home for the day."

Now, this is mostly just my opinion, though just about everybody that I've talked to has agreed for the most part with these sentiments.

An AMD CPU can get the job done, but liquid cool it. I would get a new Ryzen. Obviously work within your budget and be aware of what settings you're going to need to run your games on. But a Ryzen 7 1700X is actually really decent for what it is. It's what I use in my One PC Streaming set up. Put an H60 Liquid Cooler on it and it won't give you any troubles. But if you really want to spend a bit more money, a 7 2700X is right in the game. You can look at the Ryzen 5's being 6 cores, but I wouldn't go less than an 8 core.

For GPU's, I wouldn't run AMD for streaming. For general home gaming, sure it can get the job done, but they pretty well always seem to cause problems when streaming. Save yourself the trouble and use NVida. If you're on a budget, a 1060 6gb will work. I know because I'm using it. If you have the budget, go ahead for like a GTX 2070 and you'll be golden. But Nvidia simply has more power than AMD for graphics processing and streaming really stresses your GPU.

Most everything else from there will fall in to place. Your motherboard choice will be dependent on your CPU, then what RAM is compatible and what you can afford, you get the idea.

Like I said, this is all mostly my opinion. Do what you will."
