YarnAddicts,f2d916b,t1_f24jft0,1570148699.0,"(Sorry I can’t share photos of this at the moment.)

MATERIALS:
-Yarn 
-Rug canvas 
-Latch hook (tool)
-Scissors 
-Glue gun


Steps to make latch hook letters:


1. Draw out your letter on rug canvas. I did mine by hand because I use to draw a lot of block letters in middle school. I used a ruler to make sure they were a similar size. (Do not cut them out)

2. Prepare yarn but cutting pieces that are
 about 2.5 inches long. it okay if they are not the same length, you are going to trim later! Working with 3 inch pieces leave a little more room to hold onto the yarn. Test out a couple pieces and see what works for you. 

(To save time,  cut multiple long pieces, gather them. Cut many 2.5” pieces at the same time.)

3. Use latch hook tool to fill in your letters with yarn. 

4. Turn over your material so the fuzzy side is face down. 

5. (Step 5 and 6 needs to be done right away, before you start, Make sure you have glue for your glue gun and have a spot to plug it in. You need to be careful with these next two steps, or you will undo your hard latch hooking work.) 

now its time to cut out the letters. You are going to cut out a larger letter letter than what you latch hooked or drew. Leave a centimeter of space around your letter. This is so you can fold it over. Example: If you are making the letter ‘T’ and the top of your letter is 6 cm wide, your cut of the letter would be 8cm wide. 6 cm of latch hooked yarn with 1 cm of empty rug canvas on both sides- a flap. 

6. With the fuzzy side of the letter down and the flatter side up, you are going to start glueing. 

(I do a lot of art with hot glue, so I’m sorry if this part is more difficult than you expected. P.s. you will burn yourself.. it happens every-time! I wish you the best. 

7. Now you are going to want to glue down the extra flap.  The goal of this is to hide the white rug canvas and secure it so it doesn’t fall apart.  Rug canvas was NOT made to be cut, but we don’t care! You do not need to glue the whole letter. Just the edges, so it does not unravel. When doing corners, cut a single slit angling your sissies straight into the corner. This way you can do each side separately. This is the same idea you will use for round letters. Cutting many skits along the way. The fuzzy yarn will hide the corner your fold makes. 

        Tips to not burn yourself:
        - Put your glue gun on low
        - do small amounts at a time. 
        - use a tool to spread the hot glue like a piece     of cardboard. Glue, and fold over the flap with your cardboard tool. 

(I’m sure you could use different things instead of hot glue like a thick mod podge or a fabric stabilizer. I just haven’t experimented yet. 

8. Once dry, turn it over  and check out your new letter! Time to trim it up. I recommend trimming them all to the same length. I pick a piece with a length in the middle. Leaving it longer will look fluffier. Short pieces will look tighter, too short and you will see the fabric on the back. 

Feel free to ask any questions! I may have missed some things! Wish you luck if you decide to give it a try!"
Mindfulness,f27tpll,t3_dcegw8,1570045886.0,"Maybe you can make a list of all the things you will have control over. (Good reminder to focus on) What time you wake up, what you wear, who you sit by etc. do you enjoy writing or doodling? Maybe keeping a small journal with you could be helpful?  (Art project, puzzle game, fidget spinner, practice flipping a coin around your fingers, take photos) You sound like you know you will have a good time, but maybe having something with you could help? Just some things that have worked for me. Wish you luck"

Look at the vintage you have and start comparing  tags, side seems, T-shirt sleeve length. I’ve gotten to the point where I can walk down the racks at the thrift store and can pull vintage without having to flip through. 

Once you start seeing patterns it gets much easier."

TwoXChromosomes,etka3pw,t3_cc0zvm,1562892763.0,"I BELIEVE YOU! 

First off: I am so proud of you for going to the hospital and asking to speak to the police. 

You are such a strong person. You can do this! How would I possibly know that? You are taking action! You did everything in your power by going to get a rape test and getting the police involved. Even after the horrible treatment you received from the nurse and police officer you continue to fight for yourself and others like you. Even after that, you reached out to us for help. Some people will never experience pain this bad, and here you are FIGHTING the fight. 

My heart sunk when I read your post. I used to feel/ say those same things. I’m here to tell you things WILL get better. You can do this! I know you can get through this. It may be ugly, it may take some time, it may be the hardest thing you ever do. IT WILL ALL BE WORTH IT! You won’t feel like this forever. The world needs strong people like you. We want you here with us. You are a survivor! 

Here are a couple things that helped get me out of my dark hole. (My story was similar to yours.) 

1. Make a safety plan for suicidal thoughts. Text or call a suicide hotline. Call a friend. Take a shower. Do 25 jumping jacks. Watch your favorite movie. Distract yourself! Hopefully you can surround yourself with a loved one or a pet. Do what you can to be safe and keep your mind thinking about something else. For me I would take a cold shower to slow down my body and watch scary movies or YouTube videos of people reuniting with their dogs. It helped to cry about something else! 

2. Find a sexual assault advocate. They can talk to the police, provide support and information and are often fellow survivors. (Basically they are amazing people that can help you with whatever you need) I would be more than happy to help you find someone in your area. 

3. Find a support group and or therapist. They can help in so many ways!

YOU GOT THIS! KEEP FIGHTING! WE CARE! WE BELIEVE YOU! YOU MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE! 

(Now go write those things on your mirror!)

This was not your fault! You did nothing wrong"

YarnAddicts,etciufa,t1_esrqdz1,1562685775.0,"Yes, that’s basically it! You can get the banking online or at craft stores. The longer the piece, the easier it is to handle.
