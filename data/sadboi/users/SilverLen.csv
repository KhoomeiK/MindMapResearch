That means taking mental health seriously enough to make it part of early education.

That means a functional support system for everyone, without concern for eligibility and whether or not the ones who need them can pay for it.

That means a societal redesign of the nuclear family concept that spreads the burden of responsibility and expectation. As well as an adjustment of existing expectations toward realism.

That means the death of the stigma of asking for help.

Often domestic abuse is a horrifying cycle of misery for everyone involved, usually because of a failure to both communicate, comprehend, and realize alternatives.
