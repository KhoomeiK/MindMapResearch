Let him know that it would be hard to be in little space with him without him being your daddy and let him know that if you cant be in that kind of relationship together then it would be a boundary to go into little space during sex? ask him why he instigated and what he wanted/wants out of it, and similarly tell him what you would want from him if you were to have a ddlg dynamic so there is no confusion or blowing up of expectations.

AnorexiaNervosa,fjnl5ur,t3_feas7w,1583509705.0,categorizing food as good and bad is an eating disorder mindset - it's surprising how much ed culture is embedded within mainstream culture and that makes it so much harder to get better especially with people commenting left and right about their own guilt about the thing you both are eating like wow karen should i feel bad about this cake then too? is that what your saying? and then act so concerned when i dont eat anything at your family get together?? fuck its hard

Sometimes intention doesn't matter when youre upsetting or potentiallly relapsing someone KNOWINGLY. Tell him you would like it if he didnt comment on your weight in the future and if he does it again kick his ass and focus on recovery. I have heard that durring recovery one should stay single or not start new relationship for like the first year bc all your attention should be going to you and not another new person. This may be especially true in this case if you are having to navigate around teaching him how to be supportive and gentle towards you as you recover. yeah, i say step away from the relationship and focus on romancing yourself!"

COMMUNICATION about the context in which things are happening and talking before and after about the emotions to make sure everyone is on the same page.

She is not entitled to you continuing, and it is a bit immature for her to not listen to you/not want to talk about it after, though as a sub I do understand a bit of her emotional reaction and the intensity that a scene like that can cause, paired with the abrupt ending. You did everything right as far as I can tell, but you really ought to talk about it after and debrief, esp if you are planning on playing again, in order to be sure that you can handle a reaction like that together.
