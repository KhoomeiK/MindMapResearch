The abstract sums things up, but you have to pay for access to the full article. The point is, there is a difference. Psychosis can result from PTSD. On the surface, there may not seem to be much difference. But how you treat the different situations should, in theory, be dramatically different. If your psychosis is from PTSD, you're very lucky to have found somebody who can tell the difference.

As for your friend who is not talking to you, have you considered discussing it with him? I don't know the backstory. Challenge your paranoia by confronting the relationship problems, with the understanding that you might not be seeing the issues clearly. He has his own thoughts and emotions, and they might not line up with your own fears. Just remember, friendship is never a one-way street, at least not for long. That applies to both of you. And even if something's not right between you, what's the worst that can happen? You will survive. But isolating yourself from the situation and getting caught up in your own fears may guarantee the end to the relationship. It's not a comfortable path, it's very draining, but it is very low-effort. It is not commendable.

schizophrenia,f98ayep,t3_e43qkc,1575176071.0,"No matter what you do, time will pass. I graduated with a tech degree that I never ended up using and is now obsolete. I too no longer liked my field of study when I graduated, but  I think I would be much further in life if I had just used it. Time has passed, and I have little to show for it.

I say you should follow your dream of becoming a writer, writing in your spare time while earning financial stability working in a lab if necessary--or whatever job you can grab using your degree. If you choose in advance to focus on the negatives all the time, all you will find is negatives. A career and a good paycheck is nothing to scoff at. At the very least, a good job can help fund research into your unorthodox ideas, too--if you really choose to follow them--and may open doors if you do follow up on research.

I'm going to be straight with you, though you may not like it. Get pissed off if you want, and if you think I'm wrong don't complain to me, just prove it to yourself. I don't think you have what it takes to make a living as a writer. Writing, like anything else, takes commitment and dedication. Screw passion. Passion may help you write a scene once you've started, but it won't make you sit down and write. Writing is a job, like any other, and done consistently is can be a real drag, like anything else. It takes discipline. Screw your feelings. If you only write when you feel like it, I only ask, ""How's that working out for you?"" If you want to jump out the escape hatch and back out of STEM, don't do so with a false, romanticized narrative about becoming a writer dancing around in your head.

If you really want to write, you've got to learn to finish. You have to learn to commit. STEM may really be the wrong choice for you, but don't think that backing out of one commitment will magically help you with another that simply ""feels good.""

If you don't like what I'm saying, it is 100% up to you to prove me that I'm wrong and it doesn't apply to you. But if you don't have a very clear idea of where you're going and you're not willing to think through what it really take to succeed, you're going to end up nowhere. Been there, done that.

Stick with STEM. Write in your spare time, and learn to finish. Get a therapist if you really need to work out self-esteem issues so you can write, but in the end no one will write your words for you. If, while working and earning a decent living, you build up the mental and emotional resources it takes to write, good for you. Best case scenario, you have extra funds from a good job you can use to take some time off to write.

I speak from experience having dealt with similar, non-psychotic delusions. Do the research. Do a brutal assessment of what it will take to succeed in your dream job. There's a difference between just being negative and developing a willingness to do what it takes. Don't alter your whole course based on feelings without a plan. Otherwise, time will pass and you'll have abandoned all chance of actually doing something with your life.

I think I have felt alone maybe less than half a dozen times in the past two and a half-decades. And when that happened, it was fleeting. So I don't know how much I can relate.

Fight the fight you can.

I think it's unfortunate that the normal approach is to assume that since the beliefs aren't real, the trauma isn't.

After all, someone can be traumatized by a threat when the person making the threat might never intend to carry it out.

schizophrenia,f6vgbmy,t3_dt599k,1573185400.0,"Before medication was popularized, psychotherapy was the treatment of choice. As in, totally mainstream. And yes, there were recoveries with psychotherapy alone.

I think psychotherapy is a valid way to treat some incidences of psychosis. Even without medication. However, pharmaceuticals are a multi-billion dollar industry, and those with the money have no interest in seeing popular alternatives. Besides, psychotherapy as a treatment is an extremely labor-intensive process, one that requires an above average number of visits to a specially trained psychotherapist. With the decline of asylums, there is little chance to engage in such therapy under controlled conditions the way there used to be.  Besides, the average psychologist these days is no longer trained in the appropriate methods. The point is, it's much cheaper and more effective in the short term to medicate someone if all you want is results. Both medication and psychotherapy can eliminate symptoms, but neither is proven effective in all (or even most) cases.

Once you're on medication, you're kind of stuck with it. The problem with discontinuing medication is that there is a biochemical backlash in the brain that causes one to be increasingly susceptible to psychosis. And the longer you are on anti-psychotics, the more dependent you are on them.

So am I surprised that no one talks about psychotherapy as a primary treatment for schizophrenia anymore? Not at all. Follow the money."

But expect nothing from him. It may be even further cruelty to yourself to expect something you will never receive.
