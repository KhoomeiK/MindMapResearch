At home with my chemistry kit I extracted the addrenaline fron the adrenal gland. When my dad came back from work he made a coffee and I put the addrenaline in it when he wasn't looking. After gives of drinking the coffee he started going crazy and punching the walls of our house until his hands were bleeding I ring the cops and they came he started punching them and they arrested him and he had to spend 1 year in jail. I never told my dad I spiked his coffee

For example the point about Halloween costumes, people say certain Halloween costumes are cultural appropriation. for example if you dress like an African tribes man or a native American  then you are culturally appropriating. If you dress up like a vampire or zombie ect you are not. What people are telling you off for saying merry Christmas or clapping if they do dont waste your time thinking about it.

depression,f5vz2es,t1_f5vskpx,1572507375.0,I know this feeling. Being alone is the worst thing ever. I wish I didn't have any desire for companionship because it makes me more vunerable. When it doesn't go the way I would like with some one I like then it makes the whe situation worse. Now I can't even hug my freinds because I don't won't to be close to any one so they can't hurt me. A few years ago I wasn't like this but patterns of pain have done this and I'm now a zombie.

Come up with a new a name a new persona. Be that crazy new artis that doesn't give a fuck what people think. Learn a new craft and mix it with the old. Finish everything you make or destroy it to get closure. Make art people don't think is yours and do t tell it you either. This stuff will make you art more fun and more interesting for you!! Your Art is  you life anything less then It ain't worth it.

depression,f5f2bp5,t3_dlfw2v,1572177571.0,I've been increasingly more depressed and hopesless. Recently I decided not to even talk to people about this anymore because I feel like I bring them down and they can't help me. They don't really understand. I'm a creative person and I use art as means of escape but it also isolates me. when I see people finding love so easily I envy their ability to show their feeling as I'm so scared to. I'm often not sure why I feel so negative about things. I guess I see now the dreams I rhougj would come true in my life such finding love and a purpose are all but gone. Knowing this makes me more nihilistic and makes me act in way that furthers my depression and thoughts of hopelessness. I told a new friend of mine that in 6 years I would take my own life and I would do with a positive mindset and try and have the best time of my life before this. Im thinking of lowering this down to less as 6 years seems far to long.
