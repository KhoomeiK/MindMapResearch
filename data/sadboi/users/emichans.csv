AskReddit,fh3y9xj,t3_f18upu,1581273445.0,I don’t have access to a gun or a high building/bridge. Overdosing would mean my parents would find me. It would devastate them and my friends who’ve helped me survive so far after my previous attempts. A small part of me still wants to follow my dreams. But they are unattainable so I am stuck.
SuicideWatch,fh2n027,t3_f0xfqt,1581258137.0,"I hope you are still here op. I’m only 22 and been mentally ill and gone through traumatic events and attempted suicide and I don’t have a job or anything and it feels too much sometimes for me so I can’t begin to imagine how much pain you are in. But 40 is still young, you can start new things, discover more about yourself and what you like. I don’t know how to say that without sounding cliche and unoriginal but I really do believe in you. I hope you can find peace and help."

entitledparents,eyojrh8,t3_cxtp71,1567278202.0,"oh my Lord. 
I went to the Dresden camp 5 years ago on a school music trip.  Years 10-12. ( I was Y12) and me and my classmates were quiet and absolutely horrified and sad as we walked through the bed bunk rooms, and the gas chamber. I can’t describe the emotion I felt. And, lo and behold, some bratty Y10 girls are giggling and taking selfies leaning against the walls of the gas chamber. Where there are nail scratch marks. Where people died. The shutter sound isn’t off either. They skipped out to go out near the woods to “get a better background”.
Honestly I’m still mad about it."

depression,exbe1k8,t3_cruf0x,1566129133.0,"wow. this has been my life since i was 13. i’ve started and stopped so many things. i even moved to another country to pursue music when i was quite happy. cost tonnes of money. but now the cycle of depression has come back and i don’t care about it. 

honestly, if it weren’t for depression and other mental illnesses, i would have been a professional violinist by now. my parents and friends always say it’s such a waste of talent, why don’t you start your career. LIKE i know. i know my potential. i just can’t reach it. so yeah, i feel you."
SuicideWatch,exbd4ge,t3_crwa6s,1566128520.0,"i hope you’ll be okay. suicide isn’t worth it. i know exactly what you’re experiencing. i took 70 paracetamol when i was 15. i fell asleep. what saved my life was i heard a voice (don’t know how to explain that) saying “wake up.” then i’m throwing up non stop. parents called an ambulance and i thought i was going to die. i was awake until i got to the hospital. i was shaking, cold but sweating so much. i was seeing triple of everything. luckily i didn’t have liver damage . i was saved because i threw up quickly. but it was hell for the next week in the icu on a drip constantly, passing in and out of consciousness. i now can’t take paracetamol and struggle with taking capsule pills without being sick. 
i hope you find a new motivation for life. it’s hard, but it’s possible. 
please, take care, get help. i love you. :)"

So I said I want to try despite having no experience except for cartwheels. She asks are you sure? I say yes it looks fun! So she helps flip me and next thing I know I’m on the ground and can’t feel my left arm at all. My friend starts screaming. I look and my arm is in a literal S shape. I broke it in 2 places. I couldn’t feel anything so I didn’t cry, but she was freaking out and ran to get my parents. Never tried backflips after that!"
