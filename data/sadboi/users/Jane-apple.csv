ODDSupport,fp3xbl7,t3_e718da,1588287552.0,"I was horrible. My parents almost shipped me off too. It's not too late. Just to really show him you care and want to help him get better. Sometimes my parents felt like my worst enemy.... and that they didn't want to understand what was happening in my head. I grew up, realized that I was hurting the people around me, that it was affecting my friendships and I decided it was time to change myself. If you have any questions please feel free to message me. I just want to help!"
ODDSupport,fp3wnbo,t1_fp3wf4f,1588287187.0,"Concerta was no good for me as well. It totally TANKED me. At school I was so zombied out and I hated it. When I would get home in my comfort zone and be attacked with chores, questions, and homework, I too would become angry and lash out. I really do feel like adhd meds dont help shit. I've been on many different kinds. It's all about wanting to change your ways and be a better person. Therapy helped to keep those things under wrap."
ODDSupport,fp3wf4f,t3_e718da,1588287065.0,"Hi I am 19 years old, I have ODD and ADHD and I also used to take CONCERTA. I was not an easy one to raise. The bursts of anger suck. The feelings of worthlessness suck. Self harm is common. I also have anxiety so I understand! Now when my parents disciplined, they screamed. They hit. It does NOT help! Try a calm approach. And ask them, why are you angry? Is it worth being angry over? Can we fix it? I know for one thing, when my parents took things away/ waved in my face they were going to take things away it definitely just lit this fire inside of me and I would go off. I would just monitor how much time they get on said devices, and if they have a problem with that, take it for good, until they can learn to think through their emotions, and not take it out on others. But this is where you have to watch out for self harm. I really used to beat myself up over it. I live by myself now, and have a little life for myself. Things get better, and I can promise you the anger you are seeing from them, they just don't know what to do. They feel like anger and it consumes them. It's hard, and I know you're trying to parent, and you don't want to tolerate any bad behavior, my parents didn't either. With compassion and the willingness to learn, things change."

makemychoice,fne15l7,t1_fndxqal,1586881216.0,I love the shirt! And it looks so good on you! I'm just worried my head is gonna look big :/ I was looking to borrow a pair of clippers from my parents and now they both are strongly against it and I dont know what to do. I live on my own so I can do what I want but my dad is old school and anytime I've dyed or cut my hair hes had a pretty strong opinion.
