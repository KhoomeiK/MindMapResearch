AmItheAsshole,fql15sb,t1_fql0dcw,1589442693.0,"I know, girl. I’ve been there. It feels like the end of the world to realize someone’s manipulating you, especially when you love them. 

But how many times have you had to apologize? How many times has he? How many times have you had to defend yourself only to give in when he won’t let up? 

You’re going to get so so tired. And five years is a long ass time but you guys had so many formative years together that it’s hard to know who you are. Your life revolves around this person because it feels like it always has. And I know it’s scary to think of change. And to dive into a world alone and without a person. But you’re a person. And you’ll have you. And if you’ve made it this far? Girl, you’ll be more than fine. 

Try to be alone with your thoughts for awhile. Maybe don’t text him/call him/contact him for some time, and think about how important you should be to both him and yourself. I bet you anything, he gets mad about that instead of caring enough about you to let you think. Even if he doesn’t get mad right away, he’ll hold it against you later on. And hopefully with some space, you’ll realize you don’t deserve that. 

You are not responsible for his insecurities. Period. 💜"
AmItheAsshole,fqkzt98,t3_gjhiah,1589441392.0,"NTA. At all. Your boyfriend is being needlessly controlling, especially threatening you with the fact that he gave you the Xbox. Remind him that it was a gift, not a fucking way to control you. Do you mind me asking how old the two of you are? How long you’ve been dating? 

Sounds like he’s an insecure boy that is emotionally abusing you. You’re going to blame yourself every time for his insecurities which is why you came here. It’s obvious he’s had similar behavior before, just based on this post. I know it’s hard, but please just try researching mental/emotional abuse, and see what’s happening to you. I know it’s scary. But please just try.

It’s just a game. You don’t know that dude in real life and it doesn’t matter anyways. Your boyfriend doesn’t *own* you. He should get some fucking therapy though, that’s for damn sure."

My confidence dropped to an all time low being in these classes with him. He was that asshole professor who was so out of touch with his students that when I told him I had 3 jobs during his class, which made it really hard to make what he wanted, he just said “oh well a lot of students work so.”

Yeah most of them worked TEN HOUR WORK WEEKS. I was working 50+ and going to school full time! I cried right in front of him when I was talking to him about this. He told me to just keep working, put in the time. (even though that was probably my third all-nighter that week)

I left the class and I didn’t go back until our final critiques. Got a B, and never took a class with him again after that."

As I’m walking, this truck came down the road out of nowhere, and I had a gut feeling. I heard them take a u-turn almost immediately when they passed me. I hightailed up the stair next to a building and ran to hide behind a dumpster. Before I completely got up the stairs, the truck stopped where I had run up the stairs, and I heard the door open and close. 

I shit you not, I heard the truck go round the block THREE times before I finally heard it leave. After, I ran straight home and took a different route than I normally do. 

A day or two later, I learned that my city is one of the top five cities for sex trafficking. I think I made the right choice."
