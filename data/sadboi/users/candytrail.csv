AmItheAsshole,fql15sb,t1_fql0dcw,1589442693.0,"I know, girl. I‚Äôve been there. It feels like the end of the world to realize someone‚Äôs manipulating you, especially when you love them. 

But how many times have you had to apologize? How many times has he? How many times have you had to defend yourself only to give in when he won‚Äôt let up? 

You‚Äôre going to get so so tired. And five years is a long ass time but you guys had so many formative years together that it‚Äôs hard to know who you are. Your life revolves around this person because it feels like it always has. And I know it‚Äôs scary to think of change. And to dive into a world alone and without a person. But you‚Äôre a person. And you‚Äôll have you. And if you‚Äôve made it this far? Girl, you‚Äôll be more than fine. 

Try to be alone with your thoughts for awhile. Maybe don‚Äôt text him/call him/contact him for some time, and think about how important you should be to both him and yourself. I bet you anything, he gets mad about that instead of caring enough about you to let you think. Even if he doesn‚Äôt get mad right away, he‚Äôll hold it against you later on. And hopefully with some space, you‚Äôll realize you don‚Äôt deserve that. 

You are not responsible for his insecurities. Period. üíú"
AmItheAsshole,fqkzt98,t3_gjhiah,1589441392.0,"NTA. At all. Your boyfriend is being needlessly controlling, especially threatening you with the fact that he gave you the Xbox. Remind him that it was a gift, not a fucking way to control you. Do you mind me asking how old the two of you are? How long you‚Äôve been dating? 

Sounds like he‚Äôs an insecure boy that is emotionally abusing you. You‚Äôre going to blame yourself every time for his insecurities which is why you came here. It‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs had similar behavior before, just based on this post. I know it‚Äôs hard, but please just try researching mental/emotional abuse, and see what‚Äôs happening to you. I know it‚Äôs scary. But please just try.

It‚Äôs just a game. You don‚Äôt know that dude in real life and it doesn‚Äôt matter anyways. Your boyfriend doesn‚Äôt *own* you. He should get some fucking therapy though, that‚Äôs for damn sure."

My confidence dropped to an all time low being in these classes with him. He was that asshole professor who was so out of touch with his students that when I told him I had 3 jobs during his class, which made it really hard to make what he wanted, he just said ‚Äúoh well a lot of students work so.‚Äù

Yeah most of them worked TEN HOUR WORK WEEKS. I was working 50+ and going to school full time! I cried right in front of him when I was talking to him about this. He told me to just keep working, put in the time. (even though that was probably my third all-nighter that week)

I left the class and I didn‚Äôt go back until our final critiques. Got a B, and never took a class with him again after that."

Before I completely got up the stairs, the truck stopped where I had run up the stairs, and I heard the door open and close. 

I shit you not, I heard the truck go round the block THREE times before I finally heard it leave. After, I ran straight home and took a different route than I normally do.
