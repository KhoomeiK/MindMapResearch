EarthPorn,fpvtpr4,t1_fpvsa5c,1588951658.0,"Croatia is just lovely as is Greece. Split and Hvar are absolutely gorgeous and so much fun. If you want to be surrounded by beauty in peace and quiet at a reasonable budget, I would really recommend some of the less popular islands. I was in Naxos around this time last year and I would go back in a heartbeat."

I can't send my husband out to the grocery store without him calling 3-4 times while he's there, despite being provided with a detailed written list. He ""forgets"" to grab a portion of the things on the list and brings back quite a few things that were not on the list, resulting in me having to make a follow up trip."

Found half a closet full of porn DVDs and video tapes (this was almost 20 years ago), also a stack of condoms. The whole weekend was full of giggles, exasperated sighs, and head shaking. I knew my grandpa was a bit of as perv but goddamn!"

travel,fj2uta4,t1_fj2jc4l,1582954734.0,That's awful! I also recently had to quit my miserable job of almost 3 years so that I could take my dream vacation. I was only gone 3 weeks.
travel,fj2ul0x,t3_fb5rep,1582954508.0,"Yes! This! Last summer I did a 2-week group tour in eastern Europe plus a few days on my own. I was the only American in the group and among the oldest. Everyone was appalled that I had never been able to take a trip like this before because it's so hard to find a job that'll give that much vacation time. Meanwhile, they get to do this sort of thing at least once a year."

todayilearned,fg8fm77,t3_exdi9i,1580618053.0,"Idk if that holds up in my town (Looking Beach, CA). We have a very famous traffic circle on the east side of town and people love to gun it there. Every so often some douchebag in a sports car will lose control of their vehicle and end up wrapped around a light pole or through one of the buildings in the surrounding shopping center. Not sure what the fatality rate."
BPD,fc1acv5,t3_efgqu7,1577312840.0,Too often. But there's no home to go to. I split from my husband earlier this year and got my own place just a few months ago so that doesn't quite feel like home yet. And then my parents sold my childhood home 3 years ago and moved 10 hours away. Visiting them is as close to going home as I have but due to work I can only go a few times a year. So I'm just left feeling permanently homesick.
