With what you've been through, and are still going through, it could get to the best of us. Congratulations on the benign reading, that is a HUGE relief. But I'm sorry about your nerves. 

Everything that ever was suddenly spilling into a life where you, on top of all the other shit, have to stay home and sit with it all is something so difficult I think a lot of us forget the extent. I truly hope you find relief in all this mess. Thank you for pushing on. Thank you so much for sharing with me."

Hey if you're working you're working. I understand that feeling though, medical professionals and cashiers are hot stuff nowadays lol. Personally I feel like everyone plays a part in some way, that all contributes to this funny system."

blackladies,fjwrdij,t3_ff62x4,1583643817.0,"You've posted a lot of self deprecating stuff on here from what I've seen on your posts. I highly suggest you talk to a therapist if you haven't done so already. I say this with the upmost sincerity because low-key, even though you've posted an avi pic, you are sounding like a troll pretending to be a black woman.   Stop venting through Reddit, a site notorious for shit heads and incels."
