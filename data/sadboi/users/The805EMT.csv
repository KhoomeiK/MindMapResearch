LifeProTips,flytzjd,t1_flypx7k,1585609065.0,"The gyms run on a simple principle and most have overhead cost that make small profit margins for a gym unless you have your act squared away. I will try and explain it very simple.

1. Most gyms prefer what we call EFT monthly payments (Electronic Funds Transfer). This goes for membership dues and personal training. Ex: $50 membership $150 PT = $200.00 a month per individual. This means they have guaranteed cash flow coming from every individual for the next 12-24 months. (Average contract agreement is 12 months on an auto-renewal policy)

2. When you do a PIF membership / personal training. (Paid In Full) that money goes to pay the bills of the month ALREADY DUE. Ex: Rent, water, Electricity, Cable/WiFi, lease on equipment (if not owned),etc you get the point. This means unless you own the exercise equipment and the land that building is on, you are going to be paying a minimum of $10,000 a month on utilities and rent. 

3. Unless you have that cash flow at the register from PIF’s, drinks, late fees, guest fees, merchandise, etc... You MUST rely on all your membership dues every month to keep your ship a float. ANY DISTURBANCE in this balance will bankrupt your gym.   

So I’m conclusion, for 24 hour fitness, or any gym, freezing your monthly bill or canceling your membership is a huge risk. With them taking a loss and hopefully being able to also stop their rent on the property during this pandemic. But being 24 hour fitness they want every penny. Eventually fail like [Bally Total Fitness.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Total_Fitness) did back in the day.

I’m not saying let people step all over you but also don’t have an attitude while they are trying to teach you something you did “wrong”. Some of them just are straight shooters. When I did my ride outs the EMT was cool as shit and helped me out with every question I had and gave me great tips. On the other hand the Medic was quiet and only spoke a few times and randomly asked me PT questions or assessments to see where my knowledge was. He had an “asshole” attitude but by the end of the shift I got to know him.

His attitude was only because he worked there for so long he would see new EMTs come in, not give a shit or just waste his time. With all his knowledge and skills he felt they didn’t take the job serious. It’s not always trauma calls or crazy shit. Sometimes it’s a IFT 6 hours away at 1am. Sometimes it’s a crazy trauma call.

Remember this job you NEED thick skin not just for your own safety but for your sanity too. You will see people die, decapitated, head blown off, amputated, burned to death, ran over, electrocuted , drown... you get the point.
