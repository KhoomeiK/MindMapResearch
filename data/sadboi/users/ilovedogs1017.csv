I'm a 95 pound female that looks quite harmless but when I'm depressed I can be quite physical with those who I am close with. I take it out by scratching, hitting or just by saying incredibly cruel things. It's a horrible thing and I've been working through it.

My therapist says a lot of it has to do with being more comfortable in a state of anger than in a depressed and self deprecating state."
