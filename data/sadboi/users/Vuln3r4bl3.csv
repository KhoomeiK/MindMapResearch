relationship_advice,fpx3wlv,t3_gg2fku,1588975181.0,"Kinks and fantasies go both ways. Both/all partners need to consent to the thing happening. If you are not into nor comfortable with participating then you are not required to. Talking about sex whether it is about protection, fantasies, kinks, children/family planning, what have you, MUST happen between partners. But no partner is REQUIRED to participate in ALL kinks/fantasies that any/all of their partners have. And everyone should understand that. If someone throws a fit about it then the relationship should be evaluated. That is one part of this situation. 

The other part of this situation is her experience of past assault. If she says she was forced/assaulted but doesn’t actually consider it rape and “let it happen”..... she was raped. And she has some hang ups about it. That is tough to hear and I hate to say it that way but you are right. She was raped. No one lets rape happen, regardless of any kinks they have. Another person forced themselves onto her and that is not her fault. Because of her kink (which it is slightly possible that the kink could have evolved from something into a rape kink because of that assault, but I’m not a therapist or psychologist so I’m not going to presume that’s what happened, just saying it’s possible), there could be some confusion and hurt in her mind about the entire assault. Because rape does sexually excite her she may feel at fault. Again, not my area. But because this is a sticky situation, I would suggest that she DO see a specialist for this particular thing. Rape/assault can hang with you for a LONG time and really screw with you, ESPECIALLY when you do not deal with it. I speak from experience. 

I have known people that had been assaulted and also had rape fantasies. That is not actually super unknown. The people I have known have gone to therapy and worked through their issues, have partners that are very caring (as you seem to be), and have come up with ways to deal with their triggers and kinks all in one. Some people decide NOT to act their fantasies while some do. But it takes time and lots of work. It’s not something they did a whim or on their own. They needed a support system. I would say in these instances there DOES need to be a professional involved in the support system. 

But no, you are not required to participate. But talk to her. Work it out. I hope things continue to go well. It sounds like you have a good/great relationship otherwise."

Your therapist should be able to help direct you to the psychiatrist to get prescriptions for any diagnoses you have with mental health disorders. If they don’t then I would consider asking your guardians/parents to switch to a different therapist. 

Also, your therapist should be made aware that you believe talking isn’t enough. It’s fine that it isn’t and they should not be upset about it. If they are then you DEFINITELY need to switch providers.

moving,fpfbjz3,t3_gcwxpv,1588566571.0,"I literally just finished moving cross-country a few hours ago. It’s tough. I was born and raised in the same state I left earlier this week and I’ve never even visited the state I now live in. I *had* to move for work. I don’t know anyone in this state and it’s the middle of a pandemic (the reason for my move/work) so I know exactly what feelings you are talking about. I’ve been terrified and scared and excited and feeling every and all emotions that I possibly can since I was told this was happening. The only “person” I didn’t leave behind was my fur child. Literally every one else important in my life was left in the other diagonally opposite corner of the country. 

But I love of adventure. I love exploring. The drive out here was incredible and gorgeous and a little crazy but worth it. I have no idea what the future will bring. Maybe the people closest to me will end up here with me within the year. Maybe I’ll move back in 6 months. Maybe the world will experience some other insane thing that rips in half. 

I’ve learned that I just have to take life one day at a time. Which is crazy difficult because I am a planner. I like to know what is going to happen, but it is impossible to know because it’s life. It’s a series of random acts that move in a mostly linear fashion. 

I know I’ll make friends here and if I eventually end up somewhere else I will miss them just as much as I miss everyone back home right now. You’re planning this move with your partner though, so you will have each other and have a purpose for the move. So you will be fine. Yeah you’ll feel all sorts of crazy things but every major life change brings literally every possible emotion: buying a house, getting married, having a child, graduation, a death in the family, moving. Because your life is changing. And it’s okay. Your feelings are valid and life happens. 

You just gotta take a deep breath, yell ‘plot twist’, and keep moving forward."
relationship_advice,fowymcv,t3_g9pbol,1588129984.0,"I would get a divorce and consider if you want to carry your pregnancy to term. I know that may sound extreme. But please read what I have to say. 

Beating a dog to the point of breaking its HIP takes a lot of effort. It is not someone just casually does or does after getting annoyed because the dog was scratching at a door one day, or even if the behavior was a continuous thing, without having first done other actions to the dog. He likely started by yelling or little foot nudges, then graduated into more aggressive means of getting his point across to your dog such as actual kicks or hits. The thing is: dogs don’t understand violence. They only become scared for a bit and then forget. They don’t speak our language in any sense. They can learn commands based on voice level, hand motions, sounds, etc. but that is about it. 

This is also likely not the only time or way your husband has shown violence or abusive behaviors/actions. It can be very difficult to see when you are so deep into a relationship, especially if you grew up with any trauma or had some similar behaviors/actions from a parental figure. It is just your normal and doesn’t seem or sound like abuse or violence until someone points it out to you. 

Aside from all of that, this pandemic is going to change people. Sometimes for the better, but sometimes for the worse. This could have just all started a few months ago but even still, you have ever right to be concerned about him being violent and then joking about it. That’s not okay and it’s not something that is acceptable nor should be anyone’s normal. 

The reason I mention considering taking your pregnancy to term is because if you do get divorced or go through that process, it is his child. Legally, he would have the right to still see them even after a divorce. And I’m that case, you wouldn’t be around to make sure your child was safe from any violence or abuse. If that is something you want to risk on the chance he won’t be allowed to have any visiting privileges or hope that he gets enough help, that’s fine. But it’s worth taking the time to think about and deciding on your own before you tell him you are pregnant (if you haven’t yet).

I hope you are safe and are able to get things worked out. I do think talking to him would be a good idea, but I also think that if I was in your position, I would just rather get out of there.

bisexualadults,fokc4gh,t3_g7dqsa,1587839305.0,"The biggest thing I can tell you is to be yourself. There may need to be some additional expiration as to what/who that is and that’s okay. Just be open and communicate with your spouse. 

But there is no one right way to be visibly bisexual. Try a few thing. The suggestion of pride wear is one way. There is the bisexual flag that you can wear and the combo of the colors of it. Some people embrace that. You can embrace presenting as more feminine sometimes. That’s great and valid too. You can join a bisexual or LGBTQ+ group, which I also highly suggest as depending on your area there may be some really great options. You can shout it from the rooftops every hour of every day. If that’s your jam, you can go for it, though there will be some people that resist it. There may also be noise ordinances. Lol. 

I would definitely say started to grow your circle of friends to include more LGBTQ+ people, specifically bisexual and non-binary people, and taking a look inside to see if your sexuality is something that changes your mannerisms. When you’re around people you are out to, how do you behave differently? Do you sit differently, say words with some flair, use your hands more, purse your lips, etc. Doing those actions around everyone, just being yourself around everyone is a bit of a calling card sometimes, to “hey! I’m part of the LGBTQ+ community!” Or even just “hey! I’m different!”. 

The other big thing I would suggest is being an advocate. Learn about bisexual issues, and other LGBTQ+ issues and speak up about them on social media or in conversations. This isn’t for everyone but it’s a good way to show that you are an ally and an easy to slip in the fact that you are bisexual. 

You can also share memes about bisexuality and follow bisexual fan pages, since we are in the middle of a pandemic and you can’t do as much human interaction right now.

I do not see a single relationship, even if it for the rest of my life, as being forced to pick a side or limiting myself. My desires for other genders still exists. It isn’t belittled by that relationship. But I digress. 

The break was wholly their choice. I was not given a say in the matter. I was asked if I was okay with it, and at the time I said “sure” because I figured it was a temporary measure. That initial conversation happened 7 months ago. The discovery about polyamory happened about 2 months ago. I have been considering many questions and polyamory a lot with things that had been said during that initial conversation and some other issues with communication and trust during our relationship and I came to realize a few things: I can’t do polyamory. I can’t even consider rethinking about polyamory until our relationship gets back on solid footing, if that were to happen. I try to think about polyamory, but when I do, I feel as though despite the communication and trust issues, it was fulfilling sexually and romantically and that with a bit of work, it would be all I need. I do think I would need to see progress on their side to consider polyamory further. I have thought of it previously when I had been infatuated with someone and at the time did not realize it. I think if I had done it then it would not have gone well. I do think I may have a bit too much of a need for attention from my partner to be able to fairly split attention in a poly relationship. 

Additionally, and I will say I am aware this sounds juvenile: I feel so deeply about them that any time I even start to think about the possibility of dating others or having to start dating again, I break down and cry. I feel as though they are the person I am meant to spend the rest of my life with. My best friend has told me that my entire mood changes when I spend time with my ex, that I’ve never been happier than around them. I wouldn’t purposefully put my life on hold, but it does feel like it has been put on hold, or like I am stuck revolving around them. It doesn’t help that they tell me on a daily basis they love me still, despite me asking them to stop."

AskReddit,flelr1a,t3_fodsp3,1585086811.0,"If I’m remembering my genetics correctly (it’s been awhile since I took my biology courses) you share more DNA with a sibling, even a half-sibling, than you do with a cousin. With a cousin, you are already removing DNA relations because it was your parent’s sibling. They would have a close match, but they are different people meaning they are one step removed from each other biologically (1). 

However, you were created because your parents had sex to make you. That removes you from the aunt/uncle (2). And because your aunt/uncle created your cousin by having sex with someone else (usually not related to your family) then that further removes you biologically from the cousin (3). So you are now 3 steps removed from the cousin.

With a half-sibling.... you have let’s say the same dad. Unlike the cousin bit, this is the same person biologically. So when dad has sex with each mom, that means off-spring are 1 step removed, but that’s it. 

At least, that’s the way I look at it. Now I could be wrong. It could be both are 2 steps removed and it’s the same amount of DNA. Or it could be cousin is a bit closer genetically. I am a bit curious now, I have half-siblings myself."

If it was just OP and sir at the movie and the 2 drink instances..... then they were dates? Why are you upset that he took time off after your rejection? Did you just want the attention without the attachment? Obviously if your company has a policy against supervisor/subordinate relationships.... but besides that. What else is going on OP?"

To sir they may have seemed like leading him on. So sir may have been assuming that things needed to be slow moving and quiet, like the way he did the chocolates on Valentine’s this year. Communication wasn’t happening great and maybe sir isn’t used to communication in relationships so this was fine or normal for him. Everyone’s normal is different. If it was just OP and sir on those 3 instances.... then talking directly to him about it much sooner should have happened. It is leading someone on.

depression,fjzasz7,t3_ffm8jw,1583715362.0,"Unfortunately you can’t force someone to do something. But it would help to get them into therapy. A psychologist, therapist, or counselor would be the one to do the talking and other therapies while a psychiatrist would do prescription management. Sometimes a psychologist is certified or has the correct degree to do both. If you live in a country in which you have your own insurance then you will need to check with your insurance carrier/company for options. They are usually very helpful with navigating this, some more than others. If you are in a place where it is a government provided care then you would need to check with them for a list of providers. I am in America so that’s what my experience comes from. 

There are some stand alone providers and there are some groups whom employ a mixture so that all needs are met in the same office. There are also some groups that are strictly psychiatric and strictly psychological services. Again, it will help to connect with your insurance carrier to find a list of providers. This can sometimes be done in the website or app, if either of those exist. 

From there, once you get a list of providers, doing a bit of research to find what the providers specialize in will be the next step. You don’t want your child seeing a provider that specializes in ADHD when their problem is Anxiety. Make sense? You should not be at sessions with your child but it would be good if you did have some sessions yourself for the best ways to support your child and whatever else the provider may suggest. You won’t be told all of the issues but you will be given tools on the best way to support your child. 

It’s great that you want to help but don’t force it. Suggest it, set it up, and then let it happen at its own pace. It may take longer than you think it needs to. It may be that talking works best. Or just medication works best or a mixture of both works best. It’s different for everyone. But this is mostly up to your child to work on. You can help and guide but if they aren’t ready yet, please do not force them. Especially don’t force medication. It is usually mood altering and it can really mess you up. 

Just let your child know that you love them and want to help them but that you will follow their lead in this. It will be tough to sit by and watch but it is tough for them too. It is often most difficult admitting that you need help with mental health issues, especially to parents. 

Patience and lots of love. Thank you for wanting to help your child. Some parents don’t."

I know it sucks but continuing to deal with the situation as an adult will go a long way with your partner.

Because it looks like this: your son is being sent to school in clothes that are ill fitting and dirty on a daily basis, as far as you know. It could be just when you get him but it could be every day. Honestly, you don’t know. 

I would personally get others involved. Ask the teacher if your son seems to be doing okay, if his clothing is acceptable on a regular basis or if his mother is sending him to school in ill fitting, dirty, or old/torn clothing daily. Regardless of what the teacher says, I would then reach out to your lawyer with the photos and what she said to find out if there’s something that can be done. 

If this is a daily thing, you may not have to pay alimony/support anymore or you may get your son full time. If this is a vindictive thing, she may lose part of her rights or support still because this could be causing psychological harm to your son. If anything, it will be forced to stop. 

I’m sorry your son is going through this but I ask you to not send your son back to her in the same clothing. Imagine how it must make him feel to wear those clothes. If you have to, send them back in his backpack or something or keep them as yard work or workout clothes or rags if that’s something you want to do. But don’t humiliate him by making him wear those clothes again."

NonBinary,fi1wk4y,t1_fi1jubv,1582066255.0,"I’ve seen a few different version of that poster. I like it. 

I suppose I’ve always viewed trans to be more inline with the binary of gender expression and sex. What I mean by that is in experiences and what I’ve seen/heard/read and people I’ve know that are trans tend to be very much not their assigned gender/sex and very much yes the other, when considering the binary. They also go through a trans-Ition. I know that is not the purpose of the word, but my brain correlates it as such. 

Whereas non-binary people or people that use they/them pronouns or prefer to express themselves androgynously do not want to really associate with the binary. They are a lot more fluid and although it is not entirely another gender, they all kind of make their own or can identify as another or other genders. Some of them do also sometimes fluctuate to include using their assigned at birth pronouns or the other binary pronouns but I’ve never seen much of an at-large or permanent transition when someone realizes or comes at non-binary, agender, gender-non-conforming, etc. 

Granted this is only based on my experiences and I have missed some of the actual initial coming outs. But that is why I asked. It seems like a bigger deal to be a trans person when you are essentially “swapping” genders (I apologize if that language is course, I am not sure how else to word it) and going through that transition. I feel like it may take away from their experiences to share the word trans with all non-binary people? I do not mean to belittle anyone’s experiences, and I don’t mean to take any terms away from anyone. If that is the term someone wants to use, by all means, please do! 

I myself am trying to figure exactly who/what I am, gender wise and I’m trying to understand the complexity of the different verbiage, how others view things, their stories, and everything else I can learn so I can try to figure things out for myself. I don’t mean to sound defensive so I apologize if I do. I just want to discuss things, and when I get excited or passionate about a topic I can be a little intense. 😅"

NonBinary,fi0zna5,t3_d0858b,1582047815.0,"Thank you for sharing your story and asking these questions. I know you posted this a long time ago, but I am just starting my journey in trying to figure who or what I am. I realized that although I’m afab, I have always defaulted to she/her pronouns and although it has never made me feel dysphoria, it’s never made me feel euphoria. I’ve been very ‘girly’ and have at time wanted to be done with my breasts and have wanted to have a penis. So now I’m wondering if maybe I’m non-binary or something so I’m reading as many stories and questions as I can to try to understand what is going on in my head. 

And I will say though, that I’ve gone through kind of waves of gender identity maybe? There’s been a few different times in my life where I have dressed super butch and even bought clothes strictly from the boys/men’s departments and there was even a year or two where I was super femme (especially for certain toxic people in my life at the time). So I feel like that’s pretty normal to just have phases or for your presentation and dress to change? That’s just my experience, though. 

I know our stories and situations are pretty different, but I also feel like I do understand where you are coming from in a sense. Boobs are definitely a hassle so I don’t blame you for not wanting them. I hope things have gotten better since you did post this."

Reason 1: “Looks like you have bump in your toe. Idk. All I can do is buddy tape and wrap your ankle.” Turns out I had split my toe down the middle and that little ‘bump’ was a fragment that split off and is still trying to fuse back into the toe more than 5 months later (after a terrible podiatrist wasted 2.5 months on top of that initial visit).

Reason 2: Couldn’t keep my injuries straight between while ankle and knee were injured where there were actually bleeding wounds when I had tripped on some bricks and fell (year prior). 

Reason 3: Couldn’t see me one day because I had flu symptoms, if I recall correctly. It was a few years ago now but I had made the appointment online and then when I got there was turned away when I checked in. If I’m remembering correctly, I was sent to the ER.

Reasons 1 & 2 were at the same clinic location, reason 3 was at another location, but owned by the same people/company. Yeah it’s cheaper than the ER. But with this particular clinic system, they have more often than not, sent me to their ER system once they finish with me. It’s happened at least 4 times.

If the top authority of a nation is abusive their power, they don’t deserve that power. Because they don’t understand that power or how to properly use it. And if that same is ALSO obstructing the process to which part of the government operates, again, they do not understand the system of which they are a civil servant and employee, because that IS what the president is, AND they do not deserve to hold that office. The president is elected because the people trust them with the authority of that office, the power which they hold, and the government of the nation. If the president tries to stop any part of the system of which they command, then they either do not understand how it works or why it works the way it does. Additionally, they may be trying to hide something else they did that the part they are obstructing is trying to uncover. Which ties into the abuse of power.
