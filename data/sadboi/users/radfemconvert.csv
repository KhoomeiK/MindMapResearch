Harder said than done but try to avoid giving in to the compulsions whenever you have the strength to do so; it only makes the cycle get worse.

Now, onto more practical things. In my experience, medications do WONDERS for OCD -- much more so than for other mental health conditions. By meds, I'm talking SSRIs and SNRIs. HOWEVER, these have pretty awful side effects and, if you don't have any other issues like depression, can I suggest you give Inositol a try first? I'm pretty skeptical about any kind of supplement but after years of struggling with side effects from the antidepressants (don't get me wrong, they do work for the OCD, but they can be debilitating in so many other aspects) I was desperate and tried it. It was like night and day. No side effects and the same reduction of symptoms as in regular meds. You do need to build up the dosage up to 2 full tablespoons a day but it has a mildly sweet taste so it's really easy to incorporate into any drink.

Please, feel free to DM if you have more questions. OCD has almost ruined my life more than once and I wanna help anyone who's going through this before it can get too severe.

Actually, many mental illnesses can be exacerbated by rational thinking. I'll give you an example. Someone's OCD can sometimes get worse *precisely* because they can find a rational explanation for very unlikely events to happen. But in general, as a blanket statement it only plays into the stereotype that if you're just smart/logical/(enter any adjective you want) enough, you can't suffer from a mental illness.
