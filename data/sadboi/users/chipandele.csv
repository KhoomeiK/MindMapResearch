""O tempo é indivisível. Dize,
Qual o sentido do calendário?
Tombam as folhas e fica a árvore,
Contra o vento incerto e vário.

A vida é indivisível. Mesmo
A que se julga mais dispersa
E pertence a um eterno diálogo
A mais inconsequente conversa.

Todos os poemas são um mesmo poema,
Todos os porres são o mesmo porre,
Não é de uma vez que se morre…
Todas as horas são horas extremas!"""
