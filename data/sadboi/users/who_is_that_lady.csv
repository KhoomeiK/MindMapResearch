Say I need to sell 500 cars per year to be successful. Two years ago I sold 200 cars. Last year I sold 400 cars. Sure, that's my most successful year yet - I doubled my sales! - but I'm still 100 cars short of being profitable and successful. With that trajectory I would not last long and my business would fold so I cut costs  and raise prices until I hit that 500 car mark. Failing to cut cost in the short term could sacrifice the whole business and *everyone* would be out of a job in the long term.

So that's his big scheme. *so* evil."
