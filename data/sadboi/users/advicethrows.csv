BDSMcommunity,fo542ms,t1_fo431ux,1587517062.0,"Thanks for the thoughts, they are helpful.  We have set up a clear agreement relative to the relationship and I'm very familiar with limitations and setting goals that respect them.  Those are really important things.

I think one of the things that is difficult is when that struggle occurs, I often feel that I have little authority to correct it.  There are a lot of negative feelings about the struggle, just as you might have in your example.  However, when those struggles are discussed, it often moves into feelings and me asking why and being met with I"" don't know."". I'm curious how this goes in your dynamic?  My expectations are clear and there are penalties for things that are directly in the dynamic.  However, outside of that, it gets difficult when I ask for action and can't get a lot of focus, or it becomes an emotional  issue.  

I respect what the mental condition allows and doesn't allow, but I guess I often have a lot of trouble knowing when I can push harder and when I can't."
BPDrecovery,fndvi5u,t1_fndobgq,1586878263.0,That does help.  I was asking for a friend and will share your advice with them.

BPD,fmer88t,t1_fmel62k,1586011689.0,"For what it's worth, I think both approaches represent valid strategies for dealing with feelings like that.  I think that your approach may push you a little harder than OP's, but OP may be at a different point in learning how to cope."
BPDrecovery,fm4l6u6,t1_fm4fzr3,1585756197.0,"I understand those feelings.  Therapy, specifically dbt is often reccomended for helping you get to a point where even though you feel these things you are able to move past them in a more productive way.  There are a couple of books I've linked below that have been used.  I have a friend who read the mindfulness one and it has been helpful.  However, none of that is an immediate solution.

In the immediate and long term, you will still always feel this way.  Managing your feelings is what those resources will teach you to do.  So it's not a quick fix, and most certainly requires a ton of effort and likely a therapist.

That's why I shared the perspective I did for your immediate issue.  Tolerating the feelings and taking action in spite of them is where it would seem you're at now.

BPDrecovery,fm49pj6,t1_fm45bee,1585749738.0,"It's probably just scary because it's a new and different situation.  I can understand that, most people are concerned about things changing.


You may also have beliefs about your capability level that make you think you will not be able to handle the situation.  


Sometimes to get past that fear, it's good to look at the current situation vs. what you want and ask ""will this get me there?"". When you feel doubt, you can then ask ""well, do I have a better option?"". If the answer is no, then you build a case for action in spite if your uncertain feelings.


Another common bpd symptom is fear of being alone. Maybe that's what drives it.  Obviously therapy can help with that, but there is also something to be said for recognizing and tolerating that discomfort.  Again, this may trigger that fear, but do you have a better option?"
BPDrecovery,fm44f9a,t3_fsxbi4,1585746238.0,"I think you should ask yourself what these sorts of actions show you about those people.  Your fear of them leaving feels very real, and it's a rough situation to be in.

Here's a thought exercise - what do you think it will take for you to get to a better state relative to your BPD? What kind of support do you need for that and other things in your life?  Do you receive this support from the people you are afraid will ""leave"" you?"
BPDrecovery,flv3yii,t3_fr75yz,1585515869.0,"That's an understandable feeling.  The choice to change is a difficult one to make, and the fact that you decided says a lot.

Your friend is probably trying to support you, and might feel like they can see more in you than it seems like you see in yourself.  That doesn't mean he thinks poorly of you, in fact it's the opposite!

It's ok to do your best.  If your friend can't hear you saying that you are doing what you can right now, maybe try being more direct.  Either way, they believe in you a lot! Don't get discouraged!"
BPDrecovery,flj3sp0,t1_flgz1kl,1585198050.0,"Thats the first time I've seen the term ""distress tolerance."". Can I ask where you got it (if anywhere), and what strategies you have come up with to create that tolerance in yourself or others?"
BorderlinePDisorder,flfpvph,t1_flfocz6,1585113621.0,"You are rather deep in your own head here.  That's probably a rough place to be and I'm sorry.

You're right that relationships can be incredibly helpful to people.  You're also right that it's frustrating to feel like you are in the position you are.  But I can help you with the ""love yourself"" advice.

What that means is twofold.  First, most people are attracted to others who can handle themselves.  Part of that is reaching a level of maturity where you do not mull over how good a relationship would be or what should occur in it.  Instead, you concentrate on making the relationship as best you can for the two of you.  Being in a relationship isn't about you, but I noticed you said very little about the things you can bring to one.

Second, I would challenge your view  that people in a relationship can't recognize loneliness, and that you generally have a strong understanding of relationships.  You shouldn't yet.  Why? You haven't had a ton of learning time about what they are for you.  There's nothing wrong with that.  

In fact I was in a position similar to you at one point in my life.  I'm 34 now.  I look back at me then and wish I could say ""yes, but being with a person and building something meaningful is about so many other things.  All you want is to feel loved and to have sex.""

I don't know if that helps.  It was a bit of a ramble but I need to get to sleep."

BorderlinePDisorder,flcdbfo,t3_fnz6pt,1585026839.0,"Because you are worthwhile.

You have made yourself a trap. You have to confront an issue to confront it.  This situation will not change unless you choose to change it.  It is not a lack of the world caring about you.  It is lack of you deciding to take action.

BorderlinePDisorder,fhhznyh,t3_f36ars,1581614920.0,"Hi! Good news, there are better coping skills within reach.  

Slightly rougher news, it requires doing things that are hard.  How come? Because you develop habits on how to do stuff as life goes on.  Breaking habits is hard but it's possible, and I've seen (and helped) it happen.  I've also seen examples shown to me.

This book has a lot of examples to give you hope.  It also has coping mechanisms that you can learn, but they take work.

I know it's exhausting.  Most work to do the most important things in life is.  Life just ain't easy, and so it goes.  

You can do it.  Just work hard and watch yourself and your mind.  I think of the journey like a railroad track that is all messed up, and one rail is too far from the other.  Your work is to get the tracks closer and closer together, and as you do, the train of your life becomes more stable.

Mindfulness for Borderline Personality Disorder: Relieve Your Suffering Using the Core Skill of Dialectical Behavior Therapy 

https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1608825655/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_CxyrEbVHPNBJ2"
BPD,fhge44t,t3_f319am,1581564798.0,"I am very close with someone who has BPD.  It's hard.  Here's the key things that have helped me:

&#x200B;

1. Recognize that there has to be a choice they make to change.  And they have to commit to that choice.  They can never do it 100% of the time, especially because of the hard days.  But if they don't show that commitment, it's important to keep yourself out of trying to create positive change.  Only they can choose that path.  The best you can do is help show them their options.  They pick.
2. I don't have ton of my ego wrapped up in my battle to help them.  Long ago, I learned who I am.  I am the person that will try to help.  I'm not the person that will always succeed, but I am the person with compassion who will try.  This isn't about you making them feel different.  They have to decide to manage their emotions.  You referenced twice that they feel in the moment different from reality.  You can't ""make"" them believe what is real.  All you can do is help them understand this is temporary.
3. Mindfulness has been shown to be helpful to those who suffer from BPD.  Create habits together that encourage mindfulness.  Set an example and go through the exercises even if you feel they do not specifically help you.  Bring up mindfulness topics when they are going in the wrong direction.  #6 has some resources for that.
4. Their emotions are extremely turbulent.  Recognize that sometimes it's two steps forward, one step back.
5. If they want to change, get them to a therapist.  Ensure that they feel the therapist is a ""match"" for them.  It's one of the most significant hurdles for a client/therapist relationship to work.  Ideally, the therapist should be experienced in BDP and DBT.
6. Read a book about BPD together with them, and share your thoughts.  My friend and I are currently reading ""Mindfulness for Borderline Personality Disorder.""  It helps me understand them better, and it helps them work on their emotions.  I can also help them practice the things in the book, which makes a difference.  I'm thinking about the ""Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook"" next.  I've also seen a lot of good commentary around ""I hate you, don't leave me.""
7. You need boundaries for yourself.  Their life cannot wear on you always.  If it does, then you can't help them anyway, so what's the point?  Take care of yourself.
8. You can both agree on shared rules that push them in a positive direction.
9. Bonus, stalk this subreddit. and sister subreddits like /r/bpdrecovery"
BorderlinePDisorder,fh77r1h,t3_f1ltyl,1581318426.0,"This is a thing that can be done in a lot of different contexts, including kinky control type stuff.  Standard kink practice applies:

Negotiate a safeword to stop things from occuring if you're no longer ok with them.

Clarify the expectation and desire you have of your partner.  Ask them what they think, give them the opportunity to respond.  Tell them it's ok if they don't feel right about the situation.

Discuss starting and ending the arrangement and what expectation you both have.  E.g. if one of you suddenly isn't in a position for the relationship to work, what gets done?   How does the card get back to you?  Other administrative items.

Discuss times you think it's appropriate to spend your money vs. Not.  Their expectations may be different.  Write it out if you can, and negotiate things INTO the agreement.  E.x. you can spend your money any way you want EXCEPT X.  Then you have taken the clearest route towards shared understanding.

These things can surprise you in terms of how you feel about them and how they work out.  Make sure both of you feel alright talking to the other OUTSIDE of the controlling elements so you can adjust.

Start everything with a key premise:. This is your money.  It is yours tondo with what you want and you are asking for help to restrict your activity.  At the end of the day it's still yours.

Any power exchange abides by these rules, and I can give you a million examples of why shit can go tragically wrong for every one of these items.  They are important."
BPD,fh01521,t1_fgxy6ms,1581199528.0,"One of the unfortunate but true things about therapy is the therapist/client match is extremely important.

I think it may be a good idea to take that interaction as evidence this match doesn't work.  Keep going until you find a match that does! It can make a huge difference!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fg7iq30,t3_ex8xcm,1580593491.0,"You were doing well until the following:

> I got emotional and said something like ""I'm sorry whatever you were doing was better than what I could offer"" and that I constantly can't figure out why I'm not good enough for him.

This is assuming his judgement on the situation because you were emotional.  There are many different reasons he may be doing something.  You decided his reason was related to how he values you, relative to others, then put that on him, which is not OK.  

>I told him we must have very different understandings of friendship because if he put together an event and invited me, I'd make sure to be there and support, but apparently he doesn't share the same value for me. He says he does and is just bad with dates. 

Then you further indicated that he is not a true friend to you because a true friend has only one course of action, which is simply not true.

The two items above were emotionally manipulative, and were designed to elicit responses like that.

There's nothing wrong with what you did prior to that point.  It's OK to feel disappointment, it's OK to tell him about it.  But you don't get to tell him why he did what he did.  Only he can tell you that.

It's completely true that ""I'm bad with dates"" is a rather flimsy excuse.  As someone who actually is bad with dates, I know how to not fuck up when I need to, and when I screw up I say I'm bad with dates, but that's no excuse, I should have been there.  

He can tell you what he will.  If you feel that excuse is a poor one you can push on it by saying that you don't feel like it's reasonable, and that your feelings are hurt.  But after that, you make your choices about him and move accordingly.  Don't manipulate him into feeling a specific way about it.  At some point, if it is recurring you decide to either talk to him about it by saying that it hurts you and you don't want to lose his friendship (i.e. try to salvage the situation), or decide on your own that this isn't something you want to pursue anymore.

He certainly owes you an apology.  But emotional manipulation also isn't cool."
BorderlinePDisorder,ffjagig,t1_ffig6l0,1579994207.0,"Thanks so much for your reply.  I appreciate your perspective.  You've said a few times that you intend to compile some sort of resources.  I'm curious if I can be helpful regarding that.  My time is not in abundance, but with what time I have I can collaborate and try to point things in the right direction depending on what you want.

The reminder that accepting reality for reality is not defeat was a good one for me.  Thank you, I appreciate it.

Lastly, relative to sleep being your coping mechanism.  I understand that it stops the mental rumination, but how do you usually feel when you wake up?  do you sleep to get the energy you need to get back to the difficult task of getting your mind back on the straight and narrow?  Or do you legitimately feel that you wake up ""reset"" and with your mind on a new track?"

I'll do the standard thing and link to suicide hotline information below my post.  Other than that, I have this to say:

I am one person who does not expect you to OD or kill yourself.  While I don't have BPD, I am very close with people that do.  I have seen their capacity for joy and know you have that in you too.  There are times when it's tough to feel that joy, and you feel like there is never anything to be had but your current state.  Those are real feelings.  But the joy is too.  As with everything in this world, the only constant is change.  This, too, shall pass.  Joy will come again as will sadness, as will the rich complexity of life.  Please don't leave and please keep yourself safe.

BorderlinePDisorder,ffg3jb6,t3_etefpz,1579897682.0,"Hello! I am mentoring a 20 year old with BPD who has a lot of past trauma, is in a pretty bad home situation (mother's bf is verbally abusive and controlling), and hasn't developed many coping mechanisms that work well. It causes them a lot of spirals and self-hatred that they can't find their way out of.  

So far my focus has been on mindfulness (book: Mindfulness for BPD), providing an ear, understanding that wild emotional swings are real, and also supporting their problem-solving skills.  A lot of the problem solving is about recognizing that their situation may not be ""right,"" but it is real and one must choose effective over fighting against reality.  I'm super proud of them that these methods are starting to yield improvement, but always want to be able to find other opportunities to help.

My questions:

1. From your perspective what are the main categories that you focused on and ultimately helped you improve?

2. What would you tell your 20 year old self and other young people, and how would you help them understand what you're saying?

3. Any thoughts on the outline I gave above or other suggestions for me?

4. Other coping mechanisms or suggestions for when it gets real bad and they are lost in the feelings?"
