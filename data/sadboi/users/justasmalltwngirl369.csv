I know a few older men who needed the procedure due to chronic infections later in life. HIV isn't the only concern. Stds in general are more likely as it's more difficult to clean and harbors bacteria more easily. UTIs are a concern too. Not only can they be very uncomfortable, UTIs can be harmful to your kidneys if left untreated or if they occur too frequently. Sex is still pleasurable and the penis is still sensitive."

I'd brace myself and find out on my own. Go from there. I'd be concerned about cheating, drug abuse or a deteriorating mental state. It could be something else, i hope there is a not so hurtful explanation. Please keep us updated.
Oh, i definitely wouldn't follow him. One, you may get caught and you won't find out what he's doing anytime soon. Two, if he's participating in anything illegal you could be endangering yourself and possibly him."
