I know a few older men who needed the procedure due to chronic infections later in life. HIV isn't the only concern. Stds in general are more likely as it's more difficult to clean and harbors bacteria more easily. UTIs are a concern too. Not only can they be very uncomfortable, UTIs can be harmful to your kidneys if left untreated or if they occur too frequently. Sex is still pleasurable and the penis is still sensitive."

It could be something else, i hope there is a not so hurtful explanation. Please keep us updated.
