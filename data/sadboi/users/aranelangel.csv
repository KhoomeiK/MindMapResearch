The endless driving and lifting and daily interactions with people who may not be in a complimentary mood. The diligence, the attempts to outsmart porch pirates, braving the weather, and of course, delivering packages to bring people joy this holiday season. You are a true hero. Please know you are appreciated. 

Merry Christmas!"

migraine,f8xapr0,t3_e2pd42,1574913036.0,"I hit the ceiling for medication treatment last year. My cardiologist suggested osteotherapy and she and my Neurologist discussed it and decided I should give it a try. Because there was literally nothing left to try at the time. I go to physical therapy twice a week and see a DO. I have had seriously debilitating migraines for over half my life, and I can honestly say this past year has been so amazing. I got to come down off of most of my medication, and am only on Beta blockers and Nabumetone now. The regular therapy has helped me so much and brought my migraines down (severity, intensity & frequency)  so low, my Neurologist has started referring other patients to try it for themselves."

actuallesbians,f8nquwo,t3_e0tsuy,1574650609.0,"Terry Farrell as Jadzia Dax on Deep Space 9. There was an episode where Jadzia introduced everyone to her wife and it was handled like it was the most normal thing. I remember being amazed as a kid that it could just be like that. You could just love a woman and have a wife and it was no big deal; perfectly normal. It was a little more complicated on the show, but the spark was very real, and all I took away as a kid was that lesson. Which was further expounded for me by Xena and Gabrielle's relationship later on. Media presence was a very real factor for me. Which is why I will argue loudly with anyone who tries to take that away from any group."
