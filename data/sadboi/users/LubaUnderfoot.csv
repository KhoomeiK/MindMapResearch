LifeProTips,foxmbl8,t1_fovu14r,1588148577.0,"Posting for solidarity.

My biological father has never been in the picture, and the man my mum married is a child molester.  He was actually charged and acquitted of sexually abusing a different little girl before they started dating and my mum knew about it.  She thought that she ""really knew him"" and he was some sort of ""underdog"" (read: pathetic loser.).  He sexually assaulted me for years and stayed married to my mother for decades after I left the house. She eventually divorced him for frequenting hookers and cheating on her with a guild mate of his from World of Warcraft.

She read me the letter she found that he had written to this mistress, and in it, he was explaining to this woman how her young daughter deserved a father figure in her life.  So I went to the police the next day.  I didn't find out about the previous charge until months after I had gone to the police.  I'm certain my mother only told me because I would have found out during the trial.  She asked me if I wanted her to kill herself.  I told her I didn't and that I forgave her, but truthfully I don't think I'll ever forgive her.  She died a few months ago in a car accident. 

I remember being a teenager and begging her to divorce him.  I told her we could take the money from her half of the house (in the high hundred thousand dollars) and we could get a small place and just live together the two of us.  She told me that it wasn't that simple and she had chosen him.  I decided in that moment, I suppose, not to tell her.  I only came forward once I found out my step father was grooming another woman so he could molest another child.

That was the moment I lost the bond of safety and trust that a child is supposed to have with a parent. By introducing a step father, I lost my mother in every way that matters. 

If she had left him in that moment I would have started recovering the relationship I had with my mother a decade earlier. Maybe my post traumatic stress wouldn't be so bad. Maybe the last ten years of my life wouldn't be marked with police statements and therapy.  Maybe if I had another ten years to work on we could have come to terms with it."

Really, though, all the classes are good and I honestly can't think of any where at least one spec isn't specifically for solo play, so choose whichever class/race combo sounds the coolest for your first character.

There is a really good xp bonus going on right now so it's the perfect time to hop on and try a few combinations. Most of the races have unique starting zones up to level 20 (or so), so you don't have to worry about repeating the same mid-game content over and over.

I would say this spread is ultimately saying that you cannot base your future happiness on what you think might cause others unhappiness, but you may have to make a decision or make a compromise between society/familial expectations and truly realizing your whole self.

The sequence of the cards, to me, suggest that you're inclined to sacrifice your own potential to satisfy the comfort of your family.  It may seem like it's a logical inclination or maybe just an instinctual one. But, with Judgement in the central spot, I think that indicates that is a future you'd be quite content with. 

However, I also think the placement of the Sun card shows that you could really blossom if you embrace your bicurious side.  There is no indication if this is going to be a fulfilling path to love (eg, there isn't anything here that suggests this action will lead you to a soul mate or something - it could, but there's no indicator) BUT I think that you would find an even deeper satisfaction in life. I think this spread indicates that embracing this side of yourself has greater implications on your life than just your sexuality."

Take the time to find a therapist you click with. You're not going to hurt anyone's feelings by trying a session and moving on if it isn't a good match.

Think about the type of person you feel comfortable taking advice from. 

For me it was important to find an older woman who had experience with raising children, and who specialized in working with young children - that's when my trauma started, and that's where I needed to start working through it.  My instinct told me that I would respond best to someone who could understand my issues were those of my child self, not my adult self.  I needed someone who would help me find an approach to solving my problems the way a parent would teach a young child.

You may not have the same needs. You might respond better to someone who feels like a peer, someone closer to your own age, or someone who is the same/opposite gender.

The most important thing is finding someone with whom you can be honest, and who you can feel okay feeling a little awkward around. Some of the techniques therapist will have you try can make you feel kinda silly, some require you suspend your skepticism. Working with someone you feel comfortable with is crucial. Don't waste time with someone you don't jive with - go in for a few sessions, be open to the experience, and if it isn't right move on."
