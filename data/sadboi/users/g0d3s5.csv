crochet,ffuhmm9,t1_ffuagcj,1580242135.0,Thank you so much for your explanation! It is really helpful. I watch vids on YouTube and I pause and try to do exactly what they are doing without understanding the patterns that's why I lose track.

BPD,fbwc2g1,t1_fbc9z2g,1577145988.0,What happened when you introduced yourself to him? I mean I understand that you became even more obsessed with him but how? Is it because you finally started talking which led to your obsession becoming even deeper? Can you please explain?
BPD,fbwbuvg,t1_fbbt88o,1577145836.0,I am sorry to know you feel this too! Humm.. I guess he will never respond!
BPD,fbb2p2v,t3_ecezdi,1576692040.0,All the time! I speak to myself more than I speak with anyone else! I even speak to myself while actually making conversations with other people.
BPD,fbb23e4,t1_fbaxx6g,1576691679.0,"Well, online, I totally understand why people would avoid to converse.. but yeah I get it when you care too to the point that people run away and/or avoid you."
BPD,fbax5bu,t1_fbaun1c,1576688676.0,Thank you! That's exactly what I personally thought I was doing but I keep worrying and wondering if I am too clingy or too pushy.

dating_advice,f1e3w9m,t1_f1e2vjf,1569411898.0,"When I met him, he was completely lost and his life was a total mess (and I was fine with that, I don't mind helping him, and that is not the reason why I think our relation won't work, that is not the rrason why I wanted to break up with him several times). He relies on me in almost everything. Even when he is at work and does not know how to do something he calls me and I give him instructions or I just do it for him.  He says his life will be over without me but he is emotionally hurting me and I can no longer take that. I am fed up. And I try to tell him that as kindly as possible."

dating_advice,f1d3iy0,t1_f1d2yaq,1569372944.0,"Actually I suggested to him that we both consult a specialist, I did it several times, but he refuses every time."
dating_advice,f1d3f2u,t1_f1d28of,1569372863.0,"It is getting worse indeed. Now it is terrible if compared to the first time he threatened to commit suicide. But I am afraid he will hurt himself even if I call the police. I really panic when there's a knife in his hand when he is upset, but still, I don't want him to hurt himself. I don't want to live with the feeling of guilt."
