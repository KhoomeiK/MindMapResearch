trashy,ez00a8x,t1_eyzh7aj,1567627850.0,"It was also an honest question. I wasn't trying for some passive aggressive attack.

If I was in your situation, I would've just cleaned it up and put in on the curb, but in my town curb pickup is super easy and little to no fees. So other than the bit of my own labor, I wouldn't have been out much.

Unless there is more than 4 hours or so of work that I can't tell from your picture. Or there isnt a dumpster or curb side pickup is horrible or expensive or whatever.

But, big thumbs up for responding like a jerk and bringing the down votes. I realize it's ""not your fucking job"" and yes this was a pretty shitty thing to do. But reading thru the other posts you seem to have exhausted all other reasonable options and I was curious why post about it, when you could clean it up. And if not, why not. If you're only answer is that it's ""not your fucking job"", I don't know how to help you and wish you well."

We've just grown so accustomed to the more relative safety of modern space flight.

So going to the moon is still extremely dangerous and getting that to work with regards to modern safety protocols is difficult to balance, especially with current levels of funding."
