I won't give you the answers. But I'll fill in some hints.

&#x200B;

1.) Since the test statistic produces a p-value smaller than \_\_\_\_

>You won't find this from the output. Rather, this is a value you set a-priori as to what you would determine a ""significant"" finding.

 2.) we can \_\_\_\_\_\_ the null hypothesis 

>You can answer this based on your p-value. What does a lower p-value tell you? (Note: your p-value is in scientific notation)

3.) of no association at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ % confidence level. 

>Even though you don't have confidence intervals, I'm fairly positive this will be the R default. What was the confidence interval set for this test? You can read the chi-square R-vignette to get the answer. 

4.) We thus \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ support for our hypothesis. 

>This again will be directly related to your p-value. Does a lower p-value support on not support your hypothesis?"

> I am curious though, when you applied for research lab work with the Psychology department, did you receive any sort of setbacks or barriers from those labs, or labs you've applied for? I would assume that maybe some labs may reject taking you on because you were not specialized in their field. Was this the case for you? 

Nah, it's all in the resume. My supervisor, in fact, has told me it was a strength. Social/Health psych collide so much with public health that you can certainly sell it. Having a methodological focus (as epidemiology has) is much desired in many research fields. There may indeed be cases where they are *required* to only take students in their department. This was not the case for me though. So, you'll have to take that into account. I have yet to experience this though. I probably wasn't even told about them during my time in my public health program. 

> Additionally, when you applied for PhD (this may not come in handy for me until years later), can I safely assume that your research experience aided you into getting accepted? Of course, as multi-disciplined as PH was, you were able to retain the psychological perspective to come up with your PhD thesis? 

Yes, of course. Research experience is an essential and huge factor in decisions. I also had the advantage of knowing the faculty in the psych department though. My Supervisor for the research lab I worked for is now my mentor for my Psych PhD/masters. I was able to retain my psych perspective in my MS/PhD thesis. I study social networks in at-risk youth populations - And this is actually the same work I did with my MPH degree. However, during my MPH degree I was more focused on data collection and data cleaning. Now we are in the analysis phase."

I got a bachelors in Psychology, then an MPH in epidemiology, and now I'm currently working towards a PhD in Applied Social/Health Psychology. I have always worked in behavioral health research. While I was in school for my MPH, I did research with the Psychology department, I did research on at-risk youth populations and evaluation work for at-youth service programs. I have continued that same work into my PhD program. I totally think you can work in public health fields with a health psychology degree, and vice versa. There are joint programs that you can earn an MPH while working towards a PhD in psychology as well. Might be worth it to look for those as well."
