BPD,fqyh9xb,t1_fqw1plm,1589748564.0,"Thank you so much for replying! I agree. Honestly, I have always thought my brother has ASPD. I'm not diagnosing him, but he was either really into the ""I'm edgy"" act or he really has a problem. Since we were young he always used to idolize characters like Alex from A Clockwork Orange and tried to act like them, and he gave me the speech on how he used to torture animals for fun as a kid for years. My best friend met him when she was 16 and she told me he asked her if she was into BDSM because 'she seemed kinky' and then he spent the entire night bragging about how he used to kill animals again. I don't want to be ableist but he's an asshole since he has never gotten any help and I want to stay as far away from him as possible. One time when I was 13 I passed him a tissue and he got upset for the way I did it lmaoo and he started hitting me and then he spit in my face. Now he's married because he accidentally got his girlfriend pregnant 3 years ago and that has kind of made him change for the better but you know, my parents and my family think that a wife and kids = rehab. I'm scared he'll do something to them since one day he told me ""women should be hit by men because they're stupid"". Also he didn't want to get married at all (he threw a tantrum on his wedding day and didn't want to show up lmao) and wanted her to get an abortion. He hasn't said a single word to me in almost 4 years and somehow my parents thinks it's my responsability to talk to him again when I don't want to. They made me live with him and his wife for a year and a half and it was a nightmare. And I think a year ago he was doing meth for like a month because he worked at a store where you had to be awake the whole night.

I think my family doesn't know about their own mental health because my parents were really poor growing up and they have like 9 and 7 siblings, so maybe they didn't have the time or money to actually care about mental health, you know? My grandfathers were both alcoholics and some of my uncles were drug addicts. My dad HATES his entire family so I guess he has some issues too (he acts like he hates everything, he doesn't even have friends). Even when I started showing signs of my mental illness my mom didn't care at all, she used to say I was overreacting, she refused to let me take medication which was AWFUL since I really really need it, she used to show me memes that said ""back in my day we didn't need therapy because or parents just hit us instead"". It wasn't until this last year that she really started to actually care and support me accepting that I do have a mental illness and that I'm not just throwing a tantrum. Sorry for the rant btw!"
BPD,fqy9ncy,t1_fqw2hro,1589745009.0,"Thank you for repying! I agree, I feel like a loser sometimes because there's no ""official"" history of mental illness in my family, but maybe that's because my parents were really poor growing up and my family members didn't have money to go to a doctor or anything. Most of my family members like my grandfathers have been alcoholics and some of them have even been drug addicts. Thank you so much for the reply!

And thank you so much for the good wishes too! I don't want to sound ableist in case my brother actually has a mental illness, but omg he's an asshole. I just want to stay as far away from him as possible but I can't because my parents tell me that I should love and forgive him just because he's my brother etc. In 2017 he got his gf pregnant and they had to get married so I guess that kinda helped him but I'm scared he'll do something to her or the baby (especially since she's a girl) because one day when we went out he told me that ""men should hit women because they deserve it"". I hope he gets better because he made my parents suffer a lot but I want to stay away from him!! It's not like he loves me anyway. He hasn't said a single world to me in over 4 years, and I'm not going to beg a 30 year old to talk to me. Also, my best friend told me that she met him when she was 16, and he asked her if she liked BDSM because she seemed kinky and that he spent the entire night bragging about how he used to torture animals. Sorry for the rant btw!"
BPD,fqw51cw,t1_fqvq67c,1589693052.0,Thank you so much for replying! 💗 I agree with you. Thank you so so much.
BPD,fqv89if,t1_fqv419t,1589671881.0,"Thank you so much for replying! I feel you soooo much. Maybe it's because of the lockdown, but lately I've had to stop myself from reaching out to them because I started thinking a lot about them again out of nowhere. Can I ask how you cut them off? In my case, they ghosted me for no reason except that ""they got tired of me always being sad"" lol, I kept trying to talk to them to solve it and I even begged them to forgive me (even though I had done NOTHING wrong), but they kept ghosting me. Two important events in my life came around and they promised they'd be there, but they weren't, they kept ghosting me. I've had very unstable and on and off relationships with these people for almost 7 years so I thought ok this is my limit. This is too much. And I couldn't say goodbye (my biggest fear is abandonment - of course it would hurt too much to send them a text saying goodbye for good) so I just blocked them everywhere without saying a word. I feel like I'm the shittiest person ever for doing that, I'm scared they hate me or something. I felt sooooo much better after cutting them off - I felt free, and tbh I still do. But the fact that we didn't have a proper closure still hurts me and I fear it will always hurt. I feel like they took a part of me when they left, like a part of me died. I was thinking about reaching out to them just to say goodbye forever but I don't want to talk to them ever again, I feel like it will only trigger me again (we always had like a honeymoon phase after we started talking again, but in less than a month they got tired of me and started being mean again) so idk what to do. Sorry for the rant!"
BPD,fquxshk,t3_gkt32d,1589666161.0,"I'm so happy for you! This happened to me too. Last year I decided to cut off contact with my favorite persons (my best friend irl and my best friend online) and 90% of my issues were solved too. I still miss them though. Do you miss them a lot too? Because sometimes I still feel like ""what if I hadn't stopped talking to them"" and sometimes I feel like I'm trash for cutting them off."

BPDsupport,fqnx6s2,t3_gjwxa5,1589503174.0,"Yes. Honestly, almost every time I've attempted suicide it was only a cry for help. I know it's a really toxic mindset and I'm working on it, but sometimes it just seems like people don't care unless you're dying / on the verge of death"
BPD,fqnb7zv,t1_fqmscj3,1589491790.0,"No worries!!! Omg, maybe she wanted to softblock you but forgot to unblock you afterwards. I always did lol!!! I felt worthless after they deleted or blocked me, like I was uncool. Now that I don't go to school anymore I don't stalk the social media of my classmates who are more popular than me because I don't have classmates anymore lol but now I stalk people who are popular on social media from my city and spend a lot of time thinking how cool it would be to be one of them or to be part of their friend group. Some of them follow me and I'm always scared one day they'll end up blocking me!!!"
BPD,fqmppu7,t1_fqmpcmw,1589481443.0,"LMAOOO I feel you!!! I also used to stalk people who were years older than me! The girls I used to stalk were like 3 years older than me and we only went to the same middle school together, but I used to OBSESSIVELY look at their posts too, trying to be like them and I even tried to start talking/acting like them omg. Maybe she ""cleaned"" her social media account and decided to remove random people? A lot of people seem to do that! Anyways, don't worry too much about it! You're not a creep, I used to do it all the time even with random people online or people from my city who didn't even know me"
BPD,fqmnze3,t1_fqmnjtc,1589480618.0,Maybe that's what happened to you too! When you stopped seeing eachother they removed you from their social media. :(
BPD,fqmnvce,t1_fqmnjtc,1589480564.0,Nah they never knew. We were in the same school and we had friends in common. I wasn't stalking them and planning to do something to them. I just looked at their posts/pictures for a long time and wished my life was like theirs/tried to copy stuff they did because everything in their lives seemed perfect. When we stopped going to school together they removed me from their friends and it hurt like we had actually been friends lol
BPD,fqmmplg,t3_gjqv1g,1589480007.0,"No you're not. The same thing has happened to me. I used to be obsessed with other girls who were more popular or prettier than me, I used to stalk their social media almost everyday, etc. when we had never even had a conversation. When I found out they had blocked me or deleted me I wanted to die lol."

BPD,foca51j,t3_g6nm72,1587668903.0,"This always happens to me. I'm pretty sure someone is watching every single thing I do wether it's online or in real life. It got so bad where I couldn't sleep and I thought someone was hacking even my Spotify. I have all of my social media accounts on private (I deactivated Facebook though, and I doubt I will be coming back) and everytime I get a new follower I'm scared bc I think it's someone who's following me just to stalk me so I soft block them. I'm really paranoid, I told my therapist about it and I was put on meds and they have helped me a lot but the paranoid thoughts don't go away 100%. Yesterday I couldn't sleep because I started overthinking about my childhood house and the complicated relationship I have with my brother and I didn't want to have nightmares so I tried to stay up as long as I could but I couldn't because the meds made me sleepy and when I finally tried to go to bed I couldn't because it was windy outside and I thought there was a ghost or something in my room watching me. I had to go to bed with my Mom."
