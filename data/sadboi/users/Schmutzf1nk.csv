My doctor recommended [Ell-Cranell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfatradiol) to me. For me it reduced the amount of hair falling out significantly and they became thicker. I hope it will stay this way once I stop using it.

reddeadredemption2,fn6wni6,t1_fn6u3zk,1586708803.0,"Okay I watched a mission playthrough again and looked at the order of main missions: 
The order of main missions is basically set. You do need to trigger Bringing Forth Oil II first (John waiting to meet you at the oil wagon as soon as you're ready). Only after that you can start the mission with Abigail (but, if you want to, before robbing the train) . Soo in the cutscene at the end of the train robbery they somehow assumed one went fishing and had the encounter in beforehand. Phew!"

RDR2 for me took another level from the love of detail in gameplay, and by that making it so immersive, to the characters and also how and with what pace you experience the characters. My favourite game of all so far. 
I really have the need to play RDR1 again, as I forgot most of it because it's simply so long ago and I only had it for my XBox 360 which I haven't plugged in for years. I think this will put RDR2 into a whole new perspective and give things even more meaning.

I also remember someone saying, I think it was Arthur, that there was a look in Dutchs eyes in or after Blackwater he had never seen before. It was said along the time  Arthur and Javier had the talk you mentioned, I think. I can't remember if Arthur was saying it to Charles or Javier. So something definitely snapped there in Dutch to start with. I mean he is already paranoid in Horseshoe Overlook, always poking Arthur that he will betray him eventually etc.."

Also, regarding the neckband: the throat has a depression where the sternocleidomastoid muscles meet. As the band is some sort of metal, it won't (completely) bend with the throat, right? If it would cast an angeled drop shadow into this depression, it would make it look more 3D and realistic I believe.

Also I think as a kid he enjoyed the status etc. his family had and the idea of pure bloods being better than half bloods, because it elevated him. But in this part he for the first time is confronted with the reality of it all. With the pure evil. No mocking and giving commands anymore, he's not daddy's boy anymore, he is a servant of Voldemort. And he cannot cut ties and get out because he was born into this. No more fun and games.
