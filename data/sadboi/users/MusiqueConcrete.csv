daverubin,epvox2z,t3_bw5e3d,1559543028.0,"I’m by no means an expert but I think it scales something like this: you hear a vaguely high level important idea but nothing too crazy then your recovery mode is only short-lived, let’s say 1 or 2 days tops. But then you hear Jordan Peterson say that all women are chaos, or Ben Shapiro say that science is unique to the west and what you have now is the potential for your brain to be in recovery mode for a sustained period. This could be anywhere from 1week to a whole year. There have even been reports of Dubinites (followers of Rave Dubin) being completely stuck in recovery mode after listening to Daves interview with Katie Hopkins. I believe the DSM-iiiii now recognises two separate disorders: TBRMS ( Temporary Brain Recovery Mode Syndrome) and PRBRMS (Permanent Rubified Brain Recovery Mode Syndrome)."

In all seriousness, I love how emotionally attached you guys are to him. Ready to defend and fight for the messiah at a moments notice.

Is his biggest appeal spoon-feeding your own biases to you or that he makes some compelling arguments for why you can’t get laid?"

occupywallstreet,epaebyd,t3_bubwl8,1559126609.0,"Based in the UK but it’s exactly the same here. Reminds me of an ex’s mother who made minimum wage, lived in a tiny apartment, had no savings etc but nonstop consumed right wing media, blamed immigrants for her situation, adored the queen and the royal family, despised other working class people and consequently has voted conservative her whole life. Madness"
enoughpetersonspam,epaczbt,t3_buae4k,1559125960.0,"Feign not really knowing who is he “is that the conspiracy theory guy?” Or “is that the dude who embarrassed himself in a debate recently?”.

Lobsters get really upset when the legitimacy of their master is questioned and sometimes that is enough to make them actually look into the content of what he’s saying and potentially reevaluate their stance."
insomnia,ep2ycx5,t3_bttfve,1559014397.0,"I’ve been on this twice for 1yr+ both times so thought I should comment. The first time I went on it it worked wonders for my sleep, within 30 mins of taking it I physically couldn’t stay awake and would sleep for 8-11hours every single night which was hugely beneficial for me at the time. I was prescribed it for sleep + depression problems but it didn’t really do anything for the mood. I also ate like a horse. Huge cravings for carbs and sugary type foods all the time. I managed to keep this under wraps by exercising a lot but if you have a job that has long hours, other commitments or a lifestyle where you can’t exercise everyday I can see how this drug could make you put on weight like mad.

The second time going back on this medication years later it basically stopped working entirely and did absolutely nothing for my sleep. Really strange actually, especially given how effective it was the first time."
selfhelp,ep2vmko,t3_btu7zw,1559013413.0,"It sounds like you’re doing a lot of the right things already (like Meetup) so I wouldn’t be too hard on yourself and also keep going along to these types of things even if so far you haven’t had much luck. I’d also suggest doing a few things that you think aren’t necessarily your normal interests because who knows you might surprise yourself and also make friends through the new found interest. You also said you live in a big city so I would say look for whatever’s going on, whether that’s an art exhibition, a sports event, music etc."
dpdr,ep2ji75,t3_btsu08,1559009106.0,Yeah definitely think it’ll help you. It’s helped me a lot and things would be noticeably harder if I didn’t. Team sports is a good one too I recon because of the interaction with others and shared goal etc- you kinda loose yourself in the moment.
BicyclingCirclejerk,ep24zt5,t3_btkhex,1559002027.0,If you’re even having to ask this question then that should tell you your ftp is too low to post here. I’ll take your Madone for winter commuting and I’d advise you go back to golf.
