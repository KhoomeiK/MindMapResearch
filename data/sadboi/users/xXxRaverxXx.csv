You don’t have to do anything, if you feel like apologizing go for it but I wouldn’t worry about it. 

Like someone else rule 1 about house parties: don’t get caught."

entitledparents,fghu6jb,t3_eycfml,1580793975.0,"My grandparents had a dog- I believe she was a border collie mix with long, black, and beautiful hair. She was abused by the man in her previous home and her name was Sammy- I called her Sam. When my grandparents got her, she wouldn’t leave the kennel they brought her in because she was terrified. I remember the scared look in her eyes when anyone else came into the room with me.

Well, I’m 10-11 at this time and I love all animals and my grandparents had her for a week at this time and she just wouldn’t come out of her kennel so grandma asked me to help her out. At first it was small talks, casual conversation so she’d get used to my voice and my walking around so she wouldn’t get scared and I had the door open so she could see. It took me almost two weeks before I could get her to get half her body of the kennel to eat reluctantly from my hand. 

I kept at her and she eventually trusted me enough to let me take her outside for business. She was skiddish, shy and obviously still scared so she stuck very close to me when she wasn’t doing her business. I got her her to warm up to me and found out she really liked to hug. She’d jump to your hips and lay her head on your stomach with her paws on your hips. She was an energetic little girl, and I loved her a lot. But she was deathly protective of women and she didn’t like my papa at first- reasonable enough. She warmed up to him eventually too and one day my grandma claimed that Sam went to attack the UPS guy at the door. She said she snarled and growled at the guy and Grandma was terrified. She got rid of the dog without ever letting me say goodbye to Sam or letting me take her in. 

I found out years later that Sammy never attacked or growled at anyone-my grandma just hates animals. I have never forgiven her and I doubt I ever will really. That dog was my whole heart at 10-11 years old and I had fully believed that she was my dog because of the bond and trust we had. Sammy had only been with them for a month before grandma got rid of her and my heart aches everyday wondering where she is. Mostly likely have passed because it’s been so long but still. 

Dogs are the best and idk what this lady was thinking, OP."

My husband has been going to the library every day all day to sit by their phone and hope that someone calls but no one does. 

Our WiFi will also be shut off soon because we have zero income right now and that’s how I’m posting this on Reddit. We’re waiting for calls and emails from local charities to help with rent but there’s only so many around us, my baby is due very soon and I can’t work because of that since I’m 39 weeks and my doctor put me on no work for the moment. It hasn’t snowed here and people have said no to my husband asking for small work like yard work or raking leaves-people don’t like to be bugged but we’ve tried. And we don’t get cash assistance from the state so we can’t withdraw money from food stamps either we’ve tried applying for it but they would only give us $10 and in our state we’re limited to 24 months of assistance ever so the department of health and welfare said that it wouldn’t be worth using those 24 months up. I’m just trying to keep my family afloat for just a week longer and I’m running out of options. I can take the post down I just don’t know what else to do nothing is working and I hate not being able to do much

AskReddit,fgek89r,t3_exm9e5,1580701527.0,"A little late to the party but I’ve got plenty of stories unfortunately. I’ll start with the one about my manager when I worked at Taco Bell. This is a little long I’m sorry.

We’ll say his name was Adam that’s not his real name. 

Adam moved to my state from California because his sister passed away (or so he said) and he needed to take care of her house and belongings. Adam was already divorced twice and had many failed relationships. He had hoped a new state would mean a new start for him. So I had worked at Taco Bell for going on a year at this point when I had just turned 18, but I was homeless and living out of my car as my parents were abusive and I left as soon as I could. Adam was 35-37 years old I can’t remember the exact age. Anyway, I was nice to everyone until they proved to me that they were lazy or rude or etc. I got along with basically everyone because work is work and personal feelings drop at the door for me. This wasn’t the case for Adam. 

I was nice to Adam because he was our new night shift manager and he was pretty chilled out on shifts we closed so everyone’s feathers relaxed as all of our other managers had sticks up their asses 24/7. Adam was nice to everyone but he was especially nice to me and he began opening up to me. He wanted to be friends outside of work, and I’m not that kind of person with anyone I work with, it’s just how I am and keeps work drama to a minimum. He would tell me why he moved here, where he worked in California, etc. and then he started showing me his Tender profile and the girls he was talking to which I didn’t find weird at first he’s probably just excited. He then told me later on that shift that he has a daddy kink and liked younger women. Okay, cool some people are into that and it was hitting around 2am at this point so he was probably tired and getting to that honest stage of exhaustion. It weirded me out of course but I didn’t say anything to Adam to let him vent as he had been through a lot. 

After admitting this, he kept talking more and more to only me and only talking to others on shift to give them work related commands. I was just trying to keep his attention of the other much younger women we had staffed and it seemed to work so I put up with his constant conversation about nothing but his types and stuff. Then, he asks me to Big Als (a bowling/arcade type place that also serves alcohol) and I said yes as he kept saying it wasn’t a date, just friends etc. It was also inside this little outdoor mall type place and we walked around since had never been there before and our bowling table wouldn’t be ready for an hour. So we went to this candy shop and he managed to find some alcohol infused candy (I think it was captain Morgan or something like that but it was chocolate.) I left the store before I knew he was buying it because i get stressed out in small crowded spaces and this candy store was packed tight. And in our state you can’t buy alcohol products with a minor with you because yknow state laws which make sense to me. He came out with a bag from the store and hands it to me and says we can head to Big Als now. I look in the bag and what do you know, the candys in there. 

We get there and he pushes the candy towards me, for one he ate he wanted me to eat three more. I’ve never been big on alcohol because my dads an alcoholic among other things so I would pretend to eat the candy and either spit it out while he was bowling, or I’d find a way to not actually eat it since it was dark. He was sweating a ton like it looked like he took a dip in a pool for some reason. Our game finally ended and he drove us back to his house. We went upstairs to his room and he tried to get me to watch some movie but I made up some lie about needed to get to Taco Bell since my best friend at the time was working and was super worried that it was 1am at this point and I wasn’t in the store to watch them clean up before close. So we went to the store and Adam was wildly aggressive the whole time we were there and making really harsh comments towards my friend as he knew she didn’t like him. He would glare at her the whole time, or she’d asked me a question and he would get super mad she asked a question and answer for me. He was really pale and sticky from the sweat so he looked awful. My car was back at my place and when I asked to be taken back to my car, he got mad when we were in his car and asked me “YOURE TAKING HER HOME ARENT YOU??” Referring to my friend. I told him yes because I want to make sure she gets home safe and that’s our agreement. He got super angry and stated that he wanted to punch her because she’s such a bitch. My friend was also just barely 18, and he said it in such a way that I was genuinely scared that he would attack her. 

We got back to the house and I said thank you for the night and basically jumped out of his movie car and left back to my friend. I told her everything that happened and we reported him to our GM and we never saw him again but was told actions were taken. I had never been so scared and unsure of what was going to happen in my life."

I live in an apartment and we keep it super clean however; carpet and wood takes in so much crap as it is and I know the previous tenants did not clean anything ever so it’s more of a safety net for me. I’m also about to have a baby girl and don’t want her crawling in others shoe germs that I know they accumulate.

Her mom seems to be more likely to let her come to us than fight us but we haven’t had a bad situation just yet so I’m not sure but I’m prepared for that day because we just get such a weird vibe from him and have from day one. We’ve got extra things for her to stay in case like toothpaste and brushes, toiletries, blankets, movies etc. She’s just a kid and we worry obviously but there’s only so much we can do which sucks."
JUSTNOMIL,fdn4o30,t1_fdmsw8o,1578577175.0,"Strangely he’s the one insisting he goes.. MIL is just the one embarrassing herself over it. But this man will not be around my child, especially alone and hopefully not at all if I can help it. I’ve never had good intentions from him at all."
JUSTNOMIL,fdmo1pc,t1_fdmmtbb,1578557510.0,Thank you I won’t! My husband has since explained that no one will coming and that all questions are to be directed to him only as I have made my decisions and will not deal with others drama. He told her to stay home and that when WE are ready we can start introductions and that if her boyfriend shows up he will be respectful to all parties involved and that he will not touch the baby.
JUSTNOMIL,fdmnvo5,t1_fdmnptq,1578557297.0,That’s basically how I feel about it. I wouldn’t ask to be there for one of their procedures so why do you all have an obligation to mine? And how hard my MIL is peddling for her Boyfriend to there heavily concerns me (why do you need to see me bleeding or my baby covered in blood?) keep that man back and stay home watch Joker or something and I can text you when we’re ready for visitors
JUSTNOMIL,fdmlqvx,t1_fdmkmza,1578554742.0,"All of these great points! It’s something that I never got to speak to my mother about since she’s passed on recently, but based off how my family treated her this was most likely something she experienced as well. Thank you for point of view and thank you for the helpful advice as well! I’m excited"
JUSTNOMIL,fdmlmb2,t1_fdmeihv,1578554589.0,Thank you! I’m slowly figuring out how to do this and still be nice but firm with my boundaries!
JUSTNOMIL,fdmhzq2,t1_fdmhusm,1578550582.0,"Your absolutely right and I will be updating everyone on the decision. I don’t put up with much now, I’m not putting up with her BS during labor either. That’s probably why she thinks she’ll get away with this; I’ll be too busy to stand up to her in her mind. But your right foot down now stops future misconceptions and hopefully some of her drama."
JUSTNOMIL,fdmhu3i,t1_fdmfdwn,1578550421.0,You’re absolutely right! Thank you for your opinion this helps me a ton!
JUSTNOMIL,fdmht02,t1_fdmg6rr,1578550390.0,lol that’s something I’d say too! Thank you and I’ll definitely be addressing this and shutting down visits and spectators.
JUSTNOMIL,fdmhrht,t1_fdmgdoo,1578550349.0,"I had thought about it and I’ve decided it’s not worth it for me. I’m the kind of person that holds grudges (I know, not a super great trait) but I do and I’m not gonna let this be ruined because someone else wants to throw a fit over someone who may not be permanently in my life. Thank you for your experience! This helps me a lot as my birth mother died in August so I don’t have much guidance or help from someone experienced."
JUSTNOMIL,fdmejh7,t1_fdmdqdd,1578547304.0,"You brought up really good points. I’m pretty sure at this point I’m just gonna tell everyone to wait until i feel okay to see the baby. It’s not going anywhere for 18 years, everyone will have time."
JUSTNOMIL,fdmeg8p,t1_fdmdyuf,1578547224.0,That’s pretty much what I’ve changed my mind to honestly. His family is making this about them and I’m not thrilled about it. They know I don’t put up with stupid things and suddenly they think this will fly and I won’t put my foot down. Just because I’m in pain doesn’t mean I won’t still tell you off.
JUSTNOMIL,fdmecwl,t1_fdmdqjr,1578547145.0,"To be honest I don’t trust her enough to even invite her, I just didn’t want my SO to feel like I was excluding his family. But he’s stated that it’s up to me and me only who comes and at what times. He just will not leave me which I’ve requested of him."
JUSTNOMIL,fdmea1g,t1_fdmdmbz,1578547075.0,"Yeah, I’m heading towards not letting anyone besides my SO to be there in general because his entire family likes to start drama and birth is a very personal thing that I don’t want shown on 4K HDTV. Which is what everyone (besides SO) is acting like."
JUSTNOMIL,fdme5om,t1_fdmdve9,1578546968.0,"As far as I’m aware he hasn’t physically hit her or sexually assaulted her but she knows we get defensive of her and doesn’t want to start drama which is understandable. The boyfriend lies about what SIL does to MIL and MIL just believes him. For example, the other day SIL was going on a date and she told her mom; well B told MIL that SIL snuck through the window to sneak out to go somewhere when she left way before he even got home and MIL didn’t even question why he was lying to her. He tells Mil to take sisters phone constantly, he accuses her of smoking weed and doing drugs without any evidence, but his kids do it and they’re fine. He calls her a brat all the time, and screams at MIL if she doesn’t “discipline” her in a way he wants. I do not trust this guy at all and my SO has always had an uneasy feeling about him."
pregnant,fdiiajk,t3_elfu7o,1578443538.0,34 +2 and I heavily relate I cried to my OB today to induce earlier than the 17 of February I don’t know how much longer I can do this but I will not be doing this again.
TooAfraidToAsk,fcpgo9y,t3_eidm2f,1577863200.0,"My husband is at work and I’m grateful that he has been blessed with a job, so I’ve been cleaning all day long and now am by myself with my cats. I have no problem with this. Sometimes it’s just better to be alone with your own company and/or pet"
JustNoSO,fcbu3y1,t1_fcbtg8c,1577590995.0,They told me that because my license wasn’t updated (but my social security card was) that they couldn’t verify my identity to put me on the account and now they just keep telling us that we can’t have a second person on the account so we just stopped trying. The guy was pretty rude when my SO started the account too but I agree.
JustNoSO,fcbqoot,t1_fcbo05s,1577589909.0,"I don’t know what to do, our Medicaid won’t cover most therapists here and I don’t even know if he’d actually go. The fact that he’s covering up the purchases makes me wonder what else he’s hiding and we can’t afford one not covered by Medicaid"
JustNoSO,fcbqe0v,t1_fcboh03,1577589815.0,"I don’t have anywhere else to go right now because all my family houses are full and I don’t have money to pay them rent so they want nothing to do with me. He’s got my money because he said he was getting some food for us while we wait for food stamps next month, but it was only $20 so I thought that’s what he’d use it for. Instead he’s trying to buy Xbox games when we don’t even have WiFi yet and won’t until January 8th."
Assistance,fbxhven,t1_fbww8eo,1577188265.0,I’m so sorry for the late reply it’s crazy but someone said they’d send money in the morning and I didn’t want to mark it as filled in case it doesn’t get filled but I will update everyone tomorrow if it doesn’t or does get filled. Thank you for your help and concern and I’ll you know as soon as I can!

Etsy,fayge9r,t3_eaqq9t,1576400288.0,That makes far more sense I thought I had messed something up tbh thankfully it wasn’t a client just my brothers Christmas gift
Etsy,fay1qzw,t3_eaqq9t,1576393446.0,Is anyone else shipping with their local post office and the tracking numbers aren’t updating? I’m pretty sure it’s because it’s so busy right now but my latest just keeps saying that the PO is awaiting the items arrival???
Unemployed,fay186r,t3_eaok8u,1576393219.0,My husband is I can’t keep work because I’m pregnant but I’m on bed rest anyways so I’m not super upset. My husband doesn’t feel great about it but he’s happy we have an excuse to not visit family this year as it’s so exhausting
wholesome,fauxbb4,t3_eamfdf,1576353684.0,Okay but wolves sizes are vastly bigger than a huskys size. Even if it could have been a wolf taking a minute to just be sure would have helped a lot. This is sad
SuicideWatch,fad3uey,t3_e8gjky,1575954522.0,"I’m so sorry for what happened, no one should ever have to go through that especially in front of someone they love. But understand your girlfriend is trying to offer support in a situation that no one and nothing can prepare either of you for. What she saw was traumatic for her as well so she probably also needs help.. please for the sake of both of you please go talk to someone separately and then talk to each other when you feel comfortable doing so. I really don’t think she meant any harm, and you are in so much pain mentally and I really truly do hope the both of you are able to over come this. Please don’t listen to those calling you an asshole for distancing yourself, you need this time to yourself to heal, friends like that aren’t important at this time. Please find some way to heal that helps you in a positive and remember to let your girlfriend know that you love her/care very deeply for her still.. 🖤🖤🖤"

insaneparents,f6jj7ax,t3_dr9gbq,1572895533.0,"I completely understand this, my parents also did this and wondered why I left on Thanksgiving as soon as I turned 18 and didn’t talk to them until my mother died this last August. It’s hard for some people, especially Narcs or parents like this to realize that they truly are their own worst enemy. So they choose to blame others usually kids because it’s harder for them to escape. I’m really sorry and I hope you’re able to leave soon and fast 🖤"
gatekeeping,f5rc9hb,t3_dorwbb,1572391891.0,"I’ll never understand how we can fight racism with racism and expect it to solve problems. Fuck nazi, slave plantation owners and the bad guys yeah. But just because of someone’s skin color doesn’t mean they automatically were those bad guys. A lot of poor white people were also slaves for the simple fact that they were poor. No one would care if they disappeared or died because of it. We can’t circulate hate expect that to work for us. Everyone deserves peace and to live in peace unless you’ve done some effed up things. Like I said I don’t get it. I probably never will either because it only seems to get worse."
insaneparents,f5oxvex,t1_f5oxqmi,1572338495.0,"Not even gonna read that whole thing but you can teach them the real world without being a hard ass or mentally abusing your kids. They probably do love you-you’re their parent. But it can be done without this and you know that. If it’s “worked” for you, good for you. See how your kids relationship with you continues and you can determine how you did-I’ll never know that. Berating people isn’t it, leave OP alone and I’m not gonna reply to any other comments from you because I can tell it’ll be talking to a brick wall. You stick with your parenting and I’ll stick to mine thanks. Like I said have a nice day"
insaneparents,f5ox2qi,t1_f5owfmi,1572337173.0,"I don’t think this is the sub for you buddy. No one treats their kids that horrible because they’re 18. And you’ve missed the point, it makes no difference if the child is in college, saving up in a job, or anything “useful” they just kick their child out of the house at 18 years old and expecting to be let into the child’s life whenever they want for whatever reason they want. You might wanna calm down for a little and not jump down someone else throat for something they did not even imply. Have a good day."
