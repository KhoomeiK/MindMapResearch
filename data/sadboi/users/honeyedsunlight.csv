I've been playing Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp a lot, Silent Age, Apple Knight, Granblue Fantasy, and Alice respectively.

I've played AC:PC the most, and I love pretty much everything about it. Unlike other games, I actually wait for items and crafting times to finish on their own rather than speeding them up. ~~Also because I hate spending alternate means of currency in the game!~~

Entire colour scheme, mostly softer colours, in the game makes me feel nice?? I like it c:

Other favourite is Granblue Fantasy, which is a card-based (gacha?) game. It has a lot of loot boxes, great characters, mini backstories for each, and really good art!

I've experienced something similar before, and grieving really hurts.

I think you should talk about this to someone you trust (a friend or trusted adult). 

Also, it's alright to cry if you want to. It always hurts losing people that you cared about. 

Grieving is different for each person. Some people tend to try and take their mind off it, etc. Try to surround yourself with friends or people who you can trust.

Exhibit A:

Dear Roommates,

Cleanliness is a very important to take care of. Especially in a living situation that contains three people. 

As I tend to clean up 99% of the time, I get tired. I'm cleaning up after messes that I have no involvement in. 

\[Insert examples of dirty things they've left to pile up\]

Tell them how they used to help out before, and ask why it isn't happening as much anymore.

I like both the of you very much, and you're my friends. But being the sole person in-charge of cleaning really takes it toll on me.

It sucks that you have to experience this. Maybe research more, or try to put what you feel in more simplistic terms to your parents? If they can't respect your choices, (and in my case) you can't really do anything except wait for them to come around and understand, I guess.

As for your friend, religious beliefs shouldn't come between supporting someone you know and love!! It's sad that you've lost a trusted person.

The best advice I can give you is to see if you can find any lgbt, nb, or agender support groups, alliances, or clubs near you. Because it definitely helps when you can talk to people who understand what you're going through since they themselves have firsthand experience as well.

It's great that you're gonna see a specialist! Maybe you and them can potentially get your parents to understand what you're going through and how important your name and pronouns are!

Focus on the people who are loving and supporting you!
