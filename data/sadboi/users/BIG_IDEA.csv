But no, it's not propaganda that liberals are attacking free speech and gun rights.

And no one is attacking freedom of the press. Trump has said that his adversary this election cycle is the left wing media, but he's not talking about taking away their rights. He made some kind of gallant tweet about shutting down CNN back in 2016 just after he was elected, but he backed down on that immediately. 

Biden, on the other hand, is talking about taking away gun rights (just look at his proposal). And you are losing your freedom of speech under the guise of both hate speech and misinformation. I'm not sure what you mean by ""late to the party."" I've been speaking up and writing essays for years on my campus and so far my rights are still intact.

With JSB you are pretty much guaranteed consistency. Can't go wrong with JSB if you can afford it. You didn't mention what gun you are using but in my magnum I love the 18.13g JSB EXACT. I also tried the new HADES recently and I don't like them. They are too lose in the barrel and ricochet a lot. I also prefer more penetration when shooting pellets.

Others might disagree but I say stay away from H&N. The pellets look and feel high quality but I get mad fliers. I tried the sniper magnum, for the record. You'll see some h&n pellets get flat out terrible reviews, such as the crow magnum. The sniper mags had nice reviews. They are very polished looking in the tin, have a nice 17g, and I can put quite a few in one hole, then one 4 inches off from aim. 

The Hatsan vortex are very, very nice, but also $20 for 500, but they also come in my favorite tin. I wont buy them anymore though bc for that price I'd just rather have JSB, and the vortex doesn't come in a high enough weight for me.

I still can't decide which is more accurate for me, the JSB EXACT, or the crossman premiere ultra magnum. The Crossmans are very dirty and have a palpable seem on every pellet, but these things are homing rockets. At 14.3 grains they fly fast and hit hard. They are less than half the cost of JSB and are available at Walmart. They also come 500 quantity vs 250.

Seriously, I dont get into conspiracy theory, but nice attempt to derail the thread lol. I think that Reddit is now made mostly of far left extremists, which far worse than center right. Anyway, maybe you didn't get the memo that first time gun ownership is at an all time high with liberals forming lines out the door of gun stores?"
worldnews,fpqphyp,t1_fpqndp6,1588828564.0,"I sure hope not. I got blown up in Afghanistan fracturing my hip and tearing my labrum. I haven't been able to move very well for the last  couple of years. I don't have a cache of arms anyway, just a rifle in the closet that I've owned since my medical separation 6 years ago. 

Anyway, a nation doped up on super weed issued by the government while they make laws to restrict more and more of our freedoms isn't my utopia either.

Furthermore, the core idea of the second amendment was to keep the power between the government and the people balanced (seeing as how the founding fathers had just banded together and defeated a tyrannical government). We are the only country that has that right, stop trying to give it away."

Compare that to the 3.5 billion in the lower 48, with our 4 billion unregistered and untraceable guns. I'm just saying it's not a fair statistical comparison. The question is, are you ignorant or intentionally misleading? 


If you ban guns I'll give up my gun, but the criminals harassing people on street will not.

Just two weeks ago as I was walking up to my appartment this 21 year old looking  guy with a bag stopped me on the sidewalk and asked if he could sleep in my house. I said no, and he started rubbing his hands together saying I gotta have something for him. I gave him my subway sandwich that was supposed to be my dinner in hopes that he wouldn't rob me further and then he moved off the sidewalk as if to ""let me pass"". Then he tried to watch what door I was going into but he couldn't see bc there was a small wall in the way. After I got inside I retrieved my rifle from the clauset and set it by the door. Thankfully nothing else happened, but I keep a rifle for home defense for a reason."

There are 4 billion guns in this country, all unregistered. Banning guns from law abiding citizens is music to criminals ears.

While you view this incident as a reason for stricter gun laws, I view it as a reason to carry for self defense. Stuff like this is also why most American families bought a gun recently during the pandemic. It's getting bad out there.

I ended up getting the s2k lol.

I haven't fired it yet but I do like it.  I did a week of reading about it and believe it or not I could not find a single documented malfunction, even from the guys who fire thousands of rounds.  
The biggest complaints are the ergos, including sights, and build quality (even though nobody's has broke).  But for how inexpensive, light weight, innovative, and convenient it is I couldn't be happier with it as a primary home defense tool.  I will likely be adding the MCarbo upgrades anyway, but I'll wait a while on it.  Like you said, Ill likely never fold the rifle, so I don't worry about the mechanism failing.
I, too, have been shooting rifles for 15 years, albeit casually aside from my six years in the Army. I really like the s2k, but it will not be a range toy or plinker for me.  I'll train with it until I'm happy with my proficiency and then hopefully never have to use it again. 
As an aside, I like the s2k so much that I wish they made one just like it (trigger on a stick) except different, if you know what I mean.  Better sights, slightly larger butt-stock/cheek weld, and slightly higher build quality without the folding feature.  I wish that it was locked together like a puzzle (like an AR platform) instead of two halves held together with Loctite.  Hell, I'd give them 12 more ounces to work with if they needed it.
I know you mentioned about 10 firearms in favor of the s2k, but I'm happy for the price I paid and it's place in my home."
VAGuns,fpl779c,t1_fpknoz6,1588707585.0,"If it's not what you meant, then it's not what you meant. But I reread it and it can still easily be interpreted that way, and even when I tried to confirm that is what you meant you said ""heck yeah."" So the only thing I'm confused about is your meaning. 

Anyway, the only way each of us can move forward is based off of our past experiences and associations, and my experience with law enforcement is that they want me to come out on top. Maybe this is because I'm a young white Afghan vet who looks like he has his shit together? I don't know, but I'm not the type of person who forgets their phone number when a fucking cop asks for it. Ask me for it again in the middle of a machine gun fight and we'll see where I'm at.

When I was growing up my dads best friend was a lawyer and he taught me all the ins and outs of the police. How even when they are acting cool with you they are only thinking of how they can get you into custody, don't answer questions just politely let them know you have a lawyer etc. 

But I'm also friends with a cop today who told me his favorite type of people to deal with are the ones who are respectful and fearless, which is exactly how we were taught to behave in the Army when dealing with superiors, and also my favorite type of Soldier after I made sergeant. 

Good luck to you anyway. I'm sure well both be fine in the end."
VAGuns,fpkkkar,t1_fpkimqo,1588696336.0,"Now you are being rude for the sake of it. I was being genuine with you, even when your comprehension skills made me think that English might not be your first language. 

There is no way you are going to forget about your gun when a cop is about to pat you down and ask first if you have any weapons on you (they always ask because they don't want to get stabbed by a knife in your pocket, or discharge a pocket carry). 

We'll just have to agree to disagree, but in my mind a legal carrier should not be hiding their gun from the cops like it's a bag of drugs. You are supposed to inform a police officer that you are strapped even if he pulls you over for speeding. Did you forget that the police issued your permit in the first place? I've never viewed the police as my enemy and they have never been an enemy to me. YMMV"
