Thank you for this advice. My parents and I were wondering if we were being too overbearing about her situation. We weren't sure if our questions and presence were creating more anxiety. I'll try to not be too overbearing but I'm just so worried. I'm kinda afraid when she's out of my sight.

As for the limit on junk food, we have more snacks in our house than normal due to the quarantine. I'll keep that in mind.Another thing that I should add is that she doesn't know we know about the ED. We were suspicious but today I found vomit in the toilet. Should we say anything? I don't want her to get even more anxiety from any confrontation.

Anyways, thank you for the advice. I hope you and your sister stay safe and healthy!"
