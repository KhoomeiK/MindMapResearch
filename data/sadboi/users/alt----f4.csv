BattlefieldV,fkzyzx6,t1_fkzfgpr,1584685070.0,"The At rifles do reasonable damage to light - medium armour if you hit in the correct spots but never use them as you would the cannon in bf1, they lose there one hit kill potential about 300-400m in my experience and are great for picking off true medics as when they try and revive you just take them out

they are really prone to counter sniping thought as they can fire 2-3 shots in the time it takes you to chamber your next round and most players won't bother standing up whilst chambering

As for close range combat I find it's better to use it like you would a shotgun and get in close and pop them dont get me wrong though this only works about 25% of the time

The at guns at not as cancerous as people make them out to be sure the one shot kill is a bit insane but they have next to no use in close range combat

If I am expecting to be close combat as a sniper I use a kar98 with iron sights apart from that I use the boys AT and try to take out players and harass tanks so my team can get those lunge mines in (most tanks think the anti tank rifles Are a serious threat to them apparently)"
