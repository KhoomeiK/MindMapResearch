I think he eventually saw Beyond on Amazon and liked it, and I kind of remember him mentioning seeing one or both of the others and hating it, but I'm not sure.

There's evidence they're genetic, but we don't really know what causes them all of the time. I believe certain causes are known, but both of my parents had them as children so mine are apparently genetic or epigenetic in some way. They're kind of a predisposition as well (think braces sores but sometimes randomly) kind of fade with age and now I only get occasional ones on my tongue because I have a tooth-licking tick centered on my right specifically where I happen to have some rough patches of spotty I think resin that build up plaque. So I'll tend to get minor sores often but they heal really quickly unless I haven't brushed well enough and they get inflamed. They used to hurt quite a bit but I barely notice them anymore.

For whatever reason he just tried to compress it instead of doing something different, to its detriment. We needed an entire film where Luke's entire involvement was slowly working out why and how he got to that stage. Johnson clearly had an idea for Star Wars before TFA in which E7 actually had Luke in it, at least to the extent that we would have explored some of his downfall by actually learning about it in 7 while we're learning about Kylo Ren. I mean... what was TFA even about? They found a map that led to Luke and we met some new people... that was it. Our new characters are barely even characters, the whole trilogy later. TFA should have introduced our characters and given us somebody's entire side of the Kylo story so we could know something really terrible happened between him and Luke that led to both of them becoming cynical and angry. This would have also fit perfectly with an actual sensible story about them finding him. A good narrative would have included more than a magical map fragment and R2-D2 suddenly waking up. They could have run around talking to people who had seen him to figure out who saw him last to track him down, getting snippets of the story and finding out from these people that he was in that state, maybe he was rude or disheveled, stuff like that.

Now for whatever reason instead of just going ""OKAY WELL SHIT MY COMPLEX LUKE THING IS A NO GO GUESS I GOTTA COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW"" Johnson just went with it. Maybe the guy just couldn't come up with anything. Maybe he thought he could redirect the trilogy onto a better course and influence them into making 9 decent. Whatever the reasoning the guy needed more films for what he was attempting and shouldn't have tried to push it into one."

I'd put my money on it just being the fact that Rian Johnson is nice. Anyone of us is more likely to trust a person if we like them, add that too Johnson's creds and it seems like a good match. His work on BrBa combined with Looper is great if you want a somewhat-unknown to develop your dark-but-not-scary second act of a trilogy along the same basic formula as the first two trilogies.
