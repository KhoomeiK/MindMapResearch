NeverHaveIEverShow,fp3038a,t1_fp2djo7,1588270791.0,"she does have a hell of a temper, thats one of the main reasons John McE, a tennis player with a hell of a temper, is narrating her life. i won't ever defend Devi's temper, her selfishness, or her desperate plights for popularity and securing the hottest boy in school. my two step-sisters were exactly like that in high school and it was painful to watch. 

i know, she's shallow, she's boy-crazy, she throws tantrums. and **she pays for them pretty much every time**. she goes to help Paxton's sister? she loses her friends. she lies to her mom about her partying habits? she gets grounded. she lies about her sex life to boost her popularity with her friends? Paxton pushes her away. she complains and lies and is rude....but the difference is that her mom and her friends pull her back into reality as best as they can so they can get her on the right track. 

Ben doesn't have any of that. his housekeeper raises him, he gets whatever he wants whenever he wants it. he doesn't see what he's doing wrong, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when he's still a kid growing up (or as much of a kid as a 15-year-old can be) and instead just continues barreling down a vicious cycle of ""insult Devi, be jealous about Devi, put Devi down, feel better"" when he's around her so he can feel better about himself at the end of the day. and nobody (except for the principal a couple of times) ever puts him in his place! he's never made to pay for what he's done and the words he's said. when people try to fight back when *he* initiates arguments and fights, he immediately does one of two things: 

1. amplifies the arguments and keeps pushing their buttons, fighting fire with fire (and yes, Devi does the same thing. but again, she has people who ground her and she *should* have people who ground her) 
2. threatens them by saying his dad is a lawyer. ""you saw her hit me, right? you know my dad is a lawyer?!?"" 

it is cliché that she falls for the jock. it's a more understandable stereotype (opposites attract, they strengthen each other's weaknesses) than her falling for the bully (they have the exact same interests, they're both fiesty and hot-headed...can you imagine their fights if they start dating? there's a word for that: **toxic**). and thats my two cents. 

TL;DR Devi is a hot mess, Ben is a jerk, and their fights easily escalate since they're both stubborn hotheads. what a pair. only difference is that Devi has a support system trying to help her be a better person. but i'm still not sure a couple like them would last long in the real world because their fights would be insanely destructive emotionally, mentally, and physically when they no longer have friends and family right next to them berating them for their actions."

now they’re growing up and seeing each other in a new light? it’s literally still sophomore year in high school as far as I’m aware. Ganesh Puja happens in late August, so if they keep that steady timeline from ep4, there’s only 2-3 months in total during the entirety of the show. after having been rude to each other (not standing up for Devi here, she a mess, but from what we’ve seen she’s usually only giving back what Ben is dishing out. she hasn’t actively sought to call him names or be mean) for so long, and without any self awareness on their parts for their shitty behavior....again, it seems highly implausible that they’d make a complete 180 and start tonguing each other all of a sudden."

yeah, he gets his sob story, he has to live in this massive mansion all alone with his ""house manager"" with no friends. but wouldn't that make him try a little harder to let his walls down and make new friends? like maybe Devi?

nope, instead he pokes fun at her outfits, her taste in men, her academics etc. whenever he gets a chance. i get its a rivalry, but pretty much everything between Ben and Devi was instigated by Ben making a rude remark.

Paxton was new and exciting, he didn't know Devi and she didn't really know shit about him either (aside from all the classes he's taken for the past 2 years). and yes he's a teenage kid who's trying to figure out who he is in life, and figuring out if he likes a girl or not comes with that territory. but at least he was never as cruel to Devi's face as Ben was *on a daily fucking basis for literal years.*  


ETA: literally both times Devi's mom saw Paxton face to face (the first time, he brought her to the hospital! would a ""thank you"" kill her?), everything that was directed to him coming out of her mouth was an insult. a walking HPV infection? calling him dumb? accusing him of doing shit with her daughter as if she couldn't make her own (potentially stupid) decisions about that?"
