In the dream, I was outside in our old backyard playing. A crack of thunder and a flash of lightning interrupted my fun, and rain began to pour down from the dark clouds above. Frowning, I put down my toys and headed for the back door so I could go inside and escape the storm. But right as I reached for the handle, my dad appeared in the door window and looked glum, apologetic. 

""I'm sorry,"" he mouthed, and locked the storm door and shut the regular door. 

I was in shock. I kept yanking on the door handle as hard as I could, until my pudgy hands hurt. Eventually, I fell backward and stared up at the sky, looked around for help. No one was around, and the world was eerily silent. I screamed in terror up at the clouds, feeling more scared and more alone than I ever had in my very short life so far.

I considered financing an iPad Pro through Best Buy, I considered a Gaomon tablet with a screen ($300) and I also considered an appealingly-priced $35 model similar to the current Bamboo model, but for some reason they decided to make it very thin (2mm supposedly) and people were reporting issues with warping. The Gaomon supposedly has issues with calibration and color accuracy, and both of these models had dozens of complaints with the drivers.

The one good thing about Wacom, really: the drivers are pretty darn reliable.

I went with the current wireless, small Bamboo model in pistachio. I think I'll upgrade to an iPad or a Cintiq if I ever decide to take art seriously, but for now, with my very limited space and lack of skill as it is, I decided to stick to something basic again."

AskReddit,evuw3qd,t3_cl7sij,1564808445.0,"I used to be an at-home caregiver for the elderly and those of other ages who were on state welfare. I went to a middle-aged lady's house where she was on 24/7 oxygen and suffering from some kind of lung disease. She was on the lung transplant waiting list. I did some basic cleaning for her and then she had me go out and buy cigarettes for her. I was too scared to say no because she was pretty strict. So I got them and she started chain smoking them. 

I told my employer the next day when they asked me to go back because I felt uncomfortable about the cigarette/lung transplant thing. The person I was talking to was quiet for a moment and basically said that they were unaware the lady was a smoker (which they are always aware of in case caregivers don't like being in homes filled with the smell) and it was okay if I didn't go back. 

I did some searching online and if I stand correct, our state laws say that to be a valid candidate for a lung transplant, you have to not smoke for at least 6 months prior to said transplant. So I think I may have indirectly robbed a woman of her chance at a second life, or I inadvertently gave her a kick in the butt to quit already. I'll never know which.

But my little town wouldn't give it up without a fight.

So, the whole school revolts against this poor kid. A few sided with him but it was all against one for the most part. The worst part is is that this student was actually part Native American. And that 99% of the school and the town is white. And then the story hit the papers and the whole town hated this kid. Someone even made a Facebook group called ""Kill *student's name*"" where posts were made with threats of violence against him.

All in all, the school went through a long, long legal battle and ended up keeping the mascot, but they couldn't have any depictions of said mascot so the logo and word were wiped from sports gear, gym walls and floors, and paperwork.
