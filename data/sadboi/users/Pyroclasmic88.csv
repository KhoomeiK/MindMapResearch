AskReddit,fotawlo,t3_g9fmfz,1588048836.0,"In reality i would say that any crime that doesn't cause harm to another person should be of no concern to others. Mass incarceration is far from the answer and while there are those who should never see the light of day simply because they are harmful people, murders, rapists and abusers should and deserve punishment. 

The death penatly and life sentences are generally unfair as most crime is contextual and the offender would likely not act the same way if treated fairly and justly, while being given the opportunity to better themselves rather than being trained to be more violent and criminal. 

The United States has a massively fucked prison system that has largely become a dumping ground for the mentally ill we would rather ignore than help. It is necessary but more solid be spent on resources to help them become better people before entering the system. 

Reduce mandatory minimums, stop using private prisons,  treat people humanly, give prisoners a chance to habe a life on the outside so they aren't forced to commit more crime to survive. 

Non violent crimes should be nothing more than a fine. But some things need to be illegal. We need some laws because not everyone has the same morals. When push comes to shove each of us will do whatever it takes to survive, but if you kill; even in self defense, ammends have to be made"
