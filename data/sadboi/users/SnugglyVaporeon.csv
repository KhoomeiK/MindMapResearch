I was just looking at different breeds to get an idea. It was love at first belly rub. She was in the first pen that I looked in. We locked eyes and she instantly rolled over and let me and my fiance rub her belly, which is a HUGE sign of trust in the dog world (So I read). That was it. We had to bring her home. I had to get my change of address card at another location, but when we returned for her, she instantly remembered who we were and was so excited to come home. She is my ESA and she has done wonders for me. I can't imagine life without her now. She is a mini Australian Shepherd named Sapphire <3"
