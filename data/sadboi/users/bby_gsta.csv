EDAnonymous,fpuc18h,t3_gfitjt,1588909279.0,"I can totally relate to this! I hit my LW when I was addicted to drugs and alcohol. I wouldn’t eat for days because of the drugs (coke, meth, molly) and when I did eat, it was not enough for my body to properly function at all. I had chest and muscle pains day and night and was constantly dizzy. Unfortunately (or, well, fortunately I guess) I got into some trouble. Now that I don’t have access to drugs, I’ve put on weight. 

I know if I would have continued with the drug use and disordered eating I would have died, but I desperately miss my body at that weight."

beermoney,fjlr695,t3_fdqwqs,1583452572.0,I sold plasma twice a week for 2 years straight. It’s a great way to make extra money ($295/month where I went). On average I spent about an hour waiting to get seated and 30 minutes getting my plasma sucked out. It helps to drink lots of water and limit fat intake a day or two before. The only problems I ever had were feeling dizzy maybe 3 or 4 times during those 2 years and having the needle miss my vein and creating bruises maybe 6 times. That happened often since my veins were so thin but drinking lots of water helped plump them up. I totally recommend selling plasma if you have a couple hours to spare here and there.
