For all, who will find this thread later- I bought 3x headphones/headset from amazon and compared it carefully with all music kinds- pop, metal, electro. I compared the following headphones:

Sennheiser HD280Pro 135,00 € (lol now they cost 157€ .... what a scam :p)  
Sennheiser HD 599 137,00 €  
Kingston HyperX Cloud II Gaming 77,90 € (from 99,99 € reduced)

What I wanted was a good sound. Because I love music and listen to it how often Im able to.

I was really surprised!  
I send the both Sennheiser back to amazon- a kept the kingston hyper whatever :D I never heard about this brand before but.... they were the best headphones- here's why

Believe me or not- but am not using any mixer or sth like that for my headphones- so I'm just plugged them into my phone and to my PC ....

I came to the result, that the Kingston Headphones were sounding best- no joke.  
Because The Highs of the sennheiser sounded to hard- for example listening to Dimmu Borgir, Disturbed or other metal music.

Kingston just have deeper and better smoother bass.And the best- I can use them for gaming too. You can easy turn 7.1 surround off and on- I will only use surround for csgo or mulitplayer games or maybe Minecraft :D

I'm not a music producer and don't need 5k Bucks expensive earphones.With this headset I'm listening to the music awesome- and I can hear many details, I've never heard before-  
that kind of earphones they are :)"

All the characters ... all their backround histories ... the mysterios atmosphere- ESPECIALLY the atmosphere!! O - O

I'd like to say like the others wrote here, that LOST saved my life in a special way... You know- I'm not sooo religious but... I love all the mysteries about Egypt.... and this civilisation!LOST connected all this circumstances to one thing.

I also had to fight with depressiv thinking since I'm \~13 and when I watched Lost, when I was \~16- Lost helped me A LOOOOT.

Mostly I can identify myself with John Locke. He was TRYING to BELIEVE IN SOMETHING! :'( But he never knew- are the the things happening, because they're intended...? Or do they are only coincidences? John gave me REAL hope for life. To give you an example\^\^' I was really depressed and  I played very often with the dead.... And I have wished for a really long time for a person in my life.... with which I could share love and life-happyness... And I searched for a person like that for more than 9 years since I was 11.... Lost and mostly John Locke gave me this kind of hope, that ONE DAY, something is going to change and is going to be better. That there can be hope, even if there is no hope an no fun in my life.

Lost was a special experience and it is so wonderful (!!!) to read, that many of you guys also liked rewatching this show- I watched it in 2015 for the first time, then I watched it in 2017/18 with my dad and I hope, I can do this also with my girlfriend\^\^ But maybe... I will watch it for a third time alone... because it is a feeling. This show isn't only a show- if you felt the show like me, you know what I'm talking about. ;) 😍

Im from Germany, but I'm really interested in finding new friends from all over the world, I think this could be a great way to.... I don't know... maybe we are going to fly one day all together in a plane and... who knows, what could happen ... :p

Im still loving all LOST memes, even if this show ended 9 years ago.... This show is sooo powerful and hope giving- but only, if you understand the show- it is like music I guess- you have to understand music, to love it. And not everyone likes your favorite music or tvshow. Until today I can not watch GoT because... it is not so interesting for me :/ But LOST....I have the whole show on DVD & BluRay and as videofiles on my computer and backupped in a cloud so I can make sure, that everyone that I love could get the possibility to watch this show one day, if the person is ready for it.

Im out. Thanks for reading, love this subreddit- thats one of the reasons, why I created a reddit account again after months, it's beautiful to see other people who STILL like this show and are on a LOST-Trip their whole life like me. The only thing Im sad about is... that it seems, that not so many people seem to understand (like) this show :/ But we will stick together guys- make some cuty babys guys and tell them the truth about life with this show <3 Ok, dafuq... sry\^\^ You see- I love LOST\^\^"
