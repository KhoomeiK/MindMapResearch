AskReddit,fja4q7z,t3_fc78s1,1583166346.0,"I can’t stop crying from reading all these devastating point of views of someone who was a victim to a loved ones or to a close friends suicide 
I wish everyone so much more than they already have now and to never blame yourself for someone else’s act of suicide.
I’d hate to turn this post about me but I just wanted people who are considering to commit to be aware. please don’t. I just keep having flashbacks of the night I tried to overdose and end my life and it was a horrible few years of my life but we can all come a very long way in less than 5 years. So much can change. So please take this as a sign. if you’re thinking of ending it all, just don’t please. it’s fucking heartbreaking.. I wish u the person reading this all the best in the world. You have only ONE chance at life. do something to improve yourself and even taking a step to talk to someone you trust or a therapist is a massive achievement and a start. Don’t give up, keep pushing please.. ily"

I appreciate this a lot thank you so much :)"

leaves,fhedsma,t3_f2gjqa,1581520197.0,"I’m so happy to hear this & honestly props to you for quitting cold turkey! It’s the hardest thing you can do when you’re “addicted” or heavily dependent on it so I can say that I’m proud for you :)

I need some advise though, I’ve managed to stop cold turkey by physically leaving the country for a couple months and I’m a month and a bit in my sobriety and I’ve had all the withdrawal symptoms mentally and physically but since it’s been over 2 weeks, they have calmed down as I expected. But I still get really sweaty and I’ve never been like this since I’ve started smoking weed and whenever I didn’t smoke for a day I would sweat uncontrollably. I’ve been sweating since I’ve quit and it’s not stopping but idk if this is happening to anyone else or if it’s something I should go see the doctor about :/"
leaves,fhed5oo,t1_fhb97s5,1581519780.0,"I’m glad you’re getting some good sleep that you deserve :)) and yes it’s more likely you won’t be tempted if you lock everything away and don’t see it in your sight! I’m so happy to hear that you’re improving your physical health too. I’ve had experience with a drug counsellor and they provided me with a journal on my progress but unfortunately that never worked for me. Yesss we got this aha :))

ALSO do you get sweaty palms?? I haven’t smoked for more than almost a month now but I still have very sweaty palms (I never used to have this until I started smoking) and I’ve researched into it and it all saids it’ll stop within 2 weeks :/"
leaves,fhb0j91,t3_f20422,1581431963.0,"I’m so happy for you that you’ve been able to get out of the nasty habit!!

I’ve been clean for almost 1 month and a bit and I’ve been able to reflect on myself a lot more clearly and I don’t feel emotionally numb as much and my anxiety is still pretty high but I know in time it’ll ease but I’m getting there :) 

I also had very vivid dreams for a week but it’s calmed down now.

The best way to get out of your habits (especially when you’ve been smoking almost everyday for a while) is to physically get yourself out of the environment and go somewhere with no weed and stay away from anything around you that can trigger your cravings."
