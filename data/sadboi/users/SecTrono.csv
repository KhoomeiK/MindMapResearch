People who become president aren't like your drunk uncle. when they break the law it isn't some impulsive thing they did on a Saturday night. they have plans for the future and know just how they are going to spend their time in office and how they are going to be abusing their powers. they also don't just pick a VP they *think* will let them off the hook because they are a nice person. they pick a VP that they have compromised in a way that they can have full confidence they will be pardoned. i wouldn't be surprised if nixon had dirt on ford before they even ran together.

> The framers of the constitution absolutely considered that the VP would have every power of the President, including pardon - which is considered a VERY important check on the judicial.

of course they did, however, they intended for the VP to be the person with the second most votes during the election. so that means according to the framers hillary clinton should be VP right now. they did not intend for the president to be able to pick their own VP. that didn't start happening until later."

Dyslexia,fr223b1,t1_fr1yc5p,1589829831.0,"this one is a little out of my area of expertise as an accessibility specialist but as someone who has dyslexia i might be able to offer a few pointers.

-

studies have been done that show that the brains of people with dyslexia have to put up to x4 as much effort into reading as average people. in this sense you can look at the problem as being similar to training your child to be a long distance runner while being asthmatic. that being said, i am proof that it can be done.

-

first, you need to fine a way to motivate your child to want to learn how to read. this might not be so easy since, like i mentioned, its a lot harder for a dyslexic person to learn to read than an average person. on top of that there is a lot of anxiety that comes with reading for most dyslexic people. children are naturally curious so reading long stories to them is a great way to do it. try reading something like harry potter to them a few times a week, but do your research and find stories that are award winning and appropriate for his reading level.. if the story is good enough they will want to know what happens next. encourage them to read ahead on their own and maybe even allow them to stay up an extra hour at bedtime to read. don't put any pressure on them to read on their own as that will only make them hate reading.

-

you can also teach them how to use text-to-speech screen readers and spell check. these tools will allow your son to explore reading and writing on their own terms. it might seem like these tools would encourage laziness but in my opinion it encourages laziness no more than a wheelchair for someone who has trouble walking.

-

you also need to take into consideration the emotional baggage that comes with any disability. long after your son has learned methods to compensate for being dyslexic he is going to be dealing with the emotional trauma of it so you will need to find ways to address this aspect of the problem."
Dyslexia,fr11jnv,t1_fr0yoh7,1589811433.0,"so you come here to ask for my input because you aren't dyslexic and don't know much about the topic. then when i say things you don't want to hear you tell me i am wrong. 

-

i am very dyslexic and have worked as an accessibility expert for a while now. if you are a grad student you should know how to do proper research by reading peer reviewed papers on the subject. if you ever get around to actually doing that you will find that the research in this area has found that specialized fonts don't work for the majority of people with dyslexia. 

-

beyond that, these sorts of specialized fonts are extremely impractical. sure, you might be able to come up with a font that is easier for 30% of people with dyslexia. though i kind of doubt it since you seem to have a very weak understanding of how this disability works. but even if you manage to do it, that will only account for about 1.5% of the population. but it doesn't matter because no one is going to actually use the font. it doesn't matter if its free. there are at least 6 other fonts that have been designed for this purpose and none of them get any use. find a new project."
Dyslexia,fr0xc39,t3_gm0ln4,1589808911.0,"i only read/write English so i don't know anything about hindi or any other language.

special fonts like open dyslexic are all marketing hype. they only help a small portion of people with dyslexia. everyone processes symbols in different ways so what works for one person is not going to work for others. some people who are dyslexic will be able to ready a sans-serif font like aerial more easily. others will prefer a serif font like times-new roman.

 the youtuber [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w/playlists) is probably a great place to start out. he has a ton of videos giving reviews of different web-dev technologies. he also has some very informative playlists where he teaches the basics of different technologies and stacks. he also has some udemy courses that go into things a little more in-depth.

-

node.js + express + handlebars is probably your best bet for a back-end. node.js gives you the ability to do most of your back-end stuff with java-script rather than learning languages like python or php. using node you can create a monolithic web-app that works very much like a regular web-page. or you can create an API that will allow you to connect your back end to mobile apps and single-page-application (SPA) type web-pages. of course creating a simple monolithic set of webpages is going to be a lot easier. an SPA is going to be harder to learn how to do but it will allow your users to interact with the web application without having to refresh the page to send data to the server. when a user enters information into a form with a SPA the data is sent to the server without refreshing the page.

for your front end if you want to create a really slick looking single-page-application your options are angular.js, react.js or vue.js."

AskReddit,fpsojgo,t1_fpsdu6t,1588876953.0,that is kind of the hidden truth behind most religions. the one to talk about it most transparently is Hinduism but most of them seem to hint at it.
AskReddit,fpso7om,t1_fpsf7pc,1588876799.0,"interestingly enough, researchers at Harvard have shown that human subjects can at least be entrained to a 23.5-hour cycle and a 24.65-hour cycle (the latter being the natural solar day-night cycle on the planet Mars). i don't think it is likely that humans are from mars but its an interesting fact.

StallmanWasRight,fpq7pwt,t1_fporeso,1588816847.0,i doubt it. most people are too stupid to give a shit about this sort of thing. they figure since its unlikely that their car will store any dick pics they are safe.
StallmanWasRight,fpq7m20,t1_fpoce13,1588816784.0,seems like lazy work by the tesla engineers. its not a lot of extra work to overwrite stuff a couple times.
Chihuahua,fpq7df0,t1_fpq1l1m,1588816646.0,"yeah, people only seem to see chis at their very worst and then judge them by that. but i mean, if some stranger who was literally 25x your size unexpectedly appeared on your territory you might be a little stand-offish too. most of their behaviour makes a lot of sense once you see the world from their dwarfed perspective."

hope things work out. i'm rooting for you."

todayilearned,fplwzj6,t1_fplackw,1588721086.0,We don't roll like that in Canada.  We are all just Canada for the most part.. except the French-canadians... and the native people living in Canada. Some Natives tend not to consider themselves Canadian because that government is more of an occupying force to them. But the people from Korea are just Canadian.
Cryptozoology,fpluajk,t1_fpiw5av,1588719603.0,lol i am glad you pointed out that this is a shitpost because i am too stupid to realize it on my own. it turned my downvote into an upvote.
Cryptozoology,fploknp,t3_ge57nb,1588716504.0,what an emotional roller-coaster that video is. i went from disinterested to amazed to heartbroken. poor thing.
homegym,fplnyl8,t1_fpln7gl,1588716176.0,i was having my friends over a few times a week to work out at my gym before the pandemic hit. i really enjoyed having them over. my only advice is to have them pay $10-20/mo with the agreement that you will use the money to buy more gear.
Dyslexia,fplmxtq,t3_ge3pgu,1588715630.0,a dyslexic person that loves to read seems strange to me. i'm educated and well read but i don't really read for fun. makes me wonder if she just carried a book around as a prop to cover up her insecurities.
homegym,fplmqyn,t1_fplm2ep,1588715529.0,that makes sense. unhealthy people cost a lot more tax dollars than healthy people. that is a solid investment of tax dollars in my opinion.
Cryptozoology,fplmfig,t1_fpk7go3,1588715360.0,this is good to know. when i see spooky creepy pasta being posted i normally just roll my eye and consider unsubbing. now i am going to report it instead.
homegym,fpllz9x,t1_fpll18n,1588715121.0,if i was some rich middle aged dude i would probably open up a nice private gym and charge my friends a modest fee to use it. maybe that is the case here. $100 is stupidly cheap though.

bodyweightfitness,fpl51i7,t3_gdx1wu,1588706494.0,I would go with lots of walking and stretching. If he keeps up with that for awhile move onto jogging and yoga. Old people can do surprisingly well with distance running if they ease their way into it.
Documentaries,fpks8jk,t1_fpkr9lt,1588700137.0,i'm afraid that we might need china as much as china needs us at this point. i don't know how sanctions would work out.

Documentaries,fpkapza,t1_fpjn9g7,1588691224.0,i'm thinking its not so much about the people being Muslim and more about china being a powerhouse. how would you go about saving these people?
