relationships,fmvqmfc,t3_fxp94v,1586427125.0,"""If I don't get his attention when I want it"" - just a small comment on this first; you're not always going to get his attention when you want it. He's allowed to live his life, after all. 

HOWEVER: it sounds as if he has a great deal of time to himself, after work, in the week. He has plenty of time to game and have fun on his own. The fact that you both have less time to spend together at the moment should be a big motivator for him to want to connect with you, even if that's him having you put your head in his lap or on his shoulder whilst he's gaming - something small like that shouldn't be cause for him to push you away or ignore you.

He's being pretty passive-aggressive by the sounds of things, and if he's flat out ignoring you and blanking you rather than communicating, then quite frankly he needs to get his shit together and realise he's being a bit of an arse. You don't get to see each other often, and although I totally get that he loves gaming and gets joy out of it, he's not really participating in the relationship if that's all he's ever doing.

Bring it up with him and be straight with him about why it's shitty for you. Be nice about it if you can, don't give him cause to get defensive, but say what you mean to say and make it clear. Write it down beforehand if it'd make it easier to hold onto what you need to say.

TL;DR: he's entitled to do things he likes to do, but he needs to actually engage in your relationship too."

Considering she's been asking you to go to therapy for six months, and you still haven't 'worked on it' as you said you're capable of above, I'd say that you'd be better off moving forward without a romantic partner. She's unhappy, you're unhappy, and her way of trying to help isn't helping. 

She's worried about you, probably scared of your anger, and hasn't seen any changes since she started expressing her concerns to you; it's affecting her, it's affecting you, and it all - honestly - sounds like a recipe for pain. For both of your sakes, gently suggest you either separate or take a break whilst you work on your problems in your own way. Neither of you are willing to let go of this point of contention."

The point is that she's not giving you what you need, or want, now. She's changed. Yes, in relationships people do tend to ebb and flow with the love - it's not going to be great all of the time - and you need to be OK with that, but in your case it sounds like a total dearth of love or attention. You've brought it up, tried to discuss it, and it seems that her only response was to tell you everything you're (apparently) doing wrong.

You're unhappy. You love her, yes, but you're unhappy. You're doing your part, trying not to be so intense, and yet nothing's changing on her end by the looks of things; at what point is enough going to be enough? You can't stay in a relationship which no longer provides what you need *when your partner isn't willing to make changes, too*. And that last bit is important.

My advice? Talk to her about it again. Gently explain that you're making real changes, have been happy to do so for her and your relationship, but that you aren't seeing things changing from her end. Put yourself out there. Be honest - though perhaps don't accuse her of anything, as that would just put her on the defensive and make her respond as a victim. Just be honest, be calm and say it straight.

If the end result isn't what you need, then you know what you have to do. For your own happiness, my dude. There's no point holding into a relationship which seems - from your offered perspective - very one-sided."

BPDSOFFA,fglefho,t3_eysnnn,1580893493.0,"One person here said that it could be indicative of cheating; as a pwBPD, there's an element of truth to this. Perhaps not physical, but potentially emotional and - equally - could be indicative of her still having feelings for this ex.

I wouldn't say it's definite, though. She may get angry and shut down because she literally can't explain why it makes her so paranoid, or why she feels so irrationally jealous. I know that when I feel pressured or stressed about something, I can find it next to impossible to explain my feelings or reasoning behind those feelings, though I'm self-aware enough after years of working on shit that I can rationalise and explain myself better than I ever used to.

One thing that IS for sure, is that she's in the wrong here. She needs to find a way to trust you, because she's not going to get what she wants: that is, you stopping talking to this woman. She could do with some serious introspection and deconstructing of her feelings; a notebook always helps. If nothing else, she's got to be able to communicate with you.

I hope that it's simply a case of needing to sort her head out, rather than a worst-case. If you can, if you have the patience, approach her in a non-antagonistic way and try to ask her gently why it bothers her so much when you obviously love her and have no interest in pursuing others. It's shitty, I know, to have to tiptoe, and I'm sorry that her behaviour is so irrational. I may be the one in my relationship with BPD, but I've had a past abusive relationship and I know how it feels to be the one who tiptoes; hell, in my current relationship with someone who doesn't always communicate well when he's not happy I can sometimes feel like I'm quietly edging around him.

AMA,fg6x9ge,t1_fg5z7b0,1580579004.0,"Those mood swings are not the responsibility of those without BPD; THAT is the most important thing to say first. If someone with BPD is mistreating you because of their symptoms, they need to access further help.

Because you, and they, deserve better.

I wouldn't even call it a misconception - people with BPD have huge potential to be manipulators, liars, actions defined by their fear of being rejected and abandoned. If they aren't working hard every day to better themselves and control their symptoms, there's a high chance that they'll treat people abysmally without even realising that they're the ones in the wrong. The big thing about BPD is the intense, irrational emotional responses, and the less those are governed and controlled, the worse they'll get.

But, that doesn't answer your question. Advice I can give to you? If your friend or loved one is truly trying to be better, then there are definite ways you can help them. Number 1 & 2 kind of go hand in hand:

1) If they're in a bad way and coming out with waves of irrational emotion, try to allow them a safe space to speak it out. If they're being abusive or are threatening your safety, leave (even if they threaten to harm themselves, just get out and take care of YOU), but if they're just splurging and need to get the wave of feeling out, if you're able to it would be good to just listen. Try not to invalidate what they're saying. HOWEVER - -

2) Be honest. Be kind, yes, but be honest. Don't let them steamroller you and abuse your kind, listening ear. If they're saying things that are absolutely irrational, they need to take a breath and figure it out. You can help them do that by asking them to try and think of where this has come from, when they started feeling that way and why. People with BPD need to deconstruct their emotions to figure out triggers, processes, so that they can tackle them and see things from a rational standpoint.

A notebook is good. It's a prop and useful coping mechanism all in one. Writing their feeling down and then the whys and wherefores is inherently useful, both in the moment to calm them and later to look over and analyse. Sometimes drawing it out helps, too, even just insane scribbles. The key point is that in those moments, they need to BREATHE and FOCUS and try to see where this reaction has stemmed from. If they're not trying to do that and are just constantly splurging feelings, they need to work harder.

But you can support them there. Tell them to write it down, to make a mind map, bullet points, use colours and stickers and whatever else to help them. You can listen, and not invalidate, but not let them take your kindness for granted at the same time by making them work on it in a constructive, realistic way. It's all well and good that they have you to be there and support, but it's on them primarily to work through it. All you can do is sit with them, or on the phone etc, whilst they process and deconstruct.

Most importantly of all - take time for yourself. If it's too much, too exhausting, take a damned break and tell them that you need some space. Tell them you love them, but that you both need to take a breath. If they say they can't do it without you, tell them to use the notebook or blog or whatever they have and that you can look at it together afterwards. Don't jeopardise your own mental health by taking care of theirs. Support, but breathe.

I find it helps if people help me make lists. Even if they're just sitting there whilst I write shit out, it helps. If they want to join in and help - say if I'm trying to figure out what I can do with my life to be happier, recommendations always help, even if I don't use them - that's great. But primarily, just be present.

I mean it, though - if you're closely aligned to someone with BPD, make sure you have your own support network. Make sure you have people to turn to to support you. Loving someone with BPD can be exhausting, and you need to have people supporting you at the same time."
AMA,fg6vlsy,t1_fg5tt1t,1580577907.0,"My BPD first started manifesting when I was a teenager; I suffered some sexual abuse as a child, as well as a great deal of bullying and torment from people at school. The latter was relentless, and it didn't take long for my emotions to start becoming less positive and more 'I am losing my ability to control how I respond to negatives'.

It became so bad that I was self-harming from age 12, screaming at others when they were unkind - ""Why don't you like me? What am I doing wrong?"" - and led to me becoming violent, throwing chairs and smashing lockers, hitting my head against walls. I started life at school as the most positive, smiley and sensitive little thing, and came out of it so incredibly unbalanced that it amazes me that I'm here, 31 years old, and typing this with a somewhat clear head.

I was manipulative towards what friends I managed to get, buying their affection and twisting their feelings so that they stayed with me out of guilt and sympathy rather than because I was worth having as a friend. True, I had some great personality traits, but as I got older I knew how to get things from people and would carefully make sure that I had people on side to validate me when I needed it. I fell in love with a girl and steadily sought out to make her feel that I was perfect for her, constructing my words and actions so that she was unable to think of me badly. We had a very intense and passionate relationship which lasted a year, and as I've got older and more self-aware I realise just how much I'd manipulated her feelings and how close to abusive I probably was.

I was diagnosed first with depression, when it got out of control when I was around 20, but the meds messed with my head and made me feel worse. I was in a relationship at the time (which lasted 10 years) and I was an awful partner, constantly seeking intense and temporary emotional connections with other people to fill the raging hole inside of me. I had a full-on breakdown at university, locking myself in my room for weeks at a time and attempted suicide. After that, my parents told me to come home, and I did. I got a job in the City, and a few years later I had another breakdown and was sent to the mental health unit at my local hospital.

They diagnosed me then with both Bipolar II and BPD. It was a huge wake-up call, and I was put on better, more suitable medication. What they don't tell you about meds, however, is that it could take some time to find the right combination and dosage, so I ended up going absolutely insane - cutting my hair off, more self-harm, signed off from work for a year and a half. I started therapy, and eventually moved out of the flat I'd lived in for three years and back in with my parents.

It was only at that point that I started to climb out and start to truly work on myself. I ended my relationship, started a job in education and started to pull myself up. I went for walks, made new friends, started documenting my moods and thoughts vs actions, forcing myself to become more aware. Unfortunately I wound up in an abusive relationship - with me being the people-pleaser who was abused - and I ended up broken down again, but that set me up perfectly to rebuild into the sort of person I wanted to be.

I had to work hard. I had to truly face what I was like, how I treated people, how deeply I feared rejection and the ways in which I needed to process the way I thought and felt differently. It was a painful process, because I wouldn't imagine anyone wants to see the very worst of thsmelves, but I spent time building my personality to one I liked, communicating with people honestly - after years of being a compulsive liar - and facing the loss of friends of my past who deserved more, and gaining new friends who knew what I had been, and who I was trying to be.

Now? Now I'm on stable medication, and know when to take a breath before I respond to things. Now I force myself to stop in the midst of irrationality and think my shit through. Now I only surround myself with people who know the truths of me, and I treat them with the empathy and respect that they deserve. Sometimes I stumble, sometimes my emotions feel so great that I turn it all inward and want to hurt myself, end everything, a big wash of 'fuck, this is too much to have to deal with'... but I deal with it, find that focus and strength, and I do my utmost to never turn it outward to those around me.

I'd say I'm a relatively okay person now. I'm kind, I'm open, I'm introverted but warm. I have my flaws, good god do I have flaws, but at least 8 times out of 10 they're less to do with my BPD and more to do with who I am outside of it. I love hard, forgive easily and work hard most days to centre my emotions to where they should be. I live in a little house in a nice town with my partner of 3 years, and now have a kitten whom we adore. I'm dedicating a lot of my time in learning how to code, so that I can better my future and get a job within steady, progressive industry. I don't have many friends, as I find it easier to cope and be stable when I don't have too many others in my life, but those I do have I treat the way that they deserve, and in kind I'm treated the way that I now deserve to be treated.

The thing that anyone with BPD needs to know is that it will never stop being a project. You are your own biggest project. You have to work at it day in, day out to get to a place of somewhat stability, and you have to work to be a good version of yourself. It's too easy to feel victimised, abused, to feel as if everything is too much and it's not worth working on it; you have to fight those feelings and realise that you're screwing over not only yourself, but those around you by letting that broken piece of your head win out.

It is constant work. It will take time. There is no easy fix. I haven't even managed to explain everything in this monster of a response, because there's too much to say and too many symptoms that I've experienced to properly explain. But, if you're willing to truly commit to being better, to not letting your mental illness govern you, there is a chance you can have a good and honest life."
AMA,fg6t3bu,t1_fg5s01l,1580576244.0,"Absolutely, however a great number of those people have every right to feel that way. BPD tends to bring out some terrible aspects from people, and without a number of things - proper diagnosis, perhaps medication, proper and prolonged therapy, constant working on yourself and forcing yourself to be absolutely ruthless with yourself when it comes to what you feel vs how you act - a pwBPD has huge potential to become abusive, selfish and narcissistic. I would never invalidate those who have had terrible experiences with people who have BPD, and that's the very reason that certain subreddits which tend to demonise us exist - because the truth is that we CAN be awful, especially if no real and prolonged work has gone into changing the way we process and deal with things.

That doesn't mean we are all that way, however, and I admit that it saddens me to be tarred with the same brush as others who have this disorder. There is always hope and always the potential to break the bad cycles. It won't always work, and sometimes you'll slip, but if you've truly worked on yourself and are unafraid to face the truths of what your symptoms do to you, there's a huge chance that you can be functioning, decent and a great partner. It's just about the work put in.

Hopefully, as more people become aware of mental health issues and the care received becomes better and more accessible, the number of cases where pwBPD are out of control will lessen. Everyone has the potential to be better, and that includes us."

It makes me feel absolutely vicious towards myself, towards my brain, towards any terrible symptoms I've ever experienced and allowed to cause problems in any manner of relationships in my life.

It is, however, super specific in the fact that we're not welcome there. It's for people who've been abused so deeply that they would never want to touch another person w/BPD again, and why shouldn't they have a space? It'd be like if they came into our subreddit and started harassing us when we're talking about what progress we're making; if we try to control the way that they feel, the way that they view their experiences... I mean, shit, we'd become the very thing that they feel we are.

I can say with every certainty that I would never, ever want to get into a relationship with someone who suffers from NPD again. I would recommend every single person who is in a relationship with someone with NPD to get the hell out. It was terrible enough that I can't help but start generalising, and it makes me realise that I can't blame others for generalising when it comes to people like you, people like me; their experience was so horrendous that they would never, ever wish the same on someone else. So they base it purely on their own experiences, as we all do.

I wouldn't want to take that space to express their pain away from them.

Yes, it hurts to be lumped in with some truly terrible people, especially when I've worked for years to get to where I am now... but if we're allowed our space, they're allowed theirs. We need to make our peace with this one."

BPD,f1u61ke,t3_daniz6,1569755090.0,"I've been diagnosed for a good five years now, and can play the role of 'almost normal' pretty well. I know when I'm being too much, I can read when my partner needs space (and so I offer it to him, with a smile and a kiss as I go upstairs), I can feel when I'm being irrational and stupid so can - most of the time - cut it off short. I know that my feelings process differently to his, and that I'm more openly loving than him. Sometimes it does feel that I feel my love more strongly than he feels his, but 80% of the time I can process that and deal with it relatively easily.

It gets easier, the more you rationalise with yourself. It's hard, and it's not ALWAYS easy (some days I feel like I've only just been diagnosed) but you do get better at being okay with the realities of the way we love. I've never guilted him about anything, never made an overdramatic gesture to keep him close, have always fought tooth and nail in this particular relationship not to let my BPD rule the way I behave with him. Maybe I sometimes let it slip, and I tell him when my BPD is particularly screamy, but I work hard to keep it all internalised and work through it slowly, quietly on my own. It's not his burden to bear.

And, when I truly need it, most of the time (rare as it is that it escapes me) he will be able to support me.

Yes, OP, it does hurt to feel that our love expresses itself with so much more fervour than a lot of people's. But it does get easier to process."

You gotta get a job, work most of your week away and then try and find the energy, motivation and spark in order to make those two days (if you're lucky) at the end of it fulfilling. People are stuck on their phones, creating lives on social media and not actually fucking living them, or else they're living a life merely so that it'll look good for everyone who happens to be watching. 

You have to work so fucking hard just to keep your head above water that, for some people - like you, perhaps, or me - it feels virtually impossible to 'do more'. Yes, you could join that social group or club or whatever, but that takes time away from the small amount you have to spend on yourself. So you don't join, and instead feel like you're missing out on something. You have a committed relationship, but you inevitably have to adapt or change in some way, suppress parts of yourself and create new pieces in order for it to work. You put your time, effort and life into so many things JUST so that you can say you're living, but in the end, what kind of life is it? 

We're supposed to be happy with what we've got, with working 40+ hours a week just to have a roof over our heads and taking what we can get because life moves too fast to take our time. Early starts, early nights, time time time just being taken away so that we can't develop, can't experience, can't remember what the *fuck* it feels like to be ourselves.

...apologies for the self-indulgent rant. I'm having a bad day."
ffxivdiscussion,ez6381b,t1_ez5rzj9,1567708677.0,"That's fair, actually. Perhaps I try too hard to be accommodating, which isn't good when the majority of people who play this game (at least on EU servers) have a very low skill bracket.

I stick with my 'I dislike when DPS pull shit', fhough, even if I understand that they may be feeling frustrated. I'd rather people communicated and asked for more. (Tbf, I'm speaking as a Healer/DPS, perhaps tanks don't actually mind that much. When I tanked pre-5.0, I rarely had it happen; it seems to be something which occurs with more frequency these days.)"
ffxivdiscussion,ez41fry,t1_ez01ues,1567679263.0,"Depends on the situation. I don't mind a tank who does a small pull because it's their first time in a dungeon and they want to see what their Healer is capable of. Speaking as the Healz, it says a lot to me if they do that, then pull bigger once they realise I can handle more.

As long as other people don't pull shit, I'm happy if people run ahead. Everyone has their roles, and I like tanks to tank and pull and do what's expected of them. It annoys me when DPS decide things aren't going the way they want them, so pull more when perhaps the tank isn't comfortable with that.

TLDR: I'm nice about things until I realise a player is just shit and isn't even trying to be better."

It's petty, perhaps, but wait for the fucking tank. That's their job. Play the game properly.

I loved the utility. I loved managing my TP and throwing out Tactician & Refresh when my peeps needed it. I loved having to stay on the ball to make my rotation as tight as possible whilst weaving my oGCDs. And they've fucked it.

I don't hold it against him, we're different people, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt sometimes. But what can ya do? No relationship is perfect, and we've chosen each other. We live together. We're committed. I take care to change how I express myself and my love so that I don't overwhelm him or damage our relationship. And I like to think that sometimes he makes the effort to show his love more, just as I make the effort not to overdo it.

BPD,eougmg5,t1_eoudrs4,1558866089.0,"*invades comment*

The hardest thing is when you're feeling great again, because then it's like the instability never existed. The thing about instability, though? It's unstable. If this is a pattern of emotion for you, love, then you *know* something's up and you can't let it slide. The best thing to do would be to start a conversation about it with the sentence, 

""So, today I feel on top of the world. And I fucking love it. But tomorrow, or in three days or next week, I could feel like I want to curl up in a ball and never open my eyes again.""

Or something to that effect. Because the fact is, if it *is* Borderline, that's your reality until you reach out and get help... and even then, it's a long journey. It's still a journey, though, and it's still moving forward, which is exactly what you need to do. This good feeling, this feeling of certainty and happiness is (potentially) just going to bounce back on you and become what you're trying not to think about. 

That said, I know how hard it is to communicate when you feel good. Best thing to do, perhaps, is write it all down - the mood swings, the emotions, be detailed. And then use that to prompt you.

Chances are, if you're anything like me, as soon as you start verbalising and explaining, your emotions will kick in and help you validate what you're saying. If that makes sense. You'll be visually representing how you're feeling.

And if your loved ones have any empathy at all, they'll listen."
