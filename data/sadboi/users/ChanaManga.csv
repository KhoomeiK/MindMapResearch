You’ll meet your real friends there.  Then after school, you’ll get a sweet job somewhere and have the ability to work anywhere in the world.  And all the kids who were mean to you in HS, will be stuck in your town, living boring ass lives.  

Right now the cool kids at your HS may be winning, but you’ll be the ultimate winner of life if you can just stick it out.  Trust me, all the cool kids at my HS are losers now. All the nerds and fat kids from my HS are all super successful and live in big cities making way more money than those jocks prom queens."

Making fun of your weight, your looks, and how you wanted to kill yourself will actually increase your confidence and other people will think highly of you because they don’t have the balls to share their inner demons.  Embrace the pain, use it as a tool, and find peace and comfort into talking about your problems, your flaws, and your thoughts!

If you can get past these next few years and graduate, you’ll find out the everyone in high school means nothing anymore and you’ll find people who felt the same way you did but went to different schools after graduating.  You’ll make new friends, find a community that accepts you, and hopefully meet someone you start dating. 

Hang in there, it sucks but your life truly begins once you’re out of school and enter the world of average people who have the same problems you have."

dating_advice,fi1aqu9,t1_fhztals,1582054017.0,This is true.  One person doesn’t open up a relationship when they want to.  It’s a mutually agreement that’s stems from mutual feelings.  It takes time for these feelings to build up.  You probably built yours up too soon so you have to give her time for her emotions to build up.

Human nature says that women select.  They select who they want to reproduce with which is similar to natural selection.  Saying that, women are nature.  You can’t force it.  Just have fun, enjoy the times together, and over a few months, the relationship will fall into place.  Or it won’t, but I hope it does.  If it doesn’t, don’t beat yourself up."
dating_advice,fhy706q,t3_f5d39w,1581969908.0,"I’ve been in similar situations where I expressed my emotions too soon in the relationship and eventually got ghosted.  It’s best to let things naturally happen rather than force your interest on her.
