additionally, the dialogue is atrocious at one point an actor blurts out the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go knock around a while‚Äù which is basically an old timey way of saying ‚ÄúI dunno dude, I‚Äôm just gonna go wander around aimlessly a bit.‚Äù this was entirely ad libbed and I have no idea if this was the ultimate on film Freudian slip or not.
