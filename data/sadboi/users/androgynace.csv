I really don't think that people will treat you badly no matter what you look like.  I'm unattractive and I have plenty of friends and family who love me and don't care what I look like.  I've just stopped prioritizing romance and sex and started instead working on my career and myself.  If I'm insecure, unfulfilled, and sad, will romantic partners be able to look past my appearance?  No.

People find ugly people attractive all of the time.  I've been attracted to people who I know logically are ugly.  I really wouldn't count yourself and be bitter like that.  Women are likely intimidated by you because of your attitude.  You'll only get stuck in a vicious cycle of bitterness.  I hope you find your way out of that and find a way to be happy."

It's hard so live in a society where we're expected to be perfect.  I understand that the pressure must hurt you a lot when you think that you can't find anyone.  However, there's always someone who cares about you and would be heartbroken if you died.

I'd try to do some soul searching and find a purpose.  What sort of things make you happy?  If you don't know anything off of the top of your head, maybe try getting some professional help for your mental health or maybe trying some new hobbies with friends.  Even if they suck, maybe you can make some funny memories with someone.

It's never going to be easy, but I just hope you can find something that gives you meaning beyond just looking good.  There's so much to life, and all of us are still trying to figure it out.  It's hard, but I'm sure you'll get there someday!"

There's a possibility that he isn't talking to her in a romantic way, but I understand why you would think that and be hurt.  If your mental health is better when you aren't talking with him and worrying about if he truly likes you, maybe it's for the best that you aren't with him.  

Maybe now isn't the time for a relationship.  Maybe you need to find something to be confident about.  I'm sure you have plenty of great qualities.  If you're insecure, it makes it more difficult for others to see what makes you awesome.  Unfortunately, that's another thing that works against those of us who are ugly because we only see that part of ourselves.

You'll never be perfect.  That's okay.  Try to find things to like in yourself and maybe you'll feel confident enough to impress someone.  You never know!

That aside, attraction is very complicated.  What may be attractive to one person is extremely unattractive to another.  If you truly have a good attitude and try to be both kind and confident, maybe someone will find you attractive.

You have to be openminded too if you want to find a relationship.  If you aren't the most attractive guy in the world, don't be expecting all of the supermodel women to be going after you.  Sure, you might get a few 10/10 gals to have a crush on you in your lifetime, but don't expect it to be a rule.

Be kind.  Don't expect every girl you're nice to to be attracted to you.  Attraction doesn't work like that.  Try to socialize without expecting sex."
