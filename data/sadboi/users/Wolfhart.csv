You will bore yourself to death (only bots are doing it regularly tbh), but you will get your token. 

Use druid/monk if possible for this because you will get a spell (Druid's is Dreamwalk) which will tp you to the entrance after the second use.

If you already leveled some other class, you can do a similar thing with Botanica instead. Profits are a bit lower, but you have a route back to the entrance (after the last boss)."

woweconomy,fomj4hr,t1_fomh5mj,1587891946.0,"Sure. To reset the market and be profitable you need to gather the data of your realm and ideally learn the routine of the biggest suppliers. If you know that there is a multiboxer/botter who posts 20000 tidespray every Thursday, don't reset just before he posts. Reset only when the demand is high, but after other sellers posted their stock, so basically when the prices are going slowly up. After that you absolutely have to babysit and cancel>repost.

Still, it is risky and ideally you want someone else to do it while you keep your stock for that occasion. That's because some multiboxers/botters are unpredictable and can show up with 20000 items at any given moment."

wow,fegwk58,t1_feelh50,1579104131.0,"Which isn't true. Wrathion's mother is  Nyxondra, who is Onyxia's sister and both are daughters to Deathwing. Also, mating with Deathwing was deadly to his consorts, but  Nyxondra is (during a quest to protect the egg) pretty well. Even freaking wowwiki has it wrong.

For all we know, Deathwing is Wrathion's grandfather."
wow,fegw078,t3_eor9lr,1579103780.0,But Deathwing isn't Wrathion's father. He was his grandfather. -.-
wow,fefo3kv,t3_eouqk8,1579060600.0,What is dead may never die.
wow,fedb7zv,t3_eoe7rm,1579006394.0,"I don't know why, but it feels like the writers wanted to make a moral point that in the war nobody wins and also it is more important to heal, to have peace, but we had to learn this the hard way.

This would be a good premise for a book, but it's terrible for a video game. Why did I fight for so long if some spineless cowards now decide it was a mistake. I sacrificed so many hours for a payback that is a lesson of morality. I come to the video game to experience different things, not to be given a lesson that could be done better on 400 pages."
wow,fedao3w,t1_fed83u9,1579005863.0,"I too like refreshing old zones and VoEB is a great choice. It's just... These are the only things we are getting for non-raiders. I think that reusing old zones should be done on the side, not as the main content to keep us busy for ~11 months."
leagueoflegends,fe99y1w,t3_enywi8,1578935696.0,"I only play ARAM and informed people in the lobby that if they want me to do something in-game they need to write. I also apologized in advance. In those 3 mission matches, I won 2, but it wasn't a fun experience. Someone actually told me that I should play a dozen normal games before going ranked, but why would I want to do that if I just need to suffer through 3 summoner's rift games?"
pcmasterrace,fe5tmmp,t1_fe3l3px,1578874671.0,It will soon be a year since I had a job.
pcmasterrace,fe362zu,t3_ennfsl,1578846302.0,"What else to do? I mean, I'm useless because I'm not an expert in anything, have no practical skills and no money to go to any course. I don't have a social life because I live in a small village. Playing video games and working out are the only things I can do really."
wow,fe1zpoe,t3_enfta9,1578832814.0,"I'm 335 guardian druid and I'm too terrified to queue for m+ or non-lfr raids. Always scared I'll make mistakes and let people down. So I'm just flying around, doing world quests, pet battles, farming and reporting multiboxers/bots (I know multi is legal in blizz's eyes, but I will still report them)."
cosplaygirls,fdcn68d,t3_ekd3qb,1578279069.0,2B is amazing. Thank you for cosplaying her.

ShingekiNoKyojin,fc9rsgg,t3_eg78zw,1577557243.0,"I jest want a happy ending (I know I'm not getting one) and the happiest would be Eren and Mikasa together, having bright future. After following one other manga which surprised me with sad ending SnK is the last media in my life that I will follow without checking the ending first."
cosplaygirls,fc0yc2g,t3_efe3lu,1577303002.0,I wonder how is it like to be so pretty.
