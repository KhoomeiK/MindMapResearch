If there's a seemingly obvious answer then they will convince themselves that it's wrong and that they can see it because they're just smarter than the people who think it's right

Don't feel too bad about downvotes, it could mean that the person downvoting thinks you're an idiot, or it could mean that they don't really have a counterargument but they just feel like you're wrong and don't want to actually have to accept that they might just be indoctrinated or arguing for their side out of pure habit. More likely though it just means that you already had downvotes, so when they disagreed with you a bit they jumped on the bandwagon

The top rated answers aren't most right, they just have the most people convinced that it's right. Most people aren't experts on a given subject, so an actual expert doesn't have as many people already knowing that they're correct

Redditors love to complain about edgelords, but the only site I've seen a higher concentrations of edgelords is 4chan and at least there it's to such a ridiculous extent that nobody takes it seriously. Reddit is like 4chan if it wasn't a joke

If a Redditor says the words ""false equivalency"" there's a 9/10 chance they don't actually know what it means and are just saying it because your metaphor explained why they were wrong but used a case that isn't quite as bad, even if it demonstrates the exact same point, so they think they can throw a couple of words at it and escape admitting defeat

If anyone ever gives you legal advice here, just ignore it. Always. Literally never take legal advice that you got from a stranger on the internet. They could be a lawyer, but odds are they're just some schmuck who thinks they know how the law works but got their legal education from up their own ass

Don't bother asking for relationship advice. This fall's into the thing about siding against the obvious answer just to feel smart, regardless if whether it's actually wrong or not. They'll tell you that your abusive partner is just exhibiting normal behaviour and that you need to communicate. They'll tell you that your partner's legitimate concerns are ""textbook narcissism"" (which is another pair of words they don't actually know the meaning of). Ignore. All. Relationship. Advice.

If you ask a civil question because you don't quite understand something, there's still every chance you're going to get viciously insulted and not receive real answers so much as more circlejerking. This is just what Reddit is like"

AskReddit,fpzndnf,t3_gg63my,1589020771.0,"From 2016 to about 6 months ago. It started when I came to the end of my degree and realised that I was exclusively qualified for work in an industry I never wanted to work in and couldn't for the life of me figure out what job I actually wanted, thus meaning that I would forever be working solely to survive. In addition, because nothing in my life brings me joy anymore, but I also came to resent productivity because it feels like it's not my free time anymore, I knew I would be using all my free time to just wait for the next work day, which I would just get through because I had no choice but would hate it. As such I had this moment when I realised I would never be happy again

For about a year I was unemployed and the stress put me in the highest category of depression, I thought about killing myself literally every day, about six months into this someone who was a friend at the time moved in and demonstrated to me that he's a massive narcissist who made me worse just to have someone to feel better about himself over. We're not friends anymore

After that year I started working at a company that treats its employees like garbage, including hiring me for a software job then moving me onto a web development job with basically no training despite me not knowing anything about web development. I crashed and burned hard. My time with that company was just hopeless and depressing. I continued to consider killing myself most days, I'd wake up and think ""If I kill myself right now then I don't have to go to work today"" and I'd seriously consider it, the thought of ""Please don't make me go back to *that place*"" was strong. Numerous times I actually had to take sick days because I had been up all night cutting myself and thinking about suicide. At one point I had a nervous breakdown because I couldn't take the stress anymore, resulting in my being up all night very close to suicide (like knife on my throat and just trying to convince myself not to be scared of it anymore and just do it kind of close) and for some reason feeling the need to lie about it and say I was just late getting up, then having a panic attack in the streets on my way into work and having to be found by the head of software and be given a month off work because holy shit I thought I was going to kill people. I never felt liked at that place, they very much made me feel unwanted and unappreciated, especially the head of the software department who just radiated disdain for me. I remember distinctly that I wanted to start doing heroin because I had just given up on the idea that my life was anything like what I wanted anyway, so why the fuck not? My time with the darknet didn't overlap with this time so I had no idea how to get the stuff, but if I did you'd better believe I would have taken it

They ""didn't fire"" me (they just brought me into a meeting with the CTO and head of HR to let me know that it was time for our employment relationship to come to an end and that they wanted to offer me a settlement agreement which would mean us mutually agreeing that I would leave and my only option was to stay and have my performance more strictly evaluated which would be a very unpleasant experience for me, but they totally weren't firing me, just telling me to leave of my own accord or else my life would become very unpleasant) which really was fine for me because I'd already been looking for another job. I'd hoped to have one lined up *before* I left that one but this way also came with a big cash settlement if I signed the settlement agreement, which means not saying anything disparaging about the company (hence I'm not saying the name), so basically buying my silence

In the following few months I was unemployed and looking for work and came to realise once again that I was always going to be doing something I was settling for just to make ends meet rather than anything I was happy with, but this time I had lower standards I'd sink to because I'd become much more jaded. This is when I discovered that using the darknet is much easier than people want you to believe. I no longer felt like doing heroin but I did start a few drugs, MDMA most notably but also did cocaine a few times and tried ketamine

About 6 months ago I started my current job. It's not a job I like but as far as my own ability to like a job goes, it's a good one so I'm in a sort of equilibrium state where I can survive just being jaded and disenchanted with life but not actively sad all the time, just feeling empty and nothing. I still don't think I'll ever be happy again, and I still have nothing to live for, but for now the lack of reason to live doesn't overpower the instinctive self preservation drive, so I guess I'm here"
