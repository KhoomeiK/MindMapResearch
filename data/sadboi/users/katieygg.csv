depression,fcosc2j,t1_fcos7q7,1577840228.0,Okay. Would you be okay talking ok on here for a bit or do you want space?
depression,fcos0xx,t3_eib2q9,1577839992.0,Holidays can be the worst because there's a lot of societal guilt attached to them. One year I spent my entire birthday crying at home alone. Not kidding. It's a sucky time but there is always a tomorrow.
depression,fcorg70,t1_fcorcjf,1577839556.0,Can you find a wrapper or peice of paper?
depression,fcor5lu,t1_fcoqf8f,1577839337.0,Honestly with that then I would find a rock and play with it in my pocket. I did that all through the holidays with my family.
depression,fcoq10k,t3_eib5y0,1577838515.0,"First there's a very good chance you can leave and this could be a very healthy option for you. If you can't or won't (both are legit and okay), can you find something to ground you? Something distracting maybe? An animal, a soft pillow, a strange item. It is Also completely okay to also find some alone time as long as you are safe and able. 

This is your time too no matter what holiday or""special"" day it is. Remember you are allowed to do what you need to be comfortable as long as it does not hurt you or someone else. 

You can do this. You matter. You are wonderful. The universe loves you."
depression,fccz026,t3_eb0ggo,1577604339.0,"Yuuuuuuup right now baby. The stupid part is I will be ""done worth the world"" but still do things that say otherwise like brushing my hair. Just dumb. I did something I regret this time. That's gonna set me back."
polyamory,ew50kt8,t1_ew4xn7v,1565123706.0,Thank you that helps a lot. :)
polyamory,ew4175m,t1_ew3xvwj,1565100383.0,"Thank you. After seeing comments I think I probably should have posted this on a swingers page. We haven't really defined what we are yet but we have been talking for a while about what we want in general and I guess it's closer to swinging. We have tried some swapping in room and that was okay. There were feelings but in general I felt good about the situation. We have been very clear with each other though that our relationship is first priority and what we are kind of looking for is more fwb, not smithereens bf GF situation. 

It just bothered me when I seriously thought about him being with someone alone but I'm thinking that might change once we get to know a specific couple FWB if that makes sense. It just hurts to think about and it's hard to separate all the feelings. It's also frustrating because we have talked for years about this and we've been having so much fun with the concept in general and we even have a date coming up so I absolutely am on board and then the feelings come up. 

He was also my first and only (until very recently) so this whole thing started with me exploring my sexuality and him getting benefits too. But that also probably explains a lot of my feelings. 

Sorry for rambling. Sorting out thoughts is hard."
polyamory,ew3mo0u,t1_ew3j143,1565086691.0,Thank you I will try that. Sorry I didn't mention this but everything he is looking to do would also be something I would do and he doesn't have any problems with it. We are open and loving and he wants me to have a good time and so do I
bisexual,ew181di,t1_ew102tz,1565017383.0,Omg Yes pirates.
bisexual,ew024x1,t3_cm571w,1564973588.0,"You make perfect sense. What you are going through is normal. I remember thinking that when I was your age and analyzing every little detail of my life and actions. I would sit up late into the night worried about what it all meant. Now I'm an adult and I am embracing my sexuality in a way that makes sense to me, and I'm happy.

You do not need to be afraid or hide anything. You also don't owe the world a declaration. Your sexuality will grow with you. It's not going anywhere and you can be patient with it. Love yourself. You are going to be just fine. ❤️ 

If you ever feel like talking, please message me (not kidding I was there girl)."
Swingers,evrluc4,t1_evr5p0i,1564711775.0,My boyfriend and I want this too! We just started and already it's been a roller coaster. Do you have any advice? Could we chat?
