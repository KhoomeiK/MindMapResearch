HistoryWhatIf,f8xqdw6,t3_dzbebh,1574928935.0,"No one is answering, so I'm going to put my thoughts into this first with...
Howard Dean: The early unexpected front runner of the race, had a massive grassroots movement behind him and was the first candidate (second being Obama) to utilize the internet in a way to build up his grassroots movement and connect with the youth, His downfall wasn't the dean scream as said in the media, but instead his downfall was focusing a majority of his ads attacking Dick Gephardt who was in first or second place like Dean, in Iowa primary polls, they both focused their time attacking each other in the state to take the lead, that Kerry and Edwards begin to surge as they didn't focus on attacking anyone and spent most of their time talking to the people of Iowa. In this scenario that Howard Dean does win, the media would most likely down play it, and depending on whether he ""screams"" on his victory speech the NH results would be a win for the campaign of Howard Dean as he would carry his momentum of iowa to NH. I don't think Howard Dean would have a chance in South Carolina, or in the deep south in the Democratic primaries, but he could have possibly carried big wins such as California or New York, if I'm going to be honest in this scenario I see Kerry dropping out, with Edwards or Clark either taking second, or third place respectively as they would split up the south, but still gain a lot of votes there and possibly split the South enough that Dean wins some of the primaries there by pluralities. One thing is for certain, can Dean win the convention? And how will the possible negative coverage of him in the democratic primary and possibly general election coverage, effect him if he does win the nomination? [Media really didn't like this dude before the ""Dean Scream""](https://www.salon.com/2004/01/13/dean_media/) 

Wesley Clark: This is where it gets conflicting, if Clark did win Iowa it would not been enough to win the next primary state of New Hampshire, as both Dean and Kerry were new Englanders, and were very competitive in the state, but Clark would place a strong third place, as he has Southern appeal and appeal in the west too, he would have won the primaries in Arizona,North Dakota, New Mexico (states he did well in 2004 but didn't win) and of course do better in the Oklahoma primary (which is the only primary state he won in 2004) He would never win South Carolina of course, I think Edwards would have still won there, but instead of Kerry being in second place in that state, Clark would have taken the second place spot. Overall I think his primary campaign would have ended similarly like Kerry, but the difference is Kerry was considered a long shot at first, and in the primary season Clark had a large sum of endorsements from members of the democratic primary, senators, representatives, and he was a good friend of the Clintons, he's good with the media, and his veteran and outsider status, as well as rural appeal, (can't forget his anti Iraq war stance) All those things combined that he already had in our timeline, would be greater assets if he had won the nomination all due to the momentum that Iowa created.


John Edwards: in our timeline he already had momentum due to his second place showing in iowa, but let's say he did win, like Clark, I don't think much would have changed in terms of New Hampshire, but Edwards would be in a strong third place, in Mini tuesday Edwards would carry the states of Oklahoma, South Carolina, and if we give him an advantage here, possibly Missouri. In February 10th he would win Wisconsin,Virginia, and Tennessee proving his appeal to rural America in Tennessee and Virginia, as well as largely outside of his roots in the crucial Wisconsin primary, I think Edwards would still have primary challengers despite his wins due to democratic establishment leaders seeing Edwards as an inexperienced in terms of how many years he served in congress (Only reason Barack Obama didn't get as much flack for his experience in office in the 2008 primary season, is because voters really hated bush and wanted change from any form of establishment, in 2004 Bush was disliked, but not as much) Interesting enough I see Kerry or Dean still being in the primary taking wins in New England, or if Edwards is lucky enough, both Kerry and Dean split up the liberal Northwestern vote enough that Edwards could win some of the primaries in those states, but I would say it most likely ends in a contested convention.


I apologize if my grammar isn't good, but those are my thoughts. And this may be an unpopular opinion, but at the start of the 2004 democratic primaries I would say the democrats had a lot of good and colorful choices that represents every base of the party (The centrist in 2004 aren't as bad as the centrist we have running now in 2020, but that's just my opinion."

If i read the post right, you confessed to her? That's number one when it comes to depressed people, girls especially they think people are just using them for self gain and self enjoyment/pleasure, she probably has trust issues, that she can talk to anyone, but has the conscious that she might be used in the process of talking to people.  Second thing is, you gave her the recommendation to get professional help, she liked the idea at first, but after 4 months in, she probably felt annoyed in the fact she had to be there for so long and probably blames you for that matter. Third thing is you're giving her attention, making yourself look desperate which gives her the assumption that you might need her for self pleasure/ just using her. She was in a dark time of her life, and you remind her of that, because for the least you are in those memories, also i treated girls wrongly, and now I'm being ignored by girls which i also did to girls, most likely because we all think we're desperate and want something from each other that isn't geiunue, I'm not a professional, so sorry if any of this doesn't make any sense.

depression,eqgayuu,t1_eqgahud,1560033872.0,"If your dad is always yelling, and your mom is always being self conscious, then we're in a similar situation, but yeah that shit is stressful, we were gonna go places today but we all just had to argue and kill each others vibes, they both came up to me afterwards in my room after we went home, telling me that we can do this again, and I'm like hell no because y'all already killed the vibe with your annoying ass arguing."
depression,eqga9ue,t3_bydhoc,1560033625.0,"Omg i was just about to post something like that today, but was like eh to much work, but I'm sick and tired of my parents fucking arguing with each other, it's not a good example for the familiy, it aggregates the hell out of me, and is probably developing me anger problems like the one my dad has, i just fucking hate it when parents argue, especially when they know the child is still around."
depression,eqg92b4,t3_bydar0,1560033207.0,"What the hell, why hasn't anyone ever confessed to you, flirt with you, are you ugly or is your personality a turn off for people?  Anyways about the coping part, unlike you I'm a dumbass and have rejected people because i didn't fucking know them, and when i did have a girlfriend i didn't know what to do so that shit is dead, but I'm eccentric as fuck now, and no has asked me out since middle school, which was a really long time, I'm a self made disgrace and hypocrite, i feel ashamed for not taking opportunies that others would want, and this is where the coping part comes into play, my brother had a girlfriend but he did some stupid shit and they broke up, he became depressed as hell, and there i was like man relationships fucking suck, yeah yeah it's all cute at first, until the couple argues and breaks up, the average rate of relationships lasting is 2 years.  The idea of flirting to be in a relationship with someone is cute for both of y'all, and enjoyful, but when the actual relationship starts, it's all downhill and goes to shit. To simply say it have the mindset that relationships are ass, but flirting with people and having cute moments is better, so far i haven't really thought about relationships much, because the experience my brother had."
depression,eqg6sbg,t3_byd7uc,1560032402.0,"Depression is feeling numb/empty, unaccomplished, dissapointed, and angry at yourself and other people, if you don't feel any of those things, then you don't have depression. I don't think you're having a rough patch really, i have social anxiety to but wasn't really depressed, now having a rough patch is people screwing you over, everyone telling you to do this and that, having so much work to do and failing at some of those things, but i think you're dissapointed and frustrated, might turn into depression, but what you described isn't really a big deal unless you think about it every day."
depression,eqg2wbj,t3_byd19b,1560030902.0,"No you're not a failure, not a super successful, but yout situation is just average, i think what your feeling is emptiness and unsatisfaction because you probably want to do big things, but don't know what that thing might be, you're just confused now and that's alright."
depression,eqg2k42,t3_bybmwj,1560030773.0,"I just don't care about my birthday anymore, it always reminds me how i age so fast yet do nothing important in a long amount of time, just have low expectations for it a couple bucks don't bother me."
depression,eqg1yl5,t3_bybzbb,1560030542.0,"Nah fam that shit ain't normal in a relationship, she's probably cheating, like imagine if you had a female friend and told your girl you and your friend played video games together or did drugs together, your girlfriend would be mad, This might be ignorant to say but if girls dont have gay male friends, and males don't have lesbian girl friends, Then it's suspicious for two straight people hanging out with each other, because most of the time they develop feelings for each other. Either way don't confront her about it, just get more information."
depression,eqg0vxv,t3_bycijd,1560030116.0,"Yeah, boomers still be on that bullshit telling me that ""You're smart"" like no a smart person wouldn't fuck up many things, I'm just average."
depression,eqg0jgd,t3_bycjqm,1560029977.0,"Like that comment above me said, sex is overhyped, people who done it shoves it off like its nothing, and it's hyped up by a stereotypical mob mentality telling you that everyone does it, when in reality 2/10 people most likely had sex. And even if i or anyone who is a generally unhappy person had sex with someone, at the end of the day we'll be unhappy losers who had sex and no one will care we'll still be friendless. And don't feel like shit."
depression,eqf88vv,t1_eqf83ej,1560016674.0,"Anyways to be serious, yeah that sucks ass and mental torture is to come."
