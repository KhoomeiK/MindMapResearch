MuayThai,fpul0fs,t1_fpufy8j,1588915718.0,"Judo is one of my favourite martial arts but it could be dangerous if done with bad form like in my situation. So I was doing muay thai and I tried to do a move called ""ippon seoi nage"". It was the first time I transitioned from gi to no-gi and my judo style is prdominantly grip work. So what the move is is a shoulder throw where you hook your elbow uner your opponent's armpit quite tight and push up with your legs, but what I did wrong then was I didn't lock his arm in with my elbow and his arm went onto my shoulder and I fell forward onto my shoulder and the impact of his arm on my shoulder and onto the mat badly pinched my nerve in the rhomboid area. Usually my go to move is a ""morote seoi nage"" but without the gi I couldn't do the move. 

So, if you want to cross train to use it in mma or muay thai, don't be afraid just be aware of these injuries, be aware of your abilities of certain moves, drill the moves that can transition better to no-gi and always no when to abandon a technique when it's not working out. You should be fine."

MuayThai,fj91z38,t3_fbx1ql,1583129163.0,"Don't focus on continuous cardio, this is just a pointer to the right direction. Focus on plyometrics or explosive training of your legs combined with strength training. Jump squats, kettle bell swings etc under stress will help a lot. Always go to failure with these exercise to ensure maximum muscle growth, BUT only with the right form. Depending on how you divide your muay thai traininfmg I would focus 3 days on weights and 3 days on muay thai. You will start to see a massive improvement. When you use your leg, you have to understand that your legs muscles are big muscles but also you use other muscles that support your posture as well and those are your lower back and your gluteals, the same when kicking but with a little more emphasis on your obliques as well. Is you don't train those muscles properly, you will gas out fast. Pads provide more resistance when hitting, it doesn't go through but rather a force from the opposite direction when the pad holder hits you kick with it.

The intensity of your training is also important, I'd say you should lessen the power when simultaneously on your weight routine, but focusing on your form. The further your session is from weight training the harder you can go. You shouldn't focus on volume but rather 45-60 minutes of high intensity (5 exercises each session) should be enough (push pull leg split, abdominals daily and neck training at least twice a week). These are specific training for muay thai that I utilise, go for 3 months and see how to goes first."

By the end of the day revise what you have learned right before you go to bed, this will allow information to stick (I don't know exactly how it works but it does not just for me but a lot of people). Wake up and revise it again first thing in the morning before continuing with the next lesson.

This is only to start off, use your laziness to your advantage but don't let it consume you. The breaks in between will help you recover from the task  we programmed out brains to feel comfortable over a long period of time so we have to rewire it little by little for it to do what we want.

You may end up fighting after all but that's the first thing you should look into first.

Secondly, the why. Is it for the fame or the excitement or just because you like it. Let me tell you that fighting and sparring are two different things. They are similar but at the same time different. So let's go through it. Brain injury lasts forever, joint injury is excruciating, nerve injury can lead to muscle loss if you are into aesthetics. My back suffered nerve injury 5 years ago and I still have that tingly feeling amd that's not even the severe ones. You can expect to lose half your pectoral (for example) if you have a nerve injury there, and I'm not talking about half the size but literally you will look like you're missing muscles there.

Unlike in kyokushin, strikes to the face are legal allowing strikers to use their wide stance and not risk being walked down as much by kyokushin guys. A cage to allow space. In terms of striking techniques, anything goes except for groin strikes, eye gouging, punches to the back of the head, etc."

selfimprovement,ffem5fx,t3_esyh28,1579854001.0,"Having ADHD and feeling like someone with ADHD are teo completely different things. I've been diagnosed since I was 8 and truly did struggle all through put school up until now. However, you can't brush this off just because I said that. There a numerous mental health issues that causes people to lose focus and from what you've describes it may be a depression issue. Please seek a mental health professional. Even as someone with adhd, ocd and anxiety I am not qualified to diagnose you because at times I struggle to understand myself.


The only advice I could give you is exercise, exercise and exercise. I may not be an expert in psychology but I do know a lot about physiology, health and fitness. Seratonin is one of those hormones that researchers say it is linked to depression. Not enough of it can lead you to feeling down and shit. That's why stuff like zoloft are known chemically as sertraline which is a seratonin blocker (blocks seratonin from being absorbed into the nervous system). Exercise is a good way to regulate that seratonin."

AskReddit,ff8unb0,t3_es53p0,1579696671.0,"It's mostly the ""unwillingness"" to express themselves... they usually go along with what everyone says or try to down play themselves because they have a geeky hobby. Just tell us that you like pokemon already... I love that shit too. They may also take the.selves/situations too seriously, cracking a joke is non-existing, laughing at themselves doesn't exist in their brain.

Having said that ""boringness"" can easily be fixed and it's not something that you were born with. Everyone has the ability to be fun. Also sometimes boring is a good thing, too much fun can be annoying."
Fitness,fexvten,t3_equx3z,1579437281.0,"Lactose intolerance? I don't take whey, but I control my diet really well. I think you should look into creatine as your main supplement and that's all you really need. If you have your diet together then whey isn't as important for your gains. Creatine is harder to come by even in a healthy diet and it helps you to get the most out of your work-out.

So if you're curious (leaving out dairy):

 Breakfast: usually eggs 2 white and 1 whole, some lean meat (I live in asia but beef jerky is a good substitute).

Snack: fruits, nuts

Lunch: pork loin, string beans and sweet potato mash.

Snack: kind of the same

Dinner: kind of the same as lunch but maybe fish instead of pork.

And I'll take creatine as recommended on the box/tub"

The combination of speed, accuracy, flexibility, power together is amazing. For the athletes themselves, sure they're out there, seratonin rush and they feel good, but sitting at home I don't see how people running around with a ball or hitting a ball is fun compared to a guy who is climbing up a mountain with no safety rope or two people just beating the shit out of each other with techniques from different disciplines or a guy who parkoured around a building while somebody else is chasing him."

We are flawed human, and our ideas and belief is very replacable over time. One of our creation that had been replaced over and over and over again is religion. Gods of the past is now catagorised as mythologies. Stories from the past from ancient greece resembles the stories in the bible or quran on a way.

Number 2. Religious delusion is now a mental disorder. Not back then. We as humans don't have a very good track record of being mentally stable, even if it's very slight everyone has their mental flaws. If we place someone with schitzophrenia back when jesus was around or muhammad was around, he may be diagnosed as a prophet instead.

Lastly, the argument of 2 billion people believing in one religion. Back then, they would have been converted by force and then over generations they grow in number. God didn't put the bible or quran in their hand, but it was a sword on their throat"" believe in our religion or die"" situation. Countries that were taken over would have also been ruled under religious laws and that includes religious education."

I just do my own thing, I have my own goals so after you get to your intermediate level it will become easier to work at busy hours. Trust me.

Low saturated fat diet = low testostorone levels


If you're already fat, however, following a strict low carb/ low fat diet may be best for you. It will not only help you shed the fat but will also put in place a healthy eating habit. Only after you lose most of it can you put it back in your diet."
