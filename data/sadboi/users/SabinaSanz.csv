I'd look closely at that four planet stellium in Capricorn. Stelliums can be really tough to handle (I also have one with those planets on my 8th house, and have struggled with alcohol as well) and those planets together are very difficult because they have conflicting energy. Stelliums contain great potential both for doom and for success. This booked has helped me immensely to understand and handle my stellium (an entire generation has a stellium I'm Capricorn). What I can also recommend is that you canalyze that energy into something like spirituality; yoga, meditation etc. Take a look at that book she wrote it for US, that generation with immense potential and difficulties all contained in that stellium.

Which basically entails very profound spiritual experiences that go beyond ""the guy you met during your first yoga retreat in Bali"" I don't mean it discount those experiences (I've been there and they were very important for my personal development) but I really think these terms should be used with care, respect and knowledge.

She mentions that she wrote the book thinking about the generation born in the last months of 88, all 89 and part of 90 that have at least a 3 planet stellium on Capricorn, sometimes 6 or 7 (like myself) for those born in the winter months. According to her we are brave souls that chose this in order to aid in the transformation of the world. It makes sense if you think that most of us are just finishing our Saturn returns in this year 2020. She says that potential equals the hardships which I can also agree with. She also gives you tips on how to identify the strong energies, ""alpha"" planets and how to manage them. Also, she understands very well what stellium people feel and go through, for example I've been wanting to move (and was in the process before the covid hit) because I never felt like I fit in, apparently it's quite common. Anyway, read it if you're curious it can help you. I wish I did before my Saturn return maybe I'd be in a better place."

astrology,fnweol4,t1_fnw7ty6,1587316951.0,"Absolutely. I have 4 planets in the 8th house and another 3 in my 9th and my true node. It seems to me that I have to undergo all the birth and rebirth, transformation and challenges it brings in order to advance to the wisdom, travel, studying etc that the 9th brings. I think the 8th house is one of the most misunderstood houses."

Thetruthishere,fnuii3g,t1_fnq1ctb,1587262891.0,"It's basically meditation, you have to be constant in your practice, it doesn't happen in a day. 
Meditate picturing triangle or circle of light (white, purple, blue) in the middle of your forehead. After you start feeling it more picture it on the back of your head (around the same height as your forehead). Another good exercise is to begin by creating vibrations in your throat while you breathe, picture them raising to your forehead and then connecting them to the back of your head and then back to your throat, like creating a triangle. Do it everyday for 10/20 minutes. Getting reiki attuned will also speed the process."
