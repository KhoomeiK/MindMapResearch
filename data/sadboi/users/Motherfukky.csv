MDMA,fr2cbfp,t3_gm1xvy,1589834837.0,"Mirroring what other people are saying, it really depends on the person. Some people could do 300mg once a month and never have a bad comedown, but that doesn't seem to be the majority. In general, it does seem to be dependent on dose, spacing between rolls, the purity of your MDMA, as well as other health factors (mental health, diet, regular exercise, etc).

If I were in a depressive episode I'm sure my comedown on 100mg would be significantly worse than the 3 day afterglows I get normally when I space my use by 3 months. I probably wouldn't do it while depressed for this reason. I've also tried out waiting 6 weeks between rolls and it entirely wasn't worth it. I felt distinctly empty coming down and felt like shit the next few days, whereas on Saturday one of the best parts of my roll was how smooth my comedown was and I still feel radiant today!  

I think a good rule of thumb is to not feel too invincible about how our comedowns are and use it sparingly to keep our MDMA use both a healthy and refreshing part of our lives, but that it's also okay to try out spacing and dosing from time-to-time to see what works :)"

Psychonaut,fhxpdz2,t1_fhxne6c,1581959452.0,"There are levels of sentience though, as well as the ability to feel pain. A plant having a physical response to being touched, picked, eaten, etc isn't the same as having a central nervous system in which they're able to feel pain and they're not sentient so they can't process fear. If you were given a hammer and given the option of smashing a tomato or a puppy's head with it, I think that the choice anyone would make is pretty obvious.

Edit to add that the animals used for food live through horrific experiences whether that be from the day that they're born until the day that they die, or whether the terror starts when they step on a truck. Plants  don't consciously process their lives, and even if they did they just sit in a garden until picked.

If she's worried about *you* doing drugs, just present her with the info you have that puts your own mind at ease and see how she feels. Drawing comparisons to safety and dependence on certain drugs vs alcohol is typically helpful in my experience. 

If you want to get *her* into drugs, accept that she may never want to do them and that's okay. Don't pressure her or try to forcefully educate her if she's uninterested. Her fears are valid, just likely misguided. Like someone else mentioned, being surrounded by people who do drugs like at festivals, clubs, raves, etc is a good way to make you realize how it can be a normal and balanced part of people's lives. I was immersed in spaces with strong drug cultures for about 3 years and no one ever pressured me or made me feel bad for not wanting to do them. After a while I realized there were some I wanted to try after I had seen how people were behaving and feeling. If she seems to be interested at some point, let her know it's ok to try out as little as she wants. If she wants to take a dose of something so low she won't be able to feel it, let her.
