We've decided to host a small inhouse tournament among the dev team to test the upcoming playable race of Scarres. Here's a VoD of the final game of the final match.

**How we made this**

We've started the development with a single player mode, but we've always kept an online architecture for our battles. Even when playing in single player there'd still be a server (a local one) and communication between it and the clients. This way it was pretty easy to add an online component to the whole thing even when we were deep into the game's development, took us less than a month to add this mode.
