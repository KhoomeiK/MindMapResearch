I had to be in a ward for a week, but ever since then my life has gotten significantly better. I went back to school after 2 years of not going, Im very close to my family, I have a job that loves me and I love back. My friends are everything to me and are constantly trying to help me become better and to never feel that way again.

I think if I never overdosed I wouldnâ€™t have realized how beautiful my life could have been, I always think back to that day in the hospital crying to the social worker how I just wanted to be understood and be okay. 

Im not fully understood but I am a lot better so I guess thats 1 of 2! It really does get better and even if it sucks again it doesnâ€™t last forever."
