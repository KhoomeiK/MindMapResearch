This also goes back to a thought I've always had.  Why aren't more things built in smaller components, easily changeable, cheap, and easily manufactured?

For example, why not have a car, or motorcycle, and build a tiny single cylinder engine (For example, this is theoretical) built into a wheel.  Then if anything goes wrong, change out the wheel and should be fairly low cost, sending it back in  to be repaired, or refurbished.  Maybe you carry a few spares.

Then, all you need is a base vehicle, a frame, controlled by say a smartphone to ensure engines work together.

Get into an accident?  2 good wheels Left?  Buy a cheap motorcycle frame, and your still mobile, at very little cost.  I imagine a frame can be expensive and have nice extras, like AC for a car.  or as cheap as a few bars of steel mounted to a steering column to make a motorcycle out of 2 wheels."

I eat dry cereal, cheap granola bars, and occasionally fast food for some protein.  Maybe a milk drink to go with the cereal, if I buy a gallon, I expect to only be able to use it once.

Shoes must be able to see the foot on the bottom, or leaking and getting wet before replacement.  Shoes must cost under 20$, maybe 30$ for a good pair of steel toe shoes (Not boots, so they look somewhat professional) but can fit for any use or job needed.

Everything electronic I buy new, I keep track of all warranties, to ensure all computers, tablets, phones, etc. go into a warranty repair or replacement before expiring (It's required over certain $$ for electronics to have warranty).  I've warrantied my PC parts, my laptop, and even my car, got a whole new engine in my car for free.

Make the things you buy last, even though they're made to break, once they get the first repair out of the way, they won't want you complaining again.  My laptop had been through 2 repairs, and the 3rd time they replaced it with a seriously upgraded model, for free.

A computer uses Buffers for everything, meaning it sends data to a holding point of sorts, to pile up for faster processing.  For example, sound may be sent to the sound card built into the motherboard, and video, the video card.

Sound is much smaller amounts of data, and takes less processing.  Video takes a lot of data, and a lot of processing/checks and balances to ensure what is being displayed on the screen is correct.  Sound, simply pushes electrical frequencies down a cable, and let's the speakers do the rest.

This also explains why people buy big massive video cards, for better processing speed, vs buying an audio card, because most likely the built in one is just fine for almost every use.

On an interesting note: This is not always the case, in HDMI, sound is actually used as a way to time the video.  Most HDMI setups will use the sound itself, to ensure video is in sync with the sound.  Thus if you get a stutter in video, you also get a stutter in sound, or vice versa.  I believe the reasoning was the same as above.  It's easier to ensure sound processing is consistent, than video."

Typically multitasking issues may run into both processor or RAM issues.  Try multitasking with other programs, run 2 or 3 high end games for example (You have a nice rig) see if things change.  It's a good testing process for programs, and will rule out a particular program too.

I'll get a bit more technical as to what I would do too:

I would check RAM size and speed, make sure I haven't lost a stick or some reason down clocked my RAM during an update.  I'd also check how much usage are you getting from your RAM?

Also, I just remembered a small tidbit from my build.  Windows ""Parks,"" cores of a processor not in use or not frequently used.  You can check this under the task manager, resource manager.  (Ctrl+Shift+Esc brings up task manager, choose performance tab, and button at the bottom for resource manager.  )

In the new window go to the CPU tab, and it will show each core individually, and you might find some of them parked for some odd reason (it'll say parked on the title description).

First off, why would CPU usage suddenly change?  Then get no real changes from an improved CPU?  The bottleneck he is running into must be elsewhere.  While that is the intended use of the PC, constant checks for bad data can cause the processor to lose some time.

Either way, the processor and threads sent to the processor are only as good as the programmer made the program threads.  I'm just trying to keep it simpler, rather than going straight to a hammer and BIOS updates.  This wasn't an issue on first build, so something must've changed.  What changes the most?  Software.  What piece of hardware dies the most?  Hard drives, moving parts, and SSDs still have read/write maximums (Albeit extremely high and unlikely to fail)."

I really think it would more likely be your hard drive, or your just running into a programming error with a particular game or just poor optimization in a program etc.

These are super hard to troubleshoot, and while everyone here has some useful advice, I've done technical support forever, and always find it's something easy, even when you don't think it is.  The reason I say that, is most devices are powerful, it's the programs and software that are poorly optimized and cause more issues.  Now this isn't always the case, but again, your not overheating, so it's not struggling against heat, which means anything else you can do to help, is at the software level.

If basic windows isn't lagging, or even try other intensive games, you might find it's a particular program, not your hardware.

Again, I'm going off very limited information, so I could be wrong, but I bet you'll have less of a headache thinking of things simpler.  Even our computer parts are made now to be very robust and not break easily.  I worked at a custom computer board manufactuer, putting chips on PCBs.  We used a freaking dishwasher (With de-ionized water) on the boards.  Basically, they don't break as easily as you think, and when they do, they're DEAD dead."
buildapc,fiv2fph,t3_f9rx1h,1582752603.0,"Just going to throw a thought of my own out here, a bit different and simpler than the rest.

I think we're over thinking this.  There's no real reason your PC would suddenly change because of hardware, it's likely more software related.  I would've started with a fresh windows install on a fresh SSD (they're cheap enough if you just want to test, and rule out bad sectors on an old hard drive) otherwise just a fresh windows install is useful.

Otherwise, it's likely just being used that much, or at least the motherboard thinks it's being used that much, because your FSB (Front Side Bus) is maxed out, not necessarily the processor.  So it could be a multitude of things that can cause a change in lag like this.  I don't think it's your processor, based on what I have read in the comments.

The idea there's no overheating, or known issues, it could be a change as simple as power settings moving form normal, to high performance, causing your PC to use all available speed, and you're just using the PC to it's full potential.

Just some thoughts, I could be wrong, but I see a lot of technical answers, and really want to back up the thought process into, what really is going on at the basic level.  I think it's software related, your using the whole processor, and need to sort out what driver, windows component, or game component is causing you to eat processor speed.

Edit: Or bloatware, Virus, or bad settings.  All possible.  Thus a fresh windows install is my first thought."

First off, stop, slow down and realize you're going WAY too far with your troubleshooting, your edit said one thing that stands out the most.

>**Edit:** If it's another clue, I'm not sure if it's standard behavior or not but even in the UEFI BIOS it's EXTREMELY laggy.

If we step back and realize what all the UEFI BIOS uses to boot, you can narrow all the way down.  First off this is a fresh build.  Remove all drives, everything but the bare minimums you need to survive and get into BIOS (I mean no SATAs, no M.2).  That's Power, RAM, Motherboard, Processor, and Video.

Go to the BIOS, see if it's laggy, it's not going to be some speedy place in the PC, but I am very concerned with the BIOS lagging.

If it is still lagging, test how you can.  You probably don't have extra parts laying around, but you can check your RAM physically.  Remove a stick of RAM, test, swap to the other stick, test, etc.

Then build your PC, one piece at a time.  I'd start with the M.2 Drive.  Install Windows, you can update drivers as you install pieces and go.  Each piece forward until you run into your lag.  This will guarantee you find the correct part and warranty it fast.

Personally, I believe it's actually your motherboard, something's wrong, unless your seeing the BIOS incorrectly, and it's just normally laggy like that.  Either way, this troubleshooting method is guaranteed to find your laggy piece.  Don't plug in any additional keyboards, mice, etc.  Start without, then add the keyboard, test the bios, then mouse, test the bios etc.  One piece at a time even USB devices, not just onboard.

Feel free to message me or reply here, I'll help as much as I can, I have some free time.

Edit: I'll go a bit further since obviously the comments point in the same direction.  If you think about it, installing windows etc. should have no effect on a laggy BIOS, however if you get to that step, and suspect it's Operating system, or software related, throw a quick linux boot on a USB, and boot from it.  Won't be the fastest, but should be able to work and again, tell you if it's the drive or not. 

I doubt we will get much farther, you're likely looking at a bad motherboard and i'm fairly confident on that."
homeless,fgegkqd,t1_fgd34ik,1580699055.0,"It's unfortunate and the scariest thing to have squatters in a home you actively sleep in, or just a bunch of roommates who don't care and a house full of people.  It's not fun when a house is too packed or full of people you don't trust.  A house is supposed to be a home, somewhere you feel safe.

But sometimes a house is not a home either, like my current situation, I feel threatened and don't like my roommate since he imposes such crazy rules yet requires me to be on the lease.  If i'm on the lease, I own this house too so I just don't listen to him on certain things.  The rest I just have to eat it for now, it's better than many other roommates I've had (Last one scammed me and a few others of our rent while he had active eviction in process when we moved in)."
homeless,fgeg24u,t1_fgczs80,1580698740.0,"So I could put this in another way too, what I'd do if I were in your shoes.

I agree, given the information, to keeping him at somewhat of a distance.  If they say they're OK, I would only be able to trust them, but offer a hand whenever I'm home they're welcome to come by, shower, or do laundry as time permits.

But I'm also not in a situation to be helpful with household stuff either, as I don't want to get on bad terms with a stickler of a roommate who doesn't want anyone in the house really.  In that case I'd always ensure my friend knew he had a ride, if he needed to get anywhere important.  Job interviews, gym etc.  If I got time I'll even wait for him at the Gym to get ready, and take him where he needs to go.  That way he's not exhausted before an interview or struggling to get there.

I'm pretty broke, but I'm sure a few dollars in gas wouldn't kill me.  If I had more however I'd offer him a couple of bucks cash, because it's easier to hide and hold cash than it is to hide a bunch of sandwiches or socks.  Worst case he can spend the money to grab some cheap socks he's gonna toss anyways etc.  Contrary to what I see many people say, I'm not afraid to give cash to homeless, it's more valuable to them.  a 5 dollar pack of socks to them, may only be worth 50c in value due to weight etc.  a 5 dollar bill might mean more if they were hungry.

Cash is king, it's just simply more flexible to their needs, which are going to be more immediate needs than anything."

Still hurts today."
homeless,fgcral8,t3_exrjns,1580675535.0,"First off I'm going to deviate from what everyone is saying here.  Drugs or not, I don't believe someone should be judged based on what you think.  Especially if they're respectful and don't steal, what you do on your time is up to you however they're obviously in a bad situation.  Here's how I would come at it, from the other side, as a recently and may soon again be homeless person who could use some help but isn't crazy enough to believe he ""Deserves,"" help.

First choose your boundaries for yourself.  Do you trust him?  If you suspect drugs, do you think he would steal to get there?  Find what history you can, and decide how close you wish to let him into your life, and go from there down this list.

If you trust him not to steal or do any harm, and are willing to let him on your couch for some time, do so but make sure you set up a written contract.  I have seen some people go from the best person in the world, to suddenly trying to pull squatters rights and just overall horrible to be around.  Protect yourself first.  If you suspect drugs, but don't have the proof, ensure your friend knows no drugs int he house and no guests.  Other homeless may try to abuse his situation, and if he has a kind (But dumb) heart, he may let them into your home.  I've had this happen to me directly, found signs of drug use in my personal bathroom, next to my bedroom.  Didn't even take them upstairs to the shared bathroom.

This is your friend we're talking about here, protect yourself but try to help them with dignity.  If you don't want them staying at your home, perhaps offer them a time to hangout, tell them you won't judge if they want to shower or sleep.  Often times I would find myself exhausted, even having a car, trying to find somewhere to sleep without interruption.

Help them where they need it most, but don't over pack them.  They may be newly homeless, and not know what to look for, maybe set them up with a few pairs of socks, basic toiletries, etc.  Otherwise, ask them if they need anything.  Don't be afraid to make suggestions, there are great lists on this subreddit.  Keep it light, it's likely to get stolen.

If you believe they are good friends, and want to help them more long term, Don't go too far into your budget early on, personally I wish I had emergency cash once in awhile and know many people who still call me in a bind (Yes even as homeless I usually had some income) and I'll help them get a couple of groceries.  You'd be surprised how much that emergency contact can be helpful when someone's had a rough day and when your homeless, there's going to be plenty of those.

Offer big day stuff, so he doesn't feel hopeless either.  Get a job interview?  Let him know you will be there to, help him get showered, and prepared in advance.  Knowing places I could really shower, do a load of laundry and prepare myself were few and far between.  A gym wasn't always possible based on how much money one has.

Realize they will get stolen from, repeatedly, as i mentioned earlier.  It's not an excuse to get more money from them, it's likely true that someone else stole their property because it's often seen as abandoned by some, or others are desperate as well.  Or even the rare case the City picks it up too.  Prepare for long term help if you want to help your friend.

Bad news is, I have to somehow come up with the money (Which I'm pretty good at coming up with money or a loan in a pinch)

Also part of what I did was I got in touch with the landlord, even though it was by phone, I provided them an update as to the best of my knowledge.  I advised them that any of us staying were all scammed as well, we don't want to cause any trouble and of the roommates I've spoken with, we will all be out by the date and time they requested.

I went a step further to be a good upstanding citizen and be polite, I offered my phone number for any questions, and also offered to grab a maintenance sheet (Which I did) and give them the best rundown I can as to what to expect when it comes to repairs when entering the home.

I've done my due diligence to be a good man, I didn't expect them to, but I was hoping they would say, well since you're not hurting anything... stay until the 31st.

I believe we are already past the court date stage.  Nobody knew about it, but I had saw a letter on the door, not addressed to me I provided to the roommate.  I wasn't sure what it was about exactly but he said not to worry, it was already taken care of with my rent money (Likely a lie) and then with the following roommates money as well.  I even loaned him a few extra bucks as he said he was short 65$ after all was said and done (This I had already assumed was a loss, I just wanted to help)

So the notice on our door, is a notice to vacate or police will be there to escort us out.  We were given 4 days notice basically, and with the Head of Household, I'll call him, gone.  We're taking charge to do something about this, and at least get what we paid for.

Hardest part i believe is they're going to want to recoup losses no?  They're not just going to let us stay for ""Free,"" in their eyes are they?  I mean we could pull squatters rights (I believe) but that would DEFINITELY get them to move to evict us so obviously trying to avoid that."

Hopefully you can put my mind at ease for one question however.

Yet seeing bills for $50,000 for a newborn makes me cringe.  Again, I'm not blaming those who seek and use government programs to aid them in taking care of their children, however situations like this are all too common.  People use kids AS their income now, and realistically do they have other options?  Go work a job, even paying over minimum wage, let's say 20$ an hour.  Then pay a babysitter minimum wage to take care of the kids, and there goes half your income or more, after tax.

It's really a catch 22 here, and goes back to the ultimate issue plaguing the US.  Income Inequality, and lack of power in the labor force.  Power exists now in the job creators, since the labor market is flooded with people needing jobs.  Thus people are fighting over jobs that do exist, even if they pay not nearly enough to survive, it's better than nothing.

That's also why I believe bringing back high taxes on the rich is a definite band-aid to the issue.  Yes it will put money in the governments hands to, hopefully, benefit the citizens.  I also believe that leaving in tax write-offs (To a certain extent) are a good thing, when coupled with high tax rates.  It means large corporations and business owners can write off their taxes if they invest in the economy.  Investing in their workers, local communities, schools, etc.  This still benefit's society, and let's the entrepreneurs choose some of where their money goes, whilst still maintaining a sense of fairness.

Often times hoses are going to fail near the clamp where there's likely more pressure and movement to break it down faster, but typically have some extra space that you could lose a few inches off the end, and won't hurt the hose.

Thermostat will ensure temperatures are being read, and opens for water to flow once the engine gets warm enough.  That's why starting there is most important, they're cheap, and replacement rules them out as a point of failure.

1. Risk it, and go find the cheapest car you can get a loan for (It's going to hurt, the loan I got in these cases were almost max APR, 26%), or if you think your credit is decent enough still, go for a nicer car.
2. Find a cheapo that runs.  Go find the most beat up car you can, that you can test drive, and test drive it for 10 miles or KM.  Make sure it doesn't overheat, and can get you to and from work only.  I'm talking a 500 dollar rusty junker from the 80s if it has to be.  Anything that still drives.  I've spent 500$ and got a decent lil running car.  It was actually a van, lasted a month but that was long enough for me to start fixing it and keep it running.

Edit: Additionally, during a time of cheapo cars, I've had MANY cars blow head gaskets, exactly in your scenario.  2 in a year once.  The easiest way to tell (Albeit not the safest for possibly causing more damage to the car, i'm no mechanic) is start it, and drive.  Does it have power?  If so, your engines is likely ok, or not damaged too badly that you can't limp it along.  Shut it off before it overheats again (Being empty of fluids).  

I noticed a comment where you have ordered a thermostat, that's good and the exact first step to every car I've ever had this happen to, even friends, thermostat replacement.  If that fails, and there are no known leaks such as in the radiator or hoses, possibly water pump (More expensive).  If that fails, engine and head gasket, which in most of my cases made the car a total loss.  Scrap for 300$ since I had no space to park and work on it, and move on to the next cheapo.  Eventually I prefer to get up into a decent pre-owned ride that I have now, and so far so good on not needing repairs that warranty didn't cover, but that just expired...."

I spend most of my time working, and if I do go outside, I just deal with it and try to stay out of direct sunlight for long periods of time.  As I mentioned earlier I hate sunscreen (OCD, skin must be clean).  I really avoid it first, and only use it as a last resort."

Cursed_Images,fdu6ykv,t1_fdtzt70,1578728664.0,"I feel you, however this is me naturally.  I don't actually like sunscreen, but I pretty much must use it.

1 hr in the sun, and just the tips of my ears will burn so bad they will blister, puff out like an elf, and bleed.  If I go out in the sun, I have to be completely covered, or put sunscreen on even the tiniest pieces showing.

I once got sunburned through sunscreen so badly within just a few hours, the next day my friend peeled a piece off my back, a sheet larger than a standard piece of paper (That's how we measured it).  It was painful, but luckily hadn't reached the point of bleeding/cracking, possibly due to the sunscreen.

TL:DR - While in the picture it shows him in pain, the process hurts, however it's actually somewhat relieving once that layer of skin is gone, it's like a minty feeling for your skin.  It burns so cool.

Edit: forgot my elf analogy."
TalesFromYourServer,fdpsc74,t3_emi4yl,1578638590.0,"I am not a lawyer, but I know this law well, and have filed a complaint with the correct departments.  I'm from Oregon, and would contact the Bureau of Labor Industries, Wage and Hour Division, Look for the Wage and Hour Division of your particular state.

First I'm a bit confused, but I'm going to operate under one assumption, you've lost a significant amount of money on your check.  (I'm not sure how you lose 2200 on a single check, either you get paid a lot per hour, or your paid monthly and lost almost your entire check, but that doesn't matter for the sake of this argument).

TL:DR - In my state, if undisputed (Which this shouldn't be being disputed) they have to fix this within 3 business days if it's over 5% of your check, and it sounds like it.

Longer Version

This is definitely illegal as many have stated (Again I'm not a lawyer, obligatory).  First off filing with the Wage and Hour division should get you a quick response from them, however not a quick resolution.  As others have stated, file with the Wage and Hour Division FIRST if you think for ANY reason that your job will retaliate.  Think logically, yes you're protected, but as others have stated it doesn't mean they won't look for a way to get rid of you fast for any other reason, or none at all.  Even if you file, it is still possible, however much more difficult as it looks suspicious.

This sounds like it's being disputed by the employer (Which really it should be open and shut in your favor IMO).  In that case it can take awhile by official means.  In OR I would just go ahead and expect a month. 

However, it shouldn't be being disputed, and thus this must be fixed fast by them (Depending on state specific laws) For example in my state in just 3 business days if over 5% of your gross wages.  Less than can wait until next check.

They must respond fast in my state (Oregon).  This is from the BOLI: WHD (Bureau Of Labor Industries, Wage and Hour Division)

"" When the employer has been notified the employee has been underpaid and there is no dispute, the employee must be paid the undisputed underpaid wages regardless of the cause of the underpayment.    
   
When the underpayment is less than five percent of the employee’s gross wages, the amount may be paid on the next regular payday.  If the underpayment is more than five percent of the gross, the amount must be paid to the employee within three business days. ORS 652.120(5).""

In the end I'm almost 100% certain all states have similar laws, you just need to know the exact details of your law.  I can drag this out much longer talking about what your employer might owe, but that gets into a whole new territory.  The way I understand it for example in OR, that if I lost hours, wages, or tips during this time period I may be entitled to compensation from my employer whether I worked or not."

I won't come at you with anything rude, just a simple answer of opinion definitely not a lawyer or professional. I just read up on laws that typically affect me, and I'm not from Ontario. Here's what I do know, and I do say this with fair confidence and from a tenant's standpoint and even what I think of costs etc. Honest opinions.

If you provide the appliances, you must repair them. Similar laws are used in the US, and I've rented apartments without washers and driers, but with hookups available for washer and dryers.

In these situations it was understood that the tenant is responsible for providing the appliances, and thus the repairs on the washer an driers, and as I understand the same section you have provided, that responsibility is the same.

I really doubt you want to try to rent an apartment without a stove or refrigerator, but i feel that would fall under the same category (I want to say I've seen it too!), if you don't provide them but provide hookups, it would fall under their responsibilities. You may lose some renters if you do.

I have seen situations where a washer and dryer has not been provided, as laundromats can be used. Most larger complexes or even small to mid size provide an on site laundromat with coin operated machines.

The biggest deal here is value of apartment vs cost of living. If I were to look at a place where I had to purchase all the appliances, I'd be seriously comparing the costs to ensure my savings per month would match the cost of providing said appliances within a reasonable time frame. You may not get me as a renter if your rent is similar to others, it would have to be significantly cheaper, and in that sense appealing to some such as myself.

Also, you might get them putting cheap, or half broken appliances in. Then the property gets damaged.... Just another thought.

Edits: Clarifying that I'm looking at this from a tenant's side of view, and as unbiased at possible. I might even rent such an apartment if savings were good enough. Then I feel I could get an awesome fridge, maybe a great stove etc."

depression_memes,fcpl2of,t1_fcpj1xm,1577866674.0,"Honest answer, most of it was multiple calls in a day, I would call, get a list of random places that could ""Help.""   
 I'd get 3 or 4 references, and call each and everyone one of them, usually never reach a person or never get a callback.

Typically the situation being trying to find housing.  I'm having issues finding a room to rent, with income and money in hand.  I have been robbed of rent money and just wanted somewhere to stay that wouldn't steal my rent money and wasn't as expensive as a hotel.  I have money for a room, not a whole apartment (Nobody can afford a studio at 1200 a month).

Rinse, and repeat throughout the day and into the night can make 20 calls in a day.  They even started auto transferring me to a supervisor (I suspect because I always kept moving so they couldn't default to sending authorities to come beat me up, kidnap me, and tell me to stop calling which is pretty much all police/hospitals do.)

Luckily right now I seem to be in an OK situation with a temporary room for rent, no thanks to them, however I'll admit I'm under full stress and anxiety because I came back home to an eviction notice posted on the door a few days after moving in, dated for a few weeks before my paid time is up.  The roommate I made an agreement with does seem legitimate, and states my money was to fix that and it's already taken care of, just the paperwork company couldn't be stopped before the holidays.  (If anyone wants to chime in here and give me some input or opinions I wouldn't mind, good or bad I don't know what to think and have already been scammed once, and wasted money on other situations to a point I'm burning fast)

So it was more like 10 to 20 calls a day for 3-5 days until I just completely gave up.  I was starting to get duplicate numbers and support locations.  They'd have me call 211, but 211 was just about as useless except they were more rude about it considering my mind state at the time."
