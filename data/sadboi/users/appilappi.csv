abusiveparents,fqzbl9x,t1_fqx1jm0,1589763947.0,It doesn’t matter your response. I can feel depressed too. It comes with it I guess. But the important thing I believe is to keep one’s principles intact throughout it all. Then one day you may summon them and talk about them. And not lose who you are. I think when you lose that it will be harder to come back from
narcissisticparents,fpjju03,t1_fpe6xtc,1588671203.0,I absolutely agree. If anything a narc will draw satisfaction from it. I used to think it was just me as a child and something I had done but could never have. The validation. Now today as an adult it’s so very clear that there was something wrong with them the whole time. And now in the days of the internet draw strength that so many family members can be the same.
narcissisticparents,fpjjqfk,t1_fpegz15,1588671099.0,I agree sometimes I imagine seeing their dead body and then what’s in me changes. I feel it’s the subconscious erupting through. It doesn’t help with the pain though. But I’m glad I have this feeling. It feels like a starting point to tell me where to begin and that something is wrong. The older I get the more I feel grateful for my feelings. And what my mind is telling me. I feel calmer some days. But I do hope that she hears my pain before she does ever leave this world.
ptsd,fpigvw1,t3_gddt0n,1588640652.0,It’s so beautiful and amazing to even recognise it. It shows your inner warmth and humanity before you had this. And it will always be a route back as a result. I am sending much love and grace and peace.
narcissisticparents,fpcwd0m,t1_fpcun0o,1588514421.0,What’s the right approach? I am in so much pain.
narcissisticparents,fpcw9zu,t1_fpcflvs,1588514365.0,I feel she needs to hear my pain and realise her own views on the world aren’t valid especially in how she treats other people that is her own children. How do I get back at her how do I make her realise the truth than try to control the world her way all the time? Do I use truth kindness or the hard line? It feels to me criminal and criminal minded the whole lot of it in her behaviour like a complete disregard for other people and their own lives. What’s the approach with such people?
narcissisticparents,fnyc3i0,t1_fny46hm,1587358799.0,This is so useful thank you so much!
mentalhealth,fnmmg29,t1_fnf82o8,1587074087.0,"I’m glad you got that off your chest, and I hope you feel better for it. It feels honest and clean and healing. I hung out with the absolute wrong people myself at school, and actually, these are the very people I am referring to in my post. I have to say I never did play them at their own game and just let it be. But eventually I knew it was destroying me slowly but surely because I would grow angry and resentful and eventually depressed. But I knew I would rather enjoy the time than fight or get hurt and hurt others, but with such a group, how naive I was. But in some sense I am glad that I didn’t even with all of the pain and torment because I can look at myself and feel proud of who I am and have some sense of a person to leave with and start afresh with a new group of people which is what I did. But what I do regret is having done it and broken off to have made it absolutely permanent so they would never ever have access to my life ever again. It was hard however given that they creeped into my life and befriended my siblings as a result. When my siblings saw me as “the original friend” or that they were “my friends” as a result. I felt it in all honesty as they were some clique that formed around me because they had nowhere else to go after school and just tried to keep it going. But now that that is over I am so much more lighter and I finally feel that I own myself and my sense of self and how I want people to see me. We make so many messed up decisions in our adolescence and I always tell myself to just try and forgive myself and not blame myself because there were not many other references around and there were too many other strings around them in that like I said before other siblings and our parents knew each other. But now that I have woken up I can safely say that that period is over. And I am to simply take better care of myself and disentangle the past in my own time and safely know that whatever the costs, whatever the costs, I didn’t stay forever, and I am finally finally out with some semblance of myself before I became like them, as a result. And that I can feel proud about as a result. I wish you the best too in your reflections on it all :)"
mentalhealth,fngvoj3,t1_fngh8l4,1586946703.0,Completely agree.
mentalhealth,fnehnca,t1_fne79q4,1586889536.0,The costs are so so high I completely agree. The moment you do break away you find yourself beating yourself up for even using that time to ever be near them as a result. It gets easier with time but you do have to fight yourself in the initial period afterwards for sure.
mentalhealth,fnehgxv,t1_fnecdmk,1586889444.0,"Tempting my dear, but remember, I found this out a few years back and I always regret even joining them in doing so. If you ever get in a fight do not fight with a chimney sweep. You will learn to regret it as I have. I wish you luck with whatever you want to do x"
mentalhealth,fnegx5a,t1_fnecst0,1586889165.0,"Hmm I’m lucky in that I had a few friends that I was close to before these bad seeds showed up. And that I got to make friends with a new bunch of people since them, even if we aren’t in close contact anymore in that I also found out through them how they were doing “friends” and relating was completely bad for me. I guess if you were to ask me I would suggest thinking of someone who you knew before them and always knew and felt you were at home with, and if they know the people you are having trouble with at the moment, to get some stuff off your chest and the most important thing of all is feel no obligation or that you are being deceitful in any way as you are doing so. You know that they were treating you poorly all along and you have finally woken up and wised up to it and you will no longer take instructions to stay around even if they did admit to it and that it is making you unhappy. If they know of your people that is a bonus but if not I would start to get your thoughts together with a professional. And try your luck with a new group of people, if you find the right people you will just know and it will click and you will feel so at ease knowing that there is another dynamic to be friends with people under. I wish you the best of luck with it :)"
mentalhealth,fnefbmb,t1_fne2n2d,1586888356.0,This is the way!
mentalhealth,fnef7ol,t1_fndud86,1586888299.0,Me too! It’s taken me a while also and therapy. But I’m so glad that I did. It’s like I finally have my thoughts back and my self back and my identity back. I’m really glad to read that you relate to my experience. I wish you the very best with it :)
ptsd,flw0umr,t3_frdd83,1585536782.0,It’s a lot easier for frustrations to come out as a result. I feel anger a lot more easier than most given my childhood and the people around me but I’m not a naturally angry person. And feel calm right now. My suggestion would be to literally shout and scream at the top of your lungs through a filter or something for now. Spill it all on the page what you would say to those who come to your mind. Kick a football/soccer ball or a basketball inside a drawstring bag indoors to get some of that weight and explosiveness off. And as for myself I like to get a feeling for how I am in the middle of the night when I’m a bit more relaxed as a result. But I’m a night guy and it may not work for everyone. Good luck with it all.
raisedbyborderlines,flvgoo0,t1_flv3l6e,1585523420.0,Seems that way. I mean I haven’t done anything to them so god knows what they must be feeling inside. And how they are to other people in the world that I don’t know about. If you get the name of the source please let me know

ptsd,fhedig5,t1_fhd950x,1581520014.0,My sleeping schedule is like that too. I come home sleep for about 3 hours then when I have a free day the next day I don’t fall asleep until 6 in the morning and wake up into the next day. Or if not I just get up and carry on as usual with just the 3 hours. It’s weird as well because I don’t feel drained when I know I should be.
ptsd,fhd21ey,t1_fhcztub,1581475627.0,That’s good to hear from here. I wonder sometimes too if I may have had complex ptsd before this because I would have dissociations too from when I was younger in my youth during days of school.
ptsd,fhd1tnv,t1_fhculf8,1581475500.0,I listen to the sound of rain falling. It seems to help for me. But sometimes it just doesn’t work. It gets too intense. I’m slightly more relaxed now but it took such an amount of time to be
ptsd,fhcs2ti,t1_fhcolyg,1581469632.0,Yeah maybe worth a check I feel. I’ve always had trouble sleeping too but it’s because I have an active mind. But this I know is different. It was never this way before for me

ptsd,fg1n50o,t1_fft06eh,1580430115.0,But I’m removed from the situation now. And am better at the moment. Which I feel glad about and proud of myself for. :)
ptsd,fg1n315,t1_fft06eh,1580430085.0,I let it wash over me rather than fight it and move onto something else to focus on. I just let it play through. And I know it is hurting me and killing and feels like I am trying my brain when I do. I need ice to have some sense of being able to sleep.

ptsd,f7dwzcz,t1_f7dvt1z,1573634262.0,How long have you had it for yourself? I’ve had it for three years now. Last two is when I realised I had it. (The first year it didn’t really show up because I could keep it at bay.)
abusiveparents,f76zn5c,t1_ezaqzu5,1573439976.0,Thank you so much for this btw. I wanted to say late than not at all.
abusiveparents,f76y4uo,t1_f73fd2i,1573438850.0,"Yes she will lend me money but I do ask for it. But I also say that I have other places I can get help from. Yet she still hands me it. Then after I cannot even raise any disputes that are completely unrelated over money yet she then flips it on me and forces me to feel grateful for her and shouldn’t I be ashamed of asking my mother for money WHEN SHE WAS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO GIVE IT TO ME. I feel trapped sometimes. Like I’ve been made to become a child but then I can’t even break free by raising my own thoughts and feelings and needs and wanting to assert that how she has been treating me completely unrelated to money matters, that she brings this up like some Damocles sword over my head. I feel infuriated as a result. Then she stonewalls me and pretends she never said any of those things- like you say gaslights me as if none of what she said was remembered. It is absolutely maddening and I actually feel the need to ask somebody else outside of the family circle to help me to communicate this to her because I think she plays by her own set of rules that herself created without anybody outside the four walls even aware of the dynamic that even goes on. It depresses me more than anything."
FamilyIssues,f5o49gp,t3_dohk2p,1572309688.0,Disgusting. So sorry you are going through all of this.
funny,f5hvd3t,t3_dnvor7,1572208307.0,Nice.
socialskills,f4p8rrw,t1_f4oqtj6,1571719744.0,Yeah that’s what it felt like. Thanks dude.
ptsd,f1aoynq,t1_f18riv4,1569300989.0,You have amazing insight as I read this it must be said. Thanks for sharing. I hope to get such close people one day too.
ptsd,f1758ea,t1_f16fc63,1569235930.0,"Same here. For me, I think I have a bit of narcissism, my therapist says it isn’t, and I know my parents do and is probably where I get it from, but it’s still in me and I cannot help but shift into this way and feel things like I feel better alone and free, I don’t need you, I don’t want to be tied to you, but then feel awful afterwards and do not know what washed over me. The trauma has made me feel and battle two different selves now and I feel like it makes me feel like it will get harder to get through as a result."
CPTSD,f12zamj,t3_d7o364,1569149689.0,Always remember. That for as long and whatever they say. It is not your fault.

iOS13,f12mq8o,t1_f12lt52,1569142980.0,Yeah move along. I am going to be using two fingers. Already am. You’ve actually helped me do so.
iOS13,f12lg8o,t1_f12kl6o,1569142381.0,I don’t know of anybody needing to use two fingers to scroll. Until sb else gives their input it looks like it’s just you. Obviously pinching and zooming requires two digits but undoing redoing only requires one uniform motion which can be achieved with the same fingers. It’s stupid ergonomics to use three digits and you obviously cannot answer to that so you can leave it. In the meantime I’m going to tap once to pop the menu up but I definitely will not be swiping. I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way.
iOS13,f0z37a3,t1_f0yrn2t,1569085258.0,Hi and thanks. It seems to have resolved itself now. But it was really really choppy and inconsistent earlier. Not sure if actually it needed time to bed in if that is at all a thing…
aww,f0xz8pw,t1_f0xroom,1569055135.0,And so is the girl.
iOS13,f0xy5by,t1_f0xizy3,1569053274.0,"I appreciate the answer. It seems to have gotten better somewhat on its own. Do you also know as well, if the keyboard dictionary/memory automatically resets itself upon a software update of this size, as a result?"

Seeing a conversation take place between two people. And having a guiding phrase to use to churn off myself and my own views and thoughts and feelings. And then maybe multiple choice responses. And zooming into their eyes and expressions as they do it.

Then for me it’d be along the lines of

Changing subjects
Not offending or disrupting their train of thought as you do so
Make them feel comfortable as you do it
Almost as if they never noticed
And have something they enjoy talking about
Not upsetting their ego etc.
A kind of guide in which to do it

Being raised in a direct abrupt household has made this somewhat harder for me.
Also
When you do so
your own point of view is held valid also

Spreading that feeling of warmth and validation

Just by a few words and expressions

But no imposing being done
No condescension being done

That kind of stuff really. I see those who went to an etiquette school or whatever they’re called transition a bit better than I do so I think it would be useful in general. It’s the more subtle bits that really get me. Especially when I’m in a crap mood and alarms are ringing when I’m around people to get away than hang around a bit longer if I only could keep this stuff going."
socialskills,f0b0d4u,t1_f0ar7kc,1568520997.0,"That would be interesting. I have no idea although I am surprised given there’s so much stuff on the internet nowadays, in the era of Masterclasses and the like."
ptsd,ezxo0qq,t3_d2uf9w,1568245241.0,"Me too. I felt this way too. I used to feel like it was all me and I was going crazy inside my own head. But I wasn’t. And I wasn’t all along. It just breaks my heart sometimes. Thinking about this. But now, I feel so much better now, so much better, for everything now. I am super grateful for this community also. We may not be able to see each other. But I know that we feel each other through our words. And the words we leave for each other. And that to me, means everything."
abusiveparents,ezmozpn,t1_ez6cq6x,1567995186.0,"I have to tell you, sometimes in the middle of the night like as I write this comment, I am filled with such intense heat and anger, I don’t know what to do with myself sometimes. It really gets to me. This isn’t the first thing she’s ever done to me. She denies things later when I bring them up. And makes it out as an affront to her. My mother feels like an impossible person to deal with at times. It eventually just makes me depressed sometimes."
