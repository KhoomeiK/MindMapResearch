CPTSD,fr3uehq,t3_gmdwpe,1589866550.0,"I wasn't allowed to socialize outside of school so I never had any lasting friendships. I just watched everyone else form friends and cliques and hear about all the things they did together on the weekends, during birthday parties, over the summer, etc. College I just kept my head in the books and didn't talk to anyone. As an adult all the close ""friendships"" I formed were all bonded over alcohol and I'm now sober and can't or don't want to associate with those people. The world is a lonely place. So you're definitely not alone. It's unfortunate but at least we can provide support for you here. It's not easy."

alcoholism,fr2cn4v,t3_gm2h1k,1589834992.0,"Thanks for posting this. Although I feel guilty that it makes me feel better except it's at your expense. :-/
I'm coming up on 90 days sober. At first it was easy, the weight started coming off (officially no longer overweight!). Now in the passed week or two I feel like a house got dropped on me, I feel stressed out when nothing has changed, I can't stop thinking about wanting to have a drink and then I find my way into the sweets cabinet. I've never been a stress eater and now here I am. Not wanting to trade one addiction for another I suddenly feel completely overwhelmed with anxiety, I can't breathe. 
I feel the same way about AA except I've never gone to a meeting. I feel like everyone else has a much worse story than mine and therefore I don't belong. I keep trying to tell myself that I do not in fact have a problem and that one day I can drink in moderation even though I know that's the biggest lie I've ever told. 
I haven't even told anyone that I'm sober except my boyfriend and one friend (and here). All my other friends are drunks. I can't figure out if I'm embarrassed or afraid to be alone. 

We can't go back to old ways though. I may not always know how to exactly push forward but I know I can't go back to being my old self. But again, thank you for sharing your story. It's good to know that I'm not the only one struggling. Like you said i feel like sometimes there's almost too much positivity here. And while that's all good I feel like it's unrealistic, at least for me. Some days I want to scream on a mountain that I'm just not doing ok. I really wish you the best. Stay strong my friend."
Baking,fqznh0m,t1_fqzmrn9,1589771098.0,That info was fine! I have a recipe with levain I formulated that works well for me that I do over 3 days with 3 single folds and my other method without levain I do 2 days and two double folds and I have drastically different results from each (honestly my sourdough version has a better crumb and more yeasty flavor rather than sour which is good). So I'm just always looking to see what others do so I can compare/experiment. Thank you very much!

KitchenConfidential,fqv7i33,t3_gl0b5j,1589671438.0,"The saying goes ""if you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen."" That being said, it is an extremely stressful industry. As commented above, do not supplement with drugs or alcohol but be aware that there is a solid chance you will be surrounded by it. Not always, but it is likely. Decide if that's an environment you want to be around. This doesn't mean you shouldn't pursue! Just be aware that the job is stressful on a daily basis. You will have time constraints and other limitations. You will not always have the help, time or equipment that you need. You will have to improvise. You will have to work under people you don't like. There are a lot of negatives and I'm not going to sugar coat it. You can't always do what you want, work when you want and be prepared to work many holidays, birthdays, special events, etc. Especially if you're very good at your job, be prepared to be someone who will be called upon often. 
But there are a lot of positives! You get to be creative, you get to make other people happy. If you have a good work ethic and like working then this is probably the job for you. There are lots of options available: restaurants, resorts, cruise ships, private, etc. You will be developing amazing skills that will be rewarding and can truly take you anywhere your heart desires. The biggest prerequisite is no fear of failure (because you will fail plenty, not every day will be successful), a willingness to learn & listen, and to take care of yourself mentally and physically. I can't stress that last part enough.

stopdrinkingfitness,fqqy4bq,t3_gjpkn4,1589574074.0,"I think the whole ""one day at a time"" bit has way more truth to it than you'd think. To me it always seemed silly until it finally clicked. If you focus on ""oh no...how will I get through the week how will I do it"" that stresses yourself out before the week even happened. Focus on today. Focus on tomorrow when it gets there. It adds so much unnecessary mental blocks. Today, what will you do today? So with that, see what pleases you when you drink and try to replace that with something else, like said above try an Arnold Palmer in a wine glass. Focus on your food more than beverage. It's is the mindlessness of drinking or is it the buzz? If it's the buzz I have to stimulate my brain another way (like working out). If it's the mindlessness I need a mindless activity. I knit and watch TV when I used to drink and watch TV."
stopdrinkingfitness,fqqx9wd,t1_fqmf41k,1589573629.0,Oh my God. If I had this piece of advice I probably would have stopped drinking a long time ago. I'd hate to see myself smashed. ü§ò

Baking,fqq8pfb,t1_fqplfi2,1589561304.0,Oooh the one for $108? That's more within my budget. I keep finding single molds for $30-40 and that's a bit steep for me but I don't want to be cheap about it because I understand the mold is important.

CPTSD,fqoumk7,t1_fqos5wh,1589525354.0,"With social media, I have to be honest I got rid of all my social media except Snapchat and I am new here. It was the best decision of my life. Having a hard time connecting with people social media just wasn't for me, and watching everyone else having seemingly better lives was just completely detrimental to my mental health. I figured it was better to try to interact with actual people than try online. It felt more genuine and helpful to myself. Social media was new when I was a teenager and I feel like the world interacted better without it. So my point is really not to take it too seriously if it's something that has bothered you before. I know it's popular but it's not everything or the be all end all."

pastry,fqnyax6,t1_fow2gpt,1589503813.0,It's definitely easier to use a European style butter with a high butterfat content 84% or higher. Using standard butter can be done but it cracks easily and is not very flexible at cooler temperatures
pastry,fqnx96r,t3_gi23zw,1589503213.0,"I've been using Plugra with success (finally) and here's how I managed my butter not to crack:

As posted above focus on the butter consistency to be the same as the detrempe consistency. If you want to get technical 60-65¬∞ F was a good temp for me to work with for the lock in and first turn, then anymore than 20 minutes in my refrigerator (which I believe runs a little cold) resulted in cracking butter. Work patiently. If you see signs of cracking let the paton rest on your counter for 5-10 minutes flipping it over every minute or so until the butter softens. 
I will make my butter block (without flour) the night before I laminate while my dough also rests. About an hour before I begin I take the butter out to rest at room temp which is typically 70¬∞ for me. I'll beat with a rolling pin after an hour, check consistency and then put back into th fridge if needed but only 5 minutes maybe if any melting started. It took many tries to realize you need the butter a hell of a lot warmer than you think! Warm enough to be pliable but cold enough to not leave greasy residue on your finger if you press into it. Hope this helps! It's frustrating I know!"
