Not a lot to say about this one. The show was okay, but I couldn't get attached to the characters in any meaningful way. I wanted to, but all except one were simply walking tropes. The action was occasionally interesting, yet I had so many questions about the panzers as a whole that it kept distracting me from enjoying it all that much. And the plot was all over the place. Even more all over the place was the comedy, which missed a lot more than it hit. On the whole, it was almost worth watching, but it won't be on my list of things to automatically recommend.

Right where the rapids are on the river is a zone change, and this will cause my game to crash if I've done a basic fuckup with my load order. I then check combat outdoors in the bandit camp with the first treasure map to see if it is balanced the way I like it. Then I head to Embershard Mine to check indoor combat, and yes it has changed on me between outdoor and indoor. This also lets me check normal treasure, level lists, and ore. Then I head to the treasure chest outside Riverwood that spawned after grabbing the map. Finally I head back into town and check the merchant service to make sure that is stable.

Only once all of that goes off without a hitch do I load my normal game and continue my playthrough. If it is stable for those steps, than it will stay stable for me throughout the world around 95% of the time.

Early 90s the cell phone was really only known by people who read tech magazines and the install for a car phone was so obscenely expensive that only the super rich had one. Mid 90s it started to percolate more into pop culture, as the cell phone was semi-portable enough that it was somewhat common in the middle management range of major corporations. By the late 90s, they were just getting to the miniaturization state where the Nokia bricks were close to being viable as a consumer product.

It also required the other tech to keep pace. Advancements in processors and batteries needed to come, and widespread installation of towers was necessary before it could move forward. Plus early cellphone models did not have a camera, much less connections to the internet. (This was also the era of AOL, which made internet connection expensive for the vast majority of users. Only the technologically minded knew that you could access the internet without paying fucking *hourly fees*.)
