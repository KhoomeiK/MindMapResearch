**Tayshia**: in BIP it seemed everyone was obsessed with her, second to Hannah G. So she could have *anyone she wants*. But she needs someone mature, maybe a bit older, and who lays it out like it is. She also needs this person to have a fun silly side which is what attracted her to JPJ so much. 

**Tia**: I haven’t watched her season yet, but the fact that I haven’t and still know exactly who she is shows she’s a like able, fun and not easily forgotten girl. I think she needs someone like Adam - Raven’s fiancé.

As short a story as I can provide is this. She lied about multiple things with Ben & D throughput the show and manipulated situations which came to light after the show ended. Even that was forgivable, but what she’s done post-show is disrespectful, cringey and embarrassing. She’s thirsty to be famous and it shows all over her social media. Constant ass pics, referring to herself as Assley. When in the show she came off as such an independent woman who found her strength, she’s shown the complete opposite and unfortunately her true colors, which are ugly.

If I click on the menu button it says I need to collect 1 skull and find 6 more mission intel but I have no clue where those are. 

I didn’t even know what the D button pad was so looked it up, when I click up it shows an arrow telling me to pick that weapon, which my teammates then do, and when I click down it does this weird cyber vision like a flow of rays in the direction I should go.
