relationship_advice,f8sq4kx,t3_e1zfx9,1574786617.0,"I have to ask...what's happened with the Church?  I am happy you have faith, but it seems like everyone in your church is circling the wagons around you to make sure you live within the boundaries they deem acceptable.  Are you ok understanding you may need to find a new church after this? 

Also, sorry to be a jerk, but it sounds like you AND your ex are not prioritizing these kids.  You seem to be obsessed with guilt and she's obsessed with surrounding you with chaos and people who will force you back into the home..."

EltonJohn,f6yxii9,t3_dts2r9,1573302711.0,"I was there! He was fantastic...our section was NOT. No one stood up, no one seemed to be actually enjoying the show. We stood up for Philadelphia freedom (we are from dc) because we thought the crowd would be excited...we got yelled at by a few people in our section. We ended up leaving and befriending the security folks who let us stand in one of the tunnels to watch, which ended up being great. I was sort of sad the energy up on the top level was very...very...very...mellow. Elton, however, was absolutely spectacular. A true legend."
