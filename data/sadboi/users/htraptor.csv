I get it. Normalcy bias is a thing and it's very strong. It's just so upsetting. I truly care about my boyfriend and his family, and especially my own. I understand the virus mainly affects those with health issues and old age, but there's still reason to worry.

I'm not sure what changed, but the 7th year of our friendship, I became INSANELY annoyed with everything she did. The way she talked, what she liked, what she complained about, etc. I felt so guilty for feeling this way and ignored it for several months. 

Eventually, it caught up to me and I think it showed I was annoyed because she stopped approaching me and I stopped trying with her. I still feel guilty to this day, I just had no idea how to say, ""Hey, love you, but you're kind of annoying and I don't want to hang out and be friends anymore?""

I lost my best friend, but I think it taught me a valuable lesson. For many years, I liked something that I didn't really enjoy just because she liked it and it was what we had in common. Eventually, I stopped pretending and that's when the falling out happened.

My mother is incredibly self conscious of her appearance. She is always paranoid her husband is doing something horrible. She is constantly checking to see if he leaves at night. 

Every cheater is different. Some change and some don't. 

I can tell you from the seeing how victims of cheating turn out aren't pretty. The person you're in love with and would never cheat on has cheat on you, possibly more than he said, and has the potential to continue to later on in your life. 

No, I don't think you ever recover from an affair. The victims never heal, and the cheaters want to move on. But you never will be able to.

Because of all this love, the only things that keep me going are my partner and my little brother. I'm incredibly in love with my boyfriend. I love him so much that I want to live so I can be with him longer. So we can move in together, get married, start a family, and grow old together. 

I love my little brother. My depression has been life long, and when I started high school, I considered ending my life. And then I found out my mom was pregnant. My little brother is the smartest child I've ever met, and while he has so much attitude and sass, I love him dearly and he loves me. 

There's little things in life that can be hard to see and appreciate (things I'm trying to be better at to appreciate) and the big things that mean the most. 

There's a quote I live by, from a recent TV show. 

""I loved you completely, and you loved me the same. That's it. The rest is confetti."" 

To me, love matters most. This world is twisted and dark and will only get worse. Our problems in life will always be there, and new ones will come, and bad things will happen.

Sure, you could go skydiving, you could travel the country, you could try exotic foods, you can do many out-of-this-world things that's definitely worth trying before leaving. 

But what about bigger picture goals?

Falling in love? Starting a family? Watching your kids fall in love? Helping your kids with heartbreak, getting through tough times, watching them get married? Having grandkids? Growing old? 

Think of all the amazing foods that will come out after you leave. The music. The movies. The cars. 

Yes, this world sucks. Even with all these great things, there will always be terrible things. For people with depression, those terrible things are amplified and either come in waves or are constantly there. 

But. 

We could not appreciate the beauty in life without seeing the ugly. We could not feel the love and happiness or life without the pain. 

And people with depression? I think we have a gift. 

We are not normal. We see things from a different perspective. We can be emotional or numb. We can be lost or finally finding our way. We are all many things, but we aren't normal. 

Thank God for that. 

What I'm saying is - don't end it. I know being told that might irritate you, and you might argue that you plan to do it anyway, but I'm going to persist and say don't do it.

Basically, yes it does suck to not be like everyone else. Having friends, being successful, having no life problems, and just sliding through life. That's not practical for those with depression, though. 

Your life does have value and meaning - just because you feel left out and alone doesn't mean there should be any doubt about what you're doing in life.

SuicideWatch,fiy1arh,t3_fadl4g,1582830522.0,"I recommend going to speak with your campus counselor.

My first exam in college, I struggled with my depression terribly. I guessed every answer and just cried silently the entire time. 

I recently spoke with my counselor (leaving out the suicidal part to avoid any legal issues) and they've helped me with disability services as well. This provides extra time during exams, taking exams/turning in homework at a later date (with communication with the teacher), and etc. 

Your campus can help you more than you realize. Please seek their help before it's too late!  

On a side note, I'm very sorry this happened to you. I understand. People with depression who are working to achieve things like a degree or job have it ten times worse than the average person - every task is like being asked to move a mountain. It's so damn hard and no one realizes it.

But please don't end it.

You'd never see your kids graduate. Never see your kids fall in love. Never be there for them when they go through their first heartbreak. Never see them get married. Never see your grandkids. Never grow old and possibly fall in love again. Or even just have the ability to grow old and love your life and appreciated the fact you stayed to see everything beautiful. 

Don't leave those kids with that terrible man. They need you. 

I'm so sorry for what your husband has put you through. You are so much more than him. You were a human being before him, with him, and you can be after him. Your story with him ending shouldn't signify that your story ends completely too.

I've always considered myself to be a selfless person, because I always put others feelings and needs before my own. I never asked for help with my depression because I thought that would be selfish. I chose an easy education/career I didn't want to pursue instead of taking the time to consider what I really wanted to do. I never took the time to explore my hobbies or interests. 

This year, I have accomplished so many things. I figured out the career I want, even though it's a very odd one (a mortician). I got my first tattoo. I started a business where I make beautiful crafted jewelry. I told my mom about my depression. I'm going to therapy.

depression,fgnwy09,t1_fgnsiwy,1580954700.0,"I normally take it one day at a time also, but I'm trying to get on medication soon. I feel it would be beneficial and make it at least easier to get through everyday. And I hear you. It feels like nothing can fill that void, and it'll be there until we die. It would be fine if it was there and we didn't know it, but we feel it everyday. Deeply and intensely. It's so hard."

My counselor confirmed I had depression, and after talking out how nothing traumatic has happened, it's highly likely it's genetic. 

And he is a good person. He doesn't deserve what I put him through. I'm sorry they left you - that's shit."
jewelry,fg529vj,t3_eo6w1b,1580516517.0,"I recently told my mother about my struggle with life-long depression. We've been closer than we ever have before, and we have decided to create our own jewelry-making business.

It gives us time together, makes us happy to make crafts and beautiful jewelry, and we have worked hard to make sure our customers will be happy.

My mother and I have created the company HK Moments, and we make resin necklaces and put genuine flowers in our products. We recently just opened our store on our own website and soon Etsy. We are planning to create more jewelry and other resin items like unique and beautiful paperweights, bowls, jewelry dishes, and more.

It would mean a lot to us if you reached out. This isn't about the money for us; it's the moments (hence HK Moments) we create and we want to make our customers very happy. 

Please check us out! We will make sure you are happy with your order, and we will soon make more products and take custom orders!

I'm aware enough to know what I saw wasn't okay and it would make anyone upset. I just feel like when everything happened, I feel that I should have put my emotions aside to ensure the local PD could get a license plate and possibly track the guy down."

AskReddit,fek2lkb,t3_epeqn1,1579191278.0,"My boyfriend and I drove to his eye appointment one morning. He was just getting his glasses' frame fixed, so we agreed I would sit in the car while he did what he needed to do inside. 

It took a little longer than we expected, but it was no problem for me. Besides, I was in my pajamas in his car due to our previous agreement that I would stay in the car.  I just played on my phone while I waited for him to finish. 

At one point while I was waiting, I got a really bad feeling. I was just on Twitter looking at news, when I got a really bad feeling. Like, a pit in my stomach. One where I was almost afraid to look up. I did anyway. I didn't see anything when I looked out the front window, but when I glanced to the side, I noticed the truck besides me. 

A man was staring at me. He looked very unkept and wild; almost homeless-looking. But he had a truck and decent clothes on, so I assumed he just didn't groom himself well. When we met eye contact, he didn't look away. 

And then I noticed there was movement several inches away from his face. He was staring at me and jerking off. I could see everything he was doing, he saw that I was aware, and he didn't stop. 

I was horrified. I was too scared to call the police. He was just inches away from me, my boyfriend's passenger car door didn't lock, and I was scared what he would do when he realized I was calling someone. I texted my boyfriend, saying I can't call but someone is masturbating and staring at me in the truck besides me, asking him to come out and get his license plate, and maybe just help me at all. I didn't want to risk calling anyone. His reactions could be to ignore it, speed away, or to stop me, and I didn't want to gamble. 

I felt hopeless. If this man wanted to get in this car, he could without any resistance (besides my own, of course). It was repulsive and terrifying. I avoided his gaze, but I could feel he was still staring at me. I tried to sink low into the seat, but his truck had a lift kit and was taller than our car. 

He finished and he stared at me for another few seconds and then he sped out of the parking lot. I was crying too hard to see the license plate. My boyfriend didn't see his messages because he was talking with his eye doctor. 

While I know the vile man didn't hurt me at all, it chilled me to my core what he did and what he could have done. I feel so much guilt and regret for not getting the truck's license plate. I feel so much regret for not calling the police anyway. 

I could see his genitalia, and though he didn't touch me, I still remember memories of that scenario I don't want to remember. When I'm with my partner having intimate moments, my mind sometimes flashes to that memory. 

His truck had a lift kit. The fact that I could see his genitalia in plain view, with his truck being feet taller than my boyfriend's car, tells me that he shifted his seat up to where I could see. He wanted me to see. 

It makes me feel disgusting. It makes me want to blame myself for what happened; maybe I was wearing something suggestive, maybe I was sitting in a suggestive position, etc. 

When he left the parking lot, I remember just sitting in my seat. I couldn't move, I was so afraid and disgusted. I just sat there silently, crying. When my boyfriend rushed out, then I started crying really hard. 

I feel guilty for even being upset about it. Nothing happened to me, and far worse has happened to others. But I felt no safety at that moment. I felt disgusting, used, and terrified to make any move to stop the situation that happened. It chills me to wonder what he was thinking when he stared at me. What he imagined he was doing; what he imagined he was doing to me. 

We told the eye doctor (who is a family friend) about my situation and asked if there were any cameras on the building, to which she told us none of the buildings in her area did. So, the only chance of us ever catching the guy laid in my hands. And I blew it by being too afraid and crying too hard to see the license plate."
AskWomen,fegzqzm,t3_eoy958,1579106121.0,"I'd been friends with him for years in school, and I always thought he was so cute and funny. 

One day, when we were driving out of the school parking lot, I saw him and got a surge of confidence and followed him on Twitter. (It may not seem like a lot, but I wouldn't follow people I had a crush on out of fear.)

He followed me back, and then he messaged me and we hit it off from there. We had an instant connection and we've been together for over 3 years. I'm glad I followed him, because he told me he was as shy as I was and also had a crush on me for years."
AskReddit,fdlos21,t3_eluch8,1578528908.0,"I had an unknown teratoma growing on my right ovary. It apparently had been there since I was born, but no one discovered it. 

One day, I was laying down when I began to feel intense cramping. I assumed this was a period, so I let it go on for several minutes. At one point, it felt as if someone had kicked my stomach from the inside and I jerked in pain from it. I realized that this was not menstrual cramping, and something was wrong. Eventually, I was gasping and yelling in pain when the ambulance arrived. 

During the half hour drive to the closest hospital, it only got worse. I was vomiting, pissed myself, rolling from side to side, unable to sit still, and yelling. I wanted to die from how badly it hurt. It felt like someone was stabbing me from the inside of my body. 

My ovary was twisting from the huge teratoma that had been growing, cutting off all blood flow. The teratoma was benign (noncancerous), but because of the intense pain that could happen again and possibility of it spreading in places it shouldn't, I had to have my entire right ovary and Fallopian tube removed. The teratoma was the side of a baseball."
