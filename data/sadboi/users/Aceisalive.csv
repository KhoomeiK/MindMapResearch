hamstercare,fr2d5ki,t3_gm2j7u,1589835242.0,I admittedly can’t fully tell from the photo but what size wheel do you have? It looks like it may be too small for a Syrian. If Syrians don’t have a proper wheel they can begin to scratch and tear at their own skin out of stress and boredom.

When you come out as trans to someone you are taking every thought they have about trans people head on. People will probably not know what to think, or have a bad initial reaction. Give your friends and family time. It could be weeks or months but some of those people who had a hard time with it at first will probably come around. Acceptable takes time so don’t expect it immediately."

Yes, just like anything you can repress being trans TEMPORARILY. I get it, you have a life outside of your gender identity and don’t need beings trans to interrupt that at this current moment. The best way I’ve found is to treat it like an addiction in terms of repressing it. I am trans myself and don’t think it’s a bad thing, those are just the skills that work for me. I try to distract myself, avoid temptation, pick up a go to hobby to dig yourself into besides thinking about it. Again I am not advocating for you to repress your trans identity, I am simply answering your question."

Edit: Found!
Amazon had them marked up by about 25%

No. By definition normal is “conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected.” and I think most people would agree that, that is not conforming to the standard.

There is nothing wrong with dressing like that, but no it is not the standard normal."
PetMice,fmg10av,t1_fmfci4m,1586039015.0,I was just about to comment this. A good rule of thumb with small animals is that they should be able to run on it without there spine curving. With mice it’s a bit more difficult because you also need to give them enough room that their tail isn’t forced to stand straight up in the air like that. I would a 8 or 10 inch wheel.
AmItheAsshole,fmg0grq,t3_fuw3ia,1586038697.0,No judgement here but honestly you could probably go to any grocery stores and get some eyebrow gel stuff and a spooly blush. With a little practice she can just draw them back on. A ton of tutorials on YouTube too.

hamstercare,fm8bz99,t3_ftjl7g,1585846608.0,">buying hamsters from pet stores 

Um, I don’t think this counts as abuse. I don’t support the buying of hamsters from pet stores, but how is that abuse? It may be considered supporting unethical practices which I don’t agree with but I don’t think your abusing an animal because you bought it from a pet store. Also not every pet store is bad. Chains like Petco, and Petsmart are typically unethical, but there are a lot of small and local pet stores that treat the animals right and buying from them is certainly not abuse."
