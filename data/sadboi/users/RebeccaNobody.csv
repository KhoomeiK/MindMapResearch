asktransgender,fje6k4t,t1_fje5mtg,1583266206.0,">So, if your mood changed when your meds did, I'd look there first, especially if the depression generally worsened anyway- I'd imagine changing the hormones around after that would absolutely make you feel different, especially if you had other stresses related to your transition (like if you were at that time trying to schedule surgery, and not getting anywhere).  

I stopped HRT and started Abilify at the same time. 

>When you say you're feeling ""much better"", is it just about the dysphoria or are you generally less depressed?  

Both!

>If you think about the last 5 years and the 5 years before that, if your transition could basically ""freeze"" instead of having T take over again would that be your choice or are you feeling like you want to let things change back?  Basically, does it feel like it's about whatever effect the meds + hormones seem to have had, or your actual appearance even now when you're feeling better?   

Changing back would make living as a man easier. Although judging by how often I'm called sir I'd say I'm pretty masculine as-is. I really don't care about my body anymore. I have no opinion. I'm just glad the voice in my head saying ""This isn't right! You're not a woman! You're a fraud!"" has stopped.

>If you feel like ""staying as you are now"" beats going back to before you started transitioning, I'd let your psych know you want to keep trying other options (did you ask them about this, or just your HRT person?), because if there's a regimen out there that \*doesn't\* do weird things when you're on hormones and still helps the depression a bunch, that sounds like the probable best result for you (from my outsider's armchair, of course).

I truly don't know. It really doesn't matter that much either way.   

> How do you get confidence? Do you have any pleasures or great prides of life?    

No. I don't believe in pride. ""Pride goes before a fall."" I believe if I stay down then the Universe will be less likely to punish me.  

>Things that make you very happy? Any goals you are working on?  

I **was** working on getting bottom surgery, but now I don't know. I guess my goal every day is just to make it to the next day. That's already really hard.   
 

> If you wear flats, get some heels that are over 4 inches. (Comfortable ones) They boosted my confidence a lot! I recommend Venus.com for many clothing.    

FWIW, I usually wear flats (or sneakers) since I'm on my feet a lot at work, but I do sometimes wear heels. I'm wearing knee-high boots with like a 2.5"" heel right now. That being said I'm already 6' (183cm) tall. Heels make me more obvious.

> If you dislike your wardrobe, update it. But these are things you have to identify and execute on your own.   

I quite like my wardrobe. I never said I didn't. I don't know where this emphasis on clothes came from. I often shop at Torrid.   

>Were your confident before you transitioned?   

No. Even less so, if you can believe it."
