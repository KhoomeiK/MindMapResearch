AmItheAsshole,fjkg762,t1_fjke651,1583426261.0,"YES. It gets crazy expensive with the vet. Lucky I have insurance on my cat and a family that helps. And no animal deserves to be assumed to need less care in any way. The thought of her getting a cat instead genuinely scares me. Or any animal Ofc.
Animals are expensive and requires a lot of care."
love,fjke99u,t3_fdu7ho,1583425340.0,"I'm sorry you have to go through the judgements and that your mom makes you feel anything but happy about it, I'm lucky I haven't been through it. My bf is 3 years younger, we're 24 and 21. And I have yet to hear any negative about it, people around me tend to not really react on it.
It will most likely get easier with age. The older you are the easier you get away with age gaps no matter who's the oldest. I know a couple that got together in their 20's. She's 4 years older than him. They got a kid together, but didn't work out bc they were too different as people. The guy met a new girl in his 40's that's 10 years younger. 
There's no rules, just be with someone that makes you happy. Wishing you all the luck and happiness with your bf!"

Then I got IUD (hormonal) and maybe I bled some in the beginning, don't really remember how much or how long, but now I haven't bled for months. Maybe even over a year. But works differently for different people and gotta give it a few months. IUD really worked wonders for me tho. Would recommend a try."

whatifyou,fiynugs,t1_fiyfyxa,1582843105.0,Same. But would prob land softly as I'd be on the bed. Unless I fall all the way to the floor.
AskReddit,fix149k,t3_fa00m2,1582809910.0,"Easy (okay it wasn't easy I spent time figuring this out but still). And it also depends really, would I have to pay to have it exchanged to my country's value, would my current economy be affected and whatever risks are for randomly receiveing such great deal of money? You know, realistically.

At least if not (prob either way), I'd take $100,000 tmrw, cause as some said you never know how it'll be in 10 years or if you're even alive. And as someone in a poorer situation it'd most likely be better to take it now. Especially if it doesn't affect my current economy. 

If it isn't affected, I'd start by paying off debt and take my bf to galaxy's edge and let him go crazy. Let us both go crazy.

  Then Ofc spend it on some other needed /wanted things and save."
