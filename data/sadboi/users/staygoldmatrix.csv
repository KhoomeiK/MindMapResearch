SexWorkers,et4ffb5,t3_c9ykcu,1562449266.0,"You have to understand that we get constant cancellations and they always have some bullshit ass excuse. Sorry but your dog having cancer seems like the most played out one in the book. If you paid a cancellation fee, you should be fine though. 

Personally I blacklist every guy that cancels lately. Never waste a hoes time"

SuicideWatch,esda96k,t3_c73v8z,1561851528.0,"I shot myself in the chest a few years ago. Something like a 100k hospital bill. Was in there for a while due to complications and then later necessary surgery. 

I haven’t paid a dime. Naturally my insurance won’t cover any of it due to it being self inflicted or whatever.

And I will continue to not pay a dime. Just me"

AskReddit,es99j6o,t3_c6cq6r,1561730914.0,"Not sure if this goes under this forum or not. 

But a guy and some buddies went to a 5 star restaurant under their hotel. One of his friends was extremely rich but wore shabby clothes so you’d never guess. As they were trying to get a table, the waiter tells the rich guy that he cannot give them a table with the outfit he had chosen. Apparently he looked slightly homeless. 

Rich guy goes upstairs to his hotel room, changes into a tux, then puts all his money in his large suitcase. I mean fills it to the brim. 

Comes back downstairs and the waiter gives them a table. Rich guy plops his large suitcase in the middle of the dinner table. Waiter explains that he cannot put his luggage on the table, to which the rich guy replies, 

“This is my wallet.” As he opens his luggage to reveal hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

The waiter’s face flushed red and he quickly walked off. The literal manager ended up waiting their table for the rest of the night."

Trust me, it ran through my mind. At one point I actually kept changing where I had the barrel pointed. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. Head. Heart. 

Last minute, I decided I didn’t want to paint that picture. I didn’t want my mother to have to identity my brains. 

Turns out it worked out for the best. I have severe nerve damage and chronic pain now and my ribs grew back incorrectly but hey, I have a completely different perspective on life. Took something that dramatic unfortunately which is why I only hope I can prevent those in my same predicament to just keep fighting, even if you only take it one day at a time."

SuicideWatch,erxghgs,t1_erxfsro,1561384095.0,"Don’t be sorry. You don’t have to keep apologizing. Just toughen the fuck up. My niece has seizures about 3x a day and she can barely walk on her own anymore but shes smiling all the time and is hopeful for the treatments and does this thing called love life even though all of the odds are against her. You have to take life for the good and the bad and make your OWN destiny out of it. 

I shot myself in the chest almost 3 years ago now. So trust me I know how you’re feeling. & if it’s not your time to go, you will survive. Bullet broke 2 of my ribs, went through my lung, lung collapsed and then exited through my back. But I survived feeling a whole lot more stupid than before. I was in so much damn pain and when I got transferred to the psych ward after being medically released (was healing for months), I met a girl in there in a wheelchair. Of course everyone was asking her why she was paralyzed from the waist down and you wanna know why? Because she shot herself in the chest as well years back but she wasn’t as lucky as I was. The bullet got lodged in her spine and she survived but is now paralyzed from the waist down.

I walked away with some broken ribs, collapsed lung and some pretty gnarly scars. 

Someone always has it worse. Maybe when you start to feel like this way again, you can use this energy towards helping others just like you. Make a difference. Be the change. Don’t just lay there and be depressed and think about suicide. You are beautiful. You are loved. You’re going to ace school if you choose to. Maybe school isn’t your thing, and if that’s the case screw what your parents think. Be free. One love <3"
SuicideWatch,erxehhh,t3_c4la63,1561382494.0,Yeah really take some perspective in. You have it good. Others have it wayyyy worse. I wish I had people that gave a fuck too. Smh you have it good how can you not see that
