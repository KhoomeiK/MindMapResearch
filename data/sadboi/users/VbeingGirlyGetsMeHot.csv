PublicFreakout,fpok1lm,t1_fpmqytb,1588785809.0,"> My point about use of violence is based on the view that it is only okay to kill when during a battle and it is to save another or yourself from an aggressor. In this case the battle is the heat of the moment where one wrong move by the girl gets her killed. The aggressors are the cops. So to save the innocents life the cops need to be immediately delt with in some fashion. This isn't to say have a gun battle in the street, that makes things worse. In the heat of the moment, one armed citizen (I know this is canada) quietly walks up to the cop (in this case more difficult because there are multiple) and pops it in the head. No more danger to the innocent being assaulted and potential killed. It's not about hatred for the cop or doing something out of anger, rather about saving an innocent which is always right. We should all side with the innocent, not stay silent out of our fear when we witness these events. I don't want anyone to die but in this case I don't want the girl in the costume to not die more."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fp1f0bm,t1_fozyzxr,1588233312.0,"If you were going to intervene in any way it would likely result in your death either by execution or cop. By punching the cop you get death by cop. By attempting to take the cops gun and kill it you get death by execution if you succed in stopping the cop terror. Or life in prison depending on the state. However, if you are in a death penalty state and are going to intervene, you may as well kill the cop because you'll die no matter how you intervene."
