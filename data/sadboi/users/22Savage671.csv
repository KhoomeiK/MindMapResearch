Far less accurate? Wtf? Flatline got one of the best hipfire accuracies and easiest recoil patterns. Slap an hcog on that bitch and it's free kills. R301 is the type of gun where you land all your shots and still lose cause the other guy got a 99, flat, or havoc. The hipfire accuracy is still the most important part imo, because ARs have shit strafe speed so hipfiring allows you to better control your strafe and add jumps and crouches much smoother.
