Anyone have tips for me? I've tried to make two tarantula islands and all I ever get after an hour is one tarantula. (Of course it bites me.)

Here's what I do:

Go after 7PM

pull all weeds & flowers

remove all trees

break all rocks

Dig holes along river edges to thwart giant water bugs

scare away tiger beetles and wharf rats

Run around holding my net

WHAT AM I MISSING?"
Anxiety,eypr6a9,t3_cw8ahf,1567308543.0,"Yes. I handle this anxiety in two ways 1) I do things right away so I can’t dwell on them. 2) I reduce how much stuff I can even see by deciding categories of chaff and wheat and I put the chaff someplace I just can’t see it easily. For example only the most important stuff can get into my primary tab in gmail. I use the Social tab as a place which I check only a few times a day and Promotions- I never look at. 

Basically I limit what I can feel responsible for. I still need to do things right away, but I set it up to have less things. Luckily I am a quick decision maker, so I can decide a rule about chaff vs wheat pretty easily.  Maybe doing this will help you.

My son has this issue and he handles it by avoidance as well. I think it’s two sides to the same coin."
TMJ,eyplzoy,t1_eymu5kd,1567304027.0,"Hey. I hope you get better soon. Flare ups really, really suck, but they do end and I hope yours does soon."
TMJ,eypli83,t3_cy04k7,1567303617.0,"I agree it sounds TMJ related. The only OTC pain med that does anything for the pain for me is naproxen (Aleve.) My primary care doc had me on 500 mg every 12 hours and it at least took the edge off. I also take 5 mg of cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxant) every night before bed to try to keep myself from tensing my jaw while I sleep. I’ve had a night guard for years but during a flare up it’s not quite enough. One last thing is that 20 minutes in a hot shower will stop the pain for hours if I catch it early in the day. By 4PM it’s too late. 

I also got an appliance and an exercise from a dentist who specializes in TMD during my last flare. I’ve only had two, but this last one was epic. She believed I had sprained a specific muscle and the appliance sits on my back molar and lets me stretch that muscle. She molded it there in the office - kinda like a short section of a mouth guard that fits on top of my back lower molar.
 
I visited my primary care doc and got meds and my dentist who sent me to the TMJ dentist. I’d recommend you find one, but make sure they’re reputable and don’t try to do all kinds of crazy stuff to you like splints and surgery. Good luck!"

TMJ,eva15t4,t1_ev8dllm,1564336249.0,Thanks so much for your advice. Ya get kind of desperate.
timeteam,euyhied,t3_btwsu7,1564102512.0,I thought only one season was on Prime. Oops just read on a bit and saw I am wrong.
TMJ,euy5pt9,t3_cf0lcs,1564095902.0,The only thing that barely works for TMD pain is naproxen (Aleve.)
