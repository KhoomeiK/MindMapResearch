but I 100% understand the ease up thing, and thats why I started drinking. (And wow this is a dangerous topic for this subreddit) im my head its a cure all but obviously thats not the best idea lol. (I did use whiskey as a prize for myself for taking my meds) it lead me down a very steep slope last year and I was very nearly put in rehab, and thats the main reason i am concerned.

teentitans,fit67sa,t3_f9mim1,1582706299.0,"I think that the two of them are kinda perfect for eachother. The ship gets backlash from BBRAE shippers, but I that pair makes no sense.

Both Raven and Damien have this struggle between what is right and what is preordained by their father/grandfather. They both have decided on the good path but struggle still with their sense of self and with their urge toward the morose nature of their paternal expectations.

I feel that both characters are also severely emotionally stunted and too mature for their age. Neither were in a position growing up where emotion helped them, they were taught to bottle it up, Raven especially because its dangerous otherwise. A typical affectionate relationship wouldn‚Äôt work for each of their characters, and so I think that the each of them really could be the best thing for the the other. 

The two of them just make far too much sense to me. Feel different if you must, but I think I have solid reasoning.  Also feel free to add on, I feel like im missing a point of my whole rationale but cant think of it ATM."
