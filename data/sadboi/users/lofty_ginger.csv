badwomensanatomy,fqtx5i6,t1_fqtk0w3,1589647820.0,"I know body dysmorphia is a bitch, but I hope it helps to know that some ladies (like me) actually pray for smaller dicks on partners because I have a low-set cervix, so sex with even an average-length penis can be really painful. But either way, a penis is a penis and I'm happy with whatever."

TrollXChromosomes,fkpyxuc,t1_fkpnt31,1584423921.0,"Thank you so much!! Honestly, there is still a mental barrier to get over every time, but the barrier gets a little shorter every time. So definitely still a challenge, but not daunting or impossible by any means."
TrollXChromosomes,fkpn27b,t1_fkp0zke,1584414084.0,"I know exactly what you mean, and it was the same exact story for me before I met my current guy. Sex was always great but I never came ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ He was the first of any guy ever to make me reach orgasm, and it took AGES. But he was consistent and I bent my brain in half to get over the mental block and BOOM. Not sure any other guy would have the persistence to make it happen, so I’m crazy crazy lucky."

gifs,fhq7m86,t3_f4b2rm,1581800406.0,"Unfortunately, this is a huge problem for male EMT's, male nurses, and nursing home employees/caregivers. A lot of old women are only given a slap on the wrist because no one wants to confront someone's sweet little granny. I'm all about trying to keep feeling young and fun... but sexually harassing people isn't how you do it. I'm not saying we should toss her overboard, but she should be held accountable for such inappropriate actions."

Another one and I have become pen pals for several years and he gave me grocery money a couple times when I moved far away from home and was borderline homeless for a while. Thank you, Doug :-)"

When I worked at an assisted living facility, we had a resident with a VERY STRICT night time routine that was always topped off with a Werther’s Original before we left the room for the night.

 Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome [http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30) 

&#x200B;

It is a relatively new diagnosis, and it is primarily neurological with a plethora of physiological complications and symptoms, which makes it hard to diagnose unless you're well-versed. It would often make me pass out, made me have a strange/irregular heartbeat, dizziness upon standing, heat intolerance, and much more. Some of the main medications used to treat it are beta blockers."
