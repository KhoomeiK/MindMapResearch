My mom was saying when Adele was heavy people called her a lot of mean names because she was heavy, like internet trolls did, and then now they are calling her names because she's thin.  Fat, thin, whatever people are calling her names.  Her point i guess what that when you're in the public eye some people are gonna be jerks about it and there's not much you can do."
