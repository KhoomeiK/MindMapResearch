The entirety of it is based on expectations from each other which if the other breaks can wreak hell on the other. It is that letting go and being in the position of vulnerability that makes romantic love romantic.

It's not just this one act, another little mistake that she did, no.

Rest is to be left upon time until B is ready to forgive. To come to forgiveness, both the parties have to do their part where A's part is major. And when A gets frustrated and annoyed because of the slow recovery from B's side, what it clearly shows is that she does not feel remorseful for her actions and more than that, does not understand the pain she put B through. In other words, A knows she fucked up but she doesn't **feel** it and until that happens, B's recovery cannot even start."

Edit: I recall this from my early childhood so my memory is not to be completely relied upon.

&#x200B;

I was 7 at the time, and coincidentally that very morning I had asked my parents (dad being a geologist) what an earthquake was because I had heard the term recently. I was explained and was told what to do in case one ever occurs. It was Republic Day here so all of us were getting ready to go watch the parade. And suddenly, everything started shaking violently. Mum's dresser door opened and nailpolish and other things started falling down and shattering. Memory being very fresh, I instantly knew what was happening and mum asked me and my sister to rush out. My sister started going upstairs as my dad was there shouting ""Daddy, Daddy"". Mum asked sister very strictly to get back down and said ""Dad will come"" and in what must have been like a total of at least 30 seconds, we were out of the house and out of the main gate onto the street. All my neighbours were out there on the street too. And even while standing there, the intense shaking must have went on for maybe 20-30 seconds or more. Everyone just got out portable beds and slept on the street for a few days because of the risk of aftershocks. My house walls had big visible cracks at many places, nothing more. Some other houses fell (including my tuition teacher's, which I was happy about as a kid).

&#x200B;

The epicenter was near a city and the structures were not quake-proof. It flattened it out. Death toll was in thousands. It was a pretty intense quake, several buildings as far as 350km in far-away cities fell down. It's depth was just 16km compared to the 110km in Peru right now (which explains the X scale)."

But then when proper research would be done on those subjects, we might find the reasons for why the person is able to do so. And then we will find out the laws governing it i.e. the limits and constraints of that power. The scientific laws we live by will shift to accommodate the new findings. And thus, magic will become science.

It's like magic is all around us. Science is just the language we have created to better understand what that magic can do and how it can be pushed to further limits. Never thought I'd use this quote by Albert Einstein but I'm suddenly reminded of it!
