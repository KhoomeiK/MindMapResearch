BPD,fjesl6p,t3_fcrfpo,1583277464.0,"I'm so glad I saw this. 

Anytime I'd bring up an issue to my long term ex and bare in mind I would BLATANTLY say to him 'I'm not saying this to hurt you or be mean but you hurt my feelings by...' he would flip it around and make out I was making him feel like a d*ck and that I was making HIM out to be the bad one and I was hurting his feelings, even though most situations looking back I wasn't in the wrong and just wanted acknowledgement and he just never accepted responsibility and passed it onto me, and because I didn't feel like he'd acknowledged what I said it'd be my BPD because he can't do anymore than what he has or it would be my BPD and that my feelings were just exaggerated and that I was in the wrong for that, I told him how I always felt like I loved him more than he did me just due to how we were with each other etc and he literally said 'well you have BPD so you would feel like that' and said in lesser words that he couldn't of ever loved me that much cuz he doesn't have BPD. Eventually I would just stop saying how I felt and the relationship fell apart (due to other reasons too) and he broke up with me for the 2nd time.

This was nearly two years ago however and I've never been happier single but I still get nervous whenever I have to say how I feel, I have a pretty strong gut instinct but won't listen to it 98% of the time because it's just me being crazy or paranoid, and whenever I'm in a confrontation I have to ask people (afterwards) if I'm being a d*ck or said something too mean and if I'm in the wrong JUST FOR EXPRESSING  FEELINGS. I do my best to be as supportive and objective and act as kind and decent as I can (Doctor Who y'all, hella inspired me) and yet saying 'you hurt my feelings because...' CRIPPLES me with anxiety.

Idk if that makes a whole lotta sense but it feels good to get it off my chest in a subreddit that'll understand. 

(I would like to say I have reacted badly in situations similar in the past, screaming at people to understand me and extreme anger, and due to those I have learnt to grow and accept them as part of me and gone forward by learning from those bad situations and bad choices to make the right ones. Just another BPD female trying to right my wrongs.)
