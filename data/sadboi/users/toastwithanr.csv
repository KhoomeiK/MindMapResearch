bipolar,feny14r,t1_feibpn8,1579292539.0,"It was a 3 week program for me. Monday-Friday 10AM-4:30PM. Like any social situation, you cant predict how others will be or behave. That's part of it. You can only control yourself and how you react to the people around you. Giving up some things is definitely a barrier. It was what kept me from going for so long. My job was giving me push back about it and I didn't know where my rent was going to come from, among all of my other bills.  If it doesn't work for your life at the moment, it doesn't work. PHP isn't the only ""solution"". I hope you can find something that works for you, seriously. I'm here for ya too, I think the whole subreddit is."
bipolar2,feat6zu,t3_eo5h6a,1578951996.0,"Hi! In my experience, I got diagnosed with GAD/depression/OCD 11 years ago. I was on SSRI's all through high school and college that never seemed to do anything, no matter what I was on (2011-2018). It wasn't until I had a complete nervous breakdown after a year of intense cycles(2018ish-2019ish) that I got a BP2 diagnosis. I didn't trust it, so I went to get 3 more opinions, without me mentioning what other doctors had said, they all came up with the same thing. Except, the last psychiatrist I saw recommended that I go into a partial hospitalization program. I did and it was the best thing I've done for myself. While I was in there, I learned coping skills, emotion management, and got medications locked done, that have kept me more stable than I've ever been, for a whole month now! 

&#x200B;

Anyways, the diagnosis quite literally, saved my life. I wouldn't wish this shit upon anybody, but I am so happy that what I was going through for around a decade, was valid. Don't self diagnose and don't let Reddit diagnose you either, but I truly truly truly hope you can find the answers you're looking for. Good luck to you!"
AskReddit,fdk73bd,t3_elq6wb,1578497575.0,"Kind of.  I went out about  a month ago and had way too much to drink, more than I have, probably ever. The next day, things were definitely blurry. A few days later, I was all cozy in bed, at the brink of falling asleep. Suddenly, a memory from my drunken evening decided to make itself known. I actually gasped and put my hand over my mouth when I realized what had happened.

In my drunken state, I decided to make out with a girl on the dance floor. This girl was a total babe. We were having a lot of fun dancing and laughing. She was also dancing on a guy behind her, but I hadn't really noticed him until she said ""You have to meet my date!"" She turned around to introduce him, lo and behold, it was my ex. I made out with my ex's new girlfriend, on complete accident."
PropertyManagement,fcyq1gj,t3_ejhm5f,1578084746.0,"My company specifically says we like to stay between 600-650, BUT we look at applications as a whole. So, in some cases, we would work with lower credit with the condition of an increased deposit. As far as felonies/UDs/Evictions go, we don't allow them in the last 5 years. This has worked pretty well for us over the last 5 years. We really do try to work with everybody that we can and our tenants know this. A little bit of compassion for people who haven't had the perfect past, hasn't hurt us thus far."
bipolar,fcyoecg,t3_eji5mp,1578083846.0,"Thank you...I am going through this currently and felt really discouraged. I can tell that I'm still manic, but not to the extent I used to be. I even scheduled an emergency appointment because I thought the meds weren't working. (Which I'm still going to the appointment to go over options as I'm not loving the side effects from Lamictal.) I've felt this mania come on for the last 2 weeks and have been freaking out. Maybe I wasn't as well informed about how medication would help, as I thought all of this would go away with medication. Its making more sense now.

Anyways, thank you for sharing, this really made me feel a lot better. I hope you continue to be well."
