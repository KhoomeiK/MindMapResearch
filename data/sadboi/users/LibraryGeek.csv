In fact a lot of people think that ""real"" false confessions are rare. There is a video of a speech given by a team of (retired?) police officer and prosecutor. The biggest thing they say is don't talk. Even if you are innocent. The cops have techniques to catch you in a lie, any lie or any misstatement that will be met with the same reaction as a lie. If you say you don't know where such and such ave. is and then you mention such and such \*street\* Oh you are lying, you said you didn't know where such and such is. Things can be twisted. Most people think that if you are innocent you should be helpful. It is hard to resist the urge to be helpful or at least try to clear your name.   
It is not just a matter of smarts. It is a matter of savvy and knowledge. It is a matter of being able to not become confused when denied food/water.

 You have the \*knowledge\* that police can lie, the typical person does not have that knowledge - look how police testimonies are often automatically given higher weight in court.  


Most people don't even know that you do not have a ""right to a phone call"".  So that is a shock that can throw people off their game. Evidently, many people know you can state ""I want a lawyer"" and the questioning has to stop. (However - the cops can legally put you in jail until they get you a lawyer, or you call your own lawyer. )  
Add to all of that stress. Suppose  you are a parent worrying about getting home to your kids, or someone taking care of an elderly parent or hell, even a pet. Maybe you are worrying about losing your job. The police tell you that you can go home if you just ""confess"". They are lying of course, they can send your ass to jail til arraignment whether you confess or demand a  lawyer. Maybe they feed you enough facts in a subtle enough way that you feel you start to ""remember"" something happening.  Most people believe tv cop shows that show cops doing all sorts of borderline and outright illegal shit. Notice how all the cops and prosecutors are heroic truth tellers in the shows. Those people don't even have the protection of knowing when the real cops have crossed a line.  


Police forces have spent years of study to find the right buttons to push and the best ways to confuse people. It seems that their job is to find \*a\* guilty person, not \*the\* guilty person. This is not to say \*all\* police officers are bad or anything. They are often doing this in the name of ""getting to the truth"".

disability,fn28kzm,t1_fn10316,1586580911.0,"I had to have the required 2 semesters (for us thank goodness not 2 years at college level) waived. I am severely hard of hearing. (with a good VR at that time) Try speech reading a new language! I already had a number of supports to get through the rest of my classes. I was pretty oral at the time, using little to no sign. I too was always able to compensate because I have a highish IQ (for what they are worth). I am the opposite of you, I can communicate and learn in written form much better than I can in verbal/auditory forms.  
My private college came up with alternative classes I could take (one was a cultural one and the other was a linguistics class). But THEN the freaking classes were only offered during summer 'mini break"" classes. I was a scholarship kid and my scholarships and grants only covered the main 2 semesters. I wound up having to take Spanish 1 and 2 anyway. I got through Spanish 1 with a lot of coaching and support. At that level all of the ""conversation"" is memorized sentences back and forth.  You don't really have to hear what is being said word for word. Level 2 actually required conversation, I was lost. My teacher purposely spoke no English during class, I was lost. I was able to get thru the reading/writing of it via memorization, but level 2 required a LOT of conversation. I'm pretty sure she was kind when she gave me a D in my final semester of college. Those classes completely screwed up my GPA though :(. Luckily GPA does not matter once you are out of school for @ 5 years.   
Since then I've lost a lot of vision, so they sent me to the blind VR who happens to be blind himself.  I was a web geek that worked with website layouts and how things connected to other things on large websites (among other things but you get the picture, very visual.)  Unfortunately no HTML editors or other applications I needed will magnify the text to where I can see it . External magnification programs don't work with the HTML editors and other applications I needed to use.  My VR kept saying, there are blind programmers! I kept telling him I don't know any programming and don't have the upper level math skills to \*do\* programming. On top of that, doing web programming while blind requires you to be able to \*hear\* the results. Umm I cannot hear audio clearly enough to understand it. There is no way around that. I think he didn't grasp that even if I don't need an interpreter one to one my hearing is still too bad to work using it!  To be fair, I'm not sure he ever had vision to really understand the visual web. He did not even use a monitor.  He didn't seem to grasp that there is a visual aspect of the web that you cannot do without seeing it well.  
Long way to tell you - I feel you!"

disability,flgbhw2,t1_fla02ce,1585137939.0,"Judging from the fact that Pelosi's package included the same problem. I don't think it is malice, it is neglect and overlooking disabled and poor people. The stimulus check distribution is relying upon *last year's* taxes and who paid. Most people working will receive a full payment in that scenario. (there are the working poor who cannot get enough hours and/or pay to pay taxes as well.). There is *nothing* in the packages to exclude anyone who paid taxes.  There is no check to see if your finances were impacted by Covid-19. Thus, even people currently receiving a full paycheck or even time and a half will receive the stimulus payment. 


Those who don't meet the threshold of paying taxes include many people receiving SSI or SSDI or emergency state payments. There are also questions that have not been answered, such as will implementation of any check to people on SSDI or SSI cause them to go over their monthly limit, triggering the mechanism that subtracts from the monthly check anything you have earned over the minimum amount allowed. These policies would negating any check issued anyway. How will/will they include people who did not owe taxes. (the current packages use the disability and ""welfare"" rolls and give those people a check much lower than those that paid taxes).

I managed to get thru this winter w/o steroids because I mostly didn't go anywhere since I cannot drive and my wife temporarily cannot drive.  
No, panic does not help and can also stress your immune system. But what seems like over reaction by officials is based upon scientific and medical knowledge gained from countries that had different outcomes (s. korea vs. Italy for example). If you are in the US, people are not able to get tested even when they have symptoms if they have not traveled or come into contact with someone who has traveled. Which is stupidly stupid. We have community transmission in the US - that means people have wound up in the ICU that have no connection to travel. Incubation period is 3-14 days. So it can take a while to show symptoms and some people never develop symptoms but are still carrying the virus. Thus, you don't know if you have come into contact."
