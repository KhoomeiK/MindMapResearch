She is a very nice teacher, she does a lot for the school here like run the LGBTQ group and yell at staff who arent doing their job or just made a student feel like poo.

As for the counselor, yes, back in the begining of middle school I spoke with one and spilled my guts out since I didnt know what else to do, I was feeling really depressed with life and my mom and dad did nothing but fight. I mentioned I wanted to hurt myself and she told my parents. The main source of my depression. We had a talk and when I got home they held it over my head and my mom yelled at me to stop feeling that way, so I did, everytime I felt that way I always ignored it and bottled it up. 

I never knew that about the crops, my teacher told me that about the brain because I wasn't worried with my grades and moving on with life, but worried if I'll make it to the next day. Guess it works with people too.

AskReddit,ex6jh01,t3_crlc5w,1566046691.0,"My Brother dropped out at Grade 10 because of his girlfriend and begun living with her and her druggie father, we got him butt calling my family and he was doing Heroine while his gf was ""with"" some other guys, it shocked us even our uncle who did nothing but weed. I must add the Gf is a spoiled girl.

That changed when my dad/school did a poor job at teaching sex ed and how to put on a condom, getting his girlfriend pregnant, after that he changed in a good way, stopped doing what he was doing and preparing for the baby, even moving into a better place. Even though my parents(and me) me didn't like her, they decided to help them. Gf gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, then they moved out and left the state to live with gf's well off grandparents to help raise the baby, brother and gf ended up getting their GED.

Soon the two get married, My dad, uncle, and I travel to see it. It wasn't nothing fancy, everyone was wearing something casual, but bro was holding their baby. 

After that they came back to live in home state with their kid who is now a toddler, but this is where things get rocky. The two of them decided to move back in with gf's dad, which now I look back on wasnt the best idea. Gf is same old gf, something she did was steal my uncle's phone then breaking it, whist my brother defended her, even he said that someone stole it. Before that, my brother came by and dropped off his kid, asking me to babysit, saying he would come back in a few hours. I agree and I dont see/hear from him and the sun had already set, my dad and I get child ready to bed and are able to put her to sleep, all is peaceful until my dad gets a phone call from gf's dad. Turns out, my brother snapped at her behavior while he was drunk, how he's the one making the money while she is playing on her phone and spending money on make up, he ended up hitting her and my uncle slipped out and told the neighbor were they called 911, brother got a nice spot in a jail cell and my dad had to pick up gf and her dad from the hospital, with as well bailing my brother out. So we woke up the sleeping child and drove there without a carseat. Some how the two made up and continued living together, with nothing changing.

Kid ends up moving back with grandparents, while the two save up and move back. Now my brother and gf have their own place, while kid stays with grandparents who seems to be turning out better than her mom. Uncle was supposed to go move in with them but didn't want to have to live with gf since they still dont get along and he couldnt get a job with his record of getting caught growing weed which is now clear, but its okay because he'd a cool guy to hang out with. Brother is now in community college to get a job were he bulids houses. He still asks my mom for money though, which she did even when I told her not too since it was probably going towards the gf to spend, even when my mom and I are also struggling.

Last I heard from him which was last night, was that gf kicked brother out when they were playing ""love games""(mum's words) and someone slept with someone to make the other jealous, then he asked for some money for his phone bill, and how he wanted to come back down to visit. Still waiting for response on how that turns out."
