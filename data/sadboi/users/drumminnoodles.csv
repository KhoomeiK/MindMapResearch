ProCreate,fmy6bcw,t1_fmy4d8k,1586479054.0,"I did a bunch of YouTube tutorials, mostly by ArtWithFlo.  Doing those taught me about the functionality of procreate, and how to shade and color, and some basic drawing.  Also a couple of tutorials by artforkidshub and drawsocute, but they use paper and markers in their videos so I just tried to do whatever they were doing but on my iPad.  For more in depth on how to draw, I did the first section of Drawabox, and also I did the drawing lessons on ctrlpaint.com.  For the eye, there’s a YouTube channel called brushes and bunnies, she has a video series on portraits, I’ve finished video # 3 at this point.  

So basically just following a bunch of random free lessons/tutorials that I found online.  I want to finish the brushes and bunnies series, then probably find something on figure drawing.

I’m still going to work but all of my after work activities have stopped,  so now when I get home I just work on the stuff I’m trying to learn.  I play 2 instruments (one not very well but I’m learning), and I’m also learning to draw, and since the quarantine I’ve started doing yoga every day with videos from YouTube.  I’ve had back pain for almost a year now because of a slipped disc and the quarantine has finally given me the time to actually do something about it.  

Another factor for me is that when this started both of my roommates went to stay with other people, so I’ve been home alone too, which is way less stressful for me.  I can make as much noise as I want at whatever times I want, which is nice.

I haven’t seen my fiancé in over a week at this point, since someone at my work got covid-19 I’ve been self quarantining and only going to work and home.  I miss him, but it has been interesting to see all the other ways I could spend that time that I was spending with him.  He has his own stuff he’s working on, he plays 4 instruments and he’s started meditating every day with an app, so he’s not too distressed about it either despite him not even leaving home to go to work since he works from home now.

Also, I don’t know if you’ve been in a hospital lately, but they’re not staffed for caring for patients without any help from the patients families.  Things like helping with hygiene, bed baths, trips to the toilet for people who can’t ambulate on their own, and caring for newborns after birth- hospitals don’t have enough nurses or other staff to do this.
