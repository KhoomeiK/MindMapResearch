Sadly my fetish was never really interesting to my therapists. I talked about it a couple times and pushed the topic in a couple times, but it was always left at ""It's okay, find a compromise, learn to control it."".

And it's all part of humanity and life on earth, so yes! I also want to be everything and embody everything. But I can't. That left me completely passive until I was about 22 or 23 (now I'm 25) and then I started jumping in and out of roles a lot. And I can see much clearer now how my upbringing affected me, because even if I don't like it, I actually can't really be everything (at the moment). For example I'm an introverted, shy person. I will maybe never jump to the middle in a group position, pull out a board and lead the group writing down the most important points, for example. Lol.

I can see 4w3 for sure. Back when I was into MBTI and Enneagram I was stuck on INFP (but sometimes thinking about INFJ, ENFP and INTP) and not sure about 9w8, 9w1, 4w3 and 4w5. I'm now sure I'm not a 4w5, it just doesn't match. I prefer more light, more society, more acceptance, more adapting. 

Between 4w3 and 9 I'm still not 100% sure. When I got bullied in school I was seeking harmony. I never fought back. I just smiled all the time. But I was a child. As a still healthy child I did care about harmony, but not to that degree. My family was all about harmony, so it was in me. My own feelings were more important though. 

Example: I didn't like the kindergarden, so I just stood in the corner and cried. All day. Sometimes I opened up, but when there was a care taker I didn't like I just cried all day with my hands in front of my eyes. Until I got picked up. Hahaha. I was a very creative, introverted child. But also manipulative. I wanted it my way. I also had social anxiety. For example I manipulated my mom into thinking school starts earlier than it actually does, so I would naturally start playing with other kids and didn't have to take the initiative to ask to join. At home I either wanted to hang out with a close friend or be creative. Or both! :) I never liked physical activity. 

&#x200B;

So, as a child: individuality/my personality > harmony, but both were important to me. That's why I prefered to use manipulation. These days it's kinda tied and as a teenager it was harmony > individuality/my personality. Because of my bad experiences. I finally wanted to fit in somehwere. But inside I was a whole different person. Very dark, mean, emotional. I let it out on the internet."

It's not a bad or shameful reason, it's completely valid. 

I can give you an example from my life as an ex self harmer, mainly cutting. It was the only way I was able to express the pain and hurt I felt. It was the only way for me to be seen. To get attention. Love. Care. Because I didn't know any other way that worked for me. I loved every new scar, because it meant getting seen more.

Could I have stopped self harming any time? Yes, for sure. It was always a decision. No one forced me. Did I want to stop? Kinda yeaaa, but really no. Because it gave me things I thought I couldn't get any other way.

But: our feelings usually try to tell us something. What exactly is something you can figure out. I only have this very small piece of text here. :)

So, my guess: you usually write about external things. Friends, your PS4, girlfriends and not much about internal things. But you pretty much figured that out already.
So what can you do to be with yourself and to find/build some internal ressources?
Maybe it's worth it to think and write down what is important to you? Any values? Anything you want to stand for? Anything you want to fight for? Maybe volunteer somewhere? Help people?

One advice: talking about symptoms and diagnosis and all that is a different world for most. They don't understand that. Imagine a biologist explaining the body parts of an ant to you in latin.

It's really good and easy.

Other than that, try to breathe into your stomach. Put your hand on your stomach. Feel the air blowing up your stomach and feel it flattening again. It should help.

Ask yourself what you can do better if someone gets rage attacks. Maybe you could leave.

I'm pretty exhausted today. Whenever I want to talk about something emotional/serious or want something from him he either shuts down or gets angry.

Thank you! We are in the same boat there. I was somehow able to finish my Fachabitur in the middle of my illness, but then horribly failed at University and got into drugs there, because I truly didn't know what to do anymore. 

Thats good, that you are planning to get help again! Short hospital visits can do wonders for feeling stable again, at least in my experience. When I'm in crisis I still sometimes go to one for a night or two. Usually just to think ""No way! I don't want this anymore!"" and then it's like a shadow leaving me and I can think clearly again. I hate it so much that it helps me, haha. But, I have to say, I was kind of addicted to being sick and helpless. So going to hospitals was a thing I hateloved in the past, that's where the ""I don't want this anymore!"" comes from.

That's so annoying with the insurance companies. I hope they will let you get another therapist soon! There are also actual clinics for OCD. I think it's very difficult, because you do things like exposure therapy, but they are experts for sure. Maybe that could also be helpful for you. Maybe you can get some control over your life back. Right now it seems like a Teufelskreis. You are feeling helpless and the OCD is a way to get some control back, some safety, but in reality it's only creating more helplessness. Maybe."

There were a lot of steps involved, but now I'm stable and content when most things are fine, and also not a destructive mess anymore when things go wrong. So that's nice! Only work is still a huge trigger, but that's because I kept trying to force myself like ""I'm recovered now! Working 8 hours a day has to be possible!"", so after Corona I will start different approaches with the Jobcenter.

That's so awesome that you have so many hobbies you like to do and that you can fill your time. Almost sounds comfortable.

I completely agree, my hospital visits were mostly the same. I experienced 4 horrible hospitals only focusing on getting me ready for society again and on meds, 1 ok experience and luckily 2 very good hospitals. They were Tageskliniken and focused in psychotherapy. There was meditational stuff, awareness, history of mental illness, education about it in general... it helped me a lot both times.

Have you ever have an actual psychotherapist? Like outside of the hospital?

I personally have been diagnosed (with depression and BPD) at the age of 15 and now I'm 25. With 15 I was in the hospital for the first time and I was very sick for a long time.

I think you sound very reflected and smart! And I think I can understand your situation and I feel like you are trying to make the best out of it, which is great.

I only want to leave you one little piece of thought:
I also didn't think healing was possible for me. Doctors and psychotherapist (especially in hospitals) often have a very clinical and science-based view of things, which is good, but in my experience only a part of things. 
The body and the emotions often get left behind a little bit, it's more about thoughts and behavior there. I don't know if you experienced the same. 
I started healing after I integrated those two things more, mainly thanks to a new therapist I went to. He worked very ""earthy"", sometimes it almost had a spiritual touch or so it at least felt to me. A lot of body and emotion work. A lot of work on the past. Trauma work. Everything can be a trauma. Maybe that could be worth a try for you one day, who knows. You find them googling ""K√∂rpertherapie"", ""Tiefenpsychotherapie"", stuff like that."

And girls who are not interested in you can get scared, talk shit about you with their friends, laugh about you or whatever. But that's because they are not interested anyways. But if you don't take the risk, the girl who actually likes you will also view you as non-needy. And that's not good. Of course I'm not talking about spamming someone 4 messages one after the other or constantly messaging while the girl is not responding at all. But that's just common sense (usually). If you keep it to a middle ground then it's a good thing. Just no extremes. And if you don't act extreme it's also the girls responsibility to tell you that she is not actually interested. Most are too much of a chicken for that, unfortunately. So they ghost instead. ""Too needy"" usually just means ""I'm not interested"".

You shouldn't worry about your appearance, you look like you take good care of it.

You should maybe think about your inner self though.
Do you think looks are the most important thing in a relationship? Not at all. There are so many different tastes and likes and looks. Everyone likes something else anyways.
And it's more about caring about your appearance and that shows.
Other than that it's about what you say, your confidence, your passion, your emotions, your vulnerability, your soul."

amiugly,flvgkug,t1_flvf481,1585523356.0,"Why are you acting non-needy? A relationship is literally about needing each other. You want the other one to be as close as possible and never leave again. You want to be one. Of course the healthy adult inside of us creates some healthy boundaries... but the vibe is ""I need you and I can't live without you, you fullfill me!"" at least for a few months. And then as time passes individuality gets more and more important again. But not at the beginning. 
If I got the ""not needy""-vibe from someone I will not be interested in a close friendship or a relationship.

And relationships are also intense. You will get to know the beautiful, fun, loving side of someone, but also the dark, needy, manipulative side. Two people see each other naked. Emotionally and physically. Otherwise that's called one night stands or friendship plus. So you got what you put out there."

It's also good if you have pictures someone took while you didn't know and you were naturally smiling. That's a good guideline.

Other than that, if I smile for a picture, I first form a light smile with my mouth. Then it's the most important to get the smile to your eyes,otherwise it looks fake. Like wrinkle them a bit, close them a tiny bit. Imagine love and warmness and relax your vision and face. Maybe that's a weird explaination, but that's how it works for me."

In my opinion it's not because of your looks.
Sometimes it just takes time. One night stands are very superficial, but you are not about that game, right? Love, romance, that stuff doesn't have much to do with looks."

My boyfriend did the same once. He even asked me before and we live together, so it's okay he did that.
But I hated it so much. I felt like a stranger at home. I had to give it some time and my touch.

And we can never be 100% sure on who to trust. We can only play with the odds. Someone can always be mean to us. We just have to be better than that. There's nothing we have to be ashamed of."

I also still have one topic/situation which heavily triggers me and sadly is a normal part of life. So I shut down at least once a week for like a day.

I also have a friend who is severly depressed for like 10 years now and not getting better. I'm sorry to say it, but I also don't feel a lot anymore when she talks to me. But it's also because she uses her illness to get the love and care she so deeply wishes for and I don't want to give it to her that way.

Can you imagine reasons for why your friends don't care a lot anymore? Have they cared in the past? Are you very dramatic? Are you talking about your agonizing pain or the issues behind that pain? Are you getting help?

Also: some people just aren't good friends. It really depends.

But my friends care if I'm in crisis. We usually send voice messages back and forth. But I'm also not often in crisis and kinda easy to calm down. If it's very intense I try to cool myself down first before talking to someone, because I know it drains a lot of energy."

So you dissociate. You or the would just disappears.

It's usually caused by a subjective helplessness. Subjective, because usually there are ways to handle a situation better.

You have experienced a lot of trauma, a lot of high stress for a long time and you weren't able to cope or work through stuff. So it was way too much for your soul to handle, so you just shut down and turned on auto pilot. That's also why you can't remember much. That's pretty common.
We want to protect ourselves from those horrible memories.

The good thing is: you can still work through stuff now."

mentalillness,flkyeti,t3_fp4qih,1585250028.0,"""Your brain doesn't work right."" is one of the most basic and simple explanations for mental illness. There is no depth to it at all.

Every mental illness has a root somewhere. And every mental illness is valid. No super crazy horrible things need to happen to a person to have a valid mental illness. A child getting sent to its room everytime it cries? That can cause trauma/mental illness. A child hearing ""Don't be sad!"" all the time? That can cause trauma/mental illness. There are so many things that can cause us pain and suffering as a child, teenager or adult in this society and some things we can shake off, some things heal, but some things stick around.

Things that are very normal or basic to an adult or parent can cause huge suffering to a child. 

You can go on that route and look deep inside of you.

Do you know the things that trigger your anxiety attacks and dissociations? If not, oberve what happens before they get triggered.. That's the first step. Writing things down can help. Then you try to see what you feel and think and so on. There are some more steps until you reach the root or one of the roots. If you are interested in the other steps, google or ask me in the comments. :)"

Think about people you see on the street. People with all kinds of appearances are in relationships. Only if it's extreme, it really matters. Like no hygiene, very overweight, stuff like that. You are completely fine.

Maybe the girls sense your emotional wall, too. That is a warning sign to most people.
Love is about letting all your guards down. Your partner will see you in the ugliest, most nasty way you can be. Not just what can be on the outside, but also on the inside. Are you able to show that and let your guards down?

And also: you date maybe 40 girls and then with girl #41 the magic happens. Especially if you date online, you meet and then see if the magic happens or if it doesn't. You just have to try and try again. That's just how dating is."

Seeing shadow people could be worth bringing up to your therapist.
But what exactly to you mean with that?
We all can see shadows in the corner of our vision. They can move, stay still or we just ""feel like something is there"". That's completely normal. Most of us are barely aware of it, because it doesn't really matter. Some people can get very paranoid at night because of it.
