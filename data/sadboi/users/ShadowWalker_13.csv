ptsd,fmrroz3,t3_fwxhep,1586333020.0,"I think the best advice I can give is to not give advice.  You cant fix it but you can help.  Take it slowly  Make sure you communicate and ask your SO what they need from you, what they need to hear.  Everyone is different with different triggers and different needs.  If your SO can't articulate what they need or what can help (I really struggle with this) it might help to see a counselor to work out what you could do to help and understand what they are going through.  For me sometimes I just need to be with someone and cry and not be judged."
ptsd,fmrqgvi,t3_fwdk5j,1586331748.0,I've done EMDR for several different events.  It really helped processing my SIL suicide attempt.  It wasn't as successful for my more complex trauma that has a lot of layers including events that happened during high school.  It always left me tired and emotional after the session.  It can get worse before it gets better.  It's kind of like the psychological version of a treatment I got in physical therapy to break up scar tissue and inflammation.  Its hard to explain but they would take a device and run it over my injury and have me tell them where it hurt the most.  Then they would concentrate where it hurt.  It wasn't pleasant but it did help in the long run.
ptsd,fmrptb9,t3_fwi3nm,1586331073.0,"I'm sorry you had to deal with that and are suffering.  I know exactly how you feel.  I'll ball my eyes out at work and my manager is super supportive but I always feel guilty for ""dumping all my trauma"" on her no matter how many times she tells me its fine. Then one of the other managers at work told me he wasn't a counselor.  He wasn't trying to brush me off but he was soooooo lost dealing with something he couldn't fix.  I read somewhere that when you feel guilty when you do get emotional support it's not you dumping the weight on them, its them taking the weight on themselves.  I take that idea one step further and those who don't give us the emotional support can't handle that weight or know what to do about it.  Not everyone can handle emotions or understand what you are dealing with.  I've found 4 safe people who are happy to help me when I lose it.     While the one manager is not one of those people he still cares enough to check in with me on how I'm doing. I try not to give advice, just share what has helped me.  I hope you have or can find your safe people."

They were living with me at the time and I was terrified if I went to sleep I'd wake up to find the kids dead.  I called the cops and her parents and mine.  The cops couldn't do anything because she puts on a good act.  She finally went to her parents house with the kids so I knew the kids would be looked after.  But it really screwed me up and it was even worse when she moved back in after a month in rehab and acted like she was the victim.  It took me a month to finally kick them out but I feel guilty for even that since it felt like I was abandoning the kids.
