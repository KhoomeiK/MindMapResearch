MakeupRehab,fqgdrwz,t3_gio4vy,1589343711.0,"I definitely agree. I used it once because I wanted to buy something for myself and something for my friend’s birthday from the same site, and it didn’t make sense to split up the purchases bc shipping cost. I technically had the money, but was iffy on spending quite that much and wanted to see how Afterpay worked. 

I can’t even explain why, but getting notifications like a month later that my $10 payment to colourpop was completed successfully was just so.... weird. It makes impulse purchasing easier in the moment, but then you’re reminded of it for weeks afterward. Maybe I just felt bad because I hadn’t used the item yet lol. 

I won’t fault people if it works for them, but I never want to do it again. There’s nothing cosmetic I need that badly I need to string it out between multiple pay checks."
