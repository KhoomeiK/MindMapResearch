If you mean, ultra-Orthadox, that is honestly an opinion shared by most Jews. With the exception of Chabadniks, who are generally quite lovely. I disagree completely with their religiousness, but they are quite accepting. And, yeah, as you mentioned, in Israel, they cause the most problems with the Arabs (settlements, exc), and contribute nada to the state (excempt from military service, often have them and their litter of kids on welfare because they can't get a job other than 'be ultraorthadox'). Most Israeli Jews hate their guts...especially the Neturi Kata and Satmars."
