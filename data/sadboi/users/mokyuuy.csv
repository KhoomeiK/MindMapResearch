Nanny,f8gwg9x,t3_e0sxyf,1574566120.0,it‚Äôs a little frustrating because there‚Äôs only so much you can do with little ones inside the house & outside. there‚Äôs a ton of fun activities you can find online but it can be difficult to actually do them depending on so many things. i would 100x rather work for a family that lets me take the kids places than not. i can‚Äôt stand being cooped up inside and the kids can‚Äôt either.

AsianBeauty,ew5x6wv,t3_cmmb3n,1565147443.0,"has anyone tried the face shops ‚Äúperfect sunscreen liquid‚Äù?

i went to the face shop to get try some sunscreen for my upcoming beach trip. 

i looked at the ‚Äúperfect sunscreen liquid‚Äù and really liked the consistency of it, but i was afraid it wasn‚Äôt gonna last in the ocean (or at all for that matter).

i ended up going for the perfect sunscreen cream because the other two cream left a really bad white cast & im pretty dark so i was not running with that haha

i wanna know if anyone else has experience with the sunscreen liquid? i like the softness it gives to my skin but not sure if it‚Äôs actually effective.

let me know~"
