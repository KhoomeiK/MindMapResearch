Un día uno de nuestros partidos salió mal ya que uno de.los chicos recibió un golpe fuertísimo en la nariz y se la quebraron, había sangre por todos lados, a todo eso entra la profe al aula y ve al pibe tirado y sangre por todos lados, se horrorizó y salió al grito de ""LO MATÓ, LO MATARON!!!"" Ese fue nuestro último partido de rugby.


Otra de 4to, un tiempo después de la suspensión del rugby decidimos buscar un nuevo deporte para jugar en los recreos, al fútbol, obviamente dentro del aula, en uno de nuestros partidos el mismo chico de la nariz rota rompió una de las ventanas de un pelotazo, aclaro que nuestra aula quedaba en el segundo piso y de pedo no le cayó algún vidrio a algún chico que estaba en el recreo abajo, cuestión es que antes de que pudimos fugarnos vino la preceptora y al toque llegó la vicedirectora, ya a todo esto acomodamos los bancos y nos sentamos cada uno en su lugar sin decir nada, sin reirnos aunque tentados estabamos. Llega la vice, nos mira y dice de una ""tienen un minuto para decirme quien fue o les hago un acta a todos"", nadie hablaba hasta que el culpable decidió romper el silencio diciendo ""yo le voy a decir lo que pasó... vino una paloma y se chocó contra el vidrio."" Literalmente todos estallamos de la risa, la vice se fue enfurecida y después de un tiempo el culpable se entregó y listo, la ligó él solo. Que buenos tiempos."

My dad was with me during my childhood and it was tough having to get used to the idea of not having him around at times, although it was for the best since he and my mom split due to his drug addiction and violence towards her. Ten years have passed and he was never able to get his life back together, he can barely keep jobs and has been unemployed most of the time, he's almost always had to live with a friend since he could never afford his own place and even though I sort of feel bad for him I think I still strongly resent him for not being there, at least economically, to help raise my brother, who tells me that to him I'm like his father and he sees me that way. I find it unfair to my brother that at 13 years old he has to consider me to be his father figure but I guess that's life, I believe I did a good job with him and turned out ok myself."
