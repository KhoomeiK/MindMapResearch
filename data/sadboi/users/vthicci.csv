also, the fact that that many meds have been tried and the behavior has continued (and seemingly worsened) means that there is a way bigger issue than chemical imbalance. dbt and family therapy is the way to go. because this extreme behavior started up kind of out of no where, there may have been something really traumatic that happened to her around the time this started or in her childhood that triggered this behavior. there is definitely something that has happened to her that is causing or is a part of the cause of this behavior. pm me if u need to talk about it, i definitely haven‚Äôt been at the extremes that your daughter is at right now but i was unstable/reckless/a drug addict for years and have learned a lot about mental health and treatment because of it.

a big thing that would help: getting her sober. look into a teen apg group. that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm in and it‚Äôs helped a lot. and maybe group therapy, it helps to have a support system outside of home."

alcoholism,fmakkbx,t1_fmai3nf,1585897346.0,"You think you can't get over her, but you can. It took my ex a YEAR to get over me, but she did it. This sucks to hear, and is something that I would get mad at when I was in my addiction and on reddit posting about my issues, but you have to stop just sitting around and feeling bad for yourself and actually do something about your issues. It is up to you whether or not you can be happy. That may sound completely ridiculous but I understand where you are in life right now, I was in so much fucking pain but I'm doing way better and no longer drinking because I finally made the decision to get help. Stop saying ""I can't get over her"" and ""I just need alcohol to forget what happened"" because that is NOT TRUE. You CAN get over her, and you shouldn't forget what happened because the only way to heal is to confront your problems. No matter how long you spending drinking and distracting yourself, it will never go away until it is addressed. I've replied to you 3 times and said this 3 times but I'll say it again, PLEASE get yourself some help. It took me a while of people saying that to me and even trying to force me before I did but it is the best thing you can do for yourself. Of course it isn't fun at first, but I'm actually able to feel ok without alcohol now which one month ago was complete bullshit to me. I legit thought I would just end up drinking myself to death and had just decided that was going to be my fate and let myself continue fucking my life up. If you want to be happy, then take action. Reddit is nice for advice and ranting, but at the end of the day the most effective thing is going to be putting yourself out there and getting professional help from people who have worked with many many people who go through the same thing as you. If you don't want to go to therapy or rehab or can't afford it, go to AA. It is free and so fucking amazing, honestly I thought it was gonna be stupid the first time I went in but I ended up just crying in the middle of it because of how much I connected and felt understood by complete strangers. Everyone there is always super welcoming and loving, and all support each other as a whole. Just one meeting could change your life or help push you in the right direction. All you have to do is sit there for an hour, you don't have to talk or anything if you don't want to. Just listen, and see how you feel."
alcoholism,fmajxod,t1_fm9vo51,1585896705.0,"You really don't know though. You're not psychic. The future can surprise you. 

If you want a connection again, then work on yourself and get yourself some help!! If you can't love yourself, you can't fully love anyone else. You will attract more people once you are in a healthier mental spot. Break ups are really really hard but there are SO many other people out there, don't just assume there is no one else for you. 

I did what you're doing a lot during my addiction. I would just say, ""there's no point, everything is already fucked up so why not fuck shit up more, this will never end"" etc etc. When you think you've hit rock bottom, you feel like there's no point in trying, but TRUST ME you haven't yet. I met a guy in AA who lost his house and had his kids taken away due to how severe his addiction had gotten. Don't let it get to that point. Fight for yourself and your future. 

If you truly do want to get better, take that step. If going to therapy or rehab sounds like too much, just sit in on an online AA meeting. You don't even have to talk or show your face."
alcoholism,fmajkcj,t3_ftycjf,1585896330.0,"Trust me, alcohol definitely won't work after a bit. Don't get yourself deeper into the hole that you are in. Soon instead of numbing your feelings or making you feel better it just makes you feel even more depressed and ashamed because it becomes such a problem. I am now one month sober and SO glad I made that decision for myself. It was hard and I didn't want to stop for a long time, but it seriously is worth it. Even though the things you are going through are really really hard, they're always gonna be there to bother you until you start working through them. You can get through it , I thought I would NEVER ever be able to stop and here I am. Numbing your emotions with alcohol is going to delay the healing process of your issues. You should try out an AA meeting, I guarantee it'll help. Even if you're not fully ready to stop, just sitting in and listening to other people share seriously really helps you and opens your eyes to a lot of things."
alcoholism,fm61ll5,t3_ft2zhi,1585784388.0,PLEASE go to an online aa meeting the first one i went to i honestly thought was gonna be stupid but it actually really really helps and it‚Äôs nice to have so many people who you can relate to and genuinely care.

AmItheAsshole,fl3dgwx,t3_fm3yu7,1584778804.0,"This relationship sounds very very toxic. You may not want to admit it to yourself, but if you're not stupid you would know that she is definitely cheating on you. No normal person would communicate with their ex and even hang out with them that much if they were in a committed relationship. While I don't think that you adding the girl on snapchat was a good idea, I think that her accusing you of cheating and constantly monitoring what you do is her projecting what she is doing onto you, which is something a lot of cheaters will do."

you're 19 so I dont see you getting one as a problem, BUT if youre going to do it wear a horse shoe typed one and keep it flipped up when youre home, my parents didn't even notice I had one until I forgot to flip it up. I feel like that would be a good compromise, because then they dont have to see it but you are still able to make your own decisions about what you do with your body. You don't even have to tell them about it if you don't want to if you just flip it up which is nice :)"

Psychosis,fgni9ly,t3_ezbkd4,1580945449.0,"I take risperidone and was super scared to start it but I haven‚Äôt had any serious side effects. The only thing I have noticed is an increase in appetite which has caused some weight gain, but it has helped with my social anxiety a LOT. I really recommend anti psychotics if you are having psychotic symptoms, it‚Äôs seriously worth it. If you‚Äôre super worried about side effects, start out with a small dose and see how it makes you feel."

Psychosis,fepcjht,t1_fep0up8,1579317180.0,"I take risperidone and I‚Äôve only been taking it for two weeks so it‚Äôs pretty recent but I‚Äôve already noticed a difference, I haven‚Äôt been psychotic, my attitude towards life in general has been more optimistic and my severe anxiety is now manageable which is a big big plus. My situation was very recent but it was still a process and took a lot for me to really process what was going on and allow myself to get better instead of letting myself dwell on the dark things that I was used to. All it takes is you, as long as you truly want to get better you can achieve it. I take 0.5mg and I have had zero side effects, it also helps me fall asleep (normally makes me tired 30-40min after taking it) which is very nice since I often couldn‚Äôt even get tired until 2am. I really do recommend starting meds I was scared bc I read about side effects and didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with that but a lot of it depends on your dosage. Of course everybody‚Äôs body is different so I can‚Äôt say that is the case for everyone, but I really do recommend it, even if you end up reacting badly to antipsychotics you can still take other medications to help you a lot with your emotional symptoms."
mentalhealth,fepbutt,t1_feok7ix,1579316719.0,Also I have a therapist and she knows I can get very very irritated but I don‚Äôt normally focus on my anger when I‚Äôm having a session it comes up mostly situationally too.
