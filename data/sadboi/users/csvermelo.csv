whatsthisplant,fqa3qx5,t1_fqa24u0,1589212288.0,So thanks to your advice I googled possible bugs and I think it may be scale insects!
whatsthisplant,fqa2vka,t1_fqa24u0,1589211838.0,Damn :( I will leave it as unresolved in case anyone can identify it by name but I will try your suggestions! Thank you so much for the quick response and tips.
csMajors,fprqnrd,t3_gf50tw,1588860133.0,"No don‚Äôt give up. I did well in Java and bombed my first C class, especially since the professor taught at 1,000 mph. U/MakBoz suggestion of CS50 is great, you can check that out and see how you like it. What helped me the most was going to my university‚Äôs computer science help room. I found a tutor I really clicked with and spent 15+ hours there a week when I was taking data structures. I can‚Äôt recommend a course since I‚Äôm searching for the same but what seriously helped outside of practice was discussing assignments with classmates and the help room."

Songwriting,fn4k2uw,t3_fz0s4v,1586642988.0,Check out the book ‚ÄúWriting Better Lyrics‚Äù by Pat Pattinson. It‚Äôs great and he uses a ton of exercises so you can start experimenting right away. The author-who‚Äôs a professor at Berklee-also has a songwriting course for free on Coursera (Songwriting: Writing the Lyrics).
csMajors,fmuj7pa,t3_fx055f,1586392473.0,"I‚Äôm going through something similar and will probably graduate 4 years ‚Äúlate‚Äù. A guy who works at my university‚Äôs comsci help room failed our C class 2 times before passing. My friend who now has an internship had to retake at least two courses (data structures was one) and felt like his life was over back when he failed them. Talk to your professors in terms of options. A year ago I was allowed two incompletes by simply meeting with and explaining my struggles to my professors. They care more than you would think. Take care of your mental health and keep in mind that whether it takes 4 or 9 years to get it, a degree in our field is a degree."

cscareerquestions,fh9hhtk,t3_f1y8w0,1581381440.0,"Hey, I‚Äôm going through a very similar situation to you. I won‚Äôt be answering the question you‚Äôre asking but want to share what I‚Äôm doing and hope it can help you. I lost my financial aid as well after having a low Satisfactory Academic Progress percentage. Talk to your advisor about taking a semester off. At my university, you can stay unenrolled for up to a year and all you have to do to get back in is to contact your advisor for a code to sign up for classes. The process might be a little different if the school doesn‚Äôt think you are ready to return. In case you truly want to leave, then you just don‚Äôt contact your advisor after the year passes. What is helpful about this option (which I‚Äôm taking) is that you won‚Äôt have to reapply to enter the university should you manage to make some progress with your mental health within that timeframe. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, I lost my financial aid because I also struggle with a personality disorder I‚Äôve been trying to treat for years now. I wish you the best regardless of the choice you make."

iastate,fff425q,t3_esnpzb,1579875147.0,"Here is a law my old roommate used to get our apartment‚Äôs washing machine fixed after months of it being broken:  The Uniform Residential and Tenant Law 562A.21. You have to write a notice to your landlord giving them 7 days to fix the issue, and if they don‚Äôt fix it, you are entitled to terminate your rental agreement. It can‚Äôt be used for everything though, so look it up to see whether it applies to your specific situation. Feel free to inbox me for questions. I have used a similar Florida law when my mom‚Äôs landlord wouldn‚Äôt fix hot water issues."
