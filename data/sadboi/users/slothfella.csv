My bigger issue this year has been explaining absences. I feel so guilty about it and I always worry that my professor or TA will think I'm just making something up bc I know other people do. So far I've just gotten a doctors note every time (for hospitalizations, bad depressive days, etc).  This is a lot to go through everytime. If I go back to my disability center, are they required to give me accommodations for absences like this? I didn't really like my advisor last time I went to I want to be sure to have a list of things I need when I go in next"
