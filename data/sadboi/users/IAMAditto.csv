But right now I’m on meds that theoretically should work based on the test results and, while they’re not giving me horrible side effects, they’re not helping my mood much either."

mentalillness,fo1zcco,t1_fo1yzaf,1587445239.0,"I think I was diagnosed with add or something (idk, since I was a minor I wasn’t allowed to know my own diagnosis) and prescribed Ritalin, but my psych took me off of it after a few months. Recently I told my new psychiatrist about these symptoms and she said they’re just regular symptoms of depression and that they’ll go away if I take my SNRIs."
mentalillness,fo1xhue,t3_g56jf2,1587443853.0,"Yep :(

I was prescribed Zoloft at 14-15 and it fucked my head up so bad. I would sleep so much, and when I was asleep NOTHING could wake me up. I was late for school almost every morning, and would fall asleep in every class. And when I was awake my head was empty. I couldn’t carry a conversation or a train of thought and my grades started dropping.

When I told my psychiatrist about these side effects, she straight up didn’t believe me about any of it. She told me to keep taking the meds and had me tested for mono. When the results came back and I didn’t have mono, she just put me on Prozac, which was only slightly better.

Most of the psychiatrists I’ve seen were incompetent on some level. Even the competent ones haven’t helped at all. A psych ward psychiatrist told me it wouldn’t matter if I killed myself. A different psychiatrist accused me of lying about my mental health so I could get Adderall.

I’m eighteen now and my brain is like mashed potatoes. I started high school at the top of my class of 1000 kids but four years later I barely graduated. I’m in college now and I simply can’t keep up with the schoolwork - I can’t pay attention to a lecture for more than 30 seconds, can’t read a book, and can’t even carry a conversation without getting lost.

Maybe there’s just something wrong with me. I’ve been on nine different psych medications and none of them really made a difference. But I’ve seen this happen to other people, too. My roommate this year takes Zoloft and sleeps for most of the day. She’s still depressed when she’s awake, though.

Sorry for the rant, I just hate that our knowledge of mental health is so basic and limited but doctors and psychiatrists think that they have all the answers. It’s shitty. Not to mention expensive as hell"
