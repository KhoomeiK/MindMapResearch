CODWarzone,fr3wqly,t3_gm9bbf,1589868459.0,"crouch walking audio definitely needs to be addressed as well. crouch down, move around, you‚Äôre quieter. but as soon as you try to crouch walk up a flight of stairs you might as well be full out sprinting and banging pots and pans, the difference between crouch walking flat ground and crouch walking stairs is insane.

and maybe it‚Äôs just me, but don‚Äôt drop plates, money, etc, for any teammates while you‚Äôre on stairs either because it just falls through the stairs. numerous plates and cash bundles lost to this.


nothing worse than team wiping the guys making a racket just to turn around and have another team in your face out of nowhere with no audio whatsoever.

figure it the fuck out."
