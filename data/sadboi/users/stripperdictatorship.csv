trashy,fqb3ln2,t1_fqaoykf,1589229989.0,Can you share your knowledge on how to help grape vines? I just moved into a place the owners said the vines give lots of grapes later in the year. How do I help produce lots of fruit? They are growing like crazy right now. Went from just a few to tons very quickly.
Asthma,fpv4pv7,t3_gflyaz,1588934810.0,"Hey I’m in a similar boat 19f EDS the pain has been real bad for at least 3 years now completely runs my life without cannabis. I also switched to dabs instead of blowing thru an oz every month which ultimately wasn’t even helping the pain all that much. 

With the dabs look into live resins I noticed that stuff that was BHO or distillate would make my lungs feel like I’m trying to breathe thru the mud. 

Ultimately I’d chose coughing every day for the rest of my life if it means I take back some of my day as a functional adult. I understand that being in pain to the point where you can’t get up and care for yourself is worse than struggling to breathe while doing those things. 

What I’ve found to help so far is actually trying to really *barely* use my Ventolin (less than 2x a week) because I found the more I use it I build a tolerance to it (Eds) and it doesn’t help as much/ last as long. Also to only take dabs when I can’t take the pain anymore so that I give my lungs a little break in between (ex. Trying to not dab in the middle of the night unless I truly cannot sleep thru it). 

The biggest thing that’s helped keep my lungs clear-er is actually believe it or not singing! I used to do swimming to strengthen them but pools are closed so as an at home pre-dab warm up I work on singing. Even just 10 minutes and my breathing is deeper and stronger. 30/40 minutes I literally don’t feel like I have the asthma it’s kinda crazy. 

After I’ve opened my lungs up a bit and coughed some stuff out I go onto part two where I take the dabs. I try and inhale as deeply as I can and then kinda strategically firm cough the phlegm out. The little heat and vapor kinda make it easier to get deeper in my airways and cough that lining out. Truly try to not cough unless it’s to get stuff out that’s where those headaches, feeling dizzy/weak comes from. Also be careful about coughing with your head below the rest of your body if you have POTS too (6 hour headache anyone?) AS a precaution you should always dab while sitting if you have POTS. Sorry for the book I hope that something in there works for you. I hope the weed continues to ease your pain and that your asthma takes a back seat so you can continue to be functional. Best of luck bendy friend"

Dermatillomania,foh2s85,t3_g7anmt,1587759874.0,"!!raw shea butter! Listen I’m sure all those other combinations are great but honestly whatever soap you’re using and liking that gets your face nice and clean with raw shea butter will heal and fade everything. Trust. I use Bronners or raw African black soap but I’ve used lots of different natural soaps all great goats milk, sea salt soaps, olive oil essential oil soaps truthfully as long as they get your skin clean and they don’t have additional drying ingredients you’re set. Raw shea butter is solid at room temp so you gotta get a chunk of it and warm it between the backs of your hands and apply I like to add hot water to the backs of my hands to get it to go on thinly and evenly. Will not clog your pores your skin will absorb it all and be very happy 6-10 hours later I notice a huge difference. 

edit- I order my shea butter from better shea butter so far 8 lbs in all quality so I do recommend but I’m sure as long as it’s raw and clean/fresh it’ll be great!"
COVID19,fog85uz,t1_fo9aqhm,1587749176.0,"That is definitely the question to be asking! I’ve been thinking the same thing for a while. So far it seems only a few hospitals are doing the transfusion but who knows maybe if you were admitted or a loved one was you could advocate for the use of this treatment. Searching local communities for recovered patients you could find a plasma match for the patient in needs blood type. I think if you really insisted and the hospital was maybe a teaching or research hospital and you brought in your own match, why wouldn’t they try it? 

In case anyone here is worried about how or where they could get this treatment I know Houston Methodist is doing it and if you did some digging there’s a hospital in NY too. UCDavis is hopefully going to start soon."
Visiblemending,foegixm,t3_g6x6is,1587703211.0,Thank you!!! I have been looking for a technique to use to mend some major sweater damage from my rabbits!
COVID19,fo96zqw,t1_fo95tbl,1587612006.0,Just hard to understand the direction of attention to a route that takes more time and will help a smaller grouping of people. The plasma transfusions can help everyone especially the critically ill. It works right now can start saving real lives today. And I’m not saying that people are too stupid to understand the risks I’m saying that the risks are literally unknown . As in no one truly knows but the only people who would have the best idea (hopefully?) would be those who formulated it. I don’t think human testing should be available at all without years of animal testing and adjustments. However if people are going to insist on human testing right away the only people who should have the option to go under that risk are those with the best amount of knowledge on the subject at hand. I’m not saying average joe is stupid I’m saying average joe isn’t an expert and therefore knows the absolute least about the unknowns.
COVID19,fo962gz,t1_fo95kro,1587611383.0,Okay wait right before the end of that you said the medical community has to come up with things in a hurried fashion. Absolutely! This is a viral pandemic. I do not want millions dead so this is the time to do what works and has worked in dire times of need of treatment since 1892. I do not support the timely route that will only help the few. Do what works to save time and save lives not chase a vaccine while infection rate rises and death toll rises daily.
COVID19,fo94c20,t1_fo90zgl,1587610241.0,You’re looking at options that put human lives at unknown risk. It really seems like you are comfortable with someone (not you) going into unknown risk including death as long as it means it could prevent the same for you and others like you. When effective options *already exist* and occur naturally. Please take a minute to think about these as lives and not as volunteer test subjects for the sake of options. Your comfortability should not mean more than the life and death of others. Reevaluate
COVID19,fo8yn8b,t1_fo8xv18,1587606629.0,Fantastic. So assuming you already know all about that why do you still support this course of action for a vaccine during an active pandemic? Vaccines are for those yet to be infected. Trying to understand this viewpoint
COVID19,fo8xokr,t1_fo8s87o,1587606031.0,"There is no option where you get to help save the planet that’s an emotionally persuasive argument based on nothingness. To combat this pandemic just like how we have since 1892 we should preform blood plasma transfusions from recovered COVID patients. This is all unnecessary and a waste of time, lives, and resources. I apologize for coming off as condescending not my intention I was trying to express the simplicity of one with the complexity of the other."
COVID19,fo8sz48,t1_fo8s87o,1587603203.0,The average joe is able to understand that bullets pierce holes in you and too many holes you die or holes in the wrong places immediate lights out. Or bomb goes boom we all die. Terrible but simple to understand. It’s not oh no why are my organs failing doctor? Why am I suddenly weak and suffering? Am I gonna die? What’s happening to me? - still not seeing how that’s a little different ?
COVID19,fo8rwwg,t1_fo85k23,1587602577.0,Very very different. The premise of this being unethical isn’t that you’re consenting to putting yourself in danger. It’s that the danger is truly unknown; even to those who helped create what you are going to have injected. The actual combination itself is unknown. How your body will react to it is unknown. How the vaccine will react to the virus is unknown. How all these experimental interactions going on (within a short period of time *and/or* longterm ) will affect your system is also unknown. Theres so many scientific variables that could have irreversible consequences that this should absolutely not be an option for the public to volunteer for. The only people who can even begin to understand the repercussions for this experiment are the scientists who create it.
COVID19,fo8qcnn,t1_fo885cd,1587601679.0,"This is a vaccine not a treatment. We have had “treatments” for viruses since 1892 called convalescent plasma. The principal is very simple: a recovered person has antibodies in the plasma of their blood. An infected person or someone who has not yet been infected does not have these antibodies. By preforming a plasma transfusion infected people in intensive care can begin to fight off the virus and for negative virus populous it can protect them from being infected. Convalescent plasma IS the preferred pandemic treatment because it can be made locally within infected communities with the recovered being able to provide a “cure” to the sick. Please do not be mislead into thinking this vaccine is what’s going to protect and save you. You and others are encouraging human being to risk it all for an experiment. When a treatment that works well enough to be a “cure” for most has existed for over 100 years!

Come on at some point if you’re scarred like this- okay let me back up *I do not understand* how you can’t see yourselves in this picture. It’s truly leaving me wondering where is your compassion and understanding for others who have gone thru the same traumatic experiences and healed. Do you people who feel this way not want to get to a point where you can just wear clothing and show skin because it’s just clothing and it’s just skin? If we have visible scars are we just supposed to cover ourselves at all times in public?? 

I’m just extremely disappointed. Like no matter what you get past those visible reminders will always catch peoples eyes before anything else. Like it’s something we can’t let go of and move on from. Dis-a-fucking-pointing."

relationships,fmmzqex,t1_fmmwe9x,1586215212.0,Honestly OP just realizing that because he does not live in your body and feel what your body feels: he will never truly understand. And that that’s okay. As long as you listen to your body and maybe your doctors (if they know you and know what they are talking about) and do as much as you can to keep strength in the  surrounding muscles of those unstable joints: You are doing everything in your power and with your knowledge to maintain wellness. Ignore him. Humor him. Do whatever you need to do to get by living with him. If you’re really sick of it and above it all you can say “I’m sorry you don’t understand but I’m thankful you don’t have to.” I feel that one quite a bit with people who throw around “advice”/ snarky comments. When you get the chance to be on your own or with someone who does their best to understand you you will reap the rewards of peace and satisfaction in knowing that you were able to let go of all the frustration while being young and stuck in a shitty living situation with unhealthy people. Best of luck. Keep your head up as much as you can. Listen to your body not your dumb dad.

Also just personally so far your mods have a very clean look to them (super symmetrical and nice central location) and I feel like a tongue split will just take attention away from that look. Ear stretching you have the option to hide it with your hair and I feel like you’d rock plugs or tunnels made with natural materials or even eventually brass jewelry ? Just my two cents

Stretched,fhip9qp,t3_f3aax1,1581629163.0,If you check my comment history I’ve shared a bit abt going from 2g to 0g again so if you want all that info ^^  but yes I do like the idea of adding some weight with hoops thru some stone tunnels when you can fit double flare. Definitely worth it for the bigger jumps. I recommend trying single flare stone/glass size to double flare of that size then size up to next size up single flare. That pattern has just worked super well for me just waiting til the double flares can easily slip thru before going up to the next size kinda works like half steps yk. Anyways make sure you’re using a good thick oil/butter for them too so you can keep the whole area nice and moisturized so they can heal well. I use raw shea butter but as long as it’s a thicker natural oil/ butter that your skin likes go for it. Best of luck girly your ears are lookin great!
bodymods,fhinzcd,t3_f361l2,1581628456.0,Can you share the info or name of who did this for you? I love the saturation and color choices

BadChoicesGoodStories,fhep97p,t1_fhe4ct8,1581527099.0,Hey just because you haven’t seen the evidence doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. There is footage of this happening but the general takeaway of these videos is that: sick people don’t think clearly. Has absolutely nothing to do with Chinese social practices. I think the videos are posted on r/coronavirus

BPD,fhe33dg,t1_fhdniwm,1581512233.0,I’m gonna share that one with my boyfriend thank you
BPD,fhdndln,t1_fhdn7fn,1581492591.0,I have one friend who has it but it’s definitely different for her. We talked for a while and found some common ground tho joked for a bit about how crazy we both are. I think I love her wow
BPD,fhdmxqg,t1_fhdmssa,1581492079.0,Honestly yea I don’t think I can tell anyone. It doesn’t feel like depression where people understand for me it’s more of the defensive paranoia side where I want to like preserve this image of sane and normal. This diagnosis makes me kind of uncomfortable because I feel very exposed.
BPD,fhdmjgs,t1_fhdm6zf,1581491630.0,Thank you I’m kind of relieved but the idea of anyone who isnt my boyfriend or my one friend knowing makes me feel very anxious. I feel like if anyone knows what it is they can look it up and know how I’m thinking ?? Super weird

Stretched,fgzex1q,t3_ez7ew2,1581193518.0,"Honestly dude this sounds like a terrible idea. You ofc can do whatever you want but from a healing POV you’re more likely to be left with inflamed, irritated ears healing, left with less lobe, and potentially more scar tissue (which you don’t want) Thats actually why most of the time  scalpeling is done: to get rid of excess scar tissue. Those small jumps may seem tedious but honestly you can get to 2g in maybe 3 1/2 months with much better results. Taking the short cut with stretching is ill-advised for a reason. This is supposed to be natural process of slowly adding weight + girth to a piercing to allow the skin to *adjust* and thicken up before adding more 
I hope you reconsider taking it slow"
Stretched,fgx1z6m,t1_fgx1mn4,1581168237.0,Plugs or tunnels! I think plugs would be a little faster because more stone = more weight but I’m just trying it with tunnels this time because I’m not in a rush to size back up
Stretched,fgx18vn,t1_fgwy9he,1581168021.0,Also maybe shipping to Africa wouldn’t be that bad from a UK based place ? just an idea
Stretched,fgx0caq,t1_fgwy9he,1581167823.0,Best of luck it’s better to wait it out even though ugh I know! so close!!
Stretched,fgx00tp,t1_fgwy9he,1581167741.0,Hey it’s worked for me and I’m sure it’s gonna work again. You totally don’t need 1g don’t worry. 2g double flares to 0g singles is the way. Jump is so much smaller and if I knew how to upload from mobile I’d attach comparison pictures of the plugs so you can see for yourself. I actually think the 2g doubles at the flares are a 1g size so -stay with me here- if you can get them to smoothly slide through the flares then you’re ready for that last mm or less to 0g.
Stretched,fgwynio,t3_ezm0y3,1581167351.0,Do you have shea butter or some kind of thicker oil your skin likes ? It looks dry and like it needs some time to heal up. Moisturizing helps a lot with the healing process. Make sure you wash your hands throughly before touching your ears and wash them too (gently) with warm soapy water. Get a pea sized amount of some natural butter and you massage that into your lobes. After that don’t touch them do homework or sleep they should be better within 2/3 days if you do this cleaning+ moisturizing routine daily
