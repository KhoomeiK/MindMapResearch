That is a comment you left me, but obviously you deleted it. I'm just going to leave it here so people can see that you are a misogynist. As soon as a woman says she doesn't think you are attractive, you get all defensive and you attack WOMEN IN GENERAL (and I got that off the ""crawl back into you feminist TROLL PIT"" part of your comment). 
 
Now I dont care whether you report my comment or not, it's not like I said something you didnt ask for (by that I mean my opinion and like you said, you came here for people to comment on you LOOKS(!!) which is what I did in my original comment).

>NOBODY asked you for your subjective and completely wrong opinion of what you perceive my character
