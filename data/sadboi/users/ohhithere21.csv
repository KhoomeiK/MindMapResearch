Instagramreality,f8ivi27,t1_f8gyfal,1574593157.0,"It‚Äôs more showing that every woman‚Äôs body looks like the left in normal lighting etc and that we see good posing and lighting. She looks amazing in both, just a reminder that we do look like that usually."
Instagramreality,f8ivdyg,t1_f8hmyuk,1574593111.0,To remind woman who look like the left photo that every woman does look like this without good posing or lighting. It‚Äôs uplifting. She still looks fab in both
Instagramreality,f8iv8jj,t1_f8h4usk,1574593047.0,"Absolutely, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs edited (although I do think it‚Äôs been tweaked a little) I‚Äôm showing the difference posing and lighting can make. Most of us look like the first photo and feel bad for it, but even the sexiest girls on Instagram look that way in real life. It‚Äôs reassuring. She‚Äôs still beautiful in both"

Advice,f1ffbzb,t1_f1f6bld,1569443280.0,"I guess, when I was renting I felt instantly comfortable and settled immediately. Maybe I thought this would feel different. 

I think I settled on the location, I love the house just not the street or area. The commute to work is much more difficult as well."

I clenched my fist reallyyyy tight, then concentrate on my fist, acknowledging all the tension. Then the tension from the rest of my body kind of relaxes as it‚Äôs all focused on my fist. Then I can sort of talk myself round and think more rationally."

BPD,evuicea,t3_clcvls,1564796094.0,"Soooo common to feel that way! Try to mentalise... he probably is just feeling unwell or tired or perhaps he just didn‚Äôt feel up to going.
