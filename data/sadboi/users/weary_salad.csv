psychology,fn3obwh,t3_fyyrox,1586624723.0,"I have anxiety and I'm taking medication. Even though, there are days that I feel awfully anxious. I feel like I might get worst if I don't take care of my health (journaling, meditation,  exercising at home, having a healthy sleeping schedule..etc). Sometimes my head feels fuzzy when I let my anxiety take over and spend more than 30 minutes ruminating. It's strange but I've started to see this as my new [normal] life and perhaps, this is what's helping me coping with all of this. Sometimes I think I'm adapting and learning to live with the virus. I'm currently having online classes and I already seem to have adapted.
While I felt isolated during the 2 first weeks and I did interact more frequently online (which is something that I barely do), I find myself more at ""ease"" now. Yes I do feel scared that my loved ones might catch the decease  but somehow I don't feel panic. 

I can't understand if this is a good thing or not. 

I'm pretty sure that cases of anxiety and depression will rise alot though. 

English is not my main language so please, excuse me."

offmychest,flqltgc,t3_fqa0ka,1585399487.0,"Yes and I do agree with you. It pisses me off. My parents still have to go to work because they can't afford to stay home. I can't work because of my scholarship, as my tutors wont allow it. I wish I could somehow help them in this situation. And what angers me the most is seeing this celebrities having such a big crowd. Like stop. You definitely can afford to stay home with your family but many of us can't."

Anxiety,f7c3gco,t3_dv3h9d,1573583565.0,"I barely slept this night, because I was imagining all the hipotetic scenarios I could. I have a lot of pain on my back, arms and wrists because I went thru the whole day of classes without resting, eating properly and only drinking coffee. Till this day I couldn't accept that my anxiety might also affect my body. Reading this has made me reflect upon that. Thank you."

Anxiety,f2n0i90,t3_ddtfm1,1570310436.0,"I usually try to meditate when I'm most anxious. Writting my thoughts on my journal also helps to let go. Reading or playing video games helps me leave the ""real"" world even if it's for a few minutes. Hang in there and best to you."

Thank you for your advice."
