And all is well, yesterday was rough and didn't feel the best but I'm pretty sure that's pretty much I feel starting a complete fast without medication as well. One more complete day to go without water and actually fantastic a lot better than fasts in the past, feeling fully awake and clear-headed. So maybe the medication is helping a little bit with that. I'm just hoping my blood levels of the medication won't spike at any time during the fast because of the rate at which it breaks down slows during a fast. Also, the digestive system shuts off in about three days after a fast, hoping all the medication that has been in my digestive system for a week won't activate all it won't at that end of my fast. I don't think that'll happen but if anyone with more experience and knowledge on that input would be very helpful. I looked into some research on that matter and researchers have just begun work into fasting and medication in 2017 and just got published in 2019, and the longest fast they did was 36 hours with water and no food. So I'm kinda going to uncharted waters here research-wise, hopefully, all goes well."

I‚Äôll give the fasting a shot and see what happens, worse comes to worse I just end the fast and eat something. No water fasts might not be possible anymore though sadly. I‚Äôll try but it just sounds like a bad time of heartburn and such. No water fasting before meds was totally amazing, and such a good way to kick off a no food fast too.
