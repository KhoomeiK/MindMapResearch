AskReddit,foz6d6a,t3_ga4gjx,1588185435.0,"I started reading these and I remembered one.

A couple of years ago I was dating a guy who lived two towns over, and because of his schedule I would go over in the evening or leave late at night to head home.

It was the middle of summer and I was on the highway to visit him when what I assumed was an unmarked police car pull up next to mine. Keep in mind this was around 2 in the morning and there was a handful of other cars on the road but nothing out of the ordinary.

I was going 120 in the fast lane and I thought maybe he was going to pull me over for going too fast (max 100 here) but it wasn’t uncommon for people to go 120 on this stretch of highway. 

This is the part where I started to get freaked out a little (since at the time I was in my early twenties and I’m a woman). I had assumed it was an unmarked police car because it had that stupidly long radio antenna that gives them away even when they’re unmarked; but then the person lit up a spotlight on my car- blinding me and almost causing me to swerve. I had slowed down to 100 because I assumed he was going to pull me over.

Then he just paced alongside me with the spotlight on while I keep glancing over trying to signal to him to see what he wants. This went on for about 5 minutes before the light went off and then they sped up past me and immediately took the next ramp off the highway. 

Nothing ever came of it,  but I still don’t understand why they did that to me in the first place. I have a hard enough time driving at night to begin with never mind with someone blinding me with a 1000 watt spotlight on the highway. 

If it was a cop- they’re an asshole and I’m pretty sure that was illegal but logic makes me want to justify it as they were looking for someone who just so happened to drive the same model of car as me but it was weird either way."

That and the other thing is try to find something you can hyper focus on instead of your thoughts. As well, make sure you’re eating and drinking. Even if all you can stomach is some soup or crackers that’s enough to make you feel a little better. 

I always sit there when I’m where you are thinking nothing will take me out of it and then I try these things and I feel a little less crying and crunchy

As for your parents I’m going to sound blunt and maybe a bit rude but i was one who constantly expected my family to smell that I was upset about something because to me I was being really obvious.

You would be shocked how lost in their own heads people get and that they won’t notice you exist until you remind them.

My family has never been affectionate and I grew up as a very emotional child. I spent a lot of time being angry at them for not helping me or checking I was okay. Now that I’m older I will just look at my mother and tell her I’m having a really bad day and I’d like to talk about it

You own a microwave I assume?

You sit there saying he works all week and you’ve been laid off. All he’s asked of you at this time while he doesn’t have a choice and has to continue working- is that you throw some fucking food together for him while he pays for your existence rn. 

You’re a brat is what it is. You’re used to not cooking and picking up take away and you probably don’t enjoy cooking by the sounds of it. The dude works all day and you say he’s entitled  for wanting food after working a physically demanding job; and yet the first thing you want him to do is drop everything and provide you with attention because YOURE bored and incapable of entertaining yourself now that you’re in quarantine. 

The fact that you have the absolute balls to say he’s the problem here is outstanding- because it’s obvious he has a thing for high maintenance women who are embarrassingly dependant for basic shit like idk, not being able to let him unwind and have something to eat before demanding his direct attention to talk about yourself some more. It’s painfully clear who you care the most about in your relationship. 

Show that you appreciate him working rn and make the man some fucking dinner, or go get yourself an “essential” job and continue being a lazy asshole and wasting your money on takeaway.

YTA and you’re a needy fucking child with a mountain of excuses as to why you can’t spend a whole hour tops out of your day to make the dude providing for you some damn food after working.

Until the Bud Light/Bud Lite flip

There was a span of about six months where Bud Light was Bud Lite for me. I would argue with my mother that it had changed and both her and my brother were telling me it has always been Lite just like Miller Lite. 

My roommate and I went to the beer store to pick up a couple of cases for a trip to the cottage and while we were there I kept pointing at the skid of Bud Lite saying how wrong it looked to me. 

He would roll his eyes at me, until a week later when I was on the google and realized it was back to being Bud Light. I immediately sent him the logopedia and how it was never Bud Lite like I was just bugging him about at the store. 

He freaked out a little, and even when I brought it up to my mom after it flipped back- the first thing she did was roll her eyes and immediately restate that it was always Lite and why I was bringing it up again.

I told her it’s not Lite, and it’s back to being Light.

She googled it and then said she must’ve been remembering Miller Lite

BPD4BPD,fn63dz3,t1_fn3q7p5,1586685838.0,"Have you considered that maybe what you’re feeling is genuine love for this person? 

From my experience, because of my childhood and the traumas- I find it hard to connect with people on a social level, and I have trouble telling the difference in how I’m supposed to feel towards them. Our illness prevents us from being able to understand “normal” human interactions, and by proxy- how healthy relationships are supposed to work. 

For the longest time my FP was the gay friend I mentioned before. I had a massive crush on him for a good four or so years. Now that I’m older I understand that because my own siblings and I have had such rocky relationships because of our parents and how we were brought up in a toxic household. 

I understand now that the entire time what I had interpreted as romantic love was actually just loving him like I would love my actual brothers had we had a healthy relationship growing up. I love him more than a friend, and I know that if we were to date then it wouldn’t feel right either because he’s gay and I’m biologically a woman and neither of us would be happy in the long run aside from the companionship.

From what you’ve written it feels to me that you crave the companionship and the feelings you get from your FP- but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re romantically attracted to them. If you feel like you want to spend all your time with her, and the only way you feel you can express the love for her that you’re feeling is by being sexual or romantic (because that’s also our illness right)- then it’s more of a “finding a way to express your love towards her without it taking away from who you are” issue.

How I dealt with it was taking a step back and looking at the situation from a “in five years” perspective and how I would feel if I chose to Go through with what my brain thought I wanted.

In the long run I knew that the only way to keep him in my life was to be platonically friends with him. Since then my crush has gone away, but we’re still super close. We worked together and people thought we were dating LOL 

 But we still hug and cuddle each other and we take comfort in each other’s companionship because neither of us had close family relationships growing up. It was the comfort and security of knowing that I could still express how much I loved him without making him uncomfortable or losing myself in the process. That I have someone that in 20 years- will still be in my life and loving me as much as the day we met. 

He is my family 

He’s more than my friend and he is very special to me

I’m not sure if this helps in any way- but It’s no problem"
BPD4BPD,fn34ro3,t3_fyz0wu,1586612819.0,"It is completely alright to have a different romantic orientation to your sexual orientation.

My bestfriend is a gay man, but he is biromantic as well. He emotionally connects with women better than he does men- but he’s only sexually attracted to men.

That being said I also know that our disorder tends to put people who objectively treat us well immediately into the romantic spot in our brains.

I know I always end up with crushes on friends just because they genuinely like me and my brain doesn’t know how to understand that.

Your identity is fluid and can change as you get older, understand that you may fall for someone just based on how well you click with them. You can love someone a lot and it doesn’t have to tie sexual or romantic. Just affectionate platonic love for someone you consider dear

It’s tricky with a FP cause you idealize them and when I do that I confuse it with being attracted to them. Sometimes when I end up convincing someone to like me back- i find out it was just the thrill of someone wanting me that I liked

I hope this helps somehow!"

1: my father slipped a disk out in his back a couple of times while I was growing up. He would usually end up on the floor on his side and he wouldnt be able to move at all without screaming in pain. It would usually last about two weeks at a time because there was nothing medics could do for him apparently. Nothing quite like being woken up multiple times throughout the night for weeks to your father screaming in agony. 

2. I was young and inexperienced with introducing animals together. I made the mistake of introducing two baby rats to one of my older female rats who had lost her cage mates. I had introduced rats together before, but apparently the last older female I had took to the babies much better than my current female. I can still hear the sound of her crunching the neck of one of the babies, and it screaming and choking on its own blood. The other baby was fine, and eventually we got her another cage mate- but that older female remained a solitary rat for the rest of her life.

3. I understand the death rattle reference others have been commenting about- but Ive only experienced it with our 18 year old terrier mix. We lost him just before christmas last year- but he was in heart failure for about a week before his lungs finally filled up and he passed.
