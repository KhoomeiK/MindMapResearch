AlAnon,fphumj5,t3_gdigh0,1588628105.0,"Wow! My Q has gaslit me many times to protect his drinking but this sounds like some fuckery on a whole new level. Have you ever watched Shameless? If so, this sounds like a total Frank move! 

Looking back at when my Q was at his worst, I accepted his twisted reality much too easily. I, too, let my Q make me feel like I was insane and overreacting. Having friends and family was so important for me to stay in the real world and out of his fantasy alcoholic one. 

I just wanted to comment to echo what everyone else is saying and hoping that maybe it helps. You are NOT crazy and even if you needed professional help, he is in no condition to diagnose or ""help"" anyone."

AlAnon,fk2ubsf,t1_fk2i1d5,1583809358.0,"When my Q was at his worst, I could have been the spitting image of perfection but he'd have still been able to come up with something to criticize. Anything to keep the attention off his problem. I never thought I'd have to fight with someone over what's real and what's not- and often lose! My Q trusted me the most and therefore only showed me his most ugly side. We are worth so much more than that."
AlAnon,fk2g5je,t3_fg44oi,1583800314.0,"I'm reading so many parallels to my husband and Q. The continuing to drink at night after we got home from anywhere with alcohol. He's also super fit and eats healthy. He used this against me. Although I'm at a normal weight and have no health problems, I'm not really into working out or eating salads. 

Whenever I brought up his drinking, he would call me unhealthy and say that my ""problem"" was much more serious than his drinking. He gaslit me for a good few years into believieng his behavior was normal while I felt I needed to apologize for eating french fries like omce a month (to the point where I'd only eat in secret).

 I wish I would have listened to my gut instead of my Q from the begining. You are not over reacting. You are a competent adult and a great judge of what's normal and not."

Not drinking while using it is such a minute expectation to meet. Don't let him guilt you into it. We are often gaslit by alcoholics to make it seem like their behavior is normal and we are overreacting. As someone who has a million times, don't fall for it! Whether you plan to stay in this relationship short or long term, you absolutely have to establish and stick to your boundaries."
