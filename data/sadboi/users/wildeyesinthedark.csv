Have you considered his table-flipping probably has nothing to do with you? It seems like he came home upset so this is not about you. Some people need time to think before they can talk out loud about things that bother them or after trauma."

needadvice,f24v227,t3_dbm9k6,1569960837.0,"Hey! Fellow nut case here (this is a joke). I had a brain injury from a car accident and have pts from the trama. I had no idea for a few years and am only now starting to realize my triggers and how to find balance. Or figure out what is ""normal"" or how I want to react. I also feel like a cold broken person, I would love help and support but can't seem to figure out how to get it. I want human connection but still with boundaries because I can get very panicked without wanting to or meaning to. I think the best thing I have found is to be as open about how you are feeling as possible. This is always 100% terrifying, I feel ""to much"" or very needy, or like a fool for being nervous in the first place. It is always better to talk and go thought that emotion then be silent. I have found most people will care and try to support you. Most people are so gratful you trusted them enough to tell them how you feel. There are absolutely people who may not, and that is ok. Not everyone can be there in the way you need it. However the more open you are the more the people who will help sick by you and the others maybe take a break from your world. This is a good thing in the long run. Alos for me taking time to retrace my steps to see why I was triggered or understand my feelings has been the best help. Hope this helps, good luck on your journey."
