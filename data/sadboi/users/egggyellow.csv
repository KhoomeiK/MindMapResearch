Anxiety,f01r2v9,t1_f01g2gc,1568317973.0,"I used to drink coffee every day. Still love it, but I do avoid it now when my anxiety is bad. It could be a mix of the caffeine/ acidity/ first thing in the morning thing."

Anxiety,ez6bfv3,t1_ez1fbt1,1567710856.0,"This stuff seems totally unrelated to GI health, but since stress was a trigger, I tried to treat my stress primarily. And I didn’t make one big change so much as I made a ton of small changes. I pinpointed every thing that was possibly be causing me stress and eliminated it or adjusted my own routines to prevent stress affecting me. I was in college and in a stressful on campus position- so I left it and avoided the people that were the cause of that stress. I totally revamped my living spaces - soft lights, aromatherapy, plants. Minimized my wardrobe. Practiced mindfulness and meditation. Sounds corny, I know, but I never realized how tense I was - mentally and physically - and when I took a step back and examined the whole of my life, I was able to change how things in my life affected me. I’m so much more emotionally mature, which, seems fun to say helped regulate my digestive system. 

As for changes surrounding food and health, top of the list is change your diet and add more exercise. Way easier said than done. I haven’t eliminated anything, but I make sure my diet is balanced and I get enough fiber to aid digestion. Different food and health changes affect everyone differently- try anything and everything.

Like I said, lots of little changes. I haven’t had a bad stomach/anxiety episode in over a year."
Anxiety,ez0qkgy,t3_czqtqt,1567640547.0,"It took my five years to realize my GI issues were anxiety and stress related. 

I would get these totally incapacitating, debilitating stomach aches that I could only describe as indigestion or gas in my upper gi tract. I would sometimes vomit every 20 minute for a day or two at a time. I was afraid of eating out and packed “safe” foods everywhere. And the very first time I went to a gi doctor and told her all my symptoms and how it was never related to certain foods, she said, “it must be stress”

Mind blown. Been able to wipe out my GI issues the past year. Life has never been better."

eczema,ey797oz,t3_cvswa3,1566875389.0,"I actually love looking at people look at my splotches. You start to notice who’s grossed out and who couldn’t care less. Im not about to cover up, potentially overheat, and further irritate my skin for others’ social comfort. A general rule I follow is if you notice something that someone can’t fix in 10 seconds, don’t point it out. But I do love when people point out how great my skin is, when it is! It reinforces the good self care habits. More people should be giving genuine compliments, instead of thinly veiled pity."

Anxiety,ey66lro,t3_cvsi3r,1566848596.0,"Yes! I thought it was just me. After a night out, it feels like whatever is making my anxiety go, just shuts off. It literally feels like my anxiety is a buzzing, background noise that has been shut off, like how you notice how quiet a room is after turning off the fan. Alas, I have no idea why."
Anxiety,ey4k0vo,t3_cviuqq,1566795063.0,"I’m out of school but I’m looking to go to grad school and I fear this very thing. So much of the anxiety around it is even messing with my admissions process and I’m not even in a program yet lol. But it sounds like you just need to remember why did you this in the first place. Plenty of people go thru the grind that you’re now finding yourself, and your anxiety is just a little extra roadblock to achieving your goals.  A lot of your anxiety also seems to be stemming from your scheduling. Assuming you’ve got syllabi that list every assignment and exam for each class - Front loading some work and taking time to plan out your days, weeks, and assignments can work wonders in relieving some of that ever-present fear of falling behind. If you’ve got your entire semester planned out in a big calendar right in front of you, it’ll help you understand how to prioritize your time day to day, it’ll help keep you on track and make sure you’re getting things done, and even allow you to see in your schedule if/when you need some help balancing it all out. I.E. if you’ve got 3 assignments due in one week, maybe ask for some coverage at work so you can focus. Of course your mental health takes top priority! Higher education is an investment in yourself and your future, and it should be challenging, but not insanely difficult. If you’ve gone through a semester, done absolutely everything you can to set yourself up for success, and still find yourself drowning in this anxiety and stress, absolutely take some time off and reevaluate your situation."

eczema,ex3vc0g,t3_crbfma,1565992332.0,"Hey! I’ve recently dealt with this. Something I found helped was sunscreen and an astringent/ toner, every day. I know that alcohol is generally avoided on eczema prone skin, but it does help even skin tone. Keeping the area as moisturized as possible is also a MUST. I keep three lip balms on me at all times to make sure ahahhaha. At night, to help with the itchy redness, I take a Benadryl and apply a lighter cream, ointment or lip balm, and a face oil like argan oil. I usually wake up and the skin is clearer and not red. This helped me heal the skin and even the color eventually. Full disclosure, do a patch test before you try out any facial oils like tea tree or argan. Hope this helps"
eczema,ewosdwb,t3_cpd3m4,1565625586.0,"Not sure how big yours is going to be or where on your body, but make sure to follow all your shop’s instructions and buy the creams and soaps they advise to take care of it. This is the biggest thing you could do to prevent messing with the healing skin and ink. I tried to avoid my regular lotions until it was fully healed but I might be overly cautious. And yes, if it’s itchy(and not the usual eczema itch, if you can tell the difference) that means it’s healing! Ive a small < 6cm tattoo on my back, right below my neck, where my neck eczema can sometimes spread. More people need to talk about eczema and tattoos! Just because you have eczema doesn’t rule them out. Hope it goes well and you love your new ink OP"
eczema,ewicq4m,t3_cofibs,1565445931.0,"Lighter lotions like aveeno, cerave, and cetaphil mentioned already should help! Cerave also has an ointment with less percentage of petrolatum, which is the ingredient that feels “greasy”. When my skin absolutely refuses to stop flaking, I usually lather the flaky parts overnight in a combo of ointments and facial oils like vitamin e and argan oil. If you do choose to try out some facial oils, definitely do a spot test to make sure you won’t trigger any more eczema (I found out I was allergic to tea tree oil the hard way). And put them on in order from thinnest to heaviest, oils last!"
eczema,ewha0sj,t3_coaw3p,1565402002.0,"Didn’t realize nickel was in some foods! It could just be a random allergy/ trigger. I found out after a grueling flare up and an allergy test that I was allergic to zinc; which is in the bacitracin I was using to treat said flare up. I don’t know anyone else allergic to it. It’s cool that you’ve been able to single out nickel as a potential trigger, though."
eczema,ew18u24,t3_cm9yzy,1565017930.0,"Yes yes yes to the point about working out. I always noticed my skin is much more tame for a few days after working out. It could be that I’ve upped my water intake in the past year since starting regular exercise, or that exercise just reinvigorates skins’s normal processes like you said. I do find that switching between, and not actually stopping, creams works for me. If I use up a bottle of aveeno, for ex, I would switch to a cetaphil or cerave right after. This usually helps keep me from flaring up."
eczema,evxl0yh,t3_clq4x2,1564896235.0,"I just discovered that cerave makes an OINTMENT. Total game changer for me. It has hyaluronic acid as well as petrolatum, the main ingredient in aquaphor and Vaseline. It’s also much easier to rub into the skin. I’ve always been a fan of heavier ointments when my skin is dry because creams tend to sting, and never seem to do a good enough moisturizing job for me."
eczema,evxjpu1,t3_clilst,1564894850.0,"Hahaha I was the total opposite. I owned no T-shirt’s with sleeves past my elbows until I turned 20, when my eczema became much more manageable. To this day I would much prefer a layer if I’m cold and a short sleeve top- just the /thought/ fabric on my elbows makes me itchy sometimes!"

eczema,evskctq,t3_cl0li4,1564749106.0,"Both my brother and I can have bad flare ups on our faces and necks at times and we are constantly keeping track of our allergy triggers so as to keep our skin in check. I can’t speak for dating with eczema as I’ve been with my partner for 7yrs. But my brother has had rough patches on his arms and face for the past couple years, including the time  he met his current girlfriend. When I first met her at a family dinner I noticed that she already knew all his major food allergies and triggers, and even how he would react to certain food. My partner has seen the worst and best of my skin and still makes me feel beautiful, is always stopping me from scratching, and always making sure I don’t eat anything I’m allergic to even when I want to (peanut butter lol).  People you date should not only empathize w your skin struggles but also care about you enough to care about your eczema too!!! Whether you like it or not, you and your skin are a package deal. If someone’s making you feel ashamed or uncomfortable for it, know you don’t deserve that, ever. Hope this empowers you just a tad OP! Good luck out there"
