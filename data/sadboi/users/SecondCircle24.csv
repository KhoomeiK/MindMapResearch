unpopularopinion,fep0e0m,t1_fenm02m,1579309334.0,"Which, to me, this embodies the kind of irony in ""Entitlement"" that gets thrown around constantly. When, rather politically speaking, they're really saying they deserve to spend money bombing children instead of feeding them or providing fucking shelter to the millions of people who didn't ask to be here and have never been treated like they even deserve to be alive (for whatever reasons that likely stemmed from issues beyond their control or abilties to deal with).

Yes, people are ""entitled"" to basic human rights and, to the systematic humdrum society's dismay, yes the right the pursue your happiness (obviously within some reason, by whatever structure).

Specifically pertaining to the post, if the only thing a person gets to enjoy all day is a fucking beer or two, knowing they won't eat or be warm or likely even be treated with respect that day (with no chance in hell they're signing for an apartment, going on a nice vacation, celebrating their birthday, or going somewhere to pick up their favorite dessert THAT YEAR)...I mean, really people? The mental gymnastics these people do to avoid the subject of genuine human to human empathy and of equal human rights amaze me, and that is coming from someone that genuinely, medically suffers from delusions during my worst episodes."
BipolarReddit,fcnnqr3,t3_ei1p3r,1577814974.0,"I have bipolar 2. I have never been prescribed Seroquel, but I was on Lexapro with Abilify, as well as Marlissa birth control. So I imagine I was affected very differently and won't speak much.

I will only say to watch out for a dip in your sex drive and the fact that you may want to wake up and immediately be active at 7 in the morning. Lexapro ultimately did not work for me in my experience, but there were several contributing factors as to why, including being combined with the Abilify and my work environment. 

Best of luck!"
relationship_advice,fb682ml,t3_ebgqpf,1576543725.0,"I know there are plenty of advice here, but I'll throw my experience in, and my apologies for formatting. 
My mom was your fiance. She suckered my poor dad into it somehow. I was born, and my parents stayed together for 21.5 years when it was all said and done.
I am diagnosed with Complex PTSD from being raised by that woman. Long story short, she continued to cheat and ruined my dad's life ultimately by stealing all his money and running off with gross men she found online and abusing every child she had along the way because of her selfish insanity.
However, my father in your shoes, with no blood relation to me, had adopted me and has loved me more than anyone in my life. I still have my adoptive father, and neither of my biological parents. But for the sacrifices he made just so I had as decent of a life I did, I would give my life any moment of any day. 
I'm sorry for all your pain in all of this. You and that innocent child who never asked to be part of any of this to begin with don't deserve it. She should have aborted and left. Anyone willing to get pregnant and have a child with some random and stick you in this situation is not worth your time, and most of all she isn't worthy of being of a mother, but society isn't ready for that talk yet."

EntitledPeople,f7vffus,t1_f7v7es2,1574023266.0," My point is tipping in our current system is required; we can hate and complain all we want, but we must also acknowledge the reality of the situation as it stands until whatever ideal solution is met to no longer require tipping.

You're still just further justifying and contributing to the idea that people DESERVE LESS (despite performing a service you did not ~need~).
Yes, the entire system is wrong to begin with and we should be petitioning our elected leaders to change these practices, but in the meantime the almost homeless,  very hungry, struggling-to-pay-their-bills server is going to get a fucking tip. It's the goddamn human thing to do. Or don't eat out.

Obviously, if the service was performed by someone who could have just as easily stabbed your eye as spit in your food, you have every reason to not tip but you damn well better be letting their manager know if their behavior was such a problem."

Yay for ""living for the experience!"" - if you actually bounce out like the 27 club. Not so much for trying to stabilize and maintain in the longterm and actually experience life, whatever the fuck that is actually supposed to be mean anyway.

Still hoping it's like a boomarang, but so far it's more a deflated ball covered in dust and cobwebs in the back of an old unused gym. Personally excited to fall back into space dust and give it another go in some form eventually ðŸ¤£ But some people figure it out. 

It's all a bullshit delusional trap in the end for what it's worth anyway - ran by paper and human toxicity. The people who ""do it right"" live the worst or most boring existences imaginable, tangled in man made red tape only to drown in financially-centric or socially-influenced decision cycles. 

Time to just mend the energy til ""reboot""."
