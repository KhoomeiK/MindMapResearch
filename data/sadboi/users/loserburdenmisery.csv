SuicideWatch,f2tiw28,t1_f2tg7ul,1570395927.0,I've already exhausted all my options. Tried therapy and different medications and nothing worked. My mother's going to die of cancer soon anyway and I'll be homeless. Better I kill myself before things go that far.
AskReddit,f0lonop,t3_d5bek2,1568725376.0,They didn't. I was formerly suicidal and still suicidal.
SuicideWatch,f0kc9mr,t1_f0kc7dk,1568675865.0,Shotgun sounds extremely painful
SuicideWatch,f0kbx8j,t1_f0kbr1v,1568675599.0,I don't expect it to be completely without pain. Some methods are a lot less painful than others though. An ideal method would be a good concoction of drugs that could kill me after making me unconscious.
SuicideWatch,f0jt7wi,t3_d51txu,1568662481.0,Same. The only reason I smoke is because I'm trying to give myself cancer. It would be a blessing.
SuicideWatch,ezxivww,t1_ezwb01e,1568241591.0,"I recently blew 20k that I received from my grandads inheritance on vacations. Pretty dumb because I can't drive, have no home of my own, no money and work only 30 hours a week on minimum wage. When my mum dies I'm fucked. She also has terminal cancer."
SuicideWatch,ezvuc2k,t1_ezvhti8,1568197417.0,Same thing as Monday.
SuicideWatch,ezsnxyo,t1_ezsnebw,1568099826.0,Some shithole in England.

SuicideWatch,ezriw28,t1_ezriptw,1568074534.0,I don't even know what my favourite thing was. I used to like playing video games but I don't enjoy them anymore.
SuicideWatch,ezrifgx,t1_ezrg8s3,1568074351.0,Things that I get no enjoyment from anymore.
SuicideWatch,ezr3nzu,t1_ezr3iog,1568068062.0,Nothing really. Everything becomes tedious and less enjoyable as I age.
SuicideWatch,ezr22rt,t1_ezquhly,1568067209.0,"Literally nothing enjoyable happened today. I got up feeling exhausted and walked all day for shit pay in the rain with wet socks, feeling depressed as fuck until I came home and collapsed from exhaustion. From my 15 years experience in this job, the rest of the week is more of the same."
SuicideWatch,ezoc8oj,t1_ezlorzg,1568020121.0,Good luck getting the right treatment in the UK for severe depression.
SuicideWatch,ezlork0,t3_d1dbib,1567979458.0,I think it should be legal to get euthanized for severe depression here. The support for people with mental health issues is a joke.
SuicideWatch,ezdng9e,t1_ezbfpsu,1567852502.0,No thanks.
SuicideWatch,ez7csyq,t1_ez7cfnl,1567721870.0,To collect money.
SuicideWatch,ez7ay3v,t1_ez7arb0,1567721178.0,"Probably not. It would also require an immense amount of hard work over years, doing things I aren't interested in to make it a possibility."
SuicideWatch,ez79898,t1_ez793b7,1567720561.0,No money to do it and no girl
SuicideWatch,ez77l9p,t1_ez77fxf,1567719934.0,There isn't anything I can think of that would make it worth living.
SuicideWatch,ez75zm0,t1_ez75rqa,1567719345.0,I'm not fine with trying or living that way. That's why I'm planning suicide. It's a lot easier.
SuicideWatch,ez744hl,t1_ez71zpj,1567718671.0,"Because there are 0 amount of girls that like 32 year old men who collect shopping trolleys at a supermarket for work, have no money, cant drive, live with their mother, have no ambition etc. I don't have the motivation to change that and there are things I can't change (like my small penis for example), so I lie instead because it's effective."
SuicideWatch,ez6v7uj,t1_ez6uhy3,1567715565.0,I stayed there and dated another girl (that I lied to about my job and everything else). We were together about 8 months until recently.
SuicideWatch,ez6ssyv,t1_ez6sefa,1567714910.0,"Lied to women about my life to date them. Got dumped by one of them on my second visit back to Japan on the second day back, after we had planned to take a month off work and travel together."
SuicideWatch,ez6mm7c,t1_ez6ma5v,1567713618.0,Can't afford it. I travelled to Japan recently using my grandfather's inheritance and blew it all.

SuicideWatch,ez4ryz4,t1_ez4rkzv,1567691278.0,None of it interests me anymore. Used to do gardening when young and the only people who socialise around here do so with drugs or alcohol.  Even people don't interest me.
SuicideWatch,ez4r2j9,t1_ez4qkom,1567690913.0,I've worked out consistently for 5 years and stopped recently because it was just strenuous and I didn't feel any better mentally. I just lost interest in music.
SuicideWatch,ez4qehn,t1_ez4q2fv,1567690644.0,"I have, and there isn't."
SuicideWatch,ez4py46,t1_ez4puvp,1567690458.0,It doesn't. Talking doesn't help. At least for me anyway.
SuicideWatch,ez4p3qg,t1_ez4oygm,1567690124.0,No point hanging on by a thread when life is constantly miserable and an unwanted chore.
