AskReddit,fqbykn3,t3_ght418,1589246483.0,"i’ve been having many nightmares one being my family mocking me in my face but i had another one which was smth very hunger games themed (mind u i’ve never seen the hunger games pls don’t attack me) i was reading a book in a garden and my dad opened the fence’s door to leave and i said “where are u going?” he said “to see the sports” i said “i can’t believe u’re going to support smth like this. this is not human,it’s disgusting” but by the time i turned to face him he was gone. the concept was that in this little town there were some ppl that had been infected with a very dangerous virus (no i definitely haven’t been affected by the whole thing😔)and they were making them do some kind of sports and whoever lost would get shot. in my brain i was like “if they’re that scared why are they putting them through this why don’t they just kill them all” and on the other hand i was like “these are sick ppl u can’t make sick ppl exercise they’re too weak” and after these thoughts i just jumped and i was like “wait who’s competing” and i started running towards the city center where there was a massive stadium with a very tall steel door and a bench on the outside where the boys who had been infected were sitting. i looked up and i realized 5/6 boys sitting there are ppl i’m very fond of (one being a friend of mine and the other one being my bff’s boyfriend) and the other one was some kind of politician’s son. i started crying and saying “i’m not gonna let this happen to u. i’ll get u out of here don’t worry” but they all seemed very calm alr and it felt like i was trying to convince myself rather than them. one of them smiled at me and said “it’s okay” and the massive steel door opened. at this point i saw how many ppl were there to watch this happening and i could spot my dad and sister. the weird thing about the door is that it opened from both the write and left side and it was split in the middle almost like 2 doors. i was standing on the right while the bench was on the left and all of the boys walked from the left to where i was and went in the stadium from the side i was standing. at this point i’m bawling my eyes out and almost my bff is behind me and i just say “how can i not cry that’s ur bf” and the games start they had to go and come back and i was staring at the floor bc i couldn’t look and the first sport was table tennis but without the table (idfk) and i heard them play and i could only see their shoes and then i see a ping pong ball drop and i hear a shot being fired. the sad thing is that i never got to see who got shot bc i woke up."
