lexapro,etvqouk,t3_cdmzcf,1563242266.0,"My heart rate also dropped about 20 beats at rest. I was sure it was my Apple Watch so I switched to an old Garmin but up it said the same thing. My doctor didn’t think it was the Lexapro but nothing else had changed. I was evaluated by a cardiologist and told that it was fine. 

My sleep has always been restless and that hasn’t changed but I eventually stopped taking Lexapro because I couldn’t make it through the day without a nap no matter when I took it. My heart rate only went up 10 beats after quitting. 

I’m glad that others noticed this too! Health anxiety is a big part of my GAD so it’s nice to know I wasn’t alone."

On the next screen, on the upper right, you’ll see blue text that says “Contact Us”. It opens up a window where you can type your question. When someone gets back to you, you’ll see an alert on the screen where the gear is. It was taken care of very quickly!"
HayDay,eroammw,t3_c2zg80,1561073358.0,I had the same thing and contacted support. They asked for some info and then deleted it for me. It was a quick process!
stopdrinking,ero47m2,t3_c304x1,1561067870.0,"Same. I read “One is too many, and a thousand not enough” and wow, that hit home. It’s great that you realize this and can carry it with you!"

plantclinic,eo9vss8,t3_bqw6oc,1558401366.0,"The pot is too big as well. They do much better in pots about 1/3 the diameter of the plant. 

I would repot it in lighter soil in a smaller pot and dome it for a few weeks. 

Good luck!"
