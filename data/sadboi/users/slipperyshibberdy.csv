halo,fpkuorp,t1_fpktqrc,1588701347.0,Good stuff. At the start of lockdown I was a halo 3 xbox 360 player which was a nightmare to find games on. I've just bought it and its downloading. Thanks for the heads up!
halo,fpks0rg,t1_fpk0y62,1588700031.0,Wicked! So it's worth buying then? I love halo 5 but man I miss the teabag culture.
halo,fpke5ee,t3_gdw81k,1588693036.0,"Thanks for the replies everyone! I'm havent really played halo properly since about 2009/2010 so I'm really coming back to it from the old days. Don't even know what MCC is, but from a quick google search and from what you've all said here, it sounds like I should get it! Peace out x"
BreakUps,fek52il,t1_fek47uc,1579192774.0,Thank you. I'm just wondering if that trust ever comes back. I know some situations where it has through time. But the process was agony. I swear I've aged 10 years.
BreakUps,fek4z4r,t1_fek4r2i,1579192718.0,Thanks man. You too. Cant delete her yet as we are stuck in a contract for a flat together so have to be able to speak about logistical and financial stuff. One month to go until the contracts up.
stopvaping,fdq5roc,t1_fdpiz6k,1578656093.0,Thats great man. Well done. I keep putting it off because it didnt hurt me as much as smoking but I HATE being a slave. It's like having a dummy that I cant put down.
mentalhealth,f7f0q1h,t1_f7f0o23,1573669906.0,Agreed. Edited.
relationships,f6h6l3r,t3_drbdfw,1572838247.0,"You are NOT a terrible person. Jealousy and insecurity are so real, powerful and difficult to keep at bay. You are so less alone than you think. 

Theres no black and white, I think it is possible to get passed. People aren't perfect and I've definitely done a lot worst in my life than lie to a partner about the last time I spoke to my ex. I've also kept in contact with exs who I've had 0 feelings for. The possibilities as to why he kept in contact with her are endless. So try to ask him straight up why he lied and why hes still in contact with her and take what he says at face value. If you catch him lying frequently then I would re-think whether you can be with him. In regards to being jealous about his passed relationship conversations, that is something you need to work on. Everybody has a passed and I'm sure you have spoken in loving ways to your exs as well.

A lot of people reading this will tell you to ""trust your gut"" and leave. Which I think is too easy to say. I personally suffer from insecurity and jealousy and if ""trusted my gut and left"" I wouldn't have any friends or romantic partners ever, because to be honest, my gut is a bad guy. It invents things, it mis-reads situations, it makes me jealous, it makes me paranoid, it makes me intense and guess what; it makes people lie to me because they are scared of how jealous, paranoid and intense I will get. 

I don't know the answer but constantly leaving relationships wont help your insecurity. If the relationship is worth something to you I believe it's worth trying to maintain, for you and for your self improvement. It may go wrong or it may not. But if you leave or sabotage the relationship, you're not giving yourself a chance. 

A few tips for your insecurities that worked for me;
- write down things you love about yourself *every day, however petty they may be Eg. ""I have nice eyes"" ""I have a good job"".
- write down reasons why you think your boyfriend loves you. Eg.  ""He kissed me today"" ""he bought be flowers today"" ""he came to meet me at the station"".
- remind yourself of some truths and write them down every day. Eg. ""Acting jealous is more likely to make him go off me"" ""I have no control over whether he cheats on me or not, and the more I worry about it, the more likely it is."" ""Everyone had a past""

*I mean every single day

Dont take all this as undeniable truth, you're better off speaking to a professional who can understand the ins and outs of your unique situarion. This is just what has helped me. 

I have ruined ALL of my relationships through insecurity and have nearly ruined the one I'm currently in so many times. I've created problems that aren't there and blown up problems that weren't a big deal. I got therapy and these are some of things hes helped me with. I'm not cured. But I'm getting better. Good luck x"
musicindustry,f6d8rbl,t3_dq8p3k,1572792315.0,"Hang around people who can make your dream job a reality. Dont be needy and pushy. Just be yourself and nice but always keep an eye open for a job. Thats how I did it, not even intentionally. Good luck."
relationships,f684uby,t3_dqn7ts,1572725496.0,"We sound like we are in a very similar situation. I was raised in a shitty household and although I'm not diagnosed bipolar I do have mental health issues and trust issues with women because of my mother. I keep hurting the loml and we've nearly broken up so many times. I dont know the answer but therapy has helped - but only if you stick at it and do the work,other wise it's pointless. Find the right one, preferably a Male therapist. It's not a quick fix and it's not cheap but its slowly saving my life. Good luck x"
SuicideWatch,f5ha6g7,t3_dnqstl,1572202589.0,Heya. I have dyspraxia too. It sucks. I used to fuck up all the time and piss everyone off. It made me feel similar. I dont know what's changed but I'm still here after years of suicidal tendencies and mental health issues. I'm not going to tell you to look on the bright side or that things get better because I honestly dont know the answer. But if you wanna chat I'm here.
relationships,f5e7h4a,t1_f5bjrjm,1572166109.0,"I don't want kids and use protection so I doubt that will happen. I personally disagree, I think most relationships are just 2 flawed people trying their best. Which is exactly what I'm doing, trying my best. And if someone breaks something very very personal of mine through a thoughtless act, i have every right to get annoyed. Sometimes things spiral. Not everyone is calm 100% of the time and I don't need believe you need to be in order to maintain a relationship. Understanding and forgiveness comes into it as well."
relationships,f57pmnx,t1_f57msr3,1572041232.0,"Thanks, you've been great to talk to. It goes more deep than my previous relationships. It was my childhood growing up. I had a narcissistic immediate member of my family who used to emotionally abuse me and play games with me. Switch from loving me intensely to locking me in my room and saying I ruined their life. It's always left me second guessing people. When the one person who was meant to look after me and love me unconditionally totally played games and manipulated me. It's hard for me to trust anyone."
relationships,f57ozvj,t1_f57m5dc,1572040839.0,It's a lot more grey than that. It was an accident but it was thoughtless. Shes not violent at all.
relationships,f57kn0m,t1_f57kj32,1572038030.0,I mean. They work together 5 days a week. But I cant exactly tell them to stop. I'm not concerned that shes attracted to him. I fancy a lot of people so does she. We are only human after all. I just want her to leave it at that like I do.
relationships,f57k7vz,t1_f57ja25,1572037754.0,And a blind man would find her attractive! Men always hit on her. I sometimes wish she wasnt so gorgeous lol
relationships,f57jmkr,t1_f57ja25,1572037367.0,"Thanks for the insight. Just for the record she doesnt go out drinking with Male colleagues much, this was an end of term drinks. Shes a teacher.. The guy is obviously attractive. A blind man would find him attractive. 

I've been through this with my therapist and because of my past and my mental health issues and abusive past Ending a relationship because of lack of trust would be counter intuitive. I'm attempting to maintain it so I  an learn how to trust and teach myself that not everyone is out to fuck me over, and of course be with someone who makes me very very happy. If I end a relationship everytime I lost trust I will NEVER have a relationship"
relationships,f57itqd,t1_f57hu3z,1572036857.0,I'm happy that you've said this. She made me feel really shit for getting ubset about this. I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees this as completely a out of order thing to do in a fight
relationships,f57go0v,t1_f57gif5,1572035807.0,"I think you're right. I guess the cheating part is kind of ""by the by"" and I should focus on the bigger issue. Thanks for being so insightful. Calmed me down a bit!"
relationships,f57fmmk,t1_f57f9xb,1572035384.0,"These arguments happen man, and I know we have some growing to do. It's never something I would want to break up over I just am wondering if people think I'm crazy to think she might have cheated that night."
relationships,f57f08i,t1_f57et5r,1572035149.0,Because she didn't seem to take it seriously. She just sort of shrugged it off. It really upset me
relationships,f57el5z,t1_f57e9qi,1572035004.0,"We are great most of the time, my trust issues stem from a deeper place, I don't trust most people. I am working on this and spending a lot of time trying to fix it.

The fight was because she broke my Â£800 favourite guitar in the middle of studio time guitar tracking week. I think it's a fairly reasonable reason to be angry. Edit\* it was an accident, but what she did was completely thoughtless, she hung a soaking wet bath matt over my guitar and it soaked up the water and expanded."
mentalhealth,f4mihyd,t3_dff5o6,1571678767.0,"Completely agree with this. I've ruined so many romantic relationships and friendships through following my ""gut"" based on no evidence whatsoever. Sometimes I've been right and sometimes I've been wrong. Sometimes people love you and aren't out to get you but your anxiety and depression will tell you they are and it's almost impossible to distinguish between anxiety/ depression and your ""gut""."
relationships,f4h7poy,t1_f4h72hf,1571588907.0,"I wish it was that black and white, each situation is different. I wish I knew why I say mean things when I'm upset. I'm still looking for the answer and getting professional help."
relationships,f4h0tj0,t1_f4gwyt4,1571586953.0,"The worst part of this is, we both have a flat together and would have to wait for the contract to end in January before we can move out."
relationships,f4h061e,t1_f4gzabi,1571586788.0,"I didn't actually get evidence, it was just all so obvious. She was hanging out with this guy when we were split up and he suddenly got really terrified around me. So we down and I said ""come on, it's obvious"". And her eyes gave it away and she admitted it."
relationships,f4gyzev,t1_f4gx3qg,1571586455.0,I can be horrible at times especially when someone hurts me. I never get actually get aggressive but I do say very upsetting things. I have a really sharp tongue at times.  It's not OK. I'm not looking for sympathy. It's my shit that I need to work out. Thanks for your honesty.
relationships,f4gyrr5,t1_f4gx5ev,1571586367.0,I think it was helping until she lied to me for the 2nd time. It was so painful that all the cbt I was doing was over powered by pain and anger.
