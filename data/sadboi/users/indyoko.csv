Anxiety,fr1mz8k,t1_fr1m9v8,1589822520.0,"meds often made things worse for me in the past, and its a process, just know you’re going to get through it no matter how bad it gets. i was having 4 hour panic attacks that would trigger PTSD episodes in between. they got to the point where i was having repeated seizures. it was awful and i thought i was going to end up in a hospital. its going to get worse before it gets better, i wish you the best of luck on your journey, i know how scary that shit is. God bless"
Anxiety,fr1mnnm,t1_fr1koaw,1589822364.0,"yes absolutely i agree! i just have had a past with meds making my mental health issues exponentially worse, and i was eliminating all factors to try and stop my panic episodes, and eventually i got to the pills and luckily enough it helped me. but please be careful and dont stop taking your meds because it worked for some guy on reddit! i still am in therapy and am working hard to get better everyday."

mentalhealth,fqcp4ea,t3_ghmx04,1589264443.0,"i have the same thoughts about past relationships of all kinds. my past relationships, my SO’s past relationships and i always wish i could change them.  i also have PTSD and often have intrusive “movies” that play of past traumatic events and they used to cause me to have panic attacks for multiple hours, which would trigger PTSD flashbacks and seizures. but you need to realize if it weren’t for those situations we wouldn’t be the people we are today. they are very hard to get rid of. saying “dont think about it” isn’t going to do shit. what i’ve been working on is taking the power out of the thoughts. because they’re gonna be there in some form or another for a long time. i used to try and stop them and distract myself and stop them short in their tracks by saying outloud “this is not what im going to think about”, or “its in the past you’re safe right this second” however there is this thing called the subconscious. there is some sort of obstruction in there causing these intrusive/obsessive thoughts, and unfortunately you don’t just have the power to say no to it. there is an underlying cause and until you can find that cause, accept it, and learn to move on, that trauma will present itself disguised as something else, AKA the intrusive thoughts. reminiscing through past traumas is no easy task, especially DEALING with them and learning to move on. its a struggle i deal with everyday. but once you can learn to distinguish your thoughts from the intrusive ones, you can take the power out of them. someone told me once, you can’t stop your body from taking a shit, but when you do take one you dont leave it there to sit and stink up everything around it, you flush it and its gone. not every thought you have is going to be a good one, you’re going to have some shitty ones, and when you do just flush them!! let the thoughts be there in their own world, and just don’t listen. don’t give them power!! that’s the key!!"
mentalhealth,fqco4iz,t1_fqb7f15,1589263582.0,"yeah man, i honestly say give it one last hoora . sit her down and say “we either need to fix this or we aren’t going to work”. i know it isn’t just that easy, but at least it will present to her the seriousness of a situation. you said you guys have been together for 20 years, maybe this talk will put you two on another 20, or it will cut it short. but you said it yourself, you know the relationship is failing. so if you sit and do nothing, maybe you guys will make it another few years or even twenty more, but you will be in the same boat or maybe an even worse one. me personally, i would rather be alone and use that 20 years of relationship experience toward the next one versus just stay in the relationship out of fear of being alone. you still have plenty of life left man, it would be a shame to come home to a wife who doesn’t love you or treat you like you deserve. you don’t wanna be that old man that hates his wife and his life. if you guys were to end soon, it wouldn’t be too late for you to find another person eventually, but if you stick around too long then it will be too late. hopefully something in here is useful to you guys man, i can only imagine how tough this is."
mentalhealth,fqb1ekc,t3_ghuz06,1589228886.0,"you gotta turn off reddit and go tell her these things man. know you’re worth, you said you weren’t easily replaceable which means she values you at least in some way. but your value doesn’t come from her, and you need to dig deep down and realize it. sit her down, and talk. don’t let her just smile and nod, have a CONVERSATION between the two of you. im sure she has her own concerns, same as you, and miscommunication seems like the biggest threat to you right now. if you sit her down and talk it out, and she doesn’t want to fix anything, then you pack your bags and you learn to love yourself until you find the right person who is willing to do simple adult things such as talk about your relationship. i would be surprised if you sat her down and brought up your concerns and she did nothing but smile and nod. you got this bro, and no mattwr what happens, you’ll be good. every single thing happens in life for a reason. all of the hard times you go through are experiences to learn from and shape you into the person that you were always meant to be. that sounds cliche, but i promise if you apply that mindset to challenging times, you start to look at them different. you see them as an obstacle in the race to the finish line, not the end of the world. im 18 years old and my girlfriend and i have better communication than you and your wife! don’t let that happen man!! don’t lose her or yourself to what ifs!! the only way you’ll know what you need to know, is if you talk to her about it !! best of luck man, may you find what you are looking for, God bless!"

depression,fpsftdl,t3_gf9rrp,1588872749.0,"the best thing about life is you can do whatever you want with it. the past does not define the future. you aren’t stupid for dropping out of college, and its understandable to gain weight in the current world situation.  don’t sit around all day waiting for things to get better because they won’t. you could get up and make things better for yourself. start with baby steps. write down what bothers you, how it makes you feel, and why it bothers you. then, create a plan to fix it. just one simple thing to practice everyday to better yourself. depression is an illness, you need to treat it like one. if you had corona, you wouldn’t stay home and let yourself suffer, so why do the same with depression?"
Anxiety,fpoo1sf,t3_geomhf,1588787730.0,"I also suffer from MDD, AD, and PTSD, and I’m the SAME FUCKING WAY I CAN’T BELIEVE IM NOT THE ONLY ONE. whenever im about to have an anxiety attack or PTSD episode, I try to inhale for 6 seconds and exhale for 11. I also squeeze my toes and then move up my body. The sensation of you doing that helps you stay in reality and can hopefully mitigate your attack. I have 2 or 3 hour anxiety attacks 2 or three times a day, and this is what I’m practicing to get better. It works."

mentalhealth,fp9m5nv,t3_gc6nax,1588429614.0,"the psychological effects of excessive use of weed can be gnarly. i started smoking weed in 7th or 8th grade and since then have only stopped for about 6 months . at first, the anxiety was crippling, all i wanted was to get high, but i couldn’t. eventually i picked it back up in a healthier way, but when i’m high sometimes i get BRUTAL anxiety attacks, PTSD like. i’ll start shaking uncontrollably, my heart beats out of my chest, i can’t breathe, and then i’ll get a flashback of some traumatic event and it will loop over and over until i get a vision of something that puts me into shock or someone shakes me out of it. so if you think the weed is causing problems, it is."

mentalhealth,fozca2g,t3_gaegat,1588188252.0,"you should definitely tell them. it seems awfully awkward at first, and doesn’t seem too beneficial, but it is. having a good support system is the best way to help manage your mental health. just sit them down and talk to them, write them a letter and give it to them, text them, whatever makes you feel comfortable, they’ll understand. it isn’t weird to want to be understood, and just because you acknowledge your problems doesn’t mean you’re undermining others!"

Glad to know it gets easier."
