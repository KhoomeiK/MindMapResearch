I'd say hold off on getting an epidural, you may not need it and epidurals can increase the risk of assisted delivery, but its always there if you feel you do need it, there are also other options such as gas & air and pethidine. Eating and drinking (if you're allowed) during labour can help you keep your strength up.

Other things to consider:

-delayed cord clamping
-managed or physiological third stage (placenta delivery)
-episiotomy or tear natural
-artifical rupture of membranes

You also have to think about whether you want the antibiotic eye gel and heb B vaccination for baby (if you're in the US because it's not done in the UK) and whether you want baby to have vitamin K injection.
