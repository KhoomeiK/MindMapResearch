bipolar2,fr1z9x1,t1_fr1y7xt,1589828467.0,"Thanks for the feedback!

I'd only be doing half a tab, and I am in a very safe, happy environment with 3 ""sitters"" who are staying sober and my boyfriend will be taking it with me and he does it a handful of times a year, so he knows what's up. I also don't have funds or means to buy a bunch to binge on later, so I'm not worried about the addictive aspects of bp taking over.

I'm bp2 with no psychosis and only go into hypomania, never true mania."
bipolar2,fquar9p,t3_gkwl1r,1589655333.0,"You're not alone, I do the same sort of thing. People are shocked how calmly I talk about traumatic experiences, as if I'm relaying a tv show. Has to do with dissociation, as far as I understand it."
BipolarReddit,fqr8q8q,t1_fqqwgcg,1589579692.0,"Hand tremors, dehydration, constant thirst and urination, constant upset stomach and diarrhea, severe scarring and painful cystic acne, concentration problems, weight gain. At lower doses it wasn't a big deal, but since increasing to this dose it has really made it hard to function."

BipolarReddit,fqq4xpn,t1_fqq4870,1589559466.0,"You've basically covered it, and add in some hand tremors, constant diarrhea, and the acne became really painful and cystic (and I've had bad acne all my life so for it to bug me is saying a lot)
Its mostly just that its all added up and become pretty severe and I'm tired of living miserable. When I was on a lower dose it was all manageable, but at 900 (which is apparently still a fairly low dose) its become no longer manageable. My bipolar grandfather has had a lot of luck with other stabilizers throughout his life, so I'm going to try one of those next I think."
BipolarReddit,fqpyb65,t1_fqpwl3l,1589556188.0,"The plan is to just wean off lithium first over the course of a couple of months, and then see if I need a new stabilizer then (or if issues arise before then, I'll call her). Since latuda has some stabilizing properties and I'm bp2 she didn't seem too worried.
Thanks for the reassuring words!"
BipolarReddit,four135,t3_g9gysv,1588088969.0,"I'm smoking way too much for sure, and I usually never drink (family history of alcoholism + addictive personality = no) but have been regularly buying alcohol to cope. Its been pretty rough."
AmItheAsshole,fojzqdn,t3_g7ofqr,1587832638.0,"YTA - you don't disown family simply because you have different aesthetics. Her body, her choice. Don't be surprised when she wants nothing to do with you in adulthood."
BipolarReddit,fojvqh7,t3_g7p2fi,1587830378.0,"I like to refer to these episodes as being ""functionally depressed."" Like, I can still do the things I want to do, but anything outside of my wants just doesn't get done, and everyone seems able to tell that I'm generally not myself but I feel like I'm fine, because here I am still doing the things I really want to get done, its not like I'm just stewing in bed being lazy like when I'm full blown depressed. So, yeah, its a thing. Self care can help from preventing a full blown depressive episode, but definitely talk to your doctor as soon as you can - most places are doing phone appointments for now."
BipolarReddit,foga6sv,t3_g77j3i,1587749961.0,"This gives me some hope for the potential of having children and raising them right while still struggling with this illness. That's been a huge fear since my diagnosis. You made those little beans and they clearly love you so much, and are so sweet. Thanks for sharing, I hope tomorrow is better."

For example, I'm in Canada and lately the weather has been ""more bipolar than me"". Then again, everyone around me knows that I am bipolar."

BipolarReddit,fe9y3mg,t3_eo7to8,1578942485.0,Antidepressants can definitely cause mania if not paired with a mood stabilizer. Happened to me about a year ago. Your antipsychotic med might also work as a stabilizer but 100% clarify with your doctor before making any changes
bipolar,fdp1bec,t3_emdhas,1578617641.0,"I'm on 900, but all at once. I had horrible tremors, nausea, vertigo, and a general zombie feeling the first month taking lithium, and then these symptoms would pop up again when I increased my doses, but besides that all have subsided since then and I'm getting close to a year on it. I hope everything eases up for you too, its been a very beneficial medication for me."
