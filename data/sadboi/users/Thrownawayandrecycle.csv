Black Heart
Its a lot harder to love
when you have one
Wear it on your sleeve
like a scarlett letter 
stripes down your back 
inflicted by your circumstances
These words inspired
by a mixture
of empathetic affliction
and apologetic vindiction 
A critique of my own mind x2

A vision
refined by
a life of hardship
and defined lies
These inorganic shapes in the night sky
connecting all the dots just to see a sign
A constant hatred 
of this repeated pattern
the stigma is what I'd like to shatter 
The destruction of babble gave us all the languages 
Now its our time to write our own pages and 
cleanse the black hearts
we painted not to feel again 
heal within - us
Dispell the trust
of the blackened heart

To blame
is to take aim
at the design
this feeling of disdain
the instilled shame
Pain
its coursing
shivers from the shock
coming to a stasis
breathing coming to a stop
Recalcitrant Minds 
blind to the gaze
ambiguous faces
are they kind
are they fake
A notion replaced by reality
don't you see we're destined for hypocrisy
Emotions bleed
passionate potential
susceptible to kindles 
the gaslight burned bright

The grass at your feet
The gas at your feet"

""If [the student] cannot refuse to play a role in the comedy or drama of the world, at least he understands that it is all a game.... They teach him to look...at the incessant working of his mind and the physical activity displayed by the body. He ought to succeed in understanding, in noting, that nothing of all that is *from him, is him. He, physically and mentally, is the multitude of others.*

This ""multitude of others"" includes the material elements - the ground, one might say - which he owes to his heredity, to his atavism, then those which he has ingested, which he has inhaled from before his birth, by the help of which his body was formed, and which, assimilated by him, have become with the complex forces inherent in them constituent parts of his being.

On the mental plane, this ""multitude of others"" includes many beings who are his contemporaries: people he consorts with, with whom he chats, whose actions he watches. Thus a continual inhibition is at work while the individual absorbs a part of the various energies given off by those with whom he is in contact, and these incongruous energies, installing themselves in that which he considers his ""I,"" form there a swarming throng.

This actually includes a considerable number of beings belonging to what we call the Past.... personalities with which he might have been in contact in the course of his reading and during his education.""

[Watts interrupts the quote] This is no other than a description of the organism, the body, as inseparable from a system of physical relations, and of the ego as G.H. Mead's ""generalized other,"" the individual's feeling or conception of himself arising from social intercourse. As to reincarnation, she continues:

""When the student becomes aware of this crowd in himself, he should avoid imagining, as some do, that it represents memories of his preceding lives. There is no lack of those who state and are convinced that such and such a personage, who lived in the past, is reincarnated in them. Stories depicting reincarnation are innumerable in Asia where they keep alive the childish thirst for the marvelous among the masses."""
