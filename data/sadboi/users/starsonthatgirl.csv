I know when we were younger, we thought that 20 was adults and you know exactly what you want and act the way you are until you die.

But that is not the case.

It is a constant stream of trial and error, just like growing up but this time you are growing up mentally instead of physically. Okay, maybe physically, too, but let's not focus on that portion.

There is not one way to adult and everyone's journey is different. We no longer live the way our parents do and they are not aware of the new problems that we face because they cannot fathom another way to do things other than the way that they've done things. Just like strangers who judge you for not doing what they think is right.

Who knows, maybe your parents are very open minded and see the world for what it is - different.

Or they will most likely judge from afar because they are concerned about you and you do come from them. They have a lot of investment in you, but your life should not be what you think they want from you.

You have endless possibilities in this life. Maybe that thought is more anxiety inducing but worrying about how your parents view your life should be the very last thing you should care about. If you're happy and healthy, they will be happy for you regardless. They just want you to be okay."

Start your own family/support via the friends you meet and the people who care about you - maybe even work with. I have my work family that are really great but we don't hang out outside of work.

He is 4 years older than I am, beat me until I could fight back, and now isn't supposed to eat things like bread and alcohol but he does because he doesn't like being told what to do and wants to be just like everyone else. When he does consume things that don't metabolize correctly in his body, he becomes aggressive, flighty, risk taking behavior comes out but he doesn't have any sort of reaction time (he's been in 4 automotive accidents and he's 34 this year), and gets really annoying ticks. I can deal with it but I think he's aggressive and does risky things because no one has ever listened to him all his life. He is absolutely disregarded by society and most individuals. My dad just yells at him as a form of communication, unfortunately. He's getting better at it but it sucks to be around both of them at the same time.

He also never understands when people are picking on him. My sister and I have stood up for him all his life at school but he thought that because those people were talking to him and others were laughing, that they were his friends.
