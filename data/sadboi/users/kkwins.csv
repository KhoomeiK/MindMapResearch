awfuleverything,fgdvgoe,t3_exn0x2,1580687383.0,"Idk if it’s a sphynx thing but mine definitely has always eaten like this. Sometimes with more or less gusto. Cats may cronch the dry food but they aren’t fully chewing it. Shit a lot of dogs don’t even chew their food. And that’s from 10+ years of experience in the pet industry seeing a variety of dogs & cats. 
I got my sphynx kitten a smaller kibble size food and that seems to help. (It digests faster than the large kibble sizes.) His caloric requirements seem much higher even as an adult due to having to maintain his body temp. So he eats a lot."

mentalillness,f34u766,t3_dfnvko,1570660801.0,"The only person who will be able to consistently help you become a better person is you. You have to learn new behaviors and that requires practice and determination. I think it is up to each individual to learn how to be a better person. Expecting those close to you to teach you how to be better is putting too much on them. 
We receive feedback from those around us constantly. If you say something off color, people around you may cast away their eyes or awkwardly laugh. If you say something mean there will be a response. For me I catalog this feedback throughout the day and when I have a moment I look at it. I question myself, “Was that behavior appropriate?” “Did I hurt that persons feelings?” “What could I have said differently to make that person feel more comfortable?” And so on. 
Talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy would also be helpful. Learning how to retrain your brain to think differently is crucial. When you have been belittled and stepped on it is easy to do that to other people because it’s familiar. Your brain has little pathways that it follows and will continue to follow because it is the path of least resistance. Training your brain to take a different path is fucking hard. When someone says something mean to you,  ones natural reaction may be to lash out/get angry/cry/etc. Instead you might choose to have compassion and ask yourself why they are hurting. Or you might simply “ignore” the comment, knowing it is a reflection of them and not you. These are just examples.
One day you might find someone, a partner or close friend who will help provide more direct feedback. (E.g. “You saying this hurt me.” “It may be better to do this instead of this.” ) but the reality is that is not guaranteed. AND most importantly you have to be open to that feedback at the time. 
I wish you luck. If you ever want someone to chat with about stuff, I’m happy to play devils advocate."
mentalillness,f34smjc,t3_dfnhqj,1570659730.0,"I think it starkly depicts potential negative aspects of mental illness. It was dark & depressing for sure. But I don’t think boycotting it is necessary. If you know depressing shit triggers you then you probably shouldn’t see it. No it isn’t going to show all the successes of mental illness, the people who live normal, happy lives—that wasn’t the narrative."
mentalillness,f34s66o,t3_df5six,1570659427.0,"I don’t feel like the movie says he kills because he is mentally ill or that it was the cause of his murdering. I feel like his decent into murdering was caused by factors outside of his mental illnesses. I believe killing provided control for him, his life was out of control (loosing his job, learning his whole reality was false, being picked on, getting the shit beat out of him). He also found he enjoyed killing, he was a sadist and a sociopath. His life with his mother was fucked up even before he found out the truth of his childhood, etc. I think a lot of factors drove him to kill and once he was receiving attention from his followers he really enjoyed that as well. 
No we aren’t all hurting but many are. And no we don’t all wish others felt our pain or pain in general, but some do. Joker is an example of the worse case scenario of what can happen when mental illness, trauma, societal failures happen to someone. 
When the credits rolled I felt sad. Sad that he could have chosen another path. Sad that so many people and the community failed him. But I saw he chose to become that monster. He chose his path. It wasn’t romanticized, he was a hollow person by the time the anarchy began. He was no longer deserving of our pity once he chose murder. I enjoyed the movie."
