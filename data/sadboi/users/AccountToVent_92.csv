For eight semesters of courses, that's roughly FIVE FULL SEMESTERS of, frankly, bullshit coursework. How the hell does this help anyone?!?

I wasn’t aware of that updated requirement. It seems like a lot on the surface, but the thing with Cornell is that “outside your major” means, for instance, if you major in math, courses that don’t count as requirements and/or electives specifically for the math major would be fine for your distribution requirements. So, if you’re a math major, and take a bunch of upper-level physics, computer science, engineering, etc. courses that aren’t listed as courses that count towards the math major, you’d be fine.

Also, you’d be shocked at what you can petition to count towards certain distribution requirements. I was in the band, and had friends who were engineering majors who petitioned for marching band to count towards their liberal arts credits. It was accepted. I shit you not.

And honestly, in most of the job interviews I’ve had since college (I graduated 5 years ago), the fact that I went to Cornell has been brought up, unprompted, by the people interviewing me.

It’s an interesting quirk of our political system. So in a situation where there is no President-elect or Vice President-elect, Pelosi would become President, since she would still be the incumbent Speaker until such a time as a new one is elected. 

Edit: also the new Congressional terms begin on January 3 following elections in November, and incumbents retain their seats until their successors are sworn in on January 3 (if they didn’t contest their seat, or were voted out), and are continuously considered to be in office during and after the election. It’s not like in the UK, where incumbent MPs running for re-election technically aren’t MPs during an election, and where an MP’s term begins as soon as they’re declared the winner of their seat. So if Trump had resigned as President after the 2018 elections, Pence would have become President, and if Pence had then resigned, Ryan would have become President, despite being an outgoing congressman, since he was still Speaker.

Listen. If Sanders manages to become the nominee, I’ll vote for him. I won’t like it, but I’ll do it to keep Trump out. But he hasn’t been my first (or second, or third, or...) choice as the primary campaign has gone on. At any rate, my state’s primary doesn’t happen until the end of next month.

And here goes Reddit again, downvoting people who should ostensibly be on the same side! News flash, people - during a primary, people are allowed to have differing opinions. That’s... kind of the point of a primary. Once there’s a nominee, that’s the time to coalesce around them. But when you have a contested primary, you can’t expect people to agree 100% with you on everything, especially during an election cycle that had 29 people vying for the Democratic nomination."

If you rent, maybe explain the situation to your landlord and try to get out of your lease. Or, if your lease is up before you’re due, even better. Either way, try and move out before the baby is born, dump the “boyfriend” over text, and block him everywhere. Only contact him through an attorney, since you’ll need one to sue him for custody, which will impact things like child support.

He can’t “refuse to leave” if you leave him, and he can’t contact you. And since there’s generally a threat that abusers escalate their behavior when you leave them, maybe try and move in with family or a friend you trust, so you’re not alone at first."

Probably, honestly. Or an even worse one... because young women who ask to be sterilized are generally not taken seriously, either. And then, they have to face the added “bonus” of paternalistic and condescending questions about “what if your future husband wants kids” or, if already married, “and how does your husband feel about that?” 

Not to say that either situation (a guy or girl being dismissed by their medical professional, without so much as a discussion, for wanting to be sterilized) is remotely acceptable. But women are absolutely not exempt from the same BS."
