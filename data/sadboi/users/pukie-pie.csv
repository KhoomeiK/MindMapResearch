JuniorDoctorsUK,fp9xn98,t3_gc35i6,1588436681.0,"not sure about this data. first of all the workload manageability - i don't want my workload to be so 'manageable' that i'm bored. the ones that have the highest manageability seem to be predominantly sit-down jobs with not much thinking-on-your-feet involved (histopath, radiology, derm, psych). this might suit some people but definitely doesn't suit others. acute emergencies will almost always feel unmanageable, but that's where the excitement and challenge comes in and that's where a lot of people thrive. 

&#x200B;

secondly, for me the satisfaction ratings don't mean much. as i read from the bottom to the top of the list, i personally see less fulfilling and less exciting jobs. the idea of doing eyes day in and day out or looking down microscopes rather than at patients forever fills me with horror. i have a feeling the satisfaction ratings are closely tied in with work-life balance - which is obviously very important but also depends on the individual. at the same time, i think we need to pay more respect to the med reg's and the core medical trainees. it sometimes seems like a thankless job and i think we need to appreciate them more - they are often the struts that hold up the acute medical unit!"

EDAnonymous,fp962o7,t1_fp7poqq,1588415748.0,"i am also a doctor with an eating disorder and the sad thing is this almost doesn’t surprise me. eating disorders, depressive illness and anxiety disorders are way over-represented in us. luckily my mood and ED is not as bad as it has been in the past but the occupation is such strong fuel for disordered behaviours that it can make it hard to survive in this line of work.

this also applies to nursing (which in my opinion is harder than being a doctor - especially right now). this applies to people in healthcare with ANY mental health problem.

bulimia,ew8gwcx,t1_ew6mvt3,1565209412.0,"Ok so I've just done a bit of reading around this.

Basically it looks like I was wrong lol. I think I just remember reading one poorly written article claiming that chronic caffeine consumption can increase appetite through increasing baseline cortisol levels but I think that was probably turned into scaremongering.

Essentially it looks like the evidence for and against caffeine as an appetite regulator either way is mixed. There's a [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20190) that claims it reduces food intake in overweight/obese individuals only, but [another one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666314004498) saying it has no effect at all. There's also [this one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2004.00389.x) that claims caffeine enhances the appetite suppressant effect of nicotine (wouldn't recommend taking up smoking though). There are quite a few studies that look at caffiene's effect on cortisol too, specifically [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305706000645) that shows caffeine enhances cortisol spikesin response to exercise etc, in women more than men. [Another one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2257922/) here that claims chronic caffeine consumption can actually dampen the cortisol response. Cortisol btw is a well known appetite stimulant.

I think my previous comment about caffeine having different effects on appetite at different doses was misguided.... [This review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09637486.2017.1320537?needAccess=true) (I can't access it in full tho) claims the literature is in favour of caffeine being an appetite suppressant depending on when it is ingested in relation to meals, but I think it's much more complex than that especially with the crossover of ""mental stress"" and EDs etc (interestingly there are quite a few articles looking at the reasons for and effects of caffeine consumption in individuals with EDs ... apparently bulimics consume the most!)

Thanks for raising this point btw .. I'm glad I looked into the evidence a bit more or else I would have continued believing bullshit facts lol

We can demonise it like you seem to be suggesting or, as Nietzsche said (sorry not sorry), “to live is to suffer and to survive is to find meaning in the suffering”. 

Secondly I think it’s patronising that you claim this thread is attention seeking. Clearly you have never experienced the bewildering paradox that is self-destructiveness. There’s a juxtaposition of self-loathing with superiority, this feeling that we deserve the absolute worst but are also invincible enough to withstand anything. Or at least that’s one way to look at it. I think it’s a fascinating glimpse into the human psyche. Just because it’s not conventionally “good”, doesn’t mean it’s “bad” and we should try and erase it from people with a YouTube link. 

I’m glad you find the video uplifting. So did I. But to me that’s like if I were picking up a violin for the first time and watching a video of someone whose a world class violinist and trying to get from here to that.

But yeah I think in psychiatry the medics are good at the diagnosis side of things from symptoms and signs and data. You guys are really good at digging deep for a different sort of information and getting a real picture of the person. 
 
One of the GPs I was on placement with dealt solely with the homeless, most of whom had PDs and loads of other psychosocial problems. For each of his pts he'd make a drawing / diagram so he could visualise the complexity and understand better why things got to how theywere. I thought it was lovely and refreshing, he was a great dr.

""What is the point of eating if you just throw it back up?"" - Someone once asked me this, and the answer is so complex. It's like asking a drug addict why they use. ""My mom is really kind of fucked up"" I mean I don't know her but I wouldn't say this to her face lol, like someone else said, we can be very sensitive and perceive a lot of things negatively. Plus, most of us know we're kinda fucked up. Eating and puking is obv not normal and the reason your mum hasn't spoken up is because of embarrassment and shame. We know puking is gross, in fact it just goes to show how all consuming the disorder is when we continue despite that. 

My advice to you - Tell her you're worried about her. Ask her if she wants to talk about it. Let her know that you can't promise to understand it but you'll try anyway. Encourage her to get professional help, or at the least, get her electrolytes checked, a dentist checkup, etc. 

Also if the puking noises are really bothering you, try and think of a solution together. Like maybe ask her if she can let you know before she does it and you can put headphones on or whatever. Please please don't ever say or imply that what she does disgusts you, even if it does. We know what people see on the outside, and it makes us feel super ashamed, so don't reinforce it.

Another thing she taught me was mindfulness. Just acknowledging the urge and the sensations in your body (prob heart beating fast, feeling twitchy) then saying “ok I’m going to sit completely still for 2 whole mins and just focus on what’s going on in my body and then see where the urge is after”.

Thankfully he was conscious and I asked someone nearby to call 999, while I asked him a few questions - his name, if he had somewhere to stay, any pain, etc. Paramedics arrived and I had to leave for an appointment but I kept going over in my head stuff I could have done differently, like calling 999 myself, better questions I could have asked, or staying with the paramedics longer to help (I asked but they said it was ok to leave). Ultimately he’d been there for a while according to the people who came out of the shop nearby to help me, so I tried to see the positive side that I had at least stopped to help!

There are three things that have stopped me from binging and purging in the past. 1. Anorexia nervosa - would not recommend. 2. Bad break-ups during stressful exams. Also pretty painful. 3. Never being alone in the house. Which I fucking hate because I don’t have a partner and my parents can be a nightmare to live with but sometimes what I truly need is to be babysat and force fed a few meals and after a few days of the agony of that I tend to find space in my head for thinking about things other than binging. 

Basically try and surround yourself with people which is easier said than done if like me, people annoy the shit out of you. 

Wish I had better advice!"

EDAnonymous,eu8cgao,t1_eu7ymbm,1563554329.0,Can I just say thanks for sticking up for doctors. I hear a lot of people attacking medics when most of us are really just trying our best. We're human and make mistakes too!

EDAnonymous,eu7sfuy,t1_eu7hmqw,1563541693.0,"I personally think the diagnostic criteria are far too arbitrary. The low body weight criterion is mostly used as a risk stratifying tool. Anorexia nervosa literally means “nervous loss of appetite” ie a *psychological* drive to stop eating. Therefore it can affect someone of any weight. When I was in a normal weight range and restricting my doctor coded my diagnosis as “atypical anorexia nervosa”. I think it’s odd that this falls under EDNOS though. 

Personally I think the AN diagnosis itself should be subclassified by weight as an indicator of *risk* of physical deterioration, rather than using entirely different diagnostic codes as the primary disorder is a psychiatric one, not a physical one."
