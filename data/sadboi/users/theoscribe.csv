You can literally kill a tarrasque with a cantrip (mage hand) if you wanted to, although I would reccomend a single spell (unseen servant) for that. You need two bags of holding- trick is to get said bags close enough to the tarrasque without getting splattered, and put one inside the other. That sends everything within 10ft straight to the astral plane, no saving throw. Bags of holding are cheaper than the consumable items found at high levels anyway."
