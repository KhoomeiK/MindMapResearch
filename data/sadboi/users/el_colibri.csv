Coronavirus particles are so small that they can fit through the weave of most household cloth materials. Medical masks, such as N95 respirators, use special materials that create difficult to navigate pathways in the fabric that make it very hard for these tiny particles to get through the material. They also are specially fitted to the face of each healthcare worker to minimize gaps that these particles can get through.

> Many commentators have been distracted by this, not realizing that the droplets that are ejected from an infected mask wearer are far bigger than the virus particles, and are easily blocked with around 99% efficacy, as shown in this recent NEJM paper that used laser light scattering to explore the effect.

That's the thing about masks, we need to change our thinking about them. DIY mask wearing offers little protection to the wearer, absolutely, but the magic lies in protecting others. A physical face covering can block 99% of virus droplets from entering the air and infecting others.

About the touching bit, yeah that can be an issue but if they're worn by the majority, the germs that you are touching on your mask are your own and are harmless. I can definitely see a potential downside there though, but the benefits outweigh the negatives!

And absolutely social distancing, hand hygiene etc. must be part of the measures. I'd argue mask wearing to be just as important.
