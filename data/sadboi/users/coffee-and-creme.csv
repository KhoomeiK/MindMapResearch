bipolar2,fjom4vm,t3_fek5an,1583530538.0,"It sounds like cyclothymia to me. (I am not a doctor though!) Those with cyclothymia experience hypomania and depression. Individuals with bipolar 2 experience hypomania and major depression. Individuals with bipolar I experience mania and major depression. (This is a super basic way of explaining it all!!!)

Cyclothymia is definitely real. :) I encourage you to find a doctor who doesnt just tell you that you are ""fine."" I have Bipolar 2 and now that I am medicated properly for it, I'm doing great. However i was told by a former psychiatrist that I was ""fine"" too...he was really dismissive.

Edit: to answer your question... there is no ""good"" or ""easier to deal with"" version of bipolar 😉 Cyclothymia, bipolar 2, and bipolar 1 all are very different and come with unique challenges...each of these unique challenges are so terribly difficult to deal with when not properly treated. But when properly treated, there is hope of feeling stable. 😊"
bipolar,fjkxali,t3_fdud73,1583435735.0,"Nights can absolutely be so isolating.

I work nights because it works really, really well for me. I find it to be really relaxing personally (this is definitely an uncommon viewpoint though) because I am a night owl naturally, so I get a really good nights sleep when I work nights. When I would work days, I would barely get five or six hours of sleep a night. Not nearly enough for me! 😅

Even though this is my preferred shift, it does come with drawbacks. I can't go to meetups that happen during weekday afternoons (99% of the ones I want to go to lol).

You gotta weigh the pros and cons, I think! For me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons of working nights. If it makes you feel really off and weird, listen and honor that feeling, okay? 💕"

bipolar,fiukql3,t3_f9v2b4,1582743257.0,"Hi there. I know this can be a difficult thing to understand, since you are not bipolar. That is completely okay, and to be expected. That is why there are many support groups out there for friends and family who have loved ones who are bipolar.

I'd like you to remember that your friend is also likely in a living hell of her own, just trying to find some peace. Depressive episodes tend to make us isolate ourselves...which means unfriending people, leaving Discord channels that we once were active in, not replying to texts or calls, etc. None of this is malicious. But to someone who isn't bipolar, how could it seem anything BUT malicious? A neurotypical person may wonder, ""Doesn't my friend know they are hurting me by doing these things?!"" The answer is no, my dear. They are trying to make it through the day by taking these actions. That may sound dramatic, but I assure you, it is not.

I find that education on this subject goes a long way. If you like to read, I highly suggest reading books on bipolar meant for friends and family specifically. Search Amazon for kindle versions of these books and you can download samples for free to see if they will help.

Best wishes to you and your friend.

bipolar,fiuifh6,t3_f9xgfn,1582742002.0,"Hey there. I hear you on this. 100%.

What you are describing sounds a lot how I feel in my lowest of lows. I seldom feel sadness. I feel...nothing. There is no joy in anything. I believe this is called ""anhedonia."" It's a terrible feeling...I would sleep all day, everyday, and still never feel rested. Not sure if that's you too...but we all go through this differently...how we all go through it is absolutely valid.

I needed a med change to come out of this. Please call your psychiatrist and talk to them about this. This is definitely a cause for concern, and you do not need to just suffer through it. Make sure your doc knows. ❤

Edit: Also it sort of sounds like dissociative stuff...but I am not a doctor...it is best to let your doc know. You described your symptoms extremely well, and your doc will be able to help. 💕"
bipolar,firjc14,t3_f8xcqr,1582665479.0,This looks so peaceful and gorgeous. You did a great job! I'd love to see more. 💕
bipolar,finvpp7,t3_f8vs3p,1582571125.0,"""I don't deserve to feel like that."" Very strong words, said by an obviously strong person. 💕 That's exactly right. You deserve happiness, safety, and to feel content in your bones! We don't get a handbook on how to do that though, so do what you think is best, at this moment in time. If distancing yourself from those people makes you feel good, and lightens your emotional load, then that is simply the right move for you right now. 😊 At least, that's my opinion!

I have also distanced myself from old, old friends who I considered ""lifetime"" friends. I don't think they are inherently bad or evil people, but they are not good for me at this time...and I, too, deserve to feel happy, safe, and content in my bones.

You got this. 🙌

Ninja edit to add: This was also a heartbreaking transition for me. Thankfully I had a friend or two in a new circle of people that I could compare my former ""lifetime"" friends to, and I saw how differently they treated me. I started to wonder why I prioritized the people who treated me poorly (old friends) over the people who treated me wonderfully (new friends). After some time I was able to grieve the loss of my old friends. It doesn't hurt as much at all anymore now."

ANYWHO.

I was so nervous my first session too. Stomach was in knots. Writing things down to talk about made me feel a bit better, cuz then I could kinda know what to expect.

bipolar2,fi1fzl0,t1_fi0ex4b,1582057001.0,"That makes total sense dude - I wouldn't be able to find the sense in it either. How can it make sense for it to be a ""helpful message"" if it was said to you with such malicious intent for so long?? It is so hard to reconcile that in the brain. From what you wrote, you made this clear to your therapist and she can now adjust her treatment plan. :) You did great!!! HELL YEAH!

Omg I was also super resistant to medication at first too! For different reasons. I'm happy we are both OK with medication now and on the right track. :) 

I have an analogy that my therapist told me in the beginning that helped me a lot...if you don't get much from it that's okay hehe:

>Before therapy, you can liken these issues to a wound that you keep putting a bandaid over. It scabs over, but you pick it, it bleeds, and you apply another bandaid. Therapy can be like ripping off a scab, applying cleaning solution, cleaning the wound (which can be very painful!)...but then it heals properly, and there is no scab left to pick.

It may be that you are in the ""cleaning the wound"" period where things are really, really difficult. But this is the most important time to keep going. I know this time is so freakin' hard. I am proud of you for being vulnerable with your therapist. I remember when I was in that period, my ENTIRE BODY went numb. My body was reliving the trauma but I pushed the words out somehow because I couldn't live with the secrets anymore.

You're NOT alone. You did good by posting here. You go, dude. <3"

bipolar2,fhzpk2q,t3_f5mu74,1582006681.0,"I completely understand why hearing your therapist say this made you upset. I think the way your family told you these things was absolutely the wrong way, so this message is filled with poison now...it doesn't matter who says it, however kindly.

So I think this message needs to eventually come from inside you! Does what your therapist said make sense? About being less exhausted if you ""scale back""? I know ""different"" is always scary, so heck, so we are always more comfortable with ""familiar"" even if it isn't so good for us. (Brain, why you do this?) Maybe your therapist can explain how you can ""scale back"" but still 100% honor your emotions. I completely get not wanting to repress things, bottle up and then explode. I bet your therapist will help you through that too 😁

Anywho...

I'm glad that you are able to express yourself so well and have such honest and open conversations with your therapist. I know right now is so hard, but you are taking all of the right steps. Remember that a good therapist will have YOUR goals in mind. Keep being honest!!!"

I'm getting that he was more thinking of himself, and not really about you or anyone else. I sense that this is a time for introspection for him...

Also, I feel that you are very anxious or nervous, and you very much wanted him to allay your fears or comfort you in some way, but he did not do that.

I asked the cards how you can move forward from this very anxious time...they indicated that you must have confidence and keep going, keep moving forward. It's going to take a lot of willpower but you've got this, okay?

I also sense that this is not just an everyday situation that has got you rattled. This is a big, big deal for you and impacts your life.

tarot,fbicw0x,t3_ed0y6t,1576897367.0,"Hi there!
Lot of Major Arcana cards here. Did your client perhaps ask about an important life event? The Major Arcana energy suggests this is an important time in your client's life.

This looks like a beautiful and positive reading, to me. The past is in the past-- has your client turned over a new leaf? Maybe a big shift in career - from something that made them unhappy, and now moving into...The Sun! Your client is doing a wonderful job in the present, and she had to go through a big transformation in the past to get here.

The love she is experiencing in the present will help lead her to her calling in life. She will feel reborn.

To get there, your client needs to prioritize appropriately. She cannot do EVERYTHING, she must sleep and eat sometimes too! There will be a lot of decisions to be made, a lot of tasks to complete, and she must not wear herself out by not prioritizing, or doing so poorly.

I hope this makes sense!"
