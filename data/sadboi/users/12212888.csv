Or maybe your friends drain your energy, are they toxic? Or maybe they are just loud or tiring, you need friends that refill that energy not drain it"

depression,fbud65l,t1_fbsl0sa,1577112311.0,"Dont think like that, things can get better , you have to take little steps, you cant expect yourself to suddenly be able to go outside like that, phobias are extremely hard to overcome, i personally have a pretty bad phobia that prevent me from doing a lot of things, im not saying i know how you feel since your phobia is different than mine, it takes time and endurance, it dosent feel like you can get out of it and thats just lying to yourself, the power of your mind is stronger than you think, while you may feel weak, your not and you can get through it, so many other people are going through the same thing you are, if you kill yourself than you will just be another one of them that committed suicide , get through it, if not for yourself , then for them, have a story to tell , you overcoming it could help so many people . Take those steps little by little , even if you “fail” its still a huge accomplishment that you even tried to begin with, be proud of that. Its a long road but when you end it theres no coming back, you can get through it , if you haven’t already seek a therapist , i wish you the best

depression,fbubnd2,t3_ee8ixe,1577111516.0,"I feel that way too im unmotivated , i have no hobbies and all i do is lay around if im not cleaning, going to school or eating, i havent been eating right either , my body has gotten so used to not eating untill 12 i physically feel sick if i try to eat any earlier yet im still hungry during my school days, but ive been trying some things, find something that makes you feel energized, for me its skateboarding, the feeling of the wind in my hair and the sound of the wheels against the pavement is my favorite thing ever, when i get really mad or stressed or sad i just imagine skateboarding down a really high hill and it helps a lot, find that thing for you, try a sport at school, drawing, guitar, cooking, baking, sewing,maybe you like reading comic books or manga,even something like videogames is better than nothing, try to get yourself into a routine, get up ealier eat something, drink a cup of coffie if you need it, go on a run or for a walk, i know the thought of even getting up sucks but the more you think about it the less likely you are to do it, just get up as fast as you can without thinking, don’t procrastinate , go outside and go for a walk, even if it’s short its still progress, you have the right to feel like you accomplished something that day no matter how small it may be, remember you will is everything, lets say one day you screw up, you sleep in until 2pm your rooms a mess, you didnt get anything done that day, its ok, its ok to slip up just bounce back the next day. This isnt going to be easy and your NOT going to feel better the first day you start doing all this, your gonna feel like shi*t your gonna be tired and want to lay back down, thats ok , it takes time , your body has to get used to that new routine. If you find yourself laying back down again, dont be upset that you “failed” because its a huge step forward that you even got up in the first place, little by little , it will get better, your not alone, im here too, thousands of people are in the same boat as you, survive for them, keep pushing forward for them and for yourself, so you have a story to tell when you overcome this."
