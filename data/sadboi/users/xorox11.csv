learndota2,fr1lg44,t3_glx66t,1589821776.0,"hello and welcome to dota 2, first of all unless you are a very fast learner, i DO NOT suggest playing ranked until you have over 500 hours, but everyone knows themselves the best so if you think you are okay with playing ranked, i cant argue with that.

&#x200B;

i can tell that 500 mmr is pretty low, but its not hopeless, since you are a beginner, you shouldnt really dwell on losing games aswell as losing mmr, just have fun and try to get better, you will find yourself getting up eventually, if you stuck on same bracket while trying to get better, then you do something wrong and you should find and fix it as soon as possible.

&#x200B;

but just dont forget 260 hours is VERY low for a game like dota 2 and you REALLY shouldn't feel bad for having a low mmr like that, not even gonna mention boosters on that mmr, and smurfs in over 2.5k mmr."

learndota2,fqe5cwx,t3_gicyou,1589302013.0,"700+ match master tier arc with %60~ winrate here.

i agree with you that arc doesnt feels good now, but you can be pretty sure he doesnt feels bad either, and he is so fun to play since you micro whole game and dont have a space to breathe.

Here is my answers to your questions.

1- i follow 2 wb plus wand to midas build (3 wb if enemy is not spell spammer, ignoring wand) and then travels or mael (mael if you need to fight early, travels if u focus on farm, because travels will stop you from spending gold on TPs, which saves you a lot of gold before you get maelstrom) also i get mjo before any other item because of its attack speed and active ability is insanely good. The rest of items can be changed, while manta and sb is %90 buy for me)

i dont know about wb mael treads build, arc feels dead slow without midas, and if you go further by not buying travels, you are missing a lot of splitpush potential and farm.

i never built necro either so i cant tell if its good or not.

2- my control groups are:

Main arc is on 1

Tempest is on 2

Manta illusions are on 3

Illusion rune illusions are on 4

as i said i never built necro so i dont have control group for them, i choose tempest and myself (or together with illusions) with mouse.

3- i dont use tab, i always used 1-2-3-4... for swapping between units. The combo is flux + tempest + flux + 2x spark wraith, or tempest + 2x flux + 2x spark wraith

4- i got an ""outdated"" [guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1799570452) if you are interested, most of things still apply on current patch aswell."
learndota2,fqe3n3x,t1_fqe2h6w,1589301217.0,"> The shield doesn't stack, as far as I know

According to DATOHLEONG (a youtuber making dota 2 guides) it does stack, if you manage to hit 5 enemy heroes with  shield twice its more than 1000 physical damage shield, if enemy has meepo or arc warden it can even be more depending on situation.

You are most likely not going to hit everyone with the shield, but even if you manage to hit up to 3 heroes the silence and shield is still nice."
learndota2,fqe2zve,t3_gic9ky,1589300917.0,"There is a lot of things, and they change from role to role.

1- last hitting

2- laning knowledge (like planting tree in ground then eating it with tango, clearing creep wave before going for rune, putting hp/mana items on backpack or ground before regenerating etc.)

3- creep equilibrium

4- decision making (building correct items depending on game, knowing when to fight and when to run, knowing when to push or get back)

5- positioning, getting caught of position can change the course of game

6- reflexes, like dodgin spells with mk s mischief, sleight, dissimilate, imagine you dodge a black hole or chrono, that can literally turn a game around

7- general knowledge (everything about game, like how much hp one point of str gives, in which minutes does creep waves respawns, how long it takes for roshan to respawn, how long does juggernauts spin does last, how long tornado lifts for at 4 quas level etc.)

8- drafting knowledge (what hero counters what, what hero is the best to choice there, what hero is an instant win for my team that enemy prays to me not to pick it?)

and so more on, there can be many more examples which makes you superior to your enemies, but the most important part is to apply everything you know in your games, rather than just keeping them in your mind like it wouldnt make difference if you never known either."
learndota2,fqe14ht,t1_fqdeqpd,1589300037.0,"Orchid gives attack damage and mana regeneration which void spirit loves, and its deals extra damage at the end of its duration based on the damage dealt during orchid, since void spirit can nuke enemies down orchid fairly increases damage output on a single target, while aghanim can apply area silence, gives other stats than intelligence, give more shield (assuming you use it twice, shields stacks), it really depends on the game."

TrueDoTA2,fpcwen0,t3_gcquw7,1588514451.0,"the higher your attack speed is, less effective it is, because it caps at 600 (or 700 not sure) and after like 250-300 attack speed attack speed items give significiantly less amount of attack cd reduction, while damage has no cap and you can get as much damage as you want.

about your question, 200 damage and 100 attack speed is overally better than 100 damage and 200 attack speed, because 200 damage is double of 100 damage, but 200 attack speed isn't really double of 100 attack speed in terms of attack cd reduction per attack speed.

however it really about the hero you play, like if you playing juggernaut, you want 100 attack damage 200 attack speed more than 200 attack damage 100 attack speed since your ulti scales with attack speed and you can proc crits more often with attack speed (while crit damage scaling with attack damage, its not really true its only for attack speed though), but if you are playing a hero like ember spirit, you don't really rely on right clicking targets on fights but using sleight more often, so 200 damage is an absolutely better choice.
