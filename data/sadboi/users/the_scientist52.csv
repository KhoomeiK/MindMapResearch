A lot of people point out that the show was heavily edited to portray more drama than was actually there, meaning that behind the scenes Melissa's relationship with Mackenzie could have looked better.  I'm sure that played some role, but Melissa just seemed so neglectful of Mackenzie's needs and feelings--it's hard to believe that the producers could've orchestrated *all* of it.  The entire thing just gave me such a weird vibe and watching it made me uncomfortable.

I also didn't say that it doesn't matter to the plot at all.  I think some backstory does help, as I said, but there wasn't a need to devote an entire episode to it right in the middle of plotlines that were already moving along.  It should have been integrated better.

AskWomen,fr3tkps,t3_gmhg72,1589865888.0,"I'm still friends with one of mine.  Honestly our romantic relationship was more of a glorified friendship anyway as we were never a great match for each other.  We didn't have much physical intimacy either.  So going back to being friends wasn't much of a change from where things were before, except that it felt better to not have the pressure of trying to make a romantic relationship work.  We got along okay while dating but I think it was even better afterward because we weren't trying to label anything. 

We were in college at the time so we hung out the same amount, still went to events together, etc.  It was nice.  It's been a while since we graduated so we don't see each other often but we still text occasionally.  I think that being better matched as friends, plus the fact that our breakup was a mutual ""yeah we really just aren't right for each other,"" helped us naturally fall back into a friendship."
StrangerThings,fr3sykw,t3_gmh5bk,1589865408.0,"I'll be honest, I've actually never watched Lost Sister aside from a couple of minutes here and there.  I was told by a friend that it ruined the flow of the show and that I wouldn't need to watch it to understand the rest of the plot, so I just skipped it.  

I'm still not sure what the writers were thinking with that episode.  It seemed to come out of left field in general, though maybe a little bit of backstory does help somehow.  But I would agree with your assertion that much of the episode's content didn't need to be there.  

I think that like you said, it would've been better to have that storyline be spliced in with the others.  Dedicating an entire episode to it feels way off considering that it doesn't help with the plot *that* much, plus it messes with the rest of the episode flow.  It would be better to let the Hawkins stories continue on during the sister arc.  Having everything disrupted for that one episode doesn't make any sense to me."

All of the things that used to make it interesting--the variety of cases, the larger cast with more perspectives, the plot twists that are shocking yet believable--are long gone.

AskWomen,fqwa1gi,t3_gl8v9z,1589697287.0,"As someone with anorexia, I find them to be triggering.  However, I also think that they're generally unhelpful to everyone.  They perpetuate the focus on physical appearance that's the driving force behind so many perfectly healthy men and women feeling badly about themselves.  People sometimes sprinkle in a random sentence about how they ""have so much more energy now"" or whatever to make it seem like their focus is on health, but I think it's clear that weight and/or body shape are what they're usually caring about.  It's also hard for me because I think many people who are dramatically altering their body aren't doing so in a healthy and balanced way.  This is especially true for ""fitness influencers"" who are at the gym every day and won't eat a bite of processed food no matter what.  That level of obsession isn't mentally healthy for anyone and it just isn't a good thing to be promoting.  It's also hard for me because a lot of those people were perfectly healthy before but decided to make a ""lifestyle change"" so that they can look more toned--which again, perpetuates the idea that physical health isn't enough and appearance is what's important.

As a disclaimer, I obviously know that my statements are generalizations and that they don't apply to every single person.  I also support the idea of people celebrating what they've worked hard for.  It's just that when those things are the result of unhealthy actions, and when they're broadcast for the world to see, I think they can be harmful.  What happened to celebrating with close friends/family?  And when did we lose focus on what true health actually is?"

This describes my experience perfectly!  I think a lot of people recognize the benefits of not having someone to compete with, while not recognizing the positives of having a sibling around."
AskWomen,fqvst3c,t3_gkwjqd,1589684376.0,"I'm an only child.  Growing up I had a really close relationship with my parents, especially my mom.  I also always felt more comfortable around adults than around peers my own age, which I think is the result of spending so much time around parents and their friends.  To this day I get along better with people who are 10+ years older even though I'm an adult as well.

My parents definitely spoiled me.  They went above and beyond, but I think that all only children naturally get an element of it because there just aren't other kids to have to compete with.  My parents didn't have to buy clothes for 3 kids, so all of the money they had available for clothes was spent on me.  I got to choose our vacation destinations and what we did during those vacations.  I didn't have a sibling trying to say that they didn't want to go to Disney World.  If I wanted to go, that's just where we went.  Even as an adult I feel like I struggle with being selfish at times because I'm used to getting my way and I rarely had to compromise.  It's something I've been working on and am planning to continue addressing because it's my responsibility to become a better person.

As I mentioned before, I get along better with people who are older than I am.  I've always struggled to have close relationships with peers.  I'm quiet and shy which is my natural personality, but I believe it was exacerbated by not having other kids in my house.  I just didn't get the experience.  I also was very good at keeping myself entertained with games, tv, etc. so I didn't feel super lonely but later into my teenage years, it started to hit.  My family was going through a lot and it was hard for me to not have siblings who were going through the same thing.  I always felt like it I did have a sibling, we could've supported each other.  But instead I had to deal with a lot by myself and those issues have affected me to this day.  

All in all, I wish I'd had a sibling.  Most of my friends were jealous of me when we were growing up but I think being an only child ended up being more detrimental than beneficial.  I wouldn't have done well in a large family but having one sibling would've been really good for me."
dancemoms,fqvg4kn,t3_gkvrxh,1589676549.0,"Wow.  I was never a fan of Jojo but recently gained a lot of respect for her when I saw how responsibly she’s handling quarantine.  Then this happens. 

As many others have said, the show made the girls famous, not Abby herself.  And even if Abby did every ounce of the work, it wouldn’t matter.  Abuse is abuse.  I won’t try to speak for any of the girls but in my own life, I’ve achieved success with help from an emotionally abusive parent—and honestly I’d trade that success away in a heartbeat if it would’ve spared me from the abuse that’s going to affect me for the rest of my life.  Success is great but when your mental health is permanently damaged, it doesn’t mean so much.  I’m sure the girls appreciate their fame but let’s all remember that fame isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and that these girls are still affected horribly to this day. 

And as others have touched on as well, I think Jojo had a different experience than the OG girls.  The OGs dealt with Abby’s abuse and manipulation for a lot longer and from a younger age.  Jojo shouldn’t have been mistreated either but I think that when she joined the show she probably had a better understanding of what she was getting into and how the show thrived off of drama.  She seemed to be able to let it roll off her back more easily than the OGs who appeared to have internalized a lot of it after literally growing up in an environment that they weren’t expecting to.  

If Jojo wants to maintain contact with Abby, she has every right.  And if she truly does feel positively about the relationship then I’m happy for her.  But she definitely doesn’t have the right to judge anyone else’s responses to what happened on the show, especially when she didn’t have the same experience as them.  She also needs to learn that an abuser is owed nothing and that it’s beyond reasonable for the others to refuse to accept that toxicity into their lives anymore."

StrangerThings,fqrrsiq,t3_gjxcha,1589590530.0,"Mike and Eleven's relationship in S3 bothered me so so much.  The overall theme of a ton of different relationships seemed off to me too, as if the writers switched genres altogether.  In S1 and S2 we had a sci-fi thriller, in S3 we had a teen drama.  In the earlier seasons I really liked the subtlety of the relationships and how we got to watch them slowly grow/evolve.  They were there but rather than detracting from the plot, they were a nice contribution to it.  Very realistic and didn't go overboard.  Then S3 came along and suddenly almost everyone was paired into a relationship.  Among the teens, the actual friendships that we'd grown to love were pushed aside in favor of all of these separate couples and it just felt...cheap.  I think the writers could've shown the relationships progressing in a more delicate, subtle way.  

But back to Mike and Eleven.  You're right, they had the makings of a different/deeper relationship but in S3 they were turned into your average annoying middle school couple.  I think they were trying to show Eleven coming into her own a little bit more but to me her personality seemed to shift quite a bit, and I was annoyed."

StrangerThings,fqro1sa,t3_gk7gjw,1589588280.0,"I haven't gotten to season 3 during my rewatch yet so I can't remember the exact storylines or what information the Scoops Troop provided to the team.  That said, I agree about them feeling like a detriment to the overall show.  I liked the Dustin/Steve friendship, thought Erica had a few funny lines, and thought Robin's character was written well--but, putting them all together and keeping them that way for so long didn't make sense.  It speaks to the larger reason that I wasn't as much of a fan of season 3:  they were all split off into their teams and there wasn't as much interaction between them.  We saw a little of that in season 2, when Nancy and Jonathan went off alone to visit Murray, but it got a lot worse in season 3.  I don't mind a little cast expansion (I enjoy some of the new characters) but I think that when doing that, the writers ended up with too many people to try to weave into the story.

So all of that's to say that I would've much rather had the Scoops Troop people involved in other parts of the storyline instead of doing their own separate thing.  Especially because, as other commenters have said, the entire underground Russian base thing felt very outlandish and like something you'd see on Scooby-Doo.  Obviously the whole show is science fiction so we have to suspend some disbelief but in the earlier seasons (especially season 1), they made us believe that the weird things actually *were* happening.  However in season 3, the Scoops Troop storyline felt too over the top."

From what I've heard from others, it can be helpful or harmful depending on each person.  I think that occasional use is similar to having an occasional drink--it's a way to relax or take the edge off.  However, most of my friends who do use it are what I would consider dependent, which to me is very unhealthy.  Just as being dependent on alcohol would be.  

Frequent use of drugs to deal with emotions means that you aren't having the opportunity to use truly healthy coping skills, like journaling, discussing problems with a support person, or challenging negative beliefs.  Numbing the pain doesn't make it go away and relying on marijuana results in people not knowing how to actually handle emotions.  Then when the time comes that the person doesn't have access to the drug or otherwise can't use it, they're in a world of hurt because they can't deal with their problems in a healthy way.

I also hated Stabler's exit, too, and felt that it did him no justice.  Barba's was a disaster as well in my opinion.  And I second what another poster said about Sister Peg!  My heart ached after watching that.  

It seems to me that SVU doesn't do a good job of giving people respectful exits..."
criminalminds,fqjt1dm,t3_gjaszg,1589414774.0,"On the one hand, I think the idea is to show what Reid has battled during his life as a way to inform how his character is now.   I also think that showing a young person taking care of a parent is good in that it brings awareness to people who are living that situation in real life.  It isn't talked about on TV much.

However, I did think that they overdid it and took away from some other character development that could've been there.  I would've liked to have known more about his life outside of work rather than the mom issues being our main glimpse into his character.  I also found the mom storylines to be boring, probably because it was a topic that was visited pretty frequently.  I would've preferred them bringing his mom in every so often without having that be a main focus for his character."

AskWomen,fqj9i1p,t3_giulvj,1589406869.0,"I was a sophomore in high school.  There was a guy I'd had a crush on back in second grade because he seemed to like me too (lol) and throughout the years I'd always thought he was still a really nice guy.  I was never one for major crushes so I didn't really pursue him, but it was more of a ""if he happened to ask me out I'd definitely say yes.""  Unfortunately he ended up being much more popular than I was and I rarely saw him, so I knew nothing would ever happen.

That year, we ended up both going on a trip to a national convention.  Only 11 kids went from our school and I was thrilled when I found out that he was going to be one of them.  And of course, I basked in every opportunity to talk to him after not being around him much for several years.  One day we were at Disneyland in line for one of the roller coasters that sat 2 people to a car.  I happened to be standing near him and calculated that I could end up being assigned to the same car as he was if I positioned myself right.  So I spent the next 30+ minutes making sure that I was right with him and not letting anyone else get in between us or shift the group, even when he would be having conversations with other friends.  It was definitely even more awkward than it sounds lol.  It ended up working though!  Of course nothing else ended up happening with our ""relationship"" but those 2 minutes on the roller coaster together were the highlight of my trip haha"
AskWomen,fqj7ixa,t3_gitqjc,1589406107.0,"I mean, I feel like at age 18 people should know better than to not do blatantly stupid/dangerous things.  You don't need experience to know that you shouldn't drive while drunk, that illegal drugs can hurt you, or that you can/will get in trouble for committing a crime.  

To me, those things are different from honest mistakes that some young adults make, like budgeting difficulties or staying in a relationship that isn't right for them.  Experience helps with those things so it's reasonable to expect that someone who's new to a situation might not have the hang of it yet.  There isn't a specific age cutoff because someone who's 19 may have more experience in some areas than someone who's 25.  I think that by the time you're in your mid-20s you've hopefully had enough overall experience to make more intelligent decisions, but it won't be the exact same for everyone."
AskWomen,fqj5udd,t3_gizac1,1589405456.0,Politics being brought into everything and people turning some random topic into a political discussion.  They aren't usually respectful discussions either--usually there's some sort of name-calling or attacking the other side's point of view in a way that isn't helpful.  I see enough of that on FB and other news sites and I want to be able to talk about TV shows I like without it turning into something political.
AskWomen,fqj3b8y,t3_gj6sk4,1589404472.0,"I split my time between classes and working in a research lab.  There's a bit of flexibility with what time my days start/end but it's usually about 35 hours a week.  I struggle to even do that and outside of work, I have almost no energy to do anything else.  I go grocery shopping when I need to and occasionally get together with friends (we work together so we already get to socialize during business hours), but that's about it.  

When I was a kid I was always a ball of energy but since puberty I've struggled a lot.  Some of it may be related to a medical condition but regardless it's really hard for me to wonder if I'll ever have energy like a normal person.

Honestly it does make me a little sad sometimes to be missing out, but my closest friends enjoy doing things outside of just heading to the bars so I still find plenty of other things to do with them.  They're also pretty understanding about my desire to avoid bars (I don't think they're surprised based on my shyness lol) and it is what it is.

AskWomen,fqg70d4,t3_gilzs2,1589339331.0,"My experience was a bit different because I only had a roommate for one semester.  The rest I had medical documentation and was able to have my own single room.

That said, I absolutely loved living in a dorm.  It's strange because I'm very shy/quiet but for some reason, I liked having so many people nearby.  It made me feel safer because I felt like if anything happened, there were people who I could at least ask for help.  The security was pretty tight at the dorms too so I didn't feel like there would be random people prowling around.  I also liked the convenience of living right on campus.  I went to a small school so my dorm was only 5 minutes away from even the farthest classroom building.  It was easy to pop back over to my room between classes even if I didn't have a very long break.  And I never ended up forgetting homework or anything but I felt good knowing that if I did, I could run back to my room and get it without it being too big of a deal. 

The only thing I didn't like was sharing a laundry room, because they only had 4 washers/dryers for a building of like 200 people.  Trying to actually get my laundry done was a nightmare but I somehow got through it lol and I still think dorm living was 100% worth it."

AskWomen,fqg5i9t,t3_ginmy7,1589338416.0,"I don't think anyone should avoid talking about themselves in a conversation.  The key is to make sure that each person gets to share equally.  If you have a particular story to share that relates well to the topic, go for it.  Don't bring up every single thing that comes to mind, but don't feel like it's wrong to say something about yourself if it's relevant.  Just make sure to ask the other person some questions too!  

Honestly, people aren't judging every second of a conversation.  As long as you don't go *totally* overboard in either direction, the other person is going to walk away feeling just fine.  Don't put too much pressure on yourself."
SVU,fqfzr32,t3_ginza7,1589334960.0,"I've wondered that too.

AskWomen,fqe95yf,t3_gic04u,1589303779.0,"For me, I like to have a good amount in common with a partner.  I've dated guys in the past who had vastly different interests and though they were kind people, those relationships never lasted long.  So shared interests are important.  

However, I think it's also healthy to have hobbies/interests completely separate from each other.  Those things give you time to either spend alone or with other friends which is so important too.  Not to mention the fact that doing things that bring joy is a necessary part of a happy life!  No one should be expected to give up something they enjoy unless it's legitimately dangerous or damaging to the partner.  If my partner had an intense, time-consuming interest in something that I didn't like at all, I would know that they just aren't the person for me and wouldn't ask them to give up the hobby.

My main issue would be if my partner was disrespectful about my hobby, like calling it stupid or not even wanting to talk about it.  Conversely, if he said ""that isn't something I'm really interested in doing, but I love that you enjoy it"" that would be more than okay.  I would hope that he might have a few things that I'm not much part of as well."

I honestly think being a woman helped me because colleges and grad schools want to look good/diverse and that means making sure to have enough women.  I would rather have gotten in purely on merit and maybe that was the only reason, but I do think that women were more sought after, at least.  I also found that in both undergrad and grad school there were actually more women than men in my program.

dancemoms,fqe0fjr,t3_gictns,1589299705.0,"I don't see anything wrong with either option.  The trophies are a symbol of **a lot** of hard work spanning several years, so it makes perfect sense to want to keep them all.  At the same time, maybe those awards bring back memories of a time the kids would rather forget, since it seems like most, if not all, of them (especially the OG girls) had a traumatic experience on the show.  Or I could see if dance isn't really an important part of their lives anymore, maybe they feel neutral about the trophies so throwing them away isn't a huge deal.  Either way I think they each have the right to decide what's best for them and their families.  And I'm glad that for those who may struggle a lot with the past, they have the strength to get rid of something that could trigger negative memories.

If it were me, I would probably choose some sort of middle ground of keeping the trophies in a box in the garage or something.  I wouldn't be totally getting rid of them in case one day down the road I wanted to look back on them or show them to my kids, but I also wouldn't have to constantly be reminded of them either.  But that's just what I feel I would do in that situation, and I see nothing wrong with choosing one of the other options."
GERD,fqdngy9,t1_fqdm4s4,1589293217.0,"It really depends.  For some people, taking the PPI for a short time works out okay.  It calms things down and lets any damage heal, and then the person can maintain progress through diet/lifestyle changes.  They just need a little boost to get things under control.  Other people end up needing the med longer-term because symptoms return too badly when trying to stop.  I'll be honest--it does happen that way for quite a few people, which is to me one of the biggest problems facing GERD treatment right now.  So you're definitely right in that it isn't a perfect solution.   However long-term use isn't so dangerous that it shouldn't be tried at all, in my opinion.

We have no way of knowing which group you'll fall into, so I still think it's worth doing.  The way I see it is that you're so miserable right now that you need to try something else.  Focus on getting things under control for the time being then worry about the rest later, which is a strategy I have to use a lot with my own medical problems."

It's probably hard for your friends and family to know what you'd like, since sometimes people want support but other times would rather just be left alone.

I don't usually do anything about it.  I know that isolating isn't the ideal coping skill, but it feels like the healthiest for me so I ride it out until I naturally start to want to engage more.  It typically only lasts between a few days and a week, so it doesn't feel like a huge problem."
AskWomen,fqafedg,t3_ghp4nu,1589218144.0,"When I was about 11 I was at an appointment with a new psychiatrist my pediatrician recommended to help with my anxiety.  My mom was in the room with me.  For whatever reason the doctor had to do a physical as part of the evaluation so I had changed into a gown before he walked in.  After the (uneventful) exam was over, he said, ""you can put your clothes back on now"" but didn't move to leave.  I just stared at him and he kept encouraging me to get dressed with him right there, acting like it shouldn't bother me in the slightest, and it made me really uncomfortable.  I tried to say that I'd just do it later but he wouldn't let it go.  My mom was always very protective but for some reason she didn't speak up.  I think we were both a little shocked at what was going on and also confused about if it was *really* wrong--he was a doctor after all, plus she was there so what bad thing could happen?

I knew something was off but I felt ashamed of not standing up for myself more so I just excused it as someone who was ignorant about what was appropriate, but not intentionally bad.  He was also in his 50s probably so part of me thought that maybe when he was starting out that sort of thing was more acceptable?

To be honest, the situation still haunts me to this day, even though it isn't what anyone would consider a big deal.  I think I'm still confused because looking back he seemed really creepy for doing that but at the same time, nothing bad came of it so I feel like I'm overreacting."

I will say that while I sometimes *feel* entitled, I don't act like it.  With others I'm respectful and considerate, and I've always worked hard in school or at my job.  I would still like to work on the mindset though.  I want to find a balance with not feeling entitled but also knowing that I'm a worthy person who deserves respect.
