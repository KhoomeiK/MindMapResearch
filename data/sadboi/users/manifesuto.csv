Yeah but presumably they chose to own a business because that’s what they wanted to do? There are pros and cons to every career path and you have to choose the trade-off that’s right for you. People who own a business value the freedom and the feeling of building something for themselves. I just don’t understand why people complain about something that was their choice. If they don’t want to deal with risk, they could have chosen a less risky path, no?"

rupaulsdragrace,fom56el,t1_fojfmvw,1587878633.0,I like the way Jackie handled the question. The situation with Mercedes was a bit weird because she advertised herself as the first Muslim queen on RPDR but then on the show was really uncomfortable when religion was discussed.

exmuslim,folz6ig,t3_g86bhk,1587874052.0,"Watched the episode last night and was wondering if this was going to pop up on the sub lol

Obviously Jeff Goldblum isn’t wrong about the issues in Islam but at the same time there was just something about the way he said it that came off as ignorant. Just as many of the people outraged by this are non-Muslim white people who should stay out of it, doesn’t the same argument apply here? The way he asked it just rubbed me the wrong way, idk. 

Anyways I probably shouldn’t have expected a deeply nuanced discussion from a tv show lol. 

I really wish Jackie had said more, because she of all people would be the right person to say it, but I understand she had to be careful because saying anything even mildly against Islam would hurt her career and probably even offend her own family. Notice she avoided saying Islam directly, when she answered the question she said “middle east”. Her response was very wishy washy. 

Another Muslim queen in a past season seemed really uncomfortable when asked about Islam. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of these queens had feelings of cognitive dissonance or misgivings about religion but couldn’t really say anything. Or even other LGBTQ Muslim-background celebrities like Tan France. 

Also, major eye roll towards Ru being like “There are so many different layers to this presentation. If it was ever going to be done, this is the stage to do it” but wouldn’t let Manila wear her period dress in All Stars."
