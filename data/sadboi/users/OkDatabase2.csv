Regardless of your actions:

They need to feel as if they are ""in charge"" ""in power"" by trying to breed fear in you.

They don't realize that giving you all of this attention/rage/anger, is actually breeding more fear and uncertainty in themselves. As someone just posted.

I have corporate cyberbullies/stalkers. One of them posted from another platform that they have people working/harassing,  24/7 online.  (She inadvertently exposed their tactics and practices)..

This gave me a good chuckle.  When you have a **whole corporation/franchise/network** *working that hard* because they feel that threatened over one individual?  Just one.

They are utilizing a lot of power, money, time and resources.

I grew up in an impoverished area, and never heard of Shakespeare until about 7th grade.  Our English/Literature teacher brought in a set of albums, and played them on an old record player.  33 rpm..

The play was the audio version of *MacBeth?*  She had the rapt attention of every single one of the students in that class.  To the point, she brought out old Shakespearean play-books.  There weren't enough to go around, so we shared.

She was well-versed on the characters, their emotional/mental makeup, the history of Shakespeare, himself, and his insightful clarity, wit at that time period, and  human nature.

It seemed that pretty much every single story ever written, or movie ever directed, or song ever sung - goes back to Shakespeare, and his predecessors.

bullying,ey32tt1,t3_cu2l9r,1566754001.0,"Thanks for your story and sharing it.:)

Mine is kind of like yours but a little different.  I saw my cyber bullies in person. Daily.  They were the personal trainers, sales people, front desk personnel at my gym.  It's actually a fitness franchise.

It all started out with one personal trainer, who, for the life of him, did not like being ignored - in person.  I'm an introvert, and just wanted to work out, speak to whomever i chose to, make gains. (And yeah, i'm a girl)..

Gym members and employees would act out in groups, anyway they wished. But if i retaliated in any subtle way - they were offended.

Members who've also been harassed there, exposed them on the internet, just as i have.  But those same members always ran after placing their reviews. (Or probably were targeted and bullied).

I decided to stick around and see if there would be any improvement, after i placed mine.

Long story short, it seems it went from individual harassment, to a group,  to group facility, to meetings, conferences on the administrative levels probably up to the CEO. I literally saw them in a conference for damage control.  I wouldn't have known it until i saw the front desk manager, who looked dead at me, then ducked down behind the nearby desk when i walked past the admin. folks meeting right there in the lobby.

It was interesting to research and observe over a year of harassment and bullying tactics, that gym lost personnel, clients, friends, etc., just to get at *one* individual.  A person that the majority of these folks didn't know.  But were happy to take their frustrations/insecurities out on anyway.

*They just went along with it because it was fun - that was it.*

Whelp.. one day, i stood up to that one personal trainer, who instigated all that mess. Finally looking him in the face and calling him on crap, was interesting.

I felt sorry for him.  That smug grin was wiped off his face, and i saw him for what he was.  He was just a kid - (even though he looked like he was in his early 40s).  And not very intelligent, with his mouth swung open.  But what really amazed me, was this *kid* could influence a large group of  supposedly adults, (gym members/personal trainers) to the point they believed him, and without question - gleefully, acted out in groups.  People aged from mid 30's to late early 70's, from the looks of them. Some of them supposedly ""role models"" for *their* kids.

The *online* silliness started with their sales personnel, who's job is to also suppress anything on the internet to keep their company looking squeaky clean.  The moment i posted a little of my experience here on Reddit, there she was, like tRump on Twitter..  From that moment on, there was an online harassment campaign to shut me down, telling the mods here on Reddit that i was a shill.  Right now, her, the clients, relatives, co-workers and the watch dogs for that corporation are still working furiously on Tumblr, flooding my feed with some interesting memes. :)

Just looking that kid in the eye, was enough for to realize it wasn't worth my time, going there.  It worked i my favor, somehow.  I did get a chance to finally come out of my shell as an introvert. And met some really cool people with whom i'll stay in contact with.

But i will say, the whole experience was truly eye opening, and i am so thankful for this lesson.  I was able to observe firsthand - the lengths, people will go to keep their jobs, protect their egos/insecurities, and how far corporations will go to cover their as\*\*.

The ones i finally opened up to, were so welcoming, and many of them knew what an introvert was, but once they saw me being witty, silly, a really good listener, etc., even they would say i was an extrovert.

Get me around cliques/gangs/mean girls/guys/groups - i will shut down faster than Trump can tweet.

It all depends on whom we are around."
intj,ety73dc,t3_cdxub1,1563314070.0,"Same boat, and yep, i think this is something we do intuitively.

Observe, don't react, expose them without being emotional - and watch the bullies suddenly become the victims.

And it's even more interesting to observe when you put out the fake clues.

One incident, still gives me a chuckle.  A young lady worked at the front desk at our gym tried to befriend me - and was pretty aggressive about it. I found it had nothing to do with friendship.  She was trying to make money for the gym and their personal training service/referrals.  She did discuss what it was like working the front desk with the other 30 somethings, staff/administrators, and from what i gathered, it's not pleasant.  Her main complaint?

""They were the most two-faced people she'd ever met in her entire life, especially the manager"".  I knew this, which was why i never said one word around them.  But i also wanted to see where i stood *with her.*

So, i walked up while she was standing next to the manager.  He pretended to be folding towels while listening in. I spoke very low, yet just enough for him to bend down, and pause between the towel folding and I put it out there, and *in a very mocking, high pitched tone.*

And afterwards said, the infamous words that will put your personal business out on CNN w/in 30 seconds:

***""Don't tell anyone i said this""..***

As sure as a turd sticks to a blanket.. The next morning i walked in?  A clerk started reciting the very same thing *repeatedly* while she *scanned me in -* in that very same mocking voice.  I didn't react, but i noticed?  The front desk manager was looking dead at my face for clues of irritation.  He didn't get what he was looking for, and as i walked off - he was mouthing off to his buddies like nobody's business.

At one point, he would try to make eye contact, bug his eyes really wide, clench his teeth and say it to make the others laugh.  

When i would leave the gym, they would repeat the phrase in that same high-pitched tone, and laugh their as\*\* off as if they were really doing something special.  I'm serious.  The females were actually doubling over with laughter trying to really bring it home, that they ""were getting my goat""..

If other gym members were around?  Of course, they reeled it in..

And yeah, the female employee who claimed everyone else was 2-faced, couldn't help herself - and started doing the same thing to prove her loyalty to her buddies. I put distance between us immediately.

It was interesting? But just another learning experience.

Glad you kept your cool, professionalism, maturity, keeping your wits about you, and yes, you're my f\*\*cking hero!!! Kudos!!  :)"

Anxiety,etrw6af,t1_etpywu3,1563130447.0,"I agree..

What i found interesting?

There's an archived thread about a mod who was being constantly harassed by one member under several accounts. (Down voted, negative comments and PM'd) years ago.

When Reddit members had the same problem and needed help, they were sent an automatic, (Just ignore/block the member).

But when it happened that mod - i was actually surprised at how much it hurt them to get randomly downvoted, or having someone post something mean spirited or random where ever they posted.

When i saw that? I realized even the watchers of reddit get it as well.  We all get it in the long run.."
Anxiety,etrv3ke,t1_etq4lqf,1563129743.0,"Happened to me too..

I said something really positive in a forum and someone stated, they didn't like my sarcasm...

totally blown away.. Just being honest here.  

My first reaction was: ""Damn! Who lit the string to your tampon?""

After that, you realize,  yep.. Reddit is definitely the *""front page""* of the internet.  When you post, you're open to everyone's issues/agendas. Anonymity just magnifies it.

Even more ironic? I see people are actually internet/reddit trolls/harassers *in person*, almost everyday.

All i can say is.. yep - they have every reason to be bitter, and they gotta project it some where.  The internet is just *ONE* place.  Guess what it must be like in their households, as well as the workplace?

And as people stated, it's nothing personal.  Just stick with us positive folks. :)"

Someone taught me something pretty simple to get out of it.. It might not bring ""happiness""? But it helps take the edge off when our minds start flying a million miles an hour.

Breathe.  Take in a deep breath for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and let it out slowly for  4 seconds.
