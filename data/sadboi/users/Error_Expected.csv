I will say that there are a couple of reasons why some of our behaviour seems like narc traits. First, whenever we get dysregulated, we chase distractions. Hard. That can be sex, substances, and a number of other problematic issues. It's almost mania-like. We also hide our intense emotions because we were convinced as children that feeling things = weakness. Which can also seem narc.

Secondly, a lot of us were raised by narcissists ourselves. This can cause ""fleas"" - traits you adopt from your parents.
