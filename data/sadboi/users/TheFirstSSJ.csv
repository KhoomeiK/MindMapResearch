borderlands3,fqefj50,t1_fqefd53,1589306707.0,Honestly the 200% action skill more than makes up for it. Still wait out-dpsing my non annointed *2
borderlands3,fptd89r,t3_gf8aw3,1588889123.0,They really should extend the event since players like me (and I believe others exist) aren't motivated to play it for next to no reward every time.
Seaofthieves,fpr3ydx,t1_fpr3xkg,1588841518.0,Keep wasting your time lol
Seaofthieves,fpr3vem,t1_fpr3s6a,1588841434.0,Hey bud I made this post to waste your time. Newsflash
Seaofthieves,fpr3ijq,t1_fpr3gsu,1588841071.0,I literally cannot control connection instability are you delusional?
Seaofthieves,fpr383t,t1_fpr35dg,1588840784.0,Yeah I think I'll just quit the game like 75% of people who download it. Then you guys can play your dead game and do the same shit with no reward daily
Seaofthieves,fpr362w,t1_fpr34m4,1588840727.0,You said 30 crew channels you dumb fuck
Seaofthieves,fpr351u,t1_fpr33fb,1588840698.0,But emissaries are pointless.
Seaofthieves,fpr2yyg,t1_fpr2x2p,1588840526.0,Then I don't get the ship set that I want due to a disadvantage I can't control
Seaofthieves,fpr2xvb,t1_fpr2wft,1588840498.0,There's no point in hunting if it just gets stolen
Seaofthieves,fpr2tsh,t1_fpr2t2c,1588840385.0,And no more loot to steal
Seaofthieves,fpr2t0p,t1_fpr2qy8,1588840364.0,"I mean literally no dude, I can't do anything about people camping reapers hideout for when I'm turning in loot and I can't fight back."
Seaofthieves,fpr2oq6,t1_fpr2lob,1588840247.0,"You can still fight skeletons with lag issues, that isn't difficult. They have predictable movements that they always make. Also a lot of Xbox players have lag"
Seaofthieves,fpr2lrq,t1_fpr2gwb,1588840163.0,"You're straight up lying though, there's 8 crews on the community discord with most being 2 mans. There's about 20 people on proving my point. Also you said 11 crews averaging 3 people a crew, in what world is (11*3)>50?"
Seaofthieves,fpr2h36,t1_fpr2ffs,1588840032.0,Not in my current arrangement
Seaofthieves,fpr2gl8,t1_fpr2dkf,1588840018.0,"I mean, no it literally wouldn't. Those people would play on the PvP servers and can fight each other as much as they want."
Seaofthieves,fpr2duv,t1_fpr2d6n,1588839943.0,"I am, and a lot of Xbox players have lag issues"
Seaofthieves,fpr27v4,t1_fpr25gm,1588839782.0,"My whole point is that I'd like the reapers ship set because it looks cool, and I can't do it because the game locks certain content behind PvP. That's lame for Xbox players bc most of us can't PvP due to lag"
Seaofthieves,fpr24pz,t1_fpr236r,1588839698.0,I'm just tired of losing all the loot I just farmed bc someone shows up and I know I can't win.
Seaofthieves,fpr22tg,t1_fpr21e7,1588839645.0,"And as I said I'm an Xbox player with lag, so I play peacefully."
Seaofthieves,fpr20xj,t1_fpr1zkp,1588839594.0,My main issue is I play on Xbox with lag
Seaofthieves,fpr2073,t1_fpr1ufp,1588839573.0,"75% of players that have played this game have quit it. That alone would tell me it's a dead game. On top of that, there's never more than 50 people looking for a crew in the official discord at once."
Seaofthieves,fpr1vx4,t1_fpr1qo6,1588839454.0,I can't do that as an Xbox player with connection issues. I'm forced to match with PC players even with the preference on.
Seaofthieves,fpr1u71,t1_fpr1pjs,1588839406.0,"Yes, I am flying the reapers emissary because I want to get the set at level 75. I'm from the US and I just think you should be able to get it as a sloop player."
Seaofthieves,fpr1oq9,t1_fpr1m3r,1588839256.0,Did you miss the part where I have extreme lag issues? I can't PvP at all and I'd like to solo sloop at times while working towards my goal of 75 reapers
Seaofthieves,fpr1ku4,t1_fpr1hc2,1588839146.0,I just think that you should be able to enjoy the full content of the game without needing 4 players to protect your emissary loot.
Seaofthieves,fpr1ivx,t1_fpr1e32,1588839092.0,I am an Xbox player that teleports all the time due to insane lag problems. I just want to enjoy the emissary content but other players are ruining that
Seaofthieves,fpr1fgh,t1_fpr18om,1588839000.0,Yeah I mean your first paragraph is true throughout this post but in reverse. It's just negative bullshit in every comment. And I do feel that the person taking away 3 hours of my work with no counterplay and leaving me with nothing is a jerk.
Seaofthieves,fpr1aoy,t1_fpr19g8,1588838871.0,"Yes and when everyone like me quits the game, then what?"
Seaofthieves,fpr19ve,t1_fpr18iq,1588838849.0,Ah yes another one of these comments. You wonder why your game is dead.
Seaofthieves,fpr16mg,t1_fpr153o,1588838762.0,So those guys can play on the PvP servers that's kind of the point
Seaofthieves,fpr13gu,t1_fpr0zej,1588838677.0,Yeah buddy coming from the passive aggressive prick who sucks at hiding it! I'm just a little tired of every comment from you people being the same with very little variation. Unlike you I at least insult someone directly instead of trying to ride a high horse.
Seaofthieves,fpr0ydi,t1_fpr0ulv,1588838538.0,And if I want to solo sloop as an Xbox player I'm just fucked. Honestly PvE servers would invite so many people back to the game; I'd bet more than anything that getting sunk is the #1 reason behind lack of content at launch as to why people quit this game.
Seaofthieves,fpr0rlk,t1_fpr0ix1,1588838353.0,People like you are why you're game is dying ass clown
Seaofthieves,fpr0o5k,t1_fpr0d4q,1588838260.0,No asshole I'm asking to farm PvE for greater loot over time. Not to get sunk by pricks like you when I'm literally unable to counter your actions.
Seaofthieves,fpr0m49,t1_fpr0i5k,1588838205.0,God you're like a brick wall. What a waste of time; get blocked.
Seaofthieves,fpr0i3s,t1_fpr0f1o,1588838100.0,There's no point in PvE when it just gets stolen. I play on Xbox with shit ping and get matched with PC players who constantly steal even with the preference turned on.
Seaofthieves,fpr0ft6,t1_fpr0d6n,1588838039.0,?????? Your logic is so flawed. By turning in loot before getting level 5 you are losing money. That is discouragement.
Seaofthieves,fpr0aqa,t1_fpr068q,1588837903.0,"Emissaries are the best way to earn gold, and my goal is to attain the reapers ship set. I actually think it is a good idea and will stop people like me from leaving the game. People who think dividing the player base is a bad idea are the clearly biased towards the thieving playstyle"
Seaofthieves,fpr06sg,t1_fpr05tg,1588837798.0,Then what's the point of the fucking emissaries dipshit
Seaofthieves,fpr05pj,t1_fpr02ql,1588837767.0,"You said ""that's not true"" then reiterated what I said. Why PvE at all when you can just wait for other people to do it for you"
Seaofthieves,fpr007z,t1_fpqzxa1,1588837618.0,You literally are discouraged from turning in small amounts of loot with this update. It's literally a rich get richer situation
Seaofthieves,fpqzyrc,t1_fpqzv05,1588837578.0,"It's flawed because why spend time at all digging up chests or getting skulls when clearly the smart way is to just steal shit. Then when everyone has that mindset, there's nothing to steal. PvE simply isn't rewarded enough"
Seaofthieves,fpqziky,t1_fpqz9rk,1588837146.0,"It would be nice if you could have a more open mind towards my play-style. This stubbornness of saying ""you'll be sunk"" and ""it's called sea of THIEVES!!!!""; citing the same arguments while refusing to look at the fact that your game is flawed is why it's dying."
Seaofthieves,fpqz7qs,t1_fpqyu0p,1588836860.0,"I like how you went straight to insulting rather than having a reasonable opinion. You just say the name of the game and pretend everything is fine because your playstyle is rewarded.

The state of the game sucks for everyone, even you. Your playstyle of stealing from others is only alive because people like me gather loot to steal; PvE servers may not be the full answer but there needs to be better rewards for actually putting in the work of getting loot rather than just getting lucky and stealing someone's crap that they spent 3+ hours on."
Seaofthieves,fpqz2lo,t1_fpqyz6o,1588836723.0,That would honestly be fine with me; that's a lot less frustrating than dying to a player.
Seaofthieves,fpqyxqn,t1_fpqytf2,1588836593.0,No it's part of the time wasting experience. This game is poorly designed as a whole because low effort is rewarded and high effort isn't.
Seaofthieves,fpqyrtc,t1_fpoi48s,1588836433.0,Yeah this shit happens to me on Xbox as well
Seaofthieves,fpqxnj5,t3_getta6,1588835390.0,You're cringe
borderlands3,forlnnp,t3_g91n7y,1588014320.0,"I'm thinking this is lazy coding. If I had to guess, mayhem 10 was just placed in the game where there was already framework for something else, and they didn't change the drops. It being the new max level sort of hints that it may be the same drop rate as level 57 no mayhem."

AmItheAsshole,fk50cyu,t3_fgg4k4,1583871065.0,"Honestly I see a lot of YTA and I disagree with the general consensus here.

I think you should have talked with Dad, and told him you were doing it because you were tired if watching your daughter get bullied and feeling insecure. If he said no, probably do it when she turns 18 to avoid a court battle, but I don't think what you did makes you an asshole.

Reddit likes to overreact and be condescending whenever they think they can."

AmItheAsshole,fk289gl,t3_ffvnyp,1583795269.0,"NAH all these comments are going on way or the other, when in actuality you're just different people with different senses of humor who should accept each other since you're family. In laws should get the sticks out of their asses but they won't, and since they're stubborn about their behavior they should respect yours."
AmItheAsshole,fk27xzq,t3_ffvnyp,1583795066.0,Honestly brother if these people get this mad at a little joke I personally wouldn't hang around them. But if you're forced to I'd just take part in their stuffy demeanor and try to behave like the principal at school is watching you.
