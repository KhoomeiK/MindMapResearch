depression,fbif1ks,t1_fbiecan,1576899133.0,Explain your first sentence again? I’m not sure I’m following that part.
depression,fbicsy1,t3_edhcd2,1576897297.0,"Yes often. Don’t initiate plans mostly because I don’t have the energy to commit to anything. And if I do show up I’m quiet, and  nervous that I’m too boring to be there and bringing everyone down. Or that they’ll feel bad for me. I hate the pity."
depression,f9smcz3,t1_f9odq61,1575595236.0,This is too real. Ugh.
depression,exmknqd,t3_cshoh6,1566433966.0,"thank you for this. i was trying to explain this exact thing to my therapist recently and i couldn't find the words. but it's like how can i feel fine, HAPPY even, for a day - and then so dark and so shitty the next. it makes me wonder if i actually AM depressed? the fraud thing resonates for sure. and i have also asked myself if i am doing this for attention. i know i'm not but it always creeps into my mind when i'm feeling OK and takes over."
