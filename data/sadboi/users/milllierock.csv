bipolar2,f9m193r,t3_e4zo1n,1575437975.0,i only end up smoking when i’m hypomanic and it just inflates my mood even more. i will literally be bouncing off the walls and think i’m the greatest person alive. personally i try to avoid it cause i know it will either trigger or is part of a hypomanic episode.
mountainbikes,f9ivmu0,t3_e57a8g,1575347187.0,nice 👍🏼
bipolar2,f98k85n,t3_e4aqdk,1575179321.0,kudos to you! great work

bipolar,f91s9u9,t1_f90n74u,1574999650.0,happy cake day 🍰
bipolar2,f8yld5r,t3_e2vmq8,1574949103.0,yes i had the same experience. my pdoc said she was going to add an antidepressant (for me welbutrin) but didn’t so i progressively got more and more depressed before almost ending up in the hospital. after that i had IOP where i got started up on the antidepressant. the dr i had there was shocked that i wouldn’t have been on both a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for BP2. this was literally 2 months ago. everyone experiences BP2 differently but i would recommend talking to your doctor about this. even if it ends up not being serious at least you made sure.
bipolar2,f8u3et6,t3_e22j91,1574818180.0,good luck! i hope it goes well

bipolar2,f8sgtfu,t3_e1u9m4,1574780338.0,hell yeah same here. and about the dying part i’m always like “if i die at least it will be in a cool way” lol i know that’s so bad but honestly it’s so true
bipolar2,f8sgkci,t3_e1wf8c,1574780155.0,"definitely give them some space for a bit then as the other redditor said, a kind gesture would probably be welcomed. good luck!"
bipolar2,f8sgeq6,t3_e1wrel,1574780040.0,no nightmares but vivid dreams. like extremely relevant to my life. if i go to sleep thinking about something i need to do or didn’t do i’ll dream about it which is sometimes helpful for when i wake up lol. never had this before

bipolar2,f8gphgc,t3_e0ob4j,1574563177.0,i too struggle with who to tell and who not too. bottom line is if you tell someone and they push you away and are not supportive they are probably not someone to have in your life
bipolar2,f8go86e,t3_e0r5y7,1574562650.0,"i’ve never been psychotic either and i also don’t randomly spend a lot of money. i do however buy random things that i don’t really need but they aren’t expensive. also, happy cake day"

Watches,f4jt6w1,t1_f4jsnry,1571625844.0,i could only find similar not identical. small variations make all the difference. appreciate it tho
Watches,f4jsyoc,t1_f4ivjbs,1571625717.0,thank you i appreciate it! i think 97 would make more since than 80s since my uncle would have been quite young then.
Watches,f4ias3m,t1_f4i9pbk,1571601837.0,sorry you wasted your time doing what i already did! only asked for someone who actually has firsthand knowledge of this watch. not someone who knows how to type words into a google search. LOL😂😂😂
Watches,f4i9i10,t3_dkomdt,1571601462.0,please only comment if you know what this is. yes i already googled it and looked on ebay. please be more kind.

iphone,f164li1,t1_f161ks8,1569202445.0,it’s an accessibility shortcut in settings. unfortunately i am not seeing dark mode as an option for triple clicking the side button. check it out for yourself in settings->accessibility-> general->accessibility shortcut. i really wish this was something apple included with IOS 13.

BipolarReddit,f02u0or,t3_d3djiq,1568338203.0,"i would say i’m the same. i constantly sleep when depressed, like 12 hrs sometimes. but when i’m hypomanic i usually get at least 5 but more around 7. it’s really hard sometimes for me to tell the difference between being normal and hypomania unless i really do some stupid shit or feel really impulsive."
