I was an only child and I loved that part of my childhood. I spent hours locked up in my room with a word processor typing away. That's how my love of writing was born. I read a million books.

The symptoms tend to affect major aspects of the personality including one's system of meaning (loss of belief in God, for example), feeling permanently damaged or separate from others, or obsession with real or perceived abandonment. Some experts have suggested CPTSD as an alternative diagnosis for those with Borderline Personality Disorder. It is not officially recognized in the DSM, though many therapists have found it a useful approach to help victims of repeated trauma/captivity including victims of childhood abuse, domestic violence or POWs.

Has she explained why the pediatrician upsets her so much? It seems normal to me that a 12-year-old would hate the idea of a pelvic exam, but the fact that this has been an ongoing fear for years suggests something unresolved.  


If she says she wasn't abused, I would take her at her word. You've given her a safe space to come out and talk about it and that's all you can do. It's much more likely that she had a traumatic interpretation of something normal, like the way little kids scream when they have to get shots because they once had a shot that hurt really bad. If she was too young to form long-term narrative memory at the time, she may not even remember why she's having the reaction - she's just having it out of habit.

My relationship with my mother is very complicated. She was complicit in my own abuse. It's not on me to take on her trauma on top of my own. That's a lesson it took me 37 years to learn."
AskReddit,fq35wpj,t1_fq2yh0h,1589063310.0,"I have no relationship with my father. I haven't talked to him since I found out. Most rapes aren't reported, and most rapes that are reported aren't prosecuted. In this case the crime is almost 40 years old. The odds my father would go to jail for raping my mother are nonexistent. I work for a sexual assault services organization and I'm sorry to report that even those who come forward right away have little chance of seeing justice. That's why some of us are so angry."

AskReddit,fq2w9pn,t3_ggfhha,1589060477.0,"Most of my adult life has been just me plowing forward with severe PTSD. I graduated college with PTSD, got married with PTSD, finished graduate school with PTSD, where I got my first evidence-based treatment with prolonged exposure therapy. Exposure therapy permanently reduced some of my symptoms by about 90% but there were more complex emotional wounds that remained, especially around my relationship with my mother. I tackled those in my 30s with several rounds of EMDR. The effect of EMDR on my psyche has been nothing short of miraculous. That was just the catalyst for further healing.

Then I got pregnant and had a child eight weeks ago. Having a kid seems to have catapulted me into a totally different headspace. My abuse was a long time ago and sometimes it seems like it happened to someone else. Something about having a child has made it seem less relevant. I even made peace with my mother, who was one of my abusers. I guess I just realized everything I have now and everything I am would not have been without those early days of suffering. All those lessons I learned the hard way, I now get to pass onto my child. I don't regret any part of my life.

I am 37 years old."
AskReddit,fq2o6zz,t3_gggd22,1589058020.0,"My Mom was drugged and raped by my bio Dad at a party when they were 17 & 18 years old. They were dating at the time but had never had sex before. It took my Mom a long time to understand that what happened to her was rape. She told me the story when I was young and it was always sketchy (she passed out and woke up to them having sex) but she didn't tell me she was actually drugged until I was an adult - and I was the one who had to explain to her that was rape. She said her brother warned her that he'd seen my father drug her drink, but she didn't understand what he was talking about. (That my uncle failed to intervene is no surprise - he was severely mentally disturbed.) She did say my father apologized to her after she got pregnant with me. She married him but they were together less than a year. He was a terrifying drunk and she had to crawl out the 2nd story bedroom window with me in her arms to escape from him.

I've always had a frustrating and distant relationship with my father, he's a severe alcoholic who will not take responsibility for anything. My Mom isn't very stable herself and she has a tendency to revise history all the time. The thing is, I believe her because I know my Dad and it's just something his dumb ass would do. He's a fundamentally selfish person with a long history of abusive behavior. I had a tentative relationship with him as an adult and learning that just ended my desire to be around him, so I stopped returning his calls years ago. I guess I could have confronted him but I didn't see the point. I've always felt guilty for not loving my father despite his insistence that he loved me, and this helped me let go of the desire to keep our relationship going for his sake.

I have had a very difficult relationship with my mother, she was abusive and a part of me thinks she was so resentful toward me in part because of the rape."
beyondthebump,fq2ej14,t3_ggjo14,1589055375.0,"When my son was first born, I fell into a severe depression. I kept telling my husband that I wasn't capable of taking care of our baby, and he kept saying to me, ""You ARE taking care of him. You just can't see all the things you are doing.""  I think maybe you are in a similar state of mind. You're sharing duties but because of feelings of inadequacy it doesn't feel good enough. Yet what you're describing is the work of motherhood. Babies are made to cry and their discomfort is pretty much inevitable. As parents it's easy to feel inadequate when you can't fix things for your child, but some things can't be fixed. I started doing so much better when I stopped taking my son's upset personally. Babies cry. They get fussy and gassy and squirmy and sometimes they just scream and scream and nothing you do seems to make a difference. That's just part of the experience.

I didn't feel the rush of love right away either, and that's okay. I started feeling stronger feelings around four weeks and I'm smitten now at eight weeks. Some women take months to feel affection for their child. It's all normal and at this age, it's all the same to the baby. Your baby is healthy, safe, and well cared for, so you need to take care of you. Postpartum is such an insanely vulnerable time both physically and emotionally. This is a time you \*should\* be leaning harder on your partner and getting as much rest as you possibly can. I'm so glad you are going to see your doctor. Best of luck!"
beyondthebump,fq0zf5w,t3_ggc5i8,1589039626.0,"I was surprised by how relentless and overwhelming being in the hospital was. I had assumed they would be all about helping Mom recover, but no, the nurses never let me sleep and constantly pressured me about breastfeeding while bombarding me with information. He wouldn't latch and then he got jaundice because they were so reluctant to feed him formula, which just made everything worse. By the time we got home I was suicidal and thought I'd made the biggest mistake of my life. Fortunately the suicidal ideation went away once I got some sleep and decided to give up on breastfeeding.

A good thing I didn't expect was how much enjoyment I would get out of the daily feeding and changing routine, one I got the hang of it. I'm not crazy about babies in general so I thought the newborn stage would feel like endless boring drudgery, but it's not really that boring, somehow. I love cuddling that little guy and kissing his little cheeks and then when he looks into my eyes -- gah -- I'm sent!"
beyondthebump,fpy8cz0,t1_fpy6fmz,1588998275.0,I hate it too because I'm not breastfeeding at all so there's the fear of being judged and I feel like I need to explain myself. I know it's nobody's business but I am not that person who can just tell people to piss off.

I got this all the time while I was pregnant. ""How are you feeling?"" ""Terrible."" ""That's pregnancy for you!""

My son is 8 weeks and he can go 5 to 6 hours on a good day also but he's hardly sleeping through the night. That's developmentally normal. I feel okay about it, honestly, but I'm getting decent (if broken) sleep since my husband takes half of the night shift."

AskReddit,fpxg675,t3_gfnmo4,1588982062.0,"Well, it's kind of a crapshoot but you can minimize your risk by choosing the right partner. Most people don't actually change much in terms of core personality traits, especially after age twenty-five when the human brain matures. If you pick someone who is unreliable, quick to anger, who flakes out in a crisis, then that's the person you're going to be married to ten years from now. Likewise, if you pick someone who is responsible, patient, and calm in a crisis, you're likely to have that same person in ten years. This is why it's a good idea to spend a lot of time with the person you're going to commit to prior to making that commitment. By which I mean years, not months. You want enough time to really know how that person reacts to all manner of difficult situations, because life will challenge you both with some real hardships.   


For those who say relationships are hard work... maybe during the darkest times they require extra effort, but I find it's mostly effortless if you establish good and loving habits. Once those habits are second nature, you can be a good partner without having to even think about it too much. I feel like my husband and I have mostly been coasting on good habits for the better part of two decades. Loving him feels effortless to me."

Everyone put me on trial, raking me over the coals for the details, and I was forbidden from seeing my step-siblings ever again... all because I wanted to talk privately with a damned counselor.

There's something to be said for writers who can make anything their own. Look at the challenges faced by comic book writers, for example. They are told all the time what they can and can't write and they find a way to make wonderful stories even within rigid limitations. 

I guess my main point is that it's not necessarily either/or. There are things you may compromise and things you never would. There are definitely things in my books I would not compromise, but other things I would change, and I think i would even enjoy the challenge of creating a new version."
