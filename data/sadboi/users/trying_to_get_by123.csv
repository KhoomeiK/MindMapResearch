Anxiety,ex26cko,t3_cr4cyt,1565963600.0,"I really like mine and like to have it when I am going to sleep but typically when I wake up I have kicked it off during the night. It helps a lot when I am trying to fall asleep but once I am asleep I guess I don't need it anymore haha! Also, helps me a lot when I am having an attack because I like to put myself in a very small ball and be as tight as possible, and the blanket helps me feel like I am in that ball, and therefore, I calm down faster."

Anxiety,ewfkqt8,t3_cnzcs9,1565363036.0,I have the worst GI issues when my anxiety is bad. It's one of the biggest reasons I went to the doctor for my anxiety because I would have to leave class to go home because I felt so horrible.
euphoria,ewfjx34,t3_cnyucv,1565362509.0,I did 3 different attempts this past weekend and all were inspired by Maddy's looks. I used lash glue and gems I found at my local craft store. I have really long acrylic nails which made them kind of hard to put on but I absolutely loved the looks. They were so fun and different and I'm definitely going to go get way more gems and start using them all the time.

Lollapalooza,ew4ufo1,t3_cmgc5h,1565118547.0,"As someone who used to go when I was under 18, I really think it played a big role in expanding a lot of my views. My first lolla really opened my eyes to a ton of shit and I learned a lot of useful lessons while I was there. Don't get me wrong, I think there's some safety issues with it, but I would never want to take that experience away from someone else."

Anxiety,evm1vgi,t3_ckb303,1564602133.0,I had the same experience right when I started but I've been on it for 6 months now and feel totally normal and I am nowhere near as anxious as I used to be :)
Anxiety,evco9ux,t3_cjb0n5,1564419591.0,I do the same thing every time I have a panic attack. It sadly comes with the territory. My therapist says it's a way I try to ground myself back to reality during the attack. She recommended getting a grounding object which is basically anything small that you can carry with you and you can hold onto when you are having a panic attack and it helps you come back to reality. I've found this to be really helpful and has helped me stop scratching so much! Sorry that you have to go through this and I hope it gets better! You should also read the book when panic attacks. It's really good and has helped me a lot.
CongratsLikeImFive,evci6ir,t3_cjcmwo,1564415776.0,That's so amazing!!! I know how hard mental health and school can be and so being able to get through that and get straight As is awesome! Keep it up! You're amazing!

I've cried during every single episode and this episode was so emotional for me when Cassie's dad comes to take the china and she can see his track marks and then never hears from him again. I've never experienced something like that but just the thought of having to go through that as a young teen girl sounds absolutely horrific :,("

I believe we are all on our own journey and all have the same insecurities about being judged. Because we all feel like this, no one is actually judging because we are all too scared that other people are judging us. The first day is definitely gonna be hard and scary but it only gets easier! Good luck and I really hope you join! Joining OTF was the best decision I’ve made in a while!!"

AskReddit,eurr1n1,t3_ch0cg9,1563997793.0,"One of my favorite things that has really changed my mindset on life is noticing the small things happening around you all the time. When I  walk outside, I make sure to notice how beautiful the sky looks or how the wind feels on my skin. That has helped me so much with staying in the moment. 

&#x200B;

Therapy is the shit! My therapist has  seriously changed my life and is the reason I can leave my apartment. 

&#x200B;

The book ""When Panic Attacks"" (hahah). Basically a WAY cheaper version of therapy. 

&#x200B;

Recently I started knitting and crocheting and have found that it keeps me busy which helps with anxiety ticks and keeps my mind entertained on something rather than freaking out. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, I always keep a grounding object with me. Whether it be a gem or special object from my house, just keep something to grab and help me become grounded during/after an anxiety attack!"
