AnxietyDepression,fq8ve6p,t3_ghchh9,1589176633.0,"Please be kind to yourself!  I‚Äôve been in this situation a few times and have had similar thoughts.  Barely graduated high school, mostly because my parents (embarrassingly) begged the counselors and admin to give me a break due to mental health and other bs that had gone on that year.  I graduated in 2009, was expelled from my first college, another faceplant.  I‚Äôm 29 this year and am about to enroll in my fourth college and am still working on gen eds.  Throughout this yes my parents weren‚Äôt always the most proud and I know for a fact I basically dumped their money down the drain at times, but I can tell you my parents, and yours, would be endlessly more upset over a suicide than they would an academic failure.  It‚Äôs awful now but the days will continue on and I hope you do, too.  You‚Äôre more than what you give yourself credit for!  Give yourself a chance :)"

I‚Äôve since stopped getting acrylics put on and am working on natural growth, but I often think about this look!  These were so fun! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
