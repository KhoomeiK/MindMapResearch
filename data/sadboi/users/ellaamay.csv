AskReddit,fphp0k4,t3_g6bila,1588625170.0,"Long term anxiety sufferer here. Most of these comments describe a PANIC ATTACK and not an anxiety attack. This is how I experience panic attacks Vs anxiety attacks. 

PANIC ATTACK:
Usually lasts between 1-2 hours
Heart palpitations
Can't breath
Crying
Sweating
Choking and gagging on the air trying to breath
Tingly lips and hands
Fainting 

ANXIETY ATTACK: 
Usually lasts between 3-12 hours
Intense anxiety
Feeling 'on edge' 
Very irritable and irrational 
Can't deal with noise
Can't eat or listen to others eat
Can't drink or listen to others drink
Do not want to be touched 
Irrationally snapping at people who've done nothing wrong, I even snap at my poor dogs during anxiety attacks
Will pull at skin on my lips, bite my nails
Freak out about my hair touching my neck- it has to be in a bun"

I make my bed every day but I just fix the pillows, pick up duvet, shake in air and let fall back down neatly on the bed.. I don't see why on earth somebody would want their duvet tucked under the mattress, I'm feeling trapped just thinking about it. 

Also, I really think it is nicer to get into a made bed rather than a messy blanket/unfixed pillows. It's relaxing Vs feeling chaotic. Aaand I am a cold person and always have my electric blanket on, if my bed wasn't made it wouldn't heat up evenly. 

I actually just cannot believe regular people tuck their duvet under their mattresses in their own homes. Utterly shocked."

Is anyone else the same? I'm confused why a specialist is necessary instead of just your regular doctor, the one you'd go to for any other concerns. 

Either way, absolutely nobody should treat you this way girl! Do not let people talk to you like that! Not only is it unprofessional but it's rude and disrespectful and frankly just not acceptable.
