Anxiety,fo1e92i,t1_fo0ew1u,1587431392.0,"Probably. There is an FDA approved ketamine nasal spray called Spravato that you take several rounds of like the infusions. I think it's kind of pricey but is worth looking into, but the real hickup is administering these drugs. Spravato and the infusions can only be administered in a clinic, I'm guessing because you could have a weird reaction and they want to monitor you. For mine, I have to have someone drive me home.  Each infusion is about $325 and they could do about 6 infusions a few days apart. Then a few booster ones in a couple months. We will see and I'll learn more when I have my consultation next week."

Anxiety,fnx5urc,t1_fnwwvzi,1587332074.0,"Thanks. I hope you do too. I'm trying the ketamine because I know If I don't, I will always wonder. I'm not telling very many of my friends/family members because it's not FDA approved and I don't really want to hear their off the cuff, no-research-or-experience-dealing-with-the-terror-that-is-anxiety opinion. The only problem is I'm about to move to Wyoming which has some of the strictest laws against marijuana so I won't be able to get any or use it comfortably. I am moving for a job I guess you would consider upper management and I don't want to break the law and let my team down by getting fired. Will just be using the benzos then. Hopefully the ketamine will help too. We will see. But if you are wondering if the ketamine will work for you, you should look into it. Why not? You have NOTHING to lose. Maybe a little money, but money means nothing if you don't have your mental health. What's the point of going on an awesome vacation or buying something you really want if you can't really feel how wonderful it is. Just saying."
Anxiety,fnw9sc1,t1_fnv8ox2,1587314258.0,"Thanks for your response. I think as far as the anxiety and weed are considered I would definately put myself in the first category. Mental illness runs in my family (my brother is schizophrenic) and I think I'm just really sensitive to anxious highs because Im already so anxious that's essentially my brains 'default' if I smoke too much and start feeling a little out of control is to get anxious. Also, as far as all the info about which weed is best, I'll have to do some reading up at the sources you mentioned. I know very little. Thanks for the info. And I've tried so many different things for anxiety. I'm about to try ketemine infusions and if that doesn't work I'm starting to become more and more okay with just being a little bit stoned a good portion of the time to just get some relief. I'm over caring about what my family/ religious friends will think."
relationship_advice,fnuw1sg,t3_g3x37g,1587272626.0,Get her ass out of bed and make her clean this up with you. There are consequences to actions and she needs to pay restitution to help heal this if she wants to salvage this relationship. I honestly can't believe she didn't do this in the first place. If she really cares and was sorry she would be by your side trying to right this wrong. This is the second mistake she made. Good luck with this OP.
Anxiety,fnur5q4,t1_fnubagr,1587268952.0,"What is ""your baseline""? I find smoking just a little bit really helps with my anxiety too. Weed normally made me really paranoid/anxious so I never did it until someone informed me I had just smoked too much. Now, I feel like my heart isn't going to automatically explode and my brain isn't overloaded and on fire after like 10 seconds of talking to people after I smoke a little bit. I feel like I have more time to think and respond calmly. I absolutely agree with you-I have been in lots of therapy over almost 20 years and this is more helpful. Do you know if certain weed is better in helping anxiety than others?"
Watercolor,fni3lt0,t1_fnh0m34,1586973398.0,It was a noobie choice. I started out small and when they turned out well I was afraid I would mess them up so I stopped. But bigger would probably also be cuter on ol' Wiz boy.

I put pressure on myself that I should be comfortable with them because, after all, they are family/friends. This just makes it worse. At least with strangers, there are less expectations and I can just walk away, never too see them again or face the shame I carry being myself. I think I feel shame about myself and being with friends and family reminds me of all the panic attacks and anxiety I've had around them and it's like this big swirly panic/shame black hole. My therapist says Im one of his more hard to understand clients, so no I don't think you're super messed up but our anxiety is a bit different than the average bear."
