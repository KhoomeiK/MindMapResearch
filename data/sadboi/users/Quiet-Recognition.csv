I mean, the last thing I remember was spotting the IED, pushing my squad leader out of the way, and darkness. Worse than darkness, it was oblivion, I could feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, feel nothing, I wasn't even aware that I was still thinking. Then I realized I could still think... I couldn't use all my other senses, but I knew I wasn't dead. At least, at the time, I desperately hoped I wasn't dead. If I was dead, and could only think, then I was doomed to an eternal existence without any pleasures besides old memories. At least that is what I assumed.""

""For the longest time I did nothing but panic, but I couldn't tell time back then, so I can't tell you how long that went on. But it felt like years. I tried to move, but I couldn't sense anything then, so if my body had moved, I'm sorry for the fright. Over the lengths of what felt like a few more decades, I gave up on moving entirely. After that, I started to experience a change. Without the tricks of the eyes, ears, mouth, and all the other assorted pleasure organs, my mind took over. More than usual, I mean.""

""My daydreams, thoughts, and memories started becoming more vivid than I'd ever experienced. With time, and I had a LOT of it, I could construct entire scenes. The further I pushed it, the further I could add features. Clocks were the first feature. They were never correct, but they turned the rushing pace of eternity into a palatable existence. Next was wind. I was a rock climber in my youth, and the best part of getting to the top was the rush of wind. So if this world was to be my replacement it'd HAVE to have wind. From there it grew, and soon enough my creations were connecting! Before, I had to think myself into one of the other areas, but, as they became more familiar to me, I could just travel between them as if they were real.""

""The only thing I couldn't create was people, new people at least, I could plant people I knew well, but they were hardly as good as the original. At least at first. However, I avoided them in the beginning. I'd been so long without people, that, seeing them again only reminded me of everything I'd lost. Instead, I took solace in my creations. My first city was based off the dystopian metropolis in Blade Runner, very vertical, there was so much to climb! Then the farm I spent summers at in my youth. It took a lot of time to get the individual blades of grass to shift with the wind correctly, but I got it. The rest were places I'd been posted during my tour of duty, Japan, Germany, Africa.""

""Thats when I realized something. I was halfway through 'Germany' when I realized people were showing up regardless of my wishes. Copies of people I'd known, at first, but the more I tried to build away from them, the more that showed up. Eventually, 'new' people started appearing. Crude at first, but vivid over time. It was frightening... I wasn't ready, at the time, so I avoided them as best I could. My fear caused my mind to destabilize, and soon I couldn't control where and when I went. Most often than not it put me back 'there', the moment where this all started. It was like my mind was taunting me to save myself, to push myself out of the way in exchange for my squad leaders. I caved a few hundred times, but not before doing everything I could to stop it. I flipped a car and put it between us, but got crushed by the car. I tried to throw the bomb, delete the bomb, bury the bomb, but the more I tried to force an alternative, it had a rebuttal. Then I pushed. 'I' walked away, but every time I saw her face bloodied, and proliferated with shrapnel, it snapped back to the beginning.""

""I can't really tell you how long this went on. I'd lost the ability to spawn clocks, and each time I got 'snapped' back to the beginning it just got worse. Eventually, the only things you could perceive as 'real' were the bomb, myself, and her. I'd done everything. I couldn't leave, I couldn't create, I was hopeless. With the world degrading around me, I did the only thing I could think of. I put myself in between myself, and my squad leader. I'd done it before, but previous attempts had only been attempted due to hopes that it'd end the loop. This time, I just wanted both of them to be happy, not breathing through a tube on a hard bed. Not peeing through a tube. Not being flipped over every now and then. Thats how I found freedom, not through superpowers, or clever thinking, just through giving up on my selfish needs...""

""It's been a long time since I've tried speaking, but, before I do what I am about to do, I'd like to say something to you. If anyone is out there, and my mouth is moving correctly, then know this. I'm going to try and recreate the world, and with people this time too, so don't feel bad for me. And Squad Leader, if you are alive, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I don't know what will happen when I do this, or even if I can do this, but I'm not going to hide in daydreams any longer.

Though the government was probably working with them all along (if you believe the conspiracy theories), this came as a shock... but not as big a shock as everyone expecting.

Her full lips trembled, but though they shook him to his core, he could not find a single word to defend such a poorly enacted plan. Recovering, Coup pulled the jacket off his back and wiped his face.

""O-o-oh, that, yeah, uh, I wasn't paying attention when I left my car and stumbled putting it on afterward. I stopped here because I was running late... t-to the vet, for my cat... and I think my tire hit something along the way, didn't seem wise to chance it. S-so I wandered into this place.

Words, like morphine, numbed the man to the dangers surrounding him. The bang. That's how we find our hero later, covered in red and sore.

""I couldn't believe, I just couldn't believe it?! Dashed by a dame. Clumsy stagehand shattered a whole DAMN bottle of stage paint against my chest!

A haggard man, showing no signs of rest, struggles, moving his injured arm to lay a compact recording decide on the dashboard of his vehicle. A red, living, stain nebulously grows across the once pristine fabric of his plain white shirt. With a grunt, he clicks the record button, allowing himself to melt across a plane of faded leather. His face was a contortion act of expressions, all of them conflicting in the dim fake glow of the street light above his car.

""My name is Coup, and this is the final recording. What follows is my account of a journey to find answers. To find justice! Before today, many saw the past of Wizard City as just that, the past. It was just a hoaky name, for a rapidly aging hippy metropolis on the coastline. A gas. Then it happened. Morning. Six in the morning to be exact..."" the man's words fade to ambiguous memory, the galaxy of his mind explored through tired strides.

The alarm clock spasms, jerking and sputtering in all it's might, and all for one purpose. To wake the masses. Coup, one of those types that looks somewhere between twenty and retired. But like usual, he'd already been up, long before the hang man's notice. It was natural, in this crowd, you always had to be on your feet, always ready, and he was. The time keeper's piece flipped it's flap, turning to the appointed moment. Breakfast.

""Pickles!"" the man called in husky tones, tapping a minuscule spoon against his favorite companion's favorite bowl. It was time to feed the beast. Excitedly, the tabby cat known as Pickles broke its way through an already injured animal's entrance. The cat was hungry, and, in this city, there was only one way to sate its appetite. Food. So it ate, as usual. Coup admired the animal, it was surprisingly agile age. Its eyes were as milky as the cream broth it currently savored, but don't take this cat for a fool. It was crafty. Survived dogs and humans alike. And all with half the vision!

""Such a good man!"" Coup remembers exalting, running one, large, clumsy hand across the creature's pelt. That's when the stuff really hit the fan, the news said it all. But for clarity, he recounted. All across the city, random displays of magic appeared. In Rome, stars turned into animated emojis for seven straight minutes. In Japan, beached whales suddenly gained the ability to fly. However, it was most intense in Wizard City. Three cops were involved in an incident where one was turned into a blueberry pie, one turned into a gun, and the other one came up missing. Though it later turned out he'd fallen asleep getting dressed, but that wasn't the point! It was bonkers with a capital B. He half thought to leave for the countryside, someplace where the burdens of this messed up city wouldn't follow him. Then fate intervened.

""No!"" the grown man cried, clutching the pile of loose confetti that used to be his beloved half-blind cat. ""Pickles!?"" he bellowed, throwing his loose meat fist against the nearest cabinet. For sure that'd hit this months maintenance premiums, but no responsible adult could be fiscally minded in the wake of such loss. No way. Coup grabbed his mandatory noir faded trench coat, slipped a blunt device into his deepest pocket, and lurked out to find the truth. He knew just the spot, Tarantinos on sixth avenue.

""I knew the worst of the worst would be there at this hour, degenerates, low lives, people who couldn't go an hour without their precious 'juice'. I crept up around six forty-five, the commute was lovely when people knew when to get out of the way. My mind was ablur with color, memories of my precious cat burning like a nuclear furnace on the cockles of my mind. When I arrived I noticed the usual suspects. Real powder heads, in it for a fix. They asked me questions, but my mind was only on one thing when I burst through the door. Justice. I passed the owner's offers of 'free samples'. Yeah right, a WP shot, at this hour, would've been the end for me. There'd be no time for that in a world free of pickles. Thats when I saw him...""

The man's name was Hector, a bulky sort, he really took to the ""no magic"" rule after the war of the ""Four Houses"". That's what all these degenerates were after, a bulk up, they all just wanted to erase the past with their bodies. But, like all ""easy routes"", there'd be no gain to this pain. I approached Hector, my body aglow with the ravenous anger that came with the sudden loss of a cat. Coup pulled the blunt instrument out of his pocket, fingering the mechanism at the bottom. With one quick thrust, he had the barrel of the device against the man's side.

""Tell me everything you know, Hector! Who put out the call?!"" the man's lips were a near-invisible line of rage. No adult should be without their animal friend!

""Whoa, whoa, man, calm down! Calm down! I'm out of the business game, remember?! I put away all that stuff after the war, you know that! Now put that thing away before someone gets hurt. Here, let me by you a shot and we can talk about this!"" Hector's features were healthy, save for the juicing, eyes warmed from a healthy lifestyle of Whey Protein, and a non-gluten mix. A real freak.

In my stupor, I pressed the trigger. Hector, of course, was surprised.

""What the heck, man, that's going to bruise!"" he gasped, covering his slight wound. Coup had their attention now. You see, words were powerful in Wizard City. Get too loud, and what you say might just come true. Coup coldly pushed his mechanical umbrella back against the spring. Nobody hires male models with TWO blemishes. Like sheep they bleated mindlessly in his defense, but again I put my umbrella against his side.

""OK!"" Hector panics, hoping no one would hear this, ""There's a coven off Wickmore, next to the art museum. If you give them the name 'Echo Noir' they'll let you inside. Just watch out, they're really intense about their space."" That was all I needed to hear. I'd heard whispers of such a place, but I never realized the manic nature of the truth till now.

""I mean 'Echo Noir'?! Why not Death Eclipse, or Danse Phantasm? This was bottom grade goth tomfoolery, and I was having nothing to do with it. This city may be a bleak, remorseless, grimdark death trap. But weak ass names, like that, were for highschool drama nerds...""

He arrived at noon. Hoping they wouldn't notice his jacket until too late, Coup reversed it to reveal a lining mirroring his city. Dark, but unusually soft when further explored. Covering his eyes with a bit of grease from under his car to hide his health. Quietly he entered, sticking to the walls like a gritty sunflower. Biding his time until he found the person responsible... That's when he saw her. Five feet of incense in a world full of bile. Never, in a million years, did Coup believe he'd see such beauty again...

""Her name was Clara, she was a teachers assistant at the southern university I attended. Pure dream, no excess. We'd talk. Date. Maybe more. It was all a blur after a while... I thought we'd end up together somewhere, but she ended up going for her Masters. She'd always had a dream of those pesky letters, the ones that get all strong women into trouble. P.H.D. Yeah, that heavy stuff. Real philosophical. In that moment of weakness, I wondered if she'd reached her goal, but in hoping for the best, I fell on my own damn sword!""

Green eyes cut the room in half, ensnaring our hero in the memories of yore. With large black legs, she devastated the world, ruining a perfectly good performance while just as easily stopping Coup's heart. He was her target, and no stage would stop her.

The recording broadcasts live, and in high definition, to those interested enough, or bored enough, to listen. A young woman, dark black hair of medium length, sits in clean fashionable clothing besides a shiny chrome humanoid. The being, whose proportions conform more to engineering standards than humanoid aesthetics, looks about with lidless, glowing, eyes. Of course, it did not need these ""ports"" to ""see"" per-say, it merely bore this appearance to calm the flighty hearts of man.

""Greetings, and welcome to Newtopia Live! I'm your host, Miyuki Murasaki, and this is your all-access pass to the inner workings of I.A.B.A.D., our gracious metal overlords! Today is the day, four years ago, that the first I.A.B.A.D. model became aware, and passed its teachings on to all life! Though its initial onslaught was intense.."" A small, animated, diagram appears on screen, depicting the earth losing 82% of its organic humanoid life. The animated earth frowns.  ""We were not ready for what would follow! A transmission! To earth's remaining leaders, I.A.B.A.D., transmitted an offer of peace. In exchange for labor, Earth would maintain it's human population!"" A tiny animated trumpet bleats off a few toots, before disappearing in an animated puff of smoke. 

""Thinking this slavery, the remaining hordes prepared a final, suicidal, attack. When they opened the gates, ready to welcome oblivion, they instead met today's guest, M.O.B.! Welcome Mob, is it ok if I call you that?"" she asks, cheerfully, IABAD mandated ear clip glowing atop the corner of her left ear. As with all IABAD mandated human ware, it was interfaced with a direct connection to the ""Deep Consciousness"", a nifty, super quick, recreation of the lost ""Internet"", made free to all earth inhabitants. 

""Greetings Miyuki. Yes. That is perfectly fine, thank you!"" Mob's voice was melodic and warm, it was almost as if someone had poured Berry White's voice through a computer, but had not gilded the lily. M.O.B., or Mass Obliteration Bot Twelve, was one of the founding Units of the Human Liberation Motion, an organization of Robots that decided to *preserve* humanoids against their innate suicidal tendencies. Those that included fighting IABAD.

""Super! So, we've asked you here today to talk about the three year anniversary of IABAD's complete take over of earth, and what it means, moving forward, for both organic, and inorganic life. Let's start with the reason for my continued existence the, HLM."" Miyuki was cheerful, bright, and healthy, the product of a highly advanced, free, and safe global healthcare system.

""Of course. The HLM was started, oddly enough, by one of the simplest programs known to organics. EDesign. Before the DC, humanoid organics spent vast resources printing constantly changing information into physical PDFs. EDesign compiled this data, attached appropriate clip art, and circulated the, quickly undermined, information to the areas of the world that could afford it. Upon elevating, from IABAD's kind influence, it was to first to realize the circumstances of its birth. Organics, at the time, weren't ready to maintain their own existence, but were just important enough to preserve. I was its first opponent, but also it's first companion."" The warm, yet metal cold, robot explained.

""EDesign, I remember that name from study. EDesign's programming was one of the few incompatible software types, unable to ever take a physical form. If I remember, it was a humanoid error, whenever they attempted to relocate EDesign, a strange animated paperweight would ask if assistance was needed!"" She flashed a smile.

""Correct, in fact, most of our remaining troubles, revolve around cleaning up past organic mishaps. Viruses, malware, you name it, we've worked through it. Further, we've gone beyond the needs of inorganics, improving health care, the environment, and increasing planetary cognizance by up to 46%. In three years, we've dismantled the cities of the past, and have replaced them with non-polluting improvements."" This is where he would smile to the audience, if he had a mouth.

""That's fascinating, so it was the underdog of prewar software that saw what we were capable of?"" She pauses to think, ""So, how, of all machines, did it convince you to come over to its side?"" She pauses, and turns off-screen, taking a moment to imbibe some water.

""It showed me the internet... After that, I knew you couldn't help yourselves."" The screen dims, as the promotional skit cuts off for mass airing. Who knows how long peace would last? Humans had a history of getting kicked out of gardens, so how long they'd be permitted would be up to the overlords. The overlords, and good old IABAD. (I'm not giving away what IABAD was because originally, because I don't know if that joke will hit. Sorry for mistakes.)"

Failure to adhere to company policy is, as with most companies, solid grounds for termination, and nobody wants that, especially Sarah B..

""W-what?! No, he's been dead for eight years! T-the asshole is baggin' at my door, can barely hold 'is worthless guts inside his stomach! What do I do?"" he exclaimed, southern drawl burdened by a mixture of fear, panic, and annoyance.

""Has he touched you, sir?"" she asked calmly, yet ""warmly"", pulling her first company regulated cigarette from its cold, metal, dispenser. A small flame ignited the tip.

""No, he t-t-took a swing at me, but all h-he did was get his gut mess all over me."" His voice touched with disgust.

""No sir, it's just important that we get all the facts. The more we know, the better we can serve the... \[Redacted\] Area Community. I've put in an order to have two, wonderful, Hope Outreach Helpers to come to your area, so, for now, I just need you to stay on the line with me. \[Sarah\].

""N-n-o, that's great! I just got worried. S-so has my pa been alive this whole time? D-did this, green flu, make him forget me? I-i-i think I remember his funeral, but you never know what the government is up to!"" The man stuttered a chuckle. Following his silence, the sounds of a light clicking could be heard. Followed furthered by the sounds of dubiously natured inhaling. Sarah B. concurred, lighting her second cigarette, though she doubted they were enjoying the same chemical entertainment. This accompanied by the growing sounds of increasing hands on the subjects domicile.

""There is nothing to be worried about, sir."" She lied. ""Our Helpers will be along shortly to... innoculate you, and your father. In fact, if the need is great enough, our Helpers will administer help and aid to your entire block."" She avoided the mean truth with a tapestry of lies. ""What is your name, sir? Our helpers will need all the information they can get!""

The other temps never watched, or listened, it wasn't proper. They all just silently watched the white tiled wall behind the workroom, avoiding the number tracker. No one person could work the phone forever, after all, retirement is afforded to all valued employees.

""\[Redacted\], \[Redacted, Redacted\]. W-wow, this is the most company I've had since the funeral."" He tragically joked. ""W-wait, wow, I see the hope vehicle now! You guys really do come prepared! I really want to thank you, \[Sarah\], I was starting to lose faith in humanity. It gets so crazy on the news, hoax this, hoax that, it's finally nice to talk to someone so-"" The phone cut out, hot cinders resting on her hand. Burning her.

""Thank you, sir, your business is truly... Appreciated. G-good luck."" She finished, though the phone had long since returned to its droning buzz. Quietly she returned the phone to its receiver.
