SuicideWatch,fae0gek,t3_e8gjky,1575990941.0,"first of all I'm deeply sorry you had to go through this
what happened was never your fault, you shouldn't feel ashamed or afraid to say what happened to you
you're not disgusting and you should never feel that way about yourself. 
i know it's extremely hard to overcome something so traumatic like this but ending your life is never the answer 
your gf may be experiencing post trauma but she should never act like this way, she's still too young and naive to realise how harmful it is to say something like that
stay strong"
unpopularopinion,f8oasd5,t3_e113jc,1574670688.0,"i agree with you, but some men can be scared of being called ""a pussy"" or being told to ""grow a pair"" if they actually try to express themselves or show emotions, and these things being said mostly from other men
that's why we have this false image that men lack emotions or can't feel anything
which is absolutely wrong and needs to change. 
people need to understand that fear and love and other emotions are connected with the human nature and that includes both men and women and one shouldn't be ashamed or bullied for showing any."
