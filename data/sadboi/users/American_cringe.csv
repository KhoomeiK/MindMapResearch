She/ he’s using a fuzz pedal during that part of the song! I should try to get one of those!”"

But I can close my eyes and tell you every emotion or feeling people are feeling in the room. I’m very introverted, so Sometimes this is a curse for me because I am a very timid person around people with very dominate and aggressive energy and it causes me to have panic attacks if I’m stimulated by them talking to me or interacting with me for too long or or even over time. Some dominate personalities arnt bad though, it’s usually the ones accompanied by aggression that sends off violent or negative energies that keep me on the edge."
