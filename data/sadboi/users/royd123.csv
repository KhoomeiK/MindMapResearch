It’s skin cells and he searched her bag so it’s very likely it transferred to his hands and then to his crotch sometime that day. 
Let’s not forget the fact that she told her mom that she was gonna date this hot cop after being raped. 

How about the fact that many of the victims claimed he was black and short or blonde and short 

How about the fact that 8 out of 21 victims cases were thrown out because they flat out lied. 

How about the fact he consented to have all his personal belongings searched. But the cops didn’t search any of it. They took his 1 uniform he was wearing but they didn’t even take his underwear for forensics the morning after he supposedly raped someone. 

How about the fact that the cops looked up a list of poor, drug addicted black women and started contacting them trying to get more victims. There’s even a interrogation video of one of these women where she says that Daniel didn’t rape her but the cops keep pushing and feed her lines to get her to fit the narrative. 

How about the one victim who said she was raped for 10 mins in a school yard on his cop car. But then the gps shows he drove by the school and never stoped and his speed never went below 2 mph. 

I don’t know why he would be framed for this but this did happen pretty close the police shooting of micheal brown I think. So sounds like they were trying to avoid any negative press and wanted to shut this case down as fast as possible."
