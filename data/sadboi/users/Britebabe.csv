This is a total mindf*ck that I even came across your post.... Don't end up like me. Don't waste time tearing yourself apart trying to figure out where you went wrong and why and wallowing in dispair over how you could have done things differently. Thats how you end up missing your 27th birthday, 2015 (yes, the whole f*cking year) and all the holiday events where there was drama with someone who wasn't you!! 🤦

Get a therapist, visit a church, go on a retreat - whatever you have to do to get out of your own head about your life. Thats our pitfall. Perfectionists are constantly dissecting everything for errors and inefficiencies. Trust me on this. We could trade stories or if you want to look at some of my old posts, thats fine too if you feel you need a point of reference, but the bottom line is that at the point where you've hit rock bottom, you need someone elses help to be able to truly accept the truth:

1. X got f*cked up. It happened. Any questions as to why or how are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.

2. Time is moving on with or without you.

3. You have the ability to start anew because guess what? X happened and you're still here despite it happening. 

I'm cringing a little after typing that because its not anything I ever wanted to think was real. I'd imagined a personal utopia where I planned certain things and carried them out methodically ultimately resulting in the ideal life I had designed for myself. 🛑✋ Thats not real life. You'll never be able to tell yourself that. If you could then you wouldn't be depressed!!

Life is chaos. Do you know why we are perfectionists?? Its a type of response to the chaos we have personally experienced in life. Its a flawed coping mechanism. Thats why we need outside help. Its the only way to achieve some type of balance in our thinking. Its the only way we can learn to bury our pasts, our mistakes, our failures, etc and actually get to living.

You want to be a writer?? Then write. If you lose your hands tomorrow you'll be wishing you'd written today. I learned to sew. I suck at it but I always wanted to learn. Maybe one day I won't suck at it, perhaps I'll be the worst forever but you know what? I've seen worse shit than mine selling on etsy for actual money and those mofos are more than happy to sell and buy each others crap, no questions asked. Why shouldn't I get mine too?? This is our time. Time to f*ck it up six ways to sunday!! 🔥🤘🤑🎸 

Caution to the wind. It feels like when you're home alone and you don't have to wear pants only for your soul: it feels amazing when you just do it and don't think about it. 🌬👖Where are my pants now?? They're with all the f*cks I no longer give.

venting,fpougfh,t3_geludc,1588790858.0,"My mom used to work for the NYPD and some of the stuff was really brutal and horrible that she had to deal with. They had a therapist on staff for the officers and personnel to talk to when they faced situations similar to yours.  One of the methods that helped her out the most was to compartmentalize those types of events as work related. When you put your stuff away in your work locker or you go to clock out or whatever, take a moment, take a breath and as you exhale mentally put away the events of that day. You can't take that home with you. You are strong enough to handle it because you already handled it and didnt break down. Now you just need tact to keep going. I'm also speaking to you as a person who has had to teach myself a lot of discipline to get through some heavy things. Right now, in this moment, you need to disassociate any events that happen at work with your home life. This is how you make it through. When its all over then you will be able to have the time and space to grieve. For now, pack it away. Enter your house as a though it were a palace and you are the ruler there. You control what you feel there and when you leave again for work the next day that is when you pick up that mantle and become the warrior you need to be at work. Know that you are making a difference right now. There will be loses, but because of you and your colleagues there will be many more who are saved. You have my deepest respect and admiration. 🕊"

I'm of mixed ethnicity so I use a bunch of different things for my curls and change products for summer and winter. Try ogx to start, they make amazing shampoo and conditioner that are really hydrating which is important for soft beautiful curls. A leave in conditioner is also great, it helps so that you dont have to use a lot of other products which will just weigh your hair down, clog the pores and follicles and make you have to wash your hair more often (less washing is best for curls). I've used garnier leave ins on and off for years. Look for things like marula oils, coconut oil, avocado oil or olive oil too. You could even do a hot oil treatment with some of these to get started. You'll see an immediate difference in softness and manageability and it promotes hair growth too. Also sleeping with a satin bonnet is life!!!!

You've stumbled onto a truth my friend and life truths often stirr us up to the point of desperation. You thirst for change and thats an amazing thing. Thats the part of you that yearns to live. I don't mean existing, I mean actually living and doing and experiencing. You are on the threshold of something amazing. Its scary as hell, but each step in the direction of the change you feel like making is bringing you closer to finding your true self and the fulfilment you couldn't find in your old life. I had the same revelation as you a long time ago. I wasn't suicidal but something felt so wrong with my whole life, all of it felt wrong, like a nightmare almost and it ate at me constantly. It was like a leaky faucet just dripping and all you hear is that stipid nagging sound over and over again until you go mad. At one point I convinced myself that my life wasn't real. I freaking Inceptioned myself...

Somewhere along the lines of all this I realized that I didn't want to actually die. I just didn't want my old life anymore. Thats where you're at now and its not a bad thing. Sometimes we spend so much of our lives and ourselves investing emotionally and physically, with out time and efforts, in other people that we lose any semblance of self.  

About 10 years ago I told my brother what I'm telling you right now. He was in the same headspace you're in right now and even more eerie is that he also gave himself a deadline. I told him to just go. At the point where you're ready to end it all - to do something will the level of absolution that comes with death - what have you got to lose?? F*ck it. Go for the gold. Go live your best life the way you want to live it. You want to see the world?? Go do it. Climb a mountain, jump from a plane, pet a lion. Whatever. Go live. In that moment when I told him that, his eyes lit up with the wonder of a child. The possibilities were a breath of fresh air. 

Of course I had to explain things to my mom because he was young but he left across the country to start a new life. We didn't see him for 2 years. We spoke and he skyped my mom which helped her a lot. But he needed this and I loved him too much to watch him waste away. Its like I told my mother, I'd rather have him alive and happy somehwere else even if it means not seeing him for a long time, than to know there will never be a chance to see him again because he's dead and whats more he would have died miserable.

My brother eventually came back to visit. He had taken odd jobs to give him the flexibility to come and go as he please. He decided to go to school for engineering because he had a knack for it. He travels a lot and loves it. Most of all, when he came back he was a new man, an amazing, mature, wise, happy man. The change was amazing and truly a blessing for all of us.

You need to be made whole and because in your heart you know its never going to happen if things keep going the way they are now. It isn't selfish to want better things for yourself. On the contrary, its a lesson you want to teach your kids. When you love something sometimes you do have to set it free. If your family loves you they will understand, even if its not right away.

Make a plan to live rather than a plan to die. I'll leave you with this. Sure its from the Bible, but I find that most old books have wisdom even if they're religious. ""[The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who has found a pearl of great price and knowing its worth he sells everything he has to get it]."" Seems foolish but its not. You have to see the value in you, in your life. If this parable doesn't work for you then heres some Confucius: ""We have 2 lives. The second one begins when you realize you only have one."""
depression,ffiyc4v,t3_etuq5c,1579985727.0,"You're an exceptionally strong person, don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Quitting drugs takes so much perseverance. I've seen people struggle through it and most don't make it, but the ones who do are so much better for it in the long run. My best advice for you would be to find a support group. Try to find an LGBT group or group therapist. Going through depression myself I discovered in therapy that a lot of what has kept me depressed are hang ups and traumatic stuff from my childhood and teen years. It was things I thought I had gotten over or I didn't realize affected me as strongly as they had. I buried a lot of stuff too. Humanly we are engineered to cope with things in order to survive. Unfortunately most of us have shitty coping skills so it comes back to bite us in the ass years or even decades later.

I spent the greater part of my life pushing for achievements because I wanted to feel special. I thought that applauds from a crowd would fill the void left by my parents when they would cast me aside. All I did was work myself sick. What made it worse is that I wouldn't let anyone in because I was afraid to be judged, afraid no one would understand. I finally let one person in because I was layed out on my floor for 4 days waiting to die. I guess I just wanted someone to know I was leaving this earth. But she found me and that was when I started to see the value of having a support system. Part of the problem was that I was taught it was shameful to ask for help.

I honestly count it as a miracle that someone cared enough to physically come get me, break into my apartment, and take me to a hospital. God knows I don't think I deserve that kind of love - but I do.

WE ARE ALL WORTHY OF LOVE.

💖 You are worthy of love. 💖

Sometimes it takes the support of another person to help us see it. Maybe you didn't get the best family, but you can make a new one. Thats the beauty of change. Surround yourself with people who value you and care for you, people who can empathize because they've gone through their own struggles too. If you can't find a group you like right away then try a church group or hobbyists or book club. There are lots of options an opportunities to make new bonds that will enrich your life. Don't discount yourself either, because your story might be just what someone else needs to hear to save their life.

Be blessed my friend. 🦄"

depression,ff9u0ye,t3_erwrla,1579721282.0,"Religion has always existed and it endures because people need to believe in something, they want to believe in something existential in order to achieve some type of escape from their daily lives - from suffering, mundane existence, fear. Religion fits in with all of our instinctive coping mechanisms. That function is not Christianity specific. There were religions before Christianity and there will be ones after. There are people who believe in aliens, outside entities with powers, worlds beyond our own, etc. There are people who follow leaders or ideologies because it gives them hope or whatever they need to fill the void. And if you think about it, political parties much different than religion. They preach a set of beliefs, garner lots of followers, take money from those followers....

Theres no use in putting anyone down for their beliefs. The arc of history is pretty clear about religion. I for one would rather spend my time as the great philosophers did: searching for truth through understanding. In the case of depression that means understanding myself. I'm sure we can all agree on how hard a road this is. You do what you have to do to make it and for most of us that also means taking help wherever you can get it."

My dad and godfather were involved in the civil rights movement in the 60s and they taught me principals that are just so drastically different from what I see being fed to younger people today.

Its nice to see I'm communicating with someone educated. Unfortunately you edited away the post containing the majority of what I was responding to.

1. Moors were black according to every painting I've ever seen of one. Honestly, I welcome if you could shed some light on why they would be depicted as black in artwork but not be black.
2. Puerto Rico isn't a nation. It never has been. It's a U.S. territory. All Puerto Ricans are American in nationality.
3. Never said my mom was brown. But you insinuated that indigenous blood was required to claim Puerto Rican decent, which is a popular misconception and one that I don't like.
4. I engaged because I feel kind of a way about the assumption that if you're European you are somehow part of a majority. Like there are no minorities in Europe or who can claim European descent and still be minorities. I say ""brown"" because there really isn't a place for people who are in between white and black. But one shouldn't be discounted just because they don't fit into one of those 2 brackets. I just get upset I guess when I see people speak about nationality, race, ethnicity interchangeably..."
unpopularopinion,ff4f013,t1_ff3tczd,1579562033.0,"If you aren't sure what you're debating why comment??? Its ethnicity vs race, culture vs skin color.

FYI, I'm Puerto Rican. I'm 2% black and 25% Arawak and I'm very schooled on my ancestry and history and pretty well on genetics, especially whare it concerns my bastardized race. Not fitting in anywhere kind of made it important for me to study these things and unlike some people I don't like to open my mouth without knowing what I'm talking about.

**Deep breath...**

Not all Puerto Ricans or any Hispanic/Latino have native ancestry. My moms dna is 100% European even though her family is all from PR for 200 hundred years. Also if you know about genetics then you know that the more tan you are as well as your ability to tan, the more melanin you have. It means you have black ancestry somewhere down the line even if its through Middle Eastern ancestors because their ancestors before them came from Africa and Asia. As you may or may not know, Spain was under Moorish rule for a long time. Moors were North African Muslims. They were black. So the fact that Antonio Banderas is swarthy is significant here. Thats genetics. Thats dna representation. I can't tan because of the ginger ancestors on my moms side, more genetics, specifically a defect in the MC1R gene - and please - if you need me to go into details I will gladly oblige. Or wait... maybe none of this matters because since I wasn't actually born in Puerto Rico I shouldn't be able to identify as one of them!!! 🤣 If Joaquin Phoenix who was born there can't do it why should I?? And I guess Lupita Nyong'o can't say she's Mexican either. 


TLDR:
Race politics is nonsense because the world is mixed. History will tell you that. It has no place when it comes to giving people awards based on their talents. The whole point of my post was to gauge if it really is a skin color thing or if cultural diversity factor into the criticisms I'm seeing???"

So is it not ok for him - an actor who has always been an actor by profession - to be awarded for a spectacular performance vs JLo to win an award when acting isn't even her preffered artform??? Maybe the conversation would be different if JLo stopped spray tanning or if Joaquin would get some sun...

depression,fezq9n0,t1_fewwn88,1579460293.0,"That's not true. You can't define depression by that one thing any more than you can define what a peak is. Sweeping generalizations like that don't hold water. They're logical fallacies.

Peaks are different for everyone. Somebody say theirs is having a kid or traveling the world and someone else's peak might be solving a rubiks cube (me)... Overwhelmingly, when you're depressed you're seeing things through your own extremely focused lens and there is a tendency to project that across the whole spectrum of life, but that's not reality. People are more complex than that. Sometimes a very simple thing can mean the world to a person.

I once had big goals and dreams for myself that were left unrealized but it dawned upon me that if I keep chasing after something I know I will never attain its just going to trap me at the bottom forever; the mere thought will continue to torment me until I die - something has to die: me or the dream. And why should I die??? Who's in control here??? I gave myself those aspirations so I have the power to change them. 

This realization has helped me start to move on, slowly, but after 10 years of living what you adequately call bullshit I finally feel something changing. Sometimes you have to bury the old and give yourself something new. I mean this literally too. I literally gave my old life a eulogy about a month ago. I had spiraled really bad. I felt something die in me. I felt like I would die, I should just die, but I don't want to die. This was my literal thought progression.  So I decided to mourn my past, things I lost, things I never would be able to have, parts of me that I knew were gone. I packed a box of stuff and gave it away, gave some things to family for their own memories and I'm going to burn the rest when I'm ready for the final goodbye. And this made me wonder, what if I could be reborn, what kind of person would I choose to be? If I had no past who could I be?  The answer is infinitely greater than the nothing I was desperately holding on to all those years.

Do I know what I want or who I want to be yet? Nope. A few things come to mind here and there and I write them down but the newness makes me feel something I've never felt before.  All I know for certain is that its better than what I had. In this life I think thats the most we can truly hope for: better. Not good, not bad, maybe different, but moving always toward something that can be better than what it was before.

  
I'll leave you with this:

TLDR: Just because you don't want to live, doesn't mean that you want to die - it just means you don't want your present life anymore. Its your mind, maybe even your soul, telling you that you need change. Yes, it's the end, but it could also be a beginning if you want it to be. Don't lose your power in this darkness my friend.

See a guidance counselor if you can. If they feel your father is causing you emotional harm or hindering your health in another way they may be able to intervene. Schools have state laws that they have to abide by no matter what anyone says. Additionally you may be able to petition the court to not have to see your dad. I'm in NY and here if you are over 10 or 12 (can't remember precisely) you can tell the court you don't want to visit a parent anymore if you feel its hurting you or unsafe.

I went to confession once just to vent and I'm not even catholic but the priest was really nice and talked me off the ledge. Keep looking for a way through this and eventurally you will find it."
depression,fel1igs,t3_eppt67,1579212033.0,"First off, this is how you know who your real friends (and family) are. I lost everything a few years ago after developing panic disorder and some other health problems that were brewing and since I neglected my health they got really bad... You're blessed to have gotten disability for mental health. Its pretty rare. I've been living on $180 a month, in limbo with disability for 4 years because they say I can work but my doctors say I can't... Living at my mom's secretly because I'm not on the lease. ✌

Also back to your shit fair weather friends, when I was about to get evicted way back when this started, my friend and her boyfriend who I didn't even know that well lent me 6k to pay off my back rent without batting an eyelash. They told me to pay it back when I could. No bitter feelings, no side eye, no shade. Thats friendship because sure, i dont have money, but when my friend is sick in the hospital I'm there with her, im there if she needs me to pick up her daughter from school, I'm there on the phone when she needs to vent.

Money comes and goes. I had money once, corporate money, and I shared because it came out of my heart to do so. What is it worth to have all the money in the world and see the people you care about be miserable??? It wasn't me and I think somehow God saw that or the universe or whatever, and the karma came back to me because I found a true ride or die friend and we share the belief that love is what really matters in life. Shes the only one who's been by my side all this time. 

Long story short, dont feel bad about losing people who aren't all the way there for you. Reciprocity and love are the foundation of any lasting relationship.

Also, hate saying this, but you've got to be more prudent with your money even if it means having to downgrade your living situation. Harsh truth and believe me when I say this isn't coming as a criticism. Obviously I don't know you like that to be able to judge, nor am I in any position to. I'm  merely speaking from experience. Budgeting is super important. It hurts now but helps a lot in the long run. Do some research, you can get a lot of great tips online.

Best of luck."
depression,fekyxu7,t3_epmseq,1579210503.0,"Come to NYC. By law we are obligated to shelter anyone in the city, the shelters aren't all together terrible, but it'll help you get into public housing faster. If you're on disability they give you priority too, I think like 1 year max waiting time last I checked. Theres also a lot or room-share here too which is what all the illegals do because its the cheapest way to live. You also get free medical, food stamps. So many benefits... I grew up in a poor neighborhood and my family helped a few homeless people get off their feet which is why I know this stuff. Ironically, I also almost ended up homeless myself after a health crisis. I lost almost everything but having access to some of the resources this city provides has been helping me slowly get my life back together. 

You've still got some fight left in you, I can see that. I know what its like to feel like you're done and spent. Cry today, give yourself the day to feel like sh*t, then regroup. Sell whatever you can replace on Craigslist, get enough for a bus or plane ticket. You've got to give yourself the chance that others haven't given you. You deserve it just as much as anyone else. They aren't better than you."

I think the sentimental component potentilly implied in this theory fits right in line with the wierd ways Rick displays affection. It could be a great way to add more depth to his character and his relationship with Morty or maybe use it to segway into what happened to Dianne...

depression,fc86awh,t3_egnm6h,1577527826.0,"Jesus..17? I've lost 3 but not all at once...I know that very few people will be able to relate, but here's all I got:

This is probably going to seem like the worst advice ever but it'll get you at least through the beginning of this, if it's fresh.

Lock the pain away. My mom used to work in the police department with abused children cases and one of the techniques they taught her to help deal with the horrible things she saw on the job was disassociation. She would always put her files away and clear her desk before leaving, and thus symbolically leaving her feeling about what she saw at work. She didn't take it home with her. Sometimes that's what we need to do to start moving on. 

You have survivors guilt. Everything you feel is normal. But right now your emotions and mind are in a frenzy. There isn't any logical thing you can do except distract yourself from thinking about what's happened. That will at least buy you a some time to re-center and figure out how you are going to get through this. Literally write down a plan for the next day or week or whatever, with steps and to just do things robotically.

That's how I've been able to overcome the absolute worst things I've had to deal with - planning my baby nephews funeral. This is the first time I've mentioned it in over 10 years. I didn't grieve for close to 6 months after it happened. Then I cried for 3 days. Its important when these things hit you to find a place where you can cry alone and just grieve. Miss them, remember the joy they brought you and you brought them, know that they aren't suffering anymore, that they may have been spared an even worse fate...

It might ultimately help to write letters to your friends when you are ready to say goodbye. It's weird but a lot of the cliche stuff is true - they would want you to live and live happily. You would honor them by doing that. It would be the best gift you could give them because they loved you.

Speaking from experience...I let my parents guilt me into going to a college they chose and I won't go into detail because its too much, but it snowballed into ruin. Ruined my relationship with them and I lost years of my life with that stupid college.

If you can't come to an understanding with your parents and if tech is what you really want to do then you're going to have to make it happen for yourself.

You are doing the right thing by asking for help. If your school has a guidance counselor go to them. Hell, I would even talk to the school nurse if I had to. Sometimes there is even a church or something with youth counselors, not preaching religion here, but its a place to talk with people who may actually listen and have something positive to say to you. There are also help hotlines, many free ones where you can call and talk to counselors.

If you really want your parents attention, send them a few of these tragic reddit stories so they can see you aren't alone - this is a crisis amoung teens all over the world. If they love you, they'll listen. If not then you need outside help until you can get out on your own.

I don't know where you are but in the US if you need help and you go to a hospital and you are a minor they can not turn you away. They have to help you. Worst case scenario I would start calling doctors.

You matter. You are important to this world or else you wouldn't be here. You have a purpose even if you don't know what it is yet. If someone doesn't value you then you need to find and be with people who do.

Side note: Art is reflective of the artist; so saying that art can't be good or evil is like saying a person can't be good or evil. Clearly based on what you've witnessed thats simply not the case. Art is used to provoke thought and feeling so it can be used for good or evil. History proves that. Propaganda art for example is used exclusively to manipulate people going back to before the Renaissance."

It's wrong and people suffer when nobody is willing to put their foot down against it. 

I'm so sorry that you've been made to feel alone and like something is wrong with you by people who are supposed to love you. I have stuggled with gender non-confimities myself and it really made me learn what God is and what God isn't. People judge your body, God looks into your heart. 💖

If you're on a path it isn't anybody elses business to judge you. Proverbs 3:6 says God makes our ways straight - meaning that if you ever need it, you will receive divine intervention like in a cosmic universal way - not from a person forcing you to do something.

I hate to deal out this sad truth but nothing is going to change in your family situation until your mom gets the medical help she most likely needs. I'm real familiar with the symptoms. A close relative of mine was like that but with drug use and my family finally convinced her to see a doctor after a suicide attempt. They diagnosed her as bipolar with OCD and PTSD from childhood trauma. She's been on medication and seeing a psychiatrist for a few years and shes so different now. She's been off drugs and barely drinks for 5 years now. Only wish it would have happened earlier in her life so we could enjoy things the way we do now.

Your mom needs medical intervention. If you have to call the cops and they have to take her to a psych ward for a few days then that's what you have to do. It might be the only way to save her. 

Don't try doing it alone if you can help it. If there are people who care for her they will help you get her the proper medical attention and with things at home. You will burn out doing it alone.

TL;DR: Your mom needs more help than you can give her. If she doesn't get professional help your situation will just keep going downhill. Speaking from experience."

Then when I was 24 my younger sister got sick and lost her memory.

My life fell apart 5 years into her being sick because I was pushing myself so hard for a career I didn't want.

depression,fbs679c,t3_ee58l8,1577050809.0,"I'm probably older than everybody here, in my 30s...i had 3 small breakdowns in high school then a big one in college. Was top of my class always, advanced mathematics and chemistry. It sounds like you may be on the threshold of a burn out.

What helped me in high school and during very stressful times in my life was making sure I got some quality down time. Naps for example in addition to regular sleep are super helpful. Weirdly I used to color to get the creative side of my brain working (and the other side resting) and it helps tremendously. I mean like with crayons and a kids coloring book literally.

If you're studying or cramming writing things  down actually helps you remember them better. It helps a engage kind of muscle memory if you will as well as pictorial memory. So write outlines, put things in charts, etc. on actual paper. Sticky notes for daily activities also a winner. Its the writing though - the physical act of writing where the magic happens.

*Not medical advice* but meds can be treacherous especially antidepressants so I suggest you do some research on whatever the doctor prescribed you. I was on zoloft for a few years and my mind was in a constant fog. I couldnt even hold a conversation, i would space out all the time. I've been off it now for a few months and I can express myself more clearly and think a little more clearly too. Remember, antidepressants are dampeners, so if you're needing to use your brain a lot the side effects may outweigh the benefits when it comes to high doses of it because it's causing parts of your brain to slow down in order to control the depression or anxiety. The best thing imo is to find a natural, maybe herbal solution because those meds can have long term negative side effects.

Make sure you don't have a vitamin deficiency either. That could also hinder your ability to focus, etc. Maybe consider seeing an endocrinologist and nutritionist. Healthy body, healthy mind.


*TL;DR* : You're on the brink of a burn out and you need to rest the part of your brain thats being overworked. Secondly you need to tap in to the creative part of your brain and muscle memory to help make up for the lag on your logical side. Thirdly make sure you don't also have a vitamin deficiency."

Unfortunately there's a huge stigma surrounding depression. People just think it means you have a weak character. But its so much more complex than that and left unchecked it can be fatal, as many of us here can attest to.

If your family/friends care they'll read up on depression and see what they can do to support you through this. Good luck. 🙏"

Changing to an anti-inflammatory diet helped me through most of the side effects within 1 month...except the bitchiness of course! Also treat yourself to a facial, if only to make yourself feel nice. Stress plays a big role in our hormone balance so doing a few nice things for yourself to relax really does help in the long run. Good luck!"

I had a depressing week remembering my last Christmas with my sister before she lost her memory, now officially 10 years ago.  It's bitter sweet because the holiday stuff also brings me back to those good times when we were kids."
depression,fbf7pr9,t3_eczhm3,1576803746.0,"OMG!! 🙀 Visit your friend!!! Your family will fell however they feel but they'll get over it. I've been in your shoes. Last year I was in the hospital with my bff and my family understood even though they were sad. Hard times are the true test of friendship. If your heart says go, and your friend needs you, do it or you'll regret it! Everything else will sort itself out. 💖"
