- “I was pretty rebellious at your age too. I got drunk a few times and didn’t go to church for a year. That was my rock bottom and really helped me build my testimony.”

- “I had a child out of wedlock when I was in my 20’s and realized I needed to get married and come back to church for myself and my baby.”

- “I used to not believe in the church either but after my life started falling apart, I realized Heavenly Father was real and my life would not get better until I started going back to church.”

I’ve heard hundreds of these stories from older TBM’s and I’ve often wondered if these were the first generational steps toward breaking free en masse, but they simply didn’t have all of the necessary ingredients. They speak as if they were fully out to establish some kind of empathy but in actuality they were simply just angsty, young, and likely curious jack-Mormons who never broke through the indoctrination. (You never truly know just how deeply mind-fucked you are until you’ve broken out completely and have been out for years.) In many cases they regard “falling away” and coming back as perfectly normal and a staple facet of growing up, though they fail to see that that very conflict was the pinnacle in solidifying the cage of their indoctrination and subjugation.

Millennials and Gen Z have had far more internet exposure and access to de-programming information during their critical years of personality development (late teens to early 20’s). The game has changed entirely and I think Mormons across the spectrum are beginning to realize this is increasingly becoming less of a number of phases and more of a mass movement. Correct me if I’m wrong, but within the last couple of years or so, I’ve seen greater civility and love between TBM parents and their apostate children. Despite the tone deaf remarks of general authorities, few TBM’s truly want to divide their families along ideological lines when faced with the understanding that these choices to leave are indeed permanent and far less milquetoast compared to their own “transgressions” back in the day. We’re breaking the chains they neither had the resources nor the environment to identify and destroy during their formative years."

While the majority of its leadership is gradually succumbing to a corporate, neoconservative interpretation of the gospel as the wealthy retirees from the Reagan Era continue to muscle their way up the holy corporate ladder, much of the traditionalists—especially in rural communities—are doubling down. It’s a battle between a business model and this continued cult obsession with replacing the medieval Catholic Church as the ultimate theocracy. This all of course places the highest and oldest GA’s on the spot since they’ve all likely come to prominence through both of these models. Regardless, corporatism and traditionalism in the church, while existing in proximity to one another for generations, have been on a crash course for some time and eventually traditionalism will have to give (you see the same trend developing across culture throughout the US). Meanwhile you also have a growing number of progressive/liberal Mormons doing everything in their power to make the church seem more appealing and less exclusive (good fucking luck). I could see a number of schisms within the coming decades. The corporatists will maintain the mainstream, many of the traditionalists will likely fracture into splinter sects (Krakauer’s *Under the Banner of Heaven* shows this has already been happening to some degree for decades), and the progressive Mormons will either fall in line with the corporatists or go inactive/apostate."

It gives the TBM family members and friends of the deceased some solace in knowing their loved one may not be condemned for his/her actions, primarily due to mental illness. It’s loose doctrine rooted vaguely on some remarks made by that Frankenstein’s monster, McConkie, when he was alive that I don’t really care to dig up right now. That being said, you’re absolutely right, it’s a blanket statement designed to pardon the church, its culture, its beliefs, and anything connected to these from blame and responsibility—though in many regards, the church’s overly obtuse and insensitive *one-size-fits-all* environment can easily apply the right amount of pressure to push someone over the edge.

I saw it with my mother who, regardless of some struggles with depression, still managed to run a business and care for her family. Sadly, despite her success, there was a guilt planted in her by the church‘s culture that grew with the years:

*Why wasn’t she in the home?*

*Why did she divorce her first husband?* (He was extremely abusive.)

*Why didn’t she try harder to make things work between them?*

*Why wasn’t she trying harder to be more like the plastic trophy wives in her neighborhood?*

*Why wasn’t she allowing her husband to be the soul provider?*

*Why wasn’t she trying [this medication]?*

*Why didn’t she have more faith? She wouldn’t have such thoughts if she had more faith!*

Despite every blessing from bishops and stake presidents, every recommendation from doctors who were equally entrenched in the Mormon dog shit, she eventually shot herself. Everyone focused on the depression and said she had gone insane, but we had seen the light dying for some time. Somewhere in her psyche, she had just gotten sick of it all. Several years later, two of my friends from high school also committed suicide. Their families took to social media in the same manner as mine did, spamming spoon-fed remarks of how their loved ones were struggling, weren’t right in the head, and God would have mercy on them.

The sad, stale reality is that this church, which claims to be a place of spiritual/emotional enlightenment and growth for the human soul, has held a vendetta against emotions and spirituality since its conception. It seeks to root out and destroy every beautiful and vibrant trait that makes us human until we are nothing more than emotionally numb and spiritually bland crops to be harvested for the sustenance of egotistical exploiters—power hungry and reactionary old men who either willingly relinquished their humanity a long time ago or had none to begin with (Fuck you, Dallin H. Oaks). If you consider the church’s doctrine, this excruciatingly specific “eternal happiness” is not liberating by any definition. The tiny box it constrains the individual to comes at the cost of every other emotion and piece of humanity you are inherently born with. Some, especially those who are too deep in the beast to get out—though at least part of them may yearn to do so, would rather die than live in such a constricting hell. In truth, many simply cannot survive in such a hell, and if the “wheat from the tares” rhetoric is to be taken literally as some disgusting holy plan designed around spiritual eugenics than the Mormon God is neither loving nor just.

We all need to be there with open arms and the right approach to let these people know we see their suffering and there are more effective ways outside of the church to heal that suffering. We can offer them a way out that doesn’t look so grim and hopeless as the church would frame it. That hump through hell and existential dread one often has to experience in going through a faith crisis frightens many back into the fold and the church has used this to portray “apostasy” as nothing but a steep drop off into misery.

It’s still a gradual thing. I could see anti-LGBT doctrine being grandfathered out, as they have always done in the face of their existential threats like the Civil Rights movement. However, there is still a large market for anti-LGBT rhetoric especially among older folks in the religious right that have one hell of a voice (as we’ve seen with other mega-churches) and with less educated people in developing parts of the world that the church is currently colonizing. The political atmosphere has also been extremely favorable to reactionary blowhards lately in response to liberal politics which could translate over to the religious sector.

One of my mentors worked under Nelson for a decade and I’ve met him in person. From what I’ve gathered, I would guess he, Oaks, other neo-cons like Ballard and Bednar, a number of their loyalists in the Quorum of the Seventy, and corporate/political elite within the church have long been anticipating a soft takeover to usher the congregation into our contemporary age of hyper-capitalism. It’s a genius way to adapt.

Capital now dictates everything, the market is rapidly killing off morals and traditional values, and anyone who refuses to evolve with the rapid change is quickly losing relevancy. They know this.

That being said, the real estate assets alone always appeared to me to be either some kind of rainy day investment project or the ground zero for a future business-related transition the church would grandfather into over the next couple decades or so.

Like everything else in our society, the church is changing and has been changing rapidly since the latter part of the twentieth century. With many among its leadership being successful business types from Friedman‘s time, they must understand by now that the basic, conservative tenets of a bygone era can only last for so long. Anything and everything is now influenced by capital, including faith. The free market economics that many of these men cherish does not distinguish between religious values and private interest, if the product (faith) does not sell, the entity (church) rightfully dies. With the church’s doctrine already instituting a theological take on social Darwinism (ie. tiered heaven), of course they’re going to fortify themselves and fight like hell to remain relevant and “divinely” favored in the corporate realm that now dominates society. We know that corporate mindset has been flowering since Joseph Smith. He too was a business-minded opportunist, and though the cult aspects of the religion killed him and sent the church into a spiral, the church has since recognized this over the past century or so and has gradually navigated further into the original corporate empire strategy.

You need only look at the young people still entrenched in the church and compare them to its older generations to see what I’m talking about. Everything is a business transaction and aspiration for advancement up the ladder of the soul-harvesting machine. There is no line between church and the workplace. Traditional values have been craftily replaced by their new wave successors in neo-conservatism and free market economics, which is about as cutthroat and malicious as capitalism gets. The “church” title now merely hangs as a veneer both to please a still traditional generation that is rapidly dying off and to maintain that extremely beneficial tax-exempt status.

Postmodernism doesn’t lack comprehension of science but rather makes science incomprehensible by questioning everything about it down to its very foundation due to the the arguably flawed perspectives of mankind. It’s a process of writing “Why?” behind anything and everything. There’s no refusal and fear involved other than what refusal and fear some may derive in delving into postmodern philosophy as it obliterates their prior organization of everything. That being said, such individuals still cease to be PoMo when they do not question that fear and refusal because now they’ve settled into a narrative.

The “narcissistic eroticism” thing is bit of an over-generalization. While postmodernism does question everything about traditional sexual behavior, that’s one leaf on a giant tree.

But enough with the turf war bullshit.

Poststructuralism is *not* postmodernism, and though it may have seen its origins in the fragmentation of modernism and traditional structures, values, etc. during the latter twentieth century that did indeed coincided with postmodernism, its organization into its own grand narrative automatically severs it from postmodernism.

Postmodernism essentially rejects ideology, theory, and narratives (which is where the snake eats its own tail) so any of its arguments against individualism would equally apply to collectivism as well. PoMo is as much a backlash against Marxism as it is to traditional values and religion, and locating meaning outside the individual is as much a connecting facet between Foucault and Marx as the “free speech” argument is marrying between your Dr. Peterson and David Duke.

How is the MacIntyre’s argument “language nonsense?” If you’re going to shoehorn him in there, than let’s understand that he clearly admits postmodernism justifies and sustains modern capitalism and, in many regards, he is correct. The break away from traditional narratives generates new trends, new popular ideas, new shit to throw your money at, and keeps the whole damn neoliberal machine moving. Yes, that’s ultimately where PoMo fails in today’s society. Despite its best efforts to break away from modernism and progressivism, new and alternative ideas can always gain popularity and be capitalized on. So how in the hell is that Marxism? Especially when Marxism never seeks to break away from progressivism and modernism but rather works to augment and expand on the two while transitioning away from capital and the market—both of which postmodernism ends up feeding regardless!

Like Free Masonry, the church was built primarily to serve a small number of avaricious men, and the trend still continues.

Too many people feel like they're getting left behind or forgotten by the intellectual community and are therefore doubling down on being simple idiots in preservation of simple and traditional cultures--Mormonism included.

This isn't anything new.  A big part of the Protestant Reformation and the transition into the Baroque was a similar response to the hyper-intellectualism and humanist philosophy of the Renaissance. The Catholic Church had to dumb down the content of their sermons and cater more to emotional experiences.  The commoners could no longer understand what their pompous asshole clergy and academia were going on about and were suddenly seeking more simple/""traditional"" interpretations of Christianity elsewhere.

Sorry for going off on a tangent, but I do think more people need to be aware about why so many ""simple kind of man"" folks are pissed right now.

- Olmecs = Jaredites (their naturalistic representations look Polynesian and absolutely nothing like anyone from the Middle-East, yet this is somehow proof of some connection between Polynesia and Joseph Smith’s fairytale—Mormon nerds love getting off to shit like this).

- Teotihuacanos = Nephites during Christ’s visitation, structures later corrupted by the Gadianton Robbers and Lamanites (hence all of the Pagan gods and such.)

- Quetzalcoatl/Kulkulkan = unquestionable proof that Christ was a part of Mesoamerican culture simply due to the messianic nature of these deities, even though messianic figures appear regularly in cultures and mythologies across the globe (but that only reinforces their “Lost Tribes” bullshit narrative—don’t get them fucking started).

- Cahokia = Last of the Nephites before the Lamanites slaughtered them.

- Mayans = Lamanites during and after Nephite genocide.

- Toltecs and Aztecs = descendants of the Lamanites.

- Everyone else = probably some random offshoots of the Lamanites and yeah, maybe some people came across the Bering Strait and mixed cultures.

- Genetic, archaeological, and anthropological incongruities that disprove all of this nonsense = “So God probably mixed up the Lamanites’ DNA when he cursed them and Satan definitely influenced the people to destroy as much evidence as possible.” (Something along those lines.)

It’s the equivalent of 12-year-old me writing bad fanfiction wherein in I combine the *Star Wars* and *Lord of the Rings* universes with a little bit of *Harry Potter* sprinkled on top, and then try to sell it to my friends as canon. This is the hair-brained—yet somehow accredited—ludicrous rubbish Utah’s academia has been stained with for decades.

That being said, this stuff has thankfully been on its way out with the older generation. The new opinions are more like this: “The evidence for the general academic consensus (reality) is pretty convincing and I’m not sure why God set things up this way, but whether it’s true or not, I know the Book of Mormon has changed my life. That’s all that matters to me.”"

Stephen King could easily scratch it out in his early career (and far more coherently I might add) and hell... even L. Ron Hubbard, another deplorable cult leader, could type out quick and cheap novels within a couple months.

Of course he just rattled it off in spoken word! Most of the plots and characters in the BoM are cheap derivations of biblical figures *and* each other regardless. He spit out the “Book of Lehi” and failed to recite it word-for-word when Harris’s wife hid it. He had the ideas for the plot in his head, so he ran with it, his scribes likely helping him along and revising things as the process continued. Afterwards they sensationalized the process beyond what it truly was, as Mormons have done with nearly every facet of their beginnings, despite historical context and overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Smith wasn’t the only nutcase looking through rocks and burying his face in a hat at the time. His little start-up just happened to be one of the few that carried on. 2 to 3 men making up a story together—588 pages—90 days. It’s absolutely possible regardless of what your *personal experience* would entail.

Gaslighting this sub with one minor talking point, which has already been debated to hell by the CES Letter and pales in comparison to the number of inaccuracies surrounding the BoM, is not going to get you anywhere.

It was a kind of entertainment and something to pass the time, though I never wrote any of it down until I was in my 20’s.

My guess is something similar occurred with Joseph Smith. As far as we know through written account, this “restored church” narrative had been shuffling around in his mind from the age of 14. But as I stated in a previous comment, the comparison between Tolkien’s works and Smith’s works is hilarious.

“Chloroform in print,” Mark Twain pinned it perfectly. It described a robotic experience, *not* the human experience, which even Tolkien’s immortal Noldorin elves came far closer to representing than Smith’s bland, uninspired Nephites. 

A week later, after some skimming through the CES Letter and a desperate prayer to God that of course went unanswered—well... I guess the cold, dead silence *was* an answer—I knew within the deepest part of my soul that it was all a fraud.
