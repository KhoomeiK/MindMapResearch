I think for individuals who don’t experience it they have a hard time understanding and sympathising. 
I’m guessing that’s the same with your partner?

Either way it’s obviously not easy, if you need someone to talk to I’m always just a message away!"

mentalhealth,fqd2far,t3_gi5xk9,1589277373.0,"Please look after YOURSELF!!!!!!! 
I know how difficult it must feel right now!, :( 

It’s not fair that your parents put that pressure on your shoulders but just remember they want what they think is best for you, even if it isn’t.
I suggest to talk to your doctor or look for some online counselling, or even a course online for depression, it might help you to find coping mechanisms! I’ve heard some great things about them from some friends. 
And instead of cutting try drawing on your wrists etc or some other way to deter you from hurting yourself! 

AND REMEMBER YOURE NOT A FAILURE OR ALONE! you tried and that’s the most important thing; 
chase YOUR dreams not anyone else’s. I also think the best thing is to give your parents time, especially after your grandparent passing I can imagine you’re all grieving, and sometimes emotional people take it out on their closest.

So please hold on! And do what makes you happy! 
I’m sorry to hear about your loss and to hear that lifes being difficult at the moment. Pleaseeeeee take care of yourself!!!!!!"

That being said though The Vikings tv show erked me slightly that they made Freydis a slave, like why do you do her like that 🙄😂 I know it’s mostly just appropriation but still 😂

This is actually quite a difficult question to answer! 

I really don’t know hah, I’ve know about the ancestry for a long long time tbh, (just didn’t know who I was related to until now, so I always knew we were related to someone who was norse, my uncle did used to mention Erik the red all the time but when I was younger I didn’t really think much of it) especially in aus i don’t remember ever  learning much about Norse history. But it makes more sense when I view my family now, if that makes sense it’s so hard to explain what I’m talking about arghh hahah. 
But myself? I dont think I ever really knew how to view myself in the first place 😂 


This question is actually doing my head in 😂 
I’m sorry I really don’t know how to answer this question tbh!

(Still Christian but also open to all beliefs and I believe in a lot of things)  Christianity has been in my fam for a longgg time which was more than likely passed on from Leif Eriksson (relation)
