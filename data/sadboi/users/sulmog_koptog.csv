Christianity,exkuc50,t1_exkt3p3,1566399122.0,Not exactly. Besides praying once in a while. There's no one I can talk to and rehab is out of the question. There's not much I can do.
Christianity,exku8h2,t1_exktw6i,1566399057.0,"Yeah initially it was because I was stressed about school. Now it's hard for me to leave the house and not drink, even when there's nothing particularly stressing me."
bipolar2,esmz7fp,t3_c88sc1,1562118696.0,"I wouldn't say I'm having the same experience but it's somewhat similar. Struggled hard in my A levels passed and went to a subpar law school just for the convenience of distance. My first year I was motivated somewhat. I've always been in situations where the ability to pass was purely internal you know, put in the effort, pass. Suddenly this awful uni in a third world country became my nightmare and the greatest trigger for all my mental issues. They lose my marks and somehow it becomes my responsibility to retrieve which is virtually impossible, you get questionable results, the staff are horrible vile assholes who love to intimidate students for whatever the fuck reason. I love law so much but this school has taken me down a spiral of hell-like experiences with my mental illness and alcoholism. But of course everyone else is fine and brush me off."

depression,erkgrul,t3_c2fuf3,1560963122.0,This is true. I'm going through the same thing. And now my dad wants me to get off my meds. Says I should try yoga instead. Amazing. Says maybe I wouldn't be so sad if I got out of my room and socialized more. Somebody explain cause and effect. I'm so tired. Wish they knew how much harder they're making things.
