BPD,fqkj1o6,t1_fqkfzra,1589428400.0,"I feel lame because all of my interests in my childhood were keyed off another person. It's as if I've never had a sense of self. But you are right, I used to volunteer for a cat shelter and I remember really enjoying that as a teen, I suppose I could start there. I think I like art, as I've always been interested in it, but then I don't when I try to get into it, and I can't tell if it's because I don't like it or if it's because of my mental conditions."
BPD,fqkipkk,t1_fqkf714,1589428182.0,The link with that marriage YouTuber is exactly what I've been trying to communicate to my boyfriend as well! I'll bookmark it in case I need material to send if it seems like he doesn't get it. Thank you
BPD,fqkfvms,t1_fqkfidq,1589426415.0,"No problem! I should have mentioned I do enjoy sex and I have a very high libido, but it's only for my partner. So I guess that could count as an interest, but clearly not one I could make friendships off of, lol. I am not sure if it's related to abuse I suffered as a child and an adult, though (like I don't know if it's hypersexuality or if I just have a high libido). 

I am taking Depakote/Valproic acid, but that's more of a mood stabilizer. I just got prescribed Prozac. Do you have experience with either?"
BPD,fqkfenj,t1_fqkf4yd,1589426138.0,"I don't think I've enjoyed anything since early high school. I'm now 23. I still force myself to do things like read, watch shows, etc. but it's only because I feel if I don't I will become out of touch with society. My therapist believes it is because of depression, but it's certainly a long-term case of it as I've overall felt depressed since I was in elementary school."
BPD,fqkceb9,t3_giltnk,1589424403.0,"Okay. About the tears. As a person who cries at everything, I was always scared of being told I'm crying for attention or as a way of manipulation. Therefore, I run away and hide so my partner never sees me cry. How do you deal with crying? It's not even always sobbing, I can be silent and they run down my face."
CalPolyPomona,fiwe3ru,t3_f9kodv,1582782642.0,"Make it look like you aren't alone. As others have said, spread out your belongings, put books on nearby chairs at your table. Or, as I've done, move chairs to other tables before you begin studying.

It's likely the alone part plus you being a woman that makes them think you are approachable even though you don't want them to approach you. I know you have said you don't want to be ""rude"", but consider that many of these people who talk to you, whether on purpose or not, are using the fact you are afraid to seem that way to their advantage. There is a difference between being rude and direct. If they continue to talk to you after you tell them you're studying, it's perfectly valid and not-rude to tell them you'd rather study alone or that you study best alone. You are being honest and not personal to them when you say that."
graphicnovels,fipc29q,t3_f93wae,1582602894.0,"the way I see it in a technical sense is that ""graphic novel"" means a book that was released all at once. For instance, Pride of Baghdad is a graphic novels, because it was released in a bound form. Watchmen is a comic because it was released in issues. 

I think it is silly that graphic novel has been meant to convey some kind of quality to work because that's quite subjective. Superhero comics are a different genre from other kinds of comics, but they're the same medium. A graphic novel can be not that great, after all.

edit: fact-checked re: Maus being a comic vs. graphic novel"
