alcoholism,eyvj1cl,t3_cz1amn,1567496769.0,"I started drinking when I had just turned 14. My first time, I got drunk and fell in love with the feeling. By the time I hit high school, I was a daily drinker, and as school progressed, I began drinking in the morning, during breaks in the school day, etc. 

In my 20s, it progressed further, and I would say it was when I was around 25 I started to see I might have a problem. The signs were, things like people telling me I smelled like alcohol when at work(even after showering and fresh clothes), hands shaking at work, etc. At 28 I finally had the realization that I didn't need to live this way. I quit drinking, cold turkey, and did it the way I had behaved as a drunk, by myself. 

Years later I did go to meetings, which while I didn't do the steps, were very helpful in my recovery. Just seeing all the faces, all types of people, who had the same problem as me was comforting. Fwiw my immediate family has no history of alcoholism. 

Only you can really know if there is a problem, but I would be careful about progression. It sounds as if you are experiencing that now. I am much older than you, and will say, don't throw away your teens/20s on alcohol. It is truly not worth it. I did it. It is a waste, you do not get the years back. Do you want to remember them as they should be, school, fun things with your friends, family, etc? Or as the tireless pursuit of your next drink?"

alcoholism,eymsjgs,t3_cxqg6z,1567218628.0,"It does suck. I am sober 20+ years and still have times I miss it. And am resentful I can't have it. Alcohol was my best friend for 14 years. Always there when I needed it, always ready to wrap me in its warmth. But that friend also wants to destroy me, kill me. When I quit I wrote letters, talked about it in therapy, saying goodbye to that evil friend. 

It did help, but like I say there are still times when I want my old friend back. During those times a quick reality check helps. And I always come back to the facts, I cannot control myself around alcohol, I love it too much. If I drink, I will drink until I am dead. 

Idk of you have looked at AA. I quit on my own, but found AA about seven years later. I learned so much from the groups even though I didn't go through the steps."
alcoholism,eya5y7t,t3_cwb3gv,1566958651.0,"If it helps, I can tell you my experience trying to drink life away. I began suffering from depression at a very young age (7ish). I also have abuse in my past that gives me PTSD like symptoms. 

I began drinking when I turned 14. By the time I was your age I was getting drunk just about every day. I had a couple of further traumas in my late teens/20s (seeing a horrific accident and losing someone important unexpectedly) that furthered my descent trying to numb and forget that and my life up to that point.  I had days I woke up with blood on me that I had no idea where it came from, coworkers would accuse me of drinking because I would be sweating it out, I would show up for 8am classes not having slept all night and still drunk. By my late 20s I was ready to die and got very close to suicide but fortunately had enough clarity one day to realize that I could try not drinking. The hardest thing I have ever done, but I did stop that day. 

Of course my mental health issues didn't clear up from that, but they definitely became a little easier to deal with without being drunk most of the day. I don't say all this for pity, just want to show how it progresses and takes over. There are great therapists and other ways to find support, please seek them out. Don't be like me, looking back on my teens and 20s with regret."

mentalhealth,eya1jjb,t3_cw44j4,1566956708.0,"I have this same cycle sometimes. But if you are on the meds, come off the meds and have anxiety again, you need the meds. Maybe forever or a longer time. 

I spent years resisting meds, being told by providers you need medication, probably for the rest of your life. I resisted. Finally in a bottoming out period I decided to try. Yes, they were right I need meds. And after decades on them, yes, probably for the rest of my life. Unfortunately I still struggle with compliance. But I do believe they are right, I need them, and forever. 

If you are young take care of your mental health. Depressive episodes change your brain. Take your meds if prescribed to minimize these and the change/damage. Don't be like me, now wondering how much better my mental health would be today if I had addressed it when in my teens and 20s.

In my case I can't say envy, as I have persistent depressive disorder, so I can't say I have enough knowledge of what that life might be like to want it. 

Motivation is super hard. I am my own boss, so I especially need to be careful. What works for me (driven by my therapist) are tasks are broken down into small enough pieces that my anxiety isn't triggered. Steps are laid out on paper, so I know what I need to do and by when. The key for me is he helps me mold things based on my issues and personality, instead of going for the ""right thing"" or what I ""should be"" doing.

In the end, he teaches me that despite my issues things have to get done. And like I said before, instead of fighting your issues/personality quirks, try to work with them. For me, that means sometimes working 14 hours multiple days in a week. Not ideal, but the flipside is there are times when my mood makes it difficult or impossible to work, so it helps balance out."

depression,etfdi29,t3_cb5p8h,1562767099.0,"So much of what you wrote hits me, but especially ""I was not made for this world"". When I am in public, that is how I feel. Like I am just in the wrong place or wrong time or something. Looking at the world and people, I just get more baffled and confused with my life, cause I feel so different."
