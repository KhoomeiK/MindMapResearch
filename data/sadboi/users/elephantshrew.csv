Anxiety,fnyxl35,t3_g4hgcb,1587379440.0,"I had a lot of this kind of intrusive thoughts when my social anxiety was at its worst. It would give me  physical and emotional stress each time as I would then ruminate about these very specific awkward situations in the past. Went to talk therapy, and it disappeared."

UnresolvedMysteries,flnmk2g,t3_fpqk6t,1585321712.0,"> After the murder, Donna would see crowds of people and think she saw  Marsi, sometimes chasing them down and saying ""Marsi, come back."" Time  stopped for her after Marsi died. 

That's heartbreaking."

For second hand furniture: there is a bigger depot  just outside the ring in the north, called Ecoshop. Also the Spit kringloopwinkel on the ring in the south is way bigger than the one in Diestsestraat. 
About rooms on higher floors being more expensive: I have never experienced this or heard of it (I have lived here for 8 years now). I honestly just would not rent a room high up in a building like below the roof, since it can get super hot (as it is now) and very few rooms have AC installed."
