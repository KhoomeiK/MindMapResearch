Grew up with my shitty alcoholic father who had no actual interest in raising the children he made. He just made us stay in our room for days on end and let us fight amongst ourselves constantly; summertimes were hell for me. I really needed school for food and any social interaction, even though I mainly got made fun of in school. Then I got older and kids in school kept getting more cruel and my home life never improved. It just kept going from normal shitty to points where it was really shitty. Then I went into fostercare and if you’re not pretty and outgoing or a cute little kid and able to take a bullshit from everyone without complaining, you’re screwed. How ugly I am really affected my foster care experience and the fact that I’m introvert and had very little and poor socialization in my life. I lived with a pair of foster parents for 2 years and they treated me like garbage. That was even more trauma on top of my other trauma. Now I’m 21 and my mom was schizophrenic and I’ve got symptoms of schizophrenia. I honestly think I was always meant to be alone because I can still barely socialize (and I know for a fact I’m not autistic, just was never taught during key stages of life), I’m ugly as hell, and if I develop schizophrenia, no one will want to partner with me ever.  I’ve felt pretty hopeless lately, but I cling to maybe it maybe not developing more, like I’ve got severe paranoia and had some hallucinations but mainly when I’m trying to sleep, and the more stressed or depressed I get the worse it gets, but I’m not diagnosed.

A sliding geniolasty will have like 1-2 mm of erosion I think(?) v an implant like up to 6. Here are some [SG](https://imgur.com/a/FTUdXgF). You can see it can greatly improve a jawline. It’s more of a natural way of augmenting the chin than an implant. Either way you should consult a good maxillofacial surgeon who might tell you no and they will be wayyyy better than some idiots on the Internet. Consult one before a plastic surgeon though absolutely. Let them to you what’s best because they know. A plastic surgeon won’t necessarily tell you what’s best. Also if you go with a SG have a maxillofacial surgeon do it obviously. Ask about sliding genioplasty v implant and why you have the characteristics you don’t like. Fillers are temporary and cost more in the long run and I believe it takes more over time leading to pillow face. Def consult a professional and don’t let anyone on this sub get you down. You look good. We aren’t all Hollywood stars with perfect bone structure like incels think we should be.

PlasticSurgery,fkxgpf4,t1_fkxaqft,1584627776.0,"Incels frequent this sub and their number one thing to recommend for literally anyone and everyone is Jaw surgery no matter what. They think everyone needs it but they don’t understand the risks, costs, recovery. You should see a good maxillofacial surgeon when considering anything with the chin, but they’ll look at you and assess their bone structure and airways as a professional, tell you the risks and whether jaw surgery is right for you. A lot of people do that and then never get jaw surgery because the surgeon doesn’t recommend it and they’ll refer you to a plastic surgeon, but it’s still worth going so you know how your face and airways are set up. Had a friend who got jaw surgery and it took her 10 years to get it approved through insurance even though she couldn’t breathe right or taste at all and had literally no chin (she kind of barely has a chin now). The bill was like 97k before insurance kicked in and she still had to pay for a small portion of it and her braces. The recovery is rough as hell too. They literally break your skull and rearrange it. A sliding genioplasty, they still cut your chin bone and slide it and that sounds scary, but it’s nowhere near as bad as double jaw surgery although there are risks. A sliding genioplasty would probably help you have a better jawline as it can have reallly good results just look around on this sub for some. But either way, a professional maxillofacial surgeon can tell you what’s up and why your face looks the way it does and then tell you where to go from there.

schizophrenia,fkn606f,t3_fjgpkk,1584355009.0,"I don’t know the word for this one. But I think a common delusion I’ve had is that I’ve murdered people. I had a dream once where I walked out of our apartment, wandered on the road, flagged down a car and they asked me where I wanted to go. I said the airport because I had never been. I went to the airport, wandered around dodging security and was able to sneak on a random plane and got in the luggage. It landed later (I don’t remember the flight v well or sneaking out). I was on the street again in a random neighborhood panicked. All the houses looked the same, they were tan with fences and tan gravel and light dry plants. I walked for a while and tried some doors until I found a back door that was open and creeped around went upstairs found a girl younger than me (8). Yada yadda I drowned her in the pool. It goes on. That was one of the most vivid dreams I’ve ever had, the parts I remember now I mean. I remember  waking up the next morning and my hair was wet and I told my dad I needed to call the police on myself and begged him and he told me to shut up (he ignored all of my episodes). I lived so guilty for so long because of this. Then in my early middle school, the Casey Anthony thing happened and I was convinced it was me. I remember waking the mom and she panicked and I gave her our phone number and ran. I felt like I needed to tell them I did it. I felt like I didn’t deserve anything and I was so horrible. This intertwined with my OCD and ticks and I went around mumbling I killed Casey Anthony’s daughter. I felt like I needed to turn myself in to the authorities and I stopped giving myself things like taking care of myself and trying in school. I can remember it so vividly and it still gives me anxiety like it happened like it’s in my memories and I know I did that and that’s why she didn’t go down and I could go on forever about the details. But as I got older, how the fuck is an 8 year old going to sneak into airport security, why didn’t those guys in that black Jeep call the cops instead of taking me wherever I wanted??? Why didn’t that mom kill me after I killed her daughter or try and tell the police even if it was crazy?  I could’ve showered the night before and that’s why my hair could’ve been wet. Sneaking through a large airport in Orlando as a little kid seems unlikely even though my local one is a hillbilly shit show and it doesn’t take long to get to Orlando from where I live. Like I remember researching flights and how long it takes to get there and whether it’s be possible. My dad wouldn’t have known if I was gone because he was always passed out and didn’t pay attention to us. Either way yeah I’ve had dreams leak in my memories and I KNOW they happened but kind of have to tell myself they didn’t. Like when you see the sky is blue and you know it and everyone else tells you it’s red so you gotta be like yeah sure red and try and convince yourself but it’s always been blue to you and you still know it’s blue."

schizophrenia,fkl9vmz,t3_fj1xwx,1584301671.0,"I think I do something similar to this, but not exactly. Like I’ve been using daydreaming as a cope, but it’s so vivid and I make up my own little world and sometimes what I imagine is complicated and intertwined and sometimes it’s just one that’s by itself I’m gonna say. Like if I don’t like a situation, I imagine another situation that I liked better and it’s like I forget what’s real almost completely. Sometimes these “fantasies” get mixed in with my real memories and I can’t tell if they happened or not because some are so vivid and realistic at the same time. Sometimes I imagine things that are absolutely morbid and horrible like the worst possible situation that could happen to me and it affects my emotions like it was real regardless of what life is like outside. I have had a hard time living in reality an end I was in elementary school. I have memories that I don’t think really happened like murdering people, but it’s realistic and vivid and I thought happened but little  else points to it realistically having happened. Now I’m impulsive and I have random episodes pop in my head. Does this sound similar? Maybe I didn’t explain it well enough like it’s creating a huge problem in my life and I’m worried I can’t explain it well enough to my psychiatrist and she won’t take it seriously. The closest thing that I have seen describe it is maladaptive daydreaming, but I think the line blurring between my real memories and emotions and fake memories and emotions caused by the fake memories is something else. Like I feel like my grip on reality isn’t great sometimes. And I think I can send myself into depressive episodes or psychosis and may actually be giving myself trauma because it’s so real to me. I’m starting to realize how much damage I’m doing to myself so I’m trying to live in reality. I also have ticks like have to repeat horrible phrases and movements.

Off youre hallucinating and experiencing delusions and a host of other things and on you just sleep and don’t do anything and apparently can’t function? This doesn’t sound right. If that’s how the threatment is going, you’d think they’d try something else, not call that success. How’s that life?"

fosterit,fjin9h6,t1_fjin1b9,1583371374.0,My foster parents got almost like almost 1000 for me + clothes stipends because they were a therapeutic licensed foster family at a private agency in poor sw Virginia. Plus some people get WIC and or food stamps for the kids. Like I hate when people generalize and say no one does it for the money. You know damn well some do it even for whatever they’re given and don’t use it on the kids. They collect kids and take the check to save up for a down payment on a car or something and then get rid of the kids.
fosterit,fjiili4,t1_fjihzx1,1583368437.0,"It’s not anti foster parent bullshit. It’s anti bad foster parent memes. Sounds like a shoe fit and you’re offended that it did. Also, this sub has plenty of bullshit from shitty foster parents or prospective foster parents posted all the time. That’s why this sub is in bad shape lmao. Literally the meme says “unfit” and “bad foster parents” like..."

Frugal,fjb1g6c,t3_ey9o1j,1583184628.0,Just for an update in case some one else has this question. You do NOT include it on the FAFSA. We called the FAFSA hot line and I think it was question 44 that said do not include include extended fostercare benefits in the informational pop up. I’m glad I didn’t. It would have messed up my aid a lot.
HealthInsurance,fjb143f,t1_fhystez,1583184443.0,Thanks for this reply again.  I changed my insurance because it’s turns out I was in my open enrollment until the 28th. I met with the free assister and I got dental insurance up until $525 which is better than nothing by switching plans. I also found out that my insurance is not dependent on my income having aged out of fostercare which is great. Thanks again.

I will most likely be majoring in accounting, but I’m trying to consider any other majors that might be worth it. I’m considering a business administration, risk assessment and insurance or dental hygiene major.

insaneparents,fis3wir,t1_firye0e,1582677209.0,"I can guarantee you that any orphan/ fostercare system in the world is going to have issues. They “screen” families carefully in the US too. I’m not trying to invalidate your pain, but I am telling you fostercare would have most likely added on more trauma to the trauma you already had. Fostercare is not like the movies. There is no love. Even those “sweet” adoptions you see on TV by “saints” adopting little kids get disrupted and those people throw the kids back into fostercare if they shows signs of being ungrateful, having issues, wanting to know their birth family, doing normal pre teen and teen things like trying pot or sneaking out or just having an attitude. People don’t pay attention to that part though. No I’m not trying downplay your trauma, but don’t dismiss mine. Research your fostercare system and it’s issues before you fantasize that it’s any better."
insaneparents,fiqkgqu,t1_fiqipsp,1582646226.0,"Yep, the in home crap almost never works. We had it before I went in and we had a therapist and the therapist would let our father talk over my brother and call him a lair. My brother couldnt talk about any of the abuse because my father was always there and he’d get punished if he did. They just made my father a contract to sign saying he wouldn’t do this or that like that fucking did anything. CPS is a god damn mess but so is fostercare. There’s nothing good but holding onto the life you’ll have as an adult. I’m much happier now and I’ve let a lot of things go. I have an apartment, a job, a car, can afford certain things I like and am thinking about going back to school in the fall. Hold on and know that when you turn 18, the best thing you can do to make them suffer is never speak to them again and let them die alone."
insaneparents,fiqjiew,t1_fiqizks,1582645651.0,"Unless they’re beating you and torturing you like not feeding you or letting you sleep and confining you to a closet or something and not letting you have clean clothes, it’s not better. It’s more traumatic to have strangers do it to you. I can tell you 100% that you will be gaslit like you have never before and called a liar and they can do anything they want almost to you in fostercare. The agency will call you a liar if you speak up, everyone will brown nose the foster parents because they’re foster parents and tell them “god bless you” and look at you dirty for claiming they did this or that. Foster kids are automatically labeled liars and foster parents do not have to take blame for anything they do. It’s shit. And if you’re older, you’ll end up in a group home and you don’t even want to think about that. It’s hard to explain to people how incredibly horribly traumatic foster care is. You don’t understand the loneliness and the desire to die until you’ve been in care. It’s it’s own special brand."

insaneparents,fipwhy1,t1_fipu3eo,1582625044.0,"CPS doesn’t care much for emotional abuse whatsoever. They’ll rarely even touch cases if a kid has a middle class looking life. People realllllllyyy don’t understand CPS, first they’ll do in home stuff and then if it’s really bad, they’ll remove the child, but calls to CPS do if often result in punishment for the child by the parents."
