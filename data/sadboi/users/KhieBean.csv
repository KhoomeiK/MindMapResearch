DeathStranding,f6nhr12,t1_f6mg3z7,1572991777.0,"Each influencer has a card with words/ numbers/ plank circles or all of the above. There's a single yellow circle on three of the influencer's cards, I thought we needed to connect four yellow circles to numbers to get a four number pin. But Janina doesn't have any circles, her card simply reads [""WHERE IS ALL STARTED""](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/599216420873568266/641396516962959400/image0.jpg). 

Ronfunch's card has a date on it May 29th, 2019. Which is the date [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8X7vM3Avw) was posted."

mentalhealth,eqsfj7z,t1_eqselcd,1560283737.0,"Uhm.. pardon? What about what I said was rude? I just wanted to explain that I didn’t mean it sarcastically, I typed and retyped my comment so many times trying to not offend anyone, I was trying to make it clear that I fully support and congratulate his success. 
I really didn’t feel comfortable commenting on it in the first place because every time I changed my comment it seemed insincere. But I really felt the need to comment, because I wasn’t sure if anyone else would, and I needed him to know that he’s done a fantastic job. 
No, people aren’t a joke to me, I was up all night commenting and offering my help to people on this subreddit. People like you are a joke though, taking offense on the behalf of other people when there’s nothing to take offense to in the first place, people who are dedicated to seeing the negativity in everything, even when there is no negativity at all!"

mentalhealth,eqqn4dt,t1_eqqlwbn,1560225540.0,"The thing is, I dream of living in a van, driving around all over Europe. But because of my anxiety, depression and economic situation, that dream seems so far away, and I give up on the idea a lil bit with every week that passes. So I was hoping a small roadtrip would help refuel my love and interest for vanlife. Before it completely disappears like so many other dreams and ambitions I’ve had in the past."
mentalhealth,eqqlaj7,t3_bz70id,1560224004.0,"That’s great! 
I planned my first solo vacation about a year ago, but haven’t gone yet, it’s just a road trip across the country. Denmark (where I live) is small, it wouldn’t even take a full day to drive from east to west. I guess I’m just not ready yet, I’m gonna put the idea back on the shelf till I’m ready."
mentalhealth,eqqkfdm,t3_bz7bmh,1560223378.0,It’s frustrating. People are self diagnosing and making anxiety a trend. Makes it difficult for us who actually suffer from anxiety and depression to be taken seriously.
mentalhealth,eqqk222,t3_bz7524,1560223118.0,"Talk to a therapist! Get your frustrations out, talk to someone who can’t gossip behind your back. If you go to vent to a family member or friend, the word might spread and get back to your wife, which I can’t imagine would help her situation. 
Best of luck!

Edit: Don’t feel bad for being frustrated! It’s okay."

mentalhealth,eqqatsm,t3_bz5rv9,1560216689.0,"You’re not forever alone, not having a partner doesn’t mean you’re alone. There’s someone for everybody, but you have to be ready for it, and often times when you stop pursuing and searching that’s when you’ll find what you’ve always wanted and deserve. You can go to bars and talk to guys and girls all you want, sure you can find love there, but it’s often when you just mind your own business, do the things you like, you’ll meet someone who also likes those things and you just click. It’s also okay to not want a partner at all, but if you don’t, it’s important for you to remember that that doesn’t make you forever alone. I hope you find happiness, either with or without a partner. 💕"
mentalhealth,eqq9v4r,t3_bz5y67,1560215942.0,I’m so socially awkward I don’t know how to let you know you’ve done a great job without it sounding awkward or sarcastic. But I want you to know that you’ve done a great job!
mentalhealth,eqq9479,t1_eqq8j9c,1560215360.0,"It sounds to me like you’ve got too much going on right now. It may be stress? You definitely shouldn’t feel stupid! Try switching your brain off for a moment, do something that doesn’t require a lot of thought, put some of your favorite music on and doodle on some paper, play a mobile game or make a cup of tea and watch some YouTube. Allow the fog to take over for a second. A lot of times when I feel stressed I can’t think straight cause I’ve got so much brewing in my head at once, allowing it to just do its thing for a moment can help make it easier to shove aside later."
mentalhealth,eqq8dho,t3_bz5vkq,1560214789.0,"What kind of fog? Like you’re disconnected from the world around you, it doesn’t feel real and sorta like a dream? Or foggy like you can’t collect your thoughts?"
mentalhealth,eqq7w7d,t1_eqq7jem,1560214427.0,"Oh also! If you’re feeling particularly distant or foggy in your head, finger painting is great! Feeling the texture of the paint and paper/canvas can really help bring you out of your head and back into your body."
mentalhealth,eqq7jem,t3_byt3it,1560214152.0,"I did this with imaginary friends, they had names G, K and M. G was the friendliest and funniest, so I wanted to give her voice and personality a face, I tried to sketch her many times, but the sketches never felt or looked right, but at the time I was watching a lot of doll sculpting videos on YouTube, so I went out, bought clay, and just let my hands do their thing. I was really happy with the result, I still have her, even though she hasn’t been with me for a few years now."
