The last thing any of us wants is to go back to the fucking hospital. If someone knew how to use that to their advantage, they'd pretty much have control over me. I think you need to completely cut him out of your life. I think if I were you I'd even take a break from all of these other people for a while after explaining what he did in as calm a way as possible.
