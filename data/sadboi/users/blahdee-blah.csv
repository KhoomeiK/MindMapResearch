Thritis,fqssns0,t3_gkp0n3,1589617452.0,"I’m a 44 year old woman who has finally had my first knee replacement surgery in February (thankfully just before lockdown), and I can see some similarities in our stories. 

I’m in the U.K. so probably some differences in access to treatments.  Like you, I had a congenital problem with walking (mine was short Achilles’ tendons so I walked on my toes, heels wouldn’t reach the ground).  For years (in the 70s and early 80s) the medical response was always ‘she’ll grow out of it’.   My mum says I used to cry in pain at night,  but I don’t remember that.  When I was 10 my mum (dad was in the navy so he was at sea) refused to leave the doctor’s surgery until he made a referral (go mum!). 

So at 10 I was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for the first time.  Within 6 weeks I was in surgery. Then I had to learn to walk again, but I could do it normally, hurrah!  I tell this story because I am certain that the rest comes from it.  By 12 I was in dreadful pain with my back (I used to lie on the floor at the back of the classroom) and it turned out I had a bulging disc because my back curves out too much at the bottom - I got my first ever prescription for co-codamol (only the low dose, for occasional use), and a physio course called ‘back school’ where a group of us learnt exercises and how to manage our backs (thanks nhs - I still use that advice). I think I’d just 13 so they gave the ‘how to have sex with a bad back’ leaflet to my mum!  

So I got on with things, got an office job out of uni, managing my back.  Then the knees started - knowing what I know now, my kneecaps were dislocating most days (I have a flat groove on my tibia so those little buggers won’t stay put).  I had huge problems getting treatment (apparently women ‘just have painful knees’ ugh).  One of my more recent consultants says he wishes he’d seen me then because they could have done preventative surgery. Ah well.  At 30 I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis, which deteriorated very rapidly (again, now I realise that I was dislocating my kneecaps a lot).   

I heard the ‘you’re too young, but you need surgery’ line a lot.  Because revisions get increasingly difficult and the replacements wear out.  Finally last year I was loaded up on all the pain relief and just couldn’t cope any more, so the surgery was agreed. I’ve only had a partial replacement which the consultant intends to convert (I think in about 10 years, but I haven’t been able to see anyone to ask questions - thanks Coronavirus).  I’ve asked for number 2 to be done ASAP. 


So, having said that, here’s what I’ve learnt over the past 15 years...  

Look after your mental health. I’ve had 3 or 4 rounds of counselling, first time because I was absolutely furious. It’s unfair. It’s horrible, and it gets bloody boring.  I had some fantastic psychological support as well and, although we get pissed off with people telling us to try mindfulness, it is a useful tool in the box.   I’ve had antidepressants a couple of times. It’s not surprising if your mental health suffers in our situation. 

The pregnancy issue. That’s a toughie. I asked advice of a senior specialist lower limb physio.  We went through the scenarios with both my back (which has to be protected otherwise the disc will go again) and my knees.  That allowed me to make an informed decision. I was also looking after my nephew at the time and carrying him was tough, my knees kept giving way.  My husband and I decided not to. I’d rather be a great aunt than a miserable mum.  But the first time one of our friends got pregnant (who was my age), I sobbed for a day.  Now, we enjoy the freedoms of our child-free life, but I think asking the questions and taking control helped with that.  I was also once told that if we had had a child they might have operated on me sooner if I couldn’t look after the baby, but I don’t have confirmation of that. 

I did find that I got better at managing the pain and living with it.  But also make sure you get the right gp - that’s fundamental.  Here in the U.K., our clinical guidelines state that there is no lower age level for joint replacement surgery. I became very knowledgeable about the research and rules and I wasn’t afraid to use them (once starting with ‘I am aware that women with chronic conditions, including arthritis, are less likely to have their symptoms taken seriously than men with the same symptoms’ (that’s some depressing research). For me, knowledge is power so I would ask for every letter that goes back to my primary gp also gets copied to me - I’ve googled a lot but I know a lot more about my condition now.  

You’re in this for the long term, so taking what control you can is important. Support groups are really important. You’ll find that young OA people aren’t that common compared to those with inflammatory conditions. I’ve always been grateful that my arthritis was limited to one area,  but at the same time that doesn’t minimise the impact on my life.  There’s great wisdom to be found in support groups.

Sorry that’s been really long. I hope you are doing ok"

Writeresearch,fpjhdhv,t1_fpjainj,1588668550.0,"Yes the emotional/psychological side is huge.  I didn’t realise that I was livening in a constant state of anxiety until they put me on pregablin and it took it all away. I was walking on air for days until I realised that I just wasn’t anxious any more.

It’s the constant worry - when I get there, can my schonky joints manage the environment? Will there be a lot of steps? Can I sit down? Will I have a flare up? What if I fall? (These are specific to my disability, obviously)

It would be unsurprising to have some depression at some point when you’re in constant pain and can’t do normal things. For me it was watching things I took for granted ebbing away.  I went to counselling at one point because I was absolutely furious about my situation.  Because it’s really not fair.  Had great psychology sessions via the nhs once though - including mindfulness which is surprisingly helpful"
Writeresearch,fpjgzh4,t1_fpjcchr,1588668132.0,"Not OP but another person who lives with chronic pain. I work through pain now that would have sent me to bed 2 years ago, it’s just normal. I had a knee replacement in Feb and yesterday it was burning when I woke up.  Had to consciously remind myself it’s not supposed to feel like that anymore and that I needed to think about what I’d done and rest.  

I think it’s different for people. I am quite bullish now and don’t like to give in to it.  That’s not an entirely healthy attitude and I’ve made some miscalculations with work which nearly led me to a breakdown; when you’re pushing to your absolute max and something gets added, it’s not great"
Writeresearch,fpjgoup,t1_fpippy6,1588667821.0,"You can get paracetamol with a small amount of codeine (500 mg paracetamol and 8 mg of codeine per tablet) only from a pharmacist and you are told strictly not to use it for more than 3 days.  It’s not particularly strong, but good if you’ve caught your back or something.  

Anything else is by prescription and the strong stuff is classed as a controlled drug.   I had to sign an agreement around sensible use of medication when they prescribed me something once.  

I’ve been sent home from surgery with a handful of tramadol (carefully measured for the first few days), a big box of paracetamol and some ibuprofen. 

If you have chronic pain it’s not as bad as in the US where people have all sorts of difficulties getting their medication now, but the pharmacist will pull you in for a review if you have repeats of anything opioid and you have to discuss with the GP at least every 6 months to re-issue the script. Just in case anyone has any writerly curiosity..."

Can’t wait to have them both done!  It’ll be fun to see how good my energy/concentration is once I’m off all the drugs, and I look forward to being able to manage longer writing stints :)

I could have written some great stories after the morphine if I wasn’t so out of it! They give it to you in liquid form in hospital after joint replacement and I could honestly feel my face slipping into a goofy smile. My parents thought it was hilarious!"

I was really anxious about addiction but my doctor told me that you don’t tend to get addicted when you use them properly for pain.  He said it’s mostly people who use them to get to sleep or are prescribed too many, too strong etc that get addicted. I wasn’t sure having been grilled about buying the over the counter co-codamols so I used to take a weekend break every so often and I never had any issues. I’ve gradually increased my doses (tolerance and increased pain) but still always been able to go without apart from a really nasty pain weekend.  Now I’m on patches so it’s a constant dose so I can’t really do that, although I have occasionally changed them late. I’m gradually reducing the dose at the moment and again, no withdrawal symptoms.  But I could be a lucky one..."
Writeresearch,fphc7kr,t3_gdgd8f,1588618682.0,"Depends.  For info I have dislocatey knees riddled with arthritis and have been on a range of opioid medications for years, including some pretty strong stuff to keep me working.  Happy to answer where I can.

One thing I have experienced when meds have been increased (got a new kneecap in Feb so had morphine, for example) is that I get crazy vivid dreams. Mine were enjoyable but I’ve known other people say theirs were frightening. 

Other small things include dry mouth, a bit of a fluffy head maybe (day-dreams and the like).  I don’t know if you’ll want to talk about constipation but that’s pretty much a given after a while for a lot of people... I do like a nap when I have to take a lot of the pain killers, and I sometimes lose my words when I have to think on my feet.

Oh, and just to add. They will send you home with the minimum possible pain killers in the U.K. . Definitely an anti-inflammatory (not sure which country you are in - UK would be ibuprofen)."
