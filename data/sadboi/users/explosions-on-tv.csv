LedZeppelinCirclejerk,fko0byx,t3_fjk5bu,1584377581.0,Probably biased because I‚Äôm a huge Zep fan but I think they‚Äôre ridiculous.. the biggest argument is that people like that this music is ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùcoming back‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù but there‚Äôs some legit copying/plagiarism happening I think. They‚Äôre biggest song ‚Äúhighway tune‚Äù sounds almost identical to the Rover. There‚Äôs no denying they‚Äôre talented and the singer has a killer voice but it‚Äôs just too uncanny for me. Then they act all cocky in interviews when asked who they‚Äôre inspirations are and they say Aerosmith and what not. Big eh for me :/

It was really helpful for me and definitely leaned more towards feeding in the enclosure but the gist was that all snakes are different and what might work for your snakes might be different for another.

I‚Äôm not posting ‚Äúa cutesy caption‚Äù in order to karma farm, the caption I posted was accurate and to the point.

In no part of my post did I ask for any of that, stop making assumptions. ‚ÄúNot saying I know a fraction of anything about art‚Äù yet you‚Äôre in ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùart school‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù trying to talk about what‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù and ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù. We are both the same age, this is sad. Go contribute to society instead of waving your dick around. if you don‚Äôt like her art, nobody fucking asked.
