In middle school they had me see a pediatric urologist who said it was probably related to hydration/fiber intake/pooping. So then they had me taking laxatives daily, overhydrating, wearing diapers at night (they literally sent me off to college with a bag of diapers), making me take extra laxatives on top of the daily ones, and saying they were going to give me enemas if the extra laxatives didn’t work. This didn’t really work, and they fearmongered me like “if this routine isn’t working you’ll have to get a lot of surgeries- so it’s not working because you’re not following it closely enough, right???”

It’s so weird how the bedwetting problem cleared up completely after I moved out of their house!

Anyway, anyone know if bedwetting in older children might be linked to sexual abuse? Because that was a thing that happened but I never told my parents about it because I was sure they’d think I was lying and get mad at me."

I think it’s awesome that you can be stealth. I haven’t seen anyone get seriously angry that other trans people have it easier. At most it’s a wistfully jealous “I wish I could do that” because we all face various obstacles and struggles for being trans no matter how “passing” or “easy” we think we have it relative to other trans people.

There will (almost) always be someone with a harder life. I try to help change their situation—whether that’s through broader activism or direct support—instead of needlessly making my own experience harder for myself."
