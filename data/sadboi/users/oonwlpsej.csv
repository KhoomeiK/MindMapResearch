AskReddit,fq1wt93,t3_ggdivs,1589050522.0,"I am now 18, and ever since, ive never been serious enough on academics. I have been studying but i feel it wasn't enough although every year i am always an academic awardee and i join contests. People really think i am smart, that i am an ideal girl because of my intelligence but i believe otherwise. 

I have been having a career goal since 8th grade (being q doctor) and been into science-y stuffs. But 3 years after, I felt like im going into deeper knowledge without even knowing the basics.

Ever since the start of quarantine, March, I have been spending my time studying the past year's lessons and watching youtube educational videos. 

I know that this isn't much of a big deal but i just want to comment and be proud of myself. I have such a hard time, and I could cry just thinking that I am able to have something to be motivated at since I have had a hard time and undergone through series of anxiety attacks, depression, ive been so suicidal (if it weren't for my friends & my bf, i would have had killed myself) and i ran out of motivation. It really feels great being able to get out of that phase."

I am sometimes in a dilemma between wanting to die and wanting to live. I've got so much to live fore especially my loved ones. But my mind tells me otherwise. My good days are intermittent and one of the interval is now and ive not beet thinking of dying. 

Being able to read your story intensifies the feeling i have of continuing to live. I am not relieved by your situation, I hope this didn't happen but I have no control, and neither do you. The good thing is that you chose to influence others by not telling directly what to do but letting us try to feel you and eventually influencing our conscious/subconscious, and I so much appreciate that. I know that these people in the comments, and who have read this feel influenced as I do. You are unknown to all of us but you are making such a great impact. You lived your purpose, maybe, and may you still continue to live according to your purpose (if consciously unknown, then continue to seek) even knowing the time you have left.

It may not be fine right now, just let it be, for now, i guess, but i sure do hope that it will get better (maybe not soon but time comes for sure), we (the people around you, your fam, friends, ppl reading this) all do. .

I can't say any other thing rather than just hoping you and to other who has felt the same way to be better. May you have again the will to go on, may you bring back yourself or change or live up to what you have taught from your gf. I know you are really not in a good condition, and while reading this, you may think that ""that's impossible"" or ""its too hard.""
