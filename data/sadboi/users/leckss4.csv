AskReddit,fjb8klp,t1_fjb7vnj,1583188644.0,Right? I‚Äôve never had this issue before in my life. I always figured guys always cum. So this has really thrown me.
AskReddit,fjb8hyh,t1_fjb7x4f,1583188601.0,I feel like you being transparent and telling them that is awesome! I‚Äôd get super in my head if they hadn‚Äôt cum after a while and assume it was my fault and stop enjoying the sex.
AskReddit,fjb8br5,t1_fjb7ypq,1583188502.0,"Both like 30, sex lasted like half an hour maybe?"
AskReddit,fjb6n0t,t3_fck4on,1583187532.0,"To explain - I‚Äôm (25 F) freaking out a little. The last three guys I‚Äôve been with have seemed to be enjoying sex, but then didn‚Äôt cum. The first guy told me this was a problem he had before we ever had sex - so I didn‚Äôt take it personally... but since there has now been two more I‚Äôm actually terrified that there‚Äôs something wrong with me or that my body is suddenly unattractive or that maybe I‚Äôm doing something weird and not knowing it. 

For context, I‚Äôm not laying there like a starfish, They‚Äôve all seemed super attracted to me and initiated sex and stayed hard and seemed really into the sex. When it comes to cumming though the last two said something along the lines of ‚Äúi don‚Äôt think I can cum at the moment‚Äù 

How common is not cumming? Is it usually because you‚Äôre not attracted to your partner? SOS"

BipolarReddit,f92w2q1,t3_e31uj8,1575043352.0," There‚Äôs a book called the bipolar disorder survival guide that I forced (asked) all of my family members to read. It‚Äôs helped them to understand a lot! It‚Äôs written by a psychiatrist and it explains everything from what bipolar is on a scientific level, to possible symptoms, to showing that bipolar people can live normal, meaningful lives. It even has a section for family on things that might be more hurtful vs. Helpful! 

I‚Äôd recommend it"
AskLosAngeles,f8xl64z,t3_e2j9fw,1574922533.0,"I work at an ad agency in media buying. My rent is 1500 a month for a room in a very nice house and eats up most of my pay, but I just buy groceries more than eating out and spend my weekends hiking or outdoors with friends which is both fun and almost free (where I already own all of that gear and my only real cost is gas if I drive somewhere).  

I also have my parents who I could rely on if some emergency expense came up (Ie. registering my truck in LA was ridiculously expensive, some kind of medical expense etc)- if I didn‚Äôt have that safety net I‚Äôd be a lot more nervous about money and would probably live in a much less expensive place."

curlyhair,f7gokzl,t1_f7go7ir,1573710701.0,"To be honest I don‚Äôt really have one! I do a face mask like once a week (sometimes twice). It‚Äôs a super cheap one that I found, but I love it and it exfoliates my skin and makes my pores noticeably smaller. It‚Äôs the freeman brand - Apple cider vinegar mask.  

Other than that I just use face lotion daily. My dermatologist recommended this face cream called nutraseb. It‚Äôs a game changer!

Also thank you!!"
curlyhair,f7gg2ju,t3_dw367v,1573702850.0,My curls only look good for like 3 days. After that point they get frizzy from sleeping on them and also look less soft - if that makes sense.

curlyhair,f7ex3kw,t3_dvvaxb,1573667695.0,"I posted the routine in the caption but 
1. Shampoo with oribe shampoo for brilliance and shine 
2. Condition with oribe conditioner for brilliance and shine (make sure to get it ALL out! The products are really intense - even though they feel lightweight - so if you don‚Äôt get it all out, it‚Äôll look greasy and dirty) 
3. Brush your hair in the shower while very wet 
4. Get out of the shower and scrunch a bit of oribe curl butter. Use your fingers and run through the top of your hair too & by your face (so it doesn‚Äôt get frizzy up there either) 
5. Lightly scrunch with a towel to slightly dry if you have to! 
6. Leave it alone! Legit until it‚Äôs totally dry. Don‚Äôt play with it or brush it or touch it. If you‚Äôre driving keep your windows up

bipolar,f6oimqz,t3_ds5bey,1573019239.0,"I found a book i loved called the bipolar disorder survival guide. It was the first book that I found that showed bipolar in a frank, medical way AND talked at length about how most people who are diagnosed bipolar can go on to live perfectly normal fulfilling lives. 

I asked everyone in my family to read it. There‚Äôs chapters for family members, helping them to understand scientifically what‚Äôs happening to me and how they might be helping or hurting. It‚Äôs helped them to understand a lot. 

Other than that, I continue to be VERY careful who I tell - because once you tell you can‚Äôt untell & I hate the idea of people discounting my thoughts or feelings and labelling them symptoms when I‚Äôm medicated and damn stable. 

Hope that helps!"

The attraction element makes a relationship different from just a friend. It‚Äôs important to any relationship & it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person to want that. There‚Äôs literally nothing more you can do though. She needs to find that motivation and desire to get healthy for herself.

When I‚Äôm low I feel like I can connect with the world and with people on this really profound level, just by observing.

I‚Äôm a photographer and being able to see what someone hates about themselves or what someone wants to be seen/ tries to hide discreetly like is super useful for me.
