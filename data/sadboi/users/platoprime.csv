>an act of selecting or making a decision when faced with two or more possibilities.

There's nothing there about both *decisions* being possible simply that there is one to be made. Even a computer makes a choice when it follows an algorithm. Determining if it should follow the if or the then of an if/then is a choice.

Perhaps you think a choice is something that if you were given two chances to pick you might choose differently? Like if we replayed the Universe you could make different choices? That's not choice. That is randomness. By this definition of choice then a die chooses which face to land on. That is obviously preposterous.

The reason choices are meaningful is because you make choices for reasons. You think murder is wrong so you don't kill people. If you could replay your life with the possibility that you'd randomly decide to be a serial killer that would cause both decisions to be completely devoid of the meaning of choice."

It's perfectly fine to get emotional about math and history. I find plenty of aspects of math frustrating or evocative of beauty and wonder.

> Its not apologizing for, excusing or minimizing rape to say, ""in the morals and context of the time this was consensual. 

Justifying how rape isn't *really* rape is absolutely excusing and minimizing rape. How is it possible to be this self-unaware? 

It's ironic that you insult my ability to be ""academic""(did you mean rational?) 

>Its just math. 

This is intellectually dishonest horse-shit. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself for conflating slave rape not being slave rape with mathematical truths. There is no mathematical alogrithm to describe consent and if there was it would not include variables about how common rape was that year.

>You cant get all emotional about facts

What kind of monster doesn't get at all emotional about things like genocides, rapes, or other human rights abuses? You're disgusting."

>Thats no way to study history.

Condemning rape as rape doesn't prevent you from studying history. Understanding that his contemporaries didn't condemn his rape as rape doesn't prevent us from condemning it. I know this amount of mental flexibility doesn't come easily to historians but at the end of the day you're just minimizing, excusing, and apologizing for slave rape.

>Because YES morals actually are not universal.

Not all are but some are. That's the entire premise of human rights. They don't go away because of the morals or culture of the times. Neither does the definition of rape depend on the time period."

Alot of people doing a thing don't make it moral, ethical, *or not fucking rape*."

Dumb fucking historians probably think Achilles and Patroclus were ""cousins""."
