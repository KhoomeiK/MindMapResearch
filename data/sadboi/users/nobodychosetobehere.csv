writing,fof0wpg,t3_g736xj,1587721930.0,"Your answer is tangled in the context of how we consume narratives.

Any good story has continuation built in from scene to scene. I think those moments are where you could find an active answer to that question in your own writing.

In my opinion, great sequels stay true to something, usually multiple something's (in varying degrees), from the original. Something like Star Wars is a good example, even if you don't like the franchise or those specific sequels.

Other good questions to ask yourself:


What sequel transitions, if any, do you like or dislike and why?

Is there a natural continuation?

What about semi parallel timelines in the same story universal?

I'm sure you and other can think of more, but I digress. Basically, understand the meta-game of writing sequels separately from the natural endings and transitions in story telling and I think you'll find your answer."

mentalhealth,fj6szdn,t3_fbu9nz,1583079507.0,There should be a licensed mental health professional that teaches a mental health class similar to the way we have PE teachers and health class teachers.

mentalhealth,fiwdxru,t3_fa2b3s,1582782485.0,"You're feeling and reactions seem pretty common among other people too. Protip: compare yourself only to your past self. This is a mentality you can practice and use to grow. Comparing yourself to others can make you anxious or feel many of the feeling you talked about in your post. I try to think of the human mind/brain like a system of muscles for lifting and moving and such, only it deals with your feelings/spirit/thoughts/emotions. It needs exercise, but properly done exercise. Just like in weight lifting, you can try and lift too much or lift suboptimally and get injuries."

mentalhealth,filzy2z,t3_f89un5,1582514494.0,Your anxiety attacks and the feelings that come with it and the feelings of those around you thinking you are over reacting are all valid and that's where you're problem might lie in my opinion. Do you have access to a therapist? I would use one or a close friend or friends to brainstorm strategies to deal with those types of situations. My suggestion would be identifying triggers and then trying to reframe those triggers as alarms it reminders (like on a smartphone but in your brain instead) to use healthy and functional coping mechanisms.
