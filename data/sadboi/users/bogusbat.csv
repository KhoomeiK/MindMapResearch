depression,fqbp6hl,t3_ghwadx,1589241242.0,I havenâ€™t moved from my bed in days nor have a eaten food. I understand how you feel. Years worth of work on my mentality to be able to stand strong only for a month of quarantine to destroy all my efforts. I know how you feel. Pm if you need.

FuckYouKaren,ff4xv8m,t3_erej8w,1579575068.0,I ruined Karens ENTIRE MOVIE experience because we ran out of peanut M&Mâ€™s at Regal... Iâ€™m glad her movie was ruined because we didnâ€™t have peanut M$Mâ€™s. The bitterness was unreal
mildlyinfuriating,fe06v3x,t3_eneebc,1578804588.0,I work at a movie theater can confirm this shit is normal. Someone comes in like every week and leaves tuna cans on the seats D:
YouShouldKnow,fabn8n5,t3_e8c8b1,1575925790.0,"Thank you for saying this! Iâ€™m constantly being asked if i have an eating disorder and it is annoying as hell and rude af especially if you donâ€™t know the person. Iâ€™m not super skinny just small but constantly being asked about my body weight makes me incredibly self conscious and as an adult has made it harder for me to accept my body. 
Iâ€™m glad to know Iâ€™m not the only one who has struggled with this issue."

piercing,f1adkvn,t3_d8glry,1569291189.0,"When I got a bump on my nose piercing I used tea tree oil to get rid of it and have been using it since. 
The trick is to not use it so often because it will dry your skin out. I used mine a couple days a week and it went away."

askwomenadvice,exmqebm,t1_exmpm4t,1566437541.0,True. But people can change. Itâ€™s been a long time since this happened and I highly doubt he will do it again. Weâ€™re happy together but if Iâ€™m not happy with myself is it better to just cut ties?
unpopularopinion,et4z2tu,t3_c9tr2n,1562460563.0,Central Cali is not a desirable place to live. The drug abuse is rampant and some places in Cali have the lowest educated areas of the US. Many assume California is an amazing state until you realize itâ€™s overrun with homeless ;( its very sad to see more and more come into town every year..
