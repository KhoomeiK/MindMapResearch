The road noise isn't bad to me, only the sound from the engine itself. That sounds in the video link I posted is exactly what I hear."
kia,fp2ld1z,t1_fp2h8yb,1588263738.0,"Oo thanks for sharing your experience! I used to have a 2014 Forte and I loved it but need to cart around a child now so went with a crossover. 

Good to know that the sound isn't unusual, just annoying."
kia,fp0redk,t1_fp0q9w2,1588215248.0,"Hi! 

Thank you for taking the time to listen to the video. I also have the 2.4L GDI engine and as worrisome as the sound is, it's nice to know that it's not out of the norm. 

Phew! I'll chill out now. 

When the noise got worse, was there anything you did that helped dampen the noise or just ignore it?"
kia,fp0oac2,t3_gamx10,1588213344.0,"Found a video someone posted with the same sound but I'm unsure if that's normal. The guy traded it in for a new car and was never able to get it fixed.

From my experience, people either just mind their own business or randomly team with me. 

Chat though, filled with complainers. I usually just ignore it unless it's party or guild chat even if nobody else ever talks."

My ex and I divorced and my son still thinks the world of his dad (he's young) and I let him but I worry about the future when he realizes that his dad only talks to him if I make him."
