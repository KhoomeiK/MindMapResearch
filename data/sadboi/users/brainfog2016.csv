It simply shows exponential growth of the infection and does not show the death rate which is what we should be concerned with.Currently Australia's death rate is 7 out of 791 infected which equates to 0.885%. The other factor to consider is the amount of people who have the virus but are asymptomatic and have not been tested. This will again make the death rate much lower.

As the world health authority suggest, the virus will have a mild effect on the majority of people, hence there will be no requirement for hospitalisation. In saying that however, the government should be allocating as much money and resources as possible to acquiring the necessary equipment and staff to manage the cases that do require hospitalisation.

Japan, South Korea and Singapore still have their borders open to most countries. These are the **countries that implemented early testing.** What is happening now with the closure of borders and reactionary measures of shutting down public venues in Australia and many other western countries are a response to the inaction that occurred at the beginning of the year. 

Essentially we will be paying the price for the inaction and ineptitude of the government. Thousands of people will lose their jobs, many will lose their homes and many will commit suicide, in which the figures will most likely not be published. The effect of the virus pails in comparison to the destruction that these ill informed policies will create.

None of the accusers went to the police and they only filed civil suits rather than criminal charges, which makes it very evident that money was the motive. The simple fact is that people do not like freaks, they do not like people who do not adhere to social norms. Jackson was certainly one of those people and will forever be vilified for it.

Pedophilia is an interesting phenomena. Some people perceive it as a form of sexuality, however the way in which pedophiles engage with children is predatory and never consensual, hence making it more of a compulsion rather than a sexuality. I think most of them view children as objects rather than people and this is what makes it easy for them to do what they do. They don't think about the pain they are causing, just the gratification, similar to eating a nice meal. If you are a carnivore you don't think about the cow that was slaughtered to make that beautiful steak, you only think about the gratification resulting in eating that steak.
It is a similar concept in being a parent - you do not think about the suffering your child will incur throughout their life and especially at the end, you only think about how cute the kid is and how you want to mold them to adhere to your own desires.

The whole idea of god is absurd - completely illogical.  When we die it will be the same as before we were born - in the beautiful void of non existence. It is crazy what we humans do to one another and because the majority of people keep themselves busy with menial work they never have the time to reflect on just how silly it all is."

I am guessing that you are not living with them, but are living on your college campus, which hopefully provides you with some relief from that nonsense. I have never come across anyone who doesn't have some level of dysfunction in their family unfortunately. The Alpha male mentality is something that is continuously perpetuated to the detriment of society and those responsible are often too stupid to realise it. Thank you for your positive words. I consider myself a Nihilist and find Nitzche to be appealing, along with Schopenhauer. I agree that academic staff can be so full of themselves ""Snobbery is the pride of those who are not sure of their position."" In other words, those who are elitists tend to be the most insecure. I think you are right about literary fiction - it seems more like an exercise in conformity rather than artistic expression. It sounds like you have your shit together, not sure how much Psych will help you in terms of character development, however the more you understand about human behaviour can only be beneficial. I wish you luck with the counseling vocation and your writing. Counseling is often more pragmatic than Psychology and I hope you get some enjoyment from it."
antinatalism,f61rqz6,t1_f605iwp,1572645372.0,"To answer your question, yes I think that people with Autism/Asperger's can have varied interests, there is no particular critieria for the amount of interests one can have, the difference between people with Autism and Neurotypicals is that people with Autism seem to be more passionate and intense with their interests. There is a certain level of hyperfocus that often comes at the expense of socialising. 

The reason I am passionate about education is because I have always disliked school from a very young age. Apparently I told my mother that it was just like a job - you start at 9 and finish at 3 that's it. There was nothing exciting or interesting about it for me. I believe that could have been very different, had I been exposed to a steiner school format which is effectively self directed learning. It is sad that the system is headed in the direction of Singapore where kids spend much of their day studying for exams. There are so many tests now, which are designed to benefit the school not the student. I am not great at Math either, except when I had a good teacher I was actually able to achieve A's, however by the time I got to year 10 I was on the verge of failing - I had the same teacher 2 years in a row and he was not a math teacher. Here in Australia only 1 in 4 math teachers are qualified in maths.  I have had a similar experience, when I was your age I was interested in Science - it was the only subject I did well at when I was in school without having to try. I started doing a vocational course and soon left, as I discovered that working as a lab assistant would provide a similar level of income to what I was receiving at the time working as a admin assistant. I also had a strong interest in Psychology, completed a Psychology degree and actually started a Social Work Master's four years ago, but once I started my clinical rotation I realised it was not for me - I am not good with people at all and did not enjoy it. I have had many jobs over the last 18 years (I am 39) and I have found it very difficult to find my niche. Working in female dominated professions is not enjoyable for me, because I am a female I am expected to behave a certain way, but I cannot and do not fit in. At the moment I am not reading much of anything, however I plan on changing that. There is a wonderful resource called the digital library that provides access to academic literature for free. I am also into sc-fi, but mainly read non-fiction. I used to love fiction when I was a kid: Enid Blyton, etc, but by the time I got to high school it was all non-fiction. I am commencing a Philosophy degree this month, looking forward to that, however it is difficult to get work in the field. Currently I am not working and have been finding it difficult the last couple of years. I have started to submit my writing to various magazines, but no luck as yet. What do you plan to do with your degree? You mentioned counselling, did you want to do that as a career or on a voluntary basis?"

I only have a few friends also and have been in a long term relationship for many years. There are so many superficial relationships/aquaintances I know what you mean regarding having a deep relationship, hence the reason I only have a few. I am not a fan of star wars, but love star trek, ( sorry if there is any offence) but I understand the passion towards certain subjects. I know that you are very passionate about the environment which is admirable. You are much younger than me, but you are wise and understand the predicament in which you face. I am passionate about education, as I feel that this is the foundational basis on which our society operates. Finland used to be no 1 in education due to their compassionate and creative additives, however Singapore, along with other Asian countries have surpassed them because many children study over 12 hrs a day. I agree it is sad. I am set to see a country that has it right on education."
antinatalism,f5yc7mq,t1_f5wby4o,1572553966.0,"Apologies for the confusion... there are few things I should clarify.
I actually meant to say interest only loans, however interest free loans can be just as problematic. What is common here is retailers offering interest free loans on furniture for a period of time usually 12 months to 2 years then charge a fortune in interest for the residual amount if it has not been paid in time. 

The comment I made regarding porn was actually facetious. While I don't particularly like it, it doesn't mean other people shouldn't.  I was providing an example of how the government is slowly eroding our freedom by enforcing new rules and reducing privacy, suggesting that people should provide their ID when entering a porn site to prove their age is absurd. I was not suggesting a connection between homelessness and porn, again i was being facetious  :-).

In terms of prevalence of diagnoses I tend to agree, despite the fact I have actually been diagnosed with Autism, I think that these disorders, while legitimate are over diagnosed. I also agree about the comment people will enjoy having their freedoms removed.

Look at what is happening with education in Asia:
https://www.theage.com.au/world/asia/chinese-province-says-no-to-homework-for-young-students-after-9pm-20191031-p536at.html

Perhaps they can pray for rain! I remember when I was studying my accounting qualification back in the mid 2000's  one of the lecturers was talking about interest only loans and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Why on earth would anyone want an interest free loan?, I thought to myself and here we are. Our government has used house prices to entice foreign investment and prop up the GDP. This greed has completely destroyed the economy. There are so many properties in metropolitan areas that are vacant and many people that are homeless. It's a pretty simple equation, yet no one in government seems to be able to figure it out. Our economy has relied heavily on resources and mining for the last few decades and now that demand for minerals and construction has decreased we are experiencing a severe economic downturn. Instead of investing in new sectors such as renewables and the scientific sector, the government simply sit on their hands and attempt to distract constituents by proposing crazy policies such as forcing people to provide their driver's license when watching porn to prove their age. As we all know porn is what has caused the economy to collapse, the education sector to decline and the rise in homelessness - The level of incompetence is truly dumbfounding. The world will burn around us but at least we have made it more shameful for people to derive pleasure from their miserable lives. Personally I hate porn, however the fact that our freedoms are slowly being eroded should be of concern to the masses, however many don't seem to care."

It's never wise to read Youtube comments. The chances of reading anything insightful are the same as finding a pink elephant on the moon. I agree with you regarding the attitude of many older folk who imply the younger generations are lazy. When you consider the cost of housing has increased tenfold and wage growth is stagnant, along with the fact that many jobs available for young people are mostly casualised or contract based, is it any wonder why many are depressed. Life is easy when you can walk into a job without having to go to college and being able to buy a house for $50,000 instead of $700,000. The thing with people is that we mostly perceive things from our own perspective, hence making it difficult to empathize with those different from ourselves leading to all sorts of poor decisions such as the election of inadequate leaders and choosing to have families knowing full well that your children's lives will not be better than your own. I am thankful I will not be around once food scarcity is an issue and neither will my hypothetical children."
antinatalism,f5sb26r,t1_f5s1wvu,1572420351.0,"I actually think the majority of people are moderates, at least here in Australia. There isn't the same level of divisiveness that you see in the U.S, however in the past five years it seems that divisiveness is beginning to emerge. There is a lot more hostility towards immigrants and inequality is growing rapidly. Many deem our conservative government to be completely incompetent who only pander to the wealthy and superficially religious, similar to the republicans over there. Many people believe that the reason the liberals won this year was because of retirees wanting to maintain the current tax structure - which may be true, however I personally think it has more to do with corporate influence and xenophobia. I do not consider Australia to be a racist country, however poor policy and lack of education has resulted in a hotbed of misinformation and anger, with many misplacing that anger towards immigrants, particularly Muslims as they are the most conspicuous. We need reduce our immigration intake because of the lack of infrastructure and job opportunities, which is due to poor policy and corporate greed, however instead of blaming the government, many direct the blame to the immigrants themselves and people like myself who were born here but look ethnic.

Politics is a nasty business indeed, it seems that it is only used as an exercise in how to manipulate as many people as possible, instead of it's intended purpose. Although many people understand this, nobody is willing to stand up and make the necessary structural changes. It made me smile to see the school kids take an afternoon from school to protest climate change policy. Many politicians berated them for their actions telling them they should be in school, however I think it is fair to say the majority of people supported them, despite the logistical inconvenience in getting to and from work that the protests caused. We also had a week of protests recently regarding climate change, there are some very passionate people here, which is wonderful to see, however I don't think it is enough to influence the assholes in power. Scott Morrison (our PM) is a religious zealot and the first thing he did after winning the election this year was to go to church and sing like an idiot - he is constantly flaunting his religiosity as if it is something to be proud of. What he fails to understand is that a third of the country identify as having no religion and religiosity is declining rapidly with each generation. Slowly these dinosaurs will fade out, however by then the damage will have already been done. I have a great deal of sympathy for young people in their teens who will inherit this shithole."

Everyone knows that Trump is an abhorrent human being (I am being generous with the term ""human being"") and I am genuinely surprised that someone has not tried to assassinate him yet. He is doing so much damage to U.S trade and while the national figures indicate that unemployment is low at present, it does not provide the depressing detail in which many people have to work two or three jobs in order to obtain a median wage. While the figures may look good on a superficial level, drill down further and you will find a lot unhappy, desperate people."
antinatalism,f5oh01f,t1_f5o6va7,1572317903.0,"Thorium is safer to mine than uranium as well and it is apparently a more efficient process. You hear people such as Warren Buffet say that his staff are taxed more than he is, and people just laugh it off as if it is one big joke. While there is some nobility in admitting such things, it also is an indictment on such individuals in that they know what the issues are, but still hire the same expensive accountants which are then written off as a tax deduction and the cycle continues. 

People such as Buffet could use their wealth to inject into the public education system or to start a new system entirely, however they would rather hang onto it like a participant in some sick game. I do hate being pessimistic, it feels awful, however I cannot think in any other way. Everywhere I turn I see  inequality and lack of freedom. Gradually the government is removing privacy and we will soon be subject to facial scans like China. We think we are free because we live in a democracy, however we are far from it. We cannot consume particular substances because they are deemed morally abhorrent.  We do not have easy access to drugs we can use to euthanise ourselves, so we must turn to more violent and less effective means because of the perceived moral issues associated with controlling one's own death. The only way in which to be truly free is to live off the grid. Grow and catch your own food and generate your own electricity and create your own water supply. It is a very appealing option."
