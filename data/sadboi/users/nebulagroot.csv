I believe your county should have a sexual assault/rape crisis center and they offer free counseling. Usually they are volunteers, but I believe some advocates have degrees in counseling.

It's so important to have the right people to talk to. People's reaction to our trauma can be more harmful to our recovery. Especially if we do not have a good support system ."

It's harsh reality because this is the world we live in. I believe we can't change people's perspective about Kobe because either they're in denial or never will believe her. I don't believe a victim needs to forgive a perpetrator. 

What happens when society forgives them and idolizes these pepetrators? Where in society do perpetrators belong one they admit guilt and ""change"" (in this case that's what Kobe fans think)? What do we in a society do if with these types of perpetrators?

Edit: I want to delete this comment, because i feel like I was victim blaming. I believe her when I read her side. In the ""best case scenario"" If consent is not clear then there is no consent, that is rape/sexual assault. 

Did Kobe change after he admitted guilt? Is it possible for a person only to commit rape once? Statistics say no, perpetrators usually have more than one victim.  should perpetrators be accepted by society if they admit guilt and  reparations are given and they show signs of change?  

I hate that the rape kit was botched because it just threw the criminal case further against her. 

I hate all this, but also we're not being supportive for victims if op is just meme-ing the situation. What are we even discussing? Because people that don't want to be reminded about the case will never believe his victim."

In my experience, whenever I was in danger I literally downplay the situation in my mind to make it seem like there's nothing wrong. For instance, one a man walked up to my friend and I and showed us a gun, he asked if I knew anyone that needed it. He opened a brown paper bag and I stopped and looked inside of it. I kept talking to him saying ""idk. I'm not sure"" and sort of laughing and saying sorry to him that I didn't know. 

I've also reacted to men's advances by letting it happen. It's hard to explain it's sort of like just letting things happen and going a long with it. There's many reasons I think about this and I'm sorry I can't tell you why people like us do this. I can say low self-esteem, childhood trauma, the need to please people, not being confident.

Your gf and I sound alike in our way to react. My rapist used the same tactics as hers. The manipulation, gaslighting, guilt tripping, threatening suicide, and fear. I wanted to help him. People like us get taken advantage of because we lack strong boundaries. 

All in all, it's hard to see from a victims perspective because we all react differently to danger. I hope you understand when I say I believe her reaction as a rape victim. The guilt, the shame we hold for something we did not cause. 


I'm so sorry you're you're through this. It's really difficult to have great support, but also you need to also support yourself.

It sounds like you're being triggered by him. I'm not sure what the right term is when this happens. Just know that it normal for this to happen. 

Weeks after I was raped I was laying in bed with my bf. We were asleep and when we woke up he started caressing me. At this point he was hugging from behind. when he spoke he sounded just like my rapist. His voice sounded just like him. My body felt like I was being electrocuted. As I layed on my side I kept thinking if I turned around it would be my rapist and not my bf.


It was months of having triggers like this. When my bfs would say ""huh"" or groan it would take me right back and the fear would overcome my body. The feelings when this happened was fear and trance like. I was like in a trance whenever he would trigger me I was ready to do anything to remember the abuse. For instance if I was triggered I would go along with sex to remind me of the abuse. 

You're not alone with these feelings. I still struggle with trusting men and being afraid of being manipulated again. Its not so bad now. Are you seeing some form of counseling?"

Society paints rapist as monsters and creeps. Which deep down they are. But they are also ""normal"" people. They laugh, they smile, they still have their own lives. They're people, friends, coworkers, parents. 

For instance, my brother has hit his girlfriends and he's abusive towards women. Yet he still believed me and cried when he picked me up the night I was raped. 


I really struggle with this a lot because I'm they type of person who wants my problems resolved. I had nightmares about my rapist staring at me and in every nightmare I would hide from him. I would also dream that I wanted to hug him and ask to be friends again. It's my brains way of processing my trauma.

But we were still hurt. Just because you pity the person does not mean they did not hurt you. It just means we are more compassionate, forgiving, and we empathize more. Than others.
