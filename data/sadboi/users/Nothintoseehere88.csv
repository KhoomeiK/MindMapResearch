solotravel,f8urkw3,t1_f8ucwod,1574840768.0,"I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt regret it! All the best! No problem, feel free to PM me if you have any other questions, As for travel I will do! Currently at the airport catching a flight to Nelson (for $70 return that I booked in sept!) grabaseat.co.nz is legit!"
solotravel,f8ubvc0,t1_f8uahh8,1574824812.0,"I‚Äôd say $5k would get you comfortably set up and time before you‚Äôd need to work and $10k would be very comfortable and get you a car! Seems like a big chunk $ but I would‚Äôve spent it anyways at home on random things or car insurance in Vancouver! Lol .. I suppose it is just price of living so I figured might as well spend it over here and have some adventure and life experience and never know who you meet and how your life may change! 

I felt really stagnant at home and was itching for a challenge and adventure .. I honestly thought I was going to lose it if I didn‚Äôt do something that made me feel like I was living!"
solotravel,f8trvnh,t1_f8tnzg6,1574809906.0,"Good on you! Winter is much milder here up north but the houses typically do not have heat and if they do, often single pane windows so it can be chilly.. one of my first winter purchases was a hot water bottle! It‚Äôs worth it though!"
solotravel,f8tglkv,t1_f8tgbzu,1574802958.0,"Yes! I have a few tips, i replied just above ‚òùüèº‚ò∫Ô∏è"
solotravel,f8tgang,t1_f8tfo2v,1574802773.0,Thank you so much for the ideas!!!! I will check them out for sure.
solotravel,f8tbowz,t1_f8szjha,1574800030.0,"Wellington is so cool! I also loved loved loved wanaka and queenstown but i worry work options would be limited. Ah yes fair enough, there are certain parts of Auckland that I love, Kingsland is probably my favourite so far. Rent is pricey but comparable to Vancouver I‚Äôd say (maybe slightly higher in areas - but I have found so many more options available for home share etc) - check out trademe.co.nz to get a feel for prices of housing and cars vs Craigslist as it‚Äôs not utilized here as much as Canada/USA. 

You can open a bank account online before you get here if you need and then confirm it when you land.  You can get a visa debit card through them and still use credit card from home but I couldn‚Äôt pay my CAD credit card with my nz account so I transferred via XE money - it‚Äôs an app and the transfer free was $0 - if I were to send via the bank it‚Äôs about $15 a transfer and takes 3 days. XE it‚Äôs in my account within about 24 hours, sometimes less! 

I rented cars for a bit and used transit at first which was fine, it really gave me a lay of the land actually so I‚Äôm glad I did that. 

And hear me out... but Kmart is amazing here!! Dishes, basic home furnishings, towels etc. It‚Äôs been so great for affordable basics to help me make new spaces feel cozy. 

It‚Äôs overwhelming to think of allll the things to do, I focused a month at a time, ie a place to live and a car rental for the month, then got signed up with some temp agencies, then honestly before I knew it everything was falling together! It‚Äôs overall been less daunting than I expected but I did have some blue days where I was sadder than I anticipated.. keeping busy and sight seeing on low days helped it to pass quick. 

All the best to you!!"
solotravel,f8t9r4d,t1_f8sz2hi,1574798858.0,"That is so awesome, thank you! I will check that out. I have a bay or plenty visit planned in December with family coming to visit.. looking forward to it!"
solotravel,f8sy28n,t1_f8su6oa,1574791620.0,"So true, my direct flight to Auckland was $602 .. I‚Äôve seen Vancouver to Toronto often more pricey than that ..!"
solotravel,f8sxw1c,t1_f8sh70y,1574791513.0,"Awesome! If you‚Äôre looking for temp work, sign up with a few agencies (Madison, Hudson and tribe are great) and for travel around the country.. book your flights a few months out as it‚Äôs so much more affordable.. I‚Äôve flown to Nelson for $49 each way but if I booked 3 weeks out it couldve been $250 each way! Also grabaseat.co.nz can have some great deals for flights! I rented a car for a bit before i bought - EzU car rental and great rentals was the cheapest. Pub quiz nights are busy and good way to meet people! But overall everyone‚Äôs quite friendly and chatty. All the best and Good on you!!"
solotravel,f8sxfiy,t1_f8sdshc,1574791230.0,"My background is in insurance but I‚Äôve just been doing project support through a temp agency, I secured work quickly and the company I was first placed with has continually extended my contract so it‚Äôs been great! I‚Äôm based in Auckland as I had fam friends to stay with and made it home base. South Island is so gorgeous i would love to live there but it‚Äôs Auckland for now as that‚Äôs where the work is for me."
solotravel,f8sx307,t1_f8sau6x,1574791015.0,"Hi! I did it myself, there‚Äôs so much information Online and I found the govt really helpful if I had questions. There are so many travellers that they have it quite streamlined in my experience. I found finding friends in my age range and a little older really easy, at home a lot of my friends had kids young and got married and I was working and travelling and felt like the odd one out at times, here I‚Äôve found people that embrace travel and settle down a bit later. Also the culture in general is really laid back and easy going - I‚Äôve found kiwis really welcoming to visitors and so happy to show you around their gorgeous country - plus often willing to come along for a weekend trip to Sydney or Melbourne!"

AskReddit,erlxbwh,t3_c2k8jh,1560999451.0,"In the fifth grade we had a contest of who could go the longest by getting 100% on our weekly spelling tests. A few months in it was between me and this one other girl. The prize was a STEREO system that was on display in class. We went a couple months and we were still in... finally she got one wrong. The teacher said she had come so far he would give her a pass. Next week... I spell delicious incorrectly. Do I get a pass? NO. Adriana walked out that day with the Damn stereo.

The teacher was banging her mom.

I‚Äôm still mad..but I‚Äôve never spelled delicious wrong again."
