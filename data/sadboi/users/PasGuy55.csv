On my own account I find that SBBM has improved, I seem to be more evenly matched when part of the final 2, and usually only lose when I do something stupid.  On my kids’ accounts, who are vastly better, I play against harder opponents. That throws away the idea someone said that it’s IP based, I don’t see that. Besides, I can shut down my router for a bit and get a new IP from my ISP. The only time I face painfully tough players is when I end up against a default who is clearly smurfing. But yes, you are correct, though PC players will cry aim assist, that’s nonsense. I have a gaming PC with a separate account, it’s way easier, aim assist not withstanding.
