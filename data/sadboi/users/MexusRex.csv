Typically people that are from or have even been to Mexico know better than this.  Mexico is an extremely internally racist society on even a casual level between the complex ethnicities that sprung from the mix of indigenous Mexicans, Spaniards, and the African slaves that were brought over.  The only difference is people foreign to Mexico do not know about it.

Also - Do you really think Spaniards did not kill indigenous peoples on Mexico?  Do you really think Spaniards and Mexica look similar?  I ask because those are the two differences you cited and they are just so stupid and ignorant.

Here is the real answer:  Mestizaje is an important cultural concept in Mexico.  That‚Äôs just how it has worked in Mexico for the last five centuries.  The shrine of La Virgin De Guadalupe was built on top of the temple of Tonantzin - and she is much more venerated to Mexicans.

Well come to find out he was a college dropout.  He blew off all his classes and failed out of college.  Then at **your** age he decided to go back and actually try.  He got so used to trying that after he graduated he kept going and became an MD, and he still tried so hard he was really successful at it.
