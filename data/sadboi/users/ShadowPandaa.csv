depression,f5x55wx,t3_dpl4bu,1572535555.0,"This is probably the post I've related to the most ever. I live my life, and I hate every moment of it, but I just keep going.... lately I've been wondering, why can't I just be happy? Why does everything I do feel like I'm just doing it to meet others standards, to just do what I'm expected of without any enjoyment. I over analyze, over think, and struggle every day. Yet I keep getting up and doing it over and over and over again. I want to run away, or just die, but then I'd make other sad. I just wish there was a way to go just one day without feeling like garbage."
depression,f0u58v1,t3_d6kk3a,1568934374.0,I'll never forget the time I told my sister I was on anti depressants and she cried.... I stopped taking them and haven't taken them since. I'm miserable. Lately I've thought about trying them again and just keeping it my dirty little secret.
