metalgearsolid,fqc5v13,t3_ghynkj,1589250749.0,I know this post is about Naked Snake but do you think Solid Snake is a virgin? Idk I'm not hating or anything just kinda thinking out loud. Wasn't he in his early 20s by the time of operation intrude 313 and wasn't he a Green Berat before that? I can't quite remember all the lore but if that's the case he would've had to join at the very earliest someone can is that like 17? That's not a lot of time for a normal life I suppose it's possible idk. I know the cloning process made him unable to pass on his genes but did it do anything else like make him not have a libido or anything? Idk this post just sent me down a thought-train I'm too lazy to investigate myself.

That it could actually function in a way similar to the in-game memory chips by informing the finder of the rock about Death Stranding.

In the same way the in-game memory chips teach the player about random things like motorbikes, action figures and soundtracks etc. So in a way this might act as memory chip #00 for the person who finds it and then they go on to play the game n find the other 56.

Nirvana,fpxq1v4,t3_gg60l2,1588987271.0,"Tl;dr: has this been restrung incorrectly or is it a matter of preference or something? And if it is strung incorrectly should I restring it immediately or will it be ok to just use it as is n restring it properly next time?

Take a look at the picture showing the close up of the bridge area. Take notice of where the strings feed through the holes. I took my jagstang to the shop to get serviced n restrung n stuff and when I got it back this is how it was. Before it got serviced the strings were fed through the holes going the opposite direction away from the neck n then bent underneath that tremelo part n up to the head. Now you can see in the picture that the strings are fed through in what seems like the normal direction (straight line from tail to head) but I'm not so sure it's correct. 

Has the serviceman restrung it incorrectly or was it incorrectly strung before (strings going backwards then underneath)? From what I can tell online it does seem like it is now incorrectly strung but maybe it's just a preference thing idk. Does anyone have any knowledge/experience with this or mustang tailpieces (they're the same or similar I think)?"

I contemplated that but I figured that accurately aiming a gun irl isn't as simple as what  games-with-reticles make it seem but it's not quite as hard (guesswork) as what games-without-reticles are. It's somewhere in between like educated guesswork. When you aim a gun irl you look down the sites and that's an educated guess as to where the round is gonna go but there's quite a lot of skill and fine tuning required to get a round to go EXACTLY where you want it within that reticle. So I went with a small black dot. Just enough to see except in the dark.

I recommend the auto-reload thing too turn that off so then fights aren't just a matter of aiming and pressing R2 you have to remember to manually reload. Can't wait for REmake3!"
residentevil,fhd7kum,t1_fhd5g53,1581479060.0,"Not necessarily but the original had items that were out of view hidden and the only way you'd know it was there is deciding to press the X buton and if you did your curiosity was potentially/occasionally rewarded with ""secret"" ammo or health or something. This no HUD thing I think simulates that in a way relevant to the OTS camera style. The obvious pick ups are still obvious but if you want take the time to be curious and really observe your surrounding you can be rewarded with ""secret"" or extra ammo n stuff that's all.

I'd highly recommend the no HUD thing though. But that's if you've got a white board marker (or some non-permanent marker). Yeah it's a bit of a pain in the ass but what I'd do is with the HUD on I'd aim a gun to get the ridicle up then draw a single black dot. I chose a small black dot specifically because it will be hard to see it in dark areas and have you ever tried aiming a gun acurately in the dark its hard lol. It really made finding some stuff feel more rewarding i think. Seriously try it just for a bit you'll love too it I reckon.

And the auto-reload thing is just something a little extra but hard mode, no HUD, no auto-reload is what ill be doing for REmake3 too I'm so excited!"
residentevil,fhd0y4v,t3_f2jyu0,1581474981.0,"tl;dr - play on hard mode for ink ribbons, turn off HUD in display settings so you have to look for things yourself, turn off auto-reload in control settings to make handling firearms just a little bit more engaging.

Now this is gonna be subjective but I wanted to get this out there before REmake3 comes out. A couple things I did when I first played REmake2 at launch to increase the intensity and imersion was to start the game on hard mode because it was the only mode to require the use of ink ribbons to save and that's like a core resident evil feature. Having limited saves is tense. This was I think the first game where I became a hard-mode-first gamer and it really ramped up the intensity.

The next which is what the picture displays is to turn off the HUD. Crazy right hear me out. In the original games you didn't get on-screen icons to tell you there's an item to pick up. Most of the items you could tell 'coz they stood out against the pre-rendered backgrounds but some were hidden behind stuff (fixed camera) and the only way to find them was to search by pressing X everywhere. When I've watched some people play REmake2 I could tell they're not really ""looking for items"" they're walking around waiting for the game to tell them somethings there via a symbol. Look at the picture with the body face down. Theres no indication he has anything on him but the game tells you theres something there. Without the HUD you could easily miss that making for more intensity and insentivising searching to find things to lower stress. In the pic with the seated zombie if you look closely you can see the box of ammo behind her hand insentivising close attention to detail. Without the HUD and item symbols you have to really observe the environment to locate things or use the original method of spamming X on everything to see if it's of use (I miss the text dialogue you'd get in the original like ""just some books, nothing of interest""). Massively increased immersion I think. The only problem is that it also gets rid of the aiming riticle so I just used a whiteboard marker on my tv to draw a simple dot in the center.

The last one is turn off ""auto-reload"". This means that when a firearm runs out of ammo in its magazine or cylinder (for revolvers) simply pressing the fire button again wont initiate a reload. When turned off there's a separate button to reload SQUARE I'm pretty sure. This helps create yet more tension 'coz you have to ""count rounds"" and know mag capacities n stuff to know when to reload. And if you get overrun and panic and start hearing clickclickclick (empty mag sounds (dry firing)) and have to remember to manually reload. Man it's tense it was awesome.

I highly recommend these options for getting the most out of REmake2 and for REmake3 in a couple months. The game will make a way better first impression this way.

Sekiro,fh9xzlm,t1_fh9pw3l,1581392246.0,Haha yeah you're not wrong. There was like 20 pics I had to narrow it down to 6. I guess I tend to do these things a lot in games like right now I'm playing RE2 Remake just mucking around with zombies trying to take funny/cool screenshots.
Sekiro,fh9pnic,t1_fh9o26w,1581386773.0,"It's what I enjoy nothing more. You're free to dislike it and criticize it but no one has to justify what it is they like to do, not even you. I like it because I like it and you like things because you like them and if someone were to try to take that away I'd be right there by your side to defend to the death your right to like something.

With that being said your criticism is welcome.

Good day sir."
Sekiro,fh9nvr9,t1_fh9nar9,1581385617.0,I enjoy both playing the game and playing dress up.
RDR2,fgv49yq,t1_fgv441k,1581136714.0,Alright no worries thanks for answering quick cheers
RDR2,fgut2nx,t1_fgusgsz,1581128792.0,Lol nah it was a quick inspection of the body to try to find out how he died (I suspect he fell n broke his neck when I lasso'd him the 2nd time) then I skinned his wolves n checked out his cave that was just there. I left his body in his cave with his naked wolves rip feral man lol.
RDR2,fgup0tr,t3_f0km7t,1581126108.0,The vid stops before you see too much but yeah. Does he respawn or can you have more than 1 encounter with him? I only saw him this 1 time.
DarkSoulsIRL,fggfl5h,t1_fgfc1h4,1580760836.0,"Holy shit this is the first time I'm hearing back about someone finding a rock I placed that's awesome! I've still never found a painted rock myself but I'll be stoked when I do.

Are you a Dark Souls player? As in did you recognise it as something from Dark Souls or was it just a rock with a strange message on it?"
Sekiro,ffzb3qv,t1_ffz755a,1580370398.0,"Idk I feel it had to be one of the ""katana"" type weapons because it's an eastern type of blade matching Sekiro's setting so any of the curved swords or straight or greatswords wouldn't fit. So I chose the washing pole because its huge and Owl's sword in sekiro is a monster lol. But you could be right because I decided entirely on looks I didn't know much about any weapon arts or anything."
Sekiro,ffykrcl,t3_evxb9i,1580348773.0,"This one was pretty fun. I spent a lot of time as a spear of the church trying to only do moves the Owl uses like throwing 2 throwing knives then doing a 2H R2, running in zig zags then doing a 1H R2 (thrust), using Lloyds talismans like those things he uses to stop sekiro from using his gourd. Using pyromancy chaos bed vestiges because it kinda looks like the owl attack. I didn't win often but it was fun."
DeathStranding,ffwa4f9,t1_ffw9yun,1580291920.0,I've looked at that sub but I'm not quite sure these sort of things qualify idk
DeathStranding,ffvtbjh,t1_ffvrwfz,1580272650.0,"You just gave me an idea for another one.

👍 ""This one's for you""

(I know Reddit and emoji's don't mix but I think it's ok in this context right?)"
DeathStranding,ffvsvh0,t1_ffvi6lm,1580272285.0,"Thanks! This is the first Death Stranding one I've done, there'll be more coming. I've done ones for other games too like Dark Souls but there obviously not here there posted in their respective game subs. It's fun going around noticing places to put some. I'm glad people enjoy them."
DeathStranding,ffvegsa,t3_evfoag,1580262212.0,There was an elderly gentlemen walking towards where I left it (in the yellow circle) as I was leaving. I reckon he saw it but I'm not sure how many older people use or know what Reddit is.
Jokes,fflj45s,t3_etycdp,1580040287.0,Wasn't this a tv advertisement sometime in the 90s? I don't remember anything about a mental hospital but the rest of it yeah. Or what the ad was for. Anyone else remember this? (An Australian tv ad btw)
darksouls3,ffht39p,t3_etn493,1579952497.0,Anyone else from Australia? Got plans for Australia Day tomorrow?
GamerPals,ffgvrbb,t1_ffg1y38,1579916301.0,I haven't played ds1 in quite sometime so there'll be some re learning to do on my part so watching you struggle won't be a problem. Send me a psn message when your playing or a direct message here on Reddit or something. My time zone is AEST (UTC + 10)(MST + 17)
DarkSoulsIRL,ffg1vnb,t1_fffnpqb,1579896659.0,Be the change you want to see in the world           \\[T]/ and join me in jolly (rock painting) cooperation.
DarkSoulsIRL,ffg16vf,t1_fff5g04,1579896232.0,"I'll post this one eventually, I've already got the rock painted up just gotta find somewhere good to put it."
GamerPals,ffen1ov,t3_et6hyn,1579855261.0,"Hey, out of the games you mentioned I could only join you in souls games but they're awesome n I'm always down to play them. Psn: hankhankin"
DeathStranding,ffehjt0,t1_ffd4jtq,1579848270.0,"I've tried to use the signs in the same sort of way dark souls messages are used. For instance I put a ""great view"" sign at the timefall farm in front of the shelves of beer (timefall porter) and it got over 1000 likes. Also put a ""great view"" sign in front of mama's lab (trying to mean she's a great view lol) but it didn't get any likes. It's not quite as diverse as the ds message system but there's some fun to be had"
DarkSoulsIRL,ffegzn9,t1_ffe5stq,1579847636.0,Thanks! You gotta do what you can to keep from going hollow while waiting for Elden Ring (news). This is what helps me.
DarkSoulsIRL,ffegfma,t1_ffe00de,1579847024.0,"Oh man I don't think I'd have the time to do more than 1 a week or so, I was wondering if I should do less but I'm really glad people enjoy these I enjoy doing them n I'll keep it up for as long as I can."
DarkSoulsIRL,ffdwq50,t3_et3e6n,1579830820.0,Is once a week too often to post these?
metalgearsolid,ffdd4pf,t3_eslmat,1579818360.0,"(Well if no one else is going to say it)
 ""No that is NOT Solid Snake"""
Needafriend,ff84v39,t3_es1oyw,1579666044.0,"I like to mostly play single player games too but here's my psn: hankhankin
