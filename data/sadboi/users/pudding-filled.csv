Spanishhelp,eytjt62,t1_eytf8bm,1567438428.0,"Hi! For male friends we also say ""Bro"" like in english you can say ""amigo"" (although it is a little formal, just a little bit) it is used when you are starting a friendship mostly but there is no problem if you use ""amigo"" in the capital of Mexico: DF/ Ciudad de México (CDMX) A lot of male friends use the word ""carnal"" and variations: ""carnalillo"" (this usually is for short people or kids or someone you appreciate and you feel older, taller, etc) we don't use ""tio"" for people, only for peoples uncles. For staff and services like waiters and waitresses you can use ""señor/señora"" (some may get offended mostly ladies if they are young so use it mostly with older people) and ""señorita"" and for young males we don't really use a word, maybe ""amigo"" but sometimes they feel weird being called like that... so only  ""gracias"" or ""gracias bro"" (for example) are fine.
