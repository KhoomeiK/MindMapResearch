BPD,fo1cjfu,t3_g533kd,1587430339.0,"It's not necessarily that you're good at concealing it, it might just be a different kind of BPD. There is internal and external BPD. Internal tends to be super nice people that constantly rip on themselves. External tends to go on everyone, and then there's the ones that seem fantastic and well put together outside the home, but behind closed doors, they're a nightmare. You're not alone."
BPD,fo17b5x,t1_flk5nkt,1587427216.0,"I can ONLY cry for movies. That's it. I cry when people die, and when there are happy family endings, or when parents are wholesome with their children (which is why I hate most Christmas movies). Sometimes I'll push myself to cry longer, just so I can keep crying, because it feels so nice to finally let things out, but when I start thinking about my actual problems, I stop crying. It really freaks my boyfriend out."
BPD,fo16g75,t3_fp51l3,1587426713.0,"I live across the  country from my BPD mom, and there were a couple times when she called me to tell me that one of my close relatives had died. I could tell by the way she was talking, so I'd just say ""Okay, who died?"" When she told me, I'd just be like ""Wow, that sucks."" And never shed a tear. Not because I didn't love them, or care about them, it was sad, but I just, didn't feel it. You know? I acted up a bit more for my dad, when he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, but part of me feels like that was fake. Forced, because it felt like I SHOULD be sad, and unable to do things. When things get crazy I just kinda sir back and watch. I know there's nothing I can do, so I just watch things unfold. My boyfriend's dad was going into surgery for a triple bypass, and I literally felt nothing, the whole time. I supported my boyfriend as much as I could, but I don't feel like I did a good job. I guess I don't necessarily feel oddly calm in chaotic situations, I think it's more like I just don't feel at all."

My first time through it took me forever, and by the time I finished it, I had gotten all but one trophy (knocking over those dang grazers at the beginning) without looking any of them up. I just played the game, and enjoyed every minute of it. There was a point where I realized the game was coming to an end, so I went and found all the collectables, and found all the other side missions along the way. Even when I finished everything I could, I still didn't want it to end. It's an amazing game."
