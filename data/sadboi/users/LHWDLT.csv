SO anxious, had an allergic reaction to Abilify, and now I‚Äôm risperidone and I LOVE it. If you have a problem with fatigue from meds this is amazing. I take it with tons of b12 and it‚Äôs a miracle drug. It doubles as an antidepressant which is v helpful."

Also, did you have insane breast pain?"

I did gain about 10-15 lbs and had a significant amount of breast growth (I‚Äôm a female, but happen to males too.) and a bit of lactation. But I love it so far. Huge fan.

BipolarReddit,fiatlb9,t3_f7cncu,1582308133.0,"I relate to this so much. Now that I'm medicated I am so anxious all the time and lost my sense of self worth and lack of caring what others thought. I have to constantly give myself pep talks and talk to myself like that part of my brain would function when I was unmedicated. Finding a few key parts of yourself that you are really proud of helps too. I had to reform my identity and beliefs (because of that saying things you don't necessarily agree with when manic) when I was unmedicated, and it definitely helped."

mentalhealth,fhjkkz8,t3_f3kffn,1581648512.0,You‚Äôre not wasting your time. You can begin your life ambitions when you‚Äôre 25 or 50. The only thing dictating that we should move out when we‚Äôre 18 and be starting our life and career after that is capitalism and society. You owe no one anything. It seems like you‚Äôve been through a lot too- you have every right to live your life exactly how you‚Äôd like when you‚Äôd like (as long as you‚Äôre not hurting yourself or anyone in the process.)

I just need to make it until this semester is over."
