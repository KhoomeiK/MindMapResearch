I don‚Äôt know what worse. The great depression made 7 million people starve to death but I doubt the numbers will be that high after this pandemic since automation has advanced so much since the 30s but nonetheless we are going to be suffering for years.

unpopularopinion,fjzfidc,t1_fjz2bjs,1583718516.0,That‚Äôs a vast generalisation to make
AmItheAsshole,fjzeiec,t3_ffivtc,1583717846.0,YTA even though fake jellyfish probably won‚Äôt help with anxiety... who cares??? How would that even make anyone uncomfortable?? I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a big deal but you are making it one. Just let her have her damn fish if it makes her feel better.
BPD,fjze2io,t3_ffiiy9,1583717556.0,I feel the same way. I have this feeling that I will never be a normal functioning member of society. I want to have hope but it‚Äôs really hard.
Shitstatistssay,fjz13zn,t1_fjytm4l,1583708980.0,"Because the Catholic Church has picked and chooses what gospels they want in the bible to fit their views. That was before the bible was translated. After it was translated and the protestant reformation happened, there was no going back to what the bible could‚Äôve been before the Catholic Church decided to censor out many parts and completely leave out some."
BPD,fjyze6g,t3_ffd320,1583707879.0,"I‚Äôm a quiet bpd too, I always fantasise about confronting people but in really life i freeze in those situationüò´üò´ its so fustrating"
BPD,fjy8seg,t3_ff6ud7,1583692060.0,"It‚Äôs very hard to not care what others think and most people who say they don‚Äôt care are lying to
themselves. It‚Äôs human nature to want to have approval from others. Most ppl start shit because they are bored and want to get a reaction out of someone or they just want to feel better about themselves. Try not to reward her bad behaviour by reacting. It seems to only cause more problems and being calm about it will show her that you are more mature and won‚Äôt stoop to her level."
unpopularopinion,fjww2ed,t1_fjwtaxf,1583647406.0,I think I should‚Äôve rewritten this to include average ppl too. It was a good example because of how much everyone had a field day with her story but the stigma that addiction has affects everyone. People tend to be unempathetic when it comes to addicts in general because they can only see things from their perspective and they are fortunate enough to not have been personally affected by it. Life‚Äôs not so simple.
unpopularopinion,fjwtzct,t1_fjwtnv8,1583645820.0,Yeah I agree with that general statement. Being famous is not easy and people should only pursue that fame if they are ready for the shit that comes w it
unpopularopinion,fjwtf5r,t1_fjwsr2f,1583645396.0,I‚Äôm hope the best for you and your recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è stay strong
unpopularopinion,fjwtap3,t1_fjwt294,1583645302.0,I 100% agree. You truly don‚Äôt know that struggle of being mentally unwell until you are neck deep in it and going closer and closer to rock bottom everyday.
