Thanks for your email. I can assure you that mofono is not a scam!

We are currently overhauling the look of our website, but rest assured the ability to cash in at any UK Post Office is still very much in place.

Mofono was only launched in the UK a few weeks ago and already 100s of people have cashed in at a Post Office already. 

So if you want your ‘beer credit’ topping up download mofono!

then this one happened

keep this in mind the reply below happened when I said I sending these replies to Reddit to try and help people understand them.

 

Thanks for your email. The texts purely terminate on our servers - we have an interconnect agreement with mobile networks where each sms that lands derives a revenue, which we are able to share with you. The service is entirely free to use as far you’re concerned, however. 

If you could do me a favour, Suzi. We are aware that you have left some defamatory comments about mofono on Reddit. It would be hugely appreciated if you could remove these forthwith!

Thanking you in advance.

Best wishes

Tim Nichols   


I did correct him and advised him to get social media people and I got this reply

If there’s been a misunderstanding then I apologise. It can be frustrating and extremely damaging when people criticise without any evidence. 

If you haven't already signed up then let me know if you do and I’ll add a £5 credit to your account immediately.

Hope this clears things up.

Regards
