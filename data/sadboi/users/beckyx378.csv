I'm not sure what youre getting at here. 

>Did he call you from his own phone, or from an unfamiliar/withheld number? And did he say which police station he had been taken to?

Yes, it was a private number, not his own. 
And yes, he told me what police station it was.

We all know some officers think they're a lot higher in the world then they actually are. 
So who knows what they feel like doing, to ruin someone's night."

I hope you find a way of coping and it helps you on your journey through this! ðŸ¤ž"
AmItheAsshole,fgqb6t1,t3_ezqkge,1581021115.0,"NTA. 

Why are we still letting people like this act like they do?

If he took a little more time in actually listening to you both,instead of trying to just get the sale, he may have had better luck. 


Good on you for going back the next day, and giving someone deserving the commission!"
Anxiety,fftf12n,t3_euub8p,1580218662.0,"Congratulations! 

I have this same anxiety when it comes to calls. I have probably taken/ made 5 calls in the last 2 or 3 years! 

I know to a lot of people, it's something they do everyday, and don't second guess anything. 

My anxiety comes with the accents mostly. If I think I won't be able to understand what they're saying, it's make me panic. Even though I have absolutely no idea who I'm about to speak to! 

We all get these little nibbles, and just be proud of yourself for taking charge and doing it! 

I hope I can do take this as a push, and answer calls more often!"
Anxiety,fdjofdy,t1_fdio8fe,1578480808.0,"I am very open with him that it scares me to meet new people, no matter who they are. He understands, but I do think it's starting to take a toll on him that it has been so long. 
He supports me, and never complains. But this time, I want to do it and simply 'get it over with'. 

His friends make him so happy, and seem like lovely people. I know I have to go this time and I have almost 3 weeks to get my anxiety under control! ðŸ¤ž"
