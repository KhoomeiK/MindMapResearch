bipolar2,fmjrhu8,t1_fmjko1i,1586136220.0,how is hypo for you?
bipolar2,fmgibea,t1_fmgecik,1586049710.0,you're not alone. hang in there 💕
BipolarReddit,fmd42gx,t3_fuew4o,1585958869.0,"totally relate. when i'm hypo and feeling good about life, i also find myself more attractive. and i take joy in looking good, so i make efforts to look better and better, and enjoy the attention and everything. i'm not a fan of makeup, but when i'm feeling good i wear it and think i look quite nice. i also watch out for my weight. i just feel *better* and that reflects in how i present myself to the world because during those times i feel like the way i look is very important.

but when i'm depressed... i feel like the ugliest person alive, and i wish i was being dramatic saying that. i legit avoid mirrors, cameras, many times i've cried just from getting a glimpse of my reflection. i go for days without brushing my hair, months without doing my eyebrows. i only wear flip flops, no matter the place or occasion. and i usually stay locked in my room 24/7, so i only wear pajamas. i couldn't care less about the way i look. and i'm usually super unhealthy (no sleep, junk food everyday, etc) so i do look like hell.

one thing i hear a lot from my family is ""why don't you take better care of yourself? you look so great when you do that"". easier said than done! :-( it all depends on my current mood/energy and it freaking sucks."
BreakUps,fm5u8te,t1_fm5o2vh,1585780069.0,"i agree with everything you said, my views are basically the same. i've always told them that i never mantain a friendship with an ex, and it's not always because i'm bitter or it was a bad relationship, but because - like you said - if we're done, we're done. i wanted to try and mantain a friendship this time because they're pretty great overall and we have a good friendship, but like, i'm the one who's still in love, so i'm the one who's ""hurting"" and going nuts reading between the lines and waiting for signs. but it's over for good, i need to accept that and move on, and unfortunately i can't do that while talking to them 24/7. i wish i could ;-/ thanks for listening!"
BreakUps,fm5tnu1,t1_fm5noei,1585779734.0,"yep, that's me :-( i love being their friend but i just can't ignore the fact that i'm still in love and want to be with them. and i've tried to ignore... they said they value my friendship above all else, and that it's unfortunate we can't talk 'as friends' but 'that's life', that they understand. i feel so petty and silly, but i know it just makes things harder for me. thank you for your answer!"

bipolar2,fjbrpad,t3_fbzy8t,1583199951.0,"during my last hospital stay, some of the nurses (one in particular) weren't very nice and i overheard one of them saying that ""kids today"" call themselves bipolar/depressed and try to kill themselves ""over anything"". it made me feel pretty upset. i'm the same age as you. some professionals refuse to diagnose or medicate younger people. when i started treatment back in my teens (it's been 7 years now), a lot of my behavior was shrugged off and seen as 'teen angst' and a phase. it clearly escalated over the years. 

regarding lamotrigine, i quit it recently myself. i'm willing to try an alternative for it, but i haven't been to an appointment yet. i liked it fine at first but then i started experiencing more side effects than benefits, along with the antidepressants. they make me too anxious and it sucks. maybe it's not my best decision, as i've been feeling super extra shitty. but like, enough is enough.

i think you're very brave for reaching out for help, it's not an easy thing to do. and i hope things turn out okay and you get the help you need."
bipolar2,fjblr43,t3_fcap13,1583196156.0,"i recently stopped taking lamictal because it was giving me acne. i have an almost non existent self esteem, but i've always appreciated my (mostly) good skin. acne was never a problem for me when i was a teenager or anything, and i know it sounds vain but i absolutely refuse to have to deal with this as an adult. i legit had a nervous breakdown after looking in the mirror and seeing how ugly my skin looks. i've been wanting to quit my medication for a while, so that was like the ultimate excuse i guess. i also stopped taking antidepressants because they made me anxious (i'm still on quetiapine and sleeping meds). coincidentally enough, i'm on a weird mixed episode funk. last week i went no sleep for a day and a half, even with my meds. and i actually felt better than i've felt in a long time! but of course, eventually i started crying and panicking... i went shopping and had to be stopped otherwise i would spend a lot of money on things like an unicorn cup and various erasers. i'm very pissed off, sometimes at nothing in particular. everything sets me off. today i was so angry because the sun was shining and my family was making noise and i was like wtf!! it's way too early for this!! angrily got out of bed, looked at the clock. it was 2pm. i've been changing things around in my room because why not. i decided to paint this box. halfway through it i felt so angry because it looked absolutely hideous. i'm just so angry all the time. then i feel energized. then i start questioning my whole life and crying. i have an appointment with a new doctor tomorrow, but i don't know if i'll be able to go. i hope can though, because i need some drugs to help me get through this mess. :-("

SuicideWatch,fi299lc,t3_f5yhn7,1582074433.0,"are you in treatment for your bpd? you're right, mental illnesses make everything very intense. i have bipolar, i am always going up and down; currently down, very down. one of the things that have been difficult to deal with recently is a breakup as well. it just leaves an empty, longing, aching feeling. i feel like these words don't even do it justice. it's just like daily agony, moments of numbness, then idk, more agony. 

breakups are horrible for everyone, but with mental health issues i honestly think it gets a bit darker. heartbreak is part of human life, and everyone going through it wonders ""will i ever feel okay again?"" and stuff like that. well, for me personally, it gets to the drastic proportion of ""i'll definitely not gonna be okay. i am [a saga of insults]. i am worthless. i don't deserve love"" and the obvious solution to all of that, is, big shock! suicide. my last suicide attempt was when i was going through a breakup (a pattern? 😅). i got okay, and actually had another shot at my relationship, we tried again. now it's over (again) and i'm at a complete loss. i don't want to repeat the last action that i came to deeply regret, but i guess that the fact that i'm in this sub speaks for itself. also, one thing that i particularly hate is how people say that suicide over a breakup is ""stupid"" or ""dramatic"" or whatever. i wouldn't say i would kill myself over anyone. i would kill myself because i feel so lonely and unloveable, because every time i try to give it a go, it ends badly. that's why. 

your ex sounds like a narcissist, btw. i think you're better off not talking to him, and i admire you for that. i know how fucking rough it is to stop talking to someone like that. have you seen the breakup-related subreddits? they can be helpful. 

i'm not actually a fan of xxx's music but i've been listening to ""sad!"" a lot because the lyrics reasonate with how i feel right now, i even shared it with someone else."
SuicideWatch,fi26ola,t3_f6007e,1582072720.0,"i am a bit older than you, i'm 21. high school ended when i was 17. i genuinely thought i would have killed myself before i graduated. like you mentioned, it's not even an attempt to be edgy or emo or whatever, it was just what i felt. but from being an ""overwhelmed"", ""pissed off"" and ""ungrateful"" teenager came dangerous behavior, worsening mental health, more isolation, suicide ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempt. that's when shit starts to hit the fan, so to speak. you mention your family; would you care to elaborate on that? have they offered you help?  

i lurk this sub a lot especially when i'm going through bad episodes, but i don't really have advice to offer because i haven't found my answer(s), either. my case is pretty common: won't study, won't work, good family, very few friends, lots of self hatred, soul searching comes back to square one, blah blah blah. your post reasonated with me because yesterday i wrote a note on my personal blog very similar to what you're saying. after hours of reading posts on the sw, depression, bipolar subs and such, i took a step back and realized ""wow... what the fuck is wrong with me?"" my life is ridiculously easy. my parents aren't perfect, but they try pretty hard. i have access to decent mental health care. i have people who care. i actually don't have to work, struggle with money or struggle to survive. every day i wake up in a nice, clean house, in my comfy bed. i have water, food, technology, a loving mom, the cutest dog in the world. yet, here i am. feeling like i'm being sucked into this great big black hole of, i don't know, half despair and half nothingness. in my note (and previous ones before that) i kept referring to myself as selfish and dramatic, which i believe is correct. my life is no greek tragedy or tear jerking drama. it's just a normal ""millennial"" life. and here i am.

feel free to vent more if you want. i'd like to know about your family, your friends, if you have hobbies or interests, have you ever tried to seek professional help, what keeps you going. whatever you wanna share, if that's your wish :-)"
SuicideWatch,fi0utat,t3_f5lzxx,1582045214.0,"me as well. my family knows i'm suicidal and i have attempted before, but they tell me that if i truly love them then i will stay. it's like that bob burger's meme ""well, fine, but i'll complain all the time!"""
bipolar2,fhymo2y,t3_f4x6ft,1581979111.0,"i'm in the same situation at the moment. it feels like an endless cycle for me, i have a sense of the things i do wrong and what i can improve and such, but the weight of my personality and my thoughts, i think, keep pushing me down. well, honestly, i end relationships and friendships on a whim. i isolate. i had a nervous breakdown about two weeks ago, i freaked a (also bipolar) friend out because i kept saying stuff like ""this is goodbye"", ""you're great and i love you but i can't do it"", etc. she and my ex freaked out thinking i was going to attempt suicide again, it turned into a messy situation for them trying to reach my family and texting me (phone was off). obviously i feel embarrassed about this and i recognize it was some unnecessary drama caused by yours truly. what i was meaning to say to the friend is that i can't keep the friendship with them because i'm too much of a trainwreck and i'm tired of hurting people. family is another thing, but as far as friends and partners go, i know i can choose those. and i'm stepping out because it all became too overwhelming. i know this is not exactly happy advice, but i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm struggling with this as well so you're definitely not the only one. people say that isolating ourselves is a big no, but i don't know. i hate the idea of hurting others, which i do way too often. i think it's understandable to set your own boundaries, you know? but of course we can't take it too far and get cabin fever or whatever. human beings need to socialize to some degree. these days i've been keeping it to a minimum, but lurking subreddits makes me feel less, well, alone. i've been writing these feelings and thoughts, to myself, which is one thing that helps. also music. and sleeping. i understand you might feel like a bad person (same!) but if you're taking time to recognize that you're making mistakes and that you want to improve, i think that means something."

SuicideWatch,fhvodt5,t3_f4pdml,1581899503.0,"i like both genders and anything in between tbh. when i first started noticing that i had feelings for people of my gender, i just felt fucking disgusting. so, so, so disgusted. i used to tell my best friend at the time (who is bisexual, if that counts) that it was gross, gross, gross! and i would never 'give in' to these feelings because it was just, well, wrong. some pretty homophobic shit i don't even like to think about, i was just a kid but yeah. of course that came from my background. my family is religious, conservative, not extremely but like your average family. snarky remarks have always been made and still are. so i grew up hearing that same sex relationships/interactions/desires are a no-no, it's just wrong and it's not the way god meant it (i always laugh about this because, come on). so the whole sexuality deal has always been very repressed in my life, i just always felt off, like why can't i just be straight like my siblings and make things easier in general? no actual surprise when i secretly 'gave in' to the 'wrong temptations' when i was in my early teens, i was just experimenting but that was a whole other fucking mess that just left me feeling more disgusting than i was in the beginning. i blocked that shit out of my brain and to this day i still refuse to think about it. because when i do, i just feel really gross. i don't even know how to explain this to anyone, sure it felt good, sure it was what i liked, but maybe i was a bit too young, after a while i didn't want it anymore but i kept going because i didn't know what else to do, and it messed up my head even more. it always felt and it still feels wrong. i don't know, i started seeing my whole body and my sexuality in general as disgusting, i'm not exactly sure if it's been like 9 years since this i guess, but i haven't let anyone touch me since then and i don't want to. i've had online relationships with both genders but i never told my parents about any of them up until recently. long story short, during a drunken nervous breakdown i told my mom i swing both ways and that i wish i wouldn't but i do and i recently got my heart broken by someone of the same gender as me. she was clearly disappointed, but not entirely surprised. she told me 'it's okay' (yeah sure). next day i overheard her on the phone talking to my sister and she said, ""yeah, it's not really normal, but what can we do except accept it"". so that was a punch in the gut. i honestly can't see myself introducing same sex partners (if i ever get one lol) to my family because... it's just embarrassing. i know part of society tries to make us feel better and be all 'it's not your fault, it's okay!' and well, they're technically right, but doesn't make it any easier. like you said, it feels like pitying. you can't go around parading your same-gender partner unless you're ready to get, best case scenario, some hateful looks. my therapist always said that sexuality is 'a big part' of my personal turmoil and that's probably true. it's fucking rough. you know even if you find a community and people who make you feel okay about it, knowing your family - whether you got their love or support, but that's another deal - doesn't think you're normal, and half of society doesn't think you're normal, and you just wish you were different and things were easier, it just fucking sucks. i'm not a gay man but i know it hurts. like hell. sorry for the long wall of text, it's not very often that i hear others talking about this nor do i talk about this myself. have an online hug from me if it makes you feel better."

BreakUps,fgqygoe,t1_fgqwvlm,1581034178.0,"oh yeah, sometimes i feel more conflicted by getting so much opinions and ideas so i just sort of turn everything off, shut down and lie in bed lol that's what i've been doing lately. just going with the flow i guess. after the breakup i freaked out then after a few days i apologized and tried to say the right words and blah blah blah, got more hurt - that's why most of us are pro-no contact tbh - now i'm still nutty and tormented but honestly i've reached a point where, i don't know? i just lurk this sub everyday? i'm a very emotional person so i get that whole sobbing loudy while wanting to send a huge wall of text thing going on but right now i'm sort of blah. some people are worth fighting for, some aren't. but what i ask you to keep in mind is one thing: your own wellbeing and happiness is totally worth fighting for, more than anything else"
BreakUps,fgqvo41,t1_fgqummc,1581032470.0,"yeah thats basically how it is, everyone has different opinions but usually the overall idea is the same. you're the one who knows her best though. and it's your choice. you just gotta think and then it's take it or leave it. relationships are sucky because it's a hit or miss. and we're so invested. i think eventually your heart will tell you what path to follow, but be sure to listen to your mind as well!"
BreakUps,fgqu94i,t1_fgqsk8y,1581031614.0,"oh i see! well, i think you should think about what her ""motives"" for being apart are and everything else she said, i don't really like the whole ""ohhh no don't chase just forget them"" deal because we know sometimes it doesn't work that way and sometimes we do get them back (i did too but not anymore lol) so we got that ""what if i try again"" feeling which i suppose is what you're feeling rn. i just think your best option is to really think things through (write them all down maybe, that helps me to sort things out because i think way too much) and also consider her feelings and whatever boundaries she might have set up, and do what you think is best"
BreakUps,fgqsemd,t1_fgqrxre,1581030478.0,"thats what i was trying to understand tbh it doesn't make much sense if she didn't care about their opposition but now, especially after all this time, she's saying she can't do it because of them. you guys were long distance? it's particulary tough i know that :-("
BreakUps,fgqrmxt,t1_fgqr1c6,1581030012.0,i see. but she is saying now that without their permission you guys can't do it anymore? she wants to play by their rules this time?
BreakUps,fgqqe3g,t1_fgqpaef,1581029285.0,"i see. i think it's very important to reflect on the 'unhappy' deal. sometimes they want to be with us, but they're unhappy. sometimes it could be better if we're not around, as much as it kills us. does she really care about her parents' opinion that much? if she wants to respect their wishes then she has that right, it's her decision."
BreakUps,fgqojtr,t3_ezxq0z,1581028208.0,"i'm in a similar spot, sorta. i think if she's blocked you then it makes the situation more delicate. if she unblocks you... well. i think you should lay low and think it through before making a decision. was this breakup worse than the previous one?"
SuicideWatch,fgqlg0n,t3_ezf7z1,1581026449.0,"i remember your username because it stood out. i remember i read your post and upvoted it. i spend a lot of time reading posts in here. i don't really have anything to say, i'm in pain too. i can only hope you find peace, one way or the other."
bipolar,fgq4mdr,t3_ezukty,1581017773.0,"i would say it was between the ages of 13 and 14, after i had been depressed for a while."
BreakUps,fgq405w,t3_ezqoba,1581017444.0,"yup, going through the same situation right now."
BreakUps,fgmdtm6,t3_ez5k27,1580922615.0,"i can't imagine how you must be feeling. and i know that doesn't mean much, but i truly am sorry. from your story, i can relate to three things: i struggle with disordered eating as well (it's gotten better, but i honestly don't think it will ever go away completely), i'm diagnosed with other mental illnesses and overall life is just tough, and i've also been left recently because i was neglectful, unstable, quite mean, and overall just a bloody mess and i wasn't really quite *there* anymore. it's been very difficult, it was difficult yesterday, it is difficult today. it hurts a lot. i just thought i should say, you are a strong person even if you don't think so. and i truly hope your dad gets well soon, i can't imagine how difficult and heartbreaking it must be to go through a parent's illness while going through a breakup. i hope everything turns out good for you, i really do."
SuicideWatch,fgkqsl9,t1_fgkewuz,1580871551.0,"i see. if they know about your struggle with suicidal thoughts, do you think that even if it was an apparent incident they wouldn't wonder if you might have done deliberately? or do you think they wouldn't doubt it? i think you actually make a lot of sense, not wanting to hurt your family because you love them and they love you."
SuicideWatch,fgk6p9g,t3_eyyxz0,1580858648.0,"i feel the same way. i love and care about my immediate family. they think i don't, because of the attempts, the substance abuse, etc etc. i've had the same thought you are having. 'maybe they won't know'. have you ever talked to them about your suicidal thoughts?"
bipolar,fgk3x7h,t3_eyr7bs,1580856960.0,"> One day I love everyone in my life and the next I feel so alone that I want to die. 

same over here. it's pretty difficult. i can't trust my own judgment because since it changes so much, then what the fuck do i even know anyway?? do my crazy shit, deal with the consequences, feel awful, isolate, try to hold onto the sanity i still have left. but one thing is, i try to remember myself of how awful it was being in the hospital. it doesn't help much and the 'bad thoughts' don't actually go away, but even for a couple hours it makes me think 'ah, yes. let's avoid going down that road again.'"
bipolar,fgk3fjx,t3_eyp8pn,1580856672.0,"i'm on sertraline for months now, my doctor recently increased the dosage. it gives me really bad diarrhea and i barely eat (except when i take seroquel, then i go full-on monster mode). but overall i think it's helped. the good and the bad, you know."
bipolar,fgk2ke0,t3_eyty6e,1580856169.0,"i honestly don't even know anymore. kinda pissy, but keeping it cool so far. no crying either. watching tv shows, listening to music and scrolling reddit and tumblr (the only social platforms i can tolerate right now) to make the hours pass. turned off my phone and put it away because it was making me anxious even though i deleted most apps. been in bed all day, i wanted to sleep it off but my brain eventually forced myself to get up and shower. it goes back and forth between shitloads of thoughts and then 'i'm okay' numbness. sighs. the meds help tho."
bipolar,fgk220a,t3_eywnv3,1580855875.0,"yelling can be quite therapeutic imo. just try not to scare anyone i guess! and some days, a good cry is what we need. if you enjoy running and it makes you feel less stressed, go for it, for sure."
BreakUps,fgfk0oh,t1_fgemnfl,1580740837.0,thank u and hang in there. and happy cake day!
That70sshow,fgfjy0g,t1_fgf57go,1580740781.0,same
BreakUps,fgehon1,t3_exnbfu,1580699742.0,"it was definitely a defining factor for one super scary hospital stay. not because of it, but because i was not coping with all the other shit *plus* it. doctors can be good because they look at the situation from a more neutral point of view."
BreakUps,fgefrhd,t3_exvpkh,1580698538.0,"i deleted their number and disappeared from social media. it's usually like ""\[snaps eye open at 2am\] ""must text them"" \[cries\] \[sad breakup song\]"". really sucks. i found a good tip here on this sub, actually. this computer app called ""cold turkey"". i just refuse to look at my phone because i just stare at it waiting for something. i actually removed my SIM card so no one can talk to me and i don't feel tempted to talk to them lmao i watch stuff too but what actually gets my attention the most are self help videos and reading breakup stories so it's like ""ah, well, i'm not the only one going through this crap."""
depression,fgeadc4,t3_exscf7,1580695023.0,"oh boy, breakups are one of the most difficult things in the world according to anyone ever, but when you've already been depressed/mentally unwell/suicidal. ouch... it is truly difficult for everyone, and everyone feels, everyone suffers, everyone feels like shit. it's universal. but for some people it's  like ""that's it. that's the final straw. the last punch."" speaking for myself. i got dumped recently (ha) and been drinking a lot too and trying to numb myself with pills, sleep, whatever. everyday is like silent screaming and ugly sobbing. loads of self-pity, anger, more sadness. we're in this together, i guess?"
That70sshow,fge8tpk,t1_fge0yhw,1580693984.0,"i went to bed for a few days, as kitty forman would say."
bipolar2,fge7ssn,t3_exjols,1580693314.0,"my niece too! she's so lovely. and also my parents, especially my mom."
bipolar,fg59af3,t1_fg57vaz,1580521519.0,anytime! ❤
BreakUps,fg53r1n,t1_fg4zgv8,1580517534.0,"oh i see. i think it could be good, and if you have the feeling it would be good then i would say go for it tbh but i'm not the best person to say that ... would you be okay with receiving a ""bad"" response (like maybe not necessarily mean or anything, but do you think it could hurt?)"
BreakUps,fg4lq1i,t3_ewt5y5,1580505893.0,"for me it goes back and forth between love, hate, love, hate. they were the best person in the entire world, but at the same time they bugged me. i desperately wanted to be there, but at the same time i didn't. we both made mistakes, of course, everybody thinks i'm blind about that (which bugs me!) but i'm not. i could write a list of all the things they did wrong. but i recognize it must have been exhausting, you know, being with me. as much love as i felt (feel) i would say the most vile things. they never forgave me for this one fight where i said horrible things that i've never said to anybody in my life. it's scary, it seems that along with all this love comes all this hatred. i don't know, maybe it's just my fucked up brain lol

right now i'm in the same boat as you. i hate hearing that i shouldn't want them back because hey, guess what, i do and i fucking obsess over it even if i try to stop myself from doing so. every day i think about reaching out, but i did the last time, and it makes me think, that wasn't love. maybe i don't know what love is. i still wait."
BreakUps,fg4jl2f,t3_ewp8wq,1580504587.0,"i totally understand the desire to do this because i've done it myself (more than once!) but, you know, sometimes the answer will hurt more. either i want to admit it or not, i had an expectation in my mind of how they would reply, and when they definitely did not reply in the manner i thought, it was like another kick in the face when i was already down. it's a hit or miss, you know. either you'll be 'okay, good' and move on or you'll be 'ouch, this was a dumb mistake.' whatever you decide to do, i hope it turns out okay."
BreakUps,fg07vwt,t3_ew7ym6,1580402121.0,"don't check :-( i know how hard it is, and i know most of us do it at some point, i always tell myself ""it's going to be the last time, just this one more time."" then i see they're doing fine, and well ... it hurts. a lot. so it's worse. it's much, much worse. and being completely realistic, i know i will check again some time down the line. and maybe it won't hurt as much anymore. you know what they say, 'let go.' haven't got that quite figured out yet."
bipolar,ffxeyeh,t3_evqr23,1580323779.0,"i've been in a depressive episode which was the main reason why my relationship ended about three weeks ago. i also told them i loved them and they refused to say it back so, i think i know how you feel! i've been drinking a lot (it's been a while since i cut that down, but it seems to work sometimes) and i also take ambien and trazodone to sleep (and other meds during the day but i prefer the sedatives), and it's like the only thing that makes me feel remotely okay. the reason why i'm obsessively scrolling through the bipolar/depression/breakups/suicidewatch subs is because i'm not okay either, and i don't know what to do about it either, but i hope things get better for you."
bipolar,ffxak0i,t3_evno1r,1580321182.0,"i'm on lamotrigine too, 200mg for me. these days it's cycling more than usual. you're not alone, you can talk to me if you want"
BreakUps,ffx59nw,t3_evf7fg,1580318033.0,feeling this ...
BreakUps,ffx4f2b,t3_evnjy8,1580317520.0,"i'm going through the same right now. i recognize there were mistakes from both sides but i was completely impulsive and my current depressive episode was the last straw. i feel guilt everyday, and i actually feel angry at people telling me i shouldn't feel it lol because i am guilty. not the only one, yeah, but i am. and i just don't feel good enough. and the fact that they're not coming back kinda proves that."
SuicideWatch,ffv8u06,t3_euyjkp,1580258424.0,"this... exactly. everything goes wrong and i am completely aware that it's all my fault. i'll always be fucked up. always have been, in everything i do. the idea of waking up every day and having to live in my own brain breaks my heart. i keep doing bad things and i can't stop. i wish it would all stop."
BipolarMemes,ffuel07,t3_ev7mp5,1580240320.0,lmao this is exactly me right now
bipolar2,ffue27e,t3_et2ktj,1580240008.0,"yeah. i can't remember what it was like to not think about death, to not have a suicide plan, to not attempt. it's just always there. it's scary. it's comforting."
bipolar2,ffuc2pk,t3_eur2v2,1580238827.0,"i've noticed that when i'm going through PMS the bad things become more intense, especially my anger. but at this point i'm not even sure which one is what. i am on my period right now and having a breakdown, so i hope after the period is over i feel better? lol"
bipolar2,ffubr8m,t3_ev4tf3,1580238641.0,"yeah, i feel like i  fail everything i try to do. it's just exhausting. i hear so much about how i should take care of myself and do things and work hard but idk, maybe i'm just lazy or maybe i'm a coward, but i just want to disappear."
heartbreak,ffmtczv,t3_etvf6f,1580058679.0,"yes, you open up to people only for them to treat your feelings with so much indifference it makes you want to die..."
BreakUps,ffmquzs,t3_eu59df,1580057966.0,the last message i got was a rejection. at this point i am mostly awar that i will receive nothing anymore because i don't mean anything. and that's that.
BreakUps,ffmisi0,t3_etx65l,1580055339.0,"this is some good advice, actually. i feel the same way. i know they don't hate me, but they're indifferent. it doesn't matter. so yeah. people change when it comes to this."
BreakUps,ffmdttr,t3_eu0btu,1580053117.0,"yes and i can't help but obsess over the fact every day even though i try to think about other stuff, i wish i could rip away these feelings from inside me."
bipolar,ffintvq,t3_etn969,1579978340.0,"got dumped about three weks ago, main reason being ""i don't know how to deal with you""

here we go again"
bipolar,ffinngf,t3_etgakc,1579978220.0,"this shit makes me so angry and it's the number one reason why i don't open up to people, especially people who don't suffer with mental illness. it's always about ""love"" and ""be grateful"" and ""TRY HARDER!!"" and ""life is great"". they have no fucking clue what it's like. and the worst of all is ""everybody's got problems"" and/or ""i've been depressed too and i turned out fine"" like good for you, here's your cake. assholes."
