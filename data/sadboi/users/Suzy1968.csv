Im afraid your going to need to tell someone who can comfort you and let you know it's not your fault and you had no control.  I wish that you could of told someone sooner. However, be the guy that goes and seeks help. We are living in times of true evil. It is up to you to fight, don't let them win take your power back but don't let them destroy your soul.  They could not have your Soul.  Their lies your power. They hurt your body but couldn't take your soul. You must reach out to Law enforcement.  Don't be ashamed it happens to many young Men.   I care please don't destroy yourself and definitely this will not make you Gay.  Every Gay Man was not raped. This is a lie, your very Straight."
