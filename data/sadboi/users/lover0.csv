notinteresting,fmlqjln,t1_fmlnh79,1586191380.0,"Oh shit. This triggered me to remember my 5th grade (maybe) locker combination. Whether it was the actual combination, we will never know. Lol I remember it by 0-53-1-5-0-8. Which meant turn it to zero, then to 53, turn it once and hit 5, then turn zero times to 8. Woah that was a weird trigger."
AskWomen,flapg25,t3_fnjuxv,1584988488.0,"I wish I didn't have my insta on private for this. I'm a graphic designer/all around digital creator.
Currently at work, don't have the specific piece on my phone. Will edit with a link when I get home for my first one.  It was a doodle, then slowly evolved into a tattoo idea. Inspiration was Edgar Allen Poe, an album cover from The Matches, and my love for the word 'Nevermore' (A cartoon-y Raven). I love this one so much and it folds me with joy.

Second one I created for a school assignment. It was during my final year, and was my last final. If I didn't pass, I didn't get my degree. That plus my uncle passing away put me in a dark place, I literally had to miss his burial for my final, couldn't afford to not graduate. But [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/64418727/Silver-ADDY-Award-Winner-Magazine-Concept-AD) advertisement came out of it, and I won an award for it. Inspiration was a dark place of fear, anger, and remembering how amazing my uncle was. I love to look at it now, makes me feel like he had something to do with my success in my field."

Pets,f4xugwx,t1_f4xcc81,1571868969.0,"Oh it's fine. I appreciate the help though! She usually does well most of the time, just all of our animals rotate when they decide to be assholes. I even have a dedicated room with a crate just for our dog to keep him away from the cats to try and help calm them but it hasn't seemed to help. T_T this is just my life now."
Pets,f4x09sc,t1_f4wjkhk,1571861339.0,Yup. We have one in each room. Plus the calming sprays with the same formula. we use spray+diffuser in areas where my dog hangs out the most.
Pets,f4vqv9s,t3_dlylmp,1571846495.0,"Omg I feel you. Except BOTH of our cats do this randomly. Once one gets 'better', the other gets worse. We had to live with no material furniture for about 2 years and we're still dealing with it. I've bought the sprays and diffusers, different litters and litter boxes, no plants indoors, no clothes or blankets in reach if them, deterrents, endlessly replacing cords for my computer, etc. The vet head resorted to wanting us to put them on anti depressants because nothing else has helped (we are still on the fence about that). The new vet tries to blame our recent move on their behavior, but honestly this has been going on for at least 4 years and no amount of toys, scratchers, shelves/sitting areas for them, or sprays has helped. They're stressed, and I'm 99% sure it's because of our dog. We've had all three for 7 years now, but it just keeps getting worse. The only thing that works at the moment (because what 'works' changes monthly) is me giving them each individual time with me. We do whatever they want to do. You wanna lay there and sleep? Cool I'll just sit with you for an hour doing nothing. Play? Awesome, I'll get my hand chewed off because one doesn't like toys. Eat? Cool I'll give you treats for tricks. I swear it's like having three toddlers and I literally have to treat it like that. Anyways sorry for venting, but I want you to know that I understand 100%. I will never re home them unless my vet thinks it's best, it's the strongest love-hate relationship I've ever had lol. I hope you find something that works, just remember you have to try and work with their personality, even if asshole is their personality like my Siamese. Good luck!"
sanantonio,f34fx66,t3_dejmz4,1570653772.0,"I think compared to the passed few years, it was a little bit better. They had a lot of issues getting people in. They were supposed to have two different entrances, supposedly one for pre-purchase tickets and another for people buying at the door. Something went wrong and everyone had at least a 20 min wait to get in through one entrance.

They had much more room and more restrooms because of the size of the venues. 

There were great vendors, the bars were still pretty packed, downstairs secluded area for the ""movie screenings"". 

 $10 tiny, ok-tasting street tacos was the only option for food, but at least there was actually good this year! 

Overall it was pretty much the same as usual, just a little more hot, more people, and with more room to explore."

estoration,evti5cy,t3_cl7zbm,1564770907.0,"So I have done photo colorization in the past. My grandfather wants me to restore this newspaper clipping that he's had for years. I've attempted a few times & have given up out of frustration. I have no reference pictures to ""fix"" the facial features, and I don't know where to go from here. Does any one have any advice on where to start? Or tips you use to handle pictures this bad? Thanks in advance!"
TwoXChromosomes,evso2kp,t1_evskmlb,1564752094.0,"I totally agree. I've been going to concerts & being front & center for almost 15 years.  I've had to pull a few people off my partners. The first time I made the mistake of taking a pop-loving guy to a Slipknot concert. There are other things that happened that made him leave early but there was a couple next to us kept grabbing his junk. I had to move infront of him and push them off. Another time this girl was possibly trying to reach in another ex's pocket I assume to steal, but kept reaching in his pants. She would grab his junk & we'd push her off & she'd maneuver her way back & do it again to his ass. Some people really get off on groping & grinding strangers at concerts"
GirlGamers,eu5cedh,t3_cero6z,1563474547.0,"I recently had an odd, yet funny experience. 

I usually don't use voice chat because of this. I started playing with one of my friends lately, who is chill but gets salty & proud when i do well in a new game. (I usually fall behind everyone else because I don't have the attention span to play a 20+ minute game, So when I'm actually winning or out playing my group everyone gets excited.)

Anyways, I was playing with him &like 6 other rando guys. They kept freaking out when I would talk like ""oh shit, an actual girl is playing"" , ""let me teach you how to play"", or some kind of jokey/sexist remark. Then after playing a few games I got tired of them treating me like I didn't know how to play, I honestly was just trying to have fun.  I ended up knocking them all out of the match & it was just my friend &I left. Then I randomly hear ""You, girl!"" We all bust out laughing, like wtf?! I answer him ""You, boy!"". Then he said ""Sorry, I didn't want to call you lover like everyone else, what do I call you?"" I told him my name & he says ""ok, awesome. KICK *friends name*'S ASS!"" 

I was def ready for it to be some sexist remark or some shit, was pleasantly surprised."
depression,etts4pq,t1_etsr2ks,1563194227.0,I'm the same way. At this point I'm too scared to go to the Dr because I know it'll be a commitment if I get diagnosed & that's just too much to think about.
