VeraCrypt,fl44m40,t1_fl1xmj1,1584805784.0,"I'm finding it better to actually store the login info in TXT files within a Veracrypt encrypted container. It's easier to locate files by filename than to try to remember the name of the password and search for that in Kee Pass.

Kee Pass only allows for AES, Twofish and one other. VeraCrypt allows for nesting them like AES(Twofish(Serpent)). I like that VeraCrypt allows me to use any file as a keyfile (it will use the first Megabyte), instead of just .key files that Kee Pass creates. I'd rather not have my key named .key to make it publicly known that that's a keyfile. It's better to have an anonymous mp3 or something else.

With the extension .kdbx it's obvious that it's a Kee Pass database. With Veracrypt you can give the container any name/extension.

Google Cloud is also encrypted end to end, and it gives you some free space with a free gmail account.

Also Kee Pass only does like 10-15 rounds of encryption, where VeraCrypt does 500,000 rounds from what I read."

I've also heard of a person becoming so attached to their teacher that they started growing hair like them. I think you have to become so attached, so enamored with what you are desiring. Yes, believing you already have it helps. I am focusing now on finding one of my dream characters. Actually a Tulpa. You should look into Tulpas too if you're interested."
