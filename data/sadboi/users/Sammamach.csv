AskWomen,fqsn74t,t3_gkgvlg,1589612208.0,"For reference I am 5'3 . I was 30 years old talking to a guy at the service department in the big box store and my 6'0 tall 12 year son came up to me and asked me to buy a video game. I told him that he had to wait till I got paid in a week. As soon as he said ""but mom""  the service guy looked at him, looked at me , looked at him again and asked ""adopted""? LOL . No but I did have him young  at 18 with my 6'2 fiance now husband. 


Another time  my son , then 14 years old and 6'1 , and I were walking at the outdoor mall shoulder to shoulder,  laughing about something and these two older women (definitely 65 and up) started saying loud enough for us to hear ,  how disgusting it was for a 20 year to date a kid. He looked 17 due to his size but you could tell I was older.
My son upon hearing their words put his arm around me and said ""Don't listen to them sweetheart, I love you no matter your age"". 
I started laughing cause I caught on to what he was doing. He was and still is fast witted and  a smart mouth like both his parents. 

Later we where at the food court getting pizza and an officer came up to us and asked us for id.  
We were laughing as we told him the truth, the 2 women were at another table listening.  The officer went to their table, said something we couldn't hear, then he left.
I will never forget that day."

Once high school is over and they get closer to 20 to 21 it will even out. Because the puberty hormones finally relax around that age. At least in our case.


Keep going , your doing great, remember the right meds   and a good therapist are essential.

I told him if he touched her I would be calling the police and divorce lawyers.

They insisted that strict (overbearing) discipline (aka abuse) is the only way to straighten her out.

I know the hurt you are going thru, you truly have my deepest empathy.  It is so much emotional pain that you start to hurt physically. Please call your doctor if possible if you start losing sleep or your stress/anxiety  get so high you can't function. 


I also understand his feelings of being over it and wanting a divorce and there was nothing that could change my mind. (went thru this with my ex not with my husband I have now). So be prepared just incase he has one foot out the door. 


The fact we are in isolation just makes it hurt 100 times worse because you can't separate and take a breather from each other.

 I am a plan A plan B plan C type of person so I always have back up plans for my back up plans.


Logically you need to form a list just incase he does leave.
Start a bank account with just your name on it as soon as you can. 
Start figuring out if you can stay where you are at or if you would have to move. 
Get a copy of all your important papers and photos on the computer.

Second,  anxiety is a voice in the head that does nothing but lie. I suggest finding a therapist  to work on quieting that voice. 

Sometimes we as humans need a little extra help in getting thru past traumas,  and that's ok.

After you are feeling better find a hobby you like and join a group. 
Like cooking classes, workout classes,sewing,  defense course, art, or whatever you are into.

You will meet other people that enjoy the same hobby.
Does your SO like to do anything? You could try their hobby as well.
Most importantly,  be sure not to measure your life by the lives of others. You never truly know what their life really is when behind closed doors.
