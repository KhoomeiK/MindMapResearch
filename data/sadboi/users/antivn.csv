Mexico is also having a huge issue with kidnappings, and the cartel has a grip on the government. Israel and Palestine has terrible conflicts. All of these issues are terrible, to say America is noticeably worse is untruthful. The most progressive people are in Europe and the US, by far. Syrian refugees weren’t welcome in Brazil, but what about people associated with LGBT+? A black person will be seen as a zoo animal in Japan, and someone who’s openly gay/queer/trans or whatever.. will be discriminated against a lot more harshly in other parts of the world than the US. People are still called the N word in Europe. Does that mean everyone in these countries are hostile in the ways I described? Hell no. Am implying that the majority of those people are guilty? Also no. Hostility happens everywhere and it’s usually a minority of the population saying things like that. Still though, some parts of the world will have majorities that hate certain demographics, like Mexico is glaringly homophobic. Most Americans are *not* xenophobic like that. Most Americans are not islamaphobic, homophobic, racist, or anything. A big portion are, but they’re not a majority.

This is like when everyone thinks that Florida is the craziest state but in reality the police departments are a lot more open with the press. You hear about America’s problems more, but in reality we have the same amount of issues, just as bad or even possibly less bad than other countries. Of the first world powers, we have the dumbest government. But the population isn’t as bad as you think it is. If you’re a woman, you will be in more danger in South Africa at night than in Chicago at night, and I’m saying this from experience.

I have family in Mexico that won’t wear masks outside, and many people don’t wear masks. Many more don’t wear them correctly. Sweden isn’t recommending people wear their masks and they’ve been open for the economy for about a month now. All countries have issues that need to be fixed.
