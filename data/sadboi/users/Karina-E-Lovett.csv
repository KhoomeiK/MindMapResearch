  The account is setup and I got the 23&Me data uploaded, but no updates since I’ve filled out their form so idk if I’m missing a step? 🤔 

 Oh wow that’s quite nice of you guys :) What a knowledgeable bunch!"
23andme,fk91epq,t3_fgz0hp,1583966792.0,  Really neat results! You have kind eyes & smile :) Has anyone told you you resemble Tom Welling in “Smallville”?
23andme,fjn8lhr,t1_fjbvqlo,1583501223.0,"   Thank you! Yes, you’re absolutely right - I actually avoided reading further when I first saw no Russian; and was further perplexed as I had no idea what “Anatolian” was.

   Yes, you’re correct again - I was told that I was “fully Russian” but I had my doubts that perhaps I’d be ‘mostly’ Russian but never 0%!

   However, I’ve been learning from everyone in these comments who’ve suggested I may Russian in that “Anatolian” is a conglomerate of various regions such as the Caucuses which are not statistically accounted for. 


   Many have suggested I may be of these ethnic groups present in Russia or from a parent of those heritage.

🖤"
23andme,fjn85kp,t1_fjak0h3,1583500864.0,"I see, these regions are quite diverse I’m quickly learning! Thank you, I’ll check out that wiki page. :)

  Others have asked me the same question, but no city/country/region lights up under any of the pictured results. 

  They all say “Not Detected” and something along the lines of “although we detected Anatolian in your dna, we cannot link this to any region or DNA relative”. Then it shows every country as grey.


Edit: Spelling."
23andme,fjn61iq,t1_fjn4ff2,1583499044.0,"  Hmm, yes that is puzzling. Perhaps one of your parents or even grandparents was European from surrounding regions or even present in one of the ethnic groups of the Caucusus? 


  I’m sorry I’m not much help, as I’m learning quite a considerable amount myself. Have you posted your 23&Me and/or GedMatch results on this subreddit? 

  I’m sure those who’ve helped me and others would offer valuable information regarding the probably implications of your European percentage."

23andme,fjn5r7j,t1_fja8neq,1583498789.0,"   Hmm, wow thank you; you’re information is extremely clarifying. I feel so ignorant about culture & ethnicity trying to deduce the data and inferences of my dna data. 

  Really, the 0.1% of Mongolian confirms the Turk ethnicity? I’ve been told by some people that anything 3% or lower is basically irrelevant. But I think I understand your rationale better - as you’ve described the relevant mixture of present ethnicities to majorities that are ethnic to the region. 

  Sorry for sounding quite repetitive in the comments - but I can’t thank you each knowledgeable & kind person who’s provided insight I’d never surmise! 🖤"
23andme,fjn1zhh,t1_fj9wtgs,1583494936.0,"Hello! Wow, so PVdV22, You & I all share some similar results - really interesting! 

I see, that makes sense, I wasn’t aware of that fact so thank you!  We’re you able to identify or narrow down any possible relatives through this information? 

Where exactly do Chuvash individuals reside in ? Based on what you & PVdC22 have shared, he and others are likely right in speculating that 23&Me groups the Caucusus under “Anatolian”."
23andme,fjn17ys,t1_fjabntr,1583494020.0,"I understand, I’ve done that but unfortunately as I’ve told others, it says “Not Detected” for every countries. I’ve been informed that it’s likely due to the lack of ‘dna reletive-resources” from smaller or less accounted-for countries/regions, ultimately all getting bunched under a general region."
23andme,fjn1312,t1_fja1t83,1583493850.0,"Oh wow - that’s significantly more thorough. Yes I see the large majority is Caucuses & European, that must have been very helpful in clarifying your results. :) Interesting results, I really appreciate your sharing!"
23andme,fjn0v1x,t1_fjcebvo,1583493563.0,"  You’re likely correct - that’s makes sense. I will try to keep this updated, I’m currently trying to download my data from 23&Me as many have suggested GedMatch but I’m having difficulties. 

  So, when I figure it out I’ll definitely let you know as I’m just increasing curious myself!
Thanks again! 🖤"
23andme,fjn0n3k,t1_fjcf84k,1583493283.0,"   Hmm, what an intriguing read - thank you for sharing :) That’s odd that they don’t notify the ‘testee’ of the apparently common “chunking” method.. 
   
   A few others suggested I may be from the Caucuses even though all of those regions/countries said “Not Detected”. 
   
  I’m honestly still stumped as to what my 60% Anatolian and 30% Central Asian infers due to every sub category saying the same as above. 

  Thank you again, that was a helpful article 🖤"
23andme,fjn0glh,t1_fjlcpzm,1583493046.0,"That’s a good suggestion, others pointed that out as well so thank you! :)  Oh ok that’s really interesting, I’ll send them as soon as I figure it out  lol Thanks again 🖤"
23andme,fja10wj,t1_fj9xxqa,1583164104.0,"Yes, I would! I have yet to do so myself and I’ve never seen a report from GedMatch so I’m very curious about all the resources for DNA. :)"
23andme,fj9hwyj,t1_fj9h9bt,1583149114.0,"Wow, literally same with me. Was adopted at 3.5 and apparently I spoke Russian too - all I remembered was yes/no and airplane for some reason lol.

23andme,fj9gzdv,t1_fj9ggrt,1583148024.0,"Yeah, I completely understand that. But congrats on finding a piece of the puzzle - were you able to retain any contact with him or other Azeri relatives? 

Oh okay thank you, so the Caucasus is that entire region of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, etc? 

Yes it really is frustrating - everything is “Not Detected” - did you ever try to learn Russian or look into the culture growing up? I’ve been teaching myself Russian but now I don’t have the incentive after seeing that 0%. 

However, many of those regions have Russian as a national language & integrated culture; so I suppose we didn’t lose too much of what we thought was true."
23andme,fj9ggrf,t1_fj9cena,1583147392.0,"I see your point, why do you think they ‘bunch’ some groups into such broad categories without specification? Lack of relative references in the regions?

Hmm, actually you may be right with the Uzbekistan idea - l recently entered my birth given surname “Zitova” to find its region - and apparently it’s from Tajikistan/surrounding areas.

Overall, your info is very informative & helpful to my view so thank you! :)"
23andme,fj9g3ob,t1_fj9di1q,1583146937.0,"Oh hey, thanks for sharing! :) Wow, it’s really perplexing, isn’t it? 

I see you have a significant portion of European - & we share the Central Asian portion with similar stats.  

Did your results change your perspective or even sense of identity at all? Personally, Russian was the only thing I ever had to connect to my origin etc. So I’m still completely processing what ‘Anatolian’ suggests. 

How did/are you handling your results?
Did you have info about your bio parents ethnicities?"
23andme,fj9fei6,t1_fj9ec0m,1583146046.0,"Hmm, I’ll have to presume along with all your opinions as the report can’t detail any specified region. Ty"
23andme,fj9fadh,t1_fj9d6uw,1583145891.0,"Really?? Wow, honestly I’ve just been extremely receptive and open minded to everyone’s insight as I’m not well-versed in this subject matter. 

If I’m totally transparent, I had no inkling as to what ‘Anatolian’ was when I first got at my results yesterday. 

I see your point - I wish I could provide more info but I don’t know if my parents were Tatar or their ethnicities at all. 

Yeah, it even specifically displays “Russian: Not Detected”, but also “Turkish: Not Detected” - none of those broad listings have detected any region/country when I click for details. 🤔 

Your guess is way closer than anything I could surmise - so Crimean Tatar origins it’s is I suppose. 

Thank you so much - I’m truly grateful for everyone who’s provided insight & support 💕💕"
23andme,fj9c1v9,t1_fj9bb9p,1583141481.0,Oh really? That’s actually quite neat - perhaps so!   Have you taken 23&Me? :)

23andme,fj96z5x,t1_fj9631y,1583134790.0,"Oh wow, that’s actually really interesting! You could very well be correct as I’ve hearing others suggest Turkish/Tatar/Armenian amongst other things."
23andme,fj96dn9,t1_fj95f3g,1583134047.0,"  First off, thank you for taking the time to describe and make inferences - I appreciate it :) 

  Hmm, that’s certainly a plethora of various ethnic routes - I’m immensely curious myself as to which of those or perhaps any other likely explanation is correct. 

  I agree with you and others who suggested the Tatar/Uzbek/Armenian etc as still being viable indicators, regardless as 23&Me listing them as undetected. 

  Due to lack of relatives to reference and/or insufficient amount of data to suggest genetic connections to a region. 

  Currently what you see is all they show me - as no region under any of those broad points can identify even 1 actual country/region."

23andme,fj94v2d,t1_fj92onz,1583132253.0,I agree with you on the Tatar - but it says “not detected for Armenian” ahh lol I’ll never know ^^
23andme,fj90sqj,t1_fj90ez2,1583128009.0,"Hmm okay thank you so much for your feedback- I’m definitely learning a lot from you all! 

That seems to make sense - hopefully one day I’ll be able to dig deeper for affirmation.

Perhaps since 23&Me didn’t test for “Tatarstan” that may be the source of the Anatolian?

Yes it does help, :) I really appreciate your insight 💙"
23andme,fj90jxe,t1_fj8zti5,1583127771.0,My mistake sorry. I’ve looked 20 DNA relatives down the list & they either haven’t filled out their birthplace section (as it’s only displaying mine next to theirs blank) or I have to wait until they accept my invite?

I can see their emotional pain & I want to do something to make them feel better. ***But it feels less like empathy and more like I  just want to make them stop.*** 

At 14, my mom came into my room, sat on the floor and began to sob intensely. Her dad had passed 2 days before Christmas & she was really close to him. 

Immediately — It was like *a* ***switch*** *went off.*  I only felt immensely uncomfortable & disgusted by the amount of emotions she was displaying. *I just wanted her to stop, to get out of my space.* 

I knew I should have done something to console her & that what I felt was wrong. But I felt confused & paralyzed. 

I just stared with glassy eyes while she cried profusely & I heard faint murmurings — she was trying to talk to me. 

&#x200B;

My sister came in and ran to our mom right away to comfort & cry with her. I was just still staring from my bed. 

They comforted each other, and tried to reach to me & say ""It's okay, you can cry. We all loved Poppy (our grandpa) & you'll feel better when you let it out""

But I just said ""Uh no, I'm okay thanks. Sorry"" with an passive expression.

That night when it was just me, I cried angrily, while curled under my covers. I wasn't mourning my grandpa that my sister & I favored; I was crying because *I felt utterly defected and so broken*. I had wanted to connect & to feel upset at his passing - yet I was crying hard because I hated how I could never break the walls I always felt.  I cried because I didn't feel distressed or share my family's grief. 

**How could I feel so numb about my grandpa, that I spent time with from 6 to 14, dying and feel so void while watching my mom & sister sob on my bedroom floor….yet have such unceasing pain and anger that I cry myself to sleep over how much I hated myself & wished I wasn't so broken?**"

I agree with how you say it,' "" remind\[s\] me that I still haven't found where I belong."" 

Which makes sense that even when you feel fine, and get confused at the thought — it's maybe about that feeling ""fine"" or even comfortable doesn't always mean you're finally safe & secure.
