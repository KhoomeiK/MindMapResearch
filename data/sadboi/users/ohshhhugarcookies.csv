Worse still, his parents guilt trip me if I don't look after him even after my therapist told me to stop because it was detrimental to my mental health, and tell me it's the least I can do to look after him. What? You wanted this little demon, it's not my job as his sibling to look after him practically all day every day and bow to his every need. It's yours.</br>

I'll put in here with my own disorder: depersonalization/derealisation disorder. Horrible to live with.

For years in primary school I had the books from classes above since the current books were too easy. I could read at age 3, continued to read probably 5 or more books a day, drew, wrote endless stories and plays, acted, danced, and had the reputation of ""the smart one"".
Mental health downward spiral started at 12. I failed my first exam two years ago and cried for literal hours because I felt like a failure, and I was 1% away from a pass. That was the last year I got a high mark. Haven't got anything higher than 80 since. 
No longer known as the smart one, haven't read a book in months, don't draw or dance, only occasionally write, still act, started drinking.
