No dramas especially romance because I know I’ll never have that and anything that might make me feel things. Sad movies are horrible. 

But weirdly, psychological thrillers, gore and horror is okay. I think I’ve become immune to those things. I prefer the things that keep me feeling numb. I hope horror will scare the shit out of me but not even that"

And it’s always better to know the answer than to not know. To me, having clear cut answers is better than not knowing. I’ve always told the guys I like that I like them. 
As for behaviors changing, it may take a while to get back to being friends but let them know it doesn’t need to be awkward. Don’t give them ultimatums. And just because their behavior doesn’t change, doesn’t mean they like you exactly. It might be that they value your friendship. 
Communication, open discussions (if the other person is cool with it) are important. 
But another important thing is when you’re about to confess your feelings for someone, try to see if they’re ready to hear it. Cause that’s very important. If they’re obviously uninterested, or are taken, or are showing signs of discomfort, it’s not a good idea to proceed.
