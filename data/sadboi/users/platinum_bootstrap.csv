Secondly, your paranoia isn't misplaced or dumb, you've all got respiratory issues and are being extra careful. You might think all you're doing is staying home and being a bum, but think about the indirect impact you're having on the world. You and your family staying in and being safe brought down the number of potential covid cases by 3, and by extension, you've made sure of 3 additional hospital beds being free and saved a medical team that extra bit of work they would have to put in otherwise.

I fucking love the batman movies, so I'll end with one of this quotes, paraphrased:

A hero can be anyone, even someone doing something as simple as staying home in a health crisis, to let their family and their community know they care for their safety.
