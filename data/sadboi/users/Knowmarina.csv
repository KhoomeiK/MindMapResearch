delusionalartists,fqpi7vg,t1_fqphxl2,1589547030.0,I get where they were headed it just needed more time and coats.
delusionalartists,fqphtff,t1_fqpgznk,1589546750.0,I‚Äôm actually taking the time to respond to comments like these even though this post is the same as all the rest on the sub. It meets the criteria of the sub as well. Your problem is with me personally and I‚Äôm finding that very strange.
delusionalartists,fqphiz5,t1_fqpgznk,1589546548.0,"You wouldn‚Äôt even be making this comment right now if this had lower visibility. Which is what I expected. So, no I didn‚Äôt encourage that or expect that. Not to mention everyone here is anonymous."
delusionalartists,fqpfpla,t1_fqp9ata,1589545209.0,Again not my intention. They do claim to be an artist. Just not on those posts. I went to art school with this person and we are not that close. They post artwork almost daily. These are just the DIYs. You can like someone and be critical of them at the same time.
delusionalartists,fqoktjy,t1_fqok5hy,1589517602.0,Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting some comments saying it looks good.
delusionalartists,fqoir2l,t1_fqohrzk,1589516172.0,And I honestly didn‚Äôt look at those comments as people just being supportive. So I think that perspective is helpful. I really thought they must be out of their minds.
delusionalartists,fqoib87,t1_fqohrzk,1589515879.0,"Didn‚Äôt expect this post to blow up and I definitely wasn‚Äôt sure it would count. I thought like two people would agree with me and it‚Äôd go away. I mean all art is subjective, so I‚Äôm not really surprised some people like it. I definitely am not some crazy mean person who wanted to drag them."
delusionalartists,fqohu8c,t1_fqn58i6,1589515571.0,"Yeah, I honestly thought this wouldn‚Äôt count. I‚Äôve never had a post do this well ever. I just posted it because it was just bad work. Didn‚Äôt know it would get traction and we‚Äôd be dragging them."
delusionalartists,fqohkav,t1_fqoh451,1589515393.0,"Yeah, I get that a lot of the posts on this sub are like that. They aren‚Äôt bragging or naming a price or really even a service. I didn‚Äôt think that made them exempt from just doing poorly."
delusionalartists,fqoh2j6,t1_fqnf5zp,1589515080.0,It‚Äôs the outside!
delusionalartists,fqogzgw,t1_fqo0w2t,1589515026.0,Not a retired mom. Young person who calls themselves an artist. They may be enjoying themselves and that‚Äôs well and good. However they seem to think this stuff looks good or is well executed when it isn‚Äôt. Which is why I‚Äôve posted it here.
delusionalartists,fqogp9v,t1_fqnhc8u,1589514844.0,This person considers themselves an artist. They think it looks good. When it just simply does not look good. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve posted this here. This person is not someone I dislike or would ever intend on bullying or being mean to. It‚Äôs really not that deep.
delusionalartists,fqnau59,t1_fqmu4bt,1589491602.0,"Here‚Äôs some of the comments. I went to art school with this person. All of their posts are ‚Äòart‚Äô related. Lots of drawings of fairies and what not. This person is really nice so I do feel a tad guilty, but I couldn‚Äôt resist. Here are the comments: https://imgur.com/a/ckID6za"
delusionalartists,fqn9oep,t1_fqm9rul,1589491035.0,That‚Äôs interesting! I‚Äôm actually a production designer myself and I wouldn‚Äôt hire her as a PA.
