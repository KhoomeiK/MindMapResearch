A cheap bottle of red like Trader Joe's, plus Glühwein spices- a cinnamon stick, some orange peel, a star anise/ginger/whatever warm spice you like (or a TB premade spice blend), sweeten if you must. Simmer in a pot until your kitchen smells good then pour into mugs. 

A good döner on the other hand..."

selfimprovement,flw0n61,t3_fr4e0y,1585536640.0,"Hi OP, I've been telling people that quarantining has given me an excuse for staying home all the time. Many of your milestones are mine as well but I don't mind; the key is to stop comparing yourself to other people. My sister posts to social media several times a day and it feels so artificial- she spends several hours taking pictures of everything and documenting her life because she needs that validation or she's miserable. You are totally overestimating how much fun other people have because social media is curated stories that people want the world to see- people don't post about how lonely they are and how much they need online attention because they don't have good, real relationships with people. There is no normal, only what is normal for you.

 I have moved halfway across the world to start a new life, and turns out I'm just as anti-social in a European capital as I am in the USA. I don't want millions of fake friends though, I want real relationships where I can depend on someone when I need a shoulder to cry on and vice versa. If you are unhappy with life, then by all means change what makes you unhappy! Just don't think that you're abnormal for liking what you like, so maybe what you really need is to learn how to like yourself for you."

fatlogic,flb5cmu,t1_flakjdp,1584997709.0,"Hi OP, let's try bumping up your question.

It's so hard because she feels attacked every time you bring up her weight; it's irrational but talking about her weight makes her feel less attractive and less lovable. If you want to help her to get healthy, then it has to be a group effort- without mentioning her weight, tell her that you've been concerned about your own health lately and you want to try Whole 30 and say that it'd be so much easier for you to both to do it together to keep each other accountable. Emphasize how much you love her and enjoy doing things together (don't talk about her weight at all). Even if she ultimately decides not to do it with you, tell her that having junk food and convenience foods are too much of a temptation for you and you'd like to throw them away and not buy them anymore for the next month. Be prepared to cook all your meals and meal prep: have one big cooking day a week, then stash the leftovers in microwavable portions for each meal and let her know that you've made single serving portions for her meals too just because it's just as easy to cook for one as for two people. If there is healthy, easily accessible food, then she'll be more likely to eat that and be satisfied with healthy food so to be less likely to reach for the junk, even if she doesn't agree to get rid of the junk.

Go for walks together, just around the neighborhood. Go watch the sunset together in the park and talk about your dreams for the future. Talk about active things you liked doing together before. Always be careful not to seem judgmental but to mention how much you love her and want to spend more time doing things together.

Good luck!
