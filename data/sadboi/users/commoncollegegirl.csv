phoenix,fpe29e9,t3_gctyu4,1588538918.0,"I have a July birthday too, for my 21st I went to the Arizona Grand Hotel! It’s $50 per day entry fee and they have a lazy river, slides, and a bar (and cabanas with service if you’re willing to dish out $200). It was awesome and a really nice way to stay cool and get ridiculously drunk. I rented a room and stayed with my friends overnight so I didn’t have to Uber home! If anything, I think old town Scottsdale is 10x better than Mill. Have fun!!!

Edit: also, it may be fun to try and sneak in some alcohol to one of the water parks we have here (they might sell, I’m not sure). Wet n Wild is awesome and so is Big Surf, couldn’t imagine how fun they’d be tipsy!!"

When this happens to me, I try to find evidence that isn’t true. For example, she’s still been sending me pictures and memes on Instagram, and knowing her if she hated me she would’ve blocked me. It’s hard to get rid of those thoughts, but taking the time to rationalize works for me for a while. Hope this helps!"

I feel less guilt now than I did when I was still religious. I was constantly worried then about whether or not i was “being a good Christian” and feeling like a hypocrite if i wasn’t. I just know now I’m happier and a lot less stressed than I was when I was religious."
