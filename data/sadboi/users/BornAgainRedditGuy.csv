ContraPoints,fpw7v8c,t3_gfu7uh,1588958765.0,"I'm a cis-het man with a lot of traditionally masculine qualities. I've been compared to Ron Swanson a lot, which I'm conflicted about. But I also suffer from bipolar disorder. I ignored my mental health for a very long time to serious detriment to myself, and I believe this is because of the expectations of masculinity. It took me going to the darkest place I've ever been before I finally swallowed my pride and sought treatment. 

But it's not all butterflies and sunshine yet. Medication helped, but I was put on the wrong medications (VERY common among those with bipolar) and I didn't bother talking to my psychiatrist about it because I just wanted to get our appointments over with. Each appointment with him was 5 minutes at the most. I was cool with that until I got tired of the side-effects of my medication and developed a drinking problem as a coping mechanism. 

I still couldn't talk about my suffering with anyone. Jim Beam became a father figure to me.

But I'm trying to do my part in fighting the stigma against mentally ill men. I'm beginning to open up to friends and family, mostly just telling them I am bipolar and speaking about it clinically. They aren't ready to hear about my episodes in detail haha. Also, quarantine has been really rough on me and triggered a bunch of fucked up shit. I'm a grad student but I haven't been able to do any work on classes or my thesis. Yesterday I finally swallowed my pride and emailed my professors about what was going on, and told them I needed to drop my class/put my thesis off for now. They were very supportive and I'm glad I did that.

As I get more comfortable, I want to become more publically open about my struggles because it's bullshit that I should feel the need to ignore my suffering and power through it. I have a lot of traditionally masculine qualities and I like a lot of traditionally masculine things, not out of insecurity but because that's genuinely who I am. But even then, I ignored and hid my mental health struggles out of pride and to a greater extent, fear. 

I really want better discussion on men's issues. Discussions about them now devolve into toxic arguments that don't do shit for anyone. It's bullshit that I should feel ashamed of mental health issues I have no control of, and it's bullshit that I should feel the need to hide my struggles out of fear having my masculinity challenged and not being taken seriously as a man."
bipolar,fpvsbsf,t3_gfmssm,1588950939.0,"So I emailed my professors yesterday. This quarantine has fucked me up and I haven't been able to do any work for over a month. I have to drop a class so I dont mess up my GPA and I have to put my thesis research on hold. In fact, my masters program has a non-thesis option so I might just go with that since I kind of hate research haha. I like reading academic papers and knowing what's going on in my field, but that's about it. 

So I told my professors whats been going on. I didn't outright say I'm bipolar, but I did say I suffer from a ""debilitating mental illness"" that has made quarantine especially rough on me. They responded and were surprisingly supportive! They encouraged me to stick with it but ultimately supported my decisions. It feels good to not completely hide my experiences."

I wasn't straight up saying ""Fuck America"", but considering how conservative my family is, I might as well have. I remember saying something about caring more about immigrants than I do about a flag, and then my uncle started cussing me out in the comments and my mom was texting me about it. I could tell from her tone in the texts that she was really uncomfortable. I ended up deleting my facebook, mostly for my mom.
