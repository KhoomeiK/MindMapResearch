ptsd,fqvkpw2,t1_fquksgo,1589679355.0,">I think it works like this in my brain: if I 'consent' to sex then it is admitting I enjoyed the abuse too. But if sex is forced on me (even just me pretending it is) then somehow I'm not responsible. I feel horrible afterwards and cold and empty and small. I know my logic is twisted but shame and guilt stop me from fully expressing these thoughts either to my partner (who wouldn't get it anyway) or therapists.

your logic isn't twisted at all. Many other survivors have those same feelings. I've worked with my therapist on similar thought patterns and there is a reason our brains work this way - trying to keep us safe."

Because I was exposed to sex at such a young age, I have involuntary arousal responses to things that are similar to my own childhood assaults. I took many years of therapy to address the shame. I now have a better understanding that arousal does not mean enjoyment, consent, or acceptance. 

I went through a period where I was obsessed with reading transcripts from law enforcement sting operations where they try to catch childhood predators. I had so much shame about seeking that out but also that I would be aroused when reading it. I worked on this in therapy and feel like I am in a better place to understand why my brain does what it does. 

I debated whether or not to reply to this but I think it's so important to reduce the stigma around this."

When confronted with what that is actually like she, instead of being open that she maybe wasn't bi, she had an over the top reaction to other things to create conflict during the trip. I think this was a way to convince herself that something Erika did or does is a reason to not be together and Stephanie doesn't have to admit that it has anything to do with her sexuality.

This also is a scenario that many queer women worry about when getting involved with straight or bisexual women. It isn't fair to the bi community which is why I hope so much that Stephanie can live her truth and get whatever help she needs to accept her sexuality, whatever it may be."

I want to validate that feeling that you are never going to get better. I felt that so strongly. Like I was just going to be terrified for the rest of my life.

It DOES get better though. It happens slowly so you can't always see the progress you've made. Even as you get better, you still will have those feelings of doubt that your life will be normal again. That is our PTSD talking. Hang in there as best as you can. Be compassionate with yourself if you don't have the means for therapy or a doctor right now. Try your hardest to get help when you can."

ILTrees,fp5v6pd,t3_gbi0lr,1588340622.0,"when you place your order on MOCA's website, it will give you the total inclusive of taxes and that is the exact amount of cash you need. All prices on products on their site have taxes included as well. There is no option to tip as far as I'm aware. Edited to add: you have place your order online first. They aren't accepting walk-ins.

Some other tips for your visit: you need to wear a mask. They are only allowing one person inside the vestibule at a time. Have your medical card and an ID ready, and the last three digits of your order number. When you get in, there is a waiting area to the left with chairs. There are two ATMs if you need them. Hang a right when you enter. 

The budtenders are now behind plexiglass and will scan the barcode on the back of your card through the glass. They also have some barriers to keep you 6 feet away from the counter. There is hand sanitizer at each register.

Have fun! Everyone I've interacted with at MOCA is super chill."
ptsd,fp5ntm8,t3_gbdxo4,1588335473.0,"All the time and even from people who are part of my support system. I've learned a few things: There are some people don't understand mental health or the physiology of mental health. There are also people who do not have the skills to navigate their own discomfort, and so when someone talks to them about something difficult, they try to avoid those feelings by shutting it down. And I now know which people in my support network are better equipped to help or listen than others.

I started either stating upfront what my needs are. Like telling my dad I just want someone to listen and I don't need solutions or advice. And really the biggest thing for me was understanding who is helpful and who is not, and avoiding talking to people who responded in an invalidating way. While that made my list of support people smaller, I have far fewer unhelpful conversations with friends/family."
ptsd,foy87dr,t3_ga5na0,1588167493.0,"I don't think anyone can provide even a general time frame. It depends on the trauma and individual. PTSD also seems to be a chronic disorder as someone else commented, so your ""recovery"" might be managing symptoms vs. absence of symptoms. Recovery or being better is going to be different for each person.

I wish there was a treatment that was more definitive. Like take these pills and in 6 months you will be in recovery! But I'm going on 7+ years of therapy. I've made amazing progress, and recovery is in my sights but I'm not there yet."
ptsd,foy72xw,t3_ga2239,1588166785.0,"My therapist and I have been doing parts work for many years. It has been the most helpful for me in understanding the different ways my brain responded to trauma. I also think it helps to know how your brain tries to keep you safe. 

The most challenging part of it for me has been thinking about what my brain needed at the time, which we talk about when going through different events. But when we work through different traumas I now can identify which parts of my brain reacted in what way and why. 

This type of therapy work is pretty draining for me and I notice it can take 3-4 days for my brain to process and recover after."
