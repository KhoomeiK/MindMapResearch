naranon,ffemw26,t3_et2uq7,1579855036.0,"I mean, whatever.. I feel like I‚Äôll be crucified online for this but my ex got deep into multiple drugs. Got pulled over one night and got arrested on possession and paraphernalia charges. When his case went to court a month/month and a half later he was in over his head. 

Things got delayed in court that day and I remember being outside the courtroom talking to his arresting officer who I previously known, and I asked him like can they please just convict him so he will get drug court. It wasn‚Äôt serious enough I‚Äôd have to testify or anything along those lines, but just talking to an officer and pleading to convict him felt like a huge betrayal on my part. But I was desperate and he was in need of desperate help. 

The prosecution ended up making a clerical error so my ex and the other dude he was representing got charges completely dropped and walked free that day. He moved out the same day and within less than a week he‚Äôs living in a shed at his drug dealers house. 

So while I can‚Äôt exactly answer your questions, I just came here to say do what you have to do. My ex and I had years together while he was sober and that‚Äôs all I ever knew him as and this shit got ahold of him and tore a life a part he spent years resurrecting. It‚Äôs been a few years now since we parted ways but last I heard he‚Äôs still struggling and the shit has a deathly hold on him. People are responsible for the decisions THEY make. And I know it might feel conflicting at the time, if you can get them help by involving law enforcement... well..? I don‚Äôt know. 

Most states to my knowledge have programs to where he will be offered help instead of jail (as long as he‚Äôs not doing some big shit like trafficking). And if they complete the program the charges are dropped and off their record. And they work with you like if he slips up but has been putting a genuine effort in they won‚Äôt crucify him. However if he shows zero desire to change and continues on with the drug life he will be charged and sentenced. 

So either way he is going to be responsible for his own actions. At least if the courts are involved he will have the opportunity to get help and in my opinion have some sort of understanding of his options and know there is help out there. Do what you feel is right. I know it feels wrong but would you rather do nothing and have him lose his life? While that would NOT be on your shoulders AT ALL, I know myself it would probably haunt me. And I knew at the end of the day with my ex I did everything I could to help him which made walking away ‚Äúeasier‚Äù. 

You should check out naranon meetings. It‚Äôs like NA/AA for family members. I met some amazing people through them they helped me get through one of the toughest times of my life. Don‚Äôt be nervous about them either, in my experience everyone at those meetings has been in your shoes and has felt that incredibly painful hurt of loving an addict leading, which led them to seek out a support group. Again IME it‚Äôs a judgement free zone and there‚Äôs people there who love someone struggling at all stages of addiction.. so they can offer a lot of advice and insight.

Think of it this way if you get off subs to appease your gf but end up struggling so much you relapse, doesn‚Äôt sound like she‚Äôll stick around for that either. 

I get where she‚Äôs coming from kinda. My now ex bf was in active heroin addiction while I was not. I had to start at the very beginning of the learning curve and there were many instances where I‚Äôd find his dope or catch him high after so many repeated promises he had/would quit. 

Eventually I was beyond fed up, told him he could get clean or get out. But he was lying so much and I was second guessing my own reality. 

After I gave him his 527th chance, one of my things was him agreeing to let me drug test him whenever I wanted. If he had actually been making a genuine effort to quit, in my eyes the drug testing was part of rebuilding trust. 

Anyways at the end of the day it was an extremely unhealthy relationship, I was codependent as fuck. I seriously felt like I was losing my mind and I think I pretty much was until I found naranon.

TLDR; you have to do what‚Äôs best for you. She may be becoming codependent which isn‚Äôt healthy for either of you. May be worth taking some time apart

Edit, adding this: slipping up doesn‚Äôt make you weak. This stuff is not easy to get off of, it‚Äôs actually notoriously hard. And I don‚Äôt think you suck because ‚Äúyou lied‚Äù.. she‚Äôs forcing you to do something you‚Äôre not comfortable with and possibly backing you into a corner. If she‚Äôs gonna stick around she needs to understand recovery isn‚Äôt linear. There‚Äôs set backs. It‚Äôs not healthy to have your entire relationship being contingent upon you never making a mistake."

Addiction is beyond shitty. It‚Äôs devastating. Get out while you can. Especially if you‚Äôve been in abusive relationships before, if try to make it work I feel like you‚Äôre heading down a long miserable road of codependency.

If you really want to get fancy, this [product](https://www.amazon.com/Differin-Adapalene-0-1-Acne-Treatment/dp/B07L1PHSY9) is like an OTC retinoids BUT DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE STARTING THIS**

It‚Äôs not something you should just start using blindly. (It‚Äôs awesome tho, highly suggest it if you‚Äôre up to it. I use tretinoin) I use the cerave every day and I love that stuff! The niacinamide in the first one and the vitamin C in the second are both things that‚Äôll help fade those marks. 

I‚Äôd head over to r/skincareaddicts there is a TON of info on that sub. If you do decide to buy a higher end product r/skincareexchange usually has discounted stuff. 

Closing thoughts..
 1. Your skin doesn‚Äôt define you. It doesn‚Äôt make you any less of a person and people usually don‚Äôt notice all the things we hyper focus on. 

2. I get it. I‚Äôve struggled with acne and the aftermath for the last ~15 years. It‚Äôs rough and I know the feeling. But there are things you can do and eventually it will all fade and be back to normal. 
Keep your head up! üòä"
OpiatesRecovery,fbyvjrx,t3_eezw2e,1577227486.0,"TLDR; sappy post. This sub is cool. We don‚Äôt judge. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, this is a pretty safe place. I‚Äôm not as active here as I used to be but all I‚Äôve ever seen is mass amounts of kindness and support from this community. 

Some people here have an hour clean, some have years clean. Although our individual situations may differ, we‚Äôve all experienced our own hell with opiate addiction and recovery. 

We also all came to this sub for a reason. In my case it was desperation, and when internet strangers help you through something like that it makes for a great feedback loop where you then want to help the next person who is struggling. 

Glad you ended up posting and I hope you continue to in the future so you can see it‚Äôs all gravy baby.                          We on that ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ peace love & positivity bullshit here!"

I want black outs but it‚Äôs so that people can‚Äôt see in..

Sometimes it does you better to just accept how you feel and embrace it a little. Let yourself go through the motions without the guilt. And yes someone somewhere probably has it harder and it could always be worse etc etc but it doesn‚Äôt invalidate what you‚Äôre experiencing and you shouldn‚Äôt put yourself down for feeling the way you do <3

StopSpeeding,f38piko,t1_f37g0td,1570738661.0,I see the logic behind the idea but adderall is also so easily abused and can put you in a pretty dark hole that‚Äôs difficult to climb out of :/

A lot of people may steer you away from it bc it can be habit forming in its own way, but do what you gotta do. If you have a support system to give you accountability that‚Äôs helpful. And even if you don‚Äôt have family or friends that‚Äôll fill that role you always have us. This subreddit has helped me immensely. 

Good luck friend. You can do this!!"
