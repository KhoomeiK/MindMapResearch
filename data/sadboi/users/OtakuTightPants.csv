AskWomen,faltsee,t3_e9l24x,1576190330.0,"When he first asked me to be his girlfriend I actually turned him down. I was in a really awful place mentally from some abusive relationships and he was so nice and normal and genuine I didn't think it would be right to go down that road. In a way, he was too perfect and that scared me. He said he didn't mind any of that, but he understood and would still like to keep hanging out like we had been if I was cool with it. 

That felt like a huge red flag. I thought he was only pretending to understand so that he could stay in the game and keep trying, and now he knew I was vulnerable. But he legit stayed a proper friend and was there for me and we had fun. He never tried it on with me again, never made any hints or made me uncomfortable or anything. There was a house party at his place and part way through the night I changed my mind, and I kissed him. He gently moved away and said he still really liked me like that so not to think that he was rejecting me, but he respected my decision to turn him down before. So if I wanted this to go anywhere when I was sober, then I should let him know when I've really thought about it, and if I decided that I wanted to stay friends instead then that's great too. He wasn't going to chase and put any pressure on me, it had to come from me if I was sure.

No man had ever treated me like that before and it only made me like him more. But I was still afraid. 

Some time after that something happened and he saw me have a complete mental collapse. I was shaking, I didn't know where I was, and it was awful. I was scared to see him after that, my friends told me he had been there and had been so worried. I figured I'd blown my chance now he had seen what he was really signing up for. 

We get married next year and I have never had a better friend in all my life."

When they prove to your face that's not true, it throws all your judgement into question, every word they've said, everything you've talked about. It hurts.

I'll never forget asking my (ex) boyfriend to just tell me the truth: Had he slept with my best friend. I already knew the answer, she had shown me their entire chat history. She even pinpointed exactly when each time had happened and it correlated with the alibis that never checked out and the weird behaviour.

He looked me in the eye and told me 'no, how could I possibly think that of him, was his love not enough, why did I have to sabotage our love this way.' he became aggressive. 

As soon as the screenshots came in he went quiet. Shrugged. I asked again. He nodded. Its things like that that change your relationship with yourself and your own judgement for a long time.

But that only applies if the information is something you can easily find out for yourself. If it's not, then it's senseless waste of time, lazy management and poor effort. Does my head in."

weeabootales,f46usyg,t3_da626n,1571413723.0,"From my narrow experience, I've met weebs I get on with really well who are super nice and weebs like you've described. 

In general I find that their superiority complex is usually due to incredibly low self esteem, (usually thanks to being bullied for their likes and odd behaviour as kids.) Now they are older and see there is a whole community of people 'like them'  and they think they can be the king of it and will become the bully (or try).

I used to date a guy like this and my word was he obnoxious about this stuff. I knew a little more about anime than he did but that didn't stop him from gatekeeping and bullying and putting me down. I knew him all through highschool and college as a friend so I saw it progress. He was a quiet, odd and lonely boy who was bullied. Then he started dressing in Asian clothes at college and he got a taste of people thinking he was cool and unusual and fed off it. What a jerk he was."

There's a long wrong with the standard work model and due to profit focus, it won't change on mass. It's sad.
