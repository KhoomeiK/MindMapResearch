rant,eypazmf,t1_eyo5mxo,1567294986.0,"I know how you feel. I think In your case you need to find people who accept you for who you are. People who are with you not for some bullshit reason, but because they feel comfortable around you. I’ve realized this ages ago, but the society we live in can’t come to accept us the way we are. There’s nothing wrong with us. It’s the others who can’t learn to love a person for who they are. I can sympathize with you, know you aren’t alone and continue forward.

Ps. You play Minecraft??"

rant,eydo3c6,t3_cwdq1f,1567022018.0,"I understand you. I know how you feel. People just don’t understand. People can’t grasp the emotions of person and the mind of it. Putting 2 people together won’t always spark something, and I’ve come to understand it’s the different kinds of company that can really change the way you feel in the moment and how you exchange with others. I have some extroverted friends and feel comfortable talking to them. I don’t really like to talk people normally, I like to be alone often times. Just because I’m alone doesn’t mean I’m lonely. I believe that introverts like us have a different mindset than most people, that we have the ability to enjoy our time alone. That we can be alone and have fun."

SuicideWatch,ew87gum,t3_cn9mum,1565204836.0,"It seems as though its just depression, but it must be deeper than that, suicide is not easy to deal with, for the ones left behind, but do they ever consider the victims feelings? The suffering of the one now dead? I know how bad things must for one to want to commit suicide, but things can get better. People will say “things will get better”, that is not true, you can only rely on yourself to change. Hold on to hope for better days where you will see the light of your time. I want to go too, but I don’t know if it’s the answer anymore as I only want to go quickly and painlessly."

Ask her about her feelings and try to get her to open up about her day to day thoughts. Leaving them alone would not help, as the time alone would only let their thoughts consume them. Keep her busy, do nice things for them. Spend time with them...if only someone did this for me."

I’ve gone to multiple therapy sessions, and I realized that the therapy sessions I’ve gone to, were of no use, the therapy only analyzes the root/source of your suffering, only telling you why you suffer so and they try to tell you how to cope and and how to recover, but that doesn’t work for everyone, as those methods seems to only work for the short while."
