Art,fh648ey,t1_ewvrm4a,1581295037.0,"  This post is from so long ago but I need you to know that your post helped me more than anything else. Idk why. It just hit me that art is subjective and I create. I may never hang in a gallery but I've gotten so much confidence I am doing the best work of my life. It's helped my anxiety and self esteem. And if someone asks, ""are you an artist?"", I don't hesitate. I say ""yes."" 
    I cannot thank you enough for your post. You changed my life for the better and I thought you should know that."

So I was doing serious damage by trying to convince myself to shut up and ""not worry people."" 

Never again will I ignore that feeling. My body/brain was doing all it could for self preservation. Being made to feel like a baby or whiner made it so much worse and it took me months longer to get help. 

To anyone else that feels this way, don't dismiss your feelings. Don't feel like you shouldn't be expressing how you feel. And please, never, ever feel like you need to suck it up. If you don't have a PCP, find a clinic. That's #1 on the list."

To be clear, I'd I think my art is good I'm good. I don't really need accolades. It's a nice thought but...,
Anyway, I'm working on my drawing skills more and I really hate perspective. All I see is geometry. 
I'm more old fashioned(bc I'm old) and prefer a book for reference. I'm not sure if I get an art book on perspective or a geometry book or just keep drawing like the kids in my Pre-K class. 
Any ideas? For books? Or free classes? 
Thanks"

        As a person who has suffered depression on and off(mostly on), all my life, I get really annoyed when someone says to just be more positive. It's like, do you really think I'm not trying that? It's hard. 
       So I agree. Express your ideas, frustrations and your own feelings of helplessness to someone else. And just listen to the person who needs it the most. Talking is so cathartic. Being judged , or worried about being judged, is not."
