Herpes,fnkhro4,t3_g2agy9,1587027534.0,Hey it will be ok. How long have you had it? Are you on daily valtrex?
relationship_advice,fmh2yom,t3_fv7a5k,1586065067.0,"Ah man I also don’t live with my SO and that would be my worse nightmare. Honestly I would try to go there and confront both her and the other housemate who told you asap. Its way harder to lie when you’re put on the spot directly. If she did cheat on you with her housemate she is honestly a piece of shit and you should be thankful for the other housemate for telling you. Honestly as terrible as it is she would have probably cheated on you later on or maybe she already did before. You deserve so much better. Also, the fact that she didn’t want to move in with you during the lockdown is a redflag to me personally. Its a crazy time right now and you should want to be with the person you love. If she did cheat please dont take her back. Being drunk is not an excuse. Women can sense when guys are into us and she most definitely knew her housemate was into her. Be careful that asshole person is out of your life. I would never ever cheat on anyone especially not with my own housemate that’s disgusting"
BreakUp,fmggbjz,t3_fv2u0a,1586048402.0,This relationship doesn’t seems healthy. I think its perfectly fair to get nervous if you find another women dirty underwear in the room. He seems to be pretty self centered and him yelling is never ok. Pi know its hard but I think you re going to be way better off long term. Just move with your parents and dont take him back. You can do this. You deserve better <3
relationship_advice,flmr8ff,t3_fpj79x,1585293328.0,"Honestly, from my experience, if you dont feel like you belong in a group, don’t try to force it.

childfree,fktg8r6,t1_fktc61j,1584518412.0,"Thank you for your kind message!

No it’s definitely not something she wanted but at the same time she is the one who decided to have a kid too you know. I know I am uncapable mentally of taking care of a child so thats why I stay childfree. 

I really dont want to go back to Canada as I just paid 3000$ for my visa and I have nowhere to go back to. I have been living in Australia for 2 years. My question was more if I try staying in my houseshare and possibly struggle with rent or if I try to move in with her and make it work temporary living with a kid even though I am not a fan of children"
childfree,fktg453,t1_fkta8nn,1584518251.0,I really do not want to come back to Canada right now. I have no where to go and no money and no jobs there either and was really depressed there thats why I left. I am trying to think what could help me handle living with a child and see how long I could last... this whole thing just remind me how much I am grateful to be childfree
childfree,fktg17k,t1_fkt7jab,1584518149.0,"I feel like my options are pretty limited. Right now I really do not want to go back to Canada as my life is here, the weather is good and I just love my sister we only have each other. I might try and discuss with her to plan on an agreement so I am not a fully time nanny and I guess to try and look for another job so I can move out but yeah I am scared of the effect it will have on my mental health"
Herpes,fjyybv3,t1_fjuxuay,1583707211.0,Just want to say that I am on a visa in Australia and been on Valtrex for a year. No issues although they usually only give you 5 months prescription at the time but it is worth it. You should definitely get him on antiviral as it will reduce the chance of transmission to you!
HSVpositive,ffzucwg,t3_evyp37,1580393117.0,I am 100% sure its triggered by hormones! I only ever got my ob on my period!
Herpes,fepqqqe,t3_eqb3b9,1579328119.0,"I have ghsv2 and I am pretty sure I gave it to my current partner. When I disclosed to him he admitted he already had oral hsv1 and ghsv1 so I was a bit upset that he was not going to disclose. I think I passed it to him because we had sex on my period and I only ever had ob on my period. (I wasn’t having one at the time as I am on daily valtrex but I still think the virus was present as I felt some tingling) I felt absolutely terrible when I found out but the fact he already had genital herpes made me feel less bad about it. At the end of the day, if you disclose you shouldn’t feel too bad if they catch it as you were honest and you gave them the choice."

I would constantly check my boxer area to make sure I didn’t have anything. I was soooooo scared of giving it to him. Then honestly I realized herpes is so common that if he isn’t with you, he might just get it from someone else. Most people dont know they have it so hes actually safer with you who takes antivirals then sleeping with random people. Best of luck"
Herpes,fblu7m4,t3_edvwe3,1576970398.0,So many people have hsv1... I am on the other extreme where I tell everyone I have genital herpes and feel no shame at all. It wasn’t my fault.  I think your reaction is not normal. Maybe therapy could help.
Herpes,fbac59v,t3_ecbxm9,1576673679.0,Omg I had the same problem the whole first month I was diagnosed!!!!!! I had to buy strong deodorant and use it at night. It got better after the second month but even after 9 months i still feel like i sweat more than normal so definitely was a thing for me

Herpes,f8r2k2t,t3_e1plbk,1574730373.0,"Awww thats amazing you met someone you really like! Do you know what type of hsv you have? Because if its hsv2 the chance of transmission by oral sex is extremely low, and even if she did get it orally it would be the best kind of herpes to have as it would protect her from getting hsv2 genitally (after her antibodies settled) and hsv2 orally shed the less and for most people you get one cold sore one time and thats it.

I would remove the phrase about it being a deal breaker just say that you think its important to disclose even though most doctors and people don’t think it is!

Let us know how it goes :)"

truechildfree,f89yu1c,t3_dzkmc9,1574383293.0,I am so sorry your mother is telling you those things. She is the one who decided to have children. You never asked to be born. Growing up my mother used to tell us that she « sacrificed » her life for us. I always thought it was a horrible thing to say and I guess it traumatized me into not having children myself. I cut ties with my mother when I was 20 and I am 28 now. Much happier without her in my life. Somehow I guess maybe I am glad she traumatized me from ever having children of my own because I really doubt I would enjoy being a mother and I think it would destroy me.

Herpes,f7pigfv,t3_dxdqar,1573949780.0,HSV is so common especially HSV1! I can relate to you so much its really hard getting diagnosed. When I first got diagnosed my doctor thought I had GHSV1 and I still thought it was horrible but then found out it was GHSV2 and freaked out even more because its more contagious and usually have more OBs and less people have it. However I still managed to make peace with it I guess? Its been about 9 months now and it doesn’t affect me that much and I dont think about it too much. I take Valtrex every day and dont have sores anymore. Honestly you ll be ok! I wish I had hsv1 instead and most people with it dont even disclose! You re a good person for wanting to disclose!
birthcontrol,f7nlu3e,t3_dx0js5,1573909857.0,"So I have been trying 3 birth control lately increasing the strength every time.  
Loette 20mg estrogen 100mg progesterone 
Levlen or seasonique 30 estrogren 100 progesterone
And finally Diane 35. 35 estrogen 150 progesterone

I found that the stronger the pill was, the less I wanted sex. Bare in my mind that I have an actual crazy strong libido where its actually been an issue in my life when I am not on birth control. However with this new pill Diane 35, i experienced what it was like to have a low libido for the first time in my life and its not fun at all!!!!!! My vagina cant get wet anymore and its only been a month. I stopped the this today because I had enough and went back to seasonique... hopefully it will go back to normal.

What pill have you tried?"

Herpes,f7hkfkb,t3_dw5rtd,1573742420.0,Go girl. I went through this shit as well and at this point  I think herpes can be a blessing as it shows you who is really interested in you for you and who just wanted to use you for sex. Also it shows you who is dumb and educated and who is willing to educate themselves and do their own research.
Herpes,f7hjihr,t3_dw2b8i,1573741907.0,Yep. Most people are so ignorant.
birthcontrol,f7hj7at,t1_f7g76bd,1573741727.0,Hey. Thank you for your answer. Thats what I was told too but I honestly am struggling so much I dont know how long I can last! I am thinking of switching tomorrow!
birthcontrol,f7hizvv,t1_f7gbb1k,1573741614.0,"Hey. I know that all birth control gives you an increased chance in having a blood clot but this pill has an increased chance than the others which is why its not approved in the USA and was banned in France.

Also, I am not googling my medical problems, I am googling the drug I was given in and what the side effects are as I was not told those informations by my doctor. Furthermore, I found this official information from Bayer itself saying that this birth control shouldn’t be prescribed as a BC only and should only be prescribed in cases of severe acne and excessive body hair. 

https://www.bayer.ca/omr/online/diane-35-pm-en.pdf

I know I am not a doctor but doctors are only humans and they can be wrong and I think looking up what drugs you put in your body is a smart thing to do."

Herpes,f7fsjqs,t1_f7eeldk,1573685768.0,Thats amazing! I am really happy for you that it is working thank you so much for answering me! Did you have any problems with depression or mood swings with previous pills?
Herpes,f7e3ec9,t1_f7dk44o,1573644644.0,Wow thats amazing! So how often do you get your period now? How do you know you contracted hsv2 if you never had any symptoms? Thank you so much for your answer btw <3

Herpes,f7e2tyf,t1_f7d8nhe,1573643822.0,"Hey thank you so much! my doctor gave me a script for both seasonique and levlen and after reading the ingredients, Levlen and seasonique are the same but seasonique has those low estrogen pill during the bleeding week. So I basically tried Levlen and was fine mentally and physically but had a 1 or 2 spotting and therefore experienced prodrome symptomes ... I still have the script for seasonique so I am wondering if I should just give it a go and see if my body adapt. I was just so hopeful with this strong new pill as I haven’t experienced hsv prodromes symptomes on it yet (but all the side effects are killing me) can I ask if you still have Ob or prodrome on ur bleeding weekv"
Herpes,f32lycu,t3_dfe10a,1570617148.0,I relate so much to this. I was feeling the same way. But yeah at the same time you get to build a relationship on trust and honesty and once you disclosed the sex is pretty much the same honestly!
Herpes,eyxcx82,t3_cyrix4,1567550217.0,I was extremely tired the first month of my initial OB and it went back to normal afterwards!
Herpes,eyprmpt,t3_cy4ffp,1567308959.0,I like the way you disclose but you shouldn’t be so hard on the herpes virus. Its just a skin condition that most people have anyway. If its a dealbreaker for them then casual sex should also be a dealbreaker because 1 in 6 people have genital herpes and it can be spread with a condom. But yeah then again you re right it could be a dealbreaker for some people like dating a smoker or someone who wants or has kids would be to someone else. <3
Herpes,eypr51m,t3_cy3mqe,1567308513.0,"Hey! I just wanna say that I was feeling the exact same thing as you for at least 2-3 months after my diagnosis. ( i was diagnosed in February ). getting diagnosed with an STI for some reason in this society is way more traumatic than any other virus that are contagious but not just ”sexually”. So yeah when you get diagnosed with an incurable STD you fucking freak the fuck out especially if you re a good person and want to disclose. Truth is, SO many people have herpes it is so fucking common but most people dont talk about it and A LOT of people dont disclose. Anyway, getting diagnosed really traumatized me and I even fell into a depressive hole after it (not just because of herpes but mostly). I felt the exact same. When i was walking on the street and a cute guy was checking me out I was thinking « well whats the point I am undesirable now he wouldn’t like me if he knew ». I also felt like I was hiding a big secret from everyone so I just started casually talking about my genital herpes to everyone around me, my coworkers, my friends, my family... anyone! And guess what? Most people didn’t care and some of them told me they had it to. Some of those people also expressed interest in me. Herpes is only a big deal if you let it be. Get on Antivirals and disclose! I promise you most girls will be impressed that you get tested often and know about your current health statut and what you can do to protect them. If you re on antivirals and actually know that you have herpes they are actually less likely to catch it from you than from any random guys they have sex with as 1 in 6 people have genital herpes and condom aren’t good at protecting girls from it. ( I caught it with a condom from a guy who didn’t know he had it and i didn’t see any symptoms )

Anyway. I just wanna say that it gets better, it really does. Everyone is different, some girls will care some won’t care at all. Don’t be ashamed of your herpes, you can get it even with a condom so what the fuck were you supposed to do to not catch it? The only way to avoid herpes is abstinence. You re just a lovely honest human being who enjoys being physically close to other human beings and therefore caught an extremely common skin condition. Never be ashamed and be proud of yourself for thinking that disclosing is the right thing cus I promise you most people dont and this subreddit is not a good example as most people here are pro disclosure but I have been told by many people that they wouldn’t disclose if they had it.

Best of luck and pm me if you have more questions <3"

Herpes,etwe4pw,t3_cdqea2,1563265667.0, He needs to calm down. Tell him that you don’t know if you have it and that herpes is extremely common 1 in 3 people have it on their mouth and 1 in 6 on their genitals and most people don’t shows symptoms so he might already have it. Tell him that you will inform him when you get your results and until then you won’t tolerate him being disrespectful to you. Are you getting a swab from your sore? Best of luck x
Herpes,etwdwrs,t3_cdtn90,1563265342.0,Yesssss! Ive been fascinated with HSV since I got it even though its been hard on my mental health sometimes. But this sub is incredible and so is our mod. It makes me feel so much better to have access to scientifically proven informations with smart people.
Herpes,etq48vu,t1_etq2ua6,1563072220.0,Hsv2 is 18% of the population. 1 people out of 6 have genital herpes including hsv1 and hsv2
Herpes,etpviin,t1_etpqw25,1563065704.0,That’s ridiculous don’t say that you won’t ever have sex again when this is one of the most common skin condition out there. You just have to disclose and the guy might have it too or dont care. If he does then thats ok thats on him!
Herpes,etomspw,t3_ccq1jd,1563032080.0,"He doesn’t have 2% of getting it - the stats are, female to make transmissions 2% for a whole year of having sex multiple times a week with condom and 1% with condom and antivirals. So when you think about it its comes to less than 0% every single time. But yeah of course theres still a risk if you re unlucky or don’t recognize a mild ob etc. Thing is, realistically, because 1 in 6 people have herpes, every time your potential fwb or one night stand have sex, he has 1 in 6 chances of being exposed to herpes. And because 80% of people with genital herpes don’t know they have it as they show no or mild symptoms, they are way more likely to give it to someone than you are if you re using protection and anti virals.

Anyway thats the way I see it. Herpes shouldn’t stop you from having casual sex if thats what you want."
Herpes,etn7swn,t3_cce7nm,1562979182.0,Not disclosed
Herpes,esqi0xs,t3_c8sd6q,1562202887.0,Get tested of course but yeah it sure looks like herpes.
Herpes,esgvl3l,t3_c7ml2q,1561969177.0,Fuck those guys. You can be thankful for herpes for showing you their true colors. Herpes can be a pain in the ass (literally) but its good for screening people out.
HSVpositive,esguqlo,t3_c7l55k,1561967885.0,Forget the whole “ did he lie about being on anti virals or not” thing. He didn’t disclose at first and pressured you to have sex without protection. He is clearly a selfish person that put his own need first. Herpes is actually a good way to screen people. Doesn’t matter if he lied or not as you will never know but he didn’t think if your health first and now you are resenting him and you even think he might have lied to you. I think that shows that you don’t trust him and if you don’t trust your own boyfriend who the fuck can you trust? Honestly if it was me I would end it. Dont stay with someone that doesn’t respect you just because you both have herpes. You deserve better. Also have you tried upping your dose to 1g of valtrex daily ?

Herpes,erugtm8,t3_c40rdh,1561278989.0,Asking the same! My immune system is pretty bad but I am not willing on stopping drinking coffee or chocolate so I am looking for other ways to boost it!
Herpes,erugsga,t3_c40ubm,1561278933.0,Ive read here that you’re supposed to take it for 5 full days in order for it to work for reducing transmission.  Tbh if you re having an active sex life I would just take it everyday if I were you.
depression,erualgc,t1_erty2q9,1561269689.0,Omg. I feel for you I am so sorry. My worst nightmare is to be pregnant as a childfree person with depression. I just want to say that you have options. Just because you’re pregnant doesn’t mean you have to keep it. Plenty of people would be extremely happy to adopt your baby. Your husband can’t force you to keep a baby if you truly don’t want it. Its your decision. My mother used to be miserable and depressed and told us many times how she “sacrificed” her life for us and honestly as a kid it was traumatizing. The kid didn’t ask to be born so if you dont want it don’t keep it! Its better for both of you. Just take your time to make sure its what you want! Best of luck and I am sooooo sorry I cant imagine how trapped and shitty you feel. Being depressed is already fucking shit.
Herpes,eru84np,t3_c3wzlc,1561266679.0,"You said it yourself! You freaked out!!! For me I think the freakiest thing about it all was getting an unknown STD from someone who told me they were clean. So yeah, please, disclose always. A looooot of people have it so you might end up dating someone that has it too. Otherwise some people will be ok with the risks. Honestly once you educate people and you tell them
How common it is and how you knowing your statut and taking anti viral and wearing protection protect them they’ll realize that they could just as well catch it from anyone that doesn’t know their statut and therefore is not doing anything to protect you. Just please disclose."
depression,ersjc4q,t3_c3pxrr,1561215761.0,I feel this on a deep level yet its the only thing that made laugh in a long time so thank you
Herpes,erscohp,t3_c3pc9l,1561209799.0,"Just a thought : I think part of the reason why people don’t disclose their cold sores, (according to my friends that have them) its that 1 : they dont think/know its contagious when they aren’t any active lesions. 2 :  they dont think/know it can be transmitted to genitals 3 : sometimes they dont even know cold sores are herpes...

I know what you mean about the self inflicted stigma thing. But yeah, now that I know I have a virus I want to avoid giving it to someone else as I sure hell wish I didn’t have it."
Herpes,erpeibh,t1_erpdrub,1561113986.0,Thanks. Glad to know I am not the only one thinking its absurd to call someone cowards if they dont want to date u cus of ur herpes.
Herpes,erpegjh,t1_erpe4p5,1561113919.0,Thank u
Herpes,erpebzr,t1_erp8xhx,1561113752.0,"Thats not really the same. There are not a lot of alternative to taking a car for transportation. Sure you could just walk but its not always practical. As with herpes if someone tells you they have it, you can make your decision to not date them and date someone that doesn’t have it (assuming they got tested for herpes which no one does unless they got symptoms). But yeah it is totally true that you might have more chances of catching if from someone who doesn’t know they have it than from someone that has it and is careful about not spreading it. So yeah like I said, not everyone has the same level fo fears regarding virus and their health. Me by example, my health has always been pretty weak so ive always been super careful (well I could’ve been more careful) by wearing protection and asking people about their std statuts etc because I knew if I caught anything it would affect me more than the average person. I caught HSV2 from someone who told me they were “clean” wearing a condom. And yeah ,i have been having Obs pretty much once/twice a month which is fucking awful and depressing and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I am dating someone who has hsv2 and even then, I have been careful about not giving oral sex until I build my antibodies just because I dont want to catch oral hsv2 as well ( even though yes I know the risk is extremely low ) does that make me a coward? I dont think so. I know my health, and I am terrified of virus and its not fun to have sex when you re worried about catching something. Anyway. Everyone is different but dont call people cowards because they re scared of catching a virus. Its their decision and its ok!"
Herpes,erp6jvf,t3_c36r98,1561102070.0,"I disagree. People that refuse to date someone with herpes are not necessarily cowards. Everyone has dealbreakers (like for me I refuse to date non childfree people) and if herpes is one of them then so be it. Its not a big deal and a lot of people are comfortable dating someone with herpes just not everyone but they dont deserve to be called coward for making their own decision. They re not rejecting the person, they re rejecting the idea of willingly exposing themselves to the virus."
depression,ergl6zq,t3_c1ug9l,1560844880.0,Same! I am sorry!
Herpes,ergl4wx,t3_c1whuj,1560844791.0,"Hey darling, I was diagnosed 4 months ago and I am telling you the first two weeks were probably one of the worse two weeks of my life. I cried non stop and felt like a part of me has died. I promise you it does get better but if you re already in a bad mental health state like I am you should definitely seek out for counseling. I dont know where u live but some sex clinics offers free counseling following a diagnosis. I went to one and it helped tremendously! I got a bit over herpes after 2 months but now that my mental health is weak for different reasons the herpes trauma is coming back so I am gonna start therapy next week. Just remember that herpes is just a skin condition but its totally understandable to be traumatized and cry when you get diagnosed with a lifelong virus especially with the dumb stigma around it. You ll be ok I promise. Be kind to yourself and go seek counseling! xo"
depression,erbzc3q,t3_c19a19,1560698502.0,Awww that made me smile. I am glad you got out of the house. Take care of yourself mate
Herpes,eqlnrgz,t3_bysdp5,1560147353.0,What a cunt. I am sorry! Keep looking you re amazing she doesn’t deserve you.
Herpes,eqiyj3c,t1_eqiqmaq,1560095810.0,Hey! Thank you so much for answering me. I am glad you re doing better and so happy for you that you’re doing better and are in a loving relationship. I wish you the best x
Herpes,eqi261b,t1_eqhr2po,1560076996.0,"I second it. So many people don’t disclose and the fact that you disclosed makes you brave and kind. You’re an amazing person, keep dating, the guy that rejected you is at risk of getting herpes every time he sleeps with someone new anyway - that’s just how common this virus is."
Herpes,eqi1ugr,t3_byihg2,1560076770.0,"Hey! I am so sorry this happened to you. The same thing happened to me. I honestly have a feeling that most of the time, new infections are from careless people that didn’t disclose. I am glad you re ready to have sex again, you have to remember that not everyone care about herpes the way that people that post on those groups are. A lot of people actually dont care but mostly a lot of people also have it. I know exactly what you mean by fearing you might give it to them. I think you could reassure yourself by telling yourself that at least you know your statut and therefore, if you re doing everything right (daily anti virals, condom etc) you re less likely to transmit it than someone that doesn’t know their statut. Herpes is so fucking common so every time someone sleep with someone else they risks getting it. Its not like all other sti where condom protects you. So yeah. Most people here seems to go on at least on date (sometimes more) then disclose with the facts and statistics. If they reject you, they are not rejecting you they are rejecting the risk, just like some people are scared of having the flu and some other dont care, not everyone is comfortable with the same level of risks. Just disclose be honest and if they take the risk you have to believe them that they are comfortable taking it. And remember, every time they sleep with someone new, they are at risk of getting herpes too. Best of luck my dear. remember herpes is sooo common, dont let it destroy your sex life. You re still the same human."
depression,eqhn1cf,t1_eqhlti9,1560064741.0,I feel the same way. I wouldn’t want to fight cancer anyway I would probably just want to die before.
depression,eq22oci,t1_eq1yys4,1559726554.0,Your friend is not good for you if you feel more exhausted then before you spoke to her.  You re not doing well you should be focusing on you and you only. Dont do anything tonight. Go and do something that distract you while those horrible feeling pass. You re worth it

depression,epyf4wp,t3_bwhohd,1559631329.0,Good job! I did the same yesterday and it feels so good! Proud of you
Herpes,epyefjo,t3_bwirzm,1559630319.0,Relax you re not a terrible human. At least you re aware of your statut. Think of all the careless people that sleep around without condom and dont even get tested. The fact that you re feeling guilty is a proof that you re a good person you just made a mistake. You did a shitty thing but you re just human. Just tell him and try to learn from that mistake. You ll be ok <3
Herpes,epye9ge,t1_epwr3ja,1559630083.0,I hiighly suggest daily valtrex. My ob are terrible without it
