JordanPeterson,fr2lygh,t1_fr2kp7q,1589839630.0,"A judge who wrote a paper about how the corona-rules are unconstitutional was kidnapped by the police, was taken into a psychatric unic. She was inprisoned into a room with only a sink. Usually you can't just put people into the psychatry, only if there's immediate dangers for others or the person itself. It's no exception that many people get sent out of a psychatry because the ""danger"" isn't there. But especially in social-media it's very prevelant. But also generally. I got shut up in uni by a professpr for stating how the ""wage-gap"" statistics are not what they seem like. And many more stuff that i see more often then i'd prefer too."
JordanPeterson,fr2l0ru,t1_fr2jn4j,1589839151.0,"yeah i see. Personally i'm like liberal + more right. So basiacly a libertarian.  Liberalism is the classic sense while i value traditions and morality. Because i think they have much symbolic value and are important for the (collective) unconscious. I feel like main-problem nowadays is the raise of narcissism and the lack of awareness. I believe if people were more mindfull a lot of problems would solve themselves. People are so fed-up, neurotic, depressed, anxious... it's quite astounding. This of course shapes our society and politics. I'd argue a mindfull person would never vote for a political ""extreme"". And this extreme hate towards other groups of other opinions/ races/ political preferences would stop or at least decrease. Tribalism is a primal instinct. Not necessary, nowadays. Tribalism functions purely on egoistic gains and that's exactly what our society trains people to be like. Our politics now are only the reactions to former political/ social decisions. Especially in america we have a great example for this, the country is basiacly divided. The sense of a national union/ of companionship is lost."

It all comes from different ""agendas"" planned behind closed doors by a couple of ""experts"". It's a sick neo-liberal world-vision which is clearly utopic in nature. Very dangerous if you ask me.

Those conservatives won - in fact they will win in all of europe because the leftist ideology has invaded everything, even our schools. The people notice that and they vote right. The governments have been purely left since a couple of years. Now this changes and i think it's a very natural and important step into more democracy. It's not democracy when you're only able to vote for left-parties or for basiacly nazis. That's just ridicilous. I will probably vote right soon. Left has ridicouled itself, they are clowns.
