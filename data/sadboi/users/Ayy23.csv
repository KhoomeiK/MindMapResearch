PublicRelations,fohypy1,t3_g7jckj,1587775249.0,"As someone who switched from journalism to PR I would say they both require building relationships and developing an understanding of your audience and what stories are newsworthy or matter to them.

In my experience these “soft” skills are what will help you find a good story or develop good content that goes a long way in making a news story or press outreach successful. It’s hard to write a compelling news story if no sources will talk to you, and it’s hard to promote your client if they aren’t receptive to your ideas.

In terms of other skills it depends where you work. I worked at a newspaper and had to interview, coordinate with writers, write, take video and photos for social, and layout pages. A broadcast journalist would have different experiences and skills. Now I work in-house and am doing interviews and doing research to put together press releases and newsletter articles, using InDesign to develop marketing material, scheduling events, tracking metrics, and writing reports. So in general I would say writing is big and other software tools common in communication.

Objectivity is important in both fields and it goes back to building relationships. Lying is going to damage reputations with an audience, and I think consumers are becoming smarter nowadays with the internet and more channels to get info from."
