If you're embarrassed by an amazing man's background you don't deserve him. If your family and friends can't accept you happy and in love then thats messed up too.

But do you honestly think we do not try to overcome it? Do people with cancer not try to overcome that? 

Fucking hell. Try educating yourself. Agoraphobia is so much more than I don't want to go outside because I'm too lazy and it's comfier at home. Agoraphobia is a result of leaving the house too many times and receiving trauma and things happen that reinforce the need to be safe at home. Agoraphobia means being invited out by friends only to be jumped and attacked and beaten up every single time. Or to be hurled abuse at. Or to get stuck in the middle of the street because your leg disability  plays up and makes you unable to walk or do anything but scream and no one will help, they just, Just stare at you. Agoraphobia  is falling too many times and being laughed at when you're too hurt to get back up. So going outside alone becomes impossible  because its not safe and you need help. Agoraphobia is years and years of therapy and CBT and pushing yourself every day just to do the things you need to do to survive.

Agoraphobia isn't a damn choice. Its an illness. And we all get sick. But it takes time to heal. And not all illnesses have a  cure."

Yes men are a lot more touchy feely than us and don't seem to feel the same exhaustions we do or the responsibility and weight on our shoulders. They just feel horny, and want you. And want it now. And can't help but touch you because they want you. 

And that's great. We all want to be wanted. But just not all the time. And that doesn't mean we can only have sex on our terms. But there has to be some compromise and understanding from both parties about what's realistic and what isn't.

Sex should be fun and enjoyable for both people. It should bring you closer and create happiness and stuff. And if it's not, don't do it. If it fills you with dread and shame and ""oh god please just make it stop"" then you got to make it stop yourself. 

You need to be able to speak to him about how he's making you feel and he needs to take it seriously and you can both talk about ways to be intimate that are less energy and sexual driven. After a long day a nice cuddle, massage, foot rub would be nice. You can give him intimacy in the same ways. 

He can help you to feel sexy in ways without grabbing at you like you're a sex object. Them just saying you're sexy and grabbing you isn't always what it takes to make us feel sexy and in the mood. 

You are not wrong for not wanting it. Even if you did want it all the time you can't possibly do it all the time when you're working long days and just too damn tired.

It is so important to look after your mental health and it's very clear your partner isn't. 

Whatever your issues as a couple, it's hard to say who is wrong or right. There's always two sides of a story. And sometimes two people just aren't compatible. Some people expect chores to be done daily and things kept perfectly in order, but other people only do chores when they have to because it's stopping them from being able to do what they want, ie eat food or wear clothes. 

It doesn't mean either of you are bad people. You're clearly both fed up of each other right now and would benefit from time apart or quality time together.

relationship_advice,fme1pdx,t1_fme1407,1585985754.0,"Excuse me. But I wasn't. She said she wasn't sure if it classes as sexual assault or not. I simply agreed that I don't know if it's sexual assault or not. If she feels she was assaulted then yes it is assault. Get off your damn high horse. 

My point was simply you know you're being raped when you say no and they continue. How do I know this? I was raped. But you don't always know if it's sexual assault. There's many different categories for sexual assault and abuse. 

If you tell a guy no, he definitely knows he's raping you. You said no. He carried on. End of. If you have sex willingly with a guy who thinks you want to have sex with him because you don't say nothing, you don't act like you don't want it, you go along with it to please him. How is he to know he's assaulting you? It just looks like bad sex to him unless you're faking orgasms to hurry it along then it looks like good sex and he's none the wiser.

I was also sexually abused for many years. And there's a thin line between having sex with someone because you can't be arsed to say no. Or having sex with someone because you're too afraid to say no due to possibility of them attacking/raping you. But the worst thing we can ever do is pretend we like it to hurry it along. 

If you don't want sex with someone, don't have sex. Make it clear you don't want sex. That way if they continue you know for sure you said no, you know for sure it's assault. It's rape. 

Otherwise it's impossible to take the case to court because he thought ""he was having a damn good shag with a willing bird""."
relationship_advice,fmdz30p,t1_fmdz0iq,1585982889.0,So this sounds more like insecurity or jealousy. It's more he can't stand the thought of someone else being with you. Rather than some guy may have hurt you. If it was the latter he'd just love you in a way that makes you forget all that. But he can't forget the fact you did have sex with someone else.
DMAcademy,fmdz0et,t1_fmdyvh6,1585982810.0,"As for encouraging socialising. Use the discord server and just chat. Set up seperate chats in there for the game, general, hobbies or interests etc. Give people a place to talk about things that aren't just game related and they may just do so. 

I'm only in one discord group and it's supposed to be an Agoraphobia support discord. But no one talks much about our mental health. We talk about movies, Hobbies, our life's, our pets and even gaming. Because there are areas for us to do so"
DMAcademy,fmdyvh6,t3_fuosbq,1585982666.0,"Groups won't always form a bond. If they aren't also looking to. If you keep adding people eventually you'll get a bunch of people who keep doing the one shots and like to chat and banter off each other. 

Personally I'd love to make friends and have a group and whatnot but I'm always the outsider."
self,fmdyn23,t3_fuou76,1585982426.0,There ain't no one finding a damn job right now silly. There's an epidemic. But if you do want a job there's a lot of supermarkets and places like that desperate for staff because everyone they do have keeps getting sick and they need to keep feeding the world

Anxiety,fmdy8d7,t3_fuobux,1585982008.0,"I'm not sure which feeds are showing up the Coronavirus things in your feed, but maybe you simply need to leave those communities for now and stay in the ones that are easier for your mental health so you're not seeing stuff you don't want to see"
depression,fmdy5gr,t1_fmdxyk0,1585981925.0,"You didn't move on if you know they're still waiting for you. And If they are after you treating them like that for 3 months. Well. I don't know.

Just tell them you want no further contact, block them on any thing. And then this time move on.

Moving on means not sitting around making sure someone's waiting for you and game playing. It means getting on with your life. Moving forward."
depression,fmdxwl4,t1_fmdxtzm,1585981669.0,Then simply cut them out of your life and move on yourself.
depression,fmdxdym,t3_fuoecd,1585981137.0,"Whether someone moves on or not, is generally their choice. You can cut them off completely. But if they want to be there for you they will. 

It's easy to feel like a burden when you're mentally ill. We put a lot of pressure on those around us. 

Sometimes people aren't able to forget about you, they may even want to help you when you're struggling. Others may get irritated and leave on their own accord.

But don't push people away who are actually wanting to help and support you. By the sounds of it you need some support right now if you truly want to die"
Anxiety,fmdx830,t3_fuoerz,1585980974.0,"It's pretty normal for a bad situation to spark up those past issues. It happens to me a lot. As much as you want to help your friend, it's okay for you to have to deal with this. You can't take care of someone else until you've taken care of yourself. (Everyone told me that when I was a mum to a newborn neglecting myself, but it's true) 

Try to focus on you and get through this. Once you're out the other side you will be there for your friend and vice versa. 

Let your friend know what you're going through, without making it sound like point scoring because no one's worse off than the other. You may find you're able to support and understand each other then if she knows that you're struggling."
depression,fmdwxwy,t3_fuoext,1585980693.0,"The mental health support lines are so so busy right now due to the epidemic across the world. A lot of people are suffering with this right now. I stopped emailing Samaritans. The wait for a reply was getting so long. 

But you definitely do exist!

As for video games. I have no idea what platform you use or genre you like, but I love to game too. 

Feel better soon!"
