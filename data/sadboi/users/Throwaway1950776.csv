Once I screen a prospect, I then show them the unit in person. If they want to proceed, I get their email. 

Once I have their email I set it up on the landlord MySmartMove.com website. Once you sign up, all you need to do is setup the property and enter their email in the app box.

It runs a background and credit check. Also get pay stubs electronically. From there you can decide.

My other friends, we all see it, we acknowledge it amongst ourselves he‚Äôs always just been like that. There‚Äôs an emotional gap there somewhere. He did suffer from what I would call a horrible tragedy as a child. However, we don‚Äôt bring it up, he doesn‚Äôt talk about it. 

There‚Äôs just a gap in him. You can‚Äôt penetrate him, you can‚Äôt get close to him, he‚Äôs a steel wall."
NordicSkinCare,fciq5ym,t1_faadpdi,1577667183.0,"I‚Äôm not sure you need sunscreen in Norway, you guys are near the top of the world.

I‚Äôm from the southern United States, we have many beaches here, semi-tropical climate. 

Many people wear sunscreen but will still tan. Its very popular among women. 

Because of this, we have a plethora of 40 year old women with the skin of a 60 year old. It significantly damages the skin. 

I don‚Äôt wear sunscreen, but rarely do I sit outside without an umbrella or shade. If I‚Äôm exercising then I generally wear a hat which covers the face.

Tanning (aging) your skin is foolish."

Alabama has only once lost more than two regular season games in the past DECADE !!!

Alabama is 10-2 this season. 

We lost two games this year by a COMBINED 8 POINTS. 

This is typical fans being reactionary fans. This guy put us back on the map after 25 years of darkness. Stallings was great but we were far from dominant in the 90s.

Most of the revitalization downtown was happening long before he took office. 

We have thousands of plots of empty land and warehouses in the city and what is he doing to attract business to those areas?
