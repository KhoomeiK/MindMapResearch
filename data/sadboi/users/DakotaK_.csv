I am 19 (Prob 20 when I actual plan to get a bike), 

Canada,

Male. 

Budget 5k (Hopefully including gear, but not necessarily)

Height: 5'9""

I like cruiser bikes and want a decent enough engine that I don't grow out of it too fast (Hopefully get a couple of years out of it and even possible use it to commute a bit if insurance allowed), But I also don't want it to be too big that insurance costs too much to even ride it as I am a young male.

I plan to take a riding course (for insurance reasons), so while I don't have any experience hopefully that makes it easier for me to start on slightly bigger bikes then generally recommended

I have been looking at HD Streets and Honda Rebels, but I can't find much for used cruisers in the smaller engine sizes. Would prefer to buy used, and am fine with anything that looks decently cool.

I have family that ride as well.

Also you don't need high grade masks unless you are working with people who are know to be sick for long periods of time. (Health Professional)


Masks don't protect you, they protect others. Also gloves are unnecessary if you are only going grocery shopping, washing your hands after if enough.


Also washing your hands with warm water is more effective then sanatizer.

Sanatizer: Kills basic germs in less than 30 seconds, not graded for virus though can be helpful.

Disinfectant: Kills germs and viruses in less than 10 minutes (needs to sit for 10 minutes)

Sterilization: Complete kills all biological matter/living things.
