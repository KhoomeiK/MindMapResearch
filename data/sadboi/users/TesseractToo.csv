Things wouldn't have gotten so bad if my mom hadn't meddled the way she does, that was really the key as I understand it now.

BreadTube,fqvnqib,t3_gkye58,1589681168.0,"This made me think of something that has always poked at the corner of my psyche when i see it but I have never been able to put into words before, and that is corporate versions of Aboriginal art. You see this a lot in Australia but also places where the native art style agrees with the sensibilities, like Navajo patterns in things around Arizona and Pacific Northwest (North American) and or course the many art styles around Africa and... you get the jist.  


Now I'm not an expert on this so I hope I don't say things that are too cringy, and my intent is not to put down anyone.  


But it feels like the corporate people are trying to take the aesthetic of the art and dilute it's meaning to make it meaningless and purely decorative and just leaving the pattern. Australia aboriginal art is usually a map, to to get to food or water or shelter (as I understand it, again, not an expert so apologies if I'm wrong please feel free to correct me) but the stuff you see plastered on the walls or banks and hotels I'm sure isn't meaningful at all.  


That being said, of course these artists deserve to follow their own path as artisans and make money and they are smart enough to separate a commission from a corporation from doing really traditional works but for me when I see stuff like that it gives me an uncanny valley feeling like an apple in clamshell packaging, like something went wrong along the way.  


I need to think about this more that I've identified the feeling, but I thought I'd jot it down before I forgot about it and see what others think in this context."

CPTSD,fqvlt6w,t1_fqvh750,1589680003.0,"Well I didn't have a support network and she didn't make me move, it was a joint decision and it seemed better that I move there rather than she move here. She wasn't mean until after I sold my house and moved and her behavior took a turn which is really baffling as for the previous 7 years she was lovely and extremely supportive. So those red flags you are pointing out weren't there for the first 7 years, they were only problems when they became problems. I understand how you can look at a post in which these things have been selectively posted and see the signs that were put there and draw conclusions based on never having seen the whole story but I wasn't a naive person walking into the trap of a predator, I knew signs of abuse, it was more like she has unaddressed issues and started scapegoating me and i didn't know what to do because we were in a temporary state of me living at her place till we got our own (which never happened). 

On hindsight and after some research I think it was a case of someone with Borderline personality switching ""off"" away from favorite person, that thing they do and I didn't know to see it at the start. I think her psychologist may have missed the signs of Borderline as they would have been somewhat disguised by gender dysphoria and I have been considering writing to the psychologist about how she encouraged domestic abuse in her quest to be supportive of the transition.

I'm not going to say it wasn't terrifying and being pushed out of someone life while having to share space in a bachelor apartment wasn't horrible, but it wasn't like what you are painting either. There were no signs of it for many years. I think she is going to to this to a few partners before self-reflecting. I encouraged her to date other people before I moved so she could have more of an understanding on what emotions are like in that context but in the 7 years of distance during the times we were apart she said she tried and hated it and I wasn't going to push her to do something she hated. I'd been in abuse before (having CPTSD of course causes a pattern of poor boundaries causing abuse to happen) and was excersizing utmost caution and trying to set careful boundaries.

All my life I've wanted equal partnership and when I got there she switched from that to suddenly acting like I should be a maid and behaving super childishly including massive toddler tantrums where she would smash my things (while claiming they were hers- like I said very childish). 

This wasn't a predatory type abuse it was really strange and hard to explain."

I'm not going to lie it was very hard, and I was vary annoyed she waited that long toe tell me because she knew I was an ally and had had many trans friends who I have supported over the years. I tried to be there as best as I could and even bought her makeup and nylons and dresses because she was too shy to buy them herself we ended up with a code of her saying ""I think this would look good on you"" with feminine clothes and I knew to buy it in her size.  


At first I took her moodiness as gender dysphoria but she just became meaner and meaner, like she metamorphosed from a really sweet person into a mean girl. She was always pressing me to dress more effeminate and while i don't mind the occasional dress or flowy skirt, she kept with the pressure and wanted me to wear heels a lot (I have a weak ankle from an old break and a bad back and hip so high heels are not something I can do anymore) and I compromised on about 1 1/2 inches on special occasions but she wanted me wearing tall stilettoes along the lines of ""stripper shoes"" which I don't want any part with (I guess it would make sense to mention that my ankle was broken in 2 places FROM wearing high heels and the going sideways on me).   


Anyway I've never been that comfortable with supuer girly shit, these days I'd probably be labelled as genderqueer, not that I like masculine stuff but I'm very middle-of-the-road in gender expression and I'm not personally comfortable with extremes on either side. I don't have a problem with someone else if they want that though. But being pressured towards the effeminate extreme definitely triggered anxiety in myself.  


Anyway it got worse and worse and there was nothing I could do she just became awful and since I'd sold my house to move with her after she proposed I put up with the abuse much longer than I would have if I'd had anywhere to go and knew people in the area. I couldn't go back home though.

However they also partially get stored in the fat so that is one of the reasons that Dr Now had to be hard on him as rapid weight loss could have caused an overdose if he was still taking the pain meds  


I don't think his dad is doing bad stuff intentionally I think he just has really broken boundaries and it trying to do his best in the fucked up situation, to me he seems really anxious and kind of co-dependent and has been running himself ragged for his family a decades"

Part of my childhood involved going to school in a very religious part of the US and we were taught that sharks are smooth one way but if you pet them backwards against the grain of their scales your hands would be cut up similar to a razor sharp cheese grater

We also learned about the Firmament that the stars hang from and Luminiferous aether that separates the plane Earth from the heavens above, so it was solid source material

I am now convinced all sharks are perfectly smooth from all angles and that is how they slip through rough water"
