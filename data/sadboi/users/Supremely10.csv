depression,ez8ezdz,t1_ez8eqf6,1567741477.0,"The first part he's correct, the second one thou I feel like he's a bit misguided and uninformed because many people don't actually know that depression is not just a state of mind that gets you when something goes wrong, is not the same as feeling sad, hell you could be a fcking billionaire, have a perfect life full of loving friends and family and still be depressed to the ground"
depression,ez8eqf6,t1_ez8e7f7,1567741270.0,"Yes, I guess it depends on how u think about it, but what I'm trying to say with ""he has a point"" is that he's not interely incorrect, I guess I should have said it more crearly (I'm not an native English speaker) but of course going out with friends is a cure for feeling sad maybe, not for the actual illness that is depression"
depression,ez8ds77,t1_ez8cuoe,1567740554.0,"If you read everything carefully and think about I hope u will understand my words, because I don't think u get over depression ALONE so yes you need human interaction, u need help from others, u need help from people who know how to deal with this stuff, and so u need to interact with people in order to get better, so if u read carefully, yes he has a point, but it's just not that simple, as I said"
depression,ez6813x,t1_ez5wwoh,1567709787.0,"This is why I don't have any friends, I really don't mind helping anyone who asks me for help, be it friend, family or a complete stranger that I will never hear from again but I in the past when ever I felt I needed help my friends would either change subject, pretend they were busy, try to laugh it out of me or anything tbh, I just feel like the ppl at this point just want to have fun and as soon as someone comes and tells them something sad they run, or they don't want to listen or they don't care anyways, so ye thats why only ppl that went trough shit like you have will be able to hear you, or really kind people but those are actually pretty hard to find"
depression,ez66ett,t3_d006jl,1567709368.0,"Also guys remember when your so deepshit into the ground that's the best place, because from that point, you can only go up, at least that's how I see it"
depression,ez659zh,t3_d006jl,1567709131.0,"Listen man life is hard, I am 21 years old rn, I don't work I life off my mother and my stepdad and I feel like a fucking weight been carried by them, I have no friends, and I rarely even leave home, but since I join this group, I've been reading all the positives comments and I've decided that just been depressed and alone and doing nothing about its not ever gonna work, theres not gonna be one person that comes, knocks on your door with all the answers, so I decided to say fck this shit, now I ve been going for walks, exercising, looking for jobs, and even thou I am still alone I don't even feel like I wanna die every day when I wake up. I guess what I'm trying to say get out there, focus more on the positive things in live, try to see what actually makes you happy, if u don't want to be alone search for a group that has something to do with you and that you feel comfortable with. Just to let you know I also feel like a waste of space ever since I was 4 when I learned that my father abandoned me before I was born and wanted nothing to do with me, when my mother left me with my grandparents to go to another country searching for a better life, and now I'm 21 almost 22 and looking back I feel like I did everything wrong, but trust me, it's never too late to try. Hope this helps you."
depression,ez61y4f,t3_czy6ax,1567708196.0,"Well it's actually not that bad, other people feel depressed no matter what, I feel like it's nice to be able to feel happy/not depressed when your busy, I am the same for the most of it, when I start feeling lonely/depressed I go for walks,  exercise, or whatch movies / series."
depression,ez619sy,t1_ez57sp1,1567707933.0,"Yes, I do the same when I rly like someone and I feel like they start liking me back, I'm like oh no no I can't take this"
depression,ez581v3,t1_ez55new,1567696759.0,"Ye, I get what you mean, I just think ""this is me I guess"" and try to live with it"
depression,ez562lf,t1_ez22daf,1567696124.0,"I kind of thougt the same, nevertheless I still took my time reading it, but why would someone do that xD what do they win with it, I don't know but I think it's better to focus on the positive side of things, even if it was a fake post it's nice to see people in a community try to help each other for a change instead of anything else..."
depression,ez53l1f,t1_ez417h5,1567695606.0,"I mean he has a point I think, because you know if we shut down while been depressed and deal with it alone, it will probably only get worse, but on the other hand, it's just not that simple as interact with people and your depression will go away, so I don't know"
depression,ez535mc,t1_ez36uq4,1567695447.0,"I totally agree with this, being around people is so damn exhausting"
depression,ez52ydt,t3_czupd3,1567695374.0,I wish things would be that simple uh
depression,ez52goh,t1_ez4zmgf,1567695186.0,"Yup, 5 relationship none more than 1 month"
depression,ez4zx0e,t3_czz7av,1567694582.0,"Man this is so me, from time to time I feel very lonely and I look outside people going out and having fun and well I whish I could do that, but when I go out with friends after 2 or 3 times I just think to myself fck this shit, even if I have fun and then proceed to isolate my self for a year or so"
depression,eyw1krs,t1_eyw0yb4,1567518464.0,I stopped at 15 because I didn't pass the medical exams (idk how it's called in English) I guess at that point I was chad (had to search chad too...) since everything was perfect compared to what it is now...
