MedicalGore,fpcikxr,t1_fpcdwfe,1588501868.0,"Your wound failed to heal through primary intention. There was an issue in the proliferation stage of healing where angiogenesis occurs, essentially blood flow was compromised causing necrosis. 

Patient movement is also a big reason for complications, pulling and moving against sutures. 

Suture ligatures being too tight are also a potential for epidermal damage. They looked fine from what I can see. 

Sometimes these things happen and there’s no one to blame. The body can be so resilient at times but fail at something simple."
MedicalGore,fpc8mal,t1_fpbdivs,1588491358.0,"I find it hard to believe that it was negligence on the Doctors part. 

I’ve assisted with cesarean sections where we stretch incisions to at least double and also blunt dissected incisions frequently. 

There’s minor bruising, sutures look fine with several anchor sutures for stability. Sutures should have stayed for 14 days minimum with supportive dressings to prevent dehiscence (which is what happened). 

From there chronic wound management with wet dressings, packing and anti microbial agents like silver and antibiotics post wound swabs.

I’ve honestly never seen excessive stretching. I’m glad it’s healed, shame that it was so traumatic."

Wellthatsucks,fg8iuce,t3_ex3u45,1580620845.0,"Story time,

I graduated from University in late 2018 and started a Graduate Year as an RN in early 2019 which is kinda like a 12 month apprenticeship program. 

So unfortunately I suffer from treatment resistant depression which I had been managing marginally over the last 3 years with a crap tonne of medication and other physical therapies. 

About 3 months into the program I couldn’t manage my depression anymore and was suicidal, I went into hospital to work on myself. I ended up not responding to most treatments and required Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). I pretty much remember nothing from the time I was in hospital but I know it was the worst time of my life. 

I slowly got back my ability to recall short term memory and came back to work after being away  from early April ‘19 to late June ‘19. So about three months. I went back to work and you wouldn’t have noticed the internal struggles I’ve been facing. 

So I finished up the ‘apprenticeship’ on January 31st and was given this certificate. I’m not sure how I could have partially completed a graduate year and get a certificate of completion. 

It’s kinda funny but equally sad that my workplace couldn’t overlook what happened, this isn’t even a certificate for university studies but an in-house award. An appreciation award. 

I can’t hang this because every time I’ll look at I’ll be reminded that I couldn’t complete something because of my illness."

We have incredibly strict gun laws and only a small percentage have them.
