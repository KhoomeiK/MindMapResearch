Thinking like this is an endless fountain of misery. I'll tell you how I learned to avoid it a long time ago. I create what you might call an operating presumption, which is: Everyone loves me, and wishes me well. I then treat literally everyone accordingly. The fact that it's not true that everyone loves me and wishes me well doesn't matter. What matters is that by treating people as if they do, you end up creating that reality more often than not. The second benefit is that you get to stop wasting time and energy speculating on the feelings of others when it comes to yourself."

This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case may be.
