I relate to some histrionic traits, sometimes narcissistic, and sometimes npd.

At one point I was sure I had multiple personalities, but it's more that my personality is just very fluid. I do have this devil or evil 'persona', which is more me supressing my rage and other negative aspects of myself. I do feel as if I'm npd at times, but that too is just one of the states of mind. Also might be the depression idk. I'm only 20 so I'm still developing my personality, so who knows what I'll become. 

I was avoidant for a good few years in my teens, so I pretty much fell behind in socializing. I'm now catching up in a sense and forming parts of me that others have done long ago.
I just feel weird tbh. Not really sure how I want to be perceived. I like attention, but I'm also cautious not to become a dick. At the same time a part of me really wants to become a dick. So many different people in the world, I need a personality to handle any and all of them. Or maybe I don't. 

Honestly the worst part is the black and white thinking, really messes with my opinions. I'm just experimenting rn with people, seeing what works and what doesn't.

And support each other by knowing we're there for each other.

I don't know your relationship dynamics, and this is just my own vision of what I'd like to have some day. But maybe you do feel the need for affection a little too much. That's not to say it's your fault or you shouldn't have those needs. 

I personally like autonomous women, and women like autonomous men. For the most part. Instead of feeling like you need something from him, try filling your own needs yourself.

Or maybe just doing LSD on my own, instead of with people around, so I didn't have distractions. Don't really remember, smoked weed heavily for 1.5 years as well. It helped fill the empty, better than anything else I feel like.

The first few times I did LSD I felt better afterwards, felt love for people I had never felt before. Acceptance of others. That eventually grew into acceptance of myself.

From this list I think that recognizing my emotions has been the biggest help. There's something so freeing about simply knowing what I feel. I've practised some kind of mindfullness, not anything specific, but I read about it and have tried to do something of that kind. Haven't used any of the methods specifically but a mix of things I've read. It's really hard for me, and for everyone I feel like, which is why people don't like it. 
Also recently have started expressing myself more. In general and also about what I think and want. Surprisingly difficult to say what I think most of the times. Also because I don't hold many fixed opinions. Everything is in the details, when it comes to my opinions, have to know every side of things.

I think I might be getting into some sort of therapy soon though, as I changed medical facilities and for the first time filled in some personality tests. My scales were all over the place and all borderline traits had a circle around them. My psychologist said I'm a young person so that might affect it. We haven't had a conversation yet, just the tests. A previous psychologist said the same thing when I told her about bpd. So frustrating. I think they don't want to diagnose me a personality disorder since it's supposed to feel bad or something. But honestly I'd rather get proper treatment than have it sugarcoated for no reason. One reason might be that we don't have any proper therapists for personality disorders in my country. I live in Estonia, small country, not so good mental health awareness. Only been independent for a few decades, not many trained professionals when it comes to more serious mental health issues. A lot of normal chatting psychologists though :))"

I guess I was idolizing her and devalueing all my other friends. But as we were seperate for a while I learnt not to care about it. I mean they can be dumb but they're still my friends. They'd help me out if I was in need and that's more improtant I think. Definitely a tough situation but just learn to look past it. You don't have to engage in it yourself.

Burnout is common in psychologists that do care so it's difficult for them, but yeah, still really annoying. This emotional stupidity makes me doubt they could even help me with my emotions, thus why I've been trying to work through my issues on my own, not a perfect solution. 

I'm so sorry you were hurt in this manner, definitely shouldn't have happened. I guess what would help in the future is being very open from the start, like when you feel you're getting attached, say that and also what that means for you.

People aren't in tune with their emotions mostly. Everybody has layers of protection, that change the way we think and act.

As I'm sure I will be (and am) about my own. 

Schools are definitely something I've thought about a lot. Even considered teaching, maybe I will at some point in my life. Haven't actually thought about prisons. But you're right, there's so much to be done there. I've mainly been thinking about upbringing and such. Since I have a 6 year old sister that means the world to me. And seeing her insecurities and fears, it breaks my heart. There should be proper support coming from kindergarten and schools. It's actually been one of my dreams or possible avenues to make a system, that teaches teachers about emotions and child psychology. Since a true 'revolution' in society can only happen when there are people emotionally intelligence enough to understand each other.

I'm in the army right now, mandatory conscription. And it has really helped me get rid of my laziness, which stemmed from low self-esteem and depression. I've become so much bolder and open as well, thanks to opening up to some friends. I never believed that possible before. I was expecting to never contact them again after school. I'm now beginning to voice my opinion and doing things I believe I should, not being kept back by my fears and self doubt.

Since I knew I couldn't express myself properly in person, I started writing. Idk if it's dissociation or what, but I've been unable to do it in person. Now I finally feel as if I'm capable. Thus why I'm so eager for the appointment. 

But yeah, I made a google doc when I felt heavily distressed emotionally. Reading it today, for me, it perfectly shows how I was going through an almost psychotic emotional episode. And then calming myself down, dissociating from my emotions. But my psychologist didn't even bring it up at our appointment, like wtf. I didn't either, since I had basically forgotten it happened. Or at least the emotions associated with it. The mental health people in my country are outdated and just bad. I'm really angry about it. I just feel if I don't give them a lead they won't understand shit. 

But yes. Instead of telling them the diagnosis, I should for once actually describe my symptoms directly. Not hoping they are able to get them out of me by talking.

But for me it's more that I have tried to get help from mental health proffessionals. But the ones I've been to don't even deal with emotsion I feel like. They just ask shallow questions. It's partly my 'fault' as well, since I don't show others my emotions. Been withdrawn all my life, always trying to smile on the outside. I can be very eccentric, even when I'm feeling terrible. 

So yes. Instead of getting help from proffessionals. I'm gonna help them see what's wrong with me first, so they can help me. I'm confident I'm smart enough to understand large parts of my being. And seeing at least partly what my problems are.

I'm very self-conscious, so I know I'm fucked up. I don't lie to myself, waiting someone else to tell me I'm fucked up. Since I don't show that to them. That's been the main thing I've been trying to improve. Showing."
BPD,fehnzqx,t1_fehma8e,1579120408.0,"Hmm, reading that link I don't really identify with the quiet bpd. That's a really different description than what I had read. I'd say impulsive would describe me best from that list and parts of petulant. Sometimes I have self-destructive traits as well. Mostly the unconscious desires part. I feel I am largely controlled by unconscious parts of my brain. Or rather I have made them unconscious so I can cope with them somehow. Been trying to work on that a lot, trying to be mindful - realizing what it is that I actually want.

I agree, there aren't real subtypes, they're just used to describe different types of people. But I guess it REALLY depends on the person doing the describing. I've only read the eggshellstherapy quiet bpd one, and a lot of that felt true for me. 

Mostly the following, just copying the headlines from the article. 1. SELF- BLAME. 2. YOU ARE CALM ON THE OUTSIDE BUT SUFFERS ON INSIDE. 3. YOU APPEAR TO BE ‘HIGH FUNCTIONING’. 4. YOU SOCIALLY WITHDRAW. 5. YOU MENTALLY RETREAT OR DISSOCIATE. 7. YOU FEAR BOTH ABANDONMENT AND INTIMACY. 

The others fit as well, but seem more general. The descriptions bring out the more specific parts, although I don't completely agree with all of them."
BPD,fehlg7x,t1_fehkti0,1579118939.0,"Oh. There are subtypes to bpd. Basically different ways people have developed and how they manage their symptoms.

news,fdjex5g,t1_fdjak1e,1578467927.0,"So your viewpoint is from your own church. How do you view the 'catholic church'. I'm not sure how centralized catholics are, in terms of individual churches around the world. But there are many corrupt catholic (and other) institutions. That avoid taxes, use money gained from donations for their own ends, hide criminal activity (ie child rape) of their members. 
I see your point, someone who confesses, is probably going to try to better themselves, maybe even turn themselves in. But what about some of the crazy fuckers, who are certain of themselves being children of god. All the while being complete assholes and beating their own children. Those people exist. 
And as someone said, a priest can protect themselves and their friend in court, by having the right not to tell the truth. Because their friend 'confessed' to them. 
Since I take your point is that people wouldn't confess, if it weren't confidential. And not about going against the outdated rules of the catholic church. What if the law was something like this. If the crime is serious enough and it seems it is likely to happen again, or it HAS happened repeatedly during confessions, he has to report it. Also, definitely (100%) priests should have to testify in court, if the case has been made with information outside of confessions. Ie the priest is just a witness, not the one to report the crime. There is no way in hell the rules of a religion should overrule the rules of law. I would like your input on this."
BPD,fdi8q2z,t1_fdi1lau,1578437754.0,"So I've read through this thread. As I understand you are going through shit rn, with not being able to afford the therapy you want. But I believe that's one of the symptoms, the all or nothing atttitude. Yes, maybe the higher cost one is better. But more important than cost is the therapist. And more expensive doesn't equate to better quality. In my country health care covers basically the whole therapy. Ofc waiting times are longer for it, since we don't have many therapists either. So for me it,'s basically a coin toss, whether I get a good therapist or not. Money doesn't dictate the quality, necessarily. I'm sure there are people out there that work for lower sums, since they want to help people. Ofc with overloaded healthcare system things get more complicated.

I would say I have a better handle on my emotions than you. Since my primary coping mechanism is blocking emotion. Honestly from your first reply I felt really attacked. I thought about attacking you back, as some people here did. Since you are very agressive. It's natural. But I kept myself from doing so. From your comments I would expect you to now devalue my suffering, saying if I can manage my agression, then I can't have bpd. But that really isn't the case. 

Since you are very emotionally charged and under stress rn. You are explosive. And you can only see the bad and you see it worse than it 'actually' is. You have had better times, right? Felt more in control, less agressive. At least a little  right? Yes, you are like this most of the time. Doesn't mean you are a worthless piece of shit with the only intention and ability to cause suffering and pain. Deep down you are beautiful, you don't want to believe that, you can't rn. But it's there, 'all' you have to do is see it and believe it. As you are older, 37, your mind has hardened more so than younger people with bpd. It is easier for them to change, than it is for you. So this is why you might feel like they aren't true bpd.

Yes, you have it fucking terrible. And apparently do some people that you have talked to. But that feels like an echo chamber to me. Comparing whos got it worse and making it into a sick and painful competition. Doesn't mean everyone who has it easier don't have what you have. We are all unique people, our minds interpret things differently, react differently. Even though you act like an asshole, I still love you. I love all people that suffer. You are beautiful to me by feeling suffering. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. You are beautiful, learn to believe it."
BPD,fdi34en,t1_fdi1lau,1578434878.0,"My dad died when I was 4. I have 2 memories of him. One where he was teaching me how to ride a bike. The other of him spanking me and yelling at me to apologize to my older sister. Since I had hit her in retaliation after she had hit me. 

My mom was emotionally very distant. She never talks about how she feels. Although at times she showed that she loves me by being gentle. She would get irritated constantly, due to her stress, thus yelling a lot. She would get really angry, like clenching her teeth and calling me bad words. She would often apologize later, specially if she hurt me physically. She never hurt me bad, as in, the pain would be over in a few minutes. So yeah, anger issues there. Her father had a short fuse as well, so that's most likely where she got that from. I feel so bad for her. I can't even feel bad for myself as I'm writing this. I'm very distant from my deep emotions.

Whenever she hurt me physically, would trigger a lot of emotional pain. I mean, it was just different. Maybe because of the way she reacted as well, instantly feeling sorry. Except for when I got older and she didn't even do that.

Edit: that last sentence made me tear up instantly, reliving a situation. Yeah I really need therapy to go through my childhood. Do they do that in DBT?"
BPD,fdi18r1,t1_fdhyict,1578433944.0,"Got a 29 out of 42. 31+ is likely autism. I've considered this before. But like I'm not fully autistic, maybe on the spectrum. 

Or maybe I just didn't get to learn socializing properly as a kid. Since I was so fucked up already emotionally. Since I think autism means you can't completely comprehend emotions? Maybe that's just something false I've read. 

I just contribute the wrong feelings onto people. But almost only when those feelings are related to me. I'm pretty good at understanding how people relate to other things and situations. Going to a new psychiatrist soon. I know they have DBT therapist in the facility. Hopefully going to get an appointment. DBT is definitely the only form of therapy I'm interested in. 

I really should do some homework on it, read various resources etc, just too lazy or scared or something. I have trouble identifying my own emotions. Might be the coping mechanisms from having no one to share my emotions with when I was a child.

Really looking forward to that appointment now. Since I also have trouble communicating with psychs, ie expressing myself in an understandable way. Trying to figure out how I am, so I can be understood properly."

Then when I felt completely alone, I messaged her, confessed my feelings that I wasn't even sure I have. Basically just wanted attention, and tried to use her for it. Got rejected, but softly, since my social skills are garbage. Then went on to be friendly again, mainly just snapping. Then sent some stupid shit again. I'm just sending so many mixed signals. Keep going back to the baseline feeling of just being friends, like nothing has happened. She acts kinda weird too, probably confused af. I should just stop. But I 'can't'.

Not faking, but that they're not real. Self-blame I think is the emotion I felt. Mental health professionals really aren't that great tbf, like from a quality standpoint. They're pretty distant from what it actually feels like to have these mental problems. Psychology relies too much on superficial patterns. It should focus more on emotions.

It definently feels belittling, like it's not a real problem then. But keep in mind she also has a limited understanding of bpd and human psychology in general. Ofc I don't know the whole situation. But I think she said that to try to comfort you. I know and you know it has the opposite effect, but she doesn't know that. 

I have the same thing with my current psychologist. She isn't the most empathic person. She says things for reasons completely foreign to me. I'm pretty sure she sees them as logical. That those words would comfort me in some way. Instead they make me doubt her sincerity. I'm actually thinking of not making a new appointment. Because I can't trust she cares about me. Humans are limited, I know she's supposed to be a professional, but they don't often times know everything/much either.

As to actual plans of suicide. I'd remove the methods of which you plan to use. In this case discard or make the benzos unavailable. If that's the 'preferred' method for you, try to exclude it from being realistic. Ofc that doesn't exclude other ways, but maybe those aren't as likeable. 

If the thoughts get very intense, go to someone's place. Family, friends, if not those then hell (not to hell bad wording lol) go to anywhere with people. Where ever you feel the least bit comfortable and where you couldn't do it. 

Don't think the thoughts alone. Just going to overthink and spin it around in your head. Maybe try making your mind empty, just ignore the thoughts for a second. Meditation and mindfullness type stuff. If you feel exhausted, try lying down and maybe youll fall asleep. Maybe cry, really cry. Feel sorry for yourself, really feel it deep inside, how you are suffering. But feel it, don't think. Thinking has the danger of turning to overthinking. Feel whatever emotions come out and cry I mean really just raw crying. It usually resets me in a sense. Makes me numb or something. After, that's usually when I feel exhausted and fall asleep. Waking up I feel a little calmer.

Depending on your interests. Try making yourself do some sports, even if you dont really. Exercise is truly great, for me anyways. Go for a run, push yourself, youll feel good after its done, dont give up, dont make it easy.

If you want to talk to me about anything you can do that. Or find someone else that you can make yourself trust enough. I dont know what sort of issues you have. If they're related to other people. As mine are, I have decided to limit my investment into other people. Try to be alone and as independent as possible.

You can get yourself through this. It always feels like the current emotional state is the only thing that exists. But it is definently not the case. Better feelings will come. If not, then make them. Don't feel weak, you're super strong if you need and want to be."
