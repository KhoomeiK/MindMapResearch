NonBinaryTalk,fkkqjvm,t3_fj2bc5,1584289839.0,"So, some mammary tissue is preserved with top surgery.
This means you’ll be able to produce milk.
(Maybe not enough to be the sole source of nutrition for an infant, but every drop counts!)

The main issue lies in whether the ducts that transport milk to the nipple remain intact or get severed and form scar tissue.

The peri-areolar surgical technique has a much better prognosis for successful future lactation than does the double-incision technique.

Additionally, when you lactate in the future, you can feed your baby exclusively by latching to you (even if you’re not producing enough milk to be their sole source of nutrition) through the use of a supplemental nursing system (SNS).

The SNS can be providing the infant with milk from a partner, donor human milk, or formula, while they’re latching and nursing from you.

Hope that’s helpful info! :)"

And because parenthood is presented as The Only Acceptable Way, there’s no pause encouraged for folks to evaluate whether or not they are actually fit to be a parent, or if they need to maybe sort some shit out first and heal from their own trauma before they risk passing it on.

Combine that with the fact that our society also presents parenthood as The Cure for Everything (empty inside? have a baby. marriage falling apart? a baby will fix it!) I think more deeply broken people are pushed into parenthood blindly without the tools and resources to do it responsibly and it just turns into a perfect storm.
