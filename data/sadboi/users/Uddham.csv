depression,fdgmkmi,t3_el7fo7,1578402348.0,"To be honest with you whether you had left the note or not clearly you wasnt meant to end it all. As you said yourself your body wouldnt move and you couldnt budge clearly you subconsciously still have hope and dreams. You gotta pull that from within you because once you do you'll be unstoppable 

By the use of the word ""sectioned"" I'm going under the assumption you're in the UK you're the same age as me I was in a similar situation during my first year ot college suffering from severe depression and anxiety for 2 years straight and 1 year spent in therapy. As you probably get told by your college to reach out the time cause that's what mine did also with whatever agency you're with regarding your mental health make sure you like your therapist if you dont you can change it so you feel more comfortable or at least I was able to when I was with CAHMS. 

If you ever need to talk feel free to dm me or something cause I'm literally at the same stage you're at in life both mentally and literally in the sense that we are both in college and I believe I can help you or try to at least. But by the looks of it, it looks like you have people around you good people too. Hold on to them they clearly care a lot about you."

Sikhism overlaps with a lot of religions due to it being a newer religion its only been around for about 500 years on top of that the first teacher of Sikhism traveled a lot of Asia to spread the message that there is only one God and it is whatever you call it to be for Islam its Allah for Christian's it's The Lord and for people who believe in science it's the big bang theory or evolution etc. In our holy book it actually talks about the first cell that ever split. It's very spiritual but also very factual at some points too.
