It was me, and almost all my family playing tag in our back yard; mom, dad, siblings, cousins, stepdad, stepsiblings,  and my grandparents sitting on the balcony drinking coffee and watching us play.

depression,eq6tx6g,t1_eq6sz9p,1559835354.0,"Because I recently told a friend of mine about a story I wrote in like middleschool based on a quote that for some reason stuck with me. It was something about how it only takes 5 minutes to become a hero.

The idea behind it is that you tell yourself ""alright, I can take it for 5 minutes extra, doesn't hurt to try, it's only 5 minutes"". And then when those five minutes have passed, you try to see if you can do 5 more. Before you know it, you've done 20 minutes. And even if you then can't do it anymore, at least nobody can take those 20 minutes of being strong from you. Not even you can take them away!

It's like trying to go about your day and simultaneously trying to keep a person who is trying to beat you in the face at arms length.
Also, I'd say that patience and kindness goes a long way. You'll never know how much a smile/compliment/phonecall/""how are you really?"" can help"
