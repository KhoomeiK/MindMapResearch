I felt this for years even at my parents house, it's become a lot less frequent in recent years as I've built up a life I can tolerate. I would describe it as kind of missing a home that you haven't found yet. When you find it, you will only miss it when you go away for long vacations :)"

Personally as someone who is fat but was way fatter last year I can agree nobody has ever made fun of me at the gym, that being said I think people do stare. The only person to really mention my weight were people who see me there all the time and ask how much I've lost.

With all that being said, I find myself looking at other fat people and comparing myself. ""Like am I that fat?"" ""You think he/she will stick with it?"" etc. Not sure if that's the same as fat shaming, I try to talk as little as possible when at the gym üòÇ"

I then gained a lot of weight back Dec 26th of 2018 I was back up to 163kg (350 lbs?) Since then the progress has been a little more linear. 

Officially I started going to the gym around a year ago although very inconsistently and I had no idea what I was doing. The last maybe 3-5months I started working smarter and more consistently and that's when I feel the major results started coming in."
