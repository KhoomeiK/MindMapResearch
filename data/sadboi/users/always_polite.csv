Freelancers, gig workers, and independent contractors

We have new information about applying for Unemployment benefits: Read our guides for self-employed individuals.
$600 Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (PUC)

If you are currently collecting unemployment: Residents already collecting unemployment will begin to see their $600 supplemental unemployment benefit arrive April 14 (for the week of March 29th). It will be a separate payment from your regular unemployment benefit, and will continue through July 25.
 
New filers: You also will be eligible for the additional $600/week; it will be retroactive to the week of March 29th.

We are also awaiting guidance on the 13-week extension of unemployment benefits. Please check back for details.

I clicked on the guides on the website too but it doesn't share any information about people who have their claims status as ""filed"" and receive 0 regarding the federal $600.

Really confused."
