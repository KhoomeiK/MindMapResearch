CPTSD,fr031bs,t1_fr0065d,1589782262.0,"Yes!!!!! Exactly. I was raised in a sort of evangelical Christian church/cult and even when we prayed, they separated the little boys and girls. Like even in Sunday school. It was nasty and it was always the worst assumed when you talked to the opposite gender. Even when me and another girl got too close, they separated us because it seemed sexual... 😶😮😮😮"
CPTSD,fqzzqyl,t1_fqzttcb,1589779617.0,"There is a huge thing about splitting genders. My parents were very on board with this, so they shamed me as well as the church. I think there’s a ton of shame involved in being around the opposite gender because it was so demonized honestly. What do you think?"
CPTSD,fqzyibr,t3_glt2y4,1589778657.0,Yes. I was legit about to use that “cute”. You’re making me think 🧐 I thought it was for endorphins and relaxation. It usually relaxes my armored muscles but I do hurt myself a bit. Interesting.

CPTSD,fqzddee,t1_fqyza4m,1589765009.0,I couldn’t agree with this comment more. I didn’t even think about the gaslighting and manipulation being told “you’re overreacting” and “you’re crazy” makes us search for more validation. Like “I’m not overreacting right?” and “I’m not crazy right?” and “please believe me. You guys believe me right?”. We’re trained to think we’re cray
CPTSD,fqzd3oc,t3_glky9h,1589764847.0,"I see what you mean. I’ve done this before. For a lot of people with CPTSD, there was extreme isolation from peers, so it’s really easy to feel crazy. I’m sure you know about that since you post on here ❤️ for me, it’s definitely needing reassurance. Like since I was isolated so much ( I was homeschooled up until I was 14 and then I did running start so I was still “isolated” since I was around 18 and 20 year olds), I thought dads beating their children was normal and my church normalized it as well. It was a cult. So I think there’s a lot of situations out there where people just don’t want to feel crazy anymore and they know that some people on CPTSD can relate. Sometimes I need reassurance that what happened was a) real and b) abuse. Some people have really gone through crazy shit. I’m not meaning to make this sound condescending IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, but speaking as someone who has done that, I’m just explaining my point of view. Trolls can definitely post but I doubt that they would try and post in such a specific category of mental illness. I, personally, just give that person the benefit of the doubt because if it was real, it must’ve been very scary ❤️"

FemaleDatingStrategy,fpn5hzr,t3_gea7kq,1588750943.0,"So proud of you! My standards are changing as well. My new standards are:

He has to have a body type I am attracted to. Either muscular or lean and strong. If he doesn’t have abs, he at least has to have a wiry, fit body. 

He has to listen to me, and be kind and caring. No more getting sarcastic jabs to hurt me. If he makes constant jabs at me, I don’t want him. My mental health is more important. 

He can’t be 4+ older than me. I’m 20 so I feel like this is a valid concern. 

He had to be at LEAST 5’9.

He has to buy me occasional gifts or I don’t want him. 

He has to have a lucrative job so he’s not constantly asking for money 🙄 or making constant excuses about why he can’t get me something or buy my food. GOD I’ve dealt with that a lot. LVM shit. No more."

CPTSDFightMode,fp8sq7w,t1_fp8scu0,1588401740.0,"I haven’t really dug into whether or not I have exercise related trauma. I do know that I wasn’t allowed to do active things as a kid because my parents were in a cult and they made me wear skirts below my knees. It made it hard for me to ever be active and as a result I became a little couch potato. I’m naturally an active person though, so I feel like it was a huge emotional loss for me. I’m hugely uncoordinated due to being trapped in skirts my entire life even though as a kid, I was really into sports and was pretty good. Athleticism runs in my family so they really fucked me over. 😠

I might have to do the fast, hard workouts because it really affects me.. I just need to learn to calm down afterwards. And when my muscles are incredibly tense and I’m having a hard time breathing it reminds my body of bad situations."
