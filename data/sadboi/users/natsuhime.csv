needadvice,esfmto5,t3_c7hw3z,1561929992.0,"I have a few pieces of advice for you. The first is to job shadow the role you’re thinking you might want to do. That is the best way to truly see if a job is up your alley or not. My senior year of high school, I had my heart set on becoming a Music Therapist. I loved music and psychology, so on paper, it sounded perfect for me. But, one day I job shadowed one in a neurological rehab center  and realized the medical setting was just way too depressing for me. I could see myself becoming burnt out on feeling horrible for my patients and just hating being in a hospital in general. So yes, job shadow for sure.

Secondly, you can always find a middle to be content with. For example, a degree that includes both a passion and something practical. For me, that was majoring in business and theatre. I was able to indulge in my creative side while also learning business which is pretty universal when it comes to job hunting. Taking a route like this can help open so many doors for you. Taking my scenario for example, I can choose to chase theatre, focus on business, or even mash the two together and do business for a theatre (marketing, etc etc). So maybe a dual or double major may be a good consideration.

Lastly, and possibly the most important, is that a major does NOT always define what you will do past college. You are not stuck in the field you decide to major in. There are psychology majors that now do logistics, math majors in business fields, and so on and so forth. Just having a degree will give you endless paths to choose from. So remind yourself you are not stuck. You have endless exciting possibilities ahead of you :)"
