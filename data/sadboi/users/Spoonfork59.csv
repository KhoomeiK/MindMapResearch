I remember an article a while back about this guy who saw a woman and her toddler walking and laughing or smiling or something and he just punched her in the stomach and the reason why was cuz they looked happy. Theirs this anger that comes from somewhere and this awful dark power says you need dominance to overcome it and make it yours. I dunno. This is unimaginable but how do we stop these people.

Stir till it coats everything.  Deeper red. Then add the 2 0z vodka to deglaze and maybe if need be take a shot. Lol. Stir to mix that shit together well. Reduce heat to low. Use 1/4 cup of the boiling water for the pasta and add that. Personally I think add a bit more. Then slowly add 3/4 cup of cream stirring till everything is legit and smooth.  At some point now you should probably taste it and add salt or not I dont know you! Put a lid on that. Oh wait.  After you deglaze with the vodka and stir add a generous amount of shredded parm and stir that cheeso around. So. Lid on low. Throw your pasta in the water. Get that happening and when it's done.
