depression,ffc319f,t3_ess9je,1579790292.0,"cutting becomes addictive. it’s never a good coping mechanism. one small cut turns into hundreds, hundreds turn into thousands. soon you cut deeper and deeper. it’s not good. cutting will give you momentary relief but soon after leaving you feeling like shit. you’ll become desperate for any way to harm yourself. it’ll become where your every thought is filled with it sometimes. it might sound better than the thoughts of your emotional pain, but it’s really not.

it’s happened to me. i cut myself one day in the kitchen thinking “oh well it’s not like i’ll do it again” but now i’m here, 2-3 years later, still doing it. there’s a point where you feel you can’t stop. please never turn into what i have."

i know i might not convince you, but you are who you want to be. so many people are transphobic but there are people out there."
