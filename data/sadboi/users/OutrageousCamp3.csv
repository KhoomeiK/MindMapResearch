Giving up your passion won’t help your wife or fix your marriage. If anything, it’s enabling her to act in an unhealthy way. I understand that she’s struggling with an eating disorder, but that doesn’t mean she gets to control you or isolate you. Honestly I think that’s abusive behavior. I suspect you would never make her stop a healthy activity that brought joy to her life. My point is, if you give up doing what makes you happy, you’ll be doing so in vain. A marriage can’t be fixed by one person controlling the other. She’s being selfish and abusive."
