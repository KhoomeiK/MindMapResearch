I don't think anybody starts out thinking ""I've got to be an asshole to get ahead.""  But balancing the needs and requests (reasonable and not) of your employees and the demands and directions of your own supervisors is an eternal balancing act.

A lot of supervisors gain more autonomy by meeting their executive overlords demands.  That autonomy allowed them to grant more leniency to their employees... But everything--*everything*--comes at a cost.

After a while, the managers who don't manage the balancing act very well may get demoralised, disempowered or simply ""checked-out"".  And if they don't have very good personal emotional management, it'll lead to burn out or outbursts 

I was a fair middle manager.  I wasnt great, but I wasnt terrible.  I know some ex-employees who will swear I was the devil incarnate: power-hungry, inconsiderate and unfeeling.

I often shoot models against the sunset.  As it gets darker, I need to extend the exposure time.  Sometimes up to 1/2 a second.  

Don't use bulb mode.  Use manual mode (though I suppose other modes will work too).  Find the right exposure for the model with the flash (a light meter really helps!).  Then, simply change the exposure time.  

The slower exposure time allows more ambient light in, giving you more color from the sky, more detail in the background and less of a light drop-off (where it's all dark anywhere beyond a few meters past the model).


Of course, the model needs to remain still, otherwise there's the risk of jitter or movement blur.  And I've found that anything slower than 1/30th of a second had the risk of jitter from my hands, so I use a tripod and a remote release.

You've got the depth of field just right to differentiate the branches from the blades...  

I have two composition suggestions.

One:. Move the shoot point so you don't have the belraches or that there's more space between them and the blade.  But, you know, I think the branches lend the windmill a certain sense of context, and the diagonal of the branch require helps lead the eye... so I'm not heavily sold on this suggestion.

Two: I'd really like a little more space to the left of the windmill.  It's cropped tightly in, and I think an equal space between blade and image edge on either side might help make it a little more powerful.

Seriously, though, these suggestions are pretty minor.  The colors are lovely, and the gradient of sky works really well with the subject matter.   It's a nice mix between fond reminiscence and brooding memory.  Evocative.

One fantastic suggestion I heard for quick game scenarios is to look up the plot summary of a police procedural (NCIS, CSI, Law & Order, etc) episode and give it a Dresden supernatural twist.   Quick n dirty but deliciously effective.

Other suggestions I have from personal experience (with DFRPG, not DFA):

Shorten the city creation or do city creation side by side with the first few sessions.  Let the players get a feel for their characters.  It's okay to  -not- have the whole city work-up.  Our game went for years without it.

Give every character a spotlight.  But if there's no ""investigator"" type, don't feel you have to create a Dreden style mystery.   Just find a way to get all the PCs invested & together, with some sort of unified goal.

If you can't think of a cool success or a cool failure, don't roll: just give them the cool choice.

Character creation should be transparent to the table.  I believe characters should have secrets, but not players.  Other players can often come up with really cool ways to complicate & highlight other players stories and aspects.

If you have a loose framework of a story, then you've got a lot of room for the players to take it in a completely different direction... If there excited about it..  well, why not?"

Having an assigned role--even if it's made up--really helps.  The structure of the role provides rules and guidelines and often escape routes if needed."

They want to help you get what you need to ensure theres no legal blowback."

Of course, I'm going to have to get a group together to play before I can go out and demo it to the local conventions!"
creepypasta,f10fmwx,t3_d7bhn6,1569111829.0,"I sometimes get Jamais vu when driving... 

Usually it's a familiar place but at an unusual time. I work graveyards, so driving the route home in the evening is sometimes disturbing   If I let my mind drift (or get engaged in conversation, etc.) it tends to hit more often.  I have moments where I think maybe I've missed my exit, but no...  The sun's just in the wrong place."

Congratulations!

I shoot some boudoir, and I'm slowly getting better.

Soft lighting is awesome.  I like it more than harsh light.  So... diffusers and beauty dishes if natural light isn't your primary.

There is power in interacting directly with the camera.  Sometimes too much.  But there is intimacy in catching the averted gaze.  Some of my favorite shots are adjusting clothes or otherwise looking away.  It's like your capturing an intimate, private moment.

Depth of field has a huge impact!

You're also selling the experience.  So, find -something- about the model that works for you and leverage the hell out that.    

Share your excitement with the model. It may really help the report and confidence which wil have a huge impact on the quality of the shots.

Remember that the model knows how she looks. You don't need to over-edit."
