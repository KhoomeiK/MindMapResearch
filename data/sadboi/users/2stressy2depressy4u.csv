depression,eotwotk,t1_eotw26x,1558850766.0,"One thing I do to try and cope is to just live in the moment. Try and listen to all the sounds I can hear, look at everything I can, and just take it all in. Another thing that really helps is spending time with people. Having people around I’m comfortable with really snaps me back in to reality. But my main coping mechanism is lots and lots of marijuana. Don’t be like me"

depression,eotvl6q,t3_bt4huq,1558849911.0,"Yes. My psychiatrist calls it dissociation from reality. It’s pretty much what your mind does to numb the brain, it just disconnects itself from what is happening. I’ve been that way for a while to the point where I question if I even exist or if this is just some shitty dream."
Anxiety,eotvi0w,t1_eotv4fc,1558849812.0,"Yes, I’ve been a few different antidepressants, anti anxiety, bipolar, blood pressure meds, all sorts. But nothing particularly for the ticks/twitches. It doesn’t bother me as much as my psychological symptoms, so the tics really aren’t that bad in comparison, so I find myself just accepting that’s how I am."
depression,eotvamw,t3_bt495x,1558849594.0,"Being agnostic/atheist I feel this hardcore. “Knowing” that life is meaningless, and at the universal scale, we mean actually nothing. My personal philosophy is that since we are all stuck on this rock together, we need to be there for each other and help each other out. So I do my best to get a smile out of people, listen to them, give them words of advice, and show them that I care. And while we are stuck here, we might as well do something. Because time is going to pass wether you lay in bed all day, or if you go out to the park and take a walk, or spend time with people you care about. We are all that we have"
Anxiety,eotuxj4,t3_bt4apu,1558849345.0,"As my anxiety worsened over times, the tics went from being occasional and not really noticeable, to happening every 15-30 minutes, and now the tics happen about 30 seconds to 5 minutes apart now. The muscle twitching happens multiple times a minute. All of the is happening from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep."
depression,eotuq4v,t1_eottpl9,1558849212.0,"Don’t ever think that your love wasn’t enough. It sounds like he wasn’t bright enough to see the amazing, loving, and kind person you are. He sounds like a complete idiot. And I double-down on calling him an idiot for having a gambling addiction. That is not a good long term habit to look for in a partner, it shows irresponsibility and carelessness with money. 

You should love yourself and rejoice at yourself for being capable of putting out so much love into the world. You should be happy that you don’t have to be weighed down by his problems anymore. It was never your job to fix everyone else’s problems, literally everybody has problems. 

You are going to make somebody as very happy man someday, and he will appreciate you for what you are and be as concerned about your problems as you are about his. Somebody that doesn’t take away from you. Somebody that adds on to what you give. 

Just don’t be afraid to let your guard down for somebody. Nobodies intention is EVER to hurt you from the start. Life is about taking risks. For example, if you don’t get out of bed tomorrow, you have a 0% chance of finding a stack of $100 bills on the sidewalk."

Anxiety,eottomy,t3_bt4apu,1558848554.0,"Tics and twitches can be one of anxiety’s physical manifestations. In my case it is a mix of that and VERY extensive marijuana use. Pretty much every muscle in my body has twitched at some time, which happens probably 3-4 times a minute. My legs also have tics that make them kick out a bit, but doesn’t effect my walking/standing at all as it isn’t severe. My hands are also very trembly. If it worries you to the point where it’s getting in the way of your day to day life, then I think it would be a good idea to speak with a professional."
