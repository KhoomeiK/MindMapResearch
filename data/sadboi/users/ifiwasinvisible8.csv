When you are alone with her(make sure you are alone, people act different with an audience) , let her know how you feel when she says negative things about you. Use an ‚ÄúI statement‚Äù. For example ‚Äú It really hurts my feelings when you call me a fake bitch, or say that I am ugly. I would like for you to stop doing that.‚Äù If she says she is joking. Say you find it disrespectful and want it to stop. 

I know you may be nervous to call her out on it. But you will feel proud of yourself afterwards. Every time I have ever confronted someone and was assertive, they apologized and stopped the behavior, and Im not naturally an assertive person. 

Please stand up for yourself. And if she doesn‚Äôt respect  your boundaries she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be your friend."

Sometimes medications can make symptoms worse. I went on Zoloft because I was anxious and it made me feel  suicidal. I kept communicating with my doctor and I was eventually prescribed Trintellix, it worked wonders. Please continue to let your doctor know how the medications are working for you.  If you do not advocate for yourself, there is no way for them to help you. 

If you have a plan for suicide please contact 911 immediately. The hospital is often helpful because you feel safe, and kinda hidden away from the world. They can also monitor any med changes, and you get the chance to participate in group therapy. 

I know you said that therapy did not help you, but please consider group therapy. Sometimes it is nice to know that you are not alone in what you are experiencing. I am sorry for the way your father treats you . Please know that it has nothing to do with your worth as a person. He has obviously his own issues that need to be addressed. 

I hope you do not hurt yourself, and I hope you can get the help you need. Please know that you are worthy of happiness. And remember that life goes through cycles. It will turn around eventually. I am sending good vibes your way‚ù§Ô∏è"
