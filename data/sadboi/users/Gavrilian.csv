In addition I have been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember, which, while may not be the same situation you are in, I've seen a number of therapists and psychiatrists that have been extremely helpful.

If nothing else, I have no idea what you are going through, but it sounds like you believe you need the help, so I would encourage you to keep seeing someone even if you need to go through another 5+ to find the right one.

Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, first, they were all on bumble. Not sure what's going on there. Second, we texted for a few days, and... Now that I think about it, no one's actually said no. One we scheduled, she put it off, (red flag, but there could be a legit reason), and disappeared the night before the 'appointment'. The other said she has really bad anxiety and actually reappeared later, but never asked me any questions, so I lost interest pretty quickly. I will fully admit that looks play a large part in whether I put yes or no, but that didn't make a difference in her willingness to meet (I know she wasn't a catfish cause she streamed overwatch and I did a bit of lurking: *I* thought she was cute.). Uh, let's see the rest, I mean we did a bit of texting, I tried to schedule for the weekends, I did all the thin- er planning, I kept the conversation going essentially by myself. Yeah, there's a lot of red and yellow flags, but I'm not... The most social person, so I figured I would meet in person, maybe they would be cool in person, and even if I decide not to continue, at least I got some practice going on a date. Lol.

I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who would rather get that than no response. That said, guys on dating apps... I figure the majority are creepers, incels, or something like that, so gals probably get a lot of bull shit when they say no, so I kind of understand even though it's frustrating.

Uh let's see, what else... Um, santa barbara sucks cause everyone is a model and wants to date a model, are not attractive to me, or they're so far out of my league it's kinda rediculous (these are usually the engineering students and/or work for NASA at Vandenberg AFB.

Now, If it's important to you, do it yourself. And last, if someone forgot, wouldn't you want to know that now, before going, than after you sat at a table alone for half an hour?

Hopefully it doesn't come back to bite me later.

It's... not just guys. I've had this happen to me at least twice that I can think of off the top of my head. I get it, traditionally the guy does all the ~~thinking~~ planning, but I mean, you gotta show some interest too. Out of three years of having a profile on one platform or another, I've only had one actually ask me questions and message me first. And I'm not talking about the initial message, but half way through the week you're texting before the date... I'm ranting again.

So anyway, to clarify, he asked you out, and... didn't say anything after that? Or were you talking throughout the day, and he just didn't double check? How much time passed between when you said ""yes"" and the time of the date? If it's more than 24 hours, I get it, they may have changed their mind or something came up, and decided their time was more important than yours. 

That said, if you feel that something is necessary, you should either tell them that it's important to you (don't want to waste time on someone who doesn't care about what's important to you) or do it yourself (personally preferred option since it shares a little responsibility).

OnlineDating,fe6iqon,t1_fe2b9i5,1578892188.0,"TLDR: uh, can someone summarize this for me? I kinda went on a rant.

I mean, I get both sides of the argument, I will acknowledge that looks play a large part in with I give a yes or no, but honestly, if I saw a profile that had everything I'm looking for, but whether or not the profile has pictures I would immediately assume it's a catfish. Pictures have nothing to do with it. Same with bots. If there's a bunch of typos and broken English my first thought is going to be bot. It's not really about safety either though. It's more ""I don't want to waste my time texting some asshole fat dude posing as a hot chic"". Pictures don't guarantee anything, but they do make catfishing more difficult. That said, if I saw a profile of a slightly below average woman who is just really fucking awesome, hell yeah I would try to match with them. And I'm sorry, but I'm not going to bother with someone I think is ugly. Someone is bound to find them attractive eventually, and I don't know them; I'm not going to chance them being ugly, ***and*** have an incompatible personality. It's just not worth my time.

Finally, taking looking out of the picture (heh), photos give me another look at their interests and personality. Are they outside all the time? Are they all group photos? Are they smiling? Are they drinking? Is the photo blurry? Pictures can tell you more than a thousand words in a bio.

I will again admit that I'm pretty picky, but intimacy (sex is only part of intimacy, for my definition at any rate) is a huge thing for me. I can't be bothered if I don't find them attractive or they don't have pictures.

And I would feel bad about messaging someone I would want a purely platonic relationship with. Unless they specifically say they're only interested in friends, outside of fwb, why would they be on here if not to find an SO?

So to follow what I learned in high school English, yeah, pictures are important."

Back to the topic at hand, that's been about my experience too, even when I mention something on their profile. Sometimes I'll make a joke, but since text is such an ***amazing*** communication method I try to only do that if there's nothing interesting on their bio. So it baffles me when I match with someone, either they start (bumble) or they reply (usually ""It was great! I had a lot of fun."" when I've asked about a trip they were clearly excited about) and when I ask for details, I get nothing. I mean, they swiped positive (I really hope our generation doesn't become known as the the generation that made right attractive and left unattractive), so they apparently find me attractive enough to warrant some attention, but why swipe right of you're not interested? Am I the only one who checks bios before deciding left or right? Why waste both our time with a message when you have no intention to follow up? Sure life can get in the way sometimes, but way too many do this for it to just be that they forgot or something. I'm not so much frustrated with them as much as their actions don't make sense to me. why bother?

Oops, I'm gonna step off my soap box (is that the right phrase? I've never seen it written), and apologize for the rant. So anyway, yeah, I share your experience and have found that even doing as others have suggested, mentioning something from their bio doesn't seem to make much difference. Although, that could be attributed to the area of Santa Barbara. I seem to have more conversations with people in Ventura, Camarillo, Lompoc, and Santa Maria for whatever reason. I have no evidence, but I blame UCSB and Isla Vista."

BDSMAdvice,fe4d7dr,t3_enm7as,1578858026.0,"TLDR: Can you be prosecuted for having an orgasm in public in the US? I would expect some looks, but no one would call the cops would they?

At the risk of sounding like an idiot, what exactly are the laws regarding this? I've seen a lot of comments about not involving others, but is there an actual law regarding this? I know it greatly depends on where you are, so lets go with USA federal law. If there's no nudity, at what point does it become a public disturbance? Taking the BDSM community general understanding of ""consent of all involved"" out of the picture (cause you could argue that they're involved even without interactions), moaning, as long as it's not too loud, and shaking in an obvious orgasm doesn't seem like something you should get in trouble for. You'd get strange and/or disapproving looks, but I can't imagine someone (Americans at least, I won't speak for elsewhere) calling the cops for that. Am I wrong? Is my thinking skewed? Am I a lot more open minded than I thought? Is my sand grain sized faith in humanity misplaced (and likely to get smaller)?

DISCLAIMER: I live in Cali, so my view is likely more liberal than the rest of the world. Not in the political sense, more in the ""there's a gray area; protestant vs catholic"" sense. I try too hard to be inoffensive."

This may be a bit off topic, so if it needs to move let know."
BDSMAdvice,fdf6twu,t1_fdeu53p,1578354647.0,"Huh, that sounds surprisingly familiar. This'll get me thinking.
I've only very recently moved forward outside of vanilla, and I've always preferred being Dom, but my life outside the bedroom does not reflect that in any way. Seeing that your thinking has changed after opening up makes me wonder."

There's significant differences, I know, but I want to acknowledge the small bit of CNC that *might* feel lumped in. I dunno, I try to think of everyone and maybe I'm over thinking things. Now that I think about I suppose my comment could just as easily offend CNC...🤷‍♂️"
BDSMAdvice,fdf449k,t1_fdei5aj,1578352864.0,"Yeah, as much as I am a free speech fan, there does come a point where something that would normally be just abnormal becomes mental illness. Kinkshaming is not OK, but then neither is pedophilia (not the same, but the concept stands in light of my previous sentence).
Hope that makes sense. My thinking tends to meander and make links that don't always make sense outside the context of my thoughts. <- I think that's the best way I've ever said that."

I'm a bit of a shut in, so I don't have much in the way of relationships, but I've been able to steer clear of the really nasty people for the most part. I can't say I sympathize, but I do empathize (I may have mixed those up). I've been struggling with self image, but not body image. That's gotta be tough. Sounds like you're on your way to a healthy self image though. It's always encouraging to hear that people such as you and OP, are getting through and seeing the end in sight."
BDSMAdvice,fcyfgl3,t1_fcxjgbf,1578079288.0,"Right? It seems strange to me that a woman would make jabs in that area. I'm not sexist by any means (says the anonymous person on the internet), I'm just acknowledging women have a tendency to be more sensitive in the beauty area."
