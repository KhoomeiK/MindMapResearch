It was relieving in a way to read that you were okay, weren't angry. It gives me hope that if I ever see him again maybe I'd be okay too. Thank you for sharing"

Cooking,fazxo39,t3_eassfn,1576420558.0,"I was making rice pudding, and was at the last step where you have finished everything but keep stirring until it's the consistency you want your pudding. 

I made the mistake of waiting until it was the exact consistency I wanted to take it off from the burner, forgetting that the pudding has JUST come off the burner and is still incredibly hot, and therefore still cooking.

Long story short, my rice pudding became very over cooked and clumpy, not at all like pudding. Although it was still delicious."

ptsd,f6g0y4z,t3_dr60r7,1572820487.0,"YES this happened to me as well. I smoked weed regularly, for years before my assault happened. But afterwards, when I started showing signs of PTSD, smoking would make me dissociate like crazy, my entire body shook and I felt like I couldn't breathe, sometimes I even choked. It's been over a year since the last time I tried smoking because I'm too scared to risk having that reaction again."

ptsd,f1dasoe,t3_d8trwq,1569378462.0,"I was also prescribed Prazosin for nightmares. I took 3mg for 6 months, but it ended up not working well for me. I still had nightmares, but just less of them, so I continued it for the full 6 months until my psychiatrist and I decided to increase my Zoloft, which did work/still works for me. So yeah, it didn't work out as we had hoped, but I didn't experience any negative side effects from the medication. 

I hope this helps! Best wishes ðŸ˜Š"
