Abuse implies some kind of malicious intent. Since the definition of abuse is to treat with cruelty or violence. I believe abuse describes acts committed through hatred or indifference. 

Am I expected to say here that I love my child with everything I have but, because I fed him a vegan diet and approached vaccinations with caution, I am guilty of abusing him? Is that the conclusion I'm supposed to come to here? 

Of course then we wander into the realm of whether or not the things I did were out of love for him, or a need for control.

When they called him in for questioning he told them I shoved his daughter (not my child) over then bashed her head into a door. The 8 year old daughter corroborated his story and even gave a video recorded interview with the police. I had to then be interviewed by police and had children's services questioning me at home to make sure I wasn't abusing my son. May not seem like a big deal but my nerves were already hanging by a thread and this was the ultimate power move on his part.
