AskWomen,fqhpyl0,t3_gil16z,1589382047.0,"I really enjoyed my last job, I believed in the work that we were doing (low income housing assistance) and the relaxed schedule was really convenient. But I kept getting more and more worked sloughed off from the manager, and when I would ask her for help my emails either went unanswered or she told me to ask someone else to help (even though she was responsible for delegating duties), or that I was allowed overtime. We were short staffed and it was really uncomfortable asking co-workers for help because they were overloaded too, and I was already working around 6 hours overtime a week.This management style caused me so much anxiety, I never knew when I was going to get more work to do and I didn’t have enough time to do the work I already had. 

We would have team meetings where the employees would get asked what could help them to succeed and literally the answers were: faster computers (I think the ones we were using were from 2010) and being assigned a back up for when our work was overloaded. Neither of those things ever happened, over multiple meetings.

I worked there from 2016-2018 loving my job (even with it being social work), and when other employees left in dec of 2018 and I got all of their duties, I was done. I just got a new job this year and it is a hundred times better- workload wise, management wise, equipment wise, everything. Even if this CoVid thing eliminates my new position, and my old boss has offered my job back to me multiple times, I’d never go back, I’d rather go back to serving than work under her again."

AskWomen,fjf9m78,t3_fcyl1y,1583287214.0,"Mine is a girl I considered my best friend for 3 years, up until about 2 years ago. We agreed to live together in March of 2017, and for the first year and a half, we lived in a different house and everything was pretty relaxed, we each had our own level (and then then one common level) of a three story home so we weren’t in eachothers faces. We also worked for the same company, but different departments. 

When we moved into her parents house (they had retired months earlier and emptied the house), everything went sour. She would continuously cross every boundary we had previously agreed on as roommates, and not only that- but she became rather sullen and cynical. I honestly counted a whole month where she never initiated conversation with me. 30 whole days where she basically ignored my presence when I walked into the room, unless I said something first. Even when I did initiate conversation, she would literally grunt at me and not even use real words (all the whole being super kind and chatty to deliver men, friends stopping by, etc). 

Months ago, I asked her if I could use her as a job reference and when my new job called to ask her about my performance, she ignored their calls and later drunkenly told me that she’s glad she didn’t answer because she would’ve given me a bad review so I had to stay at my current job (she would have been brought in to cover some excess work because they had me overloaded managing 2 departments). I got the job anyway and as soon as I put in my 2 weeks- shit hit the fan. She told me that she was “proud of me for following my dreams, but that she could never be happy for me”.  She cried to all of our friends about how hard her life was going to be because I was leaving, and her borderline alcoholic tendencies pushed over the edge.


I can’t move out yet because me and my bf are buying a house this summer and we live in a really high cost of living city. Things have gotten so awkward, I basically hole up in my room and keep to myself. It’s a huge bummer, but she has taken the victim road of “I’m leaving her behind”, and I don’t have the energy to coax her forward."
