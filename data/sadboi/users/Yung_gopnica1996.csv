AmItheAsshole,fjzwjxb,t1_fjzwdkb,1583731855.0,We didn’t talk about proposals but we did discuss the ring many times. Well when I asked why he didn’t get down on one knee he said he wanted to be equal to me which is kind of cute and feminist I guess. I can kind of get around that. But when I asked why he didn’t use a ring he says it’s the proposal that means something and not the ring to show. Which just makes me feel like a materialistic ungrateful bitch
AmItheAsshole,fjzw4zc,t1_fjzvz9q,1583731431.0,Yes we had talked about it many times before!! I had told him I didn’t want anything crazy expensive maybe a vintage emerald ring. In the year before the engagement he bought a really expensive car and spent a lot of money on car parts
AmItheAsshole,fjzuccz,t1_fjzu7yl,1583729669.0,He said he had been planning it a year before and had asked my parents around then too
zoloft,fimbb94,t1_fimay96,1582523827.0,Thanks heaps. I might lower my dosage if those things don’t work!
zoloft,fimb9gr,t1_fimb8dd,1582523781.0,It’s horrible innit
zoloft,fim69yk,t3_f7wjhv,1582519372.0,Yep! I have the most insane dreams now and I’ve never been a dreamer
zoloft,fim5ul8,t3_f83zb1,1582519022.0,I initially took it in the morning and would crash in the afternoon and have to sleep for a couple of hours. It then started making my sleep bad? Tossing and turning all night. I’ve changed to taking it at around 5pm and it’s working way better for me now
zoloft,fia82jf,t3_f6zf8k,1582295307.0,Meeeee. I wake up with the worst headaches every morning. During the day I’ll notice my jaw is mad tight and holding heaps of tension. I also grind my teeth super bad at night. I wonder why this is
zoloft,fia7xtm,t3_f72s2c,1582295220.0,Keep at it buddy it gets easier! Week 5 for me now and it’s starting to really work. First 3 weeks were absolute hell
zoloft,fhegcxy,t1_fheg65p,1581521815.0,That sounds like something someone from Sydney would say!
zoloft,fhegbts,t1_fhefzbg,1581521796.0,I have the same thing due to an attempted overdose once. I had a full blown panic attack about two months ago because I accidentally drank cleaning vinegar (which is just normal vinegar but stronger). I constantly feel like I’m gunna die from something. I hope things get better for you and you find the right medication! Definitely speak to your psych
zoloft,fheg0ln,t1_fheezgr,1581521600.0,Ayyyyy. West side is the best
zoloft,fhefhyu,t1_fhe4vlr,1581521277.0,"I’ve done a lot of drugs but nothing compares to the way antidepressants make you feel when you first start taking them. You will feel horrible I’ll be honest. I felt uncomfortable and not like myself, like I was coming up on molly almost (sweats, adrenaline). Weird brain zaps and vision changes. Your brain has just had a massive shock to it. The way you feel the first couple of weeks isnt the best and like nothing else you will ever experience. My heart hurts for you but it gets better. You definitely aren’t alone <3"
zoloft,fheev3j,t1_fheemwb,1581520879.0,Ahhh I see. I’m currently on holiday in Japan and nearly crapped my dacks in a sacred temple today LMAO it was baaaad. Could also be the whiskey sours I drank last night. Thanks heaps for the advice! :)
zoloft,fheemrr,t1_fhea19k,1581520730.0,Thanks for the tip! <3 I would have thought that would have made it worse lol

heroin,fhedymo,t1_fhebbuv,1581520303.0,It’s not quite necrotic it looks like her hands have been like burnt by ash or stained constantly. A friend mentioned something called crack hands which is apparently a thing cause by the burning of the pipe
zoloft,fhe3txa,t3_f1uy0o,1581512878.0,Thankyou for this. I needed it
zoloft,fhe3rik,t3_f2hiam,1581512821.0,Dude I feel you. I felt weird and dissociative and like I was on shrooms. It got better though. My eyesight was kind effected too and I felt high? Hang in there
zoloft,fhe3o6m,t3_f290zm,1581512742.0,"I had this really bad!!! It was like vertigo. Headaches, anxiety increased, less desire in sex. Hang in there it gets better"
zoloft,fgp3okb,t3_ezravy,1580995994.0,The first couple of days for me was amazing too!! But then it turned to hell for the remaining time
zoloft,fgnqzo0,t1_fgnqrm7,1580950961.0,I really feel for you :( my iron was low to begin with (11 when it should be 30). If I’m not working or studying I can easily sleep 8 hours during the day as well as all night.. it’s horrible I can barely keep my eyes open. I also have severe nausea and dizziness. Hoping it subsides... I might change to Prozac if it doesn’t work after these three weeks. From what I remember from years ago the side effects were no where near as bad as this. Stay strong
zoloft,fgnklag,t3_ezb9j6,1580946823.0,Congrats!!! I’m so happy it’s going well for you and awww nothing like a dog to improve your mental health too

zoloft,fgm0whi,t3_ez3u7g,1580915647.0,Does anyone know if it’s okay to take the Wellbutrin with Zoloft? Because I’ve just researched and it’s an anti d too. Just wondering if they counteract each other
zoloft,fgid5mw,t1_fgicrfj,1580817491.0,Thankyou! Does it get better eventually?
zoloft,fgi25ua,t1_fgi1ldo,1580802095.0,Thankyou! I might give it another month as I’m going on holiday for three weeks and won’t be able to get a new script in the country I’m in
zoloft,fgi0ocb,t3_eyfk2e,1580800300.0,Whoahhhh I’m having this exact problem right now and had no idea anaemia could be linked to Zoloft
AmItheAsshole,fgb079q,t3_exk08u,1580657197.0,NTA- absolutely fucking not. This is iconic and made me laugh so much. It reminded me of the time a bunch of old women on the bus were saying my skirt was too short in Croatian and I told them to shut up in Croatian. Just because you work in customer service does not mean you get to be people’s punching bags. You proved to this customer that you aren’t an idiot and can in fact speak TWO languages. Good on you!
LetsNotMeet,ffyylmn,t1_ffyov1p,1580358510.0,I’m not sure what you guys have  in America but in Australia we have a crime stoppers hotline where you can write in or ring up to submit tips!
LetsNotMeet,ffy8ihf,t3_evq9ob,1580340635.0,You know what? It’s never too late to report this. It could be a final clue in a cold case or something. Maybe there was a serial killer or predator in that area at the time and all they need is a description. Never too late
Accutane,ffy7ein,t1_ffx22j4,1580340009.0,Wow thanks angel! This makes me feel a lot better

TrueCrimePodcasts,ffm1kyr,t3_eu6d40,1580047126.0,Not really related but I just watched an intense movie called ‘Farming’ about baby farming. Worth a watch
Casefile,ffm0jc2,t1_ffks2ca,1580046662.0,I agree that it’s the best podcast quality and research wise but the content hasn’t been exciting to me as of late. That episode was pretty nuts though
UnresolvedMysteries,ffjvmti,t1_ffhnjxx,1580008192.0,Exactly what I thought. That shit will make someone loop out worse than meth

perth,ffi1zjy,t3_etj4ud,1579962708.0,Can someone explain to me why the details have been suppressed? Not criticising I’m genuinely curious. I get it’s for the dignity of the families and to help catch the perpetrator (as only he would know the cause of death). But how come every other murder case you can google the cause of death and the knowledge is readily available?
BPD,ffhy47r,t3_etltgl,1579958902.0,Oh god yes. I’ve said the most horrible downright abusive threatening things to my FP when I feel jealous. Especially because he cheated on me a couple of years ago. I legit turn into an absolute monster and then I’m ashamed of what I say. It’s horrible

ClaremontSerialKiller,fffhq4y,t1_ffey5wr,1579884214.0,That’s so cool! Based on his appearance is he what you expected? Do you think he’s guilty? I’ll definitely be going one day next week. Thanks heaps!

Casefile,ffen779,t3_esndao,1579855481.0,I agree. The podcast has kind of lost its sparkle. It’s not necessarily him it’s the content and crimes that he’s talking about. I think he’s trying to do crimes that no one else has covered but it’s backfiring because it’s so boring. Idk just my opinion. His earlier podcasts were amazing
AmItheAsshole,ffemue1,t3_essrci,1579854970.0,YTA- I would be more embarrassed about a ‘peacock’ scheme....that’s kinda tacky
AmItheAsshole,ffehpbw,t3_et07oe,1579848442.0,NTA- definitely not. She sounds like an entitled whiney brat. Also if she’s been with your brother 5 months you would think she would be making more of an effort to be liked? Your bro needs to put her in the bin

ClaremontSerialKiller,ffbns3j,t3_eslry7,1579774675.0,I found the profile to be exactly spot on! Especially the part where they said the community would be incredibly shocked when they found out the perp. Edwards was a sports coach and ‘family man’ and from the outside doesn’t look like a murderer. I think it’s interesting there’s a link between his relationship breakdowns and the murders. Makes me think though why did he stop offending? Was it the birth of his daughter that made him develop empathy? Did he have a psychotic snap and lash out because of this? I was reading about his ex girlfriends experiences and they all seemed pretty normal and unsuspecting. One even said he took it well when she broke up with him. Surely a violent psychopath would show himself in a relationship? If it was him I think he was really good at keeping up a facade and rational character

There are so many pathways into university now. I went back when I was 22 and took it more seriously. At least you can always have the trade to fall back on and work casually to support yourself while ur at uni. It depends if you want to get the studying out of the way though.
