teenmom,fr4zulw,t1_fr2v5d0,1589899969.0,Wow four kids with three different men before the age of 30. This girl needs to keep her legs closed or wear some damn protection. If she was just some girl on the street she would be called a hoe with kids out of wedlock but since she is on T.V she is labelled a celebrity. SMH.
DebateAChristian,fr23bja,t1_fr1hgof,1589830429.0,A lot of them do actually.
teenmom,fr15p3p,t1_fr11cs4,1589813744.0,You think most of the cast are intelligent and have common sense?
AntiAmerica,fr15m6j,t1_fr0v2p8,1589813700.0,Exactly
DebateAChristian,fqyt09z,t1_fqyoanw,1589754058.0,Because God is eternal and it sounds to me like the devil used your prayer to trick you into thinking that he no longer exists. I once prayed to God to allow me to speak to my grandmother (mind you she is deceased). When I went to sleep a bunch of static started coming from my phone and all of a sudden I heard what could only be described as a demonic voice. Weird shit started happening after that. I'm saying all this just to point out the fact that sometimes the devil can play tricks with your mind and make you think that it is God when it is not. Never pray to speak to the deceased by the way. I would never want anyone to experience the demonic shit that I went through.
DebateAChristian,fqynl0a,t1_fqynaim,1589751505.0,Are you sure that wasn't a demon pretending to be God? Because I myself have had demonic dreams.
DebateAChristian,fqymv1p,t1_fqybj3g,1589751168.0,Exactly
DebateAChristian,fqymkyx,t1_fqya5cv,1589751038.0,If God no longer exists than how do you explain him speaking to you in a dream? Wouldn't he have to exists in order to speak to you?
DebateAChristian,fqylki4,t1_fqyj71r,1589750564.0,That still doesn't make any sense.
DebateAChristian,fqylf5w,t1_fqygpz6,1589750493.0,I'm sorry but that makes no sense.
DebateAChristian,fqyl3jr,t1_fqyj7h5,1589750345.0,I think that is why many people refer to themselves as spiritual and not religious. There are many things about Christianity that I don't necessarily understand as well. I also believe that God is real because logically it just makes sense but other things about Christianity I question. I do wonder though why God allows some things to happen to some people and not others but that is my own struggle that I'm dealing with. I don't go to church anymore either because it seems like it has just turned into a business for many people.
DebateAChristian,fqyk2zd,t3_glh9qo,1589749869.0,I think you got that confused with Republicans. They don't believe in climate change or that we are damaging the Earth and need to protect it.
DebateAChristian,fqycr43,t3_gl0asz,1589746480.0,Here is another solution to think about. Maybe people should just stop having kids altogether so that children won't have to suffer in this world or eternity.
DebateAChristian,fqybtlw,t1_fqv9jt8,1589746055.0,Isn't that kind of the point though? That Jesus paid the price for our sins and therefore anyone that believes in Jesus is saved because he died for us? I thought that was the whole point of Christianity.
DebateAChristian,fqyb76n,t1_fqy3wxb,1589745768.0,Nope not necessarily true. I know some women personally that have had an abortion and have no regrets.
DebateAChristian,fqy89z1,t3_gl0asz,1589744302.0,I have always wondered the same thing.
teenmom,fqy829m,t1_fqv068m,1589744193.0,I know right! Most of the time on the show it just shows her being with different men.
blackladies,fqttd9k,t1_fqrt148,1589645728.0,"Lmao but it's funny that they and white people don't think anything of it when white people listen to hip hop and R&B and even become hip hop artist like Eminem and get awarded for it but if a black person tries to get into metal or even listen to it, it's considered weird. The double standard is ridiculous."
blackladies,fqtsxhq,t3_gkgdts,1589645480.0,"Exactly. It's very ignorant. I even have some family members that have told me this. No I'm not trying or care to ""act white"", I'm just educated."
antinatalism,fqti3qu,t1_fqqpzxe,1589639445.0,Wow your mom sounds incredibly smart.
teenmom,fqpjwx0,t1_fqnwc45,1589548152.0,You couldn't go five seconds without being with someone? Wow....no offense but that is sad. A woman should feel confident enough in their own skin to be happy by themselves. To feel like someone constantly needs someone just shows co-dependency.
teenmom,fqmr9mt,t1_fqmbw4l,1589482200.0,Well clearly she did something worthwhile with her money and invested in a nice house before the age of 30 and is spending money to take her son to private school.
teenmom,fqma6uz,t1_fqm5jqt,1589474095.0,I did watch the show and she spent a lot of time with him. It's easy for someone to say they should have accomplished everything in a certain amount of time when they don't have a child of their own. For many people it takes time to earn their degree. I don't see why you are judging her when at the end she earned her degree. A lot of people don't even have that. I'm pretty sure she is the only one on Teen Mom OG that has her degree.
teenmom,fqm415r,t1_fqm0lqs,1589471131.0,"Cate isn't ambitious at all and hasn't tried to really do anything productive besides be on MTV. How is she more intelligent than Maci? At least Maci has tried to work on other endeavors to improve herself. She wrote a book, has her own clothing line and she is an advocacy speaker for PCOS. What exactly has Cate done?"
teenmom,fqm3g1z,t1_fqm1p07,1589470843.0,Umm she had a child to take care of....you don't consider that a responsibility?
teenmom,fqlz099,t1_fqlxafc,1589468630.0,So?? It takes longer for some people. At least she got hers. Do you have a degree?
teenmom,fqlu0lt,t1_fqimdir,1589466051.0,I agree. It took me years to get my college degree and now I have a great career in IT and bought a house by myself.  So as long as they get it that is all that matters.
teenmom,fqlovuu,t1_fqlgysu,1589463182.0,Yeah Jenelle is the worst. I don't think she could go five seconds without having someone.
teenmom,fqloj28,t1_fql2do0,1589462965.0,Why does he hate Cheyenne? And I also think Josh was an asshole to Mckenzie.
teenmom,fqlo9ui,t1_fqlf726,1589462812.0,I'm not mistaking privilege for intelligence. There are many people that are privileged and are airheads. I know the difference. Maci did go to college so she has to have some intelligence there and you can have a great upbringing and be intelligent so I'm not sure what you mean by that last statement.
teenmom,fqjnv0n,t1_fqjk81w,1589412624.0,Granted I do find Maci a little boring but I like that she has a good head on her shoulders. I also think that Tyler and Cate are on different motivational levels. Even Tyler admitted to his mom that Cate seems to lack ambition and can be lazy at times a few seasons ago. His words not mine.
teenmom,fqjczef,t1_fqj999n,1589408202.0,Wow.....
teenmom,fqj9h6y,t1_fqj6vs9,1589406861.0,I definitely agree with that. I also think she needs to just focus on herself and her children. She is not in the right place mentally to be consumed with a relationship.
teenmom,fqj6zf8,t1_fqj682b,1589405897.0,I think Maci is actually pretty smart but I do agree they need to give more tough love to Amber.
teenmom,fqj6s6r,t1_fqj3lvw,1589405818.0,What did she do at the airport?
teenmom,fqj0ryn,t1_fqi6fcz,1589403488.0,Yeah but I can't stand her baby voice. Did she ever get her GED by the way?
teenmom,fqj0j89,t1_fqid77j,1589403393.0,No and after watching the trailer for it I'm glad I haven't.
teenmom,fqj0e8y,t1_fqid81j,1589403340.0,"Yeah that is true. I forgot about that. I also agree that Cate just gives up too easily. She could be doing something she enjoys, like you mentioned with pet grooming. I also do agree that Chey could be a tad bit more direct with how she feels but overall I like her and Maci the most. I like Cate too but she just comes off as unambitious. Amber and her relationships make no sense to me. She is going through a custody battle with the father of her child and she feels like NOW is the time for her to jump into a relationship?? Like damn you can't handle being single for once? I was watching the episode last night where she was complaining about being burned by guys and not sure why she was having trust issues with them. The whole time I was thinking...seriously Amber? You don't know why you have trust issues?? Either she is blind or just straight up stupid."
teenmom,fqiyvyb,t1_fqie5zl,1589402760.0,Yeah I agree
teenmom,fqiysiv,t1_fqiwypi,1589402723.0,Hmm..I thought that was Tyler's idea?
teenmom,fqiivdf,t1_fqi8y4s,1589396586.0,Well Tyler is launching his own clothing line. It may not be a prestigious stem or medical career but at least he is trying to do something.
teenmom,fqi5sg6,t1_folqj8f,1589390702.0,Yeah by three baby daddies. Some classy woman....
teenmom,fqi5pg3,t1_folpswl,1589390641.0,Pretty sad that she already has three baby daddies before the age of 30. Most people would call her a hoe and say she needs to keep her legs closed but I guess since she is on Teen Mom there is an exception...
childfree,fqa1t37,t1_fq9d79n,1589211280.0,I just think people act like you have to be with someone to feel validated and I think that is ridiculous. I think to feel like a person needs someone to feel complete or feel validate just shows they have low self esteem but that is just my opinion. I don't think there is anything wrong with being single. Not everyone finds someone is that is perfectly okay.
childfree,fq68k12,t3_ggu127,1589126659.0,I don't have a baby! Everybody drink!
antinatalism,fq5oqmz,t1_fq3sc15,1589113062.0,I think the only reason people like the US is because it's easier to become rich compared to other countries.
antinatalism,fq5on1r,t1_fq3g58x,1589112972.0,Yeah we do. It's not healthy at all.
antinatalism,fq37l45,t1_fq0d6tm,1589063756.0,Not necessarily. You can get someone to do your taxes. You just have to pay them to do it. Or if you are making less than a certain amount you can have someone do your taxes for free.
antinatalism,fq375vt,t1_fq0c9zl,1589063641.0,and you forgot the cost of health care. Yikes!
antinatalism,fq33ndt,t1_fq2tpbm,1589062696.0,Wow I used to live in Germany. If I still lived there I would do it in a heartbeat. I just find no purpose in continuing to live in this shithole. Thanks mom and dad for forcing me into this shitty world.
antinatalism,fq33dj4,t1_fq2yzrc,1589062624.0,My friend moved to US from a European country and said once he moved here he became depressed. He claims it's the food in the states.
antinatalism,fq0h3pt,t1_fpz0zic,1589031778.0,I don't find them ugly but I do find them gross.
antinatalism,fq0gk9c,t1_fprj0xf,1589031530.0,It's crazy that people only think of Africa as being a poverty place. People seem to forget that there are a lot of well off people in Africa too but yet just focus on the poverty.
antinatalism,fq0g4uh,t1_fpypl22,1589031339.0,"Yeah it is. These woman are older now but they pop out babies as if it's a new trend and get paid $60,000.00 an episode just to pop out kids. It's crazy what kind of world we live in."
antinatalism,fpxtjh7,t3_gg3jo6,1588989278.0,I wish I could tell my mom that she should have aborted me but I know that would just anger and upset her. Life is indeed awful with all the bad things going on in life especially for minorities. I don't know why anyone in their right mind would want to bring a child into this shitshow.
antinatalism,fpxi8oc,t3_gfzscy,1588983121.0,I dare someone to post this on FB! Breeders would have a fit if they saw this lol.
antinatalism,fpx155f,t1_fpx0by8,1588973696.0,If I told my parents that they would flip but I've been tempted to tell my mom she should have just aborted me.
antinatalism,fpwqdxm,t1_fpvtsvz,1588968056.0,See that is common sense but unfortunately a lot of people lack common sense.
antinatalism,fpteiqz,t1_fpsueov,1588889791.0,I'm ashamed I know her too. She is trash.
antinatalism,fprya35,t1_fpmsua3,1588864302.0,I agree. I can only handle dealing with my sister in small doses too. I love her but damn she can irritate me.
antinatalism,fprgxie,t1_fpql33w,1588853844.0,Yeah I agree. I hear a lot of people saying if God gave me this child then I'm going to keep them regardless of what that person's condition is in or what kind of life they would bring their child into.
antinatalism,fpqajd0,t1_fpbky34,1588818541.0,If you have kids why are you on this sub?
antinatalism,fpq9or7,t3_gc5bgj,1588818023.0,I don't feel sorry for her. She chose to have kids. If she didn't realize how hard it would be to raise kids then that is on her naive ass. What did she think would happen? That raising kids would be  walk in the park?
antinatalism,fpq8x0t,t3_gcqljg,1588817560.0,Having children past 36 is selfish as fuck.
antinatalism,fpq7nhk,t1_fpbc942,1588816808.0,and yet she willingly brought them into it smh.
antinatalism,fpq7kqt,t1_fpbfgvr,1588816763.0,I was thinking the same thing lol
antinatalism,fpq6vxn,t1_fpj1sr1,1588816369.0,Sadly many people think climate change is a myth brought on by liberals :/
antinatalism,fpq6ptc,t1_fpjbjp9,1588816273.0,Hmm that's a good point. At least if they find out later they can enjoy their fantasy delusion until a bucket of cold water hits them in the face.
antinatalism,fpq3amo,t3_gcoiqh,1588814312.0,"Lol you should see my post. There is an actually show dedicated to teen moms that get paid $60,000.00 an episode. It's disgusting."
antinatalism,fpq28dc,t3_gcpiip,1588813709.0,"This is absolutely disgusting. People that brag about that shit are truly trash. You should see the show Teen Mom. These girls under the age of 30 are popping out three to four kids and some of them have two to three baby daddies and yet they have fans and people that idolize them and are making 60,000 an EPISODE. It's fucking disgusting what kind of world we live in."
antinatalism,fpq1da9,t1_fpq0ksz,1588813222.0,I think some parents just want children because they look so cute as babies and young kids but like you said they forget that those cute kids turn into adults. Which is why I think a lot of parents  say they have that baby fever and decide to have another child when their children are older just so they can have that cute kid again. It's just a dumb mentality honestly.
antinatalism,fpq12iu,t1_fpq0q7o,1588813053.0,Wow...I'm sorry. It amazes me that people have that kind of thinking.
antinatalism,fpq0uhk,t1_fppzcsu,1588812925.0,I would say it's definitely a lot of the second one. I told my friends I never want kids and they looked at me like I told them I discovered I was a horse.
antinatalism,fpq0e25,t1_fph3zdq,1588812671.0,Not to mention cruel
antinatalism,fpq0bqw,t3_gcupkv,1588812635.0,This woman on this popular show Teen Mom OG (Yes I watch that garbage. Not sure why though) mom died and has three kids (She is under the age of 28) said she didn't want her kids to go through the pain of losing a parent like she had to go through with losing her mom but does't she realize her kids will more than likely have to suffer when she dies? I guess people don't look at things analytically.
antinatalism,fppzi0d,t3_gcjfdk,1588812174.0,I actually had an interview with this guy today and told me he found out his wife was pregnant. All I said was congrats because of course I wasn't going to tell him how I really felt.
antinatalism,fppz72t,t1_fpdlcls,1588812007.0,I have been asking that question for many years. I even ask people to this day what they think the meaning of life is and I continue to get various answers.

antinatalism,fppy1gs,t1_fpf46zu,1588811365.0,Geez when you say it like that it sounds awful but God didn't bring on the suffering. At least that is what I've been told.
antinatalism,fppx62y,t1_fphzydu,1588810881.0,My dad was always honest and always lets me know if I ever have kids make sure I have the money to provide for them.
antinatalism,fpptwp0,t3_gdurth,1588809073.0,I would love to tell my mom that she should have aborted me but I don't want to make her angry or upset her because we do have a very close relationship.
antinatalism,fppt574,t1_fppsaim,1588808642.0,Yeah I agree. I have even had friends tell me that I don't know what life my child would face when I try to explain to them why I wouldn't want to bring a child into this world. They always say life is a gift....and they may end up having a great life....blah blah blah. I remember when my Grandmother died and it was extremely painful. I know if my parents died I would feel much worst. I would feel awful to willingly produce children knowing they will go through that pain too.
antinatalism,fppsoca,t1_fpprrzi,1588808384.0,I hear that a lot too. My parents are always telling me that I should be grateful that I'm here. Bullshit. I didn't ask to be here and didn't want to be here. If I had the choice to decide if I want to be in this life knowing what this world is like I definitely would decline.
antinatalism,fpprm0j,t3_gemcdp,1588807805.0,I think some of it is pure laziness while it also could be someone just wants their child to have a unique name that no one else has. I do think celebrities give their children the most weirdest names though.
antinatalism,fpprd2r,t1_fpnmo3u,1588807668.0,I didn't know that was legal. What country do you live in?

childfree,fpo4eij,t1_fpnyls9,1588778174.0,"But why purposely decide to have a child if you can only help them with government assistance? When I think of poor I'm not talking about someone that can't afford living in the ritz or having steak every night. I'm talking about someone that can't afford to have a roof over their head or money to buy their kids food or clothes. If someone can provide for their child by buying them food, clothes and shelter without having to rely on a handout because they don't have the money themselves then that is different."

childfree,fpnxmw7,t1_fpnsus3,1588774625.0,I see where you are coming from but I think if you are already homeless and trying to have a baby it's not good to put a child through that. Babies need love but they need to be provided for too. Just love and affection don't pay the bills.
childfree,fpnwzo1,t1_fpnpi01,1588774270.0,It's amazing how much stupidity there is in the world. If I was her mom I would kick her out if she decided to have a third child and tell her I'm not going to be responsible for your dumb decisions. She would find out the hard way.
