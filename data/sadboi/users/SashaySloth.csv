I didn‚Äôt really feel any explicit racism in my time being raised here but it definitely is not the most inclusive place I‚Äôve been to or near the top. 

But the recent Naperville News moments have been really disappointing in this area. Guess I expected/assumed better from my own experience."

depression,fh5fgju,t3_f1djgl,1581288493.0,"Friend and I talked about how we had a longing for the feeling of sadness despite it being miserable in the moment and such. 

Like a weird kinda nostalgic sentiment? Don't even know how to describe the feeling. 


I think it's the self affirmation bias. 

By looking at the world through that lense of sadness, it allows our world view to explain nuances and complications through the warped prism of the emotion sadness. The emotion helps to explain reality because perception is reality. 

But if you try to be more objective and less emotional, there's less to grasp on and more of a sense of internal chaos and confusion. There's no cornerstone emotion to latch onto when explaining the details of life. 

When sad, the self affirmation bias helps to further incentivize the prism of sadness. BUT you are blinded bexauee a lack of objectivity, but it gives you more of a concrete internal thing to hold onto. 

I think? Idk"

AskReddit,fcy8kj5,t3_ejdlbw,1578076341.0,"I went off to college last year. The tail end of my high school was marred with relationship problems and family drama. I was so detached from my life in the college transition that I searched, applied and accepted my admission over three days with limited seriousness. I was also beginning to self-harm at this time. It was pretty fucked.

I was depressed. Being sent off to college led me to a suicide attempt about 2 months in. I took 90 Advil and ended up going through the looney bin.

I did not really know what to expect after waking up in a padded hospital room. But, I received a wave of support and love from my friends. It was awesome and helpful.

But soon enough, my friends decided to play therapist. My Ex-Best Friend ended up going to my other closest friends and inquiring information about me. He inevitably ended up attached to my ex-girlfriend because of this dynamic. Plus, my ex-girlfriend was well liked by my friends and maintained a presence in our friend group. After his inquiry into figuring out what is wrong with me, he came to the conclusion that I ""victimized myself"" of my problems. He told his opinion, and I initially was open to criticism. But the more and more I thought about it, the statement had a thick veneer of condescension to it. After I mulled over his opinion, I turned livid. I felt like my ex-girlfriend had taken her warped perspective on me and the relationship, and fed it to my best friend. And it seemed like he bought it.

In reality, it was a whole lot of miscommunication I reckon. After some clarification, I realized my friend was trying to iterate the reality that sometimes your problems aren't always created by us, but rather our responsibility to deal with them. But if someone victimizes themselves during this thought process, then they can be paralyzed in victimhood instead of lunging towards responsibility.

Beyond that, I got fucking mad and sent my ex-best friend and ex-gf a huge ranting text. They never responded, and the friendship fractured. I was able to be cordial with him in real life and I wanted to repair the friendship. There were so many factors beyond just this singular problem that inhibited my ability to connect or even be a human, and it did not help me be friends with him.

Long story short, my ex-best friend ended up dating ex-gf after a year. Doesn't sound too bad but it's a little annoying that she's willing to espouse how freely she does not want to interact with me, but has cancerously attached to my friend group like a super AIDS tumor. Plus that relationship was my first love, and it really really really really fucked with my head. I do not have great taste in women.

Once I found out they were fucking/dating, I confronted my ex-best friend. That confrontation quickly ended our friendship.

I spent months wanting to fucking impale both of them on a stake while dropping them off in the middle of the Pacific somewhere to drown in isolation. Or to burn them alive like a buddhist monk protesting against something.

Nowadays, I don't catch myself thinking about it nearly as much as I used to. They're just not worth my time. Maybe they are, but the miscommunication/emotional stupidity from my friends interpretation of my mental health problems flipped us against each other.

So yeah, I guess the moral of the story is to pick your friends carefully and to be very VERY VERY clear with your words. Jesus fuck.

&#x200B;

EDIT: In answering the question, i've never more quickly break-neck changed an opinion about anyone until I found out they were fucking. Spent months of my leisure time imagining gutting them open."
AskReddit,f3u1se3,t1_f3t14jq,1571151105.0,"We've been so busy raising awareness about the existence and prevelance of mental health, that it feels like more and more people have this misconstrued idea that they and a solid group of friends can do the job of a therapist. 

Sadly, no amount of attempted friend intervention helped me in my deepest recesses of depression. If anything, their attempt to help me backfired and strained the relationship. My friend who only listened intently and gave me a ear ended up being the most understanding and genuinely helpful. 

Same has happened to me. Where I've tried to help a mentally ill person, and all it did was stress the situation. It fucking sucks to feel helpless and watch, but the best we can do is to nudge them into proper channels who can hopefully help. Inadvertantly, I became too emotionally involved in helping her out and fell into my own little chaos. 


Take care of yourselves people!"
