AmItheAsshole,exweyx6,t1_exwcasx,1566618473.0,This is actually a really good point lmao i didn’t even consider that. We weren’t able to talk a lot today because I was super busy but we facetimed for a bit and by the looks of it there’s no way to reduce the cost significantly and i think he’s expecting me to pay. I’ll laugh so hard if i just misread his text and got reddit involved for no reason lmaooo i’ll keep y’all updated
AmItheAsshole,exvsbs5,t1_exve2kr,1566605607.0,"Good idea, thank you!"
AmItheAsshole,exvbgjc,t1_extk2by,1566596284.0,"Agreed, thank you! :)"

AmItheAsshole,exv8u9z,t1_exv6oj1,1566594792.0,I included that in my first edit :)
AmItheAsshole,exv2qz6,t1_exv16p0,1566591683.0,Well the thing he said to my dad was when they were kidding around so I'm not 1000% sure it was genuine and he said the thing about the hotel a whileeee ago so I decided to take both statements with a grain of salt. Believe what you'd like! :)
AmItheAsshole,exuz5y4,t1_exuyzp2,1566590208.0,Fair point but he did tell my dad that he was flying me out lol
AmItheAsshole,exuxnx7,t1_extn5l0,1566589649.0,Thank you! You're a life saver! :)
AmItheAsshole,exuxek9,t1_exursk0,1566589548.0,"I got his text about needing to go over prices as soon as I woke up and wrote my post in a hurry before work. I then saw all the feedback I was getting and realized I left out crucial information and needed to provide specific examples of him ""never implying that I would be helping pay for any of those things"" - a statement that was included in the original post"
AmItheAsshole,exuvuwg,t1_exuvipj,1566588976.0,Fair point :)
AmItheAsshole,exutsla,t1_exusszi,1566588269.0,Yeah I think that's pretty reasonable
AmItheAsshole,exutil6,t1_extjkrr,1566588178.0,"Fair points. I like your last idea about payment! 

I am Cinderella tho :)"
AmItheAsshole,exut875,t1_extnoqb,1566588071.0,That's what I've always lived by! Thanks for making me not feel crazy :)

AmItheAsshole,exusxga,t1_exumtw7,1566587961.0,"Typically I wouldn't just expect someone to pay for all of that stuff either, but based on his comments he really implied that he was going to"
AmItheAsshole,exusp55,t1_exugz8f,1566587881.0,"Lmao fair point, meant basics as in the basic things we need to actually physically attend the ball like a ticket and a place to stay lol"
AmItheAsshole,exusifs,t1_exufvlv,1566587814.0,See that's what I was taught growing up! I was always told that if someone invites you somewhere then they are responsible for paying for it…especially if it's one of the first dates…submitted to this sub to see if what I was taught was actually correct lmao
AmItheAsshole,exus7xg,t1_exu3la1,1566587708.0,Excellent points to take into consideration :)
AmItheAsshole,exurujv,t1_extzein,1566587572.0,Might go this route

AmItheAsshole,exurqxy,t1_extw4av,1566587533.0,"I fully agree with this, I have a feeling that's exactly what happened. Probably all sounded like nice gestures to be saying but at the end of the day when it was all added up turned out to not be realistic at all.

Hopefully we can work to find cheaper alternatives to things and find a way to pay for it together"
AmItheAsshole,exur22o,t1_exu145b,1566587304.0,"Based on his comments, to me it was clear he was intending on paying for everything

Stupid of me to assume? Probably. Did he give me every right to assume? Yeah.

Also never expected him to pay for my dress! :)"
AmItheAsshole,exuqose,t1_ext3rh4,1566587183.0,Totally agree :)
AmItheAsshole,exuqlxu,t1_extyhj9,1566587160.0,I see your side here. Wouldn't normally expect all of that to be paid for but based on his comments it really looked like he was okay with doing that.
AmItheAsshole,exuqbs6,t1_ext3q0g,1566587061.0,"I think it's more expensive this time around because of the event

Lots of good points and things to consider here :)"
AmItheAsshole,ext6aks,t1_ext5ifd,1566563457.0,Fair point and typically I would agree with you. If you look at my edit though he did say some things that really made it look like he was paying and that he was okay with it. Still my bad at the end of the day for assuming
depression,ex11nqb,t3_cqqe91,1565927950.0,"This is so great, congrats!! I use school as my number one distraction against depression and somehow despite my struggles I've managed to keep a 4.0. Every time I feel the depression about to hit I force myself to drive to the library and study to distract myself from my thoughts until the place closes. Try and find a way to channel all the negativity and turn it into something else if you can :)

So proud of you and best of luck!! <3"

piercing,ewi93yj,t1_ewi61ib,1565442883.0,Im shocked that everyone is saying to go for another nostril! I honestly just might now - plus that gives me an excuse to get another piercing since this ear is pretty mad at me rn

piercing,ewheix4,t3_co8471,1565405651.0,"got mine done about 2 months ago and absolutely love them!

1. not hard at all! just shower regularly and use saline spray every now and then and you're golden
2. totally depends! I opted for bralettes for the first couple of weeks and slept in a sports bra
3. okay mine are too lmao and the piercings make me feel way more confident since I feel like they kind of serve as a distraction :)"
piercing,ewhe1ub,t3_co59b2,1565405253.0,omg it looks so good!! so jealous of your hair btw
piercing,ewh4fy6,t3_cnupv1,1565397602.0,I've had mine for about a month now and it's doing great. Got it done at the same time as my helix and it hurt way less and is healing a hell of a lot better. My best piece of advice is honestly to just leave it the hell alone. I clean mine once a day after I shower and avoid sleeping on that side and so far it hasn't given me any problems! Totally worth it imo!
