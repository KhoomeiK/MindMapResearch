Better yet go see my free endocrinologist who can write me a script for free and pay $5 per insulin type/syringes/pen needles and test strips for a 3 month supply. Seriously never considering moving to any countries that dont subsidise this. I'm not trying to brag, just wish there was more that could be done from this side of the world because I couldn't imagine a life where I had to choose rent or insulin"
diabetes,f4zh405,t3_dm723b,1571906995.0,Oh this is totally something to be proud of! Your dedication definitely paid off. Well done friend!
diabetes,f4kcksj,t1_f4k2dxl,1571645807.0,"This is the most beautiful reply.  I love that you're working with kids who have it and that things have changed that meant you can do something you've dreamed of! I'm in NZ and we have some amazing kids programmes I grew up being a part of and hope that OP is in a place in the world that offers something similar. Getting to know kids his age who also go through our struggles makes such a difference. (Did for me). You know what else did? Having a mum who always cared enough to go through the struggles with me as best she could, learnt ad much as she could and was there for every hospital visit, shit tantrum, blood test...the list goes on. 

Hes right, you wont ever quite get it the way we do and I'm always glad for people who don't. (I mean this in the most wholesome way where I dont wish this upon anyone)  But god damn I appreciate my mumma so much for being the one who held my hand through all the shit times and celebrated the good with me (even 22 years later)

Keep being there for him and make sure you look after yourself too. He needs you to look after yourself as much as you do him."

I wish she'd left him earlier but I was old enough to get it by the time she did, more than a few years younger than your kids."

My nan meant well but in reality it's due to my chronic illness medication and lack of being able to train. Even more upsetting as I qualified as a personal trainer a month before being hospitalized and diagnosed. 

Thanks nan I knew you meant well because I looked 'happier' but god damn it hurt my already declining self esteem."
AskReddit,f3p495t,t1_f3m7zl7,1571042667.0,Is it an option to go study it now? If so I'd say follow your heart. Most interesting subjects and degree. Congrats on the killer grade friend!
