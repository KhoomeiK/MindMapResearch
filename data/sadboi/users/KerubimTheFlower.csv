DnD,fhdasea,t1_fhda2w3,1581481207.0,"Mainly to role-play more. I took it as a chance to do more stuff like voice acting and singing. I like singing but when it came to in game. Most of the players would attack before our bards could speak. My character is a dopey wood elf with high charisma. I really wanted to be chatty but there was a lot of conflict,  then the whole turn taking,  I legit feel like its me just not being outspoken enough to some degree."
DnD,fhd9dz1,t1_fhcxnv8,1581480263.0,"I bought a manual last week, but I had to download DM manual. I tried taking to the DM about everything, including how they treat me. They told me they had anxiety issues and didn't like confrontation but wouldn't ghost me anymore. I haven't heard from them since that conversation and I reached out to the twice. There more interested in getting attention for their homebrew and looks. Its going to take a few months, I bought a journal to write down stats, and homemade classes and stuff but its going to take a while. I just really want to play again and with my friends."
DnD,fhd8hn4,t1_fhd39j9,1581479668.0,"- Most people don't sit and read it cover-to-cover, but they do look up info relevant to their characters. Roll a rogue and research sneak rules, unseen attackers, and expertise. Roll a wizard and look into spells, ritual casting, and spell scrolls.

I do read the manual. I read it everytime i have to make a new character. They would use apps, I was comfortable with books but I made sheets and wrote down my stats whenever they changed. I kept up as much as I could.

- I wonder if and how you contribute in social situations. You're a bard after all. That should be your bread-and-butter. Jack-of-all-trades means in pretty much any situation you can contribute to some level. Do you?

In this camp there was another bard already, the Dm at the time made us take turns in talking. I read the rules again recently because im reading the player manual front to back , out of combat im allowed to speak out of turn. I just needed to speak up more and there were times when I did and was ignored by the players the Dm is familiar with.


-If it travels with you between groups, then there is some issue relating to you.

I definitely agree, I asked how I could improve and followed reddit boards to learn more creative ways of building my character.  I wasnt told if we were doing a homebrew or what. I don't want to sell them short I did have more to learn but I was reading,writing, and drawing what I thought was okay. 

- All that said, homebrew is great but I'd be concerned if you're a good fit as a Dm.

Im reading the player manual front to back, and hope to be finished in a few months. I felt horrible and my friends don't have a DM to play with. Im like the only person that does understand dnd enough to pass what I know to my friends, I also will have the books to share with my friends so they can keep up to."

Game sense is really important and I try to stress it to my Elo. watching coaches, and paying attention to different play styles, and team comp, improved my skill drastically, I’m in the Elo I wanted to be in since season 1. So it’s important to try and keep up with what’s happening on the developers side, I make mistakes but it’s why I watch the coaches, I stress my team when I can tell we’re too far on a map. It’s just helpful knowing these things, because I noticed when playing league you have a better knowledge of game mechanics because of how the game has changed over the past decade.

I do think you have personality, people aren’t good for us no matter how they make us feel sometimes. You don’t need someone who sees you cling and shuns you. You do have to learn to stop that though, you’re going to hurt yourself even more by letting yourself willingly be influenced by a few kind gestures. We can all work on our self esteem and it’s why there’s hope in your situation. No one is perfect and you have the opportunity to grow and really flourish from this. Growing hurts, but after the pain you feel so so much better and I know you’re strong enough to say no.

You’re strong enough to stop letting this happen and keep letting yourself feel used, you’re worth the growth and pain that comes with loving someone, I just hope that you’re patient to let it grow within you first. You’re not any of the terrible nasty things you tell yourself and just because people make you feel down, doesn’t mean you’re not something precious."
