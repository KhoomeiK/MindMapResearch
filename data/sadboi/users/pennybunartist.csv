 a deity means is a higher power, some force that, while existing on a different plane has the ability to affect:influence our plane of existence.

Paganism helps me to appreciate beauty because through that lens I am able see things as full of life and energy that is ever present and ever connected.

>How so?

Ok so, please keep in mind that I write like a dumbass with a flair for the dramatic. (Also I‚Äôm not trying to convert anyone with this, this is just my personal experience) 

Even before I started practicing paganism I loved nature, but after I started practicing, I was able to see things in a new way. This new way was to see the value in everything, every part of nature was important. I stopped killing spiders, I wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore, I saw them as fellow inhabitants of the earth, not lesser beings ((something catholisim  ‚Äútaught‚Äù me)) . I started my pagan journey through Druidism, the basic principles of which are really just good life advice and morals (imo) 

Our main pursuits as Druids:
Love: spread love kindness and understanding to everyone and everything you encounter. Love the earth and all parts of earth. 
knowledge: learn everything you can about the world, study! Learn, be willing to listen and to admit that you don‚Äôt know something, you are never done learning. 
Wisdom: learn from your mistakes and from others, think about things from all perspectives, not just your own.

Paganism encourages learning about the world around you, it makes the science behind life seem so beautiful. 
The soul of the world is strong, and it helps me feel connected with everything when I practice paganism. I‚Äôm sending my energies out into the world, i‚Äôm cleansing and easing my mind. 

It helps me not feel lonely, Even if i‚Äôm at a distance from everyone I know I still have this connection with the earth and that the same energy runs through all of us.

My deities are not perfect & they do not damn you to eternal suffering if you don‚Äôt believe in them, they reach out, but they respect if you don‚Äôt want to work with them.  Paganism is very much about empowering yourself and finding your own purpose in the web of life. I don‚Äôt worship my deities unconditionally, I work With them they are more experienced and well lived than I will ever be. That is why we call them our Matrons or Patrons, they are like a guiding hand for whatever it is you wish to pursue. We understand that they can‚Äôt do everything for us, and that our own efforts will ultimately help us the most. Venus gives me motivation to pursue those things I wish to manifest in my own life. 

> What makes you believe this nonsense?

Personal experiences and the beauty of the universe.

> Care to provide evidence for this belief?

I think it would be considered almost arrogant to believe that in this vast universe of ours that we are the only intelligent beings. Can you really say with confidence that there is Nothing out there? Everyday science is allowing us to find out more and more about our universe. Scientists are finally able to study animal cognitions and explore the complexities of our own planet‚Äôs beings in a way that we hadn‚Äôt been able to before ((I highly suggest the book ‚Äúanimal wise‚Äù by Virginia Morrell, it explores a multitude of experiments, studies, and just how the science is progressing in this modern world in general when it comes to the idea of animal cognition‚Äù )"

>Also, I'm not too concerned with whether you think I'm an asshole for criticizing any given faith.

It wasn‚Äôt meant to be seen as a literal example I use quotation marks weird and didn‚Äôt even realize people would think it was a legit quote, so thats my bad ((I‚Äôve clarified in the original post now

>Again...your own given example didn't include anyone calling pagan faiths ""primitive,"" so I'm not sure what you're on about, and I'm not sure why you think we should exclude those mythologies from others when discussing...mythologies.

Again, it wasn‚Äôt a literal example.

>But maybe this will help get us on track. I will happily call pagan faiths ""primitive,"" along with all of the ""big faiths"" as well. I think most religions and mythological faiths are primitive attempts by humans to make sense of the universe.

Thats the track! I don‚Äôt mind if you think all religions are bs 
That has nothing to do with ""centuries of mass crusades, propaganda, blah blah blah"" or whatever. It has to do with my personal view of religious / superstitious beliefs.


>I seriously can't follow this post at all, and I'm sorry but I have no reason to treat your superstitious beliefs any differently than any other superstitious beliefs -- not until somebody somewhere can give any kind of convincing evidence that their superstitious beliefs are actually true.

I‚Äôm not asking for it to be treated differently as if it was some sort of ‚Äúexception‚Äù I want it to be treated with the same amount of suspicion and criticism that any other faith would receive.  

>In the meantime, they all seem like mythologies, and they all seem like primitive attempts to explain the universe.

Ok cool, that‚Äôs totally fine if you believe that. 

>Don't care. Never said you were evil, and the example you provided didn't either.
 
Thanks for not saying I was evil, And again, it wasn‚Äôt a real quote. 

>It turns out your personal feelings of sadness when your superstitious beliefs are criticized don't really affect whether or not I think they deserve criticism.

Nope, I just got sad and confused because I thought that the atheists here (for some reason) thought that paganism was inherently more stupid and unrealistic than any monotheistic faith. 

>‚ÄùDon't do some very specific thing that I apparently can't even give a coherent example when criticizing my chosen superstitious belief because other people have criticized it too?"" Is that it?

Nope ‚Äú criticize my faith all you want but do it in the same way that you criticize other faiths, unless it is a pagan-specific thing you are criticizing then feel free to go all out lol.‚Äù

> Why? Some pagan mythology calls for sacrifice. Human and/or animal. None have any basis is reality, none have any evidence, many have ridiculous superstitious claims that have proven false. Why is it a dick move to call them primitive? It seems like, given your flair, you have taken a  personal offence at absurd beliefs being called absurd because you believe in them.

Okay so, many pagan faiths, and by that I mean the VAST majority of pagans do not sacrifice living things. That wasn‚Äôt nearly common as most people are lead to believe it is. A lot of the accounts of this Either come from christian propaganda that we were evil (this helped the crusaders to be supported)
Some wrote about how the Druids were ‚Äúcannibals‚Äù others told tall tales that they would ‚Äústuff people into a large brass figure of a man and light it on fire for their demon gods.‚Äù And other dramatic bs like that. (There is no archeological evidence that any of the druids were cannibals or that this freaky statue thing ever even existed.) 
One of the main principles of modern paganism  is a respect for the lives of all kinds of beings.

I should clarify, ‚Äúonly calling paganism and not other faiths primitive and uncivilized is an asshole move because by targeting only a specific faith you are implying that you think that other theist faiths are higher‚Äù and I thought that, for atheists at least, that would be an odd thing to believe.

>You are not evil. No one said you were, at least not anyone in the 20th century with more than a 4th grade education. As for what you ""faith"" is based on, its irrelevant. Faith is still a terrible path to truth. It's still a reliable path to woo.

Thanks for not thinking I‚Äôm evil, but Many pagans have been called evil, fucked up, devil worshippers (even though we don‚Äôt believe in the devil typically, thats a christian thing), monsters, freaks, disturbed, and a whole slew of other insults and hateful things.

I have not gone to church for many years.
I do not have family that I need to attend mass with.
I am not a part of anything christian community.

I just feel disgusted with the fact that I was indoctrinated into a faith without my own consent. It feels wrong, It feels dirty, I hate it so so much. It makes me feel sick.

I hate that I still have the anxiety instilled in me as an extremely young child that ‚Äúif you aren‚Äôt a Christian, you‚Äôre going to hell.‚Äù I have never truly believed any of it, but the effects of constant sermons and christians telling me that I would go to hell remains in the back of my mind.

The threatening eternal suffering is to a child is an awful thing to. And it has bad side effects."

The only things I‚Äôve found so far that guarantee that you will be excommunicated is to #1 punch the pope or #2 kill someone, and I won‚Äôt do either of those things, so rip lol.

I wonder if I could ask the pope if I could punch him tho... I‚Äôd be fine if I had his consent :0!"

Does evolution have to be beneficial? I know some viruses mutate themselves basically out of existence. 

Perhaps I could have two sets of eyes? One that opens at night and closed during the day and vice versa?"

Either way, they love to descend onto my bird feeders, clean them all out, and yell to each other so loud i can hear it from inside my house.
There are so many that when they all take off together the sound of their wings is LOUD ‚ÄúFWOOMP‚Äù it‚Äôs a crazy experience.

Very pretty birds, but they can be bullies and are very rude guests, never leaving anything behind or thanking the host."

But to respond to your comment, I think ‚Äúuniqueness‚Äù is what makes us human, everyone is unique in their own way and I think that is beautiful. Also, we are all going to die someday, so why not have fun with our lives? 
I hope you are able to stay true to yourself in a way that makes you feel genuinely happy.

I don‚Äôt love attention, sure, sometimes I want attention, as most humans do, but attention is not my main goal.

My main goal is to be myself and to just DO things I think would be fun, rather than just sitting around wishing I could do those things and not get judged for them. Ex: I cut my hair as a child because it was annoying to maintain, I love the color green, so, I dyed my hair my favorite color!
I wear clothes and do things that make me happy!
