Anxiety,fp7m89x,t3_gbnjuv,1588373290.0,"I can relate to this. As the restrictions slowly started lifting I started to panic again. My home is my comfort zone, I understand why people hated quarantine itself, but I loved the idea that I didn’t have to see people everyday or barely sleep. It all comes to an end though and we will have to return to what is waiting for us. Good luck I hope everything goes smoothly:)"
