I would suggest starting somewhere, they don't read the clock so you don't have to be precise but at least in the mornings and in the evenings try to take him out roughly at the same time (for example if you are trying to set 9pm for his evening walk it doesn't matter if you go out even at 10pm just try to keep it as close as possible). Maybe just walking a short distance but again try to keep it consistent. 

Do not take him back as soon as he has done his business or he will learn to hold it in order to make the walks longer. Again set a path and he will learn to do his business correctly. 

I know it's hard but maybe try to set some alarms? The puppy stage is the hardest one when he grows up is going to be easier.

Talk to him and reward him when he behaves correctly try to do that as much as possible when he his a puppy."

Always leave toys laying around for him. Try to set his walks, like everyday the same amount of times (3 times is optimal) at the same hour and every walk should have its own path. For example if you need to go early to work in the morning find a short walk that you can do every day, find one for midday and one for the evenings. Dogs are creatures of habit they love when they have a routine and it makes them relax. I guess you already doing it but just to be sure: you have to walk your dog even if it rains, it sucks but you have to. And if you are alone in taking care of him even if you are sick sadly. 

Do not yell at him if he has already done something wrong.
Dogs are not that smart if you don't catch him in the act he won't understand and he'll only be scared of you yelling. 
 
Do not make him do anything he won't be allowed to do when he becomes an adult. If you do not want him to sleep on the bed when grows up do not let him sleep on it now. I know the are cute but it will be hard near impossible to un-teach him.

If you are already training him you are on a good path! Just keep doing it until he is a little bit older. 
If you have any question feel free to ask!"

HO perso il conto di quante volte ha scoperto chi è stato a creare il virus perché a quanto pare non si è mai sentito di un virus che muta naturalmente. Si va dagli Americani che stanno sbarcando in Italia, francesi che non vogliono che collaboriamo con la Cina ma anche i tedeschi voglio il controllo dell'Europa. Audio e messaggi su Whatsapp assurdi di persone che si improvvisano divulgatori scientifici che non sanno la differenza tra virus e batteri.

C'è chi sostiene che, quoto, ''gli zuccheri e carboidrati sono nutrimento per tutte le malattie quindi basta toglierli dalla dieta e non si ha bisogno di aver paura'' e non bisogna avere paura perché c'è chi addirittura dice che basta provare emozioni positive perché i virus non possono  sintonizzarsi su emozioni felici e quindi non possono attecchire nel nostro corpo. Basta l'amore a respingerli e una lunga passeggiata ma ci vogliono impedire di farle! (perché il governo vuole far chiudere i piccoli e medi imprenditori e voi non ve ne accorgete!).

Quando il ragazzo si allontana, nemmeno poi tanto, l'impiegata si lascia andare ad una serie di commenti razzisti con il collega accanto. Peccato che non era il mio turno, mi sarebbe piaciuto risponderle.
Sei fortunata se non hai mai assistito a eventi simili dove vivi, come ti ho vista scrivere in altri commenti, purtroppo però l'Italia ha un fondamentale problema con il razzismo. Negarlo è inutile e dannoso, basta andare a leggere dei dati per averne conferma. 
Che poi esitano molte persone estremamente gentili è un bene non una conferma che in Italia il fenomeno del razzismo non sia un problema."
goodmythicalmorning,fi39keh,t1_fi34zlv,1582107749.0,It's really hard for me to finish the episodes where Cotton Candy Randy it's featured. I can't point out why I dislike him so much...
OldSchoolCool,fi0f0qo,t3_f5iy6i,1582035377.0,My Italian grandmother almost got a ticket because she was wearing very (by their standards) short shorts and a tank top at the beach in the '50. She has this picture of her walking on the beach and  everyone is looking at her in a very judgmental way but she never cared.She used to be a very beautiful woman.

rhettandlink,fgs7qkm,t3_f0088e,1581075508.0,I watch both together if I have the time. IfI don't have time at lunch I will watch more during chores. Lately I have been enjoying GMMore more because they are more casual and relax. I have to admit that I didn't like mail with Jen and the one involving the crew. Nothing against them but it's not my cup of tea. I prefer the Vlogs over LTAT too.
PlayStationPlus,fgs7khh,t3_ezymh9,1581075307.0,Agree! I don't own a PS3 and joined PlayStation Plus in November (thanks black Friday sales!) and I am really enjoying it!
