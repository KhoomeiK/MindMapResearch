MrIglesias,fb5jvxw,t1_fb1sh0j,1576528999.0,"In the academic decathlon, you don't try to answer random questions faster than other people. You take normal tests with a pencil and scrantron and try to score more points than another team. It's timed but answering the questions faster doesn't matter; getting more questions answered correctly matters."
GodFriendedMe,fahwutz,t3_e85mii,1576095159.0,"I've always been annoyed by Cara. This time I'm wondering, wouldn't she be suffering anyways due to her step-dad's screw up? It's just a different, and legal, kind of suffering now that Miles is involved. Why not acknowledge that with or without Miles, life is still suffering. So if you love him as much as you claim, then don't leave him."
