I know you probably live an unhealthy lifestyle but go easy on yourself nobody is perfect. Try love. Love yourself for your imperfections. Love your cat or dog (if you have one). Love the shows you watch. Or go back to a simpler time and do the things you used to love. I know you can‚Äôt just change the way you think but you can change your behaviors which overtime will change the way you think. 

Just wanna leave you with the thought that people do care and your life does matter. It may seem like it doesn‚Äôt cause people rarely ever actually do anything to physically help you but that doesn‚Äôt mean that people don‚Äôt care about you. All in all people care!"

Also my ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù are that there have been time travelers who have talked to me over Xbox live/other consoles and who I‚Äôve seen (time travel is theoretically possible). The reason they‚Äôve come to visit me is to see what I‚Äôm actually like. I feel my phone is tapped and not the police or anything are listening but the time travelers are. The phone being tapped I‚Äôm on the fence whether is true or not. Also the reason they‚Äôve come visit me is because of the religion I‚Äôve created. I feel some of the time travelers have visited my friend before he passed away because he sacrificed himself and took his own life for an experiment for the religion.

Here goes nothing though what I would do is slowly change your actions. Like set a timer for 10 minutes a day doing something productive or if that‚Äôs to long right now 5 min or 2 min then slowly increase that. Your actions feed into your feelings and thoughts and your thoughts and feelings feed into your behavior. If that doesn‚Äôt work try medication to change ur thoughts. If that doesn‚Äôt work then continue down the path your on and you‚Äôll eventually hit a road block/bottom and be fed up with it. If your already there then you know what you need to do. As for the why it‚Äôs just how people get into habits of doing things. Why you think ur friends find you annoying is maybe cause your anxious about what you say and are overthinking things. 

Hope you get out of this rut. Stay strong!"

5. Reduce heat to low, medium low and continue cooking for 15-20 min.
