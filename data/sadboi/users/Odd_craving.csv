Chriswatts,fr1vabz,t3_glya25,1589826543.0,"I’ll answer this by explaining how my mother couldn’t truly love anyone. She was beyond abused and she was dragged from one foster home to another. She was abandoned, physically abused, sexually abused, and emotionally abused. 

When I look at CW’s mother, I see many of those same traits. CW’s mother is also a narcissist and delusional... my mother was neither. 

My mother was so crushed by her childhood that the best she could do was to mimic/approximate love. She did a great job and raised three boys. I realized early in that she didn’t “love” any of us, but she was fiercely protective and somewhat nurturing.  

I think CW never learned boundaries or how to interact with loved ones in a healthy way. This is why he just did what he was told and had a reputation as agreeable and a “nice guy.” 

Internally he was seething with rage. He sat on this rage until he couldn’t pretend to love or be good any longer. Because he really didn’t understand love or boundaries, he actually thought he could just reboot and start again. 

His mind is blank. No remorse, and no guilt. I read that he thinks that his dead family visiting him in his prison cell. This tells me that he doesn’t understand that, if alive, his family would be angry, and not wanting to visit him. 

He’s incapable of understanding how wrong his actions were,"

The wait list has different levels of seriousness, A being the top of the list. My transplant team was pretty hands off until I got really close to transplant. I expected them to be very attentive and checking in with me, but they were the opposite. The one thing you want to do is to stay as healthy as you can and DON’T GAIN WEIGHT unless you need to. Transplant teams don’t like it when you gain weight while waiting. 

I eventually needed to have an artificial heart because I was failing faster then a heart would be available. This was the scariest part of the whole process. The artificial heart gave me lots of problems, including a stroke. I recovered from the stroke, and got my new heart 11/1/14. 

The hospital part of the recovery was kind of a blur. I did pretty well and was released 16 days after the transplant.

The reality is that Oak Island was heavily used over the centuries by the different nations who had military interests there. That’s it. 

The heavy military presence caused all of the digging and structures. The other finds are from earlier treasure searchers. The complexity of the early (military) structures would never serve as any kind of treasure security. It makes zero sense to booby trap your own treasure with so much complexity.

You’re right that large groups of people can be wrong. But those things are simply (stand alone) unrelated facts. 

The history of the law and the behavior of people are all interesting things, but unless you can **tie these things directly to the DH case**, it’s just not relevant. The DH case, like every other case, is within its own bubble. Other things like lying witnesses and group-think can’t be considered in this case unless a relationship can be shown. 

If you could prove that a witness lied in the DH case, then you’d have an argument. If you could prove that the large group of people who think DH is guilty are wrong, then you’d have an argument. But you can’t just throw those unrelated things into a discussion as any kind of relevant matter to the DH case. 

Here an example; I get a speeding ticket and I choose to fight it. My court day comes and I represent myself and I make an opening statement. I tell the judge that it’s a known fact that police officers have lied in the past. I explain that radar guns have sometime been proven inaccurate, and therefore I’m innocent. This won’t work because my argument doesn’t consider the facts in my case. I simply made a statement of fact, not an argument. 

Evidence is evidence. Circumstantial and direct evidence are 100% valid in court. This case had both. Even if you don’t like the DNA evidence, it was there. Even if you don’t like the circumstantial evidence, it was there. Even if you don’t like the amount of evidence, it was there. 

Your entire argument is based on the fact that there are things about this case that you don’t like, and a few unrelated facts. You and I don’t get to throw out evidence because we think that there not enough, or because it’s only circumstantial. These things are still evidence."

**How is this not using the Bible to prove the Christian God?**

“*God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. 28 ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.*’""

“*Paul had no problem thinking that God was, in some way, working through Greek religion, with its dozens of gods*.“

You’re pointing to the Bible as a source for proving your (Bible-based) faith is true. This is the very definition of circular reasoning."

1) Don’t you think that any other religion would also be able to point to their internal text as proof if theirs being the only true faith? Any religious text would have writings that validate their religious claims.

2) You’ve used only circular sources to validate your position, which raises logical concerns about your position’s veracity. If there ever were a topic where using logical fallacies (circular reasoning) indicated a weak argument, this would be it. 

3) You don’t actually tackle the fact that other faiths feel just as strongly as you do that they are correct. All of these faiths have long histories of their beliefs being realized and proven. If it’s your position that other faiths are wrong, you’d need point to something."

DebateEvolution,fp5tssx,t3_gbcxoi,1588339742.0,"Several things in your post have me perplexed. 

1) Why have you placed an artificial time component to the understanding of how life was created? The fact that science hasn’t yet made every single inroad to this complex question doesn’t mean that it won’t or can’t.  It took centuries for science to begin to unravel the mysteries of germs. It would seem out of place for a person in 1640 to claim that science was suspect because it hasn’t figured out why people get sick and die. 

Then you have the secondary issue of one worldview that claims to know where life came from, but produces zero testable information, finding fault with a worldview that produces testable information and also acknowledges when something is unknown. 

2) “Survival of the Fittest” was a non-scientific phrase made by Economist Herbert Spencer after reading Darwin. It’s origins are found in Economic thinking of the mid 1900’s. Darwin never said or wrote this. [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest).

DebateAnAtheist,fp345kj,t3_gatf3u,1588272769.0,"While this post is accurate and truthful, it goes absolutely nowhere with the true believer because they already **know** that God did it. This is not open for discussion. Often, the only reason for a theist to engage in this kind of analytical argument is to either defend themselves or change the minds of atheists and agnostics. It’s not a teachable construct.

The theists I’ve engaged on this topic (u/wardsfor for example) have told me that the scientific proof of God’s involvement in everything (Big Bang and creation of life) is already there... we just don’t want to look at or acknowledge reality. What you and I see as a God of the Gaps fallacy is their evidence. It’s like a Chinese Finger trap of belief.

This is not a conversation based in logic as logic has long since left the building. The more rational and evidence-based you get, the more the theist digs in his/her heels. I’ve heard this phenomenon referred to as “Terror Management.” The terror is in the sudden realization that the theist has spent his/her whole life worshiping a magical fairy tale, and now their kids are worshiping this same fairy tale... so they manage this terror by entering yet a deeper belief. 

The more you upset the apple cart, the deeper the theist falls into his/her worldview. When you think about it, they kind of have to. Their entire life; financial, educational, marriage, relationships, parenting, time, and sometimes even their paychecks are completely tied to this believe system. 

None of this is based in logic."
