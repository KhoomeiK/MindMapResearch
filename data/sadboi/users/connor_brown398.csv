The important thing is you aren't alone, there are many people who feel the same as you and have went through similar things as you too. So don't worry, there are plenty on the same boat and all we can do is keep moving and hopefully, someday, it will get better.

depression,ep5bawx,t1_ep5as63,1559053230.0,"Like I'll say something maybe here or there but I'll never say anything too serious whilst there are others around because a lot of people who talk openly like that are attention seeking, and I don't want anyone thinking that I am. And very few people know about my issues because I feel like telling people who don't need to know is just stupid. Like I'll tell someone who asks or someone who needs to know, but I never say anything that people don't need to know about because I'd rather keep that private, my depression isn't something that I want everyone to know about, therefore I don't let people know about it. Even my closest friend rn doesn't even know, I deal with a lot of shit myself instead of openly. Last time I dealt with it openly I had an entire school turn against me for it because of people twisting my words and spreading rumours etc"
depression,ep5as63,t1_ep4ttxr,1559053030.0,"Well yeah that's basically what I'm saying. I don't think that it's wrong to talk openly, but I just think that with the stigma surrounding it it's best not too just because personally I don't want people thinking that I'm doing or saying stuff just to get attention. Therefore I don't talk about things like that in public just because I think it's a bad idea"
depression,ep4q1cx,t1_ep4jmxe,1559044010.0,"Yeah I'll talk about it online and stuff with no problems because it's an open problem. But in public is just too far imo. Like only a couple of my friends even know about my problems and I hide it from the rest, but the whole reason I think like that is because of the stigma surrounding it and that I want people to think I'm 'faking' it or doing it because it's 'cool'. I'll talk about it in private but I find that when I hear someone else talk about it in public I just think to myself ""it's so obvious they're saying that on purpose to try and sound cool"". That's just the way things are.
And yeah when gay people openly show that they're gay in public it annoys me because they're being ""extra"" on purpose just to grab attention - That's not in all cases but in a lot that I see."
depression,ep4fveo,t1_eozpsnl,1559039367.0,"Perfect reply. Although I disagree with the hole ""announcing"" point you made. I think it's great to talk about it and it is the best way to get things out. But ""announcing"" it and talking about it openly in public, especially when there are strangers etc. near isn't the best method imo. I find this to be attention seeking and one of the reasons that depression has a bad name. Because people who try to make it obvious on purpose are disgraceful and most likely faking it"

depression,eoin157,t1_eoimwj6,1558623202.0,And this is almost like a repetitive cycle thoughout days.

depression,eoimwj6,t3_brsy1y,1558623125.0,"Yeah 100% man.
