SuicideWatch,fkpz22h,t1_fir7r9i,1584424040.0,"God damn it. Do you know I was in love with somebody that felt exact same way? I‚Äôm so sad that he‚Äôs gone but I understand exactly how he feels it‚Äôs so hard to want to continue in life where you feel like nothing matters. But I promise things matter maybe I‚Äôm not on the sub.. maybe I‚Äôm not doing the right thing but I just want you to know things don‚Äôt end here. The world is in both of our hands we can end it at any point any second any moment‚Ä¶ But we deserve to show the world we are able to take a minute, breathe think about what you have because guess what this is all you have. And you are destined for so much more. So so so much more"

My parents insisted it was a joke but I never forgot about that."
Mediums,evupn5b,t1_evuphg4,1564802203.0,"I want to confirm he was not addicted to any drugs, however maybe there were things I didn‚Äôt know within our relationship. With many of you saying it I feel maybe there were struggles he hid from the world. That gives me peace only because I know I couldn‚Äôt do anything about something I wasn‚Äôt aware of. Thank you. He was very intelligent, and struggled with extreme ADHD. I‚Äôm not sure if he may had been misdiagnosed or something but his patterns were strong and regular. He was a very loving and giving person. I think he just didn‚Äôt know how to love himself."
