I live in Germany, where weed isn't legal and people are fighting over CBD products, but few people wonder about their alcohol consume - I call that hypocritical and dangerous af. When I lived in the Netherlands, my impression was that smoking weed is something that you do or you don't, as a Dutch person of age at least and I loved it (Please hear me out ;-)) It meant that the whole thing was completely de-mystified and no-one cared, no-one who needed it was prosecuted, no-one did it for the wrong reasons...

The worst case scenario here, spoken without feelings as an outsider, is: he's just not that into you, but would enjoy the aspects of contact with you that attract him and it just remains this loose affair, as long as you let him. I'm not saying he doesn't care for you, but is this what you want?"
ExNoContact,fjxmi22,t1_fjxlv7w,1583677949.0,"Stop it, then. Just. S. T. O. P. It's not heartless and you haven't missed the crucial ingredient to happiness with him. Do I need to bother Einstein about this? ""To do the same things and expect a different result is..?"" :-P"
ExNoContact,fjxmc3o,t1_fjxkvur,1583677819.0,"Trust yourself not trusting him. I mean, I haven't met either of you, there is just too much drama here all of a sudden, it sure sounds like sabotage. I mean, if I wanted someone to talk to me, I would try express myself in a way that showed my feelings, but didn't put them under too much pressure. ""I want to DIE holding your hand?"" I really don't know about that one. The fact he can't make the woman he wants to be with forever feel appreciated before she leaves also makes me suspicious, especially when you've been on and off several times... Andddd he didn't write those things two months ago. Andddd you mentioned how he mistreated you. Andddd he might be jealous. You know the guy. What does the bit of you that learns instead of melting say? ^^"
ExNoContact,fjxklfz,t1_fjxk4x7,1583676397.0,"Hey, how are you holding up now? I've read some posts here saying that goodbyes aren't the same as breaking nc, because they are more like setting boundaries and getting some closure. As long as he doesn't go like: ""I miss your so much, let's turn your last mail into this whole conversation, I'm never discarding you again, except when I am..."" as long as you listen to your gut and don't bite, you are on your way to feeling better. You can do this."
ExNoContact,fjuacka,t1_fju9qv7,1583615125.0,"Ugh. But then you'd be back with him only to find it's still a toxic mess. You are not doomed until you are, well, doomed. With no other option. You are living another option right now, though, so that can't be true. How is he still able to contact you to hoover? EDIT : It's getting late in Europe, but I'll be back on this thread tomorrow, Schwarzenegger-style. DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR EX, that's not who you are anymore, that's to both of us and the other fine people here. GN"
ExNoContact,fju93lq,t1_fju6af2,1583614844.0,"Sounds like a good plan. :-) Of course, your worries have to go somewhere if you don't want to tell New Guy the heavy stuff yet... I mean, I would feel the same way and if I didn't keep a diary and see my group, I'd explode or implode or something. You've covered all angles and learned a lot, by the sound of it... I'm rooting for you. :-) As for your ex, especially with someone new in your life, don't text him. You're not about to be in a polyamorous relationship with both of them, you can't be friends, certainly not now... Keep posting your messages here as long as you like or send me a PM, but don't let him back into your life now."
