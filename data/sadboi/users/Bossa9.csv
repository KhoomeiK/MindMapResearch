PokemonSwordAndShield,fqzmajj,t3_glssfz,1589770349.0,"I grew up playing Gen 1, 2, 3, and 5, and I took a break before picking up Sword. People who say the game is easy are usually ignoring the fact that Pokemon games have always been easy. The hardest parts of Gen 1 and 2 were figuring out where you had to go, and that‚Äôs hardly a feature lol

If a ‚Äòdifficult‚Äô fight in pokemon just means a high level fight with high power moves, then the ‚Äòchallenge‚Äô is grinding wild battles until your level is high enough. I think in SnS, the designers wanted to avoid that.

So the levels of enemy pokemon are relatively low. To counter that I just regularly switched out the pokemon in my party. I kept my starter the whole time but he was in the back, and only used in emergencies. That way I had a good chunk of the dex done before post-game, and a good mix of mons for fun teams.

Besides that, post-game has the battle-tower, which evens out all mons levels, and human comp if you really want to do that.

I‚Äôd suggest the game if you like the series, there‚Äôs a good variety of mons to choose from with more coming in the expansions, and the DLC guarantees support and content for probably the next 6 months, if not longer."

Stellaris,fqp7l21,t3_gk6eas,1589537872.0,"I‚Äôve found that closing the gap in power is usually achieved by technology, rather than pumping out a bunch of ships. Researching the next level of ship and pumping out a couple of them per squadron will usually double your fleet power, without requiring a huge command limit. 

Besides that, you can even the odds by doing a little recon. Organize a couple cheap suicide runs on the enemy to find out if they‚Äôre weaker to energy or kinetic weapons, and if you‚Äôll be better off building shields or armor. Also consider the range they fight at, and if they use missiles (so you know whether or not to bother with countermeasures). When your fleet is tooled specifically against your foe, you‚Äôll be able to punch up above your weight class

last idea‚Äîdo all that, and just defend. Find the chokepoints in your area that the enemy will have to go through, and beef up those starbases with a bunch of defense platforms. Then park your big fleet there, and the enemy will have to deal with your starbase as well, plus whatever nasty debuffs you‚Äôve loaded onto it. Let them break up their strongest fleets like that, then move in when you can overwhelm them :)"

You‚Äôve admitted yourself, in this post, that despite the furious pace that you drive, you‚Äôre still not reaching your goals. Probably you‚Äôve set up desires that would be difficult for any human to really match‚Äîlet alone with a manageable amount of stress.

For me, when I‚Äôm going crazy, to relax, to ‚Äòlet go‚Äô of that wild drive and find some contentment‚Äîeverything screams that that‚Äôs an awful idea, that I‚Äôll stagnate and nothing will get done like that. And at this point I know better and I make some mental space, and I don‚Äôt do anything, as a challenge to it. 

And things don‚Äôt fall apart! And I‚Äôm more productive. Not as productive as I dreamed, who knows if I‚Äôll ever be as good at anything as I want to be? But that‚Äôs never been a guarantee! And that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll do things when I want to, and things will be okay.
