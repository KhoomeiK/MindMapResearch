BPD,fm4b4ie,t3_fcrfpo,1585750590.0,THANK YOU. Ever since my diagnosis my bf has been using it as an excuse to invalidate my feelings and it’s like... are you blind? Every time he does something that upsets or hurts me I tell him and I make solid points that everyone and their mom would agree on and my reaction was completely valid but he always uses my BPD as an excuse that I’m overreacting and I’m not seeing the bigger picture. It’s so mentally and emotionally exhausting
