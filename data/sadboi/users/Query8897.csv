relationships,ficx7vw,t3_f7bo45,1582358904.0,"I was in a long distance relationship for 8 years. Got married and moved in together 2.5 years ago, so together almost 11 years. I credit part of our success on reading a bit of ""The art of Loving"" by Erich Fromm when I was a kid, it helped me learn a lot of what is important for a long-term relationship.

Your issue does feel at least partially like a commitment issue. Love is a choice more than a feeling, a choice you make every day, consciously or not, to wake up next to that person. Relationships take work and the concept of soulmates is the stupidest thing ever invented; no human relationship of any sort will be clean sailing, and the more intimate a relationship is, the more work it needs put into it for it to grow. When you're afraid of ""settling"", you're afraid of committing to the wrong person. And no one is perfect, so there'll always be some flaw to gripe about, to make you wonder if they're  The One or if you're just settling, so you will want to leave, because if you leave, you're safe from picking the wrong person. I sense a good bit of that from your post and some responses.

There's also having a good emotional intelligence and realising what's truly important for you in a relationship. Do you want a kind partner, an outgoing partner, a careful partner, a carefree partner? Not just the contradictory stuff like introvert vs. Extrovert, or spontaneous vs. Planner, but what order of priority do things have? Do you say you want a caring, kind SO who is also smart and funny, with little importance on his looks, but in practice you pick guys to date who are outgoing party fun guys with a slightly dickish sense of humour, for example? I used to think I wanted a Super Badass Cool Guy who was also kind and sweet, but as I grew up I realised someone committed to being a Good Person was more important in a partner to me than the Cool Guy thing, as another example. Knowing your priorities will help you decide if the person you're doubting is someone you doubt because of issues you're willing to compromise on, or if it's true dealbreakers that make it hard or impossible for you to love them fully.

Lastly, are you friends with these people? To me, my friends were the dating pool. People I know, have a sense of community with, feel I belong with. People I know have my back and care about me, that I have an emotional connection with. I always knew I'd marry my best friend. And I did. It's not about having all the same hobbies or having everything in common, but you have to be able to talk to them about anything. Communication is the single most important part in a relationship, and communicating with someone is easier when they're a friend. Being best friends and lovers is the best thing to me, but even if I had a different best friend, I think I couldn't be with someone who was, at least, a good friend to me.

I hope this helps you reflect and you find what you're looking for, OP. Good luck.

Lo de que haya más de dos sexos depende por completo en tu definición de sexo.

Nobody is ""meant"" to be with anybody else. We choose a person for the rest of our lives. Love is a feeling, yes, but also a commitment, and even if two people have the world in common it doesn't mean they would be good together. Maybe they're too alike, and he finds your differences refreshing, maybe you complement one another's perspectives and improve each other in a way you wouldn't if you were too similar. I do think it'd be good for you to get therapy for your trust issues, and try to keep in mind that being very similar and meshing well as friends doesn't have to mean anything. Also there's no such thing as ""meant to be"", really. Relationships are what you make of them, no fate involved. 

Second is the fact that your boyfriend isn't being trustworthy, and this is separate from your jealousy issues. He's hiding their conversations, and password-protecting them. While you shouldn't really violate his privacy and that's really bad to do, he shouldn't be hiding this from you. Relationships are built on trust, and if you have trust issues the correct response to clear your doubts would be to show you their messages and be 110% transparent about his interactions with her. This is not what he is doing. He's responded to your slight doubt with hiding things, which of course seems to justify your doubts and escalates things. If he really was being 100% appropriate with this girl, he shouldn't have an issue showing you their messages together. The fact that he hid his messages is a bit of a red flag. You don't say what the content of these messages were. I think that's what makes or breaks this point of mine. Were the messages inappropriate in any way? If so, that's a HUGE red flag. If they were strictly platonic, your boyfriend values his privacy more than his wish to clear your concerns, and you have to decide how much of a problem \*that\* is.

Shaking your head no is a ""no"", as clear as day, and just as valid as if you'd spoken the word ""no"". In sex, overall if these are your first experiences, it's paramount to verify consent at Every Step of the way. He not only isn't verifying consent, he's actively forcing you into sexual acts after you've revoked consent by shaking your head ""no"".

In sex, anything other than an enthusiastic ""YES"" is a hard no. You didn't give an enthusiastic ""YES"" to anything. And going to see you for your birthday is a ""bare minimum"" thing, it's nothing that deserves you blowing him when you don't want to. Also loving you for being you isn't a horribly  monumental task. You shouldn't accept the idea that people with scars and a disability are inherently less lovable, you deserve someone who listens when you shake your head no, someone who says ""You don't seem into it, let's cuddle instead"", someone who says, ""I see you shook your head, that means no, so let's do something else"", someone who says, ""You don't want birthday head? Ok! I'll just skip that part and give you my other present :) "" 

I recommend therapy to address your inability to put up healthy boundaries, regardless of whether you agree that this is a violation of your consent or not. You understand you should be more assertive, and therapy should be able to help a ton with that, and perhaps help you unpack negative feelings toward sex. I don't say any of this is your fault, because he is the one who chose to ignore what you were saying, but you do need to learn to say ""no"" more assertively, so this would be good for you."
relationship_advice,fb3rkxy,t3_ebbbqy,1576485310.0,"Firstly, I'm so sorry you met such a heinous individual and have the misfortune to have him be your loved one's father. Second, I agree with most people that your girlfriend will need space. I would like to give the perspective of the ""don't rock the boat"" metaphor. In this metaphor, there is a boat that represents the family of a toxic person. This person will have learned that if they rock the boat, everyone rushes to stabilize it so that it doesn't sink. They train their children in doing this, as well, and once the children go make their own families and bring their future spouses into the family boat, the family resents the newcomers for not helping steady the boat; they blame people who don't act as ballast instead of realizing the toxic person in their midst is at fault. This is how toxic people get others to do their bidding, and in this metaphor, they would say, ""If you are good and do as I say, I won't rock the boat"", so people scramble to please them and ""earn"" the luxury of a steady boat, something that should be norm. (Kind of like abusers hold their love hostage! ""I'll love you if you take my abuse"" is a common message they try to give.)

Your girlfriend probably has her normal-sensor broken from his abuse, and this means she has probably two reactions to this: One, you hurt her father for something her broken sense of normalcy won't let her realize fully is something horrid, heinous, and frankly unforgivable. Two, you are capable of hurting people, like her father is. So she's probably feeling you're too similar to her father, while the conditioning he gave her makes her feel bad for him and  upset that he's hurt.

Don't apologize to him. I understand respect of your elders, but he is undeserving of respect, by his own actions. They show he has no wisdom through his years, and has only accumulated ignorance, hatred and disrespect. If you wish to, though, you can apologize to your GF's family and say you are sorry they witnessed that, and you are sorry you lost control of your actions. Best of luck to you, and take care.

Being incredibly anxious is normal in this situation. The nerves and anxiety are absolutely par for the course. But it's important to keep in mind that you \*do\* know each other. You know, you've been friends for years. You likely know a lot about each others' likes and dislikes, interests, good things, bad things. There are likely no really nasty surprises here. This is scary, and it's new waters, but it's not completely uncharted territory; you have a map of sorts, from knowing her for so long.

That said, you may want to do things together that you both enjoy. Keep some time open to watch a movie you both like, go to a museum, paintball, or whatever you both enjoy, in order to break the ice at the beginning. You'll want to talk a LOT, I bet, but it's important to also do things that you'd enjoy with no pressure to talk about heavy topics. That's why watching a movie or show together, or doing something active, can be really important. You don't want to pressure each other into too much emotional intimacy when you're still jittery from having each other's physical presence. I think it's pretty important as well not to treat every day as a Super Incredible Special Occasion. It's ok and good to just have normal quiet days with each other without doing anything in particular. Do your hobbies separately but together, don't depend on each other constantly for entertainment. That kind of pressure isn't great in budding relationships.

It's also important to not have too heavy expectations. Nobody's perfect and there is no such thing as a ""soulmate"" in the sense that no one will be perfect to you all the time with no effort required to keep the relationship (platonic or otherwise) going. Whether you stay friends or want to explore romance, you have to keep in mind that whatever expectations you have are yours alone, and you won't be perfect to her all the time, just as she won't be perfect all the time to you. It's ok to want different things, and it's ok to be disappointed if your expectations don't pan out, but it's not ok to blame the other person for it. Compromise is the key to any human relationship, and it's important to keep in mind you both might want different things out of this. I also recommend against going too fast in whatever relationship you end up in. You have time in life! If you rush things too much, you might end up in too difficult a position. So like, don't get married within the week if all goes well :P

It's ok if you both don't feel that spark at first, if you don't super click that well in person. You may find that each other's tone is different than how you read it online, and you may have misunderstood one another because of this at different points. With time and talking though, any awkwardness will likely go away. This is a risk, a huge risk, that you're both taking, and it's ok to be worried and even defensive; trust one another, and trust your 22 year long friendship and feelings. Let yourselves be vulnerable, so that whether things pan out or not, you can feel the closure that you did your best to connect.

If any of this seems contradictory, it's because as most things, you have to find a ""middle"" ground. Not too fast, not too slow. Be vulnerable, but don't pressure or push each other to connect if you're not ready. Do special things, but not all the time. Talk, but also be quiet together. Life is like this, and so are relationships.

Best of luck to you both, and may you find what you are looking for in one another. Take care!"

relationship_advice,f9ceuul,t3_e4j9zn,1575222871.0,"I have had anxiety and depression for a long time, and in my worse moments I could've related to this. This is the thought process I see here, the one I would've had all those years ago:

When you're mentally unwell, the depth of humiliation and self-loathing that you feel when someone is even marginally better than you at something is hard to describe to other people. No rationale can make it better. One feels like a disgusting piece of human refuse undeserving of anything even remotely good when someone is better at something. If she picked this as an activity for you to both be first-timers, she might've wanted to validate the thought that her inability to ice-skate didn't make her a waste of space, and you being better at this than her inherently means that she was wrong, she's worthless and useless. This is neither rational not necessarily conscious, but it's a heavily depressed person's thought process. It's how it goes.

Irrational though self-loathing is, one knows in some way that it's wrong to feel unworthy of existing because one can't do something as well as someone else. So one, subconsciously of course, finds a way to blame someone else. In this case, you MUST have done this to humiliate her. She hates herself and would in fact do that to herself, so why wouldn't you? She wants herself to fail so she can justify her self-loathing, one would do anything to rationalize the feelings that are so strong in one's mind; why wouldn't you want her to fail?

And of course she's angry you remember this and aren't over it. It means she's reminded she's a disgusting failure. It means she's reminded of aaaaaaaaaall the things she messed up. She's probably embarrassed over blowing up, but feels the need to justify it as ""not being that bad"", because otherwise, she IS disgusting and horrible and a waste of existence. She wants to forget, so she doesn't have to hate herself quite so much.

Because really, heavy depression is an exhausting cycle of hating oneself so much one wants to justify it, but also knowing self-loathing to that level is wrong and wanting to validate oneself as worthy of existence. This is how I read the situation- and honestly, when I was her age in the deepest throes of depression, nothing made me have suicidal thoughts quite as much as having someone be marginally better than me at something. It was horrible, and stupid, and irrational, and toxic; it was the fault of an unbalanced brain with heavy depression, but it doesn't justify the toxic habits I tried to use to deal with it. This may be what she's dealing with, or at the least it's what it makes me think of from my own experience. If this is the case, she NEEDS THERAPY ASAP. It's the only thing that really, really helped, along with antidepressants. 

And if you decide this isn't something you can deal with, that's valid. Do what's best for you, overall if she won't do what's best for her. Best of luck to both of you."

relationships,f835rxt,t1_f820imc,1574204944.0,"Look dude, I'm adding myself to the list of Bi women in a monogamous relationship with an opposite sex partner who figured their sexuality out withOUT cheating. I didn't need to kiss a girl and cheat on my wonderful husband to figure out I was into girls. Your girlfriend didn't either.

She kissed the other girl because she wanted to. She kissed the other girl because she's attracted to girls. Yes, I understand many people feel they NEED this to validate themselves, but that's a self-deluding thought born out of internalized biphobia/homophobia and stuff. You don't check out girls and think about their lips because you're comparing yourself to them. That thought that you're overthinking it and you're not \*really\* attracted to girls, because ""haha I'm not gay, right??? << >>"" is bullcrap one feeds oneself because of fear of one's own sexuality. But it's possible to get over it without cheating on your SO, and many of us do. Yeah, sexuality is scary, and confusing, and it's hard to stop denying who you are to yourself. But that's not. an excuse. to cheat.

And to lie about it for several months? That's even worse.

EatingDisorders,f76x4j8,t3_dukp0a,1573438100.0,"I have the story of my mother, diagnosed with early-onset osteopenia at age 35, which was disconcertingly early for her doctors - you're 14 years younger. I will share it because hey, it may help some people be aware of what bone density issues can do to you. She lives with it and takes calcium pills, took good care of herself for the most part, and was careful with her body. She is 66 now and has a heavily deformed back; it didn't become deformed in her old age though. By when she was 40, she had a deep groove going along her back due to lordosis, the deformation of the spine where it bends inward. It looks mildly horrifying. This was just around 6 years after her diagnosis, keep in mind. She's also tilted to one side due to scoliosis, the deformation of the spine where it tilts to one side, off-center. As she's aged, she's also developed spondylosis, caused by wear to her spine. 

All of these conditions are made easier to get when your bones are soft, as with osteopenia. The bones become easy to deform, and even slight bad postures can and will cause deformities more severe than in a healthy person. All of these conditions come with pain and decreased mobility, as well as aesthetic downsides. If you're concerned about your body looking thin and good, well, lordosis can give your back a groove so deep you can fit a glass in it, that doesn't look good. Scoliosis makes you look like you have a huge fat roll on one side, because the spine tilting to one side makes that side compress. No matter how thin you are, that fake fat roll will be there. You can also get kyphosis, or a back hump, much more easily.

Keep in mind any back postures you've carried these 20 years will affect this. Do you hunch over on the computer or chairs? You're a likely candidate for early forms of lordosis and kyphosis. You're so young, you might develop a hump within the next 10-15 years with how bad your bones are!

My mother's spinal conditions meant she fractured a spinal disc- easy to happen with cases of early onset osteopenia and osteoporosis, combined with all the spinal deformities. The pain was indescribable. My mother's the kindest, warmest, sweetest person I knew, and for the first 10 years after her spinal disc fracture and hernia, she became an angry mess, with constant mood-swings, unable to do half the things she did throughout her youth, unable to take full care of herself, unable to cook, to work, to do her hobbies. The pain never went away, but she's learned to manage it better.

Her neck is also causing her great and constant back pain, as the spondylosis causes her spine to painfully compress. She is NOT alright. And this is JUST the things her osteopenia has influenced, she's taken such good care not to fall into osteoporosis. If you don't take care of yourself, this is a possible future.

**HOWEVER**, I don't think scaring you with stories about osteopenia is the way to go about your ED. Have you had therapy? You need to treat, I'm sure you know, the underlying reasons for your ED, not try to scare yourself with possible conditions. If you have depression, this isn't going to help. If you have anxiety, it probably won't help either. If it's body image issues, the idea of being thin will probably trump other kinds of body issues because of its place in society. I've had issues with my mental health and disordered eating, and taking care of the underlying reasons for this is the best way to move forward. I think if you aren't already, you should go to a therapist that specializes in EDs. If you are, maybe you and your therapist aren't compatible and you need to find a new one to make progress. Whatever it is, I hope dearly that you're able to move past it, and that you can have a healthy relationship with food and your weight. Take care of yourself, please."
relationship_advice,f756jut,t3_du8cg5,1573412282.0,"I have been in the position he is. I am sterile and was diagnosed at 18 years old, and it was unbelievably painful to me. He needs time to grieve the loss of his blood-children, and he's probably a bit heartbroken that you needed time to think whether you'd stay with him as well, even though that's a natural reaction to life-changing news like this. For now, I recommend you give him space, but remind him every so often that you want to stay with him. Ask him to not make any decisions until he's processed this loss better, to stop telling you to leave. Ask him to focus on himself and his pain, for now, and when he's healed some you can both focus on your relationship and what this means for it.

It took me and my now-spouse *many months* to be okay enough to start talking about other options, which we have now done. It took at least half a year for us to talk about this without me crying. We've been together for 7 years after my diagnosis, and it was *so* hard the first year or two. I was so scared he'd regret staying with me, or that he'd decide to leave me. I told him the same thing your boyfriend has told you, that he should leave me so he could find a woman to be the mother of his children. He, like you, refused. It was hard to accept at first, because I love him so much that I want his happiness over his being by my side, and this is how your boyfriend seems to feel. Remember he's doing this out of love, misguided though it might be. There's also an element of control to it; I thought it'd be less painful if I broke it off than if he decided to leave me for it ten years down the line. But this doesn't mean you guys are incompatible and can't be happy together. My fertility doctor said I won't be a progenitor, but I can still be a mother; the same goes for your boyfriend. I also went to therapy at college to help deal with it, and even with all the support, it was very painful for many years after the diagnosis; this'll always be a sore spot. But I promise the pain will fade. 

If your boyfriend wants to talk about it to someone who's been there, feel free to shoot me a DM."

I really recommend a good therapist, like, someone with an actual psychology degree, and who is compatible with you after a few sessions. I know it's hard, but it could help you out so much.

As for your main question - your rapist has no rights, it's frankly magnanimous of you to not let him rot in jail, let alone still let him see his child, so screw him and his hissy fits. I don't think your child deserves such a toxic, disgusting human in his life either.

I don't have any experience with this sort of thing so I won't comment much on the boyfriend other than to say, definitely keep his relationship with your son as friend-like as possible. He should be more of ""Mum and I's new nice friend"" than ""Mum's new boyfriend/my new dad"", probably for a few years.

relationship_advice,f4x5ucv,t3_dlzwg8,1571862689.0,"I don't like or understand children most of the time. I can't understand their speech, nor their logic, nor relate to them in a meaningful level 99% of the time. However I'm really good with kids, and I really want to be a mother some day. I'll address my thoughts point by point with regards to your list and you can read them and see if any of it helps you decide how you feel!

* My culture also puts a LOT of emphasis on having children. I've wondered, too, if I want them just because my beloved mum wants to be a grandma. I've thought about it, and I think it doesn't matter to me if part of it is societal. As long as it's something I am happy with, I don't terribly mind what influenced it.   
You might want to think of a radical no-children scenario and see what that does to you, emotionally; like, you're told you're sterile and can't adopt ever for some reason. That worked for me; the first time I knew I wanted kids for real, I was 15 and had a huge mess with my hormones. I spent a whole night crying quiet tears because I thought ""I think I'm sterile"" and it broke my heart; I realized I very dearly wanted children. I \*am\* sterile actually, found out at 18, but my husband and I plan on adopting an embryo or child.
* I also don't understand children (literally, I don't understand their speech, it's like they speak another language), and I don't generally like kids very much. But I have a tenderness about them, I love to make kids happy and laugh; I have a huge maternal instinct where if there's a kid around me, my needs don't matter as much, I need to make this kid happy. It makes me happy to make a child laugh, even though I really don't like them much from a rational viewpoint. My feelings go all ""mush"" and it's exciting. Besides, when you have a child of your own, you're so involved with their life that you can see how their thought patterns form, how they think, what logic they have, and so on. It's easier to relate to the little human you've had a hand in forming and nurturing, if only because you share their environment so much of the time.
* My grandparents and mother were/are all teachers!  They still all wanted children of their own. You might want to keep a journal of your feelings about teaching and parenthood, it might help you draw a conclusion. Also take note that by my family's words, having children of your own is profoundly different, as you're much more involved. The good and the bad are both intensified.
* I'm sorry you suffered parental abuse. That doesn't have to have a deep bearing on how you parent. Keep a journal about what happens, how you act when frustrated, sad, sleep-deprived, and tired; also, of course, try to deal with your mental health issues as much as possible before having children. A journal will help you take note of what negative behaviours you have and it helps keep you aware of them so you don't repeat the same toxic patterns your parents had. If you read something in your journal that reminds you uncomfortable of your mother, you can be aware of it and stop it. It will also help you if you write guidelines beforehand of ""How I want to deal with a tantrum"", ""How I want to deal with entitlement issues"", ""How I want to deal with their being needy when I'm too tired"" and such; it helps you give a structure to things. Even if the kids don't react quite how you expect, it'll help you assert boundaries and keep yourself in check. I have social anxiety so I do this for social situations (i.e. :""How to do Small Talk"", ""How to speak to service people"", ""How to deal with salespeople"", ""How to behave at work"", ""How to behave with the in-laws"", and so on and so forth), and it helps me navigate things a lot! Parent therapy will also be a valuable resource if you decide to parent: someone unbiased to tell you what behaviors and things are normal from a parent, and what are red flags to look our for.

Another note is that if you think of future children as being more of a loss of freedom than a gain as a family member, that's probably an indicator to err on the side of not having kids. If kids feel like a huge sacrifice with little gain to you, that's not a good signal. I'm nowhere NEAR ready to have kids either, but I don't see it as a loss of freedom. Yeah, I won't be able to do some things I'd like, but I can still do most, and I can do them with my baby/babies! (This is probably influenced by my own upbringing, my family took me to all sorts of places and events they liked, I was very privileged.)

Best of luck with sorting out your thoughts, and with your teaching."

From an acquaintances' experience, she'll likely forget she used to be Sara by her teens, so she probably won't be too deeply traumatized by what was done to her in her prior life."

Life is short. A cosmic nothingness. And yet it's so beautiful. Too short and too long, wild, crazy ride; a billion moments stitched together unto a single consciousness. I like to believe it's worthwhile, through all the pain and loss that never truly leaves. I hope you find something in your lives, everyone but especially people in pain, like you, OP, that makes it feel worthwhile and fulfilling and gives your spirit peace, puts those ghosts to rest. Best of luck and my vest wishes."

No one has a right to tell you what to do and no grown ass person will rebuke you for wanting your first time to mean something. If the person you're with goes ""eww virgin, icky!"", or ""ewww, virgin, clingy!"", rest assured in the knowledge that he's a 13 year old maturity-wise and give them the bird."

relationships,f35ngs1,t3_dfnshq,1570682982.0,"As a Latin American woman I would be PISSED. It's not just about the annoying racial stereotyping you might not be a part of, it's a matter of trust. Some of my close friends make jokes about me being a hothead latina and I make jokes about them being, well white, all the time. This is ok because we're friends and have trust in each other, we know we don't mean it in any negative way nor do we believe the stereotypes. One of them made these jokes before I knew him well, and I told  him I wasn't comfortable with that kind of joke in the context of being only vague acquaintances, and he stopped until I let him know I felt enough confidence in him to laugh at this sort of joke.

It's kind of like sex jokes or fart jokes or such to me, in that respect. If a stranger makes a sex joke to me, EWWWWW, gross. If it's my husband, funny. I trust my husband and I know he'd never violate my boundaries, so it's ok if he makes an off color joke, he's a person I'm safe with; same with my friends. If people you don't know make off-color or racist jokes, it tells you they may not be safe people to be around, so it feels upsetting and sometimes like a violation of boundaries; at least, this is what I think."
