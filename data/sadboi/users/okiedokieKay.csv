Turning the bed will create a conflicting point of interest against the blue wall though.. your eye will be drawn to 2 different focal points, in a bad way.... that blue wall just sucks because of the offcenter window, otherwise it would be fine. ): I was also initially thinking I’d like to see the tv mounted over the brown dresser, but since your other items on it have a tall height I don’t think there’s space for it. If you don’t add an actual cushion for the window seat, you could put throw pillows instead. Your bedding is also very lifeless and deflated, I think getting a new bed set would make the biggest difference.

Ok, now to the one and only definitive advice I have for you! Please replace those blinds with a bamboo blind that is same/similar shade of light brown as the dresser and windowseat. imo that would pull the room together in a big way."

The contractor had a supplier catalogue I had to choose from so the base-price of parts was already slightly higher than home depot’s bare minimum. For example, the motor was around $200-300 as opposed to $150 from HD. It’s also a higher quality option though as the price reflects that. Similarly, every upgrade would have had a significantly larger upcharge. For example, adding windows to my door added $200 to the price. If i had upgraded to a fancier window design, that would have added another $200. If you start getting into fancy door designs that alone doubles the materials price, etcetc... I just wanted something functional, because my door was not level and would jam so It was literally unusable. Even before it started jamming I wouldn’t use it because it wasn’t worth the extra time and effort of physically moving it myself instead of just going straight into the house, since it’s a detached garage.

AskHR,fpo825n,t3_ge20h7,1588779991.0,"Not in HR but I came here to state they have implemented this policy at my work place as well, and it seems to be fairly common/growing practice. At my workplace all managers are required to watch the employee take their temperature upon arrival. Anyone working remote is required to zoom and show proof of a safe temperature before traveling to the premises, for the safety of the on-site employees. 

This is a safety protocol and you are not there to substitute a nurse, you are there to verify the data being presented. Social distancing is suggested but not required or enforced by law, so I don’t believe this would be considered an unlawful expectation. It is also not a “data breach”, owners and managers by extension are responsible for providing a safe work environment for their employees. Verifying safe temperature now falls under that umbrella. It would only become a privacy breach if that manager were to then disclose that person’s health to other non-involved staff. For example, if an employee tests positive for covid the employer is legally required to disclose exposure to infection to the other employees - however they CANNOT specify who the source is. For example it would be illegal for the employer to say “John Kennedy has covid” as he would be revealing personal information about an individual. HR would have a legal right to this information for processing purposes (they would have to file the FMLA claims afterall) but to discuss it outside of a formal work requirement would be a privacy violation."

AmItheAsshole,fpcxuxu,t1_fpc2475,1588515454.0,"NTA but I disagree. I would say take him to a couples therapy session so a professional can educate him. His statement was obviously founded in a lot of ignorance. If he has an open mind after the session it’s worth continuing to explore the relationship, but if he doubles down on the statement then you know it will never work and you gave it a fair chance."
charmed,fpcx30y,t3_gccma3,1588514916.0,"Nah they still kept a major threat each season. I think what you’re actually picking up on is the drift away from the original intent of the show. Seasons 1-4 were focused on their journey of discovering themselves and their witch hood. It was based around a very traditional version of what it meant to be a witch. But after they defeated the source they started bringing in other lore (mermaids, leprechauns, magic school) and the show got really ridiculous. In a sense bringing Paige into the group probably singlehandedly kept the show going in the sense of it relying on the plot device of “discovering and advancing our powers” but after they introduced all these other mythical creatures and added a harry potter type world the sisters didn’t feel special anymore from a viewer perspective. And the threats didn’t seem as significant even though they were certainly there, because they were a lot less personal. And instead of saving the world, they shifted to saving the MAGIC world which really made their accomplishments feel less meaningful."

His apology doesn’t really make me feel any better either, it has all the benchmarks of the swoon phase of an abusive relationship. He is overcompensating as a form of controlling you."

DesignMyRoom,fp4kdio,t3_gay0st,1588300965.0,"Ok. I would set it up like they have the picture. Except instead of a fullsize table, I would get a 2 seater bar table and keep it against the wall. Something like this: 

https://www.ashleyfurniture.com/p/rokane-counter-height-dining-room-table-and-bar-stools-set-of-4/D397-223.html

Then directly across from it I would have a murphy bed so that you can put it out of the way when people are around. 

Or you could flip walls and have the murphy bed where the table is, and the flush table between the door and couch. But if you put your bed on the door wall, you’d be able to see the tv while in bed and that was my goal. 

Alternatively you could just get a sofa bed."

Hell I’ve caught myself doing the same thing even, though not in the same mean spirit. Jokes are a type of coping mechanism and it’s how we air feelings that we are trying to push down and ignore. 

I am glad you were already planning to breakup with him. This guy has issues he can’t even be honest about."

isitnormal,foziw8g,t3_ga4x9y,1588191415.0,"This is normal behavior for cheaters. She is getting away with as much as she can and relies on validation from other men. She is likely hiding her relationship from these guys and when they find out she’s taken THEY bounce, because she had been leading them on.
There’s a good chance she has been sexting and will eventually physically cheat on you if given the opportunity.

This is not even remotely normal behavior for a HEALTHY relationship, nor for healthy friendships."

relationship_advice,fovvkfi,t3_g9j503,1588108275.0,People like your sister will never learn their lesson so long as other people like you and your parents keep enabling her. Put your foot down and kick her out. Stop ignoring her comes on to your boyfriend and call her out any and every time. This is not ok and you need to keep reminding her of that.
charmed,foupt4k,t1_fou98oa,1588088386.0,"I don’t think the power of 4 works because they specifically have 3 powers - page wasn’t able to use her telekenesis abilities until prue died. BUT in other episodes where witchcraft didn’t work, she still had her white lighter power. I think if prue came back it would revert paige to only her white-lighter powers which would be detrimental to paige’s personality since she constantly chases independence and would be forced into a support role if only white-lighter. Prue’s return fits better as a spirit or exclusive alternate time-line, but not in any overlap unfortunately..."
relationship_advice,founn0g,t3_g9fx4j,1588087316.0,"If YOU want to have anal sex, YOU need to practice by yourself and prepare by yourself before he comes anywhere near you. I had the exact same experience as you - I enjoyed small stuff and wanted to try it but then it HURT. I did my research - you need to gradually stretch the size up. No matter how many times I have anal, this preparation is necessary EVERY SINGLE TIME or else it will be painful. 

I recommend buying an anal plug. Don’t shove it in all at once, only push the tip in as far as you feel comfortable. Gradually push it further as it feels good. Don’t force it at any point. It will take time to work up to your partner’s size, but any partner worth having will RESPECT YOUR BOUNDARIES AND PACE.

If I was in your shoes I would dump him because he’s basically stated he plans to RAPE you and does not respect you or care about your wellbeing."

If they’ve been taking care of her all these years insurance could have been paying them as the live-in aid. It is time to start shifting that coverage to a more practical solution if they are not physically able to care for her anymore. All of your concerns are valid.
