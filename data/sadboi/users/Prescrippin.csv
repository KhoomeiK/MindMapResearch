A quick read that might be worth your time. I'm honestly a bit confused by your questions, but it is late here and im probably just sleepy.

In my opinion, your best bet would be the simplest one. To me it seems like you need a simple relational database with the tables ""surveys"", ""users"", & ""options"". 

You can then display a ""survey"", to a certain ""user"", with the following ""options"".

You would then have a ""response"" table (preferably anonymous) that would receive the submitted surveys.

For the backpack:

1) use your nicest casual looking (not a “bummy” or military etc.) backpack to not raise too much suspicion. More low key the better.

2) pack one or two battery banks with cords for anything you’ll need. A handheld GPS could also prove very useful, or a map and compass. Destroy and ditch your cell phone in some sort of dump truck or water source.

3) ask some random person outside a gas station to go buy you a cellphone with minutes, that you will only be using for emergencies and preferably no GPS. Keep it turned off until needed.

4) pack a small utility knife or pocket tool, and multiple fire starters. Depending on the terrain and distance, a machete or tomahawk could also prove useful and will easily fit in most bags.

5) pack a focused but powerful flashlight for walking though the bush to stay off the roads that will catch unwanted attention

6) trail mix, multiple power bars and water bottles. Plan for like a day or 2? You need to move quick and food will help you keep going.

7) $100 at least in cash to pay for things if it’s absolutely necessary.

8) socks and underwear and a change of clothes/another disguise

Also I think I have heard of python web libraries, excuse my ignorance but I think it’s called Django? This might be an easier way to implement your code into a web app than trying to find some kind of converter/transpiler/wrapper to embed your python code into php or JavaScript. (I’m just guessing)

I’m also going to lay out my opinion of what this stack possibly look like:

- A cloud based instance such as AWS, Heroku, etc. that you are able to install and run python on. Lots of guides and options on this. Be careful with billing!

- A foundation built with the Django web framework (should be easy to learn if you read the docs and are already learning python)

- Copies or references to your ML python library and other necessary code etc.

- Manipulating/fetching/processing your ML data in the back end and using Django to show the chosen info to the end user (this is the “view” in [model-view-controller](https://g.co/kgs/CSav7s)  systems)

As I’m unsure about the level of your knowledge of this stuff I wanted to lay it out simply, so please don’t take offence if I’m telling you things you already know.

I personally trust my GP with my mental health more than any nurse that has helped me, with no offence to them either.

As for “you not doing the work”, this can be the exact reason people fail to fix their mental health, and I’m speaking from experience.

Also, a nurse can make a mistake and know that they caused it. With mental health, like you said, it’s not black and white. You could be the definition of a perfect mental health worker and your patient could still succumb to their inner demons. Or like you said, be incompetent, but their client survives. They are different battles and should not be compared IMO.

&#x200B;

>Q: ""*How are people moving away from flash?*""

A: It's quite simple. The features included in **CSS** (keyframe animations) and **JavaScript**(scripting) far surpass what Flash could offer, albeit with maybe some more work. Modern web design has changed alot since [homestarrunner.com](https://homestarrunner.com/) could have been considered a valid web application/game/whatever it is. No offense, it's just that things change and tools change and die. **TL;DR: There are newer, faster, & better options**

&#x200B;

>Q: ""*How do people accomplish the things Flash did? / Why not Flash?*""

A: There are many [tools](https://animista.net/) and [libraries](https://threejs.org/) dedicated to what's (I believe unofficially) called **Web 3.0**. A quick read of [**this article**](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/web-3-0/) can shed some light into the recent change in paradigm. You may have noticed that there has been a large shift towards 3D graphics in websites in recent years, and people expect extremely well polished websites when it comes to web applications and digital multimedia. Here are some examples: [\#1](https://sagmeisterwalsh.com/), [\#2](https://garden-eight.com/), [\#3](http://www.playmapscube.com/). These beautiful sites just couldn't be made with Flash. **TL;DR: 3rd party tools & coding / Because Flash is simply obsolete**

&#x200B;

>Q: ""*How do people do animations, artwork, keyframes, scenes without tools?*""

A: They develop a deeper understanding of the tools they are given, and use other people's tools ([libraries](https://threejs.org/) etc.) for things they don't need to (necessarily) understand. They don't need to accomplish this without tools(Flash), it's just that there are new tools at hand, and they have evolved from the necessities of [Web 3.0](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/web-3-0/). I don't do much web animation so i can't really provide further insight on the issue. **TL;DR: Education, passion, and creativity**

&#x200B;

I hope this clarifies some things.

You're reinventing the wheel. I really suggest you find a third party solution to this instead of creating your own. Also, if youre going to be hosting files, your users are going to expect fast and reliable downloads, so you're looking at having a high-bandwith, high storage system. 

If yure serious about doing this i suggest looking into AWS and virtual instances. With these tools you only pay for what you use as opposed to a monthly fee. If your host sees tons of bandwith its usually within their right to terminate the server, resulting in a down website. This works the other way too though, because if you pay as you go but somebody spam uploads hundreds of files, it could easily cost you upwards of thousands of dollars in a day.

In my opinion, your best bet it exporting it at the proper size with maximum quality, then worry about optimizing it after.

Best of luck friend!"
