It was Math and my class had to do course work which was 20% towards our final grade.

I did the coursework and handed it in feeling some what proud of myself for having done it. 

Math was not my strongest subject and 16 years on, any mathematical nonsense thrown my way and I'm like 
'I will not fathon that utter butchery of my brain cells.' 

Sorry math lovers, if it isn't already obvious, English was my fortÃ©

A few weeks on and my Math teacher 'lost' my coursework as well as a few other of my classmates and requested that we do it again. I refused. Why should I take responsibility for something that was clearly his fault. He did not apologise for losing our work, it was purely logical for us to redo it for him and I couldn't comprehend this. So I refused.

Afterwards he followed me to my next class which was I.T and decided to confront me about it in front of another teacher, however he changed stories claiming that I had never done the coursework in the first place and I refused to do it.

I was extremely offended and appalled by his behaviour and made a point of this. I wasn't shouting at him or making a commotion, I merely stated that I wasn't redoing coursework that he lost. However he was shouting and becoming hysterical, trying to bring in my I.T teacher into the matter for back up. 

Thankfully he had sense to ignore the issue as quite rightly, it had nothing to do with him. Afterwards I refused to go to any Math lessons and skipped the class all together."

I like to think a dark and foreboding beast is waiting to comfort me and when I give in, I turn to embrace it and it slowly consumes me. 
For a while its beautiful laying in its arms but when I want to leave...the weight of it is almost suffocating, its claws have imbedded themselves into my bones. 

It's like a drug I know I shouldn't take.
It's just sat there waiting in my shadow, waiting for something to make me turn it's way."

They say to cut out the negativity from your life, remove the emotional vampires but for some reason, that excludes any blood relatives ESPECIALLY parents.
What helps me is feeling that the ones who object are lucky they never have to experience having to be in your shoes. It can be annoying but you are a whole different kind of strong because of it, and you are extra special to your sisters, you're much more than a brother...you're their hero."

AskReddit,f3psbyi,t3_dhc7vw,1571064248.0,"It's a common one for me unfortunately as society seems to dictate you as a person based on three common questions:

Are you with anyone?
Do you have a job?
Do you have children?

I am a 30 year old female, married for 3 and together for 6. I have a full time job but because I don't have children I am asked A LOT why I don't have children.
For the sake of them and myself I say that I don't want them which is partly true, but I can't physically have them either...
I don't mind so much the question of if I have any, it is the why and the refusal to accept my answer, the persistence into it.  

Last night it went as far as 'And I assume you're on contraception? Being as you don't want them.' And 'What would you do if you were pregnant?.'"

I feel like I need to elaborate on this; When this subject was being taught at school, I was bedridden with the flu so I missed that and how to read Roman numerals.

It wasn't until I was 17 that I plucked up the courage to admit this to my Dad. And he taught me to the best of his ability, he was very patient with me.

It takes me a moment on a full faced clock, but if someone asks me what time it is, I will panic and my mind won't function with the information."
