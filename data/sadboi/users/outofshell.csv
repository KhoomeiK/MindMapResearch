Beyond noisy kids though, sound levels are a big issue with restaurants. There are a few places with great food where I never see kids, but when it's busy it gets so loud just from everyone's normal conversations that it becomes really unpleasant to be there, to the point that I've stopped going.

Iirc it codes for a lipid transporter; there are three variants of the gene: one is regular, one is less effective at its job, one is super effective. If you have one or two copies of the version that codes for the less effective transporter, eating saturated fat is going to be bad for you.

coolguides,fot3jkr,t1_fors6vt,1588043846.0,"> Canadian governments try and force metric on people as hard as the can, because being anti-American can be quite popular in Canadian government.

There isn't some nefarious government policy of anti-Americanism behind the metric system. 
  
Canada adopted metric because it made sense to adopt it (as you said, it's way better for science and engineering), many of our trading partners were adopting it at the time; even the U.S. was adopting it until they reversed course. Not to mention, we were already confusingly misaligned with our closest neighbour before the conversion happened (British imperial here vs. U.S. imperial)."

Airplanes are too gross not to use some kind of disinfectant wipes (and who can avoid touching their face for several hours?)."
Anticonsumption,fot0orm,t1_foszwr6,1588042057.0,"I've tried those packets with multiple wipes, and unless I'm on a longer trip, I use so few that they all end up drying out before I can make it through the little pack. 
  
Despite feeling bad about the garbage, I bought a bag of those individually-wrapped wipes for shorter travel and as an emergency stash in my bag, and use them only for that. They ended up being useful in that context. But I couldn't imagine using them every day at home."

Talking about antibody tests like it's his bright idea and no one is listening despite people literally working on that. Leave it to the epidemiologists and immunologists, dude. 
  
Same problem in the climate change field. Seems like there's been lot of physicists and geologists among the academic ""climate skeptics"", not realizing that they're not climatologists."

We already HAVE been hearing a lot about it though. He's on there ranting like it's some brilliant idea of his that no one is talking about, but it's been all over the news for weeks. Especially the issues with how unreliable so many of the antibody tests seem to be and the challenges of ensuring we have a good one if we're going to rely on it for determining what's safe to do in terms of easing restrictions. People have been talking about it all over the place for a quite a while now."

childfree,fosoody,t1_forcycd,1588034895.0,"I definitely read that comment as halfway sarcasm (I mean...I hope it is?). But they do make a point that an intelligent adult human is fully capable of learning stuff without a woman to show them how, if they care enough to do so. 
  
If he absolutely needs some hand-holding, make a household Google Doc with some links to cleaning resources like FlyLady, UFYH, any of the cleaning guides you can find online, and a suggestion to google things like ""how to clean inside an oven"" etc.  I mean, women don't come out of the womb knowing how to clean an oven, and I'd be googling it too--an approach that doesn't require ovaries. 
  
The most important thing, imo, is this weird thing where guys ""don't see"" the mess. And they say ""you just need to tell me and I'll do it."" But no, you're not their manager--that's just another job! As adults they need to learn to see what needs to be done and just do it without a woman needing to ask them. 

My spouse and I use Tody to keep track of our cleaning tasks. It reduces the ""not seeing"" problem a bit because we can both look at the app at the ""overdue tasks"" part and just pick one of the most disgustingly overdue tasks and do it. No need to notice it in your environment.
  
What we do both notice is when the other person has done something, and we always make sure to say ""hey I noticed you did xyz, thank you!"" Helps keep morale up :)"
