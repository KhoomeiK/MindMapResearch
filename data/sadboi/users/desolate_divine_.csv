I’ve felt like I’ve given so much to others, and have just been fucked left and right. It’s caused a lot of resentment toward White people and even more to myself. But I’m learning to get past the victim mentality and finding the hero within me.

It’s taken a long time, but I’ve begun to be stronger and listen to my instinct. If someone has done me wrong, I don’t need to keep them in my life. If my gut tells me to move on, then I cut them out. I’ve protected others too long and not myself enough, but that’s over with.

At that point I began to take it more seriously and understand it, but that didn’t stop me from doing drugs and drinking and going into a severe manic episode. At that point about two years ago I really understood the nature of bipolar and how important it is to monitor myself and recognize symptoms, like high energy, rapid thoughts, excessive spending, talking fast, just to name a few. 

I used to hate it, but now I view it as a part of me and while I am careful to make it my identity, it is and is what makes me, and every BP, unique. There is something about being diagnosed that really changes you and the way you look at life, and so I see it as an evolutionary step, not an impediment, which I know sounds shocking.

Good luck, OP."
