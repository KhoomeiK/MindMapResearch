BPD,fhjkrku,t3_f3gzvk,1581648643.0,"It's actually pretty common for people with trauma (not saying you have trauma, but a lot of pwBPD do) to lack details in their speech. Here's a medical journal that can explain it a lot better than I can lol.

>Child development research suggests that regular language development may be disrupted in children who later develop BPD because the primary caregiver‚Äôs verbal communications tend to be inconsistent with nonverbal messages (Judd & McGlashan, 2002). Thus, borderline children experience signiÔ¨Åcant difÔ¨Åculty learning how and when to use language to meet their needs."

BPD,fem0xlb,t3_eps2f8,1579236209.0,I had the Kylena for 3 months and went bananas. It made my symptoms significantly worse. I've got the copper IUD now and feel infinitely better.
BPD,fem0sz8,t3_epuzme,1579236096.0,"Fact checking! It's a DBT skill that I've been practicing recently and it's really been helping. Practice being mindful of your thoughts, and when you notice you start manifesting conflict check the facts. Did you do anything to make them upset? Are they actually upset or are you reading too much into it? Also thinking back on previous exchanges and reinforce the positives of the conversations. It used to take a single thing to start that spiral for me, but with practice it gets much easier! Be patient with yourself though, the fact that you are aware of this shows progress. Congratulations on your new job and good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,f7fd803,t1_f7f9jls,1573676943.0,"Its not like these are people that the OP doesn't know well. These are people who have been in her life for 4 years. And Serina asked Fred for security in the relationship, to which he supposedly obliged to only to immediately go back on his word. Its not like the information about his behavior is being told to everybody and their mother. She's telling Rachel, who the OP has had a friendly relationship w for 4 years, that the person she's currently seeing has had toxic behaviours, not just in the past but literally weeks ago. Honestly this is just consequences for his shitty behavior. It's not like she going out of her way to hurt Fred, but to protect Rachel. NTA"
BPD,f6eik3y,t3_dqvfsb,1572804461.0,"I used to feel that way, but then I learned that it's completely normal. Literally everyone tries to gain others favor and support. The way you treat others determines if you're a good person. Are you manipulating people into giving you support and offering nothing in return? Are you acting out at your friends and calling them fat? You're allowed to have thoughts that aren't ""good people"" thoughts, your actions are what reflect you. And you don't have to be a good person all of the time. At the end of the day we are just people, and as long as you're not doing some seriously fucked up shit, then it's okay."
mentalhealth,f5jsuq4,t3_do3xsr,1572239426.0,"If you have any spare in come, the get a Sun lamp. The kind that creates vitamin D. Seasonal depression is a bitch and a half, so being diligent with self care and self validation is a must. Its okay to feel those feelings, its not like they just go away, but being aware that thought are not truths. Also, maybe during the spooky time of the year avoid social media. As much as it sucks to hear, in the current social climate your triggers aren't anyone else's responsibility. While it would be lovely (and personally speaking stuff w gore and horror should have a trigger warning but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what can you do) you can't expect the world to understand what it's like to have to cope w such anxiety. I used to have panic attacks a lot, and something that helped me was to actually lean into it. Feeling the panic attack, but knowing that it *will* end cut the panic attack shorter. Or, on the other hand, destract yourself during a panic attack. Both worked for me. The only advice anyone can really give you is the same advice everybody gives people with mental health issues; therapy, good nutrition, and self care, etc. But on the rock bottom days, even doing the bare minimum is so so much better than doing nothing at all."

mentalhealth,ewkkfnm,t1_ewkigtw,1565486856.0,"You might not want to, but you still should see a professional. Self diagnosis can be helpful to connect and talk to people who experience similar thing to you, but isn't a reliable way to treat mental illness. If you're wanting to improve your mental health you *need* to talk to a professional. They have gone to school for years and have the experience to help you. It's okay to be afraid, but don't let fear ruin your mental health.

Edit: grammar"
AskReddit,ewkig0x,t3_coq9wy,1565485307.0,"I started by writing down what I wanted/had to do that day. Eventually I'd jot down how I was doing that down in little tid bits. It's been years now and I write about a page or two almost everyday depending on what going on. (Recently there's been a lot lol)

 It's also important to be patient with yourself. It's hard being honest with yourself and writing down stuff you really dont want people to read can be challenging. It's okay to go days, even months without journaling. Use it as a tool to help you and eventually it will become a habit.  

Also get good pens. I like muji pens."
