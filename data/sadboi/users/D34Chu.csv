Menninger talks about how so many societal problems and it's root causes come back to the home. Imagine having a world where parents actually want their kids and are stable enough to have them.

Majority of our parents had kids as a sense of duty and checking it off an itinerary. Now add in cultural perspectives that shouldn't exist in the millennia and you are officially living an abnormal/slave-like existence watching modern life pass you by and defending your choice to off yourself from a life that has never been yours..

I postponed actually killing myself recently only bc I wanna wait until I'm not in their presence. At the very least, the last face I wanna see would not be my family. They came together recently and been nice here and there but it will never subtract from the great efforts they made to silence me and abuse me to the point that I now have multiple physical problems from it with no career, education or social life.

The system is completely setup for them!!! Fostercare then ptsd for starters for the rest of your life and what happens to them? Nothing!!!!! 

It's easier to get justice from an abusive spouse than it is your family ffs



Edit: on top of this, whenever I talk about feeling this way... everyone is immediately quick to shrug it off, encourage me to calm down, let it be and work through it... how in the hell is my response abnormal?! 
They say I have a grudge and revenge issues... I doubt they would say this if it was my bf. 

There's this movie called final cut, and I honestly wish something like that existed and I see now it's happening.. forget ptsd and not having a family but now you're asked to prove your story and even then. That's why it's easy for me to talk about the abuse.. not bc ""I let it go"" or healed from it but bc investigators, social workers, teachers constantly questioned me and I had to repeat all the abusive details over and over and over at a very young age. I never wanna talk about it but it's second nature for me bc of the fucked up system that's also more harmful than helpful. I think there should be more done to prove AND prosecute abuse with consequences that could actually scare parents. Abuse is such a  prevalent, common domestic situation and we have almost zero preventative measures. As if it's such a rarity.

Not only that but abuse is typically proven to be a precursor or direct cause to criminal or harmful behavior later on in life. Karl Menninger talks about how it's a root of our society that's basically neglected. It's all environmental and our system ignores that as well as improvement in education for everyone. This is where our next generation comes from and there seems to be almost no effort to improve it.

Forget about next leaders of America- simply why don't we do enough for the so called kids we care about? All these pro lifers cant seem to understand the real way to care about the young. 

There's no reason for a system to cater to abusive families but in general the system is there to support the elite with its various loopholes than it is for the rest of us. The fact that there's even a term called soft tissue bruising? Which is not considered a serious offense? Smh

We're stranded, confused, jumpy then we're called liars then we spend the rest of our lives struggling to love ourselves, we spend the next few or many years in the system like convicts and what happens again to the family that abused them? They go about their lives filled with happiness that their unwanted is finally gone. 

And that's if the system steps up rather than works together to protect the abuser which happens in the elite lil towns."

Telepathy,fjmfsdu,t1_fje5tih,1583469403.0,"I forgot to mention that some of that isn't telepathy but more street smarts. If you're around people who basically are two faced, you have to learn what sets them off. 

I've unfortunately had way too many people try to get close who had some kindof objective related to gangstalking. It is a real thing and it's more predictive.. they stalk you and figure you out so you just have to practice not feeding into it.

My best tactic is having a routine and it has to be something somewhat satisfactory to them and sad because that's kinda their sick mission. The reason why I like doing this is because I can get things done without sabotage and interference. If I have a routine, they can't predict when I actually have something outside of that routine going on and I can conceal my plans easier without less disruption. Essentially, they think every thurs in the afternoon, I do this but I make plans in advance through a channel they don't have access to so when thurs rolls around.. they don't see it coming, don't have enough time to plot and can't interfere. 

Anytime I talk about plans and really big ones I'm excited for, they are almost always sabotaged but if I use devices that are outside of their range and communicate to those I trust and through channels they don't have access to online then it's easier and idk why this works but it does. There's a sociologist who has a lot of tips and tricks to dealing with it. 

So this is gonna sound funny but most people can read eachother and pick up on your expressions and body language. Once you understand the science behind that and alter your vibes, expressions etc using it then these assholes basically can't get to you. That's the gist what I'm saying.

So I'll use something from my own life as an example. So I've had people think that I had a crush on someone.. this has been pattern with some fake friends. Let's say we're all at a party and they go up to that person, they gossip to him about me and then one of these fake friends dates him and watches for my reaction. I fake being sad whatever lol. (Yeah they actually have a relationship with him for my sake lol so it goes on for a few weeks). So while they are at the party talking to my crush.. what they don't realize is I lied to them. My crush is on the opposite end of the room and not the person I told them. This has been a regular tactic that I use. Yeah it's disturbing and yeah it happened long after high school. 

I've had some who knew I was going to a big event right? So I lied about the date and location to everyone and then last min I corrected it. The change was too last min for them to disrupt. In the past, they would show up and make a scene or create some other disturbance on the day I needed to be there. 

Why do these assholes exist and have such extreme motives? I don't really care.. I just think they view some people as objects like in a  video game and they have stats. They wanna hurt people and brag about it. They brag about how clever their plots are and they just like are more fucked up trolls.. this person is a loser, is fat, is phony, is crazy, is a slut, is a bitch, etc., they believe sometimes that even what they're doing is heroic and like I'm the bad guy. Even if I made mistakes or someone hurt me.. I wouldn't be doin what they do unless it was something really horrible. And even then, this is too twisted and passive aggressive. If I really wanted to.. I wouldn't take them down privately, I would go for the same things they're doing which is their livelihood and thats kindof what gangstalking does sadly. 

In short, with telepathy.. you do have to hide your emotions and thoughts bc some may not be able to read but they have been stalking you long enough to know your tells and behaviors enough to know some of what you think and some will try to send messages. I am a firm believer in the tactic that some therapists use for night terrors and you fight them verbally or physically if they try to send messages using lucid dreaming techniques. It's always worked for me and i laugh at them, I realize that they might hate on me but they are spending an incredible amount of their time and resources on me and it's sad in and of itself. 


TL:DR
This is more to do honestly with social ostracizing and bullying bs. That's what I mean by tricking, they think they have predicted my behavior and are onto me but I have been paying attention and since I know what their desired result is? I just make my own plans to mess up their result. It is very stressful and I've grown up in a small town my whole life with the same hateful people and I hope one day, I can change my environment and leave this behind. Idk if any of this made sense, I'm a lil sleepy but yeah that's the best I got."

astrology,fjcrigc,t3_fbwqur,1583233662.0,"I'm 33, Midwest.

I initially got into it because I love astronomy and not many Libra descriptions ever felt relatable but as I became a bookworm and my Scorpio/Virgo researcher came out, I decided to find out what's the hype with astrology. There is SO much to learn.

I think its become way easier to learn and find information. It's also become mainstream and I don't feel as crappy openly discussing it anymore. 

I think I disagree by and large with many astrologers and how they can become sticklers about certain rules and I just think it's not as straightforward without an in-depth reading. 

What I have come to understand and it keeps me coming back is that of all the philosophies and religion in the world- the one that actually seems accurate and predictive has been astrology. It's not %100 but there is really WAY more accuracy in astrology than any other theology or philosophy I've seen.

It just blows my mind that the Aquarius era and Aquarius traits are about modernism, tech and disconnected emotions but also in touch with humanity, slightly political. Like wow- that's exactly what's happening as we shift from Pisces. 
~ When you read about these eras from the Gemini era to the Aries. You see generation qualities (Leo = boomers). Chinese astrology also is amazing too.

I don't think that astrology should ever be taken way too seriously but if and when it does apply can be super interesting. We are not as predictable as science might have us believe and we are all different.. we could have an in-depth reading but we will still react differently or have different experiences than what our chart might say to an experienced astrologer.

I would never convince anyone and I only talk about it if someone is interested. I barely believe it myself sometimes, always still learning. I would never consider myself that advanced and I always say so and give them resources on how to learn more if interested. I almost stopped reading it 5 years ago until I discovered decans/dwads which is rarely used but suddenly.. my placements made a lil more sense.

The community can be hit or miss, but I often have positive experience than negative. I do notice anybody involved in paganism can have a more subjective and even negative pov, sorry just has been a pattern for me. Astrologers that you click with are always going to be subjective and you may not always agree with them but you can always stand to learn from them. I tend to bond better when I meet someone irl than online about astrology. I think because we can openly observe and get to know eachother than online where it's very easy to misunderstand someone and not really know them as well. 

I do know for a fact tho that if somebody you don't get along with is into astrology? They will always use you as an example but it has to be someone who already hated on you before they even knew your sign. 

So just like any community, it's not all perfect, the information is not always easy to learn and accessible. However if it's something that can give you a bit more direction and understanding then why not? I'm a cancer asc and I didn't think paying attention to lunar cycles would matter for me but it so does. I know that my generation planets matter so much.. I've met people on same Bdays and locations but their years are different and it really changes things. 

I like that astrology makes up for the stereotypes and constantly shows that it's not as straightforward. We're all different, have layers and can grow. 

Most importantly I think that circumstances and environment will always have the biggest effect on you than mbti, astrology or any other label. How you grow up will be your biggest indicator and what shapes you more than anything imo."

Venus scorp 4H ~
Moon Libra 4H ~
Saturn sagg 5H with sag Uranus ~
Pluto scorp 4H ~

https://postimg.cc/gallery/2522x1ife/

Moon and Venus seem like the way Pisces is often described.. soft, fair, feminine and lovely. I couldn't describe my life as that... but when I think of the traits of Saturn and Pluto and their impact on my chart.. it makes sense. 

I think deep down I connect with Sagittarius and Pisces the most and some of my Venus moon traits but outwardly, my life seems to be drowned by Pluto and Saturn energy. I find myself always leaning towards sex as a failsafe and point of observation and also just research or getting to know myself. Although I don't know that I have ever felt the full scorp intensity.

 I'm more reserved and disbelieving to even go as far as some scorps do in relationships. Caps seem to be so obsessed with career, politics and money. I don't feel that way but I do feel earthy obsessive energy with order and I find im always hating myself for screwing up, details details, pushing myself too much, overwhelming myself, constant craving for structure, routine and then getting burnt out ofc. 

Whenever Saturn, Pluto, or Uranus is in retrograde.. life makes more sense. There's a lot of Pluto in my 4H which I think makes for a pretty unstable environment.. since that's my natal, I've always feared that no matter what.. home will never be calm and secure.

I've lived in my car before and he bought it in 2010. This car has a track record of lasting for years and doing well. Even tho it's in his name, to this day I struggle to maintain it while also making sure he'll never turn around and sell it. Everytime I take it in, I find some weird botched mechanic job he did with his cousins that's a lil too convenient. He constantly talks shit about new car tech and the car breaking down when it's all about money and me not having transportation. He says he'll have me lease cars from him but i have zero interest in relying on him. 

I passed my driving tests and it took time cause I failed the initial one. I had no one to practice with except maybe few guyfriends and football coach(ahem tomboy). In about 200h you can get your license at 16+ but my parents didn't want that and so I ended up with a road test at 19. I'm that driver that has very little road experience :)

I had to beg for rides from school bc no one above 16 rode the bus.. and I already dealt with bullies so any guy that hit on me gave me a ride but since we were all sporty together and friends, I was always lucky and they never hit on me. Almost always bought me lunch, let me sleep  and sometimes catch up on hw while they ran errands after school. During summer school tho, I'd had it and was lucky enough to get a copy of the keys to the car and drove myself regularly without a license until I got caught a few times doing 5mph over smh

I have traveled far and wide but I suck at basics and am terrified most of the time. Then I had a phase where I did a lot of racing so yay..

After I finished the 2 school tests at 16, when I was 17.. parents greeted me on a snowy day with a Camry in the driveway then asked me inside the house to basically say I can't drive it and when I asked ""when?"" They said, Idk. They were still trying to convince me and the community that I was too mentally disabled to even drive... yep. 

This is coming from my mom who speeds regularly and uses speed with wine ha and my dad who has cut off so many people on the road last min that I've never seen anyone not grip the sides of the car in passenger with him. 

The mental disability thing is of a larger set of circumstances to discredit me.. I tested really high in elementary and my bro tested for disability but since my mom was vocal about her hatred for me and the whole sons vs daughters thing in our culture.. they spent a lot of time discussing my mental health with the entire community and anybody who would listen. Then I found out I'm from a community that frequently ""rehabs"" their kids via squad cars for the most teenage of teenage behaviors like insubordination can land you with a diagnosis and cuffs on. I know so many that this has happened to sadly and I remember one who was sent to Canada boot camp for 2 years for a lil baggie of mary j. They put him on heavy doses of pills too. He talks about ptsd from it and how he smokes more when he has flashbacks and how he was suicidal being away from his friends. 

So yeah major elements in your life get messed with depending on the circumstance. Driving is no exception. This was frustrating to share but I'm happy to see I'm not alone...

Also I didn't learn to tie my shoes until almost 3rd grade. They literally screamed and hit me while folding the shoelaces if I asked even one question. I begged someone at school who hated me when we passed in a empty hallway if he could please please spend 5m teaching me. Before learning I just tucked my shoelaces in or knotted them and tucked. Or just wore Velcro or buckled shoes."

I've never been the type to advocate it which is why I've been going off the deep end last few couple years. 

I'll never be that individual that looks good on paper and someone actually wants and treats well for starters. When you're young, flaws are more acceptable and as a woman,  they're definitely even less acceptable when you don't fit into even the most low bar societal standards and when you constantly are told you have masculine features. 

Also I prob seem like that friend but it's one sided story bc all those friends I go out of my way to make sure I'm there for them.. I don't want them to just vent..

abuse,fj91n62,t3_fbtlk9,1583128834.0,"*change the locks or get a roomie or both! For starters

When you first said your story, I assume it was bc when you get into certain positions.. glasses could seriously get in the way. I remember I dated someone where we both wore glasses and we both put them away.. or like when we kiss, they naturally get in the way and he or I would remove them carefully. But if there isn't much more positions? After the confrontation, what she did is quite messed up. If your vision is that bad during sex then that's not something she can help. That might be a concern to fix your vision.. I want to simply for the convenience.. idrc what anybody else thinks of me wearing glasses or contacts. 

I assumed it was bc the glasses could break during but how she's handled it really creeps me out and I hope you take steps to be done with this whole situation"
abuse,fj90vg4,t3_fc4mk7,1583128082.0,"Go to the place where it happened or try to find an object or outfit you wore when it happened. If you or someone involved wore a certain scent at the time- find it at the store if you can and try and see if it helps. Clear your mind and just tune into whatever happens.. try talking to someone that was present when it happened or a friend that you knew around that time. 


Nature walks are amazing like a trail you're very familiar with and baths/swimming with mood lighting. Ambient music in general can help.

 Lastly if you want, I wouldn't but sometimes hypnosis can help - just make sure you ask for a copy of the recording and you want to know exactly what happened during. Meditation in general can help.. details are very tricky and also anything with your triggers will set off a flashback naturally imo. I get flashbacks a lot but over the years, the details are very blurry now. 

I realize now that if you keep a journal and openly write about your abuse- this counts as evidence if there was an investigation. I had almost everything I owned regularly tossed and often would come home to a new PC and my old one wiped along with assignments ofc. My mom went through the entire house when I wasn't home even for boredom and constantly rearranged so hidden cams/mic let alone journals were tough. I tried to leave it at school or somewhere outside which was even worse ofc. Never had anybody who could keep it for me either but yeah in general it helps to record. Also putting it online helps but be aware that all your info is accessible by hackers or by the company and if it goes under? So does all your data. I had several online journals and a lot of them got hacked or the website shut down along with my info. I sent emails to myself and others and had all that hacked as well. I suggest making 2 email accs and saving the pw/login info somewhere written and just emailing them to yourself then deleting a copy from your first acc. Then they're all stored there. Gmail is the best for this ofc. Gmail didn't exist when most of my shit happened lol"

SuicideWatch,fj39dvh,t3_fb5nzp,1582974085.0,"This is gonna sound harsh but I said to my ex and few others.. you want him to stay but you only thought of talking to him in death.. 

My ex wanted me to stay but I said to him, ok stay with me? When I'm homeless, can I stay with you? When I'm on my last rope.. would you really be there, would you call me and be there for me? Would you be in my life?? He realized that he couldn't say yes to any of that and he apologized.. he said he missed me and wished he could say something but he knew that I was right.. ofc it's the right thing to tell someone not to do it but when someone is truly struggling.. that's when they really need support. 

So many want me to stay but don't know how to address or actually help.. I've always faced things alone. There is a deep shame so Idk that anybody knew what he was going through and support system doesn't guarantee anything either.

However I've heard of others who had attempts and were surrounded before and after.. I think it can make a difference sometimes but without it is harder. Yes you care for him but you weren't showing it when he was alive..

So that means there's people that do care but aren't reaching out? That's quite painful. Why stay if these people who care aren't even letting me know they do while alive? When I'm at my lowest and worst? They're disgusted.. so nah. I won't stay. 

If you notice signs and you do really care? Then you have to reach out, you have to if you really care. A standby support is not going to be as efficient.. don't feel guilty if you didn't know or know him too well. 

All I'm saying is .. you're asking someone to stick around bc people care but just suck at showing it? Most important my life is mine- I will stay alive for my life but not if that life looks like death already. Life is not for acquaintances and bad family and metaphors. Everyone has their own reasons but I bet the one thing that'll make them stay is what matters to them as Individuals and their life. 

This just my personal opinion and I've known someone who was going to and I begged him not to.. I saw it coming. We were both in a rough place and I couldn't help him. I think about him all the time and spending more time with him when we were younger before it all got worse. I think about finding out and screaming and crying... but I accept his fate, maybe not the pain but it was his decision. I will fault the bs in his life but never him and nor me... I'm quite broken from it. My point is, we don't always know what the right move is but if you do look at survivors- they need active support and it's not something anybody handle. So if you do really care, pay it forward. Reach out more and make sure they know you care. Even then, it may not be enough so it's ok. Everybody has their reasons and a good system always helps but not a guarantee. In general tho, always let someone know you care.. ya never know how it could help. Always keep them in your heart.. their spirit will always be there."
insomnia,fj387o0,t3_fb5ww4,1582972339.0,"Mood lighting or soft lighting or string lighting even has been helpful and I put something in front (like a heater or bag of laundry) so I don't see the glare but just has like soft turquoise/blue shade. I also painted my walls cobalt and if I could I'd buy that machine that makes ocean waves or a galaxy appear.. I have a chill playlist too. It's subtle compared to your standard nightlight and worked for me. Oh also there's lamps for sad or lamps that are meant to mimic moonlight or sunlight as someone else said. I think they can be timed to sunrise and sunsets and will gradually get brighter in the morning to wake you up. 

 I can sleep in the dark if I'm exhausted but not usually.. I'm not afraid of the dark but I used to sleep like that cept with curtains open and always had moonlight coming in..

I think everyone just assumes resources and chances are plentiful rather than practical. Some things are factual- your risks and gains in applying for a job, an education and even a social life. We know so many die alone and miserable even despite their hard work and fight. They still suffer for no reason and we dare judge it.
