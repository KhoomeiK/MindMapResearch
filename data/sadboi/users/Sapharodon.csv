It’s a 7 volume manga about a girl navigating life while deaf, and a boy who used to bully her badly back in the day (but now regrets it and wants to make amends). It just got a film adaptation that was very good too! 

“Your Name” (Kimi no Na Wa) is another good one. It’s a 3 volume long story of two students (a carefree Tokyo boy and a rural girl from a shrine family) switching bodies sporadically and living days in each others’ lives. Very warm-hearted and introspective, and also has a movie adaptation!

People who like things like “I Want to Eat Your Pancreas” or “Your Lie In April” tend to like these two series as well."

My solution is to just not bother with Reddit as much. I have way more fun talking FE (including 3H, Edelgard, etc) in community Discord channels with stricter rules about misogyny.

Always take Gamepress rankings with a grain of salt - IMO it’s a nice “eyeball guide” for beginners, but falls apart when evaluating characters in specific game modes (Arena, AR, etc). And don’t take “Tier 3” as a bad thing, most Tier 3 units are great in their own right."
gradadmissions,fpkav4i,t3_gdrsqn,1588691300.0,"Absolutely! I have a friend from Central Michigan University headed to UCLA in the fall. 

The name of your undergrad school means way less than the connections and experiences you develop. Make friends with professors from your field who care about you, take on internship and research opportunities, keep up your GPA, and you’ll be good. (Though I recommend you be optimistic about your undergraduate school, and not get hung up on rankings! Even “lower ranked” schools have strong programs and faculty to learn from.)"

That said, plenty of units have been planned/had art made long before their debut (Christmas Robin and Tharja were datamined over a year before their debut IIRC)."

That said, *many* mages can close that gap with a Bladetome kit. Even recent mages weren’t lucky enough to get PRFs (Ewan, Lugh, Hubert, etc) have solid statlines that run Bladetomes well. And old classics like Nino, Tharja, and Lilina are still plenty good. Yeah, they’re not a +Att Ophelia or whatever, but certainly worth building in the off-chance that you pull one (and easy to combo with your free Peony!)."
