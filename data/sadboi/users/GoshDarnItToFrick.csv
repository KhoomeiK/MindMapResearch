You do realize that the latter implies the former is false.

A few years ago a friend of mine got kicked out of both school and his home for doing drugs. He ended up in a hospital, and his life went downhill fast. He had developed that very attitude and got suicidal. He is clean now, and although he still has his personal issues he's in a far better place than he was back then.

Hell, even depressed people have a shot at living a fulfilling life with the right support system, therapy, and meds.

There have been ugly fat neckbeards that gained the will to get their life on track, start showering, shave, lose weight, and move out of their parents's basements too.

vegan,faf30lu,t1_faejue7,1576013464.0,"[u/K16180](https://www.reddit.com/user/K16180) beat me to the punch here but lemme just debunk the links you listed.

The first one is a video listing 10 reasons vegans are ruining the planet.

1. It cites [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-015-9577-y) study, claiming that lettuce consumption is more harmful to the environment than bacon consumption since it's much less Calorie-dense, meaning it needs to be consumed and produced in much larger quantities. The study grossly misinterprets the actual [USDA dietary guidelines](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf), which, surprise surprise, don't expect your Caloric intake to consists entirely of lettuce. When consumed in its ACTUAL recommended quantities (paired with other much denser foods) lettuce consumption is just a drop in the ocean compared to the [carbon footprint of meat-eaters.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263353807_Dietary_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_meat-eaters_fish-eaters_vegetarians_and_vegans_in_the_UK)
2. [Here's proof that humans consume only a fraction of the soybean we produce](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267220413_Economics_of_Soybean_Production_Marketing_and_Utilization). The soy animals consume doesn't just disappear after the animal is killed tho. It goes straight into meat-eaters bodies. [Btw, here's what phytoestrogens do to you](https://www.metabolismjournal.com/article/S0026-0495(02)00020-3/abstract). Spoilers, the things said in the video are completely bs and phytoestrogens are actually good for you!
3. Breaking news! [Almonds don't use jack shit compared to the amount of water consumed by crops mostly used as animal feed.](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report47-WaterFootprintCrops-Vol1.pdf)
4. I'm not even gonna grace this one with a study. Vegans aren't responsible for blood guacamole, criminals are.
5. This is just plain wrong. [Just look at the stats!](https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l4897)
6. B12 doesn't even come from animals! It's produced by the bacteria and archaea living in the dirt animals consume when grazing or drinking water from rivers. [Farm animals don't get to do these things as often as they should, so most of the B12 in their bodies comes from supplements put in their food.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287276245_Studies_on_oral_Vitamin-B12_supplementation_in_cows) As for the physical strength argument, I'd suggest watching the documentary [The Game Changers](https://www.netflix.com/bg/title/81157840). It debunks the misconception that a plant-based diet makes you weaker and even makes the case that going vegan actually improves athletic performance.
7. The video ignores the fact that [the study it cites](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088278) fails to find a casual relationship between dietary habits and those negative effects on mental health. Seriously, read through it.
8. As with number 4, this isn't an argument against veganism.
9. See my points above
10. As with 4 and 8, this is certainly horrible, but it's still not an argument against veganism.

The second video you link actually argues FOR veganism. Seeing that you don't even watch the videos you cite, I doubt that you'd ever go through any of the research I cited, so there's no point in debunking the other 3 links."

mentalhealth,faa7eyq,t1_fa9x33a,1575904115.0,"This service seems mega fishy.

For starters, while you claim to have collaborated with professors and top professionals in the field, you haven't cited any. Yes, you have provided contact info for us to send you questions, but I feel like information as important as the names of the medical professionals you've consulted when starting your company should be readily available on your website, either in its about page (which consists of 3 vague paragraphs btw) or directly linking from it. 

Secondly, you never refer to the people your clients would be talking to as licensed therapists, only as ""real empathetic human beings"". I'm really hoping that this was just negligence on your part or some stupid attempt at marketing and that Mango is manner by actual therapists (thought it's unlikely since your service is free and therapists work for compensation). Assuming that's not the case, guess what? Every human being is real and most of them are empathetic. Does this mean I'm willing to vent everything that's bothering me to a random person on the street? Of course not! The thing about therapists is that helping people overcome their issues is something they've been studying for and practising for the better part of their lives. They understand human behavior on a whole different level, and even they don't always know what to do. Bad therapy can be incredibly dangerous and risks worsening the situation. That's why you need a license to practice therapy.

Thirdly, the website's only listed service are 30 minute conversation sessions that let you get things off your chest. That's cool. That's also not how therapy works. Therapy is a lengthy process during which the therapist and their client form a unique kind of relationship. A therapist needs time to get to know and understand someone in order to help them. A 30 minute chat isn't going to cut it.

Lastly, a look through your comment history shows you advertising this thing constantly, even though self promotion is highly inappropriate in subs like this one and often comes off as manipulative. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're just trying to help. That's not how you help people. There are people trained to deal with these kinds of issues, but those people aren't random volunteers on a website that can't even cite its consultants."

The same principle applies to teenagers and even adults.

Showerthoughts,ewrdcah,t1_ewrcwba,1565702506.0,"A game mechanic exclusive to mega brutal. The more infected people there are, the more expensive everything becomes. It reaches its peak when the entire world is infected without any casualties. At that point, even cheap traits start costing more than 100 points each."
DankMemesFromSite19,ewr6k8j,t1_ewr53kr,1565696432.0,Aren't they doing it ironically tho?
Showerthoughts,ewr6bq1,t1_ewr5hb6,1565696180.0,"Someone hasn't been playing on Mega Brutal. Good luck ""flipping the genetic switch"" with the 60 DNA you've gathered during the infection stage after genetic drift has made everything unaffordable. Also, even on normal, the zombie plague type tends to mutate like crazy and devolving symptoms is an enormous DNA sink, especially since you need this DNA to counter the world discovering you at the first symptom you evolve/mutate and curing you in 9 nanoseconds."
ObraDinn,ewmzfzb,t3_cp3m07,1565564475.0,"Do you mean the guy that says: ""The beast is dead, your mate was torn apart""? You're required to go through his death memory in order to reach the memory in which the bosun's mate is mentioned. His death is recorded just a few pages after the first death in the chapter.

EDIT: You might also be trying to fill in the fate for the bosun's mate himself. In that case, make sure you've seen all memories in the chapter he dies in."
ObraDinn,ewfsthj,t3_co2xzl,1565366909.0,How did that shell end up in the sky?

TheMonkeysPaw,euaw269,t3_cfm7nd,1563633609.0,Granted. It only works on Reddit premium.
TheMonkeysPaw,euambg1,t3_cfjp0c,1563624983.0,Granted. It comes back with rabies and bites you.
AskReddit,eu7bnma,t1_eu6cg8f,1563525211.0,Depends. Did you look stupid and did he look unamused?
KatanaZero,ery5ao0,t1_erwpb8k,1561400741.0,What's that got to do with anything?
KatanaZero,erul8x1,t1_eruj5ai,1561286362.0,"He said he killed 7 nulls. He never said any of them killed him, ever. He did mention that one of them shot him 7 times, but we've seen him survive multiple slashes from Zero and a helicopter crash, so he could've easily tanked those shots and won. He was also most likely hunting Alphas and Betas."
KatanaZero,eruihfs,t1_ertqwmk,1561281827.0,How do you dodge laser walls tho?
KatanaZero,ert6jrm,t1_erswj9l,1561233823.0,"I mean, fair enough. We know he isn't on Chronos tho. He lacks precognition. We also know that although Chronos isn't the only superpower drug out there, it's the only drug Zero uses, and he has no problem pulling off dodge-rolls."
