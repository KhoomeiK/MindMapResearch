It’s so cool that a frequent poster here started as an indie scent admirer and has become a creator! Shipping was fast, i ordered 4/18 and got it 4/27, which made my WFH productivity for the day shot, lol. I can say I truly enjoyed everything I tried.

She Poisoned the Strawberries
Comments: This doesn’t smell instantly like strawberries, but i can kind of smell it lightly accenting if I inhale hard. I think the champagne note is more prominent for me. Throw is light and lasts 6-7 hrs on me. it dries down to a skin musk with slight fruitiness. 
Verdict: This one smells nice, but not as much like strawberries as I had hoped. Still pleasant, just not for me 7/10


The Soft Crunch of Bone and Bread
Comments: The name is strange, but so intriguing! It has a wonderful warm coconut and vanilla smell, but it’s not cloying. I think there must be a bread note keeps it grounded? I don’t get the macaron or green tea much, but it smells heavenly! Throw is medium, and lasted all day.
Verdict: I wanna smell like a warm bakery and love, will FS in the near future 10/10


Peach Queen
Comments: Ooh yeah, it smells like peach ring candy! It doesn’t come off as super realistic to my nose (I think it’s defective anyways), but that’s 100% fine with me. I think the musk note gives it that sugared quality. Throw is strong, but also I accidentally used a huge ass drop that was plenty for both wrists. it’s a feminine, juicy scent that will be perfect for summer! This is more what I wished Poesie’s Innocence had been like for me (beautiful, but too fleeting on my skin *cries*).This lasted 8 hrs on me, the peach note was very long lasting. 
Verdict: Peach Queen lives up to its name, I will most likely FS at some point 9/10


The Sweater We Buried You With Is Hanging in My Closet 
Comments: YESSSS let me put this all over myself!! I figured this would be a favorite by the description, and i was right! It’s incredibly cozy and a little bit sexy, I just want to inhale it. The throw is low, and it lasted my whole day. it really clings to fabric, so you’ll have this nice scent aura around you. D&F can do gourmands quite well!
Verdict: You need to try this one!! I will definitely FS this baby 10/10


Freebies
That First Morning Moment
Comments: I unfortunately don’t get any lavender and can only slightly detect some chamomile, but I definitely smell the white musk. Either way, it smells lovely and very comforting. This lasts all day on me, throw is low. This would make a good sleep scent, too. I hope upon my next use I’ll be able to smell the other notes.
Verdict: This could be a nice everyday scent, sometimes you want simple and beautiful. I will FS at some point 10/10


The People You Love Become Ghosts Inside of You
Comments: It starts of as being a light, creepy floral scent. I don’t know how to describe it, it’s disconcerting but in a good way. I don’t know if funeral flowers have a particular smell to them, but the definitely evokes that. This lasts for about 2-3 hours, then it becomes sweeter and slightly incense-y. Then, it becomes a sweet, slightly spiced honey smell. The notes on the product page are slightly different, the secondary listing mentions a honey note, so I think this description is the most accurate to the scent. It lasted about 7 hours on me, low throw.
Verdict: I really like honey, so that was a nice surprise. It’s a very unique scent and I love that it’s a bit unexpected. I don’t think I’ll FS but this was such a cool experience 8/10


Experience
Shipping was great, the bottles were intact and perfect. The scents were packed in such a sweet way! I LOVE the dropper bottles, they make is sooo much easier to sample and they’re adorable! I would caution not to squeeze up too big a drop if you want to be conservative, but to each their own! I think I'll use up my samples with this brand because I won’t have to use mini pliers to wrangle the lids off of vials. I’d love to see the dropper bottles remain as long as it’s reasonable for the owner. Customer service is great, Brim was so sweet in letting me choose the 2 extra samples I requested. I want to try a bunch of other scents she has, and I can’t wait to see what’s to come! The hype is REAL!!"

Proprietary Blend: what else but ""jasmine, lavender, rose hips, and a hint of Tahitian vanilla"" lol

Favorite Chair: worn-in polyester, light blonde hops, the saltiness of pretzels

Stop Staring at Me!: fur musk, wet grass, petrichor, dirt

Nervosa Rendezvous: espresso, cream, bitter dark chocolate note, pinch of oud, a whisper of cinnamon

Rozalinda, Queen of the Rozniac: jasmine, amber, red musk, Mexican vanilla, hint of leather,

Ludicrous Popinjay (alternatively, Niles Gotta Have It!): smooth rich Merlot, silk musk, a hint of musty paper from Niles' study

Love in the Moonlight: freshly-baked muffins, Earl Grey tea, hint of strawberries, vanilla base

I'm Listening (Seattle): petrichor, some blue musk, maybe some light sandalwood?? (idk how well these would go together)"

Indiemakeupandmore,flqwljv,t3_fqlqtx,1585407907.0,"This review is long overdue; I received my order about the 2nd week of January from the Black Friday sale. Alpha Musk was my first experience with indie perfume oils (aka, my gateway). I blind bought some full size scents/samples over 3 orders (I have no impulse control). I’m not great at describing/identifying notes but here are some reviews for ya!
 

Purchased
Scent: Goth, FS
Comments: Initially, I don’t get much vanilla, but I do smell muskiness and leather. It’s more “perfumey”, but that’s not a bad thing. The vanilla comes out more as the scent wears. Throw is strong and the scent is very decadent, so you don’t need much to make an impact. Lasts 8 hrs or so.
Verdict: This stuff is sexy and extra! I can imagine a vintage vamp wearing Goth; Sally Bowles or Velma Kelly come to mind. You probably should listen to “All that Jazz” while wearing this. 8/10
 

Scent: Heavenly Amber Superior (HAS), FS
Comments: OMGGG I think I’ve found an HG scent!!! Is this scent a Marvin Gaye song? Because mercy, mercy me! HAS is so rich, warm, and luxurious; even though there’s no vanilla or honey, I get those qualities. It also has an effervescent quality as it warms, which makes it even more magical. It has a medium-strong throw and lasted a good 8 hours. Warning: this will ruin you for all other ambers!
Verdict: Hell yes!!! I wish I could upsize and bathe in it! I know she's branching out into body butters; I would *love* to have this as an all-over product. 10/10
 

Scent: Sexy, FS
Comments: I get the red musk, but unfortunately not many of the other notes (this is likely my nose, not the scent itself), but I guess that means it’s well-blended. Medium to large throw, lasts about 7 hrs. It has a candy-like sweetness to it, which I normally wouldn’t like, but this isn’t sickly.
Verdict: I don’t get sexy as much, but regardless, I like the scent! 6/10
 

Scent: Shy, FS
Comments: YUM! Right out of the bottle it smells lovely! Smells like coconut vanilla cookies and is comforting. I love how warm and delicious it is! Medium throw, lasts about 7-8 hrs.
Verdict: This is a winner!! The only problem: you may get hungry while wearing it. 9/10
 

Scent: Cup of Tea Musk, FS
Comments: I was so excited for this one because I’m looking for a good tea scent, plus the label art was cool. I got heavy notes of the jasmine and bergamot, I couldn’t smell the green tea. it initially smelled like citrusy florals, which I think would be nice for spring/summer. Unfortunately after an hour or so, it started to smell like stale and bitter Sweet Tarts and I had to wash it off.
Verdict: This is a sad incident of my skin not jiving with the scent, I guess. I hope this scent works better for y’all than it did for me. 1/10.

 
Scent: Vulva Musk, FS
Comments: I’m so bad at describing scents, but it smells like sweet candy. Luckily it isn’t sickly or overly sugary. This is definitely an artistic interpretation of a vulva, not a realistic one lol. Medium throw, it lasted 6 hours on me before fading into a sweet muskiness. Tbh I kind of got this for the name.
Verdict: 7/10. It’s fun and different!

 
Scent: Extra, sample
Comments: this has a nice, woody smell to it. It lasted 7 hours and had medium throw. While this didn’t clash with my chemistry, I got a soapy note from it. Also, I don’t think this scent suits my personality as well as some of the others I tested.
Verdict: this one smelled fine, but I don’t think I would FS. 5/10

 
Scent: Youthful, sample
Comments: Nice vanilla smell with a slight effervescent quality to it. The cream soda note seemed to only last 2 hrs, which I wish could’ve lasted longer. This one only lasted around 4 hrs before fading to a pleasant vanilla close to the skin. All in all, it had medium throw.
Verdict: While pleasant, this one was rather forgettable, so I wouldn’t FS. 5/10
 

Scent: Earnest, sample
Comments: I can immediately smell the rose, though it isn’t too cloying or overpowering. I don’t smell the lemon or lavender, which I kinda wish I did. It had light-medium throw and lasted about 5-6 hours.
Verdict: While a pretty scent, it’s not for me. 5/10

 
Scent: Crazy, sample
Comments: I wasn’t initially crazy (pun intended) about this one, mostly because a bit of it leaked in transit and the first day I got my order, this was all I could smell. But when I did get around to testing it, I was pleased. I get the gardenia note, but the pistachio keeps it grounded. It’s a feminine scent with medium throw and lasting about 6 hrs at it’s strongest. By 8 hrs, the gardenia has faded and I was left with a creamy cake scent. I wish the pistachio note were more prominent, but this is so pretty and well-made!
Verdict: I don’t think I would FS, but I would definitely recommend if you like flormands! 7/10
 

Scent: Mood, sample
Comments: I really like this! It’s a great woodsy smell with the vanilla to soften things up. It smelled complex and sensual, very mysterious. It had medium-large throw on me and lasted 6-7 hours. Can I also say I love the green color of the oil?
Verdict: While I don’t think I will FS, I think this is a great scent and would be good for anyone who likes feminine-leaning wood scents. 7/10.
 

Freebies, 1ml
 
Scent: Wake Up Alone
Comments: this one is really intriguing, it initially has a coolness to it with a touch of floral. I don’t usually like florals, but this wasn’t overpowering or gross. I’m guessing the coolness was from the vodka or hairspray note? Is there menthol in this? After the top notes wear, it’s like a sweet musk with that hint of floweriness. This would be a good floral scent for people who don’t like florals.
Verdict: I enjoyed this more than I expected! It’s like a tough gal who wears a leather biking jacket but has a tenderness inside. I don’t think I would FS, but it is a great scent! 7/10.
 

Scent: Rice Milk Musk
Comments: no notes on her site, but I hope she releases this in the future because I love it! It’s very light with low throw, I can still smell it after 7 hours, though I have to put my nose close to my wrist. Do I detect a non gourmand vanilla or cherry blossom? My olfactory skills are really being tested haha! It’s very clean, and I can definitely see this as a great sleep scent or my skin but better musk.
Verdict: I love this and will definitely FS if/when it becomes available! 9/10

 
Scent: Mellow Blue Musk
Comments: It’s actually blue!! There is a heavier, bluer portion of the oil that needs to be mixed before application, and it reminds me of a lava lamp! I’m really glad I got this as a freebie since many people liked this. It’s a sweet but not too sweet marshmallow with a surprisingly not gourmand vanilla. Throw is light-medium, but this stuff clings to clothing and lasts 8 hrs on me. It’s definitely a great sleep scent and not offensive at all.
Verdict: I love love love this! I went FS. 10/10
 

Scent: Warm Egyptian Cashmere Musk
Comments: This has a very similar quality to HAS, which I like. I thought I got a fleeting whiff of coconut, but maybe that’s just me..? it’s very cozy and gentle, almost sugared. HAS is more sexy, while this one is more sweet. Super glad I got this as a sample!
Verdict: At first I wasn’t going to FS because I had HAS, but I said, “screw it!” and upsized (again, I lack impulse control). 10/10
 

Scent: Catwalk
Comments: Ooh, this is so beautiful! I didn’t know violets had a smell, but if this is any indication, I totally dig it! This isn’t cloying at all, it’s very romantic and feminine. If I close my eyes and sniff, I catch a bit of woodiness that makes this more complex. The top floral notes last maybe 3-4 hours before it drifts into a sweet vanilla base; overall it lasted about 6 hours. This would make a lovely first date perfume (not that I know much about those…) I wouldn’t have chosen it, but I’m glad it was included!
Verdict: Many people say Bardot is the floral scent for people who hate florals, but have they tried Catwalk? I feel this is one of Alpha Musk’s more slept-on scents, definitely try it! I decided to FS. 10/10

 
Scent: Pepper Rose
Comments: This rose scent has a cool, nitro (?) feel to it. The pepper scent isn’t too apparent, but I think its presence keeps everything from being overpowering or old lady-ish. I actually wish Earnest had smelled more like this. Throw was light and lasted about 5 hrs or so. The label art indicates it’s part of a line called Naturals.
Verdict: While a decent rose scent, I don’t think it’s for me. This is a great scent if you like rose but don’t want to smell like your grandma or super feminine. 5/10
 

Scent: Dizzy Dust
Comments: *This scent is now available, but notes were not listed when I received it* The label art indicates this is also part of the Natural line like Pepper Rose. This had light throw and lasted about 4-5 for me. I got medicinal cherry from this, though it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. I asked my mom to smell my wrist, and she said it smelled like vanilla. Now that the notes are online, I’m surprised vanilla WAS in this; I obviously don’t know anything haha.  
Verdict: This scent is cold and unique, but not for me. 5/10


TAT was long, which I expected. Sarabeth kept me in the loop about any delays, which I appreciated (tangent: I also dig all her Maryland/Baltimore references). It was worth the wait, and I loved most of what I got. Even if there were scents I wasn’t crazy about, they were all very well-made and tended to work with my skin chemistry. Thanks so much for reading!"
Anxiety,flptdxu,t3_fq8z5a,1585368277.0,"Yup, I struggle with essentially everything you said. The problem with me is that I'm anxious, lazy, *and* forgetful when it comes to communication like this. That means one or more of these issues will lead to me having a delayed response or an unopened message. I wish I could get better, especially with regards to being anxious, but I don't know to get better."

But on the off chance you do, I want to say that you're still my favorite O's player and that you're so missed in Baltimore. You seem like a stand-up dude! What's your favorite food/s in Japan?"
washingtondc,fl7nmr5,t3_fn47q5,1584905493.0,"Even before the virus stuff, I would get incensed whenever I went down there to see the blossoms because so many assholes were disrespecting the trees. I saw people climbing on them, picking the flowers, pulling the branches to get them in their selfies, a child straight-up pulling a branch behind his arms and leaning back into it... It was disheartening to see, to say the least."

My mental health is definitely not stable, but it's been considerably better while in my current position. It's the best job I've had so far, and I don't want to lose it. I'm afraid for other businesses, especially local ones. All the measures to prevent the virus from spreading are needed, but they're obviously not conducive to encouraging people to spend money."
