britishproblems,fkfkxoe,t1_fkdnwtu,1584136700.0,"They only clean 1 level of the hospital (3 in total) and they don’t tend to carry any hand sanitiser. Until today, of course!"
britishproblems,fkfko6s,t1_fkdnhqb,1584136534.0,100% - they’re the only people who know the door code aside from me and my manager. They’ve been reported.
depression,f4uphk1,t3_dlp6ws,1571822696.0,"This is actually really interesting, and I didn’t know others had the same. I have fibromyalgia and often put mine down to “fibro fog”, but actually it is so much more than just forgetting the word for something or simply “spacing out” 😮"
whatsthisbug,f3jkte6,t1_f3j3yfb,1570954280.0,Solved!
whatsthisbug,f3jinsn,t1_f3j3yfb,1570953325.0,Solved! Thank you - there’s lots of pesky ants on my balcony too so that explains a lot!
Fibromyalgia,eyt4w90,t3_cyjpm9,1567425086.0,"Oh 100%! Just had 2 weeks off work and was dreading my 6:30am alarm this morning. I usually hit snooze a couple of times. However, woke up naturally at 6am and feel a million times better for it. If only I could do that every day!"
frozendinners,eyprqco,t3_cy2dhv,1567309055.0,"I’ll have to give this a go, looks quite good. Have you tried Hearty Food Co pizzas? Only 67p for a pepperoni or cheese pizza and actually quite tasty!"
Fibromyalgia,exvl2jf,t1_exuyxds,1566601328.0,"Ouch! I’m sorry to hear that :(
And thank you - luckily it’s bank holiday weekend here in the UK so I can do just that!"
Fibromyalgia,exsaa39,t1_exs7pvm,1566537465.0,Thank you :) that does make sense about the emergency crew only respecting much worse injuries 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m going to try see my regular GP today for further advice
Fibromyalgia,exsa50e,t1_exs5cbt,1566537322.0,"Thank you! That looks a little difficult for me but hey, I’ll give it a shot!"

drunk,evwhuzk,t1_evwh3mb,1564864487.0,Alright.. Vincent he shall remain
drunk,evwgqf9,t1_evwdlm0,1564863670.0,He’s only got half an ear on the right side.. Vincent Van Gogh. But Edward is such a good name!
drunk,evwd21v,t1_evw8sk9,1564861053.0,"Seriously considering changing his name to Edward... but no, his name is Vincent"
Fibromyalgia,evw3i4o,t1_evvcz6i,1564854197.0,"Exactly this though! Just recently a colleague of mine got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and the level of sympathy given to her has been 1000x more than when I got diagnosed. I don’t go around looking for pity or attention, but still annoyed me an awful lot.
So with you 100% but still felt the image was super relevant to me."
Fibromyalgia,ev7cnoy,t1_ev3c3z1,1564258056.0,Thank you :) it’s just good to know that I’m not alone!
Fibromyalgia,ev7chb5,t1_ev4dzo1,1564257991.0,That’s interesting! But obviously I feel for you here. I never had an MRI scan myself but I might ask to have one
Fibromyalgia,ev7c4wl,t1_ev3t2h3,1564257869.0,"I’d describe it as a dull achy pain starting at the lower back all the way down the leg and even to the toes. The sciatic nerve runs from the butt through the thigh. Usually 1 sided - thankfully, I guess, I’ve not had to suffer both sides at once!"
CasualUK,eu4eaai,t3_ceq5um,1563451011.0,"I’ve got one too, but are they actually worth anything? Will probs end up going in the vending machine at work like all my change does."
