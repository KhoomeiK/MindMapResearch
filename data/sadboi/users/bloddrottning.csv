dykesgonemild,fqkr959,t3_gjdqgf,1589434075.0,You have a genuinely friendly smile! I was a bit down today but you looking happy made me feel happier.
prettyaltgirls,fqb6sj6,t1_fqb6iyf,1589231581.0,"Not too long actually! The dress is just like a shirt, I can just slip a petticoat on underneath, do up the shirt, and the socks and choker are easy."
GothGirls,fqb3gco,t1_fqb18m8,1589229915.0,"Thank you! I got them from Killstar as a treat the other day, they totally wrecked my feet trying to break them in on the walk though haha"
dykesgonemild,fq37anr,t3_ggih5h,1589063677.0,THOSE BOOTS heck yeah I'm also a boot wearing WLW but I'm baby
progresspics,fpc7nna,t1_fpc1vhq,1588490382.0,"Thank you! It's a pesky poster that likes to fall down in the night and scare me a lot. I think the filter I used on my before pic makes them look blue, but they're actually very dark brown! I've always wanted blue eyes, but I'm embracing my dark voids haha. Thank you c:"
dykesgonemild,fpc0uyr,t1_fpbw84f,1588484095.0,It's a custom dress made by KissOfDoom on Etsy! She remakes metal band shirts into dresses c:
progresspics,fpbs2ny,t1_fpbrw8n,1588477308.0,"Huh. I did think swimsuits are SFW but was unsure what the mods stance on that may be. So I'm a bit confused haha, sorry, I'm new here."
progresspics,fpbq8sm,t1_fpbp35b,1588476019.0,"Whoops sorry, I'm confused! I'm new to Reddit, do you mean I should put an NSFW tag on the post?

EDIT: Just did it c: took me a bit haha. Thanks for the reminder!"
progresspics,fpbofob,t1_fpbnyk3,1588474759.0,"Ah, it may be to do with the type of medication then. I think some increase appetite and others make you store fat differently. May be talking out my butt though, I swear I've read that somewhere! And no worries, always down for a chat."
dykesgonemild,fpbnxyu,t3_gcbu0z,1588474424.0,I'm having glasses envy! Those are some very nice glasses haha. Also I love your hair!
progresspics,fpbm5ft,t1_fpbljd4,1588473218.0,Thanks so much!!
progresspics,fpblvyl,t1_fpbl49j,1588473041.0,"I'm actually still on them, just a different type! For me, I stopped binge eating and starting taking up running and walks. The weight piled on because I was hungry all the time and gave into it. I had to control myself and that was really hard. I hope that's helpful to you c:

EDIT: just remembered that the type I'm now on isn't known to cause weight gain, but I did manage to lose most of the weight while still on the antidepressants that made me gain so much. So it is possible! If you're on a journey yourself, I wish you the best of luck."

GirlswithNeonHair,foosw14,t3_g8g5mw,1587945758.0,I think pink really suits you! Blue would be cool maybe? Or purple! I'm thinking of dying my hair too ðŸ–¤
u_Starryfawnn,fomwh2i,t3_g80mab,1587905981.0,You're so pretty!
EatingDisorders,flpulqz,t1_flpt733,1585369272.0,Reading really helps me too! It's very easy to get lost in the world of the book and not think about food as you say. I'm glad you find that helpful too. I always feel productive after I've finished a book haha. It's a win win situation really!
EatingDisorders,flodg4w,t3_fpt4sl,1585336168.0,"I'm in exactly the same position, only I'm living with my parents so I don't have control over what we do and don't buy. My dad is a control freak and loses his cool when he catches me binging, which makes it more embarrassing and upsetting.
Recently I bought a video game on sale, and I've been playing that to help me through cravings. I'm also learning a language, you may find learning and disciplining yourself in other areas can help with learning to ignore cravings.
I've found the cravings don't stop and sometimes I fall for them but you can learn to ignore them. Most of all, I found restricting to compensate for binging was unhelpful and made things worse. Like everyone always tells you, regular meals are better, but it's hard to take in sometimes!"
EatingDisorders,flhkkj1,t3_fifqok,1585164426.0,"Personally, I've been binge eating a LOT since the UK went on lockdown. I'm very stressed and anxious about the whole situation, and unfortunately one of my coping mechanisms is to overeat. This in turn triggers more anxiety, so it's a vicious circle, haha. I'm not sure if you would find this helpful, but for me I've been keeping in touch with my boyfriend and trying to exercise everyday with him (not over-exercise, just a nice medium). I've found that even though I'm eating a lot, I don't feel as bad knowing that I'm at least exercising a little. I'm very worried that the lockdown will trigger a bad relapse though."
