i saw your previous posts and tbh i suggest learn some syntax at least. or pick up a textbook and practicing their problems cus bootcamps are OK. i wish i did that...
i suggest you start programming despite any college you go to tho. it's really fun if u create a project as u learn maybe?"
CUNY,foty9ri,t1_fotxeuc,1588070410.0,"I'm not sure how the other colleges are tbh, I'm sorry. 

Lol but I don't mean to scare you tho. I'm sure I did a little. There are tons of people with good grades in my classes. Many of my friends have straight A's and B's. CCNY gives u a taste of the real world and people are friendly.

It's really challenging but once you step foot in it you grow accustomed to it. It's cus you're not here that u don't know yet."
CUNY,fotx7it,t1_fotvs2m,1588069350.0,"Uhh let's see. There are three professors. Yuksel who you don't get projects in but hard af exams and a big ego, Peter Brass who I'm taking rn, and another professor who is nice but can't teach.

Algs isn't hard. It's that the professor makes the class unbearable. He isn't approachable otherwise it feels like you're bothering him. My friend said her assignment was rejected by him until he accepted it after the third complaint... It passed his test cases too, he just didn't approve of the code (despite not having guidelines). The third programming assignment, only seven people of the thirty five in my class submitted it.. we had three weeks to finish it AND he extended the deadline. It's old school teaching style. His lectures are just time complexity, inductive reasoning problems. But it's passable.

Learn algorithms yourself for job tech interviews.

I know some people who plan on graduating ""on time"" and most who may enter their fifth year. It really depends on if you get the class you want though. I can't take paradigms yet because all the classes for it are full."
CUNY,fotuvo6,t3_g4epvg,1588066965.0,"CCNY's is really challenging. 103 was a weed out class for sure. Don't take it without any programming experience. I loved data structures because it helped hone my interest and understanding of C++. I also liked the professor. Algorithms with Peter Brass won't teach you much though. He gives u problems but doesn't check if u need further help. 
That's a class you have to teach yourself in 100%. The other classes are pretty neat tho. Just remember that the science classes here are also weed out classes. Bio 101 was really hard, bio 102 is super interesting though. For physics I have a superb friend who failed an exam with a 30 and had to study physics every single day to get an A+ in that class.

Anyway so far yeah CCNY is challenging. Some people hate it. I like it tbh I just bring my own food from home 2 eat. My GPA is terrible though but that doesn't represent a good chunk of the students. Most of the professors I've taken haven't been trash but I'm just lucky."

CoronavirusUS,fnvnw1a,t3_g46gfr,1587299857.0,"I study computer science at CUNY. I come from New York and was raised in New York. Racially I'm Dominican, though I don't associate myself with the culture too much. I commute to college by bus or train, but mostly bus. I do not have siblings, just live with my mother and father. I don't have a job but I am part of a startup which now has limitations as to how far we can make it. I do believe climate change has been affected- less air pollution, more plastic waste. Some additional information is that I actually do enjoy quarantining. I could stay inside forever as long as good food is accessible to me.

I have ADHD now and had severe depression in the past, which has improved immensely. It caused me to isolate a lot and learn to think of the worse case scenarios for many situations. As much as I like quarantining, I worry about regressing to a prior state I don't want to revisit again. Not sure if it has anything to do with it but I'm lower class and have a low GPA. 

The biggest issue with COVID-19 is how dynamic the virus is. Mild symptoms for one person may be fatal for another, making it easy to spread. My family and I did contract COVID-19 for three weeks. My dad still has a cough but it isn't so bad now... But it could get worse worse again, easily. Everytime I had breathed in, my lungs were in pain, and my parents were in denial which was a huge bummer and concern at the beginning. We did get asthma medication though, so it's okay. (I love them but they are not the brightest. It's where I get my dullness from. 🙃)

My mom and dad still work, but my dad only works one day of the week as a peace officer (well, he did) while my mom works in HR and has piles of work to do related to the virus. I have a friend whose father had passed away and neighbors who passed away. A famous mathematician, Jon Conway, had passed away as well, which leads me to study his work some more. I'm sure more people I don't talk to are in pain right now. A lot of those I do talk to are lonely, but many of their lives haven't changed much.

Edit: some minor mistakes but I had made a mistake. I think the future will be bleak for many Americans. Not so much for people in let's say Vietnam, because their government has conducted proper protocols to protect eachother. I seriously hate how America is handling this. We need to enforce more government action. People are hurting themselves and one another. People are selfish."

CCNY,fn939kp,t1_fmis1fk,1586757956.0,"I took bio 1 incoming freshman year as a non premed with Professor Firooznia. I found that this class is way harder than bio 2, which I'm taking now. Bio 2 is twice the reading in comparison but the exams are multiple choice (so emphasis on reading and the homework questions is really important) and the lessons overall feel more intuitive and interesting. You also get lab exams and quizzes which aren't terrible (in MY experience anyway).

There were times I didn't think I would pass Bio 1. Even though I was reading, I recently had ADHD diagnosed and now realize what a hard time I had in consuming the material in a timely fashion. I would have to reread everything even after reading already because nothing came to me. Anyway, the exams consisted of essays as high school does, and mixed types of questions, and you have to do reading of articles on top of the work. My lab TA was pretty strict about following guidelines- so FOLLOW the lab manual if you go to CCNY for bio. It's a passable class if you take passable courses around it. Most people I talked to in Bio 2 got pretty good grades in Bio 1

Regarding campus life, I am part of a startup incubator on campus and it has made the semester much more entertaining for me. Otherwise it's a bit lackluster, so you have to force people to talk to you or do the activities they send via email. You do see high schoolers and middle schoolers in the area if that turns you off FYI, and there aren't that many great restaurants around (you're in the middle of Harlem y'know) but it's sufficient. Sounds ridiculous but I do homework on commute sometimes, it passes by time, but honestly it's tiring so meh.
