StarWarsBattlefront,evaznzs,t1_evaou1p,1564361738.0,So vader is super reliant on his choke like i just said he was and he blocks alot especially during rapid fire as you mentioned. Knock em down with detonite and shoot him on the wake up to negate the healthbuff. You could use shoulder charge towards vader but then youre gonna be up close with a vader. What decent blaster is going to run towards a lightsaber?

StarWarsBattlefront,evaobmb,t1_ev94njw,1564352855.0,Vader is a pretty easy target for a competent han player. His head is so big that it makes  headshots stupid easy. You can kite him around because hes so slow and when he hides behind his block you blow him up. The only way he stands a chance is if he can land his choke on you.

StarWarsBattlefront,epo95o7,t3_bv6cgf,1559340452.0,Unpopular opinion- Anakin is in a pretty good place right now and does not need a nerf. The other heroes/villians need to be improved. Leia's grenade has been trash since day one and its still trash. Mauls throw has been trash since day one. Lukes repulse-trash since day one. And thats just off the top of my head.
