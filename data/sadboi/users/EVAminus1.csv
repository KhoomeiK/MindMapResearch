I think I am doing much much better now. Whenever I felt it was too much, I calmed myself and thought about it for a bit and then I was fine.
Again thank you so much for talking to me back then. 
In order to distract me from everything, I focused on changing myself and try to be the best version of myself. I think it is working pretty well. Sorry for the tangent haha but really thank you for what you did back then, I will always appreciate that."

I found friends i could laugh with. I was an up and coming drummer in our orchestra with a lot of potential. I quit because it was too stressful, i still do drums as a hobby though. 
Because of those drumsticks i did end up discovering my passion or what i feel like i was meant to do(as stupid as that sounds) 
After i quit i started skating and things happened and now i'm part of the national team of a small country. I am in a good place i know but i just wanted someone to lean on i guess. Now i don't know what to do. I am envious of those that have the courage to die. I wish i had that courage but i am only a coward.
Thank you though, like i don't think anyone's ever tried to understand me. Really, thank you so much. I wish i had met you sooner. I don't know what to say except thank you. Even if i'm not doing okay, i hope you have a good life. Thank you so much."

manga,fh7dwv1,t1_fh6ru1h,1581326772.0,Have you read <Senryuu Shoujo>? I caught up to it just recently. It is about a girl who can only talk in 5-7-5 verses who gets close to a former delinquent. There is plenty of fluff here even before they inevitably get together! The cast of characters are pretty fun and the jokes made me smile or chuckle. Do give it a try sometime!
manga,fh7do25,t3_f1cdbn,1581326406.0,"Finished <Jitsu wa Watashi wa> after dropping it for a looooong time, don't even know why i dropped it as it's pretty damn good. It's a nice romcom that knows how to make you laugh with its over the top humor and make you ball your eyes out with its surprisingly beautiful art and story. Definitely give this a read if you're into romcoms/harems

Edit:Though i say this is a harem, the main character does get together with the main girl (and continues after that too!)

I also recommend <Hayate no Gotoku> if you liked it, although it is way longer with 500+ chapters. Same author who did <Tonikaku Kawaii>"

I don't really know about the other genres since i'm more of an JRPG guy but for general stuff:

Smash Ultimate is really fun, especially with friends.
 Mario Maker 2 just released and i hear it's fun is on par with BOTW.
 Daemon x Machina looks really cool if you like giant robots fighting giant robots.
 Astral Chain looks like an instant classic if all the news articles is true.
 There's also going to be a Link's Awakening remake that looks like claymation.

But if you still aren't sure if you like the games mentioned, then you can watch a nintendo direct or something to get a feel of all the games.
