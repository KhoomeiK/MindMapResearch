I'd definitely use Ableton over audacity if you have access to it. Try processing both parts together (group the tracks, throw a compressor and limiter on the group).

Setting up a reverb send might help hide a jarring cut... other than that you could try a short delay right around the switch, or just use envelopes to automate volume for the switch (or just use Abletons built in crossfade by grabbing top corners of clips where they touch in arrangement view).


Or if all that fails send me the clips because im in quarantine and have nothing better to do :)"
