The only thing she’s ever had immediate issue with is the vampire gloves. Her issue wasn’t a moral or ethical one, she didn’t say I shouldn’t use them, so I think the image of their actual use freaked her out a little lol. She’s not a sexual masochist, and that’s totally fine. She has expressed concern in the past that she is concerned my practice of sadomasochism is detrimental to my sobriety from self-harm, but I’ve assured her that’s not the case at all and she’s never shamed me about it or any such thing. She is very accepting of my sexual preferences and I think is glad I’m so open, especially with my husband/dom, since honesty is really important for therapist/patients relationships and romantic relationships."

For some people, all kink all the time is the only thing they’ll accept, and some people just want kink sometimes. Kink is a big spectrum in a lot of ways, so I’d say you need to talk to your girlfriend and have her tell you where she falls on the kink spectrum. If she wants a kink-heavy relationship and you don’t, maybe you guys need to have a talk about how sexually compatible you are.

Anyway, I’m also a sexual masochist who struggles with self-harm. I do not allow them to overlap, and, as such, do not engage in knife play or cutting in my sexual practices. For me, self-harm and sexual masochism are not the same, not only because they’re different actions, but also because the motivations and outcomes are different. My self-harm is rooted in my anxiety and mental health issues and is a very bad coping mechanism that has time after time proven unhelpful and destructive. My sexual masochism is rooted in pleasure, of course, but also in emotionally connecting with my partner (my husband) and trusting him. The self-harm destroys, and the sexual masochism builds up.

Please do not engage in cutting for sexual purposes; you are lying to yourself and trying to give yourself an excuse to do something you know you shouldn’t do (Imo). Please try to keep self-harm and sex separate."
