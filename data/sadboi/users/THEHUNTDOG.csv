lexapro,fj93kro,t3_fc5jfr,1583130833.0,Hi friend. I was also a morning user but found I wasn’t able to concentrate at work from being drowsy. I swapped to immediately after work around dinner time and found the drowsiness started hitting at the perfect time for sleep.

ffxiv,fi4eu38,t1_fi3w495,1582139761.0,Honestly the easiest fix would just be to phase out player models when they are watching cut scenes. Most people aren’t AFK just watching some good story
relationship_advice,fcm0fre,t1_fcm08rh,1577760998.0,I appreciate your suggestion that’s something I would like to schedule soon.
lexapro,fad6gb2,t3_e8k1om,1575957146.0,"man 3 months is a really long time to be taking this medication and still feeling bad. I feel you should reconvene with your doctor to attempt something new. Anti depressants are weird and this specific one may not be it for you, no shame in that just keep it up until you find your perfect balance! Good luck friend."
Anxiety,f0onmu2,t1_f0olyi4,1568815920.0,Adderall in the morning when I feel I need to focus. Lexapro at 4 pm
Anxiety,f0nrd9u,t1_f0npkn3,1568778204.0,"I feel that, finding your medicine is hard. But remember it can take up to 4 weeks to see effects. Try to stick it out unless the symptoms are unbearable"
Anxiety,f0nfz5k,t1_f0n4cgn,1568769072.0,"I won't say Lexapro was like flipping a switch. It's not very drastic but after the on boarding period I just found that in combination with an amphetamine salt, I am able to think much much more clearly and push out intrusive thoughts that only hinder my life.

I guess the meds just really helped me focus on what is happening right this moment and allows me to enjoy the present so much more.

Edit: I totally missed side effects. Lexapro CRUSHED me the first week. I had to reduce my Adderall dose because I was getting the worst panic attacks where I literally was close to having my SO bring me to the hospital. As well as the traditional sex drive/ appetite change, these lasted about a week and now things are much better."
Anxiety,f0nfsmy,t1_f0n2ene,1568768933.0,Please do! I know its really scary at the beginning.
Anxiety,f0muj0b,t3_d5gro2,1568753454.0,"If it's any help, the entirety of last year I found myself unable to enjoy anything. I couldn't go out because all I could think of was how pointless it all was. How all my friends and family would one day die and this moment would be forgotten in a year anyway. It truly felt to me like life was just suffering. I hated my job, my relationship, and my life even though I had everything I could ever want at 24. 

In the midst of a panic attack alone in my apartment, I finally realized that I wanted to die instead of suffering through life. But I was afraid. I realized I really don't want to die OR live like this.

For the first time, I said fuck it, and decided if I was going to die I would at least try to seek help first.

Today I am on an adderall and lexapro and I can easily say my life is so much better. I highly urge you talk to someone about your feelings. life is so much more than just a waiting room, but you have to discover that for yourself. 
Please reach me if you need help."

I don't have issues getting 200+ matches for the most part but they aren't really the type of girls I'm looking for. Help me up my game to the high tier and I'll buy you a marg

lexapro,er3tz6u,t3_c0c8hd,1560472633.0,I've definitely heard some precautionary tails about shrooms and SSR boosters. But I micro and trip after 6 months on Lexapro and haven't noticed much difference in the effects. Of course just have a sitter and possibly a benzo on hand and be safe!
