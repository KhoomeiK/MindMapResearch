We both apologized, but since she'd working with the other guy for three months, she felt I was the one that she needed to go to my new director and complain about. 

So when I had a one-on-one with my manager this morning he made sure to communicate that to me (that I had interrupted a VP, and she was *not happy about it*).... obviously, interrupting someone is rude, and it was not my intention to speak over her. Of course for the record, she did so in return, but the culture here is definitely that anyone in seniority has that right to flex on those lower on the totem pole.

The point being, I just started in the role, and she felt compelled to get me in trouble at the outset. 

In turn, I'm glad she revealed her true colors so I know how she is, but it's that type of backbiting and undermining that tell me I won't stay with this company for long."
