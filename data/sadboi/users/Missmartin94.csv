Things maybe tough right now but remember after a storm comes a rainbow (silly, I know) but honestly you’ve made it this far and I’m sure you’ve have many moments like this and you’re still here so keep fighting! You’ve got this 💪🏼"

Back rubs, definitely! Help (for me) 
Just little errands that will help them not have to do so much as day to day tasks or even just being awake can be tiring. 

Hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions if I’ve not covered a lot ☺️ it’s very thoughtful of you to put a post up so I’m sure that’ll be appreciated too"

But, there is now endopartners that’s been created, there’s not many posts but hope it helps!"
endometriosis,fgmokjx,t3_eyreuk,1580928839.0,"A listening ear, it can seem quite repetitive but I guess affirmations and support in general helps. 

Cuddles, back rubs, hot water bottles, baths. Stuff like that also just little jobs around the house that you don’t have to worry about doing when you’re in pain. 

It’s really lovely of you to be doing so much research into this for her, 
I myself am quite stubborn and resistant to wanting to receive help/ make out I’m in as much pain as I am all the time as, as I said it’s quite repetitive an I don’t wanna be annoying but from my personal experience it’s nice to have someone who can see through this, I guess don’t be afraid to “nag” her, keep asking if she’s ok and if you can help it’s important for her to feel like you’re her “safe place” not a lot of people understand this and to be honest many people don’t even try, or they see it’s not curable and right it off but there’s so many more aspects to it and to be honest, that’s the last thing we need. We need somebody who’s going to understand we’re going to wake up tired, have mood swings, ache everywhere etc 
Living with this is a massive weight on us too and it’s difficult to come to terms with that this is forever, y’know? 
It’s quite easy for someone to assume you’re pissed off or in a mood as when I’m in a lot of pain I go quiet and just go into myself. 

Sorry for the long reply, but I hope this helps!"

Endopartners,ffuj41t,t1_ffuijyp,1580243036.0,"It is yeah, it’s one of the most loneliest things to be honest, the flare ups are horrific and unless you say every 5-10 minutes you’re in pain then people assume you’re ok unless you’re physically unable to move. It’s the assumptions that get me with people that can be really hurtful too. 
So to know that you’ve got people to talk to that understand it, or in your case want to understand it for your SO is a great way to escape from the loneliness of it all"
Endopartners,ffuiegk,t3_evaojt,1580242605.0,"All the little things you do I’m sure she really appreciates, you’re right though there’s not much you can do to “fix” it for her like you’d want too I’m sure but the main thing she needs and probably wants is just your support which sounds like you’re already providing her with. 

I’m sorry for the losses you’ve both had to suffer it’s not nice, I myself have been lucky enough to have 2 kids and so I understand your struggles. 

My response probably isn’t that helpful but didn’t wanna just read and scroll 🙂"

endometriosis,fchix7l,t3_efxp8z,1577650867.0,"How lovely of you to want to get to know what you can do to help, be more informed on this. 

It’s nice of you to just research it let alone post in here about it! Very empathetic of you and a good trait to have. It’s also going to help your girlfriend as it’s just nice for someone to atleast want to understand than to not understand because they can’t “fix” you.. it’s just nice having someone to rant too/cry too and to be held and nothing more 

The bad days are excruciating and can come on or off your period and it varies but each girl with endometriosis is different. 
My lower back really hurts so back rubs would really help, just small gestures we don’t expect a miracle ☺️ 

Pain killers might not help her, I know they don’t help me. 
so just let hold her and let her cry it out but ask her what her symptoms are so you can get a better understanding of her personal battle with it."
