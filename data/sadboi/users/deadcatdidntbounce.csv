That which you describe is certainly harassment, at least under the UK/EU definition. Paraphrased it says someone shouldn't (repeatedly) do something that they know to cause upset, or incite someone else to do it for them. It's a civil and criminal offense in many places.

In many countries it's reasonably easy and very cheap for someone to make the application without needing a lawyer if you have a reasonable (-18 yo) education.

Obviously you will need the appropriate jurisdiction, which may be the biggest problem.  Some friendly jurisdictions will provide a mirror order for the order you already have as a paper  exercise.

With such an order it is then a reasonably easy matter to approach his communication provider, whether he is using it or not to send the emails, and flash the order (depends what you have asked for in your application)

Be aware, that it will never stop someone sending correspondence deemed to genuinely be legal resolution related. For example, if you have a harassment order granted it will not provide a remedy for that person writing respectfully to you (once) about a debt that is alleged or a child contact issue.

I mostly use music streaming on my phone, but it's great on the something that will fill the room. It's a built-in on the Yamaha.

I couldn't find a flatpak (main distro is Fedora as I get older, but still think well of Debian) and only happened upon the snap in passing. I'll have another look for you.

The Kodi install is proving rather more cumbersome atm. But if the Yamaha works then I'm ok with that."
TIdaL,fmge7j0,t1_fmgcoti,1586047047.0,"Thank-you I'll look into that.  Ok found it! Thank-you again.

Spotify is not a bad music collection, but they keep messing with the Android app in inexplicable ways. For example removing the ability to tell the app that you don't want a particular track played again ever; it came back in a subsequent release but sheesh!

I've been with Spotify for some years.
Tidal pays much more to the artists is really what swings it to me.

Presently sitting watching TuneMyMusic transfer the playlists over. It's really much slower than I expected but I have much too much time on my hands, with COVID-19!  TuneMyMusic seems to be the most often recommended service I see."

I'm not sure when you last knowingly used Linux, but perhaps you should look again.

I have a Linux phone, you might see it referred to by the trademark name, Android. It has a standard apk that you can download from the tidal website. 

There's a Linux snap package for tidal, but I haven't tried it.

I know of a Linux command-line tidal client.

I use LibreELEC to run Kodi. It has a tidal add-on. 

My Yamaha AV runs Linux, It will stream tidal as is.


I haven't bothered to look any further. You could Google any of your devices with tidal to find out."

Check!

> the algorithm will start making suggestions. 

That is all I wanted, thank-you.  Where do I find the algorithm ""playlist""?

I haven't listened to very much tidal music so there's nothing for the algorithm to predict from yet. 

I was mainly attracted by the Linux compatibility."
