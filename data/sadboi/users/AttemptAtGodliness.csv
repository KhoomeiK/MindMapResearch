Current (partially with her for a relapse and partly for other issues) is doing very well for me in just a few sessions so far. I wouldn’t rely on a school counselor as a baseline, honestly, since their attention is going to be too divided compared to a private practice. 

I’m sorry if that was taken the wrong way. I meant it in a sense that there’s no deadline for it. Also, if it helps I am actively waiting for marriage and not dating, so you’re not just looking at an example of people not improving. Honestly based on your effort applied, I’m optimistic that you’re going to find someone because you’re going to find a good strategy.
