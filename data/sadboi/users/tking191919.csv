gamernews,fqr48nx,t1_fqqvk4p,1589577296.0,"Nioh 2 takes place before Nioh, so you don’t really need to know a damn thing story/character wise to jump right into the second game.  There are some repeat characters, but it still doesn’t matter much.  The first game had a pretty convoluted story to begin with and honestly that part has never been one of the primary strengths of these games.  The story of the second game is more straight forward and enjoyable enough, but it’s still nothing special.  

What really makes these games great is the excellent and incredibly deep combat and gameplay.  Also the setting, awesome Japanese style, and mythology.  The games are very similar to one another and honestly 2 feels more like an enormous expansion than anything else.. but that’s surprisingly not even really a knock on it, because they’re just so much fun to play.  

The games borrow liberally from Soulsborne.  I mean, Nioh really has as many soulsborne elements as any soulslike I’ve ever played.  That being said, it doesn’t quite feel like a soulsborne when you’re actually playing it.  It has a loot and progression system much more akin to something like Diablo.  It also has a completely different atmosphere and vibe than the souls games..  it’s absolutely beautiful in its own right, just completely different.  

I’m a diehard souls fan, but I’m also a diehard Nioh fan.. just don’t go into Nioh expecting a souls experience.  I did that at first and didn’t fully enjoy it.  Once I took it for what it was (and took the time to really learn all of its complex systems - which can be daunting at first but is entirely worth the investment) I fell in love with Nioh.  The complexity - and therefore depth - of Nioh is part of what makes it so great.  To answer your question again, yes, you can step right into 2 without having played 1.  It might just seem like a steep learning curve at first, but once it clicks it’s so damn worth it.  

But, I do want to emphasize that the primary issue with starting with the second game is most likely a much more difficult acclimation period.  my advice, right away, is to learn how to ki pulse, burst counter (something that’s not in the first game), and the benefits of magic and ninjitsu."
movies,fqmmg6n,t1_fqm7bvd,1589479882.0,"I definitely agree.  For me at least, a lot of that has to do with just how ridiculously overhyped it was.  The previews made it seem like a nonstop visceral action movie, and I couldn’t get more than two feet without seeing some mention of it being “the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan”.   There isn’t even really a traditional battle sequence between two sides.. and in a way it seems much more about a personal journey than it does an actual war film.  I still think it was good, just not great.  I also think the ending was a bit of a letdown, even though it works quite well with regards to what the film actually is.  I think if I had gone into this movie without the ridiculous hype and the particular mental image that was born from its previews, I would have enjoyed it much, much more.  If I had gone into it not looking for “the best war film since Saving Private Ryan”, but instead just a beautifully shot WWI era action drama with breathtaking cinematography and a story of personal triumph, I would have found the entire experience much more enjoyable.  I need to watch it again once everything has cooled off a bit, but as it stands I was noticeably let down by this film."

PS4Deals,fop3xst,t3_g8i3c7,1587952540.0,"I tried really really hard to like this game but I just didn’t.  BUT, I am certainly not on the opposite side of the spectrum as someone who hates on it.  If it works for you, that’s awesome and I don’t doubt for a second that there is a large portion of the population who will really connect with this game.  

There are certainly parts about it It I REALLY liked.  Noticeably the visuals/aesthetic/vibe, virtually all of the sci fi elements, and for the most part the story.  I think it’s a beautiful game in a lot of ways.  I love really out there sci fi, so that element of this game I was all about.  However.. the core gameplay loop and the combat are two enormous areas that just didn’t do it for me.  And, unfortunately, these really are two enormous areas.  You really are a glorified UPS guy and package delivery is the overwhelming focus of the game.  On top of that, even when there is cool combat moments, actually playing through them is pretty simplistic and uninspired.  Like, The WWI / WWII / Vietnam War sequences are really bad ass.  I wish there were more of them.  But, once again - the combat itself is still pretty average.  

I really do want to like this game.  I’m team Kojima all the way and I’m totally on board with him getting weirder and weirder.  That being said, my favorite parts about this game were the ones that felt like MGS.  The core gameplay just didn’t do it for me and because it was such an important focus of the game, it dragged the entire experience down (for at least me personally).  I’m not entirely upset I played this game as I certainly got something out of it - but, I am poor and I write this just to potentially give some more insight to anyone who’s on the fence."
Colts,foj24ib,t1_fohqpez,1587805340.0,"Best hands in the entire draft, according to PFF..  He dropped 5 total passes in 4 years of college.  He also had 4 different starting QBs."
nyjets,foibrdz,t3_g7knk1,1587783002.0,"I made a summary of PFF’s views on him:

Pros: 

- 27th overall on the PFF big board. (!)

- As elite of an athlete as the position gets in this draft.

- Elite playmaker.  Circus catches on a weekly basis at Baylor.

- Elite catch radius and ball skills.  Jump ball specialist.

- Didn’t face a lot of elite defensive competition, but came to play when he did.

- He earned the highest grade of all WRs during one on ones at the Senior Bowl.

Cons:

- While he has strong hands and can make excellent catches, he struggled with notable drops throughout his career but especially during his final season at Baylor (it is important to note that he has claimed he played all of 2019 with a broken hand).

- Still, over the course of his career he dropped 24 catchable passes out of 210 targets.  This is unacceptable.

- Limited route tree at Baylor.  Lots of fades.  Lots of simple passes that relied on his athleticism to make plays.

- Plays too upright and doesn’t win at a high enough level off the line of scrimmage (even though, once again, he did well at the Senior Bowl).

Bottom line:  While the drops are a legitimate concern, he looked like a completely different player at the Senior Bowl.  He ran a complete route tree, dominated against one on one coverage throughout the week, and had a healthy catch rate.  If anything, the combine and Senior Bowl prove that he is more than physically capable of running every route in the book at a very high level.  

PFF called him (direct quote): “a sure fire first rounder”

One last thing to add, he has a bonafide elite sparq score of 95"

NFL_Draft,fmtjn54,t3_fxbf8d,1586373859.0,"There are only two ways for college games (as far as I’m aware).

1). YouTube or ESPN.  Right off the bat, Youtube has some high quality videos of past games.  ESPN does too, but I don’t think they last long.  There could be another sports service like this that has something, but I’m not sure.  For NFL games, the NFL pass gives you access to an entire archive of past games (but you’d still need a recording and editing software like I mention below).

2) Purchase a service that can stream live TV directly to your computer (like Plex, SlingTv, DirectTv, or even PlayStation Vue) and then use a high fidelity screen recorder (like Movavi) to capture the video and edit it (as well as make it accessible to other editing software).  

2 is the primary way used by Youtubers.  These people are legitimately recording as many live games as they possibly can and creating their own databases to come back to for editing into highlight clips.  You have to be somewhat tech savvy and dedicate some serious resources to this, but it’s what the biggest youtubers use.  Smaller youtubers are probably just stealing off of this and editing their own highlight clips from highlight clips that have already been posted (and other general footage posted to YouTube).  Kind of like using a paragraph from Wikipedia for a school report and just changing around some of the words and sentence structure.  

I guess there could be an option #3 - someone who has inside access to official archival footage from ESPN, the NCAA, and/or team specific sources.  This certainly could be an option, I just don’t know."
PS4Deals,fm8nxf8,t1_fm880eu,1585852807.0,"Personally, I found the story to be just ok and many of the characters to be mind numbingly irritating - more so than any prior title.  Some of the dialogue and writing is absolutely cringeworthy.  The two primary antagonists are also absolutely terrible.  I’m not saying it’s completely without some of the series charm, but it is noticeably lacking.  Some of the writing is just painful.  

HOWEVER, the game is just so much damn fun to play.  The gameplay itself is easily the best the series has ever been.  The weapons and loot system are phenomenal.  The guns look, sound, and feel incredible.  A few of the levels are a bit drab, but most of them are incredible as well.  The graphics and overall art style are probably the best the series has ever been.  Even with a mediocre story and an over abundance of underwhelming (if not straight up annoying) characters, Borderlands 3 is - in my opinion - tied with 2 for the best in the series.  Hell, as far as the moment to moment experience goes, it’s probably *the* best.  

I’m someone who really does like story and characters in games.. so that’s really saying something.  I highly recommended Borderlands 3 to really anyone, but especially if you like loot games, co-op games, and/or other games in this series."

However, if we are talking purely trap games - the Stanford loss was sandwiched between games against unranked Arizona and unranked Washington.  We also lost to Oregon that year and wouldn’t have been in the national title game regardless.

The Oregon State loss, however, was sandwiched between blowout wins against #5 Ohio State and #23 Oregon.  Furthermore, the 2008 team was a much better team than the 2007 one.  And to top it all off, 2008 was our very last window for a championship.  It was one of the very best teams of the Carrol era, and SC went 9-4 the following year.  Sanctions soon followed after that, and the era was pretty emphatically ended once and for all.

I agree with you, though - experiencing the Stanford loss at the time was arguably much worse.  However, if put into perspective, I think it’s safe to say the 2008 loss to Oregon State is about as bad of a trap game USC has seen in its modern era.

Either way, they were both terrible, baffling losses."

Nioh,fibv9pc,t1_fibpv9i,1582330948.0,"Yeah, definitely.  I will say, however, the game is pretty complex.  There’s a lot going on and it can be overwhelming at first.. but, that’s also part of the game’s charm.  Once everything clicks, it just becomes that much more addicting.  The loot, progression, and combat systems are just a blast.  Everything is so finely tuned and well balanced, it’s pretty damn impressive.  

The soulsborne games are still my personal favorite games of all time.  But, Nioh is close.  I just like them for fairly different reasons.  

Here’s just two quick pieces of advice:  Learn to ki pulse as soon as you can.  Once it becomes second nature, you become so much more effective.  Second, there is a multitude of tools and magic at your disposal.  They can be exceptionally powerful.  On my first playthrough I didn’t much pay attention to magic, but, boy was that a mistake.  There are things that can drastically increase your attack or defense, as well as things that can paralyze or slow down your enemies.  One called Sloth makes your targeted opponent significantly slower for a while.  This is super effective against certain bosses.  Also, learn all the types of elemental damage.  Each element can inflict a certain status effect (the lightning status effect makes enemies slower and can stack on top of Sloth - for instance) as well as do more damage in general against enemies who are weak to said element.  

I could go on forever, because like I said, there’s a lot going on.  This game just has a staggering amount of effective tools at your disposal.

Hope you have fun man!"
Nioh,fibhnh0,t1_fibcivx,1582322146.0,"The game doesn’t inherently push towards grinding, although you certainly can (and most people probably need to at some point).  I’d say in general it would be about as much as it would be with the souls games.  I’d say in most of my play throughs I only played each level once (if it hasn’t been mentioned already, Nioh is split into individual levels and is not wide open and interconnected like most of the Souls series - this put me off initially, but eventually it became a non issue).

There are some notable aspects to point out about Nioh in this regard: 

1) You can play any standard or NG cycle that you’ve unlocked at any time.  Meaning, say you’re on NG+4 - you can still go back and play any level on NG or NG++, etc.  All NG cycles are permanently unlocked.  This is helpful because there are two reasons to grind in this game: for materials/money or for leveling up.  If you’re just grinding for materials/money, playing on an easier cycle is nice.  That being said, you really don’t need to grind for those things much at all for the first couple play throughs if you don’t want to.

2) A lot of the game is RNG based like any loot game, HOWEVER the game eventually allows you to use different materials called Umbracite to change stat bonuses on your gear in a very specific manner.  You will still need to hope for rolls that really max out a piece of gear’s absolute potential (especially for later play throughs), but a lot of that RNG can be completely negated by Umbracite.  Some of the absolute best stats for gear can be pretty easily hand picked this way.  This can save a ton of grinding.  

3) Because this game is so well designed with regards to its loot system, a lot of the times the grinding for me didn’t even feel like grinding.  Even if you’re grinding for a specific material or item, everything you get can be useful.  Even all the lower level gear items can be recycled for useful materials.  You can also grind specific bosses for specific things - which are shown to you on the home screen.  

4) This game is certainly difficult, especially at first.  I tried to play this game like Bloodborne initially and got my ass kicked.  This game probably took me longer to acclimate than any game in recent memory.  But, once I did, I really did - and I hit that sweet spot like I had with any souls game in the past.  It just took longer to get there.  Some of the bosses can be reeaaallly punishing.  There’s also a system called ki pulse in which right after spending stamina you can press a button to get some of it back.  I found this really hard to get down correctly.  Once I did, however, I fell in love with the mechanic.  Nioh is tough to master but, the combat as a whole is so expansive and responsive that once you do, you really do.  For me personally, this game was more difficult than Bloodborne or any of the souls games, but not quite as difficult as sekiro.  That could differ from person to person, but while sekiro absolutely demands that you master it’s systems, Nioh does as well - but it also gives you a multitude of different avenues (including grinding) to overcome challenges.  The last thing I’ll say, is that I feel some of the absolute most difficult bosses (in comparison to the level you are when you face them) in Nioh come in the first third of the game.  It really is trial by fire.  Hell, one of - if not the most - difficult levels (especially in terms of environment), is like the second or third mission you’ll play."
Nioh,fib76qg,t3_f7bufd,1582316012.0,"Complete edition is totally worth it.

That being said, just a heads up: While Nioh visibly copies sooo many elements from the Soulsborne games, it surprisingly feels nothing like them.  There are certainly a bunch of games that copy the Soulsborne formula, and I’d say Nioh is near the top of that list.  Yet, somehow, it feels entirely different.  Like, Ashen and Salt & Sanctuary - for instance - are Soulsborne clones that actually feel like them.  Nioh has equal, if not more, of those same elements, yet it is entirely it’s own thing. 

Nioh, at least how it feels, is much more like a third person Diablo.  First of all, it is one of the best loot games I have ever played.  Seriously.  on top of that, it is an absolute master class in end game.  Not only is it a game that demands moment to moment physical skill, it also demands thoughtfully designed min/max builds (especially in later playthroughs).  There is also a materials and crafting system that I really grew to love.  

Yes, the core structural elements of Nioh are ripped right from the Soulsborne catalogue.  It even has some very similar enemies.  However, I first picked up Nioh on a desperate search to scratch that itch that the Soulsborne games had left me with.  And, honestly, it just didn’t do it for me.  It did not scratch that particular itch.  However, when I came back to the game months later without trying to force it to be just like a souls gamel I absolutely fell in love and it has since turned into one of my favorite games of all time.  

Nioh is a min/max Diablo style looter slasher with deep, polished combat (that harkens back to Ninja Theory’s finest) and is replete with beautifully stylized Japanese imagery and mythology - all while being built on top of a core structural outline that has been liberally borrowed from the souls games.   Just don’t try to force it to be a souls game."

He has been absolutely thrown to the wolves as the youngest opening day starting quarterback in NFL history.  He was born in 1997 and is 22 (younger than kyler Murray and joe burrow for starters).  He had PFFs 28th ranked offensive line for the season..  he had no offensive line member who graded out over 66.  In fact, over the last 10 games he had only one lineman who even graded out in the 60s, period.  Three other starters graded out in the mid to low 50s and the last one (rookie Chuma Edoga) finished at 48.  

Not only did this constantly give him little time to throw, it especially decimated the run game.  With really no run game (and in general criminal misuse of Bell - especially in the passing game), Darnold was forced to put the offense on his back.  He did have a surprisingly solid defense most of the time, but still.  The amount that has been put on this kid is insane.

nfl,fdl14q3,t3_elxl42,1578515223.0,"Matt Rhule is an impressive guy.  I would love for him to be the coach of my college team.  If Pete hypothetically just retired, I’d certainly be more than open to his hire in the NFL as well.  However, he only has one year of experience in the NFL as a lower level assistant.  It’s true that the college and pro games are merging in many areas in ways they never have in the past, but there are still differences between the two that will always be present.  It starts entirely with defense because unless you’re Alabama (most years) or another team with a truly elite defense, college defenses will always have weaknesses that can be exploited in ways that just aren’t present in the NFL.  This is precisely why lower level/division schools can compete and even win against teams with blue chip talent.  Spread/hybrid/air raid/option/even say pistol style offenses can be used to overwhelm points in college defenses with confusing routes, trickery, and all around speed.  

But, a lot of that completely flies out the window at the pro level.  Speed still helps, but no one in the pros can get by with speed alone like they can in college.   Just look at Reggie Bush.  Hell, Devin Hester is arguably the fastest gameday player in NFL history and he barely even peaked as a mediocre WR.  At the pro level, assignments are so tight and speed is so universal that instead of a chaotic mess of sloppy play with occasional bursts of athletic or execution dominance that makes up most college games, the Pros have all the kinks worked out schematically and mentally with the roster wide athleticism and strength to match.  The pros are a chess match.  Plenty of phenomenal athletes fail at the professional level because they lack the wherewithal to grasp and digest the pro game.  At the same time, plenty of college players who produced at a high level never even have a chance at the pro game because they simply lack the physical traits.  Scooby Wright at Arizona a few years ago had one of the best statistical seasons in CFB history.. he was drafted in the 6th round (IIRC) and even then that was only because the production was that good.  The pros are made up entirely of blue chip athletic skills and minds capable of handling immensely complex and nuanced playbooks.  The drop off in all around ability from the pro level to the college level is astronomical.  Every change in levels is huge, but none are bigger than this one.  No matter what, because of this, there will always be major differences in the way the game is played between the two.  The gap will never get fully bridged no matter how much the pro game continues to take certain concepts from the college game.  On top of this,  there is also an enormous difference in leading college kids vs full grown men.  Just ask Chip Kelly.  To be able to grasp the pro game at a level necessary for professional success as well as having the charisma and leadership to coach and get the best out of full grown men is an enormously different challenge than it is with college.  It is very true that college coaches coming into the NFL today are significantly better prepared than they ever have been in the past, but there is a reason that there exists an incredibly long list of successful college coaches who failed in the pros.  

Matt rhule has turned around both temple and Baylor to a truly impressive level considering what he had to work with going in.  To me, this shouts tremendous leadership capabilities and is a very good sign.  I’m wary of the purely x’s and o’s innovators who’s leadership skills are more of an unknown.  The x’s and o’s part can eventually be (somewhat at least) figured out.. but, the ability to develop and extract the best out of men is one of - if not the - rarest and most exceptional coaching skills there is.  Pete Carrol is not, nor ever has been, an innovator of playcalling.  His entire success through both college and the pros has been his leadership - his ability to eye coaches and talent who can be tremendously successful with the subsequent ability to fully get the most out of them.  David Shaw at Stanford is the same way.  Just look at lane Kiffin on the flip side.  His offensive mastermind prowess has never - even at all the failures - been in question.  His leadership of men, however, has continued to be one big question mark.  

The bottom line is I think Matt rhule has a ton of potential.  And the positives I’ve heard about him seem to be the right kind for sustained success.  Buuutt, there have been far more “surer” hires from the college ranks that have failed miserably.  To think his success is in any way guaranteed is far from accurate.  A 7 year $60 million contract for a college coach with negligible NFL experience is a huge risk.  However, if I’m Carolina I still think it’s a decent move.  Other than Urban Meyer which would have never happened anyways, this was a medium high risk high reward move to secure a still very solid coaching opportunity.  What other options did they have?  Another patriots coordinator?  Someone Marvin Lewis recommended because apparently someone somewhere is listening to that?  The giants were obviously also in the mix (as well as potentially a lot of college teams - including very good ones).  This is the highest ceiling hire they could have made at this point, and sometimes you have to pay and guarantee extra to entice something like that to a team with 3 losing seasons in 4 years and a 5-11 season this year.  

At the same time, I get why NY didn’t want to match that.  Rhule came out at a very decent time, just like free agent players do sometimes.  There are no real high end hires in the pro ranks and he’s arguably the second best option at the collegiate level.  And the first best option, urban Meyer, still might not even be an option.  If I’m Carolina I would be cautiously optimistic.. but more of the optimistic part.   Guys with track records of turning around fledgling programs and getting double digit win seasons out of them in under a few years are always the kinds of guys you wanna invest in.  Good luck Carolina.  I will continue to enjoy watching a bunch of your players, especially kuechly and mccaffrey.  

Tldr; countless college success stories have flat out failed at the pro level.  Every few years in between another one grabbing our attention, we seem to forget this fact and fall right back into the hype train.  Still, Matt Rhule seems to be exceptionally high character with strong leadership abilities and this makes a 7 year $60 million gamble seem like a risky, aggressive, but worthwhile high ceiling move that fans can and should feel pretty excited about until given a reason otherwise.  The way he’s turned around struggling teams and built them into conference and even national powers is his highest selling point beyond any potential high end and nuanced schematic grasp of NFL level playcalling.  I’m not saying he doesn’t have that, but I am saying the last guy with his resume of going to lowly schools and whipping out ten plus win seasons in no time is John harbaugh (just forget his post nfl big game issue at michigan.. I mean or don’t, because it’s kind of head scratching.  I mean, Alabama I get.  But everything else.. he beat #2 USC with 43 point underdog Stanford and even almost beat a top #5 Oklahoma with backup qb travita Pritchard.   He came to play hard every big game in his career up to and including the 49ers.. now just not Michigan, which is strange enough for me to completely lose my train of thought for.  I totally forget what I was saying, so I’d like to end this discussion with something positive and a little motivational life advice for all of us to sit and ruminate on... boobies.)"

gaming,fc1ba8v,t1_fc0yba5,1577313622.0,"It is an incredibly constructed game on so many levels.  Rockstar’s commitment to quality and detail is (in my opinion) the absolute pinnacle of the industry.   The story is great and the characters are just unbelievably realistic and interesting.  And not just the main ones.. *all of them*.  From homeless war veterans on the street to members of high society, the world Rockstar has created is awe inspiring.  

That being said, there are a few issues I think that may deter some individuals (and they are valid).  

1). This game is, for the most part, slowly paced.  I’m not necessarily talking about the narrative, but more just how your character moves and interacts with the world.  Rockstar has gone for a level of realism beyond what they’ve done in the past, and with that has come some slower paced gameplay.  This might be annoying to some, it was for me at times.

2) in continuation of the last, Rockstar has implemented an extensive amount of mechanics and gameplay elements that really don’t do much beyond small surface level type things.  For instance, your gun can get dirty and all you have to do is open up your menu and use gun oil to clean it.  If you don’t, your gun is just less powerful.. nothing else happens.  You can play the entire game with dirty guns as enemies can be killed with just a few shots anyways.  But the point is that there are a million little mechanics like that that are an attempt at realism.. when in reality they can just bog down gameplay and be annoying.  If you have the mindset of fully immersed role play, however, they can be fun.  I personally experienced both sides of this.  

3) while the guns themselves are awesome (as well as hunting), human enemies can sometimes feel a bit too floaty (for lack of a better word).  Think GTA V... while everything else in this game goes for super realism, the amount and ease of which you kill human enemies is completely over the top.  You aren’t a gunslinger just trying to survive, you are a goddamn killing machine and just like GTA V you can just take out endless waves of enemies.  I personally don’t like this.. In general I found the combat to be waayyy too easy (even with complete free aim).  I’m not saying it’s not fun at times, but just that it’s too absurd and easy.   And there’s no difficulty setting to make it more difficult.  

Personally, I went in waves of not that interested to insanely immersed.  If you find yourself capable of getting 100% immersed in this world, you will be absolutely blown away.  Despite the negatives I’ve listed, the game is still a truly incredible achievement.  It deserves all the praise.. but just be wary that there are some things that certain players will find irritating.

**Tldr;**. The game is amazing but it has certain elements that some players may find cumbersome and irritating."

FragileWhiteRedditor,f7lw0hc,t1_f7l0lew,1573849134.0,"Hey, I agree with you.  I’ll die on the hill of downvotes with you.  I’ve lived in two places: 1) a very rural town of half white and half Hispanic (a fair amount of racism) and 2) just outside a major city with a community filled with people from all walks of life, including Asian, Hispanic, black, and white (much less racism).  

No, the hardcore racists will most likely not change regardless of the exposure they are faced with.  However, plenty of other people who have some racist tendencies - even plenty of which they are completely unaware of themselves - can learn to overcome them through exposure and understanding.  One of the funniest things about the racism I encountered in my small hometown is that a lot of it was directed towards black people - *even though virtually none lived there nor even anywhere close*.  It was a very fundamental racism.  A fundamental fear of “other”.  

To quote Mark Twain:

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.”

Travel in this case basically refers to exposure.  It is not a coincidence that the highest levels of racism come from the areas with the lowest levels of exposure to cultural diversity.  The real hardcore racists are realistically set in their ways for life.  They should be identified and removed from all potentially harmful areas.. but, for everyone else, what we really need is exposure and love."

The characters/story/mystery behind it all are all incredible (once again, in my opinion at least).  The desolate post apocalyptic setting is beautiful.  I think the creatures are really interesting.  It definitely has a Lovecraft meets Annihilation feel to it all.

Buuuut, I’m finding the core gameplay loop of package delivery man simulator to be somewhat engaging, but unspectacular.  Like, I’m enjoying it enough to keep playing the rest of the game - which i really do find haunting, beautiful, and wholly original.  However, if the gameplay wasn’t attached to the rest of the game, I doubt I’d ever touch it.  

Still, I’m a sucker for this kind of sci fi.  As a whole, the game has been really breathtaking in so many ways.  As a piece of art or medium to express a brilliant piece of sci fi, this game has been a knockout.  I just don’t know how I’ll feel about the core gameplay loop in the long run.  I wish combat had more of a center stage and was more fleshed out.  That said, I still do like it.  I just don’t love it.  I think this game could have been one of the absolute greatest games of this generation if it had a fundamentally more engaging gameplay loop.  

But, really it’s still very much worth the price of admission.  It’s the first game I’ve bought for full price in quite a while and overall I am certainly happy with it.  Once again, I am such a sucker for this kind of sci fi.  As a package it is just so bizarre, original, and beautifully crafted that I’m finding enough to fall in love with.

Still, I can certainly understand why some people would not like this game at all.  If you hate this game, you are definitely not wrong.  I am amazed that even someone as influential as Kojimo was able to gain this level of funding for a game with a core gameplay loop that can aptly be described as delivery man simulator.

And it’s not just generals - think of all the genuine lifers working for this country who have to deal with this fucking clown show.  There are intelligent, capable, and hardworking people who have given their lives for this country and government.. only to wind up with the incoherent rambling mess that is this presidency."
CFB,f596qe5,t1_f58xi86,1572073536.0,"We have the best overall group of skill position players we’ve had since the Carrol era.. in my opinion, by a long shot.  The games we’ve won have been despite the coaching - and certainly not because of it.  Helton was the offensive coordinator of central Michigan before we hired him to the same position.  Then, shortly after that, sark’s alcoholism became painfully obvious and he was fired.  So, Clay was thrust into the interim head coaching job.  He was in way over his head, but Darnold came in and pretty much single handedly turned around the team’s momentum for the better part of two seasons.   And, after that, Lynn swan - who himself was comically under qualified as AD - thought, hey, let’s give clay Helton a huge and highly guaranteed contract because obviously that was all just coaching.  But, the truth is clay has been in way over his head the entire time.  He was in over his head as OC.  I feel bad because he’s a nice guy who’s getting constant shit from all angles and you can’t really blame someone for accepting job offers like that.   I know you probably don’t care about any of that, but there it is.  Our talent has remained fairly solid.. but, ever since Carrol we’ve just been slogging through year after year of absolute mediocrity (at best) regarding the coaching staff."
CFB,f595won,t1_f58vx84,1572072386.0,"That’s the saddest thing.. we have some of the best talent we’ve had in quite a while, especially at the skill positions.. better than what Darnold had, that’s for sure.  We even have a semi serviceable line.  Sure, we’ve been decimated by injuries - but it’s all being wasted on an average coach anyways.   I would kill for a coach like James franklin.  I like penn state so I would feel bad about stealing the actual James franklin.. but, I guess I’m just jealous.  It’s been so long since we’ve had a good coach."
