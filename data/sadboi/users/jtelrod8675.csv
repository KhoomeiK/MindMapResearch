tax,fiisu8n,t1_fiiduma,1582426067.0,"Well. It‚Äôs rural West Virginia. The property has a house on it and the folks who had been renting it for decades (no lease), bought a piece of the land that included the house. My mom then sold the remaining almost 12 acres to a neighbor. So we need to locate the value of the two pieces of land total.  I did loos at the GIS date for that county and found the two pieces of property but there is no information further back than 2016. Is there somewhere else that may show the history of sales or transfer of ownership?"
