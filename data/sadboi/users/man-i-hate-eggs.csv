unpopularopinion,fqwptu5,t1_fqvjev0,1589713453.0,"In Islam there isn’t anything as “casual believer” 

Yeah every Muslim do everything they can to get away from haram and do everything god orders us to do 

But humans are not perfect 

In Islam it’s much rewarding to do a mistake and then repent then to not do the mistake at the first place 

When allah (god) made humans the angels asked why did you make imperfect beings while here we do everything you order and pray for you night and day and allah answered “I know what you don’t” 

If allah wanted us to be perfect in every way and not do a single sin he wouldn’t made us in the first place 

Also there’s in Islam things that are haram - which means things you can’t do and you get punished for doing it (like drinking alcohols, doing drugs, premarital sex)

Things that are wajab- which you need to do and get punished for not doing (like praying the wajab , respecting your parents etc) 

Things that are sunnah- which means it’s better to do these things but you don’t get punished if you didn’t do it 

And things that are makroh which means it’s better not to these things but you won’t get punished if you didnt

Also it’s haram to do things that would harm you or you can’t do it 

This is in Quran “On no soul doth Allah Place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns, and it suffers every ill that it earns. (Pray:) ""Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden Like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; Help us against those who stand against faith."""

These views can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities.” So yeah what you’re doing is pretty racist generalization"
