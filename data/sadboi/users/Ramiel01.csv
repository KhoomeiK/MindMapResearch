&#x200B;

It's okay, things aren't as desperate as you might think (I hope). Not a lawyer, but I am a litigious little shit who's been renting all my life.

&#x200B;

Try giving Tenancy WA a call on (08) 9221 0088 to clarify what the standard is for serving a notice to remedy. I suspect that there's probably just a 'best practice' guideline. Did you give your landlord permission to send you electronic notices? If they usually communicate by email then I think they done fucked up.

&#x200B;

If you didn't receive notice to remedy the breach within 14 days, then either it got lost in the mail (possible but vanishingly unlikely), it got mulched on your end by accident, or it was never sent. I'd ask for another copy of the dated remedy notice if I were you. Even if it was sent properly, it will allow you to understand exactly what the breach was for, and if it was serious enough for eviction.

&#x200B;

As for being evicted - a serious breach that isn't remedied allows your agent to give you 7 days notice of eviction. These do have to be serious breaches however, like sub-letting when it's not allowed, nuisance (i.e. getting the cops called at all hours), and 'the carpet was dirty' is **not** one of them. Check out these resources [https://www.tenancywa.org.au/fact-sheets](https://www.tenancywa.org.au/fact-sheets)

&#x200B;

I can tell you from first-hand experience that once the eviction notice is not the same as the plod coming by to throw you out and change the locks at the end of 7 days. You can still *legally* occupy the premises, the lessor has to apply for a termination order which can take a loooong time (abusive neighbours who threatened to kill the owners and more took 2 months to get properly kicked out). Of course continue to pay rent and utilities as normal.

&#x200B;

*Even if* it goes to the courts, if you've since remedied the breach or if the breach wasn't that bad, the magistrate will knock it back to arbitration, I think, not too sure on that.

&#x200B;

Edit: I think this section of the Residential Tenancies Regulation (1989) WA is relevant.

**NOTICES**

...

51C.A notice under this agreement may be given to a person:

51C.1by giving it to the person directly; or

51C.2if an **address for service** for the person is given in the agreement — by posting it to the **address for service**; or

51C.3if  the person has agreed under Part A to the electronic service of  notices — by sending the notice to the email address or facsimile number  given in Part A.

51D.A  person may withdraw his or her consent to a notice being given to the  person by email or facsimile by giving a notice to that effect to each  other party to the agreement.

&#x200B;

Emphasis mine. Is there an address for service described in the lease agreement? If not then I think they'd have to deliver it to you directly."
