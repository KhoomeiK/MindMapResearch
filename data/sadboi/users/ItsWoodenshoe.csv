2. I’m not sure. That’s why I want an appointment with my GP who actually listens to me and talk about my options

3. Mainly that my diagnosis is wrong and I want to remove it from my files. Also my depressed feelings and thoughts is what I wanted to address because I feel like I actually need help with that ASAP... Other than that it was mainly stuff about my private situation (not being or feeling supported by family, can’t talk to anyone else other than my GP and psychologist)

4. Idk lol"
