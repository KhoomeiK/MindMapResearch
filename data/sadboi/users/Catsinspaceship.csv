Radish Kimchi
4 pounds of radish cubed
6 cloves Garlic smushed
6 Green onion chopped
Just a lil sliced Ginger , like a two-three inch chunk
2/3 cup pepper flakes
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tbsp salt
2 tbsp sugar

Mix in a bowl, move to a jar and smash it down to squeeze all air pockets out. leave out for at least two days (make sure to use an air lock or some sort of cloth over the top), store in refrigerator when kimchi has achieved desired funk."

AskVet,fnuhhv1,t1_fnu5jgu,1587262212.0,"I think it’s an organism thing to be attached to your own reproductive organs, not just humans. 
It’s kind of fucking insane and misandrist to say that only human males (you did specifically mention testicles) have a strong desire to mate, when the literal purpose of existence is to continue that existence by reproducing. 
It’s not projection, it’s empathy. 

Now, the reason I’ll be neutering my dog is because 1. Those fit in other dogs mouths, and can make a fun day at the park a life scarring event. 
2. It’s a heavy burden to need to fuck and not be able to. If priests can’t handle it, there’s no way my border collie will be able to. 
So, no testicles = no desire to mate, and if he does and tries to, no one has to worry. 
3. There are restrictions where I live that will only allow your dog at some dog parks, day cares, and even bars if they’re spayed or neutered. I wouldn’t want to keep my boy from fucking AND playing with other dogs. 

Is neutering and spaying abusive? 
Not if you’re doing it for the benefit of the animal, and not yourself. 
Is the reasoning for not wanting to have your pet spayed or neutered because some people are fucked up psychologically? No.

Also, the argument in favor of spaying and neutering just because it prevents cancer is bullshit. Of course it does, you’re removing entire organs. It’s the same reason some women get a mastectomy. But trying to convince someone to spay/neuter by saying “oh it’ll reduce your pets risk of cancer” is manipulative. It’s common sense stated in a way that glazes over the fact that something will kill your pet no matter what, and implies that ball cancer is certainly going to happen to your dog, and will surely significantly reduce his lifespan."

I love the bus, and I love the rail.
I don’t love it taking an hour getting somewhere I could get in ten minutes by car. 
Or waiting because the train only comes once every 45 minutes (if it’s even running at all, like at night), packing myself into the railcar and having to stand the whole way there and back, and only being able to travel down that single line. Bringing a bike helps, but there’s never anywhere to hang it. 
The bike lanes are terrifying and I feel like any day now I’m going to get plowed by a car. It’s a very real possibility.

I totally agree with you. I use not a car as often as I can, within reason, because it’s insane/unnecessary to be using an entire pickup truck to get just myself anywhere and everywhere I need to go all the time. But its usually wildly inconvenient to not just drive. 

Cars are allowed to go way too fast, and stuff is way too far apart and spread out, because we don’t have an environment conducive to small businesses existing.

Exercises that are great for starting out are calisthenics (body weight exercises like pushups, pull-ups, and sit-ups), running (slow long distance runs, fast short distance runs, and short sprints all exercise your body differently and are all important). It doesn’t need to be complicated. Some days I literally just do a circuit of pushups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and run.

Again, I’m two weeks in so take everything I have to say with the consideration that I’m totally talking out of my ass. 

I’m assuming the doctor set the settings for you.
Do you know what pressure it’s set to?
On mine (I can’t remember what it’s called and I’m not home so I can’t check) it has a menu for the doc to use so they can adjust your settings and stuff, but I’m dumb and poor so I set my own settings and do the trial and error thing until I figure it out and sleep well. 

I’ve been using the face piece that only goes over your nose, but I’m not a big fan. Mainly because of the way it sits around areas like the bridge of my nose. I already have issues with sinus pressure, and having something else squeezing my nose is extra funky. 

Also, you can do this thing where you control the flow of air (and water, if you’re into that kind of thing) between the back of your throat and your sinuses. So last night I cranked the pressure up pretty high. My allergies were pretty bad and I figured “let’s see what this does... why not?” 
Well I found out why not when at some point during the night I awoke to the sensation of air freely flowing in my nose and out my mouth, completely drying out my sinuses, throat, and mouth. 
I’m guessing due to the high pressure, when my throat relaxed, and I’m assuming my mouth opened, the air pressure overcame whatever throat stuff keeps everything going the way it’s supposed to and continuously force air out my mouth. 
Like I said, dumb and poor, but now I know, so... trial and error until I get it right. 

So should you switch? 
If you’re not comfortable with the mask you’re using, I’d consider at least trying out something else. 
My father in law loves the nose one. It’s all up to what you’re most comfortable with.

ABoringDystopia,fm300in,t1_fm2pnd3,1585709464.0,"Those are interesting points, and while I’m not sure whether I agree or disagree, I certainly have something to think about. I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about this.

Edit:

I got some sleep and put some more thought into what we’ve been talking about. 
I’ve come to the conclusion that you’re right. 
There’s still an insane amount of racism in this country, and it’s a problem that needs to be fixed. 
What I mean when I say “the black lives matter movement is ineffective” is that it doesn’t change the perspective of racists, it just continues to assert a fact. 
It’s not exclusionary, but it’s not making white people any less racist. 
But I do think the movement is unfortunately necessary. 

Again, I appreciate you taking the time to have this conversation with me. It’s always nice having someone calmly explain their perspective instead of just shooting out catchy one liners."
ABoringDystopia,fm2o7x3,t1_fm1ycbx,1585701630.0,"It does, but I disagree. 
The issue is that innocent people are being murdered, and little is being done to keep the people who are supposed to ensure our safety accountable. 

“Black lives matter” is exclusionary, or at least it feels that way to a lot of people. 
So it’s not people vs bad cops and policies, it’s black versus white, which isn’t a battle that can be won by anyone. 

You may be right, but just being right doesn’t change minds, and the black lives matter movement lacks tact and is ineffective."
ABoringDystopia,fm0xs2e,t1_fm0mmsf,1585668253.0,"Fun fact: a welfare check is just checking on someone to see if they’re alright. It has nothing to do with the government assistance program you mentioned.

Edit: sorry I don’t know every Tupac lyric by heart, you douchebags.

Also, the quote still doesn’t seem relevant considering a welfare check has nothing to do with some on welfare.

While I’m here pissing everyone off...
let’s all stop making this about race. 
It doesn’t matter that any of these innocent people who are being killed by cops are black. They’re people. Their race shouldn’t be relevant because race doesn’t matter. We’re all equal, right? Black people are just people like the rest of us, right?
The specification segregates."

SleepApnea,fltxlqb,t3_fr08ho,1585490238.0,"92% blood oxygen is very low, even for someone with severe medical issues. 

Generally, healthy people should be somewhere in the range of about 98% and not below ~ 95% breathing normally. 

So if your O2 monitor is saying your levels are at 92% when you first put it on and go to bed, when you know you’re breathing normally, it’s a safe bet that it’s not reading correctly.

Sleep apnea has many variables and I would highly recommend being re-evaluated by a professional. It’s complicated and difficult to diagnose and treat without professional guidance."

ADHD,fliyv7b,t3_fothj9,1585194163.0,"Learn how to enjoy vegetables*

My fiancé never liked broccoli until I cooked it for her. 
Her mom had always boiled it to mush, and the texture had always been off putting for her.
One night I made it with more.... texture, as well as flavor with the added spices. 
Now she asks for broccoli all the time. 

I used to hate kale until I gave it another go. 
It helps to understand how much heat a veggie needs, what kind of spices to add, and what pairs well with them. 

They’re also unsurprisingly good at combatting daily explosive diarrhea and constipation. 

Eat your veggies, love your veggies. 
Your veggies love you."
