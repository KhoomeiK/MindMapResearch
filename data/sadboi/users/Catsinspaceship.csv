Radish Kimchi
4 pounds of radish cubed
6 cloves Garlic smushed

2/3 cup pepper flakes
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tbsp salt
2 tbsp sugar

It‚Äôs kind of fucking insane and misandrist to say that only human males (you did specifically mention testicles) have a strong desire to mate, when the literal purpose of existence is to continue that existence by reproducing. 
It‚Äôs not projection, it‚Äôs empathy. 

Now, the reason I‚Äôll be neutering my dog is because 1. Those fit in other dogs mouths, and can make a fun day at the park a life scarring event. 
2. It‚Äôs a heavy burden to need to fuck and not be able to. If priests can‚Äôt handle it, there‚Äôs no way my border collie will be able to. 
So, no testicles = no desire to mate, and if he does and tries to, no one has to worry. 
3. There are restrictions where I live that will only allow your dog at some dog parks, day cares, and even bars if they‚Äôre spayed or neutered. I wouldn‚Äôt want to keep my boy from fucking AND playing with other dogs. 

Is neutering and spaying abusive? 
Not if you‚Äôre doing it for the benefit of the animal, and not yourself. 
Is the reasoning for not wanting to have your pet spayed or neutered because some people are fucked up psychologically? No.

Also, the argument in favor of spaying and neutering just because it prevents cancer is bullshit. Of course it does, you‚Äôre removing entire organs. It‚Äôs the same reason some women get a mastectomy. But trying to convince someone to spay/neuter by saying ‚Äúoh it‚Äôll reduce your pets risk of cancer‚Äù is manipulative. It‚Äôs common sense stated in a way that glazes over the fact that something will kill your pet no matter what, and implies that ball cancer is certainly going to happen to your dog, and will surely significantly reduce his lifespan."

I love the bus, and I love the rail.
I don‚Äôt love it taking an hour getting somewhere I could get in ten minutes by car. 
Or waiting because the train only comes once every 45 minutes (if it‚Äôs even running at all, like at night), packing myself into the railcar and having to stand the whole way there and back, and only being able to travel down that single line. Bringing a bike helps, but there‚Äôs never anywhere to hang it. 
The bike lanes are terrifying and I feel like any day now I‚Äôm going to get plowed by a car. It‚Äôs a very real possibility.

I totally agree with you. I use not a car as often as I can, within reason, because it‚Äôs insane/unnecessary to be using an entire pickup truck to get just myself anywhere and everywhere I need to go all the time. But its usually wildly inconvenient to not just drive. 

Cars are allowed to go way too fast, and stuff is way too far apart and spread out, because we don‚Äôt have an environment conducive to small businesses existing. 

I would be so happy if I could walk most places most of the time. I‚Äôve done it. I prefer it. But that wasn‚Äôt in Texas, and we don‚Äôt have enough people here that give a shit about that sort of thing to make it happen any time soon."

Again, I‚Äôm two weeks in so take everything I have to say with the consideration that I‚Äôm totally talking out of my ass. 

I‚Äôm assuming the doctor set the settings for you.
Do you know what pressure it‚Äôs set to?
On mine (I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called and I‚Äôm not home so I can‚Äôt check) it has a menu for the doc to use so they can adjust your settings and stuff, but I‚Äôm dumb and poor so I set my own settings and do the trial and error thing until I figure it out and sleep well. 

I‚Äôve been using the face piece that only goes over your nose, but I‚Äôm not a big fan. Mainly because of the way it sits around areas like the bridge of my nose. I already have issues with sinus pressure, and having something else squeezing my nose is extra funky. 

Also, you can do this thing where you control the flow of air (and water, if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing) between the back of your throat and your sinuses. So last night I cranked the pressure up pretty high. My allergies were pretty bad and I figured ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what this does... why not?‚Äù 
Well I found out why not when at some point during the night I awoke to the sensation of air freely flowing in my nose and out my mouth, completely drying out my sinuses, throat, and mouth. 
I‚Äôm guessing due to the high pressure, when my throat relaxed, and I‚Äôm assuming my mouth opened, the air pressure overcame whatever throat stuff keeps everything going the way it‚Äôs supposed to and continuously force air out my mouth. 
Like I said, dumb and poor, but now I know, so... trial and error until I get it right. 

So should you switch?

A home, sheetrocked, with thicker/better lumber in the walls, will not burn just as quick as this did. 

Homes a hundred years ago burned slower than they do now. That is a fact. The reason for this is construction techniques and materials have changed."

ABoringDystopia,fm300in,t1_fm2pnd3,1585709464.0,"Those are interesting points, and while I‚Äôm not sure whether I agree or disagree, I certainly have something to think about. I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about this.

Edit:

I got some sleep and put some more thought into what we‚Äôve been talking about. 
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that you‚Äôre right. 
There‚Äôs still an insane amount of racism in this country, and it‚Äôs a problem that needs to be fixed. 
What I mean when I say ‚Äúthe black lives matter movement is ineffective‚Äù is that it doesn‚Äôt change the perspective of racists, it just continues to assert a fact. 
It‚Äôs not exclusionary, but it‚Äôs not making white people any less racist. 
But I do think the movement is unfortunately necessary. 

Again, I appreciate you taking the time to have this conversation with me. It‚Äôs always nice having someone calmly explain their perspective instead of just shooting out catchy one liners."
ABoringDystopia,fm2o7x3,t1_fm1ycbx,1585701630.0,"It does, but I disagree. 
The issue is that innocent people are being murdered, and little is being done to keep the people who are supposed to ensure our safety accountable. 

‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù is exclusionary, or at least it feels that way to a lot of people. 
So it‚Äôs not people vs bad cops and policies, it‚Äôs black versus white, which isn‚Äôt a battle that can be won by anyone. 

You may be right, but just being right doesn‚Äôt change minds, and the black lives matter movement lacks tact and is ineffective."
ABoringDystopia,fm0xs2e,t1_fm0mmsf,1585668253.0,"Fun fact: a welfare check is just checking on someone to see if they‚Äôre alright. It has nothing to do with the government assistance program you mentioned.

Edit: sorry I don‚Äôt know every Tupac lyric by heart, you douchebags.

Also, the quote still doesn‚Äôt seem relevant considering a welfare check has nothing to do with some on welfare.

While I‚Äôm here pissing everyone off...
let‚Äôs all stop making this about race. 
It doesn‚Äôt matter that any of these innocent people who are being killed by cops are black. They‚Äôre people. Their race shouldn‚Äôt be relevant because race doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre all equal, right? Black people are just people like the rest of us, right?
The specification segregates."

SleepApnea,fltxlqb,t3_fr08ho,1585490238.0,"92% blood oxygen is very low, even for someone with severe medical issues. 

Generally, healthy people should be somewhere in the range of about 98% and not below ~ 95% breathing normally. 

So if your O2 monitor is saying your levels are at 92% when you first put it on and go to bed, when you know you‚Äôre breathing normally, it‚Äôs a safe bet that it‚Äôs not reading correctly.

Sleep apnea has many variables and I would highly recommend being re-evaluated by a professional. It‚Äôs complicated and difficult to diagnose and treat without professional guidance."

ADHD,fliyv7b,t3_fothj9,1585194163.0,"Learn how to enjoy vegetables*

My fianc√© never liked broccoli until I cooked it for her. 
Her mom had always boiled it to mush, and the texture had always been off putting for her.
One night I made it with more.... texture, as well as flavor with the added spices. 
Now she asks for broccoli all the time. 

I used to hate kale until I gave it another go. 
It helps to understand how much heat a veggie needs, what kind of spices to add, and what pairs well with them. 

They‚Äôre also unsurprisingly good at combatting daily explosive diarrhea and constipation. 

Eat your veggies, love your veggies. 
Your veggies love you."
