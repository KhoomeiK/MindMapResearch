I have many weakness, almost all of which are my husband's strengths. I struggle with understanding straightforward concepts, thinking logically in emotional situations, focussing on one topic at a time, staying level headed ... There are so many. Many of my successes are due to his help."
aspergers,fi29e2f,t3_f5yqu3,1582074518.0,"Update: after discussing many of the suggestions with my husband, he mentioned that scheduling, stating intent, and writing things down would help him tremendously. When I speak emotionally he described processing each word as it is defined in the dictionary. I believe this is why conversations sometimes end in frustration. I would like to thank this community for helping me better understand how to bridge the gap in communication. I have a greater appreciation for how he must feel. Thank you.

If there was a magic pill that would erase my bipolar disorder, I would decline it. Most days I'm really stable with the help of medication, regular psychiatry visits, having and building a support system and acknowledging my limits. I've been extraordinarily fortunate to have incredible friends, a spouse whose strengths are my weaknesses and vice versa, and loving family. I've also put in an exceptional amount of work and I never gave up trying to improve myself even at my lowest. It took time but well worth it. (34 years old, diagnosed early, Bipolar II)"

It's an inconvenience and a devastating one at times but it's also a part of who I am. Because we deal with constant self monitoring, analyzing the world around us and finding ways to cope with life, we develop an incredible amount of empathy. It's because we keep enduring that we have the capacity to understand what it means to be different and help others struggling with their own demons. Adversity has a tendency to shape us.

bipolar,er1ewgx,t3_c01emx,1560430871.0,"I would like to echo peoples concerns about your doctor. You can live a wonderful life while being bipolar. You have to work at it but it's completely possible. You can finish school, have a career, a relationship etc..  The whole bipolar narrative needs to change. We have so much to offer and it shows ignorance on behalf on any provider who uses ""the jail card"" as a diagnostic tool. Honestly, I can't wait to hear about all the awesome things you will accomplish. Keep this channel in mind and if you ever need a pick-me-up you know where to find us.

Edit: (personal) I started therapy before the age of 12. Struggled through my teens and early 20's. With time, support, medication and a strong will to improve I learned how to healthily manage my BP. It gets easier. It gets much easier. I'm now in my 30's. I still see a psychiatrist and take medication but I have a wonderful life. Happily married for 8 years, college educated, sweet career etc..
