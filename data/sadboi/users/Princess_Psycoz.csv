Dude you need to chill, I don't agree with what OP is doing. But from the Patient Privacy side, it sounds like hes in the clear. I dont know if their country/city/state/county has laws against showing medical procedures in public, I don't know if theres company rules from the train company about it. But this OG commenter asked about patient privacy laws and I explained that it's legal from that side of things as long as the patient is unidentifiable and if it's on YT it probably clears HIPAA or other PPLs."
AmItheAsshole,fgb0yo2,t1_fgazmtw,1580657447.0,"No because theyd be identifiable so couldn't be watched/recorded in the first place.

In the case of the US, HIPAA covers something called PHI. 

""Individually identifiable health information includes 18 identifiers: 1) names; 2) all geographical subdivisions smaller than a state (including street address, city, county, precinct, and zip code); 3) all elements (except year) of dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death, and all elements of dates indicative of age; 4) phone numbers; 5) fax numbers; 6) email addresses; 7) Social Security numbers; 8) medical record numbers; 9) health plan beneficiary numbers; 10) account numbers; 11) certificate/license numbers; 12) vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers; 13) device identifiers and serial numbers; 14) Web universal resource locators (commonly referred to as URLs); 15) Internet protocol (or IP) address numbers; 16) biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints; 17) full-face photographic images (and any comparable images); and 18) any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code. ""

As long as all 18 PHI identifiers have been obscured, or are not visible at all and patient consent has been obtained. Its completely legal to watch anywhere. As stated elsewhere in the thread, he was watching this on YT. So chances are, consent was obtained. 

Most PPLs have clauses for media and education purposes, so does HIPAA. Heres a simple explanation.

https://www.todayswoundclinic.com/blog/hipaa-privacy-security-compliance-managing-use-photographs-and-videos-wound-clinic

I work for a hospital. We take classes and refreshes 4 times a year on HIPAA. The big take away, as long as the patient is completely unidentifiable and we've obtained consent, we can record and take photos of our patients for outside hospital use. Again, I work in the US so my knowledge is only as far as HIPAA. 

Doesnt make OP N,TA though. Hes definitely YTA because you just dont watch that shit in public."
AmItheAsshole,fgaygwa,t1_fgaxytx,1580656715.0,"Good point. But most patient privacy laws have that in place due to educational purposes. Videos can be taken as long as the patient is unidentifiable so people can watch them for educational purposes. Otherwise that birthing video you watched in high school (at least in the US we do this) would be illegal. While it's not an educational setting in this case, he is learning about a surgery out of his specialty and is educational for him."
