When you ""empty the recycle bin"", The file-location index ""forgets"" where that file is, and the storage space where that file is is now free to be overwritten with new information.  
  
Since the file is still there, it can be recovered by using recovery software. Generally the first character in the filename is changed to a character the system chooses to ignore and the file can't be ""seen."" But the recovery software can see the file, rename it, and allow it to be copied over to some other storage space.  
  
The only time a file truly goes away is if its file-space is over-written by a new file, or the file is obliterated through the use of file-shredding software. Shredded files bypass the recycle bin and are just replaced with meaningless, random data. There is pretty-much no way to recover a file after that."

And that's a perfect example of what I mean. I don't know of a solution. My way has just been to cut toxic people out of my life. However, I'm high up on the spectrum somewhere, so that's easy for me. One of the weirdest things is that my daughter likes hanging out with me. I am completely clueless about what that feels like. My parents murdered my natural childlike desire to love them early on. I eventually resented my parents so much that I can't understand how my daughter can like her parent. But she does, and I just have to accept that that's reality. Once you're away from your mom, things will change. For example, once I was away, I stopped biting my nails, and I stopped sleeping with a knife under my pillow. I'm ten years behind everyone else in maturity because I had to spend so much time in recovery. I think people who were treated badly pass the bad treatment on because that's what they unconsciously learned from their parents. Once you're away, you'll be conscious, so maybe you won't pass that on. Things will get better, since you're aware. Please don't let it tear you down. It's her problem not yours.

Since the guy was older, and he could manipulate her, he told her that everything I told her was wrong, and that he was right. In order to gain an identity other than what I had established with her, she rebelled. That's exactly what should happen so that she could become a person of her own. I just wish it hadn't happened that way, with that guy. Like I said, giving up that control was hard. But I trusted her, and I knew she would eventually come around, and she did. While they were homeless on the road, driving the car I gave her, she had many adventures and I'm glad she had them. I did the same thing when I was younger, and I certainly didn't hold that against her. The guy's behavior was exactly that of an abusive person: manipulate and isolate, which is just what he did. She had to learn. I couldn't teach her that. Now I'm not in control, we're equals and best friends. The seven years was tough, but it had to happen. Long-term trust was what saved everything. If we hadn't had the foundation we had, things might have not turned around. And I'm not bragging about ""my parenting"". I mean the guy asked. I didn't volunteer this info.

I'm introverted, so I made sure that she was able to do all of the things that I have anxiety about. Her mother was way extroverted though, and she inherited that, thank goodness, so none of that was a problem for her. I also made sure that she knew that she could do whatever she wanted and be whoever she wanted to be as long as she was a good person and didn't knowingly hurt anyone or anything. She had a really broad framework within which to operate. There were only two major issues: I had a girlfriend who was a diabolical psychotic bitch, and she set my daughter up many times by setting impossible standards and forced my daughter into isolation. That was bad. But after I broke up with the psycho, my daughter and I got along again. The other issue was that she hooked up with a toxic guy about twice her age who took her on the road. I had a really tough time giving up control with all that. The dude she was with caused so much trouble that she and I barely communicated for seven years. However, she eventually grew up enough to see through this guy and she finally threw him out. Two years after that he died. For her sake I didn't do The Dance of Joy, but I really wanted to. In the meantime her mother had passed away, so I was her last parent left. She made an effort to resurrect our relationship and now it has never been better. She and I talk so straightforward it makes other people uncomfortable sometimes. So, like in the start of this post, it all just really boils down to telling the truth so that trust is established and that she knows she can talk to me about anything, and to teach her to not be afraid. She's a business woman now and has two businesses. She's got way more going than I ever did at her age. I did make a few mistakes raising her, since I was winging it the whole time, but not too many.  Anyway, that's the gist of it. Hope I wasn't too rambling.  
  
Edit: The worst thing parents can do other than literally being abusive is always shooting their kid's ideas and activities down and always pointing the negatives in situations. I have seen three different dads who acted that way with their sons, and all three sons ended up on hard drugs and in prison. It's like a pattern. The dad's think they're helping their kids see straight, but all they're doing is destroying their kid's joy of living. It's really sad, and to this day, none of those three dads understand me when I bring this up to them. They just think their kids are fucked up but that it's not their (the dad's) fault."
