Both of these are trying to rewire your brain, which is what talk therapy etc are also trying to do but sometimes you get stuck. There is also the risk of worsening depression so please seek guidance.

Another prescription drug to try is antipsychotics. They are used in higher doses to treat psychotic disorders but in lower doses have shown to help depression and anxiety."

I'm sorry you are hurting so much. I think this is definitely enough reason to reach out for help. I tried to find the equivalent in Australia for what I have in my city, an emergency mental health assessment, and came up with this:

https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/crisis-management

There are phone numbers by state listed lower down. 

From the site:

What does a CATT do?

A CATT responds to urgent requests to help people in mental health crisis 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A mental health crisis can include:

a psychotic episode

self-harm

feeling suicidal and

feeling out of control

Sorry I'm on phone and don't know how to format. I visited mine a couple weeks ago and just knowing I'm not alone helps a lot. They took my info and vitals, asked me about my history, and then I waited until someone could speak to me. I spoke to a kind mental health nurse. They made sure I was on medications. I went home that night because I wasn't in danger to myself but they followed up with me a bit.

I hope this helps, please call.


Take care"
