Another reason I never realised the hypomanias for what they were was because of how rare and short lived they are compared to the depression. The name ""Bipolar"" gives false impression of equal time depressed and manic. So despite the excesses I just thought I had got carried away now I was no longer depressed. Over time as well I tended to forget just how over confident etc I was and instead just remembered finally being productive again and managing to do tasks without it being a constant struggle.

bipolar2,fhgx72d,t3_f36xb5,1581583242.0,"I never feel ""normal"". That prevented me seeing the hypomanias for what they were for years - it's was hard to realise the only times I didn't feel ill were also part of the same illness. My ""normal"" is a mild depression. Over time it's improved but it's definitely still on depressed side of normal. That is incredibly common - even the research on euthymia (medical term for periods when not symptomatic) is defined as a score of 8 or less on the bipolar depression scale. On that scale you could have little interest in daily activities, occasionally suicidal, and be a little anxious everyday and not be over 8 points! Thankfully issues of residual depression between episodes is now receiving more attention by clinicians and academics but its still often left out of the textbooks and rarely mentioned on websites explaining bipolar.

I had a similar issue when I finally approached a psychiatrist about potential bipolar. Despite me having none of the key criteria she thought I might instead have BPD or C-PTSD as she said you'd expect periods of normal mood in bipolar. Sadly most clinicians unless they specialise in bipolar only have a teaching model understanding. I took a journal article (I work at a university so got free access to most journals) to my second meeting that reviewed evidence of how to distinguish BPD and bipolar that confirmed a lot of what I said. Even the intro noted that persistent low-level depression between episodes can complicate an accurate bipolar diagnosis."
BipolarReddit,fhgw6b5,t3_f2rjc2,1581581847.0,"I not asexual but damn close and similarly don't get hypersexual - if anything I become more asexual as I become so goal-orientated. 

I think an issue with the DSM list of symptoms is that there are just short descriptors that don't cover the full range of how each symptom presents. I get racing thoughts - but only in mixed states. In euphoric hypomania my thoughts don't race - instead I always spoke about how my ""mind glows"". I am overwhelmed with ideas, it almost feels like I'm being showered in ideas, it's insanely pleasurable to let ideas play out in my mind as if they have a life of their own, and it's like constant jigsaws falling into place. Now that would count as racing thoughts / flight of ideas, and I can see it now having read the diversity of how it presents, but seeing the symptom listed on its own never resonated with my experiences previously.

Similarly I don't get ""rapid speech"". I'm Scottish, we all already speak faster than most other English speakers. What I notice more is in the peaks of hypomania is that I can't stop talking once I start. I've even found myself apologising for not being able to stop talking - but that extreme is rare. More often I become aware of it then focus on keeping my mouth shut and giving only short replies.

Also whilst it's always mentioned you only need X of the symptoms listed below I think most folk end up focusing on all the symptoms in the list they don't have - rather than the ones they do. Also most folk have a false awareness of bipolar from popular culture that is an exaggeration of one way some folk present but many others don't. So they unintentional instinctively see the symptoms through those depictions that again can make it harder to connect them with their own experiences. It's another reason why I think websites need to supplement the DSM lists with short accounts of the diversity of how folk experience them."
bipolar,fhgt0ro,t3_f2x2cn,1581577910.0,"Before I knew I was bipolar I always referred to my ""energy states"" - now I call them ""mood states"". To me it was always clear that these weren't context-related responses but changes in my being-in-the-world. They act as a prism that changes how I perceive and respond to the world. 

Sadly I wish more doctors and psychiatrists were aware of this! A few times before I knew it was bipolar when talking of my ""weird depression"" I was asked what my ""triggers"" were and I replied ""time and stress"" to be treated like I wasn't trying hard enough. Then if something did get to me they acted like it was a gotcha - ""I thought you didn't have triggers!"". I'd then have to explain for the 100th time I didn't say I didn't have triggers, I clearly said time and stress, and depending on energy state I could respond completely different to events. The exact same thing which in severe depression that could derail my day would be like water off a ducks back if I had only mild depression.

Similarly, during what I now know were mixed states I was treated as if the issue was I was merely not practicing CBT hard enough. So many times I reported that when in midst of an episode I could slow the thoughts if focused solely on slowing thoughts but it took intense effort and would only last 1 min at a time before they'd race off again - or as soon as I started doing anything else. Rather than viewing that as potential bipolar I'd be told to keep practicing the CBT."

There use to be a lot of debate on whether BPD was just extremely rapid cycling bipolar. I see a lot of folk with BPD also explain it as ""like bipolar"" likely due to the massive stigma that comes with a personality disorder. However, the scientific consensus is that there are significant number of distinguishing symptoms, in particular BPD responding to interpersonal events and BP being stress and time (the stress from interpersonal events is reason many get misdiagnosed), mean they are seperate conditions rather than part of same spectrum.

I realise the article posted has some sentences on the latter but, in my opinion, it's not explicit enough where I can see plenty of Gwyneth Paltrow types posting blog post takes re nutrition curing their mental health problems.

The language of ""mental wellbeing"" and ""we all have mental health"" erases the fact ""we don't all have mental illness"". Nutrition can definitely effect future mental health in babies and children. It can also cure some mental difficulties neurotypicals may experience due to poor diet. For those with severe mental illness though it can help ease the worst of it but it is by no means at all anything close to a cure. 

I try to eat well, maintain sleep schedule, exercise daily, etc and all these help but they don't cure - and for me the danger of all the focus on mental wellbeing and healthy living is it continuously risks giving the impression it is a cure. It also often ignores how difficult these things can be for folk in the midst of an accute crisis - and the ""have a run and warm bath"" mantra of so many who promote mental wellbeing, whilst well meaning, too often contributes to self-blame for things that can't be controlled by healthy living alone."

It was only reading Jim Phelps books after an incredibly intense 2 week hypomania that everything finally clicked.

bipolar2,fgve04w,t3_f0lssf,1581146269.0,"I was a rapid cycler, thankfully for a lot of folk rapid cycling is a temporary experience though can last 1-5 years or longer. Fatigue has always been the worst symptom for me and was overwhelming during my time rapid cycling. I tried so many things to fight it but would often wake up 4-8 hours after the time I set my alarm to find my phone on the floor with the battery removed with no memory of doing it. Or I'd get up and almost immediately fall asleep if I sat down. When I was at work or social events I use through my pocket dig a sharp key into my leg to try and maintain consciousness. I thankfully don't need to do that anymore.

As I was repeatedly let down by mental health professionals I was left to find my own solutions without medication - so what I'm about to say may seem extreme. I constructed my ""insane alarm clock system"" which at its most extreme consisted of - maths alarm on phone, phone in locked bag, key for alarm in garage, exercise gear set out next to bed, radio alarm in kitchen, coffee machine with timer so 1-2 cups of coffee ready by time I wake up, SAD light to stand next to when eating breakfast. So to turn off my alarms I had to get out of bed, dress in exercise gear, go out into the cold air, answer 10 hard maths questions, and go through to kitchen to turn off radio alarm. By that time I often gained enough consciousness to know I should drink the coffee than go back to bed. At various times I also had people (family member or girlfriend) phone 10 min after I set my alarms to ensure I was awake. If the tiredness won't pass - and for a long long time it won't - I'd turn on the cold tap and place my head under it. If I couldnt muster the energy to go for a run I'd at least go for a 5-10 minute walk. When fatigue is at its worst no sitting is allowed for first 1-2 hours on wakening. 

Even with all that I repeatedly fell asleep during the day, or would pass out on buses and trains to work - or be so tired I couldn't function. Over time I learnt not to admonish myself for these small setbacks - getting angry at myself just made the fatigue worse and contribute to sense of helplessness - but to accept there will be times where the fatigue gets worse and it will win. The aim isn't to win everyday but to win majority of a couple days, a few days, a week, etc so eventually more days are won than lost to fatigue.

I won't lie though, so many times when a severe depression hit and the fatigue was overwhelmingly for weeks, if not months, at a time I gave up. I didn't know I had bipolar and had no idea why these depressions kept hitting. Again over time I slowly learnt to accept these periods will happen and I needed to not expect as much from myself during these periods. Maintain a minimum (at least exercise for 5 minutes in the evening if can't manage 30 in morning) and rebuild rest of routine as and when I could. It never ended the severe depressions but it lessened the burden and less days were a complete loss. It's strange since realising I had bipolar 6 months ago things have been easier - I now know why despite all my efforts why the severe depressions always returned and that things are not wholly within my control. It's made the ""accept not admonish"" mindset easier - and the less anger, frustration, and hopelessness the easier it is to squeeze out at least one thing each day and stop the negative spiral. 

Over time I added additional wee elements such as 30-45 min walk every lunchtime, wee routines for when I get home from work (again often including a no sitting rule when things were at their worst) and to prepare everything for next day. I have alarms on my FitBit for waking up, time to leave for work, lunchtime, home time, time to prep tomorrow, and time to go to sleep.

Nowadays I dont need all the alarms but I maintain the FitBit ones, a minimal insane alarm clock system, daily exercise, and lunchtime walk as there remain days where the fatigue is overwhelming and given I can't predict when it'll hit I live in preparation for it so when it hits it doesn't spiral out of control."
bipolar2,fgvc78v,t3_f0jk5l,1581144178.0,"Until recently I never truly realised what my hypomanias were. They were so rare (on average 4-10 days a year), so fleeting (2-5 days at a time), and experienced often as a mixed state that the euphoric hypomanias were 1-2 years apart from each other. With the depressions so long and severe I often forgot the hypomanias - or doubted my memories of them (did I really feel that way or was I just lying to myself?). Also since my bipolar is chronic I don't experience a ""normal"" so I thought the euphoric hypomanias, the only time I don't feel ""ill"" in some way, were my normal.

Even then apart from a few episodes I never really did anything you see in cliché depictions of bipolar. The vast majority of my euphoric hypomanias are intense goal orientated activity, rediscovering a hobby lost to depression, hatching overambitious plans, exercising to extent my muscles scream in protest, etc. There is a radiant sense of well-being and my mind glows, but it's not ""I'm so happy hehe"". It's a seductive sense of power, confidence, productivity, and creativity. Often the initial productivity spirals into counter-productive overactivity and eventual crash.

Yet the euphoric hypomanias were so short and so far apart I blamed myself for having got overexcited at finally being able to do things again. It was only with the hypomanias becoming longer and more intense (1-2 weeks now) that it became impossible not to see it for what it was."

I ""knew"" they weren't real but they felt so real I had to do ""reality checks"" (walking far enough away there was no chance I could be truly hearing them) to convince myself. If I got a panic attack during a mixed state and retreated home I'd have full blown voice hearing of police, ambulance, fire banging at my door or voices of folk I'd been with concerned for my wellbeing. 

I also got Alice in Wonderland syndrome - things felt massive and out of proportion, including myself. A cabinet that reaches my waist could look and feel like it was towering over me and suffocating my space.

Over the years a religious sleep schedule, dedication to routine, and regular exercise has *slowly* moved me from rapid cycling and reduced the burden of fatigue. There is now also clearer periods of mild depression with episodes of severe depression and hypomania. In mild depression I can manage to get by 5-6 days in a row but will then have 1-2 days of heavy fatigue. A lot of my progress has been learning how to deal with that fatigue and not letting it ruin routine. I know I'm moving into severe depression as the heavy fatigue days become more prominent and harder to deal with and I spend a lot of time during the day fighting off sleep.

I'm not asexual but close, I view my sex drive more as an annoying itch.

At worst my vision is like a fish-eye lens and anything close to me feels too close - its imposing and threatening. Multiple ideas boil simultaneously in my mind and rise to the surface of consciousness and disappear so fast they barely register - leading to sense of confusion and disorientation.

The same is true for all my mood states - my moods don't ""swing"" there a slow and slight ""phase"" towards depression/hypomania and then one day I'll wake up with big shift clearly into that mood state. 

Handling depression - mixture of routine and going easy on yourself. ""Don't think just do"". Depression lies to you, it makes you doubt every decision, it locks you into inaction. Routine helps - especially if you practice it when not in a deep depression. However expect yourself not to be able to achieve as much, it's ok not to manage all of your routine, just try to do a bit at a time and congratulate yourself for it - it feels cheesey but it does help over time. Getting into cycles of self-blame and focusing on everything you're not doing fuels the depression.

Endless sleep and constant fatigue are major part of my depressions. I find multiple alarms helps - dawn simulator, radio alarm, phone with maths alarm in padlocked bag, key for padlock next to coffee machine with timer so theres a cup ready when I wake up - everything setup to conspire against me so when I wake I'm forced up and forced to stay awake long enough to fight how easy it is to fall back asleep.

bipolar2,fg2sgex,t3_ewctnd,1580454012.0,"It took me 19 years to get a diagnosis and it was absolute hell. I developed symptoms at 14 and had a lot of mixed states and progressed to rapid cycling by time I was 18 - which research shows is common for those who first develop symptoms before 16. During my early 20s there was such constant mix of depressive and hypo-manic symptoms that I struggled to function.

Over the years I developed numerous systems and tricks to keep myself on track - I got a PhD and held down a job. Even then at best I only ""got by"" rather than ""manage"", there was constant set backs and periods lost to deep depressions. Struggling to live with bipolar was by far the hardest thing over those years - much harder than doing the actual PhD or any work related tasks I've had. The way academia works also makes it easier to hide how much I was struggling - I could work evenings and weekends to catch up on missed days. I would have been fired within a month from any 9-5 job or job with regular weekly deadlines. Sadly though despite how much of a struggle it was I had GPs and mental health ""professionals"" use the fact I had a job as evidence I was better than I claimed. Only one psychiatrist asked me *how* I achieved these things despite how bad I said things were - and unsurprisingly he was also the only one who suspected bipolar and picked up on all the signs.

Eventually, as I approached and entered my 30s I slowed the cycling and reduced the level of mixicity through a religious commitment to sleep schedule, routine, regular exercise, meditation, etc. This took years of effort and struggle to achieve - it was slow drip drip progress, major set back, start again, drip drip. It also did not stop the cycling or the extremes of mood/energy I experience - and it remained a constant struggle. I'm hoping now I'm finally on a mood stabilizer that might change."

However, increasing for all types of bipolar that view is now considered overly simplistic - though it can be true for some it just doesn't capture the complexity and diversity of bipolar. Euthymia basically just means any residual symptoms are not strong enough to count as clinically significant - but they may still impact a person's life. Functional impairment is still seen during euthymia for people with bipolar compared to healthy controls. There's also ongoing issues for many during periods of ""normal"" mood with emotional regulation and sensitivity to having their sleep schedule easily disrupted etc. However, the extent and severity varies massively. Furthermore, a lot of the longitudinal studies of bipolar that speak about periods of normal mood often use people who are receiving medication! Whilst that's fair enough as it'd be unethical to deny medication to people with a diagnosis - it gives a false impression of what bipolar is like for those who have not yet received a diagnosis. So whilst what I said may sound bleak, if you don't currently experience periods of normal mood at least know that with right meds there's good chance you can. Also, in my opinion, it's good to see the ongoing issues starting to receive more attention as it may mean better treatment options in the future - for example functional remediation courses (basically coping strategy training for how to deal with dodgy memory and difficulty concentrating) for people with bipolar. 

""Classically characterized as a cyclical disorder with full manic or depressive episodes separated by periods of euthymia, bipolar disorder is more accurately described as having a chronic and subtle course of mood disturbances with residual symptoms, emotional dysregulation, circadian rhythm sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and greater risk of psychiatric and medical comorbidity between mood episodes.""

bipolar2,ffz9ah8,t3_evxi8b,1580368139.0,"I've never been a big fan of mental health awareness days that focus on ""we all have mental health"" and ""just talk"" messages. Too often it results in vague talk of general mental wellbeing over the experiences of those with significant mental health issues and people talking about how exercise and a warm bath cured their depression. I actually find it makes me feel more alone. Also ""just talk"" is insulting when so many, at least here in the UK, struggle to access mental health services and when they do have dire experiences. For someone to be able to talk there has to be someone able to listen."
BipolarReddit,ffpvt0r,t3_eu62o5,1580107644.0,"After 19 years of symptoms and no improvement being repeatedly diagnosed and treated for depression I eventually diagnosed myself after an intense hypomanic episode, read as much bipolar info as I could find, then compiled a list of evidence to present to a new psychiatrist.

I had one good psychiatrist who suspected bipolar in the past but was taken off him by the head of service who suggested I may ""just have an unhappiness that can't be cured"". Also had a psychiatrist who attributed my symptoms to drug induced psychosis despite not having touched any drugs for over a year by that point in time. Even after the intense hypomania where I finally realised it was hypomnia the NHS service rejected my referral, interpreting the hypomania as me being ""much improved"" and therefore not needing to be seen by them again, so I had to go private.

What annoys me is how much my symptoms match everything in the bipolar 2 literature - often using similar phrases to what I had used to explain my experiences - , especially Jim Phelps stuff, but it took so long to get here with my symptoms often downplayed or ignored by medical professionals. 

Bipolar 2 is often described as difficult to diagnose but I believe that's mostly because people know the DSM-5 symptom list but not the diversity of ways they can present in patients. Only the good psychiatrist I had picked up on all the things listed as signs of potential bipolar (young age of first depression, repeat episodes of depression, family history of bipolar, failure to respond to 3 or more antidepressants, switching between hypersomnia and insomnia, & whole bunch more) but never explained well how that was indicative of bipolar. 

Similarly, when he at various times suspected dsyphoric and euphoric hypomnia based on what I said I was always hesitant as he never adequately explained difference between mania and hypomania. I knew only of the former, especially the cliché extremes normally used to explain it to the public, and saying hypomania is ""less severe"" doesn't really help. I don't blame him for that, there's dearth of good info for patients to help them understand as well. If he'd given me Phelps book to read in-between appointments I'd have been easily able to tell him he was right in his suspicions of bipolar. 

Sadly when he decided to try mood stabilizers was when I was taken off his care by the head of service who thought all I needed was CBT - which obviously didn't stop the cycling."

Sleep has always been the hardest thing for me so I may be bit extreme compared to others. The dawn simulator definitely helps but not enough in its own - I pair it with a complex alarm system to force me out of bed. However, compared to the complex system alone the dawn simulator definitely deceases the ""oh god no not consciousness"" feeling when the alarms go off. When things are going well it does help wake me just before the alarms would start. I also pair it with a SAD light when eating breakfast. There's mixed research on them for bipolar (with usual warning re can trigger hypomania) and whether best to using them morning or midday but I find 30 min each morning helps increase energy levels during rest of the day."
BipolarReddit,feufryj,t1_fetrdkh,1579386067.0,"Aye, my (euphoric) hypomanias are always 'obvious' in regard to the massive change in energy and mood but start so subtle. I always knew when they started and stopped but I had no 'normal' to compare them with to know what they truly were. Then given during (euphoric) hypomania depression recedes and anxiety melts away it just reaffirms the sense that 'maybe this is normal' despite the high/wired feeling underlying it and the ease in which I'm magically now able to throw myself into the world.

Then you'll have things like only getting 3-4 hours sleep one night as you're so hyped with ideas and plans - but function fine the next day. Yet often hypersomnia is my main issue. I've had countless times working with colleagues moaning about only getting 3-4 hours sleep due to baby, noise outside, etc but they seem to be functioning better than what I manage on 8+ hours sleep. So again I was thinking 'this is bit weird' to then remember such incidents and go 'well maybe this is normal'. Such thoughts weren't helped by GPs and psychiatrists also not noticing the hypomania and taking it as evidence of recovery when I mentiond them - even when saying 'there was something weird about it' and commenting on how fast the energy materialised and disappeared.

The subtleness tends to only last a few days - but then my hypomanias use to only last 3-5 days - before the energy gets out of control and I'm failing to multitask  5-6 different projects at the same time and generating ideas faster than I can take note of them. Yet given that'd peak intensity only last 1-2 days before the crash I again used to blame myself for 'getting over excited at finally being able to do things again' etc and think it was somehow my fault the energy suddenly disappeared. It was only from my hypomanias lasting longer, 1-2 weeks, where I'd experience this out of control energy for 8-10 days that I couldn't ignore that this was definitely not 'normal'."
BipolarReddit,fesu73a,t3_eqih2j,1579369023.0,"There's [research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/sense-of-hyperpositive-self-goalattainment-beliefs-and-coping-strategies-in-bipolar-i-disorder/D2525E19609AA766826AA5010F8E3F51) that a lot of people with bipolar identify with a mildly hypomanic sense of self - and this can create issues with managing bipolar. That definitely rings true for me, before I realised the episodes I was having were hypomania I always thought that was the 'real me' emerging from depression. Inbetween hypomania and depression I normally have a mild depression rather than 'normal' mood state so that radiant sense of wellbeing in hypomania felt more normal than the emptiness and unease of the depression.

I don't know if it's the same for others, but before I realised it was hypomania it frustrated me when in deep depressions where everything weighs down on me like a Herculian task knowing how much I can achieve when the 'drive and energy' (i.e. hypomania) takes me. I put so much blame on myself for failing to achieve what I could when hypomanic because I didn't know the hypomania as well wasn't normal. Even though its only been 5 months since I realised these episodes were hypomania its profoundly reduced the amount of self-blame etc I put on myself."

The obvious signs to me for euphoric hypomania are waking up before the alarm & being unable to go back to sleep, when I get out of bed colours are brighter & more intense, objects look more ""real"" with sharper more distinct edges, and often I'll have a desire to run and despite how long it's been since I last run manage to go a fair distance compared to what I'd achieve normally - feeling pleasure at the protests of pain from my muscles.

During the day things that make me realize it's definitely hypomania are a radiant sense of well-being (when it peaks it feels like I'm surging with power), my mind glows (ideas can flow so fast it's like I'm being showered in ideas), I find myself getting into a groove (even little actions like stirring milk into tea feel like they are carried out with finesse & gravitas - typing can feel rhythmic as if it's a percussive instrument), often it gets more intense over the day so around 5-6pm there's a surreal quality to everything & there's a creative abstract perception of symbolic meaning in everything (seen this referred to as 'magical thinking'), and over successive days it gets more and more intense where the initial wonderful flow and productivity collapses into a multi-tasking craze where I'm doing everything inefficiently and generating so many ideas and plans that it's hard to focus."

New Labour was better than yet more Tory governments, but that ignores what New Labour choose to continue, or slightly modify, from the Tories. Privitization, new public management, outsourcing, welfare conditionality, restriction on access to disability benefits, punitive justice policy, etc. This is what folk are referring to when they speak about 'Thatcherism' and the neoliberal othodoxy that replaced the post-war consensus. Also, in fairness, those who criticise New Labour in total tend to leave our Working Tax Credits, Sure Start, and the Minimal Wage - amongst other things - that leads to a false equivalence with the Tories."
BipolarReddit,fed0s31,t1_febu9nb,1578992938.0,"To be fair there is academic debate on whether borderline is part of the bipolar spectrum or not, especially given the difficulties differentiating it from ultradian cycling. The two are commonly misdiagnosed as each other and there's a fairly high level of comorbidity - though more people with borderline also have bipolar than people with bipolar have borderline. The broad consensus seems to be they are distinct diagnoses, but acknowledging the degree of overlap for some.

Key differentiating factors is mood changes are primarily driven by interpersonal events for people with borderline compared to time / stress for bipolar, a core trait of borderline is fear of abandonment, and borderline tends to swing from normal mood to anger/anxiety compared to bipolar's cycles of depression, euthymia, and (hypo-)mania. With many people with bipolar though tending to predominantly experience dsyphoric (hypo-)mania and interpersonal issues can be a huge source of stress it's easy to see how the two can be confused if the clinician has little time / information in which to make a diagnosis.

Given bipolar is mix of genes and environment - with people with bipolar reporting more traumatic and stressful life events in childhood than average - it's also probably not overly surprising that people with borderline have bipolar traits and people with bipolar have borderline traits."

I only had one psychiatrist who picked up on that, and all the other signs of bipolar, and he wanted to try other mood stabilizers. However I was taken off his care by the head of the service who diagnosed me as having mild depression and said the severe depression kept returning as I was being fatalistic so she sent me on a 8 week group CBT course instead - the end of which I was severely depressed and experiencing dsyphoric hypomnia. The psychologist running the course noted I was being ""productive"" and signed me off the service. The same service when my GP rereferred me after a recent intense period of hypomania (thankfully my current GP is fantastic and suspected hypomania a few times in the past) rejected it saying there was no need to see me as I was ""much improved"".

bipolar2,fe9zs5i,t3_eo3itb,1578942921.0,"Hopefully the psychiatrist was asking to determine whether you are rapid cycling or not rather than whether bipolar 2 or not. There's evidence that certain medications are better than others if you are a rapid cycler. Regular rapid cycling is defined as 4 or more episodes of depression or hypomnia per year.

DSM-5 specifies at least 4 days for hypomania. However, all the research shows no difference between those who only experience 1-2 days of hypomania and those who have longer episodes. 4 days was picked as an arbitrary cut off due to a fear of overdiagnosis. I think depression has to last at least two weeks according to DSM-5 but it's again arbitary decision behind that. What's probably more important is that unless you have ultrarapid cycling (mood switching every few days) then a few days between same mood state doesn't make it a new episode. For example if you have 4 days hypomania, 1 day with ""normal"" mood, then another 4 days hypomania thats still treated as single episode. 

My first hypomnia was longest I've had - 3 weeks. Majority since then have been 2-5 days. However in last three years they've started lasting 1-2 weeks on average. 

Depressions last anywhere from 2-8 months - though also experienced plenty depressions of only a few weeks."

I've had 7 different antidepressants and had range of responses. Most didn't work. Citalipram was hell that I'm guessing now was a mixed state - had old patronising bastard of a GP tell me that was a sign it was working. Mirtazapine caused incredibly unstable hypomania, as in rapid switches from depression to hypomania and incredibly fast ramping up of the hypomania each time it switched, for a couple of weeks then no effects after that.

A lot of information sites for the public say that antidepressants cause mania in those with bipolar when in fact there is diverse range of responses discussed in the academic and clinician literature. Some become hypomanic, some manic (even if they are bipolar 2), some get mixed states, some rapid cycling, some nothing at all happens, some it works incredibly quick then suddenly stops, and for some antidepressants actually work - even though they have bipolar 2.

Most research shows on average it takes 10 years and 3-4 psychiatrists for a person to get a diagnosis - and the research that focuses specifically on bipolar 2 tends to get slightly longer average time. Length of time varies by country as well. In Scotland, where I live, the only research I could find found the average time to get an accurate diagnosis was 13 years."
bipolar2,fe9u549,t3_eo2wnx,1578941444.0,"There's a lot of debate as to why it takes on average 10 years between symptoms starting and getting a diagnosis. However, I think a massive reason is the utter lack of awareness of bipolar amongst many mental health professionals beyond the cliché up down mood charts used as teaching aids. I'm still fighting to get a diagnosis. Current psychiatrist is open to bipolar but wants to consider other options as according to her bipolar doesn't show until around 20, whereas I was 14/15, and you'd expect periods of normal mood in-between episodes whereas I have residual depression. Most academic sources, and NHS Scotland (I live in Scotland), say most people develop symptoms at 15-19. Also the academic and clinician literature is filled with discussions about the difficulties chronic dsyphoria between episodes poses for treatment and recovery. 

I've been feeling both intense relief and anger the more I read about bipolar 2. So much of what's in the literature beyond the DSM-5 symptom lists describes my experiences perfectly - things I've told mental health professionals about for over a decade yet I've repeatedly been misdiagnosed, ignored, and patronised. Itll be 20 years this year since I first started experiencing symptoms and it should never have taken this long to still not have a diagnosis confirmed.

There were legitimate criticism of Corbyn and his team but too often members of the PLP acted like petulant self-entitled shits that unsurprisingly alienated the membership they repeatedly showed absolute disdain for.

The left use to be fairly open after Corbyn was elected the the plan was party reform and then Corbyn would step aside for another left-wing candidate. The PLP made that impossible and both sides became entrenched. Too many viewed it as war of attrition whereby if they just kept chipping away and holding out then they could reclaim ""their party"" (that had been stolen from them by ""a cult"" that happened to include the majority of pre-2015 members) once Corbyn was forced down.

However, what I've found helpful in the meantime is reading Jim Phelps books and The Bipolar Survival Guide. Phelps books in particular go into depth on the variety of experience in Bipolar 2 and it's been reassuring to me how so many of the things I've spoke about for years are mentioned as common experiences.

Recently told a friend that I was in process of getting a diagnosis and, as I anticipated, he was slightly suspicious at first. I think that is due to the way bipolar is understood as Bipolar 1 with little awareness of Bipolar 2. I told him as he's noticed the changed with (euphoric) hypomania the most over the years and I wanted to get an idea of how folk would respond. There's been a few times he's joked whether I'm taking the drug from Limitless given the change in hypomania. Thankfully Phelps' books cover the full range of hypomania including summary tables so I was able to send him copies of them to explain and relate it to things he noticed.

The Bipolar Survival Guide contains sections on how to discuss your diagnosis with family members. I'm 33 now and had issues since 14. I've never told my family as I was originally diagnosed with depression but plan to tell them if get Bipolar 2 confirmed. My mum is fantastic but cares too much and would have viewed my depression as a personal failing. I was also depressed a lot of the time for absolutely no reason which folk seem to struggle to understand as they assume you must be depressed about something that you want to talk about etc. With bipolar being mix of genetics (my father had it) and environment I'm hoping my mum will be able to understand it better instead of thinking it's her fault. The one risk is she is definitely the type who'll start checking how I am everyday and take small signs as evidence of my mood and start to worry. There's thankfully section in Bipolar Survival Guide on that that I'll be asking her to read and will then send a copy and paste of if each time she starts checking in too often. 

Also nice to see a fellow Scot of this sub! You may want to see if Bipolar Scotland run a group near you.

bipolar2,fddtwiw,t3_ekulv1,1578323867.0,"Sorry I can't offer any real advice but I know the horrendous struggle dealing with the NHS is. NHS Mental Health services are supposed to follow a ""recovery approach"" that maximises quality of life. Often this gets reinterpreted by practitioners to ""not immediate suicide risk"". In my experience, few medical practitioners follow the recommended guidelines which I'm guessing is mostly due to being overworked and underfunded. Most clinician guides where there is a co- morbidity recommend that bipolar mood swings need to be stabilised first before any therapy - with emphasis that the therapy is needed to secure recovery long-term.

If you haven't already, it might be worth writing a short summary of the difficulties you still experience due to your trauma and how that risks destabilising your moods long-term and that given the relative stability you have at the moment you'd like to deal with this now rather than keep putting it off and worsening your quality of life. Make sure to throw in buzzwords like ""to help with my recovery long-term"". Also the regular advice is to stress how bad things are when you are at your worst rather than focusing on how things are on an average day. 

If unable to recontact psychiatrist then give it to your GP. Depending on the region you are in GPs can refer you to other services directly rather than having to go back to the psychiatrist. If not at least you then have a statement to give to psychiatry team in new area to hopefully speed up getting the right help."
BipolarReddit,fddq3jp,t3_ekm9rn,1578320945.0,"I've never found anything that ""works"" and waiting for confirmation of diagnosis at next appointment. However, I have a *ton* of things I do to help manage my moods and take the edge off things. I use to be a rapid cycler but now have a more normal cycle of 1 severe depression and 1-2 hypomanias / dsyphoric hypomanias per year. This has taken years of effort to build with little help as I've been treated as having unipolar depression for over a decade. I've had plenty of medical practitioners when first meeting me start by giving me the usual basic CBT type advice then back off once they realise how much I already do yet still experience cycles in mood.

The main mantra is ""in routine we trust"" - routine is my religion. I have a complex alarm system to get me up in the morning. Regular beeps on phone in morning to remind me to keep on schedule I should be meditating, exercising, in shower, or just about ready to leave for work. I have a FitBit with alarms for ""leave the house now"", ""lunchtime walk"", ""stop working and go home"", ""prepare everything for next day"", and ""go to sleep"". I also have wee rituals for when I get home from work, preparing things for next day, etc that I use to practice mindfulness and spot any warning signs. I try to exercise daily and walk to places where ever I can. There's good number of times now where I can spot my depression sliding from mild to moderate (I always have some form of residual depression) and catch it before it slides out of control.

Obviously when things slide to severe depression or hypomania this doesn't all hold together. The point though isn't to self-blame but use these to spot changes early and try best can to stick to them no matter my mood state. For example, in severe depression I can fail to get out of bed to then fall asleep on sofa but I use the reminders to prompt me to at least take a lunchtime walk, prepare things for next day, and go to sleep at regular time. It helps stop things spiralling. Also found with hypomania being strict with sleep schedule keeps it on the fun productive end of scale rather than spiralling into overactivity and 3am Amazon spending sprees for things to help with new plans. Getting sleep with dsyphoric hypomania is much harder but the few times I've been successful it's killed the worst of it. Also found exercise during dsyphoric hypomnia can help lessen the feeling of desperation I have during it.

As said it's taken over decade to build this and more. For example, I divide up all my household chores and have them as repeat tasks on my phone. Crucially they are colour coded to denote urgency and due dates are spread out so there isn't everything on single day. This helps keeps on top of things in severe depression. And if things get too bad I can always dismiss the minor urgency tasks. Also means even if majority of a day is a wash I can at least aim to do a single urgent task and have some sense of achievement and fight feeling I'm in a losing battle.

A final thing, to keep the post relatively short, is I bulk buy mixed nuts, vegetable juice, pickled foods, and frozen meals without preservatives (COOK in UK). This means even in prolonged period of severe depression I get a semi-mixed diet and have lot of easy things to eat when I can't muster energy to get to shops nor prepare a proper meal. 

As said it's taken over a decade to build all these systems bit by bit. The sleep schedule in particular was the hardest and still the one that can be disrupted the easiest. The key is not to self-blame, when you ""fail"" - breathe, positively acknowledge that at least you've noticed you are struggling with routine, ""in routine we trust"" and go. If not able to muster energy, say calmly to yourself OK I don't need to do X, Y, Z but at least get the basics ready for tomorrow when the next alarm goes and get to bed at regular time.

I've had bipolar for 19 years now with very little support so creating all these systems was only thing I could do to ""get by"". It's never manageable but it's how I manage to give illusion to world that I'm well. Sadly I also think with medical practitioners who aren't good at their job take what I manage to do as evidence im well and can be dismissed from their service. The one psychiatrist I had who listened, and suspected bipolar, was also the only one who asked me how the hell I manage to keep a job given how bad my symptoms are, and was impressed at my various systems, rather than tell me having and keeping a job was a sign I was well."

I misinterpreted them as the depression finally leaving and the movement to overactivity me getting too excited at finally being able to do things with ease for a change. I was always creative so the outpouring of ideas and plans felt like my creativity returning. It left me absolutely puzzled by what magic the depression had left as there was never any trigger and also blaming myself for letting myself get carried away and ruining it.

Dysphoric hypomania given how awful it always is I misinterpreted as the peaks of depression. Again they were clearly abnormal given I went from being unable to move to feeling compelled to move filled with desperation, agitation, and constantly on edge. However, dsyphoric hypomania despite how common it is is rarely discussed on mental health information sites so I had nothing to help understand it. An early warning sign of dsyphoric hypomania for me is despite having quit smoking for over 2 years now it always feels like I have a 60 a day habit and just tried to quit cold turkey. I've quit numerous times in my life but started smoking again during dsyphoric hypomanias. 

In last two years my hypomanias have gone from 4-5 days to 1-2 weeks so it was only a 2 week positive hypomania where I could no longer ignore how abnormal it was. I always described my depression as ""weird"" but it's only now the more I read on bipolar the more I recognise all my ""odd"" symptoms were bipolar symptoms."
bipolar2,fcyavl0,t3_ej1azu,1578077354.0,"I support assisted suicide at end of life when the remaining time and death will be painful or extremely unpleasant. However, it concerns me when this is applied across the board so anyone at anytime can express a wish to die and be legally killed. There are countless times in my life where I'd have opted for death - and (thankfully) was unsuccessful in my own efforts. The issue is such desires for death despite how overpowering and forceful they were at the time were transitory and did not outlive the moment. One moment of weakness could be the end of me if assisted suicide was legal across the board. Assisted suicide is fine when there is little life left, for everyone else we have ethical responsibility to reduce suffering and help create lives worth living."

bipolar2,fcnh6yx,t3_ei25rh,1577811631.0,"This varies hugely and from what I've read the ""feels fully rested on little sleep"" is rare. I know I'm having positive hypomania as I'll wake 30 min to 1 hour before my alarm - despite normally never waking before my alarm. I'll also have to force myself to sleep at night as got so many things I want to do. Whilst I'll end up sleeping 2-5 hours per night I function better and feel better than I normally do with 8 hours sleep per night. (With the caveat that the less sleep I get over consecutive days lead to more and more intense hypomania where I've so overwhelmed with ideas and energy I can't be productive). However I don't feel ""fully rested"" - but then I never feel fully rested. The tiredness also doesn't bother me anything like it normally does and I can ignore it most of the day. The better descriptor I've seen clinicians propose is ""gets by with less sleep"" for positive hypomania and for dsyphoric hypomania ""inability to sleep despite fatigue"". When I have dsyphoric hypomania it takes me 2-4 hours to sleep each night, I'll wake every half hour to 2 hours, and be overwhelming tired during day but unable to nap. That switch from hyposomnia to insomnia is often listed by clinicians as a common sign that a patient should be screened for bipolar."

I find the classic models for explaining bipolar incredibly misleading and the more I read other people's experiences, explanations from clinicians who specialise in bipolar, and the academic literature the more it resonates with my own experiences.

For example, was just reading an article that explained euthymia is officially defined as scoring 8 or less on the Bipolar Depression Rating Scale. On that you can have depression, sleep issues, anxiety, loss of pleasure, and trouble concentrating but as long as they are all mild score 5 points! What I call ""melancholy"" between episodes of severe depression would score 6-8 points so I do experience euthymia. Official definitions of euthymia also don't include any recognition of psychosocial impairments which are also common for people with bipolar between severe mood episodes. It's astounding that the classic model gets away calling these ""normal"" mood."

I had one fantastic NHS psychiatrist (he was one who first proposed I may have bipolar but sadly he didn't explain it well) but the head of service took over my care from him, diagnosed me as merely 'mildly depressed', sent me on group CBT course, and I was then discharged from the service despite having returned to severe depression and suicidal ideation by the end of the course.

Corbyn and his team were dire at media strategy and made numerous fuck ups over the years. (Side note: the social media team were phenomenal in last few weeks though we also need good traditional media strategy). This was compounded by Corbyn having long history as backbencher providing wealth of stuff the media could throw at him all at once and left lasting initial impression.

A centrist #FBPE politician would have had an easier ride in the media - look at the way the Guardian etc fawned over Change UK despite lack of impact with actual voters - but would have led to similar loses from alienating Leave seats and offering nothing appealing to young voters. We need a refined left-wing platform with better messaging and a leader who is better at handling media attacks. Seriously all those claiming Labour lost due to not being Remain and Centrist enough look at the polling results for the Lib Dems.

A younger left-winger with better media strategy has a solid chance. As said in another thread though I'd support Rayner and Long-Bailey on a joint ticket.

bipolar2,fa6k5cm,t3_e7thni,1575825452.0,"I'm currently waiting for a new assessment to see if I have Bipolar II. I started experiencing depression at 14 and I'm 33 now. I was always aware of the cyclical nature of my depression - I go 3-8 months of mild-moderate depression followed by 2-6 months of severe depression. This cycle is then punctuated on occasion by either 2-5 days (in rare occasions 1-2 weeks) of either feeling like I'm drowning & bouncing off the walls or hyper-productivity with edge of surrealness (becoming counter-productive if really intense as everything draws me in & I discover new interests and hobbies).

Whilst I always knew there wasn't something quite right about the latter episodes they never fitted cliché descriptions of mania and often with the more positive ones I had GPs, psychiatrists, and psychologists take it as evidence that I was recovering despite me stressing there was something weird about it. Even with the bad episodes where I was getting into panic attacks when filling in job applications, struggling to sleep 3-4 hours a night, and had a return of suicidal ideation I had a psychologist try to tell me that was good as I was being productive compared to how I was the previous few months.

Then ironically, when my current GP, whose fantastic, and the only competent psychiatrist I ever had queried these as potential mania I cast doubt on the suggestion as it wasn't mania as described for Bipolar I. It was only due to a recent 2-week long and incredibly intense episodes that realised these may be hypomanic episodes. I was seeing a psychologist at the time who said she obviously can't diagnose but it sounds like a bipolar type disorder and recommended a psychiatric re-evaluation. Sadly, that was 4 months ago and been repeatedly rejected by the NHS for another psychiatry assessment - so I've arranged a private assessment for next week.

I think the main issue is that hypomania remains poorly explained. Many websites do not explain it further than 'less severe mania'. When a lot of the examples of mania used are quite extreme - such as conversing with angels, gambling the family home, cheating on partner with 4-5 different people, etc - it's very hard to decipher what exactly is 'less severe' but still abnormal. Most also start explanations by saying that mania/hypomania is extremely happy, overjoyed, euphoric etc when these are some of the least commonly reported symptoms by people with Bipolar I and II. Additionally, a lot of people with bipolar ii don't speak about 'mood swings' but 'energy shifts'. So whilst I was experiencing phenomenal levels of creativity, drive, energy, and passion I would never say I was 'happy' or 'overjoyed'. So despite knowing the criteria for bipolar it never clicked.

Similarly, some of the criteria such as 'over-active' are obvious to a 3rd party but not the person experiencing it. When you go from having 6 weeks of rubbish piled up in the house to it being deep cleaned, driveway weeded, grass cut, fridge full for first time in months etc that isn't perceived as 'over-active' - it was bloody necessary."

bipolar2,f77gfiq,t1_f77bqvl,1573455524.0,"James Phelps in his book ""Bipolar, Not So Much"" notes that ""happy"" is one of the least reported bipolar symptoms - majority even in the midst of mania reported being depressed. Instead of improved mood a lot of folk, particularly with hypomania, notice significant shifts in energy. I always dismissed bipolar because mania/hypomania was described as ""happy"" and ""elevated mood"". Yet switch mood for energy and I match all the other symptoms.

Aside from mixed states I think its hard for folk to understand how you can still feel depressed during mania/hypomamia - and I suspect the diagnostic criteria of happy/elated is more medical staff perception of manic patients than patient experience. When I wrote a document for a psychologist of my experiences I struggled to emphasis I still felt depressed, although less than normal, during potential hypomamic episodes as when writing about the creativity, productivity, everything drawing me in, satisfaction on completing even the most minor tasks, etc even I was thinking ""this sounds like I'm elated"". Despite the repeat emphasis that I still felt depressed during such episodes the psychologist kept referring to me as "" elated"" when we discussed it.

Another issue is vast majority of websites, including bipolar charities, include cliche extreme examples of mania to explain bipolar with hypomamia explained as merely ""less extreme"". But when youre reading about people selling their family home to gamble, speaking with angels, and having multiple affairs its hard to tell what exactly is "" less extreme"".

Edit: Phelps website is also incredibly good - https://psycheducation.org/diagnosis/ - there's so much on it that IMO should replace the list of DSM criteria and cliché experiences used on a lot of websites. I've only followed the bipolar subreddits for a month but in that time I've noticed the ""is my diagnosis correct"" threads appear every 1-3 days. Most of them seem a result of the stereotypical way bipolar is explained because it doesn't match the poster's experiences. However the stereotypical explanation leaves out the way folk with bipolar explain their own experiences - and the diversity in experiences."

At my worst I once slept 9 hours overnight to fall asleep sitting on sofa for a further 13 hours - full on deep sleep with no waking inbetween. As a result I have ""insane alarm clock systems"" -

Phone with maths alarm, have to answer 5 ""hard"" maths questions to turn it off, phone in padlocked bag next to bed, key for padlock in kitchen (used to be garage before moved to a flat), wake light timed to reach peak at same time as phone alarm, key for padlock next to coffee machine set to have coffee ready for when I get up. Then depending on how bad the hypersomnia is additional alarms on phone to ensure I'm still awake, enforcing a ""no sitting"" rule whilst eating breakfast, cold showers, exercise (even just 5 minute walk in cold air), asking someone to phone to ensure I'm still awake, etc etc.

As awful as all this sounds it does get easier over time - I now use a simplified system more as a fail safe rather than being necessary every day. Then whenever hit bad depressed phase again I ramp it up and add back in whatever elements are needed to force me awake.

Having a strict sleep schedule also makes things slightly more manageable (again becomes more difficult whenever in severe depressed phase). I treat my sleep schedule as a religion and try to ensure I'm consistently in bed 10pm - 6am."

Only one psychiatrist took that seriously, and suggested multiple times it may be bipolar, but given I didn't understand what bipolar was - only aware of the way it's represented in popular culture - I was resistant to the idea.

It's like the perfect routine I always desire but struggle and fail to achieve for months becomes second nature and everything flows. Yet it then forsakes me after 3-4 days and I'm back struggling to maintain any form of habit or routine - or the energy shifts to being unmanageable.

When the surge of energy is too much and unmanageable I end up repeatedly jumping out of chair to pace, shift between 4-5 projects, become overwhelmed with outpouring of ideas, discover love for new hobby, spend money on hobby believing investing in it will help keep the newly found energy going, work on side projects before and after work - and on lunch break, fail to force myself to sleep at reasonable time as the motivation to keep doing things is too strong (and is so fucking intoxicating when spent 4-5 months with no motivation at all), and eventually burn out in 3-4 days.
