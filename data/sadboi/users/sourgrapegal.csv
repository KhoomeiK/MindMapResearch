BPD,fnchdgi,t1_fnch07f,1586836791.0,you have this figured out down to the bone. i think about this often. about how i feel sad solely for the other people surrounding me and not at all for myself. and that one of the driving forces behind staying alive is to appease the masses. but it’s never for me. i agree with this 100%. you are so spot on.

BPD,fmytamm,t1_fmysvnx,1586495111.0,this was amazing to read and amazing advice. i’m so appreciative of you sharing. this pandemic is hard and i don’t have any friends. i’ve been talking to my sister a lot but we are very different and she tries but i know it’s hard to understand what it’s like for her. there also so many friendships and relationships that have ended years ago that i still dwell on. it feels like a curse. but writing down the lyrics that speak to me will be my new thing to do! thank you so much!

BPD,fiuym3k,t3_f9zns5,1582750612.0,i had this struggle because i usually tweeted whenever i needed to express myself no matter how dark or disturbing. but i recently deactivated my twitter for that reason and then i switched over to reddit lol which i think is good for discussions and expressions
BPD,fiujwxd,t1_fiuhcoh,1582742809.0,thank you so much ♥️ this means a lot to me especially because i have no one to talk to about feelings like this. so the solidarity is everything i need.
