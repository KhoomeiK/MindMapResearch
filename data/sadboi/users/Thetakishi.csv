One sec there’s another part. “These findings are of great interest, because the relevance of collagens and ECM remodeling in the onset of epilepsies is widely accepted (Dityatev and Fellin, 2008), thus highlighting a fundamental role of the ECM in brain physiology and pathology.”

“As evident from the studies described above, CNS diseases linked to ColVI span a remarkable range of tissues and compartments, from the hippocampus to the optic nerve, and from neurons to brain vessels, thus pointing at a broad implication for ColVI in the proper maintenance of CNS homeostasis.” This was after a section addressing epilepsy and alzheimers.

“We found collagen XVII to be expressed widely in the brain and to be located primarily in the soma and proximal axons of neurons. In contrast, glial cells did not express collagen XVII. The expression varied strikingly between different neuroanatomical regions, being most notable in motor nuclei and Betz cells followed by pyramidal neurons”

""Newer findings suggest the lack of psychedelic action arises from the phenomenon of biased agonism. Stimulation of the 5-HT2A protomer within the 5-HT2A-mGlu2 receptor complex evokes psychedelic effects, while these effects do not occur during sole stimulation of monomeric 5-HT2A receptors. Accordingly, different G-proteins are involved.[6][7] Lisuride behaves as an agonist at the 5-HT2AR monomer. Since it competitively antagonises the effects of LSD, it may be regarded as a protomer antagonist of the 5-HT2A-mGluR heteromer.[8] GPCR oligomers are discrete entities and usually possess properties distinct from their parent monomeric receptors."""

so ideally you don't want it to sit out at all unless you've already filtered it, because that kind of defeats the point of a cold water extraction. The cold water is for filtration of the tylenol, more so than extraction of the hydro. Pull it out of the freezer, and use at least a shirt quality filter immediately to get most of the gunk out, then do the coffee filter, so that way it doesn't take an hour to filter.
