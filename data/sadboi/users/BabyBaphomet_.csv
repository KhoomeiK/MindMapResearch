childfree,fnjbrc2,t1_fnizd3k,1586995791.0,"Blind means your vision is 20/200 or worse even with correction. So if you wear glasses and your vision improves to say 20/100, you're not blind you just have poor vision. I want to get that out of the way first because most people think blind = 0 light perception. That's extremely rare. Most blind people can see some things.    
    
I can't see my fiance's specific features 99% of the time. But I've seen pictures of him that I can zoom in on to see all the details. Then I guess my brain fills in the gaps when those features are too cloudy (some things even disappear completely) to see. One bonus is he says he's super insecure about his blackheads and occasional acne but I've never seen them lol.     
     
Another thing is a lot of blind people became blind later in life. So even if you can't see anything you still know your preferences. Some blind people ask friends to ""review"" a potential dates photo lol. Because you can tell a little bit about what kind of person someone is based on their body language, clothes, hair, etc. It's still very important!   
    
Hell, blind people wanna look nice too. We get tattoos, do our hair, get piercings, pick out clothes based off of our own style and what flatters us. I have an eyeliner wing stamp that makes me able to do the eye makeup I enjoy without looking. It's kinda cool. I don't wear makeup often but I'm able to just do it on my bedroom floor without a mirror.     
    
I'm sure some blind people don't care about that stuff. But it's probably the same percentage of sighted people that don't care about looks. It's just a preference. Losing your vision doesn't mean you have to give all that up."
