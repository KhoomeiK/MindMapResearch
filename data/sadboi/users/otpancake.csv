- if you don't have a schedule to follow (kids, early zoom meetings, work), do what I do and just stay up as much as needed to knock you the f down (my routine has been 5am -2pm and since nothing matters theses days who cares at least I sleep, right ?)
- consider this : you are under really weird and exceptional circumstances that are fucking many people up mentally and maybe you can totally take half of that xannax tonight, because there's a literal pandemic going on and you deserve those sweet sweet hours of medicated sleep and relaxation. Things will change, you'll go back to work, time will pass and you'll be able to deal with this without medication. What's important is right now, don't be too harsh on yourself"

You should try something out. Some people like therapy, other like hypnotherapy or ergotherapy because it's more of a guided session (when therapy is just you talking about whatever).
