I always thought they were the happiest memories, but I found  the things I said and my overall character in these interactions utterly repulsive. I was over the top, spamming messages, boasting over nothing, constantly going on about girls I liked and how cool I was. The most charitable thing someone said was ""you're weird... it's interesting and entertaining"" while most others straight up ignored me after about four messages. Christ.

I sent my best friend from school a long message last night in apology for how I acted. Reading our conversations broke my heart. She was going through some tough things at school and trying to open up and I was just constantly spamming her with messages, making jokes, not taking her seriously at all, sometimes even insulting and then acting like a petulant child when called out. I always wondered why she never opened up to me but loved hearing me talk -- it's because I may have been entertaining in this state but I sure as shit wasn't worth being close to. I'm surprised she stuck it out considering how much of a fucking weird and overbearing person I was in mania."

With regards to the lack of a sense of self, I find this is owing to the psychosis and bipolar. Like, when your personality broke in mania, I think the resulting trauma sometimes manifests as fear to embrace yourself. You're afraid you'll slip back, you know what I mean? But I want you to know that you're still you, bipolar can warp things at times but it's still you underneath it all. 

My view on your worries is you have to take all the allowances you can, investigate with your uni -- are there special consideration options for exams? Can you take them away from students on a PC or something? Are there options for extending assignment due dates? Take advantage of these when you can or feel things are getting difficult, with bipolar your mental health is a priority now. Your pdoc should be able to write you something (illness staying anonymous if need be) to get you permission to access the special consideration options. It's how I got through high school and uni with BP1, and I believe you'll get there :)

I will say though that yes, I was that asshole for a brief period, 1-2 years nearly a decade ago while I was recovering from psychosis, undermedicated, and wasn't getting proper therapy.

To me at least actions like that speak way louder than the arguing you both do, which seems not to go anywhere. If you've both got bipolar and are both in episodes, why are you trying to make each other see reason when you each probably lack the capacity for totally clear thinking. Just show you love each other instead, support for me at least as a bipolar 1 is worth way more. Talking doesn't work imo, with my illness some days I forget even what was said or what was done.

The people who know me well and have seen me on less than good days might think ""How does he know that? He must be bipolar"" and that's what I want. Plausible deniability, especially in the workplace where mental health discrimination is rife.

To tell someone outright is hard though imo because you really have to trust that they won't hold it against you or act weird. I really really have wanted to explain it to the three bosses I've had, because I respect them enough to believe they should know the full story behind how I act sometimes at work, but based on comments they've all made around mental health I know they may not take it well or understand.

For example one went on about how an uncle or something had bipolar and turned up to a wedding, and he said it was really sad (in a kind of dismissive way) to see the guy ruined by medication, shaking all over. And recently I've had a boss whom when I mentioned something about mental illness said ""We all suffer from mental illness"" as if she was trying to relate how she feels on a downer day to lifelong mental illness. Like fucking bullshit, there's a difference between chronic mental illness and a blue day. Fully turned me off letting her know. We've even butted heads occasionally since, because despite saying ""my door is always open"" that in a workplace translates to ""I will toe the corporate line where need be and dismiss your problems"".

Like I told her about problems I was having with my mother (she blew a gasket so hard my housemate said next time he'd call the cops) and how it was impeding my work and my boss just told me about how her husband went out drinking one time and came home hungover so she made him sleep in the car, as if to say ""Yeah, we all got problems, don't tell me your life story this is a workplace"", she even said we should have a mask up at the workplace. How the fuck do you mask bipolar disorder? It's written all over your mood.

BipolarReddit,f0dshrs,t1_f0dan39,1568558069.0,"I thought Daniel Johnston's songs were powerful and spoke to me with regard to the illogical yet strangely powerful nature of stuff like mania and depression. His songs felt like how I feel in those moments.

I don't disagree that he didn't look after himself, but he never held himself up as someone to admire for mental health struggles. I saw his doco and found it nuts when he crashed his Dad's plane or his obsessions over a best friend (jeez dude let it go she's not interested, how many times do you need to be rejected?), but tbh that's the sort of shit that happens with this disorder, we do dumb shit. I guess I don't understand the gawking sentiment because for me my appreciation of his music was very personal and detached from the general consensus. Perhaps that's just how neurotypicals would view the people who suffer bipolar who don't look after themselves terribly well.

I see someone not to admire for these things, but just to accept that he suffered what we do and he walked the same path. I love his music though, and for me it's a catharsis to listen to. 

That song Walking the Cow, it's apparently about shouldering burdens but for me I just listen to it and think of some guy walking a cow and it makes me smile. Life in Vain has to be one of the best songs I've ever heard about toughing out the ups and downs of bipolar life. Story of an Artist is just heartbreaking and is the story of so many of us with talents and dreams and not conforming to neurotypical life. Every song hits so damn close to home for me, they're so beautiful and heartfelt.

tl;dr Dude had his issues like we all do with this illness but damn he made amazing music in spite of it."

Just this year when I moved house, my mother tried twice to steal a spare set of keys from my housemates so she would have access. Thankfully I got the key back but not without confrontation. My housemates banned her from our place. Their overcompensating actually inhibits me growing as a person and becoming independent, and it's all linked to their fear over my illness manifesting again.

I am 28 years old and really it is ridiculous that this sort of thing happens with my parents."
BipolarReddit,eyvu1sk,t3_cz3fzq,1567511707.0,"With my parents it's because they believe I'm their pride and joy who never grew up and never had a problem. My bipolar diagnosis meant I became frozen in time, forever a 16yo whose life needs perpetual micromanaging and supervision to prevent another manic episode. 

It's taken me over a decade to gradually break it down, but I think this was because my parents genuinely didn't want to believe I had a disorder. When I was first diagnosed my Mum cried. They simply can't accept that I have a lifelong mental illness and overcompensate at every turn to prevent bipolar symptoms. I still find it hilarious my psychotic manic episode was referred to as 'a blip' by my parents -- 'so you don't have another blip'. I spent weeks in a mental hospital, pretty big fuckin blip."

It's good at least you have a better understanding of yourself now. Even if being a lawyer doesn't pan out it doesn't in any way mean a career in law is off the table.

A mental health national registry is fucked up. I hope that never happens.

But please take solace in the knowledge of how much the US government does for mental health in response to mass shootings -- absolutely nothing.

I wish healthcare would be better in your country, there is definitely the money, but the funny thing about scapegoating mental illness in this mess is they walk themselves into a political paradox -- to frame it as a mental health problem would mean funding healthcare to do anything about it. And those politicians blaming mental illness typically also don't want universal healthcare when there's private industry.

So, nothing will happen. For government to do anything would mean funding the very thing they hate -- big government in their healthcare."
