buildapcsales,f8oeh31,t1_f8kvthz,1574676534.0,"I have the R-51Ms and the promedia 2.1, and I would say that while the R-51Ms sound better, they only really shine when listening to music. The promedias still sound fantastic and you don't need to get an amp. Plus the subwoofer helps a lot to make the sound full. Of course it really just comes down to your budget, but the promedia set at $119 is fantastic value.

&#x200B;

On the other hand the reason I went and got the R-51Ms was because of the upgradability. I eventually plan on getting the R-120SW subwoofer and a couple R-820Fs or something similar and create a complete surround sound home theater. the promedias are harder to use for anything other than what they were made for"
BudgetAudiophile,f72yu0j,t1_f72ve59,1573384841.0,Good idea. Any suggestions? I'm currently looking at the Sony STR-DH790. I'd rather get something half decent than have to upgrade later.

Anxiety,eumqe8d,t3_cgyxgp,1563919147.0,"My situation is quite similar. I graduated high school last year, but have not gone to college. I got a job for a month or so, but it was stressful enough that I left without a word. Ever since then I've just been trying to ignore my anxiety, and unfortunately it worked. I lie to myself every day as if everything is okay. I have no goals that I am actively pursuing, and I feel completely stuck. I am lucky to have friends to spend time with else I would be too isolated to stay sane. I've recently started taking a medication for my depression, but it hasn't truly changed anything. If I don't do something, I'm going to be stuck living with my parents for years to come.

I don't have any advice for you, but all the hope and sympathy in the world!"
