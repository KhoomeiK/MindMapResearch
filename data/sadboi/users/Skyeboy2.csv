feemagers,fpuaitx,t1_fpu6lp4,1588908290.0,i do agree that the pandemic is adding a lot of stress in them and i give them a bit of leway for that but this had started from before the pandemic really started and its just getting worse im trying be mature and look at it from another perspective but its being so hard constantly hearing the wrong gender all the time every day im doing what i can but i dont think in strong enough
Idiotswithguns,fpu7xdn,t1_fpu7rjv,1588906622.0,thank you this is 1 of the few debates where theres a good level of maturity and im loving this thanks this is actually a good time
Idiotswithguns,fpu7rf0,t1_fpu5y6o,1588906517.0,"oh yeah i do agree that both parties are at fault within the video but i think that both cops who are supposed to be trained in how to deal with certain scenarios both of them where overtly violent, carless and a danger to not only the man in question but also the 2 other people and 1 whom got shot as a result of her poor handling

id say that for people trained need to be reavaluated and those 2 cops need to be held accountable for multiple injustices and immoral actions that needlessly hurt people"
Idiotswithguns,fpu2rsb,t1_fpu0cws,1588903430.0,"theres a difference between being in danger and having your life threatened her life would not have ended if she didnt shoot him a simple body lock could have been done (for context im not being an out of touch badass who thinks she knows everything but i have been doing martial arts for 10 years so please dont think im trying to be a hero or something sorry and thanks) the level of violence thats deemed ""expectable"" in the US needs to be revised and changed its unethical and immoral to shoot an unarmed, untrained, mildly aggressive intoxicated civilian

she should also of clarified who shot so the other guy wouldn't kick his skull in but as another point he sees the suspect on his knees literally not a threat at that moment and visibly with no ranged of melee weapon in hand or near him

the second cop should of not kicked but even if it where warranted to kick he should of kicked the shoulder it would of had the same effect but be much safer 

also thank youuuu most people just say ha lol you cant spell and don't actually participate in the debate and thank you for being a good mature person to debate with <3"
Idiotswithguns,fptzvh3,t1_fptyrib,1588901680.0,"that cops life was definitely not in danger the guy just simply not want to get arrested (like most normal people do) so she pull a firearm on someone who hasent even punched her or anything all he done was grab her but another issue is the second cop for kicking the guy in the skull (can be fatal, give brain damage or at best a concussion) and then proceed to verbally abuse the guy 

&#x200B;

i think the guy who stole something is defiantly in a wrong point but the 2 cops are ever worse for handling the situation so awful a gun was nowhere near necessary or validated and nether was the front kick the the mans head

ps. sorry for bad grammar i am dyslexic"
Idiotswithguns,fptwhck,t3_gfiudu,1588899660.0,fucking police brutality both of those cops are fucking terrible attempting to shoot a unarmed civilian and extensive verbal abuse

iamverybadass,fnvtmoj,t1_fnvszgz,1587304436.0,"i mean not really if your forced to live in a system you don't like and reject you still need to go with it until theres change

the exact same can be said if you switch things up so say in any socialist society from communism to anarcho communism if you where a capitalist and owned a phone or computer you could say your a hypocrite coz you have something made by socialism it goes both ways and dosent make you a hypocrite it just means you have something made by something you dont agree with"
iamverybadass,fnvstft,t1_fnvsj3x,1587303789.0,i mean i cant reject all capitalism because if i did id be poor or dead in this society just because i own a product dosent mean my points are invalid most other leftists who also hate capitalism own some tech its not uncommon
