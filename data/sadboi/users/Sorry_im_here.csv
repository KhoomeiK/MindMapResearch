SuicideWatch,fosggrb,t1_fosevwg,1588030229.0,Studying has been stressful and I’ve not done any work for 5 weeks (whoops?) teachers are chasing me for my work and I feel trapped. Also gender dysphoria (trans ftm) has really been ruining my mood. It sounds like not that big of a deal I guess but with my family’s pressure it’s so much worse. What’s going on with you?
SuicideWatch,foseitl,t3_g9astq,1588029152.0,I feel like this a bit as well. It maybe linked to them not being interested in your mental well-being so a reaction from them makes you feel better. This may not be correct but I hope it helped somehow :)

SuicideWatch,fn9h4gm,t1_fn9gxkc,1586772789.0,I understand you were angry and I completely forgive you. Maybe it’s good that you released a bit of your anger on me. Don’t feel bad it’s completely normal to feel that I’m just another person trying to act like a hero by lying to you. Feel free to rant to me about anything and I don’t mind if that includes being rude because sometimes you’ve just got to release all your anger on someone.
