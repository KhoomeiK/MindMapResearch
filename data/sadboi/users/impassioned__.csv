tretinoin,foq8plj,t1_foni1ya,1587986863.0,Well you’re washing of your medication! So after cleansing your face properly you should (on damp skin) apply your moisturizer and then about 30 minutes later you can apply your tretinoin (and the other in whichever way you were told to)
tretinoin,fomeui7,t1_foljm9k,1587887467.0,Are you saying you wet your face after you put on the tretinoin and the hydroquinone (which you mix together)?
menstrualcups,fm1wocm,t1_fm1j19y,1585686359.0,Are you saying the fact that it takes so long to insert on the toilet is what might end up causing the leaking as opposed to doing it in the shower? I have no problem pushing it high since I’ve cut my whole stem off basically but I’ve heard that angling it to the cervix can be harder if it’s too high up
menstrualcups,fm1dq97,t1_fm1cy2e,1585676559.0,It’s also the angling of the cervix I’ve noticed! Def wear a pad too until you get to the groove of things I just had my 3rd cup using period and am mainly struggling on my first/heaviest day
menstrualcups,fm1dl79,t1_fm1cnt2,1585676487.0,So I’ve heard drying the cup completely is better in preventing leaks for the sealing and because there may already be fluids on the walls! I’ve never tried lubricating it first or doing it in the shower.. does that help minimize leaking?
menstrualcups,fm1dfel,t1_fm169nj,1585676407.0,Hey which cup do you use? And how would you say you managed to stop the leaking? I loveeee my lunette 1 cup but really can’t with the leaking! I do the rotating inside me as much as I can and trying to tug at it to make sure it’s there! I’ve ever been confirming it’s open now by running my finger between the cup and the walls which allows tightening as well! I’m not sure if my issue is a first day issue more than anything or if it’s the angling towards my cervix regardless it is def no where near full when it leaks so idk! Any tips would be much appreciated 🖤🖤

menstrualcups,flc0ww6,t1_flbwdzw,1585017196.0,What do you mean a clean insert? I do clean it off in the sink then dry it as much as I can because I’ve also been told it’s better if the rim is dry! I’ve also heard people say if you can get it in before your period it’s better but I’m not really sure how that makes sense? I get it the initial time but then every other time that you empty it and put it back in won’t your walls have fluids again? So confusing!
menstrualcups,flc0osz,t1_flbw8wn,1585017050.0,How do you put it in your cervix? Mine is def not low low it’s normal to a little lower depends on my time in the cycle but the first time I tried it before my period actually started I ended up cutting the whole stem off and I can still use it so def not a high cervix but I think it is tilted to the left
menstrualcups,fl92uy6,t1_fl8zt79,1584939239.0,"Thank you for your response! I appreciate you taking the time to do so. It definitely is so frustrating to feel like you’re trying all these different things and doing all the research but that’s it’s still happening. I agree that the cup leaking is NOT like tampon leaking at allll. I think that’s what scares me is that I can’t trust that it won’t leak and if it does leak I know it would be terrible whereas if I took the risk with the tampon I always knew it wouldn’t be the end of the world. What’s interesting in my case is that it’s definitely no where near full and has never been maybe a quarter max, generally pretty low. It also must be angled right because it is getting in there. I do the tuggling the twisting 3 times to really secure, today I even started doing the whole put your finger all around the walls to make sure it’s open but it’s still here are the outside which is odd to me. I’m wondering if it’s not pointing at my cervix as it should be so it’s slightly missing or something but I have tried different angles so that’s where I’ve been confused and felt videos weren’t really helpful! I have no problem emptying it more frequently if that were my problem (although def frustrating) but my thought is if I’m going to be leaking and using pads anyway then I’m not really saving money or the environment. I know you said you were never really leak free, was that because of the heavy flow filling it up or or because of the positioning itself? I’ve also heard things about the fact that the vaginal walls already having menstrual fluid leads to leaking regardless! My main issues are coming from the “real” full on period days not necessary the really light days or spotting. I worry that a softer cup would be too soft because I’d heard strong vaginal muscles can mess you up with them. It would also really suck to have to keep buying new ones to try! I love the concept so much so I’m hoping I can master this because people seem to say that if it’s being used right that there should be no leaking or if anything panty liner amount of leaking"

You want that with cleansers serums niacinamide moisturizers etc. you don’t want that with things like bp and retinoids because it makes it way too harsh for your skin. Optimal use is avoiding irritation because that means you’ll be able to maintain it. You’re just being too harsh on your skin now and compromising the skin barrier. Those active ingredients are very strong and go through the moisturizer so I do niacinamide from the ordinary, cerave moisturizing cream wait 30 minutes then a pea sized amount of tretinoin only then wait till it dries before sleeping so it doesn’t come right off on my pillow"

tretinoin,fl6sx87,t1_fl6fyhe,1584882352.0,"I was still purging from the tretinoin and being impatient about that so when theyd come up I’d also use salicylic acid spot treatment 1+ times a day on it sometimes I’d dab a bit of benzoyl peroxide too and clindamycin so a whole cocktail to try and make it go away quick and it would work but then I’d be left with hyperpigmentation because I am very prone to it. I stopped that completely and instead added a fullface layer of clindamycin 1% and a layer of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide to my AM routine to manage the purge breakouts and for PM was told to leave the tretinoin to be on its own. I stopped spot treating completely and I’ve been fine except for the occasional hydrocolloid bandaid on pimple trick which works pretty well! Since then I’ve found research to compare clindamycin to niacinamide so I’ve added niacinamide from the ordinary instead to my AM and PM routine and it’s been a game changer. It is one of the only things that doesn’t disrupt tretinoin and is really so underrated. I also encorporate chemical exfoliation into my routine mainly the AHA BHA peel from the ordinary (1x a week) or the glossier acne exfoliating toner (every other day or couple of days) and that would then be in my morning routine. Ever since I’ve been using niacinamide I feel like it actually has strengthened my skin barrier so I haven’t struggled with any kind of dryness or sensitivity to the active ingredients anymore. That plus in the PM On damp skin I work in the niacinamide then the moisturizer, wait 30 minutes then tretinoin.
Anyway I don’t know how side tracked I got but hope this helps someone!"

I’m not sure what type of tretinoin you’re using (gel, cream etc) or what type of skin you have but generally it’s best to moisture. The cerave moisturizing cream is great! If you’re generally pretty oil they have the cerave moisturizing lotion which is lighter. Also as the other person adviced applying moisturizer on slightly damp skin then waiting 30 minutes then applying the tretinoin then waiting a while before going to sleep is ideal.

SkincareAddicts,fl1zsaf,t3_fm1xa4,1584739773.0,"It could be cosmetics if you use any blush for example? Also soaps can be harsh a non soap cleanser like the hydrating cerave one is highly recommended then just work it in for a good minute 2x a day! It looks cystic/possibly hormonal but I’m not a dermatologist so only speaking from personal experience and reading a lot of stuff from dermatologists. Always best to keep it simple so if you’re not already cleansing 2x a day making sure it’s really getting clean, moisturizing twice a day (cerave moisturizing cream is great), spf (non chemical, those can be irritating), avoid fragrance ingredients. Those are great basics that already would be so helpful. In regards to any kind of acne salicylic acid/benzoyl peroxide washes can be really effective in trying to combat and manage breakouts and are much better tolerated than leave ones in my opinion and are just as effective. Zapzyt for the salicylic acid is affordable and fragrance free of if you go with benzoyl peroxide then panoxyl. In that case you’d use one of these washes morning or night then the cerave hydrating cleanser the other wash. Honestly if you’re not already using any of this stuff, you should already see a different but then if you still don’t dermatologists can give you things like clindamycin or azelaic acid which are anti inflammatory or you can decide to go with a prescription retinoid as well like tretinoin (great antiagain benefits as well). Prescription medications aside from the clindamycin will have an adjustment period of dryness and purging for up to 3 months ish then can be really great! Niacinamide from the ordinary 2x a day is also a game changer in minimizing pores, preventing scarring, helping with already present scarring, and just strengthening the skin barrier overall which is especially helpful when using active ingredients since those can compromise skin barrier. A study actually showed that niacinamide was just as effective as prescription clindamycin for some acne. If you do try that it does have a little sting at first so don’t let that worry you!

Hope at least some of this is helpful!"

SkincareAddicts,fkva001,t1_fkv4duu,1584565032.0,"Yes niacinamide from the ordinary twice a day, greaaat product! I’d also stay away from the sun regardless. As someone who used to love tanning and more recently in life switched to the path of skincare. The sun destroys your skin, elasticity, collagen etc and then that’s destroyed your pores become less tight leaving to similar issues that you’re having. If the redness is irritation, rosacea etc the niacinamide is safe and that initial sensation is perfectly normal. I’d definitely stay away from any kind of products that have fragrance and keep your skincare routine really clean like cerave hydrating cleanser for a minute, rinse off really well with not cold nor hot water then really work the niacinamide in until it feels a little tacky then cerave moisturizing lotion also worked into the face. With rosacea and sensitive skin less is always more and the key is to be superrrr delicate with everything you use and do. The niacinamide also helps strengthen the skin barrier and is an anti inflammatory which helps with many of these issues.

Most of all people spf daily, that will make all the different and use a non chemical sunscreen cause those can cause lots of unwarranted reactions!

Goodluck 🖤🖤🖤"

I try to keep it as his chill zone and trick him into going in there and letting him just settle for a while then rewarding him when he’s out. He can definitely also be a little snappy which is hard.

SkincareAddicts,fkmr7zj,t1_fkmqkqo,1584337105.0,"The dermatologica moisturizer and line in general does have fragrance which could be irritating! If you can stick to a basic routine it would be good like the cerave moisturizing cream instead! Jojoba oil is light but I’d cut out the oils for now cause they can be pores clogging for sure so you want to have a hydrating minimal routine so you can feel things out. I think the hydrating cerave cleanser is great and most recommended my derms. Idk which Cetaphil one it is but avoid foaming cleansers and when you’re cleansing try to massage it in for about a minute and really cleanse. Depends which witch hazel you’re using if it’s alcohol free or not but I’d put that away for now and focus on sunscreen instead. Sunscreen can give bumps if it’s a chemical sunscreen, those can cause irriation and are less coverage than the mineral ones. Exfoliation wise try to keep it simple like twice a week and not in the same routine as the retinol so morning or day instead of night. The ordinary AHA BHA peel is good and cheap but use it as directed def not more. Also glossier has a toner that’s called exfoliating treatment i think that’s pretty good as well for a second exfoliation option. To strengthen skin barrier help prevent dark spots, help fade some existing spots, reduce sebum, and minimize some pore stuff try the ordinary niacinamide it’s very well tolerated and cheap as well (can be used up to twice a day).

I’d cut out everything with fragrance and go for a basic skin care routine that’s fragrance free. Also lots of things to consider, do you wear makeup? Are you cleansing properly? Sunscreen can be harder to get off that you think. Why are you exfoliating specifically? Also niacinamide is not a spot treatment for acne. It is under rated and has great benefits and very well tolerate so it’s likely not that that is irritating your skin. Cerave hydrating cleanser massaged in for a good minute is a pretty good go to and then niacinamide on damp skin then like a cerave moisturizing lotion if you’re deligent with even just that you’d see a difference. Also whenever you’re chemically exfoliating try not to do that on damp skin cause damp skin is like a sponge is soaks you the product so def not with exfoliating acids.

tretinoin,fkldtpj,t1_fkkmu8b,1584304170.0,That was likely from the purge not the moisturizer! Also a little moisturizer goes a long way. Something great for your skin barrier if you’re willing to add the extra step is cleanse really well then on damp skin use the niacinamide from the ordinary then the cerave moisturizer then wait 30 minutes tretinoin let it dry for a bit before you sleep so it doesn’t come off on your pillow
tretinoin,fkldl53,t1_fkkc8ny,1584304022.0,"That neutrogena one although advertised as a moisturizer is not occlusive enough so it acts more as a humectant which means it pulls water in from your skin but there’s nothing to seal it with so it evaporates and can make people a lot drier for the most part although if “feels nice.” I’d go simple with the cerave moisturizing cream! Cleanse face really well and then on damp skin put that moisturizer on it can be used all over the face, eyes, neck etc then wait 30 minutes until it’s all fully dry then put the tretinoin on. Hope that helps!"
tretinoin,fkld5dk,t3_fj161x,1584303744.0,I’d definitely switch to an actual cleanser like the cerave hydrating cleanser instead of miscellar water esp if you sunscreen daily (which you ideally should be doing). At the very least try to stick to a cleanser the tretinoin and a cerave moisturizing cream and spf every day. It’s interesting that you started off with 0.1% because most start off with 0.025%! Hopefully you’ll be done with your purge soon cause 3 months is around when it stops but also if you’re not cleansing and hydrating properly that could definitely be delaying the process!
tretinoin,fklcgml,t3_fj338e,1584303311.0,YES HATEDDD IT it’s because tretinoin speeds up turnover but doesn’t exfoliate so 1-2 times a week you wanna chemically exfoliate like glycolic acid! Mine got better when I added exfoliation into the mix just make sure it’s not during your night routine and also I’ve noticed my black heads kinda being pushed out which is also annoying but I think that’s also all turnover. The exfoliating will help loads!
tretinoin,fkiuqno,t3_fipd8y,1584229103.0,"Dermatologist glycolic acid peels help too! And just some time. You also have to make sure you’re using peels 1-2x a week cause tretinoin speeds up turn over but doesn’t exfoliate. Your exfoliants are glycolic acid, lactic acids, salicylic"
tretinoin,fkiujto,t1_fkiq9lp,1584228972.0,Niacindamide (the ordinary one is good) then moisturizer then wait 30 minutes then tretinoin
tretinoin,fkfymfi,t1_fkciy1u,1584145644.0,Have you found any cheap hydrocolloid packs? I found one on amazon but I think the surface area wasn’t big enough!
tretinoin,fkbqz6x,t1_fkaih30,1584038183.0,I totally feel you I’ve been purging too it’s finally slowing down a bit but the tretinoin is speeding up the skin turn over by ALOT so all the acne that’s stuck inside and was going to come out eventually is coming out sooner in waves! I try to remind myself of that and try so hard not to mess with it so I don’t get hyperpigmentation because I was doing that for a bit and going overboard with the spot treatment on top of the tretinoin and def got some dark spots from that! Now I try not to touch the breakouts at all but the good thing about purging is that the acne comes and goes quicker. On a day to day basis until I get past that 3 month mark my derm gave me clindamycin and a low prescription of benzoyl peroxide that I put in the morning with my skin care routine at night I don’t use any actives! I also have a salicylic acid wash that I try to add in there earlier in the day maybe one or twice a week esp on my tzone area. I hope some of this is helpful (:
tretinoin,fkbqiwa,t1_fkapc89,1584037932.0,Thank you for the tips! I have to check out that sponge I’ve seen talk about it on this page (:
tretinoin,fkbqg9r,t1_fkaisnx,1584037893.0,"Thank you for the tips! I’ve been mixing the tretinoin with my moisturizer for my neck specifically and that’s helped recently so I’ll keep doing that for neck and eye area. Do you do your eye lids too or just under eye? 

The reason I mean the exfoliants part is because I notice if I don’t my skin starts feeling a bit textured like all this turnover dead skin is just on there esp on the nose area.

I started using it around Jan 15th so about 2 months in! Not experiencing dryness or flaking anymore and have built up to every night in the last week or two still a little bit of purging though :("
beauty,fka729m,t1_f2u5d93,1583994956.0,Did the rogaine ever run? I’ve heard the only prob is that it travels and when it does hair grows wherever it does?
SkincareAddicts,fka6kjk,t3_fh9xdl,1583994417.0,First aid beauty has one called hydrating toner on Sephora
tretinoin,fka2s83,t3_ffzjrw,1583990502.0,Moisturize on damp skin wait 30 minutes then tretinoin then wait another 30 and moisturize again if you’re really dry but if you don’t already do the first part then you can even try that first! I saw in the comments that you use vitamin c but I could have misunderstood if you do though keep it in the morning in a different skincare routine or cut it out and try niacinamide in the morning instead! For antioxidants in skincare vitamin c really doesn’t do much anyway you’re better off taking it in through food or like green tea everyday to protect your skin from free radicals pollution etc
tretinoin,fka2axx,t3_fg0kiq,1583990042.0,"Make sure you’re moisturizing on damp skin then waiting 30 minutes then using tretinoin. You can even wait another 30 minutes and moisturize again. I have eczema and am acne prone so I know to avoid fragrance in products (which everyone should try to anyway) but that could also definitely irritate skin! 

Goodluck 🖤🖤🖤"
tretinoin,fka235n,t1_fk27h0j,1583989838.0,I assume it’s much more likely that it’s purging than the dermaroller but if you are using a dermaroller make sure you’re soaking it in alcohol for a bit not just running alcohol over it! I also definitely would not tretinoin on damp skin. I’d do at least a thin layer of moisturizer on damp skin then 30 minutes later use the tretinoin
tretinoin,fka1weo,t3_fg90vm,1583989664.0,So dermatologist say that feeling of your face been so clean that it’s tight is actually really bad! I use the hydrating cerave cleanser it’s highly recommended. I use cerave in the tub but because you have oily skin I would stick to a lotion formulation like the cerave lotion! If you get the tretinoin gel because you’re worried about the fact that you’re oily def buffer with moisturizer first. I mean always moisturize first but to minimize dryness and flaking (at the very least) that would help (:
tretinoin,fk9zl58,t1_fk7uueo,1583987689.0,I’ve heard from a few skin care experts that miscellar water should not could as a step one of double cleansing ESP if you use makeup and/or heavy zinc sunscreens. Ideally you want an oil cleanse and then something like cerave hydrating cleanser. I’d also def look into if any of your products have fragrance and stick to fragrance free stuff. I know the fresh brand has fragrance in their stuff! Hope you get what you’re looking for 🖤🖤🖤
tretinoin,fk9x0ws,t1_fk84dll,1583985699.0,Great results! Do you moisturize after you cleanse before you tretinoin? Also which raw Shea butter? Do you feel like that’s too heavy/makes you break out? I’m not sure what you’re skin type is but I assume acne prone like us lmao
