antidepressants,fll5crm,t3_fkv5l7,1585253920.0,"I'm currently in the same situation too. I've been on Mirtazapine for 3 years, also had Serotonin Syndrome from Cipralex. Because I am so sensitive to medication it took me 6 months to reach 30mg/day and much longer tapering off. I've been incrementally tapering off over the past year by intervals. Took me a while to get to 15mg/day, very nauseous that first interval. Went onto 15mg every 2 day mid-last year. Since I work from home now, I decided to move to 15mg every 3 days since two weeks ago. Tapering off by spacing out a day at a time as I prefer not to cut my pills and in my experience I have less withdrawal symptoms this way. 

My withdrawal symptoms are usually: migraines, brain fog, lack of focus, elevated but manageable anxiety, nausea to varying degrees, slight disruptions in sleep (but no insomnia yet) and my BFRB habits have surfaced again. I noticed that my mood slightly fluctuates more often now, but this is probably because I'm inside all day for the past few weeks. Some cardio will definitely fix this.

I try to schedule my tapering intervals during a time period with as less projected stress as possible. This COVID situation incredibly stressful and not great for anxiety, but working from home does help with not having to bring my mental health to my workplace."

Maybe at first when I was feeling way too overwhelmed, and I started to numb myself as a defense mechanism. But I understand that phase needed to happen for me to survive.)

However, medication is not a permanent long term solution to structural societal issues that are directly correlated to mental wellness. For some people, mental disorders can be also be a genetics or chemical imbalance issue. But this is also just part of the greater picture. Medication can't fix poverty, social isolation and toxic workplace to name just 3 things out of 1000000. In my experience, my financial security is the strongest indicator to my mental wellbeing.

depression,ezvg5zf,t3_d2gf9e,1568176918.0,"I would agree that depression with onset at a young age is difficult to treat because it goes untreated for a very long time. The general assumption is that children are supposed to be happy and don't get depression at a young age. Mental health awareness and emotional literacy isn't exactly integrated in our schooling system and parenting know how. 

I do think there is a difference between using the term ""untreatable"" and ""incurable"". Depression has no cure but there is treatment despite varying degrees of success. People in remission tend not to be found reaching out for help around this thread. 

Mental health awareness is a relatively modern phenomenon. So it while it may seem like there's suddenly a massive generation people who are depressed, it's also because we have new diagnostic procedures for evaluating mood disorders. The current statistic is one in three people will encounter some form of mood disorders in their life. Don't panic yet. This just means society is trying to be more inclusive of people who were deemed abnormal.

I would say the only long term side effects are the weight gain and appetite stimulation. Prior to starting meds, I had lost a significant amount of weight and gained 20 lbs after. I have insomnia so greatly appreciated the sedative effecta. In my experience, I didn't have a lot of scary side effects. Although when you're starting a new medication/dosage, it does take some time (week or two) for your brain go calibrate to new chemical changes. For me it usually feels like I have a bad flu. 15mg is considered a good starting point. If you find it's too much you can split the pill in half and take 7.5 per day and slowly work up to your ideal dosage. 

If you're unsure, see your gp first before starting. If you have anxiety, take it easy for the first few weeks. I find anxiety elevated my side effects. I know it's scary when you're taking meds for the first time. Glad to see you're getting treatment. Best of luck!"

You feel like shit and then should get better if you're compatible. Takes some time for you brain to adjust to the chemical changes. Same thing when you're coming off medication, can't stress how important it is to properly taper (decrease dosage incrementally) in order to avoid severe withdrawal effects. 

When it comes to ""addictive qualities"", again varies from one med to another. Just risks you should be aware of especially if there is history of substance abuse. 

Not sure what you're mother was going through but I found my medication to stabilize my mood swings. I'm never gonna be perfect but it gave me booster in conjunction with following treatment plan and therapy. Took a year or two to reap benefits and I'm slowly tapering off my meds now that I'm functional.  Don't know what's gonna happen next but meds got me through a difficult time. I would say I had a positive experience with a few hiccups here and there.  Figure out if you are willing to handle the trade offs.

Even so the technique is so helpful when you use them the second you feel shortness of breath or predict a incoming trigger (identifying your triggers also helpful) or just feel anxious in generally. Doing quick breathing practices just before you fall asleep is also a good habit so that you learn how to relax. 

Also in order to get control over your panic attacks (versus panic attacks controlling you), it's soooo soo much easier to just let it happen. At first, it's natural to fight with your panic. When you can learn to initiate/release a panic attack, you have more control in stopping one. Over time, this may take years, it'll become a muscle.

A few years back I told my myself that I'll do my best even if there was a chance that nothing will change or I'll eventually give up. This was the commitment that I made to myself. 

Followed my treatment plan, evaluating on what worked and didn't work. I've tried many strategies: exercise, diet, meds, therapy (I called every clinic and service provider in my area to get a few free sessions), CBT, volunteering, peer support groups, calling helplines, mood tracking apps, meditation, trying new hobbies, blogging, training myself to identify thinking traps, negative and ruminating thoughts...most were entirely out of my comfort zone. Some things worked better than others, and when I fall back into an episode I go back to my treatment plan and therapy exercises. Sometimes it's one step forward and two steps back, but that's the process of learning. There's no guaranteed results. Learning is a process of continuous setbacks and maybe eventually you can identify some progress (but again, no promises/guarantees). 

I'm at a functional place right now but it really took years to get here. And yes, I still have weak moments, at first quite frequently until I can see sometimes predict when they'll happen. And the more I push through those speed bumps which really look like mountains the better I get at overcoming them. Sometimes I hate myself for still being here and I question what this is all worth, but I'm still here. For this moment, that's all I need.

In fact I had once promised myself that I wouldn't be here at this moment, but I made a commitment to do something and I am still here.The fact that you're still here right at this moment reading this already means *something* too.

Privilege works both ways. Women have certain privileges attached to their gender/sex just as men do. This is not to compare who is more privileged or oppressed. Part of feminism is recognizing that different identities in each human affords certain privileges/oppression whether from sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, etc. This concept in feminism is called ""intersectionality"".

My therapist had encouraged me to keep a daily journal for the things I was grateful for each day. This really helped shift my focus from negative to positive thinking. May sound stupid, but some days I would be grateful for taking a shower and that was all I needed that day. As I started celebrating my small victories, I moved onto bigger tasks. So say I want to make myself dinner this weekend, break that task into smaller tasks so it's more manageable (ex. decide what to make on Monday, get groceries on Wednesday, etc).
