dating_advice,f8cpf2i,t3_e05et0,1574465712.0,"This is not exclusive, this is just sex way more than just cuddle- buddies. You sound like you want an actual relationship and he may not. There sounds to be commitment issues based on how you determined what you have decided to call your situationship.

You both need to be honest with yourselves about what you're looking for and be willing to walk away from each other if what you want doesn't match. Right now, may not be the right time for the two of you to be together."
datingoverforty,f7uvr7d,t3_dxqfjj,1574018389.0,"It does so long as you communicate with your child your intentions for dating. In this scenario, your daughter could be jealous or not like your boyfriend, but you will never know unless you talk to her. A conversation along the lines of, ""(child's name) do you know how much I love you? Even so mommy needs a different type of love too, this is why I like (boyfriend's name). He makes mommy happy. I would like for you to have a good relationship with him too, but I need you to talk to me if you don't feel comfortable with him or have concerns...""

You should also have a conversation with your boyfriend and see how he is feeling about his interactions with your daughter. It will keep you aware of his feelings and allow you to know if you are missing something or overreacting.

Communication, communication, communication.


Best of luck."
datingoverforty,f6vmml2,t1_f6vlwxv,1573191200.0,Well it definitely sounds like you are invested. The IG thing seems odd to me too. I would say just keep verbalizing your interest and ask for clarification from her.
datingoverforty,f6vkxkg,t3_dt7oxi,1573189448.0,"Distance and lunch breaks aside, you need to decide if you are interested in being a part of her freetime whether she has her children or not. In essence, how invested in her are you? Are you ready to accept everything that she is or are you only comfortable with the 60 minute lunch version of her? Dating a single mom requires you to be committed to her. we have trust issues centered around who we introduce to our children. Her needs and the possibility of an instant family have to be a priority for you. She probably is not looking for a father figure for her children, more looking for someone for herself but must consider whether you are someone who could be around her children. You also need to be transparent about what you need and want from her. 

Just my opinion as a 40F to a 14yr old. Hope this helps."
relationship_advice,f6qemca,t3_dsiaos,1573075866.0,The fact that is is bothering you and you asked about it and feel he wasn't truthful with proof means you know what you need to do. I appreciate your self respect and hope the next guy isn't a d-bag.
relationship_advice,f3sqx4k,t3_dhxioa,1571107403.0,"Sounds like you are jaded and holding her up on a pedestal, it can be uncomfortable for the recipient. It also starts coming off as insincere. 

Try not complimenting her or telling her how into her you are for a week. Then at the end of the week, try for another week, then again for a third week. Lastly for a fourth week. If at the end of week four you still feel enamoured with her, you can tell her you appreciate her...once. Then start the cycle again. 

To help you get through the month, get a notebook or stack of post-it notes and write down what you would normally say to her. This will gdo 2 things for you...allow you to stick to the plan of not saying anything to her along those lines and you will have the visual representation of whether you are really being excessive."
Marriage,f3slptr,t1_f3ruvg8,1571104862.0,"You're married now. She is the one person you should not be making half-hearted comments to. Say what you mean and mean what you say! That is rule number one in married communication. Try to enjoy your new family member having a contentious relationship only makes things harder between you and the dog and you and your wonderful wife.

Best of luck OP."
Marriage,f1ggpx7,t3_d99olo,1569466918.0,"Maybe his love language is not physical affection, hence sex and your pleasure aren't really a priority. He may show love through doing non-sexual things for others. Ask him how he shows love. Tell him how you see him showing love. Tell him how you show love and how you feel showing love and when it is reciprocated. 

Take the time to learn how each other show love. Once you are both aware of how each other shows love, the sex will be better. You have to talk about it together though."
relationship_advice,ezh9w5c,t1_ezg6158,1567907525.0,"OP should definitely do this but tell him to meet tonight as Brandi. That would clarify everything for you, since you are supposed to sleepover at his place. Plus, personally I'm not sure how you are able to sleepover anyway, I would be bursting at the seams trying not to say something. 

Best of luck OP."
Parenting,ezh6whl,t3_d11uwo,1567906370.0,"1. rest of the month w/o phone.
2. wash dishes every day
3. no friends over or going over to friends houses for 2 weeks (more if she gets an attitude about it)
4. take the door off the hinges
5. change the wifi password (everyone in the house shouldn't suffer) and only allow access for 2hrs after school for homework purposes.

As a savage single mom to a 14yr old girl, this works!"
relationship_advice,ev2t96t,t3_ci6jqg,1564183314.0,"He doesn't respect you and possibly only dating you because he needs to dominate you.

This comment solidifies that:
 “why isn’t your confidence through the roof?”

If you exuded all the confidence he feels you should have, you probably wouldn't be together or together for long. You would not tolerate the disrespect.

Best of luck OP."

You should walk away now, discuss seeing other people, or tell her what you truly want in a partner and move from there. Best of luck."

relationship_advice,eoiidor,t1_eohos00,1558620379.0,"This. All of this! Your husband has one wife. You! whether he is at home, work, in the streets, wherever he is, his wife is you.  His little ""friend"" at work is putting herself in a situation she is not fully prepared for. 

You have every right to speak to your husband about what you' ve been told, but do it with confidence in yourself. If he and she continue their antics go to Human Resources and make a complaint. Their current actions are not appropriate for the work place. Your husband is being dumb and easily setting himself up to be accused of harassment by this 23 yr old or anyone offended by their antics. 

You're a mom and the best thing you've done in life this far is bring a child into the world (unless you've also cured cancer, aids, hunger, or some other medical marvel). If you still love your husband and cherish the relationship (not the family you built, just what is between you two) you have to fight for it. 

Being a grown up sucks. You have to work hard to stay mentally positive about yourself, work hard to maintain a personal relationship with your significant other, work hard to be a good parent and not question whether you are ""doing it right"".   OP let me tell you, that you are more than likely doing it right. Let me say, that you are gorgeous, smart, and can get through anything. Do not compare yourself to a 23 year old trollop that your husband has the hits for right now. Lay the law down on what you will and will not accept."
Parenting,eoig8he,t3_brx3zh,1558619004.0,"DNA test first. File child support on yourself if the child is yours, so that there is documentation of what you two agree to. Always show up for your child, always pay your child support. Do not let emotions between you and the mother (there will be some; positive and negative) cloud what you have to be to your child.

If you really like the girl that you are seeing now, you have to tell her right away about the baby. 

Congratulations!"
