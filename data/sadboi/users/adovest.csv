GetOutOfBed,fqo3tlg,t3_gjg1bc,1589507005.0,"I’m 23 and I realized a year or so ago that my mind just wouldn’t often register digital sounds. Similar to you I can max out volumes on certain things, have the most godawful annoying sounds, and I’d sleep through it. 

Ironically, I could be sleeping through a blaring alarm but be able to softly wake up to my mom calling my name from downstairs and stuff like that. 

I’ve since started using those old school bell alarm clocks (I have 2 from amazon - I got a second one bc sometimes in a zombie-like haze I turn off my first one and go back to sleep without thinking about it. Either way though, I hear them. They’re obnoxious as hell but they get me up. 

I’ve also learned I have to rotate them around my room - and always having my second one in an odd location (currently in the corner on the top shelf of my bookshelf so I have to stretch to turn it off). Really wakes me up lol.

Either way - your struggle sounds very similar to mine. I’d highly suggest looking into a bell alarm clock - or anything non-digital."
EDAnonymous,fng0tb9,t3_g1diyr,1586919682.0,I thought the same things when I first saw it. Seeing that and realizing I had no one who cared about me - especially at a level as close as that - was super distressing for me.

My only motivation right now is getting a job so I can move out and not be living with my parents, which has only been making me worse. It’s hard most days though given the current job market where it feels impossible and that I’ll be stuck living here forever - which I definitely won’t let happen. 

I just keep having to tell myself that this won’t last forever and that it’s more acceptable to take other jobs other than ones in my field (a major pressure since I just graduated and felt like a failure at).

CPTSD,fm8d7at,t3_ftfk5m,1585847262.0,"The way she went out about this discussion is completely unprofessional. I'm really sorry you had to experience that. It is hard when you have that bad feeling from the beginning, but because of our experiences, we naturally try to push past it and ignore it. Additionally, with her over-sharing and insensitive comments, I think it is best to go to a different provider anyway. 

I am so sorry you experienced this. I think it also expresses her inability to be flexible and work on the therapeutic relationship on her end. If you weren't even aware you were being asked to do things, she could say ""I could try to communicate that better in the future"" instead of blindsiding you like this. It sounds like it is more about her than you tbh. A therapy relationship requires work from both the client and the provider. My therapist and I regularly have conversations about what is working and what isn't working and how to proceed. 

I think you will be a lot better off (and may actually see some progress) with a different therapist anyway. In looking for a new one (I wouldn't take any of her recommendations since she isn't reputable to begin with) - [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) is a good resource and how I find most of my providers. Additionally, given the complexity of our situations, although I don't know yours specifically, I'd suggest looking for someone trained in DBT, ACT, and also specializes in trauma. Also as a personal preference of mine (and from personal experience), I try to always go to someone with a Psy.D or Ph.D as anything lower has never helped me, and I believe with cases as complex as ours, we need someone with higher training. 

I am rooting for you and remember you aren't alone. It can be hard to find a good therapist, but when you do, it is well worth it. I'm sorry this one didn't work out. Try not to look at it as a waste of time either - now you know what *not* to look for in a therapist! Best of luck, friend."

Remind yourself that you are safe, even if it may not feel like it. You are safe, friend. I'm so so sorry. 

If you're able - doing a DBT skill called TIPP may help convince your body that you're safe and remove it from the fight or flight. Taking a cold shower, or dipping your head in some cool water (or at least eyes and forehead), or a cold wet rag. I personally keep ice packs in the freezer to put on my eyes and forehead and neck when I need to calm down. Keeping oranges in the freezer have also helped.

BPD,flmv7xl,t3_fppx0e,1585298065.0,"I relate to this a lot. I usually just attributed it to growing up in the age of Toy Story where inanimate objects *do* talk and have feelings. I guess I never even really considered that others may not do this - especially with random ass things at the store. 

I know for me, it connects to the sense of abandonment we feel. Like I feel discarded, I don't want this object to feel the same way. That is usually how it manifests in myself. Now I wonder if others don't do this at all. 

I always assumed others did, but now that I think about it, I don't remember anyone really talking about this outside of the context of toys/Toy Story movies. 

If you find yourself buying a lot of unnecessary objects because of this - maybe watching the movie Sausage Party could help (its on Netflix or Amazon I believe). Although now that I think about it, that could complicate things on the other end of the spectrum. Hmph."

The hard thing is I still really really liked him, but I just couldn't cope with a relationship. If I went to his gym, I would probably still try to spend time with him because I did enjoy his company.

Also the stuff about trying to leave the same time as you/following you home - there could be a million other reasons why she is doing that. Maybe she has somewhere she needs to be right after, and maybe she was going to visit a friend or go to a store or get gas and your neighborhood had a shortcut. I won't deny that it is possible it was because of you, it is also possible that it was not.

I understand wanting to experience more people, but just make sure you're not destroying your relationship in doing so. 

Maybe try to figure out why exactly you want to experience another man so badly. Fear? Curiosity? Dissatisfaction? All feelings are valid - but just make sure your actions are for the right reasons. It's hard to earn back trust after something like this, so honestly you have to ask yourself if it would be worth the risk of losing your fiancee. 

I'm all about for doing want you feel is best for you, but it is also important to recognize the commitment you have already made in your relationship."
adhd_anxiety,fhicaqg,t1_fhhy6yx,1581621963.0,"Since it isnt on your paperwork - then you're fine. It is all in the documents - not what the website says. (My school's website is incorrect and terrible all the time). 

Talking with the coordinator can be difficult. I would suggest keeping mostly to your primary therapist and going to her to help problem-solve academic difficulties. Like I was having a hard time with a seminar of mine this last semester, and the DSS coordinator helped me think of ways to get through it (including her telling the prof that he NEEDS to give us a syllabus - especially since there was at least one other person in the class with accommodations as well). 

When it comes to disability services, it doesn't matter *when* you were diagnosed, just that you have been. There is a lot of stigma around it at our age though. Even the pharmacist gave me a bad look when I was picking up my Vyvanse. It took a week and a half to even get approved to take it because of my age. (They denied my psychiatrists form the first time, so she had to resend it). 

I will say though that accommodations are getting even stingier because of all the people trying to abuse the system - which my DSS coordinator told me. Like people trying to get approved for accommodations for the GRE, getting their kids into schools they aren't qualified for (cough cough Lori Loughlin). There is just a lot of abuse in the system, so I guess they just got to be on their toes, which makes it even more difficult for those of us who actually need the help. 

(Also I am super proud of you for still emailing your prof and using your extension)."

And your prof legally has to abide by your accommodations. I also would advice not asking in your email - just saying it. That's how I would do it bc then it's definite and they can't be wishy washy. 

I'd usually say ""hi prof. X, Im sorry for the late notice, but I am going to need to use an extension on my essay per my accommodations. (Then say when you think it will be done/how long your accommodations give you, or just say you'll talk with them after class depending on your situation."

Most people don't know the testing either and think you just go to a doc and say ""I can't focus"" and boom you get your meds. Not only are the meds hella regulated, but yeah there's tons of testing. But the general population doesn't know that.

In my ""to-go"" TIPP kit, I'd have those reusable ice packs and then also really strong mints or strong menthol cough drops. Remember a part of the skill is also intense exercise, so if you have the ability to take a break and just do a few sprints real quick, that could also work. Otherwise even just putting your hands in some ice water could help. If you have some place where you can keep things - maybe getting a mini cooler where you can put reusable ice packs could help too."
adhd_anxiety,fhhs5ym,t3_f3br2m,1581610688.0,"I always dismissed my ADHD as anxiety/depression. When I learned that hyperfocus was a symptom, that's when I realized it may be more, so I got tested in September and was diagnosed. I'm not sure what the process was like for your testing, but it would be pretty hard to get a false diagnosis with all the tests they do. The people telling you it's just anxiety probably are just looking at the stereotypes of ADHD or don't fully understand what it actually entails to have it.

Edit: Also - if you don't already have them, look into getting accommodations at your University. They made such a huge difference for me the last year and a half of school. I would get extensions on papers that made them much more bearable."

Tinder,fh8j5iv,t1_fh8hchy,1581360845.0,"The perception of Reddit among women could be totally different in your country/area. I just know a lot of my female friends - even though they know how much I love Reddit and how diverse it really is, still all have a negative connotation with it. Anyone who has actually been on it sees otherwise, but a lot of people haven't.

Also - I realized the word 'trick' in your mention of psychology tricks can be a flag. No woman is interested in being tricked - especially in actually meeting men that they have 'tricks' in mind. We have a straight-up risk of being harmed when meeting, so that could definitely be a flag.

Maybe just mentioning you're into psychology? Or if there are general tricks that fall under a certain category of psychology - mentioning that? Like that you love gaining insight into psychology, or body language, or just how the mind reacts to certain things? Just a thought.

Edit: Also - the negative connotation may only be in more liberal/urban areas. I don't know how it is perceived in more rural or conservative or mixed areas, so take that into account too."
Tinder,fh8ik9g,t1_fh8hawo,1581360484.0,Oh yeah - I didn't realize that. Some more natural pictures would definitely help. Seeing a genuine/candid smile makes me much more likely to swipe right for sure.

I think 'damn' would be better there. Also make sure to end the first paragraph with a period too to be consistent. 

Also - idk if your mention of Reddit is all that great. I've found that women here (assuming that is who you are looking for) have negative connotations with Reddit unless they themselves also go on it, so that may be hurting you, but it is harder to know with that one. This is coming from a female American perspective, so still do what you think is best."
CPTSD,fh2p1jy,t3_f1917f,1581258981.0,"I would definitely consider getting another opinion - but unfortunately, he has a point. I remember looking into becoming a religious sister myself a few years ago (was lightly discerning when I was 18-19) and after reading about others' experiences online, I realized it would be very hard for me to actually join an order due to my mental illness. Basically, if your symptoms could ever get in the way of you effectively doing your job as a priest, then that's a flag. They do take into account though the amount of time since your last flare of symptoms - but there is still also stigma around it. If you need regular therapy and medication to keep your symptoms in check, that would also make it difficult. 

I will say, however, that it is not impossible. During confession once, the priest told me about his struggle with depression. Another priest I was close to during college also struggled with it. It isn't impossible, but you would have to overcome many roadblocks. 

If you decide not to since it is such a long process, maybe becoming a deacon or something else that doesn't carry the same responsibilities? Also - the church needs strong laypeople, so if that is what you end up being, don't discredit yourself. You are as important to the church no matter what role you are. Everyone is working to further the message of Christ through your own faith and your works. You are important too."

Additionally, as someone who is pretty self aware of my BPD - it is still incredibly hard to stop it. Even if I'm aware of it, it is like being on autopilot. Therapy and DBT specifically are your best shots at reducing your behaviors associated with BPD because it straight up teaches you how to do things differently."

A thin flower petal is pretty vague, but I'll leave it to you and the guide to determine if stitches are needed (and if they are - or if there is any question of it - GO GET THEM. I can't emphasize that enough). Going off of my general knowledge/if this were me, I'd definitely make sure to flush it with a saline solution (anything sterile) to get any debris out. Then I'd use butterfly bandages to close it (to prevent infection and help with healing and bleeding). If it is a smaller gape, then steri-strips may also work but it sounds like a butterfly bandage would be best. Then put an antibiotic ointment on it and cover it with a 'hurt free' bandage - or if you are using just gauze or a large bandage - layer on that ointment really thick. Otherwise, when the blood/cut dries, it can get stuck to the bandage and when you change it it will rip off any healing progress.

Right now I'm trying to figure out what to do bc I have so my interests - but if music is your passion, that's a wife enough range of interest where you can have your work but still have your hobby after hours. 

Also - try to think of a future career as in ""what skills does your hobby provide you with that can be applied to multiple areas"" and develop those bc it can help get a job beyond your field too if need be. 

Don't major in something you're not at least a little passionate about. If you want to stick with engineering - music needs all sorts of help in that area. Engineering sound systems, lighting, stages, etc. Functional aesthetics. You have many options."

On the same note - I would suggest looking into seeing if there are any DBT groups near you. The skills are much more effectively taught in a group setting (but not impossible to learn on your own). My current DBT group is making me cry of gratefulness because working with the full workbook is so legitimate and fulfilling. Either way - I hope this helps! Sorry for my little tangent lol."

In the presentation, imagine you're just sharing this cool info with a buddy (or a lot of buddies at once). Even if it's boring as hell - pretend it's interesting, and it gets so much easier. 

Also what I usually do (I had accomodations but it could still work if you don't) is try to talk to the teacher beforehand and explain to them that you're really nervous and see if you can go first.
