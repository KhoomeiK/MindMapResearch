depression,fljx0r2,t3_fozmk5,1585228854.0,"i get what you mean, and i have a reason why! so when we get depressed, or experience some other strong and aggressive emotion (like the loss of a loved one, anxiety, etc.), our brain senses this! it triggers a response in us and out brain rapidly checks all of our systems, trying to find the issue, because surely, there must be one. when nothing turns up broken out brain things of our intestines, our big, confusing, and messy intestines. when out brain tells out body that something is wrong in the messy insides it activates something called the vagus nerve, and that nerve is one of the most complex in out bodies, and that activity is what you feel in your chest! because of this, scientists are learning how to use the vagus nerve to combat treatment resistant depression and PTSD!

It was a little scary only because I had class but otherwise it was fun, people said I was functioning normally, but that I looked a tad anxious. Would this count as full blown psychosis?

AnorexiaNervosa,fl3wphs,t3_fmebia,1584800356.0,"also, i would like to add, purging and restricting can be a factor if the white layer is only there when you wake up, like immediately upon waking. if itâ€™s only then, then yes, you relapsed yourself into this (i recommend a lip scrub for the mornings), but if it starts in the morning and wonâ€™t go away (if itâ€™s due to ED things it will) or if it showed up mid day, this can be extremely dangerous. again, i donâ€™t want to scare you, at all, i am in no way a medical professional, but iâ€™ve seen the gross white film on my lips and i know where it leads. also brush your tongue, it helps with the film in your mouth."
AnorexiaNervosa,fl3wfz5,t3_fmebia,1584800160.0,"iâ€™m not sure what itâ€™s called but itâ€™s due to severe dehydration or lack of oxygen in the blood. i know both of these things because i have asthma. if you have asthma youâ€™re in extreme distress and your lungs need help- GO TO URGENT CARE. if you arenâ€™t asthmatic and are breathing fine, you need liquid. now. get gatorade, the one packed with the sugar, the big one, and drink it slowly over the course of about an hour. i mean slowly, or else youâ€™ll pee it right out, if you notice the film going away after about half an hour of sipping, do the same thing again with another gatorade. mayne eat, if you cam. if you cannot keep the gatorade in you, either because you pee, vomit, or it comes out your butt- GO TO URGENT CARE, this means that you are fighting some type of illness or infection and you are losing the hydration battle, and you need immediate medical intervention. either you are severely dehydrated or your lungs suck (like mine), but either way, this is not healthy.  seek medical help. i dont mean to scare you but iâ€™ve had this happen to me on two occasions, and itâ€™s happened to my mom a few times too, and iâ€™ve seen how bad these things can get, and how quickly they get out of hand. you probably need IV fluids (no calories, itâ€™s saline solution), or oxygen therapy. either way, please look out for yourself. i urge you to try the gatorade, and if that doesnâ€™t work, please please please seek professional medical help. please pm me when you get this sorted out so i know youâ€™re okay."
