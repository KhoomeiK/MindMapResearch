Coronavirus,fmb56vr,t1_fmb2xkn,1585918629.0,"Well, I guess it‚Äôs a matter of looking at the other side of the fence. 

People see our low(er) numbers and assume we‚Äôre doing well, when our policies became very reactive and thumb twiddly. Singaporeans continued to crowd the malls and eat out at restaurants, going to ikea to have fun with the furniture etc. 

It was only until recently that the government decided to slightly revise their stance and encourage the use of masks, albeit reusable cloth ones that aren‚Äôt really that effective. (Before this, they were actively discouraging the use of masks through constant speeches/social media posts/advertisements, most likely due to the shortage. But Singaporeans being who they are, believed the government‚Äôs words and went about mask-less, parroting that wearing a mask was of no use). 

Our numbers are lower because our country is small, simple as that. With our significant number of vulnerable elderly, high population density and our general slowness and reluctance to change, it‚Äôs only going to get worse from here

There are many economic and social reasons for not implementing a full lockdown and raising the pandemic alert levels, I understand and respect the need for balance. But I fear we were not strict enough with our policies (stay home notice enforcement, banning of travellers from countries hugely affected by the outbreak, the constant reassurance by the government that daily life can go on) and it is too late now. :/

Hope all of you stay safe"

Ironically, Mikasa is so well-liked because she has many fanboys (who like her because she‚Äôs hot/cute etc. When talking about her strength and how she can beat Levi, they have to speak about it in terms of her potential, whereas there is actually solid evidence that Levi is a better soldier lol)

But it‚Äôs frustrating that just because girls like a character, it invalidates that character and guys start looking down on him/his supporters. As if fanboys are not the same, if not worse, considering how many of us don‚Äôt just look at how hot he is or his abs (equivalent to boobs to guys lol), but instead the character‚Äôs personality, motivations etc. It‚Äôs toxic, really."

People who watch the anime just think he‚Äôs a heartless titan killer who‚Äôs there to appeal to fangirls, lel. There are fangirls who only care about his looks, but I could care less about seeing his abs and arms and shit. 

Even manga readers are not exempt. They just find Levi boring even after all the subtle character development and reveals of his true personality - but I guess it‚Äôs precisely because these hints are subtle. People just refuse to look past his ‚Äòviolent tendencies‚Äô and worship Eren which is ironic because what he wants is hella violent, lol. It just frustrates me that people dropped him after the whole serum bowl, or even for the simple reason that they think he has no personality. Grrr"
