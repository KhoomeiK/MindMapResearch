Why have I spent the last 30 minutes looking down his post history and an additional 90 minutes (or the length of a soccer game for those who do not know) looking down his comment history? There is a man named Jordan Cambridge who lives in Dallas, Texas. He speaks like a child but lives an ordinary life. His posts comment on everyday things and also some unusual things. So who else is involved. What family does he have? We’ll take a look at his r/Showerthoughts post “The dog licked the baby’s head”. So he has a relationship with a baby, which means he is possibly a brother, I doubt he is a father since he speaks like a child. He also seems to have a pet dog, which he has took a photo of. The dog seems to be healthy and happy. He says there was a storm in Dallas but there are storms all the time so we cannot specify where in Dallas this man lives. There is not information on this man to know anything about him. He seems to be like Forrest Gump, if Forrest Gump did not go through any experiences which Forrest Gump went through. He seems to be a happy individual. But he hasn’t posted anything in almost a year, something is stopping him. What could it be? We may not know, and we may never know. He also seems to have a large following and has an r/AskJordan subreddit. He is quite the individual."
