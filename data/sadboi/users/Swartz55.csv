But, he said, since I was already at 0 HP, I wasn't raised as a thrall and instead just made another death save. Then our healer rezzed me, I crawled into the dragons mouth, yelled ""Bahamut's Ballsack"" and then cast Thunderwave with my highest spell slot and used my Channel Divinity to make it automatically deal max damage, blowing the dragons jaw off.
