he is my sol(sun), he brings warmth in my heart, he’s like a sunshine but it’s never possible for sol and luna to be together. the universe never destined the sun and moon to be together

“almost” is never enough, that is what hurts me.

i’m sorry i’m dramatic fuck him anyways. i love my current happy crush even tho the only happiness he’s giving me right now is his tweets

ps. and what i learned is, just because someone treats u special doesn’t mean you’re really special to them, sometimes i’m thinking, “did he just treat me like his walking diary?”, because he just threw me away like we never met (yeah long story short that’s where it all ended and that sht hurt), and now i envy those new people he’s close to like bruh that should be me. 

and if u think about it i think that’s the point of what i posted. the more special i am to my crush, the more i’m hurting. sorry i’m having trouble putting it into words again"

teenagers,fq69upg,t3_gh18vn,1589127401.0,"same. i got some good ol bunch of friends or acquaintances i talk to at school. im just cool around them, but they know nothing about my personal life, my problems, or whatever. i had an old group of friends, who’s good and very ideal, that i lost because of me being a dumb bitch who doesn’t wanna share some of my personal stories to them, maybe due to my trust issues or overthinking.

i feel happy at school but when i get home i feel lonely and empty since my inboxes are empty. when i text them they’re just sometimes plain cold then i realized that maybe they treat me like that person who they could talk to when their best buds are not around. all my socializing happens at school and not on the internet so basically i got 0 talkmates this quarantine, my whole life i never even experienced having a random phone call with a friend that lasts for hours. it’s like this every year/summer vacation, at first i thought it’s ok or normal but now i’m starting to feel lonely or abnormal, i feel absolutely depressed right now. this quarantine made me feel and realized some things, i didn’t made any good friends that i can really call a friend, and i got bad social skills since i didn’t know how to make a solid friendship with anyone. at least i got a lesson learned. and i hope, i’m really hoping, that i could make new friends again or reunite with my old ones and this time i hope i could make proper and healthy bonds with them.

edit: sorry this was pretty long, i’ve never talked about this matter lately. but i don’t feel super lonely now that i knew i’m not the only one who’s struggling with this."

let’s just be honest, physical looks really matters, and if u don’t have it, all unfortunate things follow; you’re not respected, you’re judged, you’re bullied, lesser chance of someone liking you, basically every shit. and the worst thing is u start to beat yourself up hate yourself and now u don’t have your self esteem. that’s me. yeah, pretty girls always win the game

Bible,fome12b,t1_foma8nx,1587886648.0,"sorry i wasn’t clear. i don’t believe much in the bible, to be honest, most people knows it’s manmade, even the faithful ones, and i’m one of them. but that doesn’t mean i don’t believe in God, i still read it for motivation and its inspirational words. even to the statues and sculptures made by man that’s said that they are God, no, they’re not real. i don’t really like religion much. but i’m still a Christian, “Christ”ian, so i believe on God itself, on Christ. not on the bible, not on the rituals/beliefs people on my religion does. i communicate and worship with other people who also believes in Christ but not the same religion as mine. i go to Catholic churches even i’m a Christian.

there are so many religions out there who believes in Yahweh/Jesus, so basically we’re only worshipping one God yet we’re separated by our rituals and beliefs.

you don’t always need evidences. you don’t always need proofs. sometimes, you just do an act of faith. and yes, you can’t see it with your own eyes, hear it with ur ears, but you’ll feel it. i’ve been there.

on the other hand, being an atheist means “you believe in no god, not even one”, so you don’t say “you’re an atheist to other gods”, my dear brother


i don’t know if i met other atheists tho, my point is i never talked about religion to an atheist, sorry for not clarifying that"

plus, you expect Gods to talk back on your prayers??? what

i never met some kind of person like you who i think don’t believe some gods are not real so idk what to say, but i respect whatever your faith or religion is"

i’m naturally extroverted. i’m pretty loud at school. tho i’m a little awkward especially with people i ain’t close/comfortable with. i’m just really scared/hate talking thru the internet :("

i don’t really remember how i made friends exactly, i just remove the shyness i feel when i talk to people. and you’ve got a lot to talk about with others since you’re just starting to get to know them.

as an older high school kid, as long as freshman kids are kind and respectful, all the higher grades would prolly like them, higher grades aren’t kinda scary (some do tho they won’t really bother u if u dont bother them). i made acquaintances/friends with some older ppl in school and i feel like they’re just the same age as be bc they’re just chill, cool and nice. just look as them like they’re freshmen too because there’s really no significant difference between you and them higher grades."

ok i’m so sorry i shared this & it’s pretty long lol. so my point is, it looks like people aren’t just comfortable around me and they’re being awkward because i’m really awkward at them most of the times too. and it’s hard to change my awkward image in their mind haha. :(

SkincareAddiction,flanxng,t1_flakc6f,1584987621.0,"hmm, but i don’t think HA alone will be enough because based on what i’ve researched it really just acts as a moisturizer.. but i guess i’d combine it with other aha/bha, is it gonna be okay? thanks for the tip!"
SkincareAddiction,fl9w2se,t3_fnjzua,1584970818.0,try to use retinoids!
SkincareAddiction,fl9vvne,t3_fnjzwm,1584970671.0,"yes it’s normal especially after using it for the first time, but you use tret 0.1% like EVERY single night? that’s too much. u should prolly use it twice a week first, to minimize your irritation.

check out the r/tretinoin sub, there are a lot of helpful posts and advices there"
beautytalkph,fl0ybc7,t3_flqrtj,1584718319.0,"they’re almost similar to each other.. tretinoin is anti acne and anti aging at the same time. aha are great at removing blackheads and whiteheads, and if you’re experiencing redness from tret because it’s said to be anti inflammatory (based on my research). so they can both be used together, but tretinoin is better, so you can use tret alone rather than aha alone :))"
loner,fjd6uw3,t3_f3pnht,1583247016.0,"i have “friends” but i don’t have best friends. i have these “main” friends who i’m always with when im at school, but they both have a whole different group of friends or their main friends so i’m basically just friend A. i’m a loner when they’re with their main friends.

well, since i started high school i never got a constant friend, not even a single one. i always had a new friend or set of friends every school year. it’s fun being with them especially at first, like really. it’s a great experience to have those type of friends whom u can laugh, joke, talk, share problems and secrets with. it’s fun. but now i learned that some peeps are temporary, and it sucks when you’re not close to them anymore due to some reasons. idk maybe im just that dumb that i didn’t cherish friendships more, or maybe im just plain boring.

i dont wanna be a loner, i’m not some strange or introverted dude, but yeah idk, i cant control it. yeah it sucks to be with the wrong people who puts u down or brings u negativity. so i think kind of i appreciate being alone bc it’s kind of peaceful, but it’s just so fucking lonely sometimes i get depressed. i miss having people who i could talk to comfortably and joyfully. i just wish i get to meet good genuine people that’ll be with me for life. but at this point maybe im just better off alone now, stick with my friends that have other best friends than me."

tretinoin,fglk8tr,t1_fgivjcd,1580901842.0,"so is it still fine to use a light moisturizer even if it does not moisturize enough, as long as u put vaseline on top of it? will vaseline increase it’s strength, or what?"

tretinoin,fgiijsu,t1_fgig0mc,1580822699.0,well.. what can i use for these hyperpigmentations then?
tretinoin,fgf7vch,t1_fgcdt1u,1580729099.0,"will do, thanks.. side question: did your face get dry after having facial extraction? it’s my 1st time so yeah haha and my face is reallyyy dry & flaky now even if i skipped the adapalene"
SkincareAddiction,fg7zwqq,t1_fg6s4lz,1580605810.0,"sorry i didn’t clarify on this post that the main reason i stopped tret is that i didn’t tolerate it well and my face was kind of much more harmed more than good due to all the irritation so i switched to a less irritating one haha. but tret did kind of worked on the pimples i get, but it turns it into a mark/hyperpigmentation. it didnt do much on the comedones, marks, and my face was never been hydrated and calm ever since i used it..

i did some research tho, that adapalene has the same strength as tret but it is less irritating, but idk"
tretinoin,fg6a4qr,t1_fg69iqn,1580561032.0,"ohh, thank u thank u!! did you purge when you switched to adapalene?"
SkincareAddiction,fg651ht,t3_en70je,1580553993.0,"same thing happened to me! been on tret 0.05 cream for almost a year and all i had was pimple marks, dryness, comedones, redness, etc. pimples did improved, a little. but it did not give me clear skin. plus my older derma NEVER made me use sunscreen and moisturizer while on tret!! so i moved to a new one and she prescribed me bp gel 5% and adapalene gel 0.1%. i will use adapalene for the first time maybe tonight or tomorrow evening.

i really kind of hated tret huhu i think it ruined my skin more than giving it more improvements.

i just wish i can finally get clear skin like you aaa huhu

p.s. did u still had a bad purge after switching?"
Dermatillomania,fg64qbg,t3_evfslm,1580553529.0,"hello, do you get a purge with adapalene? i was using tretinoin 0.05 for over a year & it didn’t work for me :< so i moved to a new derma and prescribed me bp gel 5% and adapalene gel 0.1% instead. ugh i hope this one works now. :(("

tretinoin,femeyl0,t1_felbmv5,1579251988.0,"my experience on tret was meh, i used it for almost 1 year, my face improved tho but it’s super dry, red and my pores are big and visible and still kept getting pimples and painful cystic acne. my older derm doesn’t make me use any moisturizer or sunscreen. so i moved to a new one which prescribed me bp 5% gel instead. can’t really judge my face yet since i’m just using it for like 4 days but i can tell that the dryness and redness isn’t that bad now! tho i’m having small bumps. hoping that bp would really be my holy grail. 🤞🏻🤞🏻"
