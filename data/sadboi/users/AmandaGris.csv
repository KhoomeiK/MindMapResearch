AskLiteraryStudies,fl2hogp,t1_fkw9sfo,1584751271.0,"Thank you for the suggestion! Right now I’m only focusing on Miss Lonelyhearts, but I’m sure it’s a lens that could be applied to innumerable books. I guess you phrased my question better than I did in the OP! I’m looking for suggestions on which theoretical backgrounds could come in handy. Right now I’m using a more cultural studies-based approach to toxic masculinity. 

I mentioned in a comment below that one scene in particular that got me thinking about this was one in which men around Miss L casually make rape jokes and no one is bothered but the protagonist, amongst other details in the text."

AskLiteraryStudies,fl2h59l,t1_fkxjdq4,1584750914.0,"I haven’t read A Separate Peace since high school, but from what I remember and from what you have written, this sounds like a great reading you’re doing. I envy your students! 

I recently read Miss Lonelyhearts & The Day of the Locust for grad school, and now that I’m in a forced quarantine I’m taking the free time to look back on the books I have read so far this semester to start looking for connections and things I might have missed. As I was reading Lonelyhearts, I was struck by how the men around the protagonist behave, making rape jokes, for example, and how Miss L recoils from that behavior. That also connects to the fact that we never learn Miss L’s real name, and that although West refers to him with male pronouns throughout, we never learn his “male” name. He filters himself through a female alter ego. 

Religion is the most typical approach people read Miss Lonelyhearts from. I wanted to try to find a different way into it for a few reasons beyond creativity! In the few semesters I’ve been in so far, I’ve realized I am sorely lacking in Catholic/Christian religious background reading. And, my primary interests are gender and feminist theory, so as I approach thesis time, I’m trying to hone that lens with most things I read. 

Sorry I took some time in responding, and for any mistakes; I’m on mobile."

But, as my school takes next week off to figure out the next move, and spending a lot more time at home, this could be a good distraction. My personal interests are mostly in gender theory, but I’d love to widen my range!"

I think I’ll test out the Niacinamide only on my cheeks for a few days, see what posi or neg effects it has. Same with the mud masks, although they do leave my cheeks feeling soft for at least a day or so. 

I have at least been using a moisturizing primer with SPF on the days I wear makeup, so it’s an AM step!"
