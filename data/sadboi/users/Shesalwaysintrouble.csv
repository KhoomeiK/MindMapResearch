I am a survivor of rape and molestation. It occurred at the age of 3. I remember what the room looked like when it was happening, some of the conversation, and what he said to lure me in. 

Would that mean I'm missing the ability to block out trauma? 

These type of incidents seem to repeat themselves in my life. Could it be because of the lack of that ability?"

My pervert ex boss, and his pervert supervisor would say that when my perverted male coworkers would do stupid perverted shit. One time this young guys (21) on our team was fed up with working late hours. He started slamming the keys on his key board out of frustration. He continued to do it and no one said anything. It scared the shit out of me. I asked my boss to please ask him to stop. He responded,""Boys, will be boys."" I was the only female in that department and we would sometimes work until 3AM.

AskReddit,ey2aq59,t3_cv74en,1566732878.0,"I use to feel safe walking my beach at night and laying under the trees to take a nap by the shore. Friends and I would camp there regularly and we would have a blast.

One night, my then boyfriend decided we should invite a few more people that he was close too. I knew these guys were drama. Not really the guys, but the girlfriends. Anyway, I was in love so my dumb ass went along with it. 

Everyone came, we were having a great time laughing, a little drinking, and thought, ""Man I was wrong about these girls. Glad he invited them."" 

Spoke to soon.

I got tired, so I settled into my sleeping bag ready for bed. 5 minutes later I get woken up by screaming. 

It was her. One of the girlfriends was contorting on the ground mumbling about God and screaming. Possessed. Idk if she was or not, but then this other girl that he invited starts going nuts and gets on the ground contorts, mumbles, starts screaming and all that good shit. 

Me and my friends are there silent, scared shitless. My boyfriend and the girls boyfriends go over them and start mumbling prayers and whatever. Meanwhile, I'm scared and pissed the fuck off because everything was perfect until this shit happened. Literally, camped there millions of times. BUT THE ONE FUCKING TIME WE INVITE THESE CHICKS IT BECOMES A GOD DAMN DEMONIC PLAYGROUND. 

Anyway, it was traumatizing. I don't fuck with this shit. So I didn't know what to think. Apparently the girl is a portal and the other girl is just easy prey for demons. I couldn't believe their explanation. We all stayed up until sunrise on the beach with the first girl who's a portal and her boyfriend watching him pray over her. The other girl ended up scaring the other campers a few feet from us and got punched in the head. That knocked the demon out of her cause she was fucking fine after that. 

Anyway, after this shit show I was hesitant to walk through my beach at night, camp there, or nap there.

I learned a lot from this experience though, keep my circle to a trust worthy few and when you love certain experiences only share it with those you trust and want to enjoy it entirely with. People tend to ruin shit.

Edit: Both girls were known in our dorm to have these ""possessed"" situations. It happened like 3 - times. In different areas."

It sucks that it took that many, but at least they know now that I really am suffering. All. The. Time.

The crazy part is, it was my cousin too. He was like 10 and I was 3. Can you believe that his parents actually got him a job to work in the same department as me? Even though they know what he did to me? So we live and grew up next to one another and they go and put him in the same department because his mom was a big shot with the company. I can understand what you mean by it ruining you... I feel so beaten and ripped up. I hope one day I find something to keep me up. I try to be a good person and hope that will be enough. However, it just seems to make ppl think im a push over. Thank you for the support. I am already in awe of everyone who responded."
depression,eq6wzsw,t1_eq6l3jk,1559836823.0,"Thank you for the kind words. My support system is my immediate family. I have a hard time accepting that my parents failed to protect me. My mom has suffered through trauma as well, and I don't like blaming them. You see, it was my cousin who lives next door that molested me. (Her only brothers, onoy son) He too was just a kid. I find myself forgiving everyone but hating myself.

I tried meds. I had a doctor who put me on anything whenever the last med stopped working. I hate them because once they don't work everything comes flooding back like a train wreck. It's like the meds allowed me to numb my feelings for awhile and when they stop my emotions are just too much to handle.

I use to have hobbies, when I have my ""ups"" meaning when i'm feeling positive... but lately i've got nothing. I also just got the word from my doctor that I have a life time illness. So, literally I keep getting more and more broken."
