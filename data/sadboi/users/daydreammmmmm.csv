BPD,fjzd73c,t1_fjzcsuu,1583716966.0,"Also, thank you for responding 💗"
BPD,fjzd66j,t1_fjzcsuu,1583716949.0,"What do you think the answer is? For me, suicide isn’t currently an option, so I am trying to figure out another way to keep going. Do you have any solutions?"
BPD,fjzd2j0,t1_fjzci7f,1583716880.0,I appreciate the positivity. What do you think about to keep going? How do you find that positive energy?
BPDsupport,fjwk281,t3_ff5qb4,1583640084.0,yeah. sometimes i think it’s a bunch of bullshit.
BPD,fjvoc87,t1_fjvbkit,1583629249.0,this is exactly how I feel. I also feel like he forced this diagnosis on me in order to control me and take away my autonomy and allow him to assert dominance and always be right in every situation.
BPDmemes,fjpkc4h,t3_fen5y8,1583553124.0,I usually just drink coffee only til 5pm every day. I am trying to change this. i wish you all the best
BPD,fad87po,t1_facxxm6,1575959070.0,"well that got confusing! lol. Anyway, yes he is aware of everything in this post, and we’ve discussed it at length. He’s definitely not okay with emotional affairs (and neither am I really, even if they’re seemingly “harmless”). I think the real issue though is the dishonesty. I need to figure how to be brutally honest even when my shame level is at 100. :("
BPD,facteo0,t1_facr76w,1575946598.0,Well I greatly appreciate your response. Have a wonderful night.
BPD,facq8x1,t1_facnycz,1575944570.0,Thank you for saying that. I really really needed to hear that today. You are very kind.
BPD,facnfps,t1_facmnau,1575942975.0,"I’m not sure I’m following. Yes, I hate myself so much. I despise myself for what I’ve done. I understand how wrong my behavior is. Can you help me understand what you were trying to say? Thank you for taking the time to read this and for replying."
BPD,fac7ubn,t3_e8htnl,1575934905.0,"Dr. Fox is great! I’ve learned a ton from his videos. 

For a first hand perspective (not a clinician) check out RecoveryMum’s youtube channel. She’s incredibly insightful and refreshingly honest, and I learn a lot from hearing her perspective and how she’s dealt with the disorder. Obviously it’s not the same as a therapist, but she’s very self aware and has done her homework on the condition."
BPD,fac6y1x,t3_e8eqvz,1575934506.0,I’m also a recovering addict with BPD. A truly awful combo. There are a bunch of us out there. Am here to chat if you need support or anything! Wishing you the best!
