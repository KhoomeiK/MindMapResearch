housesitting,ffzhl1h,t1_ffze4eb,1580379511.0,Thanks. Definitely a lot to think about. I can always live my cat at my parents.
BPD,fdjiafy,t3_e7zw34,1578472066.0,Ive realised for a few years now that I have a problem with FP attachments. And they are attachmwnts. Now I am full aware of me slowly attaching. I never want to have a FP like that again. I want to be independent and free. FP is the opposite of that. I want to have proper friendships.

transhumanism,f6ba4ui,t3_dqjgvp,1572770886.0,"Read your paper. Quite an interesting summary. 

Definitely got me thinking about the data needed to transfer across to be a 'whole' person. What is a person's whole self?? Yes there is basic mechanism functions and ego. But there is more. Much we have not explored enough to fully understand. Tolle is a great source to begin this discovery.
It also got me thinking. Should an individual human consious live forever? Would we eventually turn into to ghosts in our digital minds? Would all joy be eventually taken from us? Or would we have enough time to all become enlightened persons? 
What happens to you when you live forever??"
