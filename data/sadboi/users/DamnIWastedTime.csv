I've currently learned that I don't want equality amoung genders as I'm a clinical narcissist. I want what suits me and honestly you're anger is turning me on.

I believe as much as he was scared he stood up to that bully and came out on top. In response to your comment about soy, unfortunately I'm allergic. I would love to endulge but I'm a sick boy if I eat it.
And I've tried to enjoy fighting things smaller than me but there's no challenge so I've resorted to sarcastic babbling and wasting their time.
Remember kids, it's just the internet and I'm most likely 65 and very lonely. But luckily I'm a sexy mf who just dripping in SWA-Goo. Also RIP HARAMBE

pussypassdenied,fdo447g,t1_fdo0w0x,1578598543.0,"Gender isn't the focus, it's equality. It makes us happy to see everyone treated with the same respect and standards. Anyone who hits someone should expect retaliation. Justice should be served without gender bias. Unfortunately it's not the case as men receive almost double the time in sentencing than women for the same crimes. The fact that society at the moment is worshipping women also adds to reasoning why we enjoy the content.
It's a release, a pass time that helps re-adjust our perspective to a healthier one. One that allows us to see that there is some fairness still in the world.
Plus I can't help but to fucking love seeing someone's arrogance and hubris get them into trouble. It's so satisfying."
AskReddit,fderp3g,t3_ekzqva,1578345204.0,Honestly I would be extremely disappointed she decided to exploit herself for money. It would be sad to see her pursuing money rather than her dreams. If her dream was to be an object of men and women's list then I failed as a parent.

relationships,fdeq4bx,t3_ekztnn,1578344271.0,You could be honest about how you feel and talk to him about it. Don't attack but go into the conversation seeking understanding. If you can't find trust then find a new relationship.
xboxone,fdepgvs,t1_fdep699,1578343888.0,Yeah only caveat but if you're always online then it doesn't make too much of a difference. And you can always switch back in case of an internet outrage but you are limited to only a handful of changes per year

depression,fbcyr6d,t3_ecb4lx,1576738801.0,"I get this sometimes, my head from a young age was convinced I was the source of my suffering. I'd say the real feeling behind this is that of ""I wish I could exist without myself"". Eventually I found this to be me hating my ego continually beating me up and convincing me I was *insert whatever insult you can think of or character attack* worthless or worse a burden. My own brain saw me as the threat. Truly mind fucking.
As much as I don't relate 100% currently I remember each day I wanted to leave this fucking earth, I'm surprised to this day I'm still kicking."
MensRights,fb9mvu2,t1_fb9g57k,1576643000.0,The reasoning behind their viewpoints are always weak and that's if they've taken the time to think about this shit. Hopefully through time we can make the necessary changes. Any amount of time is too long but that's life I suppose.
MensRights,fb96s0z,t3_ebzdzy,1576630814.0,The conversations I've had around this topic have left me sad and frustrated every time.

BlackPeopleTwitter,f9rviqt,t3_e6j8ga,1575581883.0,Yes fuck them because they're white! Or because they're successful in a business only possible by (mostly white) beuracrats having passed legislation allowing for such businesses to exist? Or is it because in times of change we have those who still suffer the consequences of the past? Or is it just plain hate? My best friend dies due to distracted driving and I'm supposed to hate everyone who's survived on the road? Or the cell phone companies who have created the devices we hold so near and dear to us?

I kind of struggle with image but when i put that energy into becoming better at something it takes my mind away from that. I feel more confident just by adding a workout and learning a new hobby or skill.
JordanPeterson,f4juugj,t3_dkqbmq,1571626723.0,"Advice won't fix it and neither can you. I'm living the same life and my partner is amazing but she can't help. Advice doesn't help either because I don't want to change. I hate the life I live but the fear of change keeps me here. I believe each person changes at their own pace and for their own reasons. Unfortunately it seems his battle is his own and you have to keep yourself from falling during this time. Whether you go or stay is your choice but regardless do what you need to to stay sane and be there for him if you choose. Expectations that are small and build up can potentially help him build enough courage to fight but that's the best I got for ya.
To add on, I'd say don't focus on how he meets these expectations, that's for him to figure out, but do maintain them. Or else you risk giving him the impression you've given up. I know it's hard to expect things from mentally unwell people but trust me when everyone started to accommodate me, I felt worse lol."
