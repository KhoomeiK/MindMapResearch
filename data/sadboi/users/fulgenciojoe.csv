AskWomen,fnh1f1b,t3_g1oas2,1586952187.0,It was quite a huge blow to me. I always used to preach about this passionate love and how I never saw couples that were so madly in love with each other as I thought they should be. Then one day my little brother told me that lust and love are two different things. I was baffled to say the least. After that I spent a lot of time teaching myself out of this trauma-bonding that had pretty much guided everything I ever did in terms of ‚Äùlove‚Äù. Today I am thankfully in a relationship with a beautiful man (inside out) who respects me and I can honestly say that all the needless drama is out of the picture and I‚Äôve never been happier.

I know it‚Äôs a bummer but healing is a long process. It can take years and there can be relapses and there will be dark periods of time. I think you have to make your peace with that if you have decided to stick with your gf through this. Just remember that people can‚Äôt hide behind diagnoses, if they hurt others it‚Äôs still hurtful if you blurt out ‚ÄùI have PTSD!!!‚Äù in the end.

Believe me, I know. I also suffer from PTSD and I can only imagine the hell it has put my boyfriend in sometimes. 

It sounds like your gf should definitely think about how she is making you feel with this behaviour. Does she know all the things that has caused her complex PTSD? For me the same kind of behaviour stems from learning it from my father but the thing that triggers it is when I get scared. I fear abandonment like plague. If my boyfriend leaves the house I can spend hours and hours panicking and then I take it out on him and after that it‚Äôs just chaos all around. Is your gf aware of these triggers and the behaviour it creates in her? Usually these things come up in therapy but it seems like she hasn‚Äôt quite grasped them yet. Maybe if you both sat down when things are good and calm and try to make a list of all the possible triggers and she could try to see what sort of reactions they cause in her?

This is not a ‚Äùone-size fits all‚Äù kind of solution but I find that it suits me best when my bf honestly tells me how he is feeling and how I am making him feel. That way I don‚Äôt get a free pass for all my destructive reactions and I actually have to reflect the other persons feelings as well. Best way to do this is obviously in a calm manner and trying to de-escalate the situation and soothe your gf reacting to an emotional flashback.

BPD,erek7eq,t3_c1nuqy,1560786151.0,"First of all, I hope he is aware of your BPD and you have been honest with him about the severity of it? 

For me the best thing has obviously been the fact that I recognize my BPD, the situations that make me split and trying to control my emotions by trying to reason with my brain (not always succeeding ofc). Lately every time I feel a wave of jealousy or insecurity arise I tell myself ‚ÄùI trust my boyfriend‚Äù, ‚ÄùI am lovable‚Äù or other kinds of affirmations to try and calm myself down. Don‚Äôt let your expectations of your BPD drag yourself down when you guys haven‚Äôt even moved in together yet. When you are aware of your BPD and the situations it causes it‚Äôs already an excellent start. Also, honesty goes a long way. Just tell your boyfriend whenever you are feeling jealous and try to talk about the things that are causing it. 

Hope this rambling makes sense, I wish you all the best!"
