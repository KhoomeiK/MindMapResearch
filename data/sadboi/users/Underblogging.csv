greysanatomy,fkl70rz,t3_fiqr5l,1584299876.0,"Something broke in me maybe about three Amelia storylines ago. 

Now I have zero emotional investment in her character and this has made Grey’s anatomy way less frustrating to watch. 

But... yes this was cute!"

greysanatomy,fjn0gp2,t1_fjn0av4,1583493050.0,And he did it with a letter?? What! The more I think about this episode the less sense it makes.
greysanatomy,fjn02wg,t1_fjmzoic,1583492546.0,"Yep. Couldn’t have picked a worse send off. The whole episode, I felt so insulted - like you really think a few flashbacks is gonna cut it?

It’s going to take a bit more than that for this to make sense."

htgawm,fig2vns,t1_fiewwte,1582395538.0,At least she admits she isn’t likeable. I think the only reason I haven’t thrown my laptop at the wall in frustration and quit this show is because every character admits to their stupidities and crappy behaviour.

depression,ews1b3c,t3_cpidz8,1565718158.0,"This is my first time on this sub and this resonates with me - hard. 

I often catch myself saying ""I want to go home"" out loud a lot. It is like an involuntary habit I've picked up that I do in times of high stress or despair. I have said it even when I am home and have never really understood why I say it or even when I started saying it. I think this is the reason why - yikes. Thanks for this!"
