mentalhealth,fm3eslw,t1_fm3eor9,1585721098.0,"Also (OH MY GOD I am writing way too many messages), I just really wanted to say good for you for taking this shit into your own hands and advocating for yourself. I think learning how to do that has been one of the most valuable things I've learned in my life. You are doing SO GREAT by talking to professionals and getting what you need. YAY YOU. :) I really wish everyone would do that."
mentalhealth,fm3eor9,t1_fm3ekaa,1585720998.0,"But yes, if you ARE taking it for sleep, and it DOES happen to make you drowsy, I would recommend taking it as close to bedtime as possible. I don't like to drink a bunch of water AFTER brushing my teeth, so I would take the Seroquel and then brush my teeth promptly and then get into bed. If I was taking my sweet time, sometimes the Seroquel would start kicking in while I was brushing my teeth and it took me like 3x longer to finish, lol."
mentalhealth,fm3ekaa,t1_fltval3,1585720878.0,"Maybe 20 minutes? The tough thing for me is that I am always still VVVEEERRRYYY drowsy in the morning and it feels like it takes forever for the haze to wear off. HUGE CAVEAT THOUGH (which I wish I could comment on literally every post on this sub)-- everyone reacts differently to psych meds. How they feel for me may not be how they feel for you. Like I said before, they were originally prescribed to me as an antidepressant med supplement, and I was meant to take them during the day. That means that some people must be able to tolerate Seroquel during the day and not have the intense drowsiness that I do. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT! <3 And we all get to have lots of fun because the only way you can find out what works for you is spending lots of time trying different things! ;)"

mentalhealth,flt9b96,t3_fqwwwd,1585463623.0,"ALSO, just because a parent thinks you’re “fine” does not mean that you’re actually fine. You are the only person who knows what is going on inside of you. People who don’t have personal experience with mental illness have NO IDEA what it feels like/“looks like” to actually be dealing with these things. My mom had the “shrug it off” approach my whole childhood, meanwhile I was suffering with diagnoses that I would t be able to get until I was an adult an out of that environment."
mentalhealth,flt96j6,t3_fqwwwd,1585463488.0,I use quetiapine to sleep. It knocks me the FUCK OUT. I was originally subscribed it as a supplement to other depression meds but couldn’t take it as an ongoing regular med because of how drowsy it made me. I do not have any “psychotic” issues whatsoever. I have depression/anxiety and no BPD or bipolar. It was merely supposed to help boost my depression meds. People take different meds for different reasons and it’s 100% about finding the right balance for your personal chemistry and not about what words some antiquated classification system puts on the bottle.
hsp,fl8m86a,t3_fn149h,1584926946.0,"YES. I completely relate. I have such a hard time taking out the trash.

mentalhealth,ffroy10,t1_ffq0cdl,1580162595.0,"That being said, it is so, so completely normal and appropriate to have feelings of resentment and anger towards a diagnosis. Of course it sucks to have something extra you have to deal with that other people may not. Completely. But, you can either work towards accepting it or continue to hold onto the resentment. All bodies and brains are different and have issues that other people don’t have."
mentalhealth,ffroovm,t1_ffq0cdl,1580162439.0,"I think I understand what you’re saying about giving up— like if you choose to accept a diagnosis that that means you can’t do anything about it and it is what it is, maybe? That’s definitely not the approach I take. You can (and I think, should!) still absolutely do something about it. As far as anxiety, for me it’s about both accepting that it is a part of me, AND working really hard to manage it as much as possible so that it isn’t getting in my way. I hope that makes sense."
mentalhealth,ffk25d2,t1_ffjr4nu,1580013489.0,"Holla. That’s the first thing I thought when I read this. It’s all about leaning how to coexist peacefully WITH it. Trying to “get rid of it” is not only an inaccurate way to look at it, but also not the most compassionate stance to have towards yourself."

GriefSupport,et6apwb,t3_ca2pqd,1562508421.0,Thank you for sharing. This month is the anniversary of losing my dad as well and it’s weighing heavy on me. We all should be proud of the strength and resilience it takes to push through these unbelievably difficult times.
LosAngeles,et6ad0i,t1_et59ydb,1562508167.0,YES. This is what I keep thinking about! Also I have a tiny ass apartment and barely have enough room for the basic non-emergency shit I need.
AlAnon,et36lgx,t3_c9obwg,1562428720.0,"I SUPER resonate with this. If it's any comfort, in my experience, this issue becomes less pervasive as you get older. College drinking culture in particular is so strong and is continually being reenforced by the media.   


I also don't drink and never have after growing up with two alcoholic parents. Both high school and college were really difficult for me socially because of that. I consider myself a fun, outgoing person and I enjoy all non-drinking-related aspects of hanging out with friends/going to parties, but people always saw me as such a ""wet blanket"" (what weird ass idiom btw) and buzzkill with my alcohol aversion. in high school I simply stopped getting invited to parties and lost a few friends when I tried making ultimatums about how they needed to choose drinking OR friendship with me. We all know how that shit turns out! In college it was much worse because drinking and drinking to get drunk seems to be such an ""important"" part of what people perceive as the ""college experience."" I definitely felt a strong need to control others and asked friends that I'd made not to drink around me. Again, as I'm sure many people can relate, this pretty much never went well. I would get SO hurt and take it super personally when people would drink around me after I had asked them not to, as you mentioned you've experienced. They seemed so annoyed with me and I felt like I was never going to be able to have close friends or a social life.   


With age and perspective from hella therapy that I wish I could give to my college-age self, I now know that it wasn't personal and that good ol' Alanon teaches us that we can't control others and that it's only going to bring ourselves pain if we try to do so. I definitely thought that if I explained to close friends WHY I don't drink and WHY I hate being around it so much that they would be so sympathetic and compassionate about it that they would change their behavior. The thing is, it's impossible for them to truly understand what it's like to grow up with alcoholic/substance-abusing parents and the chaos and pain that brings to your childhood if they haven't experienced it themselves. I learned that other people's desires to fit in, have ""fun,"" and participate in a ""real college experience"" to the fullest were always going to trump my feeble pleas. That was about them and their journeys and their life experiences, which they were much more focused on. Fortunately now that I'm many years out of college, I find myself in situations like this MUCH less. I have much more freedom to pick the people I bring close to me, and many people seem to become less obsessed with drinking to get drunk as they age.   


The thing that helped me the most when I was still in school was to immerse myself in other types of social activities that didn't involve drinking-- clubs/groups/organizations, volunteering, outside of class activities related to my major, etc. That way I could still be my fun, outgoing self in a social environment, but the purpose of meeting up with people was not to get drunk. This gave me such a rich and diverse experience and I wish I had started doing this earlier in school.   


Still, there were inevitably times that I went to friends' parties and felt extremely disrespected by other people regarding my drinking abstinence. SO many times friends insistently pressured me to just ""try a little bit""/""have a little sip to see if you like it,"" etc, totally missing the point of why I wasn't drinking, and like it was a game to win me over if they asked enough times (and these were people who I 100% had explained my parents' alcoholism to). One time a college boyfriend (who also knew about why I didn't drink) went to go get me some cranberry juice and poured a little beer into it without my knowledge, I assume thinking that it would be funny. When I took a sip and immediately spit it out, I was so angry at him and I felt sooooooooo disrespected. Ugh, he was such a piece of shit. Anyway, I look back on these memories with sadness that my college-age self had to go through these things, but I no longer feel angry at these friends (well, maybe the ex-bf, lol) because I know that this behavior had nothing to do with them devaluing my experiences and everything to do with their own relationships with alcohol.   


This kind of turned into a novel, but I hope it's helpful to read. I felt SO fucking alone then and SO hurt and discouraged. If you can, try to remember that this is about them and their stories about and relationship with alcohol and that hearing about your childhood may be like speaking in a foreign language to them. I hope so much that you can find people with similar values as others have suggested. You can't stop these friends/""friends"" from their behavior, but you can put yourself in other types of situations with different types of people. I would also HIGHLY recommend, if possible, to get into therapy/counseling. Most colleges have on-campus programs where you can see someone either for free or for a very low cost. Being able to work through and take a look at that trauma in a safe space can really help with these friendships and social relationships you mentioned.   


Sending love your way! You can do this!"
