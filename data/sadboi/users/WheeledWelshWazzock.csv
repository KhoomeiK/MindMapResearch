SuicideWatch,foadx3u,t3_g332vs,1587645087.0,"I'm 38, being disabled and a wheelchair user, I felt that living with my parents was my only option and spent most of my time alone and being introverted loved it.

But I moved out 6 years ago and my anxiety and depression has gotten worse, with family deaths, getting cancer, tinnitus and pain from my disability. I'm alone with my self destructive thoughts, my day to day life is a never ending groundhog Day which has only got worse since the quarantine even thinking of getting a cat for some company.

I'm on anti depressants which help to an extent but I realise that living with my parents gave me someone to talk to and distracted me from my problems.

All I'm saying is living alone isn't as heavenly as it seems."
ForeverAlone,fo40irk,t3_g5jofc,1587496104.0,"I'm 38m, ive been alone for most of my life, I cannot see that changing anytime soon especially as im disabled and a wheelchair user, who's been rejected and friendzoned so many times, I've given up. If that isn't bad enough, I'm a genetic mess, short, had cancer, developed tinnitus, always in some sort of pain and on antidepressants for depression and anxiety.

So what more can I do but accept it and wait for the next shit bomb to hit."
disability,fcs6oeu,t3_eii95h,1577912187.0,"The NHS wheelchair service as someone mentioned, but you have to be referred to them for an assessment by your GP or in my case, my old case worker. So it might be worth asking your GP for a referral to your local artificial limb and appliance service. But be aware the chair you will be offered will not be state of the art, at least my Harrier plus electric wheelchair wasn't, on the positive side any repairs required while you LOAN the chair, (mine is currently 15+ year ongoing loan) are covered. 

if you no longer need the chair, you have to return it.

But there is no financial outlay needed if you met the requirements for an electric"

With this tap you can control the flow on the left and temperature on the right from 0c to 60c. But the temperature adjustment cannot be locked down as standard. But perhaps, it maybe possible to lock it down once a comfort temperature is found by removing an internal part to prevent the adjuster moving on the temperature side? But I am no engineer."
disability,fblpdax,t1_fbkxzya,1576966852.0,"I know exactly what u mean, lol. If it's anything like mine, you should be able to adjust the backrest angle or tilt by adjusting the screws holding the backrest in place until you find a comfortable angle. I had to do the same when I got my chair as the seat back was too upright and causing me, back problems.

Do a quick Google search for your chair manual, I found it easy enough, gives step by step instructions on how to do it."
disability,fbktb61,t3_edtgvo,1576955115.0,"The same thing happened to me when I moved from a manual to an electric. I think it's because of a completely different seating position being so high up and not being in complete control compared to a manual, it's something you will get used to and the chair looks really stable and has anti tip bars so you shouldn't tip. But make sure to go off a kerb backwards whilst leaning forward and try not to drive off a kerb at an angle as you and the chair may go over sideways (I have many times). But your chair seems far more sturdy than my NHS boneshaker invacare harrier plus and I've managed to survive so far."

disability,f6noyaw,t3_ds3ola,1572996477.0,"I copied this from a website pretty much covers it

 On most buses you just need to place your pass close to or on the smart card ticket machine beside the driver. When the machine recognises the pass as valid, it will ‘beep’ once and a light on the machine will change from amber to green. Your card doesn’t have to be taken out of any holder you may have put it in to be read by the ticket machine although the driver can still ask to see it to make sure it’s your pass.

But if your in a wheelchair and or have difficulty reaching the machine, you can ask the driver if they wouldn't mind scanning it for you. That's what I do."
CerebralPalsy,f3eiunb,t3_dgq6di,1570879306.0,"I'm 37/m with moderate cp diaplegia mostly affecting my legs meaning that when I'm out and about, I have to use an electric wheelchair. Over the last few years, I've definitely noticed that my condition has got worse especially since I moved into my own place and having to crawl around as it's too small for wheelchair use.  I'm trying to use a walker but after 20 years of immobility that's a saga of pain and stiffness, I'm hoping will get better in time. 

For me, recently it's been bouts of depression, where I cannot be bothered to go anywhere or do anything and wonder if I've got the strength to keep pushing forward at times. 

I've also begun to be increasing aware how easily able bodied people do things at similar age and how they are increasing difficult or impossible for me.

But I have to laugh sometimes, able bodied friends and family will moan to me about their lives and all I'm thinking is anytime you want to swap I'm down.

But I'm overall I'm grateful for what I have, as a lot of people are worse off than me."
