Not to mention. I'm not going out and farming insects to eat for my own enjoyment. Nor am I locking them in cages.

Death is an inescapable truth of life. People like to act like vegans are all anti death and worried that animals are going to die and thats not the case. We don't want systemic abuse, oppression, and exploitation of animals for needless things like fucking eating them when theres plenty of other food available to eat.

Additionally, bugs have an average life of a few days to maybe a few months? The amount that die just from shit happening isn't devastating the population of these bugs, nor is it torturing them. Nor is it intentional. Cows on the other hand, live to be around 20 naturally. But in slaughter houses they are almost all killed before they are 2. And dairy cows are killed after they're 5 years old. And if its a male baby. They're lucky to get a few months. Those few months of which its seperated from its mother, put in a small cage, surrounded by other calf's that are all in the same boat.

Don't forget too, cows are extremely social animals, often time having best friends for life. Mother and daughter cows especially bond strongly in their life.

Its not whether or not reaper will support the plugin. Its the fact that you need to rely on a 3rd party dev to keep these plugins updated. And when you're using a bunch of different software its more likely to cause instability and problems. 

Not to mention you have to pay the money to get most of the decent VST's that come stock in other DAW's

The graphic design isn't the issue people have with it. Its that its so barebones that it takes a lot more effort to get it to the level any other daw comes as out of the box.

Nobody is saying reaper is uncapable. But it is less feature rich than other daws and requiring use of 3rd party VST's is pretty annoying."

I agree, Reaper is perfectly capable at doing anything you would want to do in most any other daw. But you need to go to outside sources and that adds a lot more money and unpredictability because who knows if your favorite compressor plugin stops being supported and you need to buy another. You don't have to worry about ableton's compressor being unsupported.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fqgc7sb,t3_gimvqx,1589342660.0,"I'm a good bit newer to making music and everything so I'm maybe more on the other side of this and personally, I never liked those kinds of questions either. I think there are some basic things EVERY artist needs to learn regardless of the music they make.

But beyond that, I kind of just try and do my thing and if I struggle to make something sound good to me then I look up the theory for it to learn. I let my creativity and curiosity guide me through the learning and I like to try and learn as I go and that gets easier the farther in you are in music theory.

But theory isn't there to tell you what you can and can't do so much as its telling you what you should or shouldn't do. They're guidelines not laws. 

And like you and others said, its not linear. Learn as much as you can on your own, learn what sounds good to you, then look into why it works, or if it doesn't, why it doesn't work, and how you can maybe look to get it to work.

As an example. I've always struggled with understanding rhythm in music and I struggle so much with drums. I don't and can't play them so I program them. I really struggled getting things to work well, But I kept trying new things and all that, and I just struggled a lot. Then I looked some stuff up on how to program drums better and still struggled but I got a bit of info from that. So I tried more, looked it up again and the next time it clicked some more and I'm trying more things out and its going a lot better already! I'm still far from good but I'm understanding the rhythm and drum standards more because I'm experimenting."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fqgbkf5,t3_gidz8i,1589342234.0,"Everyone is comparing DAW's and honestly, who cares. Use what you like, that works for you, that inspires you to make music.

It doesn't matter which is better as long as all of them keep pushing each other to keep getting better then its a win for everyone."
PoliticalHumor,fqgao46,t1_fqfxxep,1589341652.0,"Be sure to pee on it too, don't be afraid, theres no hornets inside, its just part of their conspiracy to keep people from trying to mess with them. 

But we outsmarted them!"
arizona,fqga5ex,t3_gipa3y,1589341312.0,I live like 4 miles from FH and theres just cox and century link out here unless theres some new small ISP thats opened up recently that I don't know about.
arizona,fqga0mn,t3_gimbfl,1589341227.0,"Fucking dumbass. 

And the news isn't fucking helping. One minute they say ""Stay home, stay safe, keep things clean, things are serious"" then the story right after is ""Look at this restaurant opening back up!"" and they show these people not following proper social distancing, not wearing masks, no gloves, nothing.

People are fucking dying. Going out right now is a promise of death. Do people think that 3 months is enough for a virus to what, migrate away? Disappear? What do they think has happened to the virus that after 3 months its safe to go out?

How can you be SO fucking stupid? Its just amazing to me that people are so astronomically painfully stupid."

Deathcore,fqg98wu,t1_fqg8zqw,1589340736.0,"Ehh, its pretty much just a part of the genre at this point.

If you want the full experience of that concept album. You should listen to the 30 minute EP (song) Odyssey to the gallows, then go straight into Odyssey to the west. It really is the most full experience I've ever felt listening to an album. Its like the albums story plays in your mind like a movie (I know thats high praise but just give it a shot) 

Or just for an intro point, listen to Stone and Silver Part I - The Mountains of Man. Thats a good song to give you a rough idea of what to expect."
Deathcore,fqg8u1f,t3_giquaj,1589340473.0,"I mean, what do you expect from a mix of death metal and punk? 

I guess there are some that don't strictly focus on that. Old Make them suffer was usually more about relationships between people, Slice the cake has an entire concept album telling a story about a man leaving his wife to go on a journey west to find god (its fucking amazing)."
Metalcore,fqg5kss,t3_gil7c1,1589338459.0,"Theres some light EQ on literally everything you hear in music. If you want a good mix you need to properly make room for elements in each frequency area.  Its not as extreme as you may be thinking, but it does happen.

Theres also likely a compressor of some kind and maybe a de-esser but thats all stuff to make the overall song and recording sound good. Its not going to have a huge effect on the sound of their screams. And a lot of that stuff can be run live if they want. 

But things like auto tune, distortion, reverb, etc. Like others said, usually not. But its not like its never been done. And those things can be done in a context where it works really well. Its not always just there to make them sound better than they really can be. 

Also, if you want low vocals you can do better than FFAK and ABR ;) https://youtu.be/79ojlwMzs0Q?t=149

Apparently theres no real effects or pitch shifting on the ""Demolisher"" scream. (Im sure the studio version still has some light effects for mixing though.)"

I just really like having all the info in a list on the side of the screen that takes me to that area instead of how xcom 2 and EU were. Not that those were bad really, I just prefer the new way they did it for CS."

If he needs obamas old plans to ""succeed"" then why don't we just have obama in office again instead? Jesus these people are just stupid."
Metalcore,fqfksle,t3_gil38o,1589326683.0,I only used Google play music to play the music files on my phone and nothing more. It was helpful that it let you listen to files that are stored on your PC on your phone which was handy but maybe just make that an app instead.
modular,fqfjyor,t3_gifqh0,1589326255.0,Is this that moog synth they only had people build at their live shops that one or two times? I assume they released it fully now? Thats dope.

They're the real heros. Not these ""lol gun go brrrr"" idiots in the police."

comedyheaven,fqdf0oh,t1_fqdd26d,1589288202.0,True. It's just crazy seeing how much some of them have normalized it and act like it's just some recreational drug. It's a pretty dangerous place for people who might fall into that to go to.
