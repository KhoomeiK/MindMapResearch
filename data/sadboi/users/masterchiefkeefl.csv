financialindependence,eruaez1,t1_eru3tni,1561269459.0,I think it’s being trapped in the office and feeling like people with that type of work have more freedom. Which you quickly realize isn’t true. They more pressure to preform then you do behind a desk.
financialindependence,eruabxr,t3_c3vs9i,1561269352.0,Don’t go anywhere! If it’s not toxic to the point where you feel like you have to leave then stick to it. Not having your weekends alone will drive you mad especially if you have responsibilities. Side gigs and a few weekend projects are more then enough.
