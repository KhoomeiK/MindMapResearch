AMA,fnpa52n,t1_fnp8ylz,1587141910.0,"That’s a really hard question because it changes from day to day, but I would say big picture things are:

-People not understanding my needs. I’m a firm believer that mental health isn’t your fault but it’s your responsibility to manage. People don’t realize how hard it is on a daily basis to keep myself in check, and when I do need help/need someone to cut me some slack it’s really easy to sound like I’m using my MIs as an excuse. People who don’t experience don’t understand the severity of the symptoms I experience 24/7. Yes I’m flakey sometimes- not out of not giving a shit, but because my capabilities can be so unpredictable. I have lots of triggers that I can’t control, I have irrational fears that are very real to me even if they don’t make sense to other people.

-Stigma: there’s even stigma within the professional spectrum. I had barriers to being properly diagnosed and treated because of the stigma some of my diagnoses have. I hate hearing people say people are “so OCD” because they like things tidy, or someone is “totally bipolar” because their moody for a day. They don’t understand how debilitating these things are and how they are so much more than they are making them out to be. That only adds to the generalizations out there about MIs.

-The fact they are chronic. This stuff is never going to go away. I turn 27 at the end of this month and I basically lost my 20s to learning how to manage all of my stuff and accept that I have to work at it every day. I have to take half a pharmacy every day. I have severe chronic conditions and I feel too young to have so much stuff going on. I also suffer from chronic pain due to a physical health condition so it’s hard to accept sometimes. It takes a lot of effort to stay positive."

unpopularopinion,fnjb0lg,t1_fnbgc2s,1586995382.0,"I think this is a very good point, like I can tell you it’s the highlight of my day when 730 rolls around. My roommate and I literally keep an eye on the time so when it hits we can run out onto the balcony. Half the time I don’t wear my glasses when I really should, but you’d better believe I make sure I have my glasses on so I can see everyone else out on the balcony. 

I work in healthcare but had to take a leave of absence due to some of my own health struggles and it’s hard to know that I’m not out there fighting the good fight with my team. Seeing everyone out in all our neighboring buildings gives me a sense of community and a feeling of relief that we are all in this together. Also, maybe it’s the bubble I’m in, but everyone I know who enjoys doing it isn’t posting it on social media for points, and is in fact fighting for more rights for essential workers, and hard. This is a way to blow off steam, feel a sense of community, and know that people do actually give a shit. It’s nice to take a break from all the harsh shit going on and the heaviness of doing what you can to try and increase wages for frontline workers, hand sewing masks, in my city there’s a whole Facebook group dedicated to coming together to help the people most impacted by this. 

Now I’m not saying this to virtue signal, this is literally the first time I’ve talked about it, but I don’t think it’s fair that so many people are assuming everyone who’s doing this doesn’t give a fuck the rest of the time, or doesn’t do it for any reason other than to look good to others."

AskReddit,f9mwzjn,t1_f9m7uld,1575472114.0,"I’ve got a few questions because I’ve always been super curious about how I would feel if I was with someone who ended up getting rich and/or famous.

Is it hard to stay grounded in yourself and confident knowing that being famous means there will be a lot of romantic/sexual interest from a lot of people? How do you prevent yourself from comparing yourself to others in this regard?

Do you ever worry about cheating? Have you two ever talked about having an open marriage/would you ever consider it?

How does it feel to be with someone who has so much money? I know even when I’m in a relationship with someone who makes way more than me I’m stubborn about my financial independence. Did you have to get used to his financial situation? (I’m making wild assumptions here) but did it take some getting used to that he could just pay for things you couldn’t/pays for more things than you since he’s able to? (Again just an assumption going off of him paying for your degree, correct me if I’m wrong!)  

Do people recognize you as his spouse? I feel like a professional athlete isn’t in as much of a media frenzy as other celebrities so I’m curious how much things like news stories and paparazzi impact both of your lives as individuals, as well as your lives as a couple.

Assuming that you could give up work due to being able to live off of his income alone what motivates you to pursue a law degree? As I said before I am stubborn about my financial independence as well as just being an independent person as a whole so I can see why you would want to have your own thing. I could also see it being easy to say “fuck this” when things get stressful knowing you have the finances to fall back on.

From your experience how does being famous impact mental health for either him or the people around him? I feel like being a professional athlete would come with so much pressure which could really impact a person. How is that managed? I also wonder how fear of something like an injury which could be career ending is managed. I’m a seriously anxious person so I can only think about how much anxiety I would get and how it could get in the way of my performance leading to more anxiety. I’m curious how people with that level of success manage any anxiety or low mood or whatever comes up in that realm.

Does being married to a famous athlete put pressure on you in terms of your personal fitness? Is it correct to assume that fitness is a big part of your life seeing how his life is centred around it?

Do you ever wish you married someone “normal” maybe when you haven’t seen him in a couple of months, or you can’t celebrate your anniversary together- or are you completely content with the life you have with him? I don’t think I could ever do long distance and I’m always curious about how that works for people who make that choice in general, so I’m even more curious about it in this particular scenario.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. For some reason this thread has been fascinating to me and it’s been building up all these questions in my head as I go through it."
awfuleverything,f9l084y,t3_e5ngtw,1575411517.0,This is absolutely not feminism. This is super fucked up and any real feminist would agree with that.

myfavoritemurder,f5at05f,t3_dncr1m,1572113123.0,"Wow this is so so validating. I’m a peer support worker (for those who don’t know that’s someone who has had their own experiences with mental health and/or addictions and has gotten themselves to a fairly stable place and works in mental health to support others through their own recovery process.) I also have a background in social work.

I work with a clinical team that works in early psychosis intervention. I love my job. I know exactly what kinds of supports the people I work with need. I also work at the hospital where I did most of my own recovery, so I know a lot of the staff from when I was in treatment. It’s really rewarding to be able to provide clients with the exact supports I had wanted during my own recovery process. 

While the job is incredibly rewarding, it’s also incredibly demanding as it requires so much emotional energy. Day in and day out I am talking to people about the hardest time in my life, and connecting with them through shared experiences that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I work in outpatient services, however our clients can end up in in-patient and I regularly visit them and their families while they are there. 

Just this week I had a client end up in our ICU psych unit, and I wasn’t prepared for how it would make me feel to visit her. I have been on the two regular psych units plenty of times and I’m desensitized to it at this point, but I hadn’t been on the ICU psych unit since I had been a patient there during rock bottom of my own mental illnesses. My client was REALLY struggling and it brought me right back to where I had been. I was able to take some time after meeting with her to debrief and calm down, my team is really supportive and amazing. At the end of the day as hard as it can be, I love knowing that I get to be such a huge support for these people during some of the hardest moments of their lives.

I attend therapy myself, as I’m still in my own recovery. I have come a long way, and I’m stable now however I believe recovery is a lifelong journey and I’m always trying to get and be better, however because of this I do experience imposter syndrome a lot. I always wonder if I’m doing the best I can, and I worry when I’m having a harder time than normal if it’s going to get in the way of me providing the best care that I can. My coworker constantly reminds me that at the end of the day we are people first and we have to remember that. We can only try to do our best, and accept that for what it is.

This thread is incredibly validating and I’ve saved it to come back to when I need it. 

Thanks to everyone sharing their experiences

If your wife is cool with the LGBTQ community and the only thing you’re worried about is her taking some time to come to terms with it- I would tell her. It doesn’t matter that the information is that you’re bi, if there was any information about who my partner was as a person that they had kept from me for that long I would have to take some time to come to terms with it. On the one hand as your wife I would probably be a little upset that you felt you couldn’t tell me for so long, and on the other hand as the bisexual partner I couldn’t imagine keeping something like that a secret for so long.

askatherapist,ey9fcew,t3_cw7yyl,1566942050.0,"Obligatory not a therapist, however I work in mental health and I myself have a bunch of mental illnesses and a history of trauma that lead to this kind of attention seeking/impulsive behaviour and can speak from personal experience.

Mental illness isn’t your fault but it is your responsibility.

I have been in a relationship with an amazing person for 8 months now. It is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. Why? Because I’ve worked my ass off in tons of therapy, groups, counselling, etc. to get a handle on my mental illnesses. I hurt people before because I simply wasn’t well enough to be in relationships, and unfortunately people like you would enable my behaviour because once I knew I could get away with whatever I wanted, I didn’t have to worry about getting the help that I needed.

You can’t make her change, she needs to do it herself. When I was bad I made up so many excuses for myself but at the end of the day I knew what I was doing.

In the relationship I’m in now I love my partner enough that I communicate with him. If I’m feeling impulsive we talk about it. If I feel I need extra attention or validation we talk about it. I do what I need to do to keep myself in check, and he supports me in that. I don’t feel the need to lash out on him or jump into situations that would damage the relationship because I’ve been able to work on my recovery alone. I couldn’t have done that in a relationship. I also love my partner so much that the idea of hurting him keeps me in line.

PTSD isn’t an excuse for this behaviour. As someone who has it themselves from the same type of trauma it genuinely upsets me when people do things like this and blame it on their mental illness.

I don’t think things are going to get better between you two given what you’ve said. If you want to talk to me more about my experience feel free to message me. You’re in a tough spot, and you deserve better than this. She needs help you can’t provide for her."

askatherapist,exmbtlr,t3_ctgv1l,1566428386.0,"Nobody is going to be able to diagnose you over the internet. A source I’ve found to be really great at explaining mental health diagnoses is actually Wikipedia. I would suggest looking up bipolar on Wikipedia and giving it a read. If it sounds like you then talking to someone you trust and your doctor would be a good idea.

Even if this isn’t bipolar, it’s also not nothing. Getting low to the degree you’re talking about is still something important to check out. I suggest talking to your doctor even if you don’t think you have bipolar. 

There are so many different diagnoses out there, and many overlap. The only thing you can do to get an “official” diagnosis that can lead to medication and/or therapy is by getting a referral to a psychiatrist through your doctor who can give you a proper psychiatric assessment.

Edit: you can still get therapy without a psychiatric evaluation, and your family doctor might be able to give you antidepressants, however you might need different medications or therapeutic options that only a psych can get you."
relationships,exlydu9,t3_ctg7sc,1566421379.0,"As someone with my own severe trust issues I just want to say that you were strong as hell here and nowhere close to pathetic. My last relationship lasted about 4.5 years and consisted of me gaslighting myself constantly by telling myself the red flags were something I was making up due to my trust issues- I believed that I was LOOKING for something to be wrong and in doing so ignored some pretty substantial things because I “loved” him. When I finally started to realize things really weren’t okay I was Deep enough in it that I blamed myself and kept trying to make things better.

I’m so proud of you for doing what you did, you trusted yourself, you reached out for support, you didn’t let your feelings for him prevent you from leaving. You trusted yourself enough to know it wasn’t right, you were determined enough to end it even though you knew it would hurt. You showed real strength here. Even recognizing the emotions you have after the end of things and allowing yourself to name the sadness and feel it is all a sign of strength.

You’ve totally got this, and honestly having “trust issues” isn’t always a bad thing. They lead me to a super great guy who I got to know first as a friend for many years and slooowly build trust and now as my partner he’s taken things slow and earned it. Taking so much time with people meant I was also weeding out people that other people might have fallen for before seeing their true colours.

askatherapist,evq74iz,t1_evq65c2,1564687724.0,"You said in your post that you didn’t explain it well and were vague about it. 

If you are able to text her that might be a great way to express yourself. Often there are rules around what can and can’t be texted about so she might not be able to give you much of a response by text but at least she can read how you’re feeling. Remember though like I said, it’s often a skill to leave those silences. I can understand how it makes you uncomfortable however you have to remember if you aren’t talking  we can’t just fill all of the silence ourselves. I’ve sat in silence with people for a good 5+ minutes.

I would send something like;

“Hey, I want to talk to you about something and I feel more comfortable texting it and then maybe we can talk about it in our next session. I’ve been feeling really uncomfortable in our sessions to the point that I don’t feel I’m able to get anything out of it. I feel like there are too many silences that last too long, and it feels like I’m being analyzed the entire time. This makes me so uncomfortable that I am then unable to speak and honestly just want the session to end. Is there something we can do so that I don’t feel like there’s so much pressure on me? I’m way more comfortable texting than I am talking face to face so I thought this was the best way to explain it.”

Something along those lines (or not if that doesn’t feel right for you) but yeah you’ll have to explain it in detail so she truly understands what’s going on. If she still doesn’t change she just might not be the therapist for you."
askatherapist,evq4zyf,t3_ckqpjc,1564686497.0,"Obligatory not a therapist, but I do work in mental health and have gone through my own recovery journey which includes a lot of therapy. When I have a new client I do what I can to try and get to know them and build a relationship with them. If they are quiet it usually leads to me asking questions to try and engage with them. A skill that we are taught is to just let there be silence if that is what the client seems to need. It’s awkward for us too, but it often leads to the client finally saying something and can work really well to finally get a conversation going.

Sometimes I will ask clients about their body language. If they look like they are wanting to say something but aren’t talking I might encourage them, if they have their arms crossed and seem closed off I might ask if they are comfortable. I wouldn’t say that I think every move they make has a hidden meaning, and that’s also never been my experience being IN therapy either.

I by no means mean to minimize your experience, I can totally understand how you feel uncomfortable. I would say however that you might think more is happening than actually is. I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t get awkward for us too when there are long silences. We know if you are accessing these services there has got to be a reason and we work hard to try and make sure you’re getting the most out of your time with us.

I know it can be hard to talk face to face, however if you can I would push you to tell your therapist how you are feeling. They can’t change their behaviour if they don’t know it’s impacting you, and I can promise you we never want to make you uncomfortable.

You noted that you’re good with text. I very much relate to that, and what I would do when I was in therapy was keep a “therapy notebook” that way if I had something I wanted to bring up in therapy I could write it down to get the words right before I got to therapy, and then just read from my notebook to be able to feel like I could express myself better- maybe that’s worth a try here?

Edit: a word"
amiwrong,evcmuxo,t3_cjcvq9,1564418725.0,"I don’t think you’re a bad friend for having boundaries. I don’t think it’s great that you’ve said you’re always pushing “I told you so” at your friend, that doesn’t help anyone. It’s also not helpful to call her “crazy”, if you know anything about abusive relationships this is really common and she might feel trapped.

At the end of the day you’ve been very supportive and you’ve put a lot of energy into giving that support. It’s incredibly frustrating to see a friend making the same mistakes over and over- at the end of the day you can’t control them. The only thing you can control is your own actions. Setting up boundaries can be hard and feel selfish and it’s not. Taking care of yourself is essential.

Something I’ve had to do with a really great friend of mine who was going through something similar was say something along the lines of “hey, you know I love you and I want to support you, however I need my own boundaries. It’s so hard for me to see you repeating x behaviour over and over and looking to me for help each time. I can’t keep helping you when the behaviour gets repeated again afterwards. It takes a lot out of me and I really worry about you. I need to take a step back to take care of myself. If you do actually stop x behaviour and can sustain that I’ll be here and I’ll support you, but until then I need to take care of myself. I hope you understand.”

It was SO hard and I had to really work through my feelings of guilt, plus I worried what would happen without my help and support, but my friend did finally get to where she needed to be and reached back out to me and we were able to get back to a good healthy relationship. That was best case scenario, but I had made my peace with knowing I might have to walk away forever.

I hope this helps.

Edit: Instead of helping her move it would probably be a good idea to get her some information about resources for women in abusive relationships. It sounds like that’s the help she really needs."

sex,evc3xv3,t1_evatdsr,1564405577.0,"I fully agree that it’s a spectrum, I’m non-binary. The problem is that so many trans men and women don’t want the *trans label, and we as a society need to learn that there are just different kinds of men and women. Some women have penises, it doesn’t make them less of a woman, and vice versa. Your sister can identify however she wants, however I would be careful saying outright that women and trans women are two different genders because that causes a lot of erasure. This topic is complex. I get worried when I see people staying something outright when there’s so much more to it. It sounds like you’re supportive of your sister though and that’s huge!"

TooAfraidToAsk,euk3u0y,t1_euk3ejo,1563882897.0,"Exactly! That’s just it- this stuff isn’t new, it’s just becoming more widely accepted so people are coming out of the shadows. It’s like how being gay used to be unheard of so people hid it, and now that it’s becoming more accepted more people are able to come out. These people have always existed, and now these people are finally being able to express themselves in a way that makes them comfortable. You don’t need to fully understand it but as long as you respect these people and their identities and push the people around you to do the same you’re doing the best you can :)"
TooAfraidToAsk,euk1pip,t1_eujz92a,1563881956.0,"It’s not a figment of a persons mind- gender and sex are two different things. Gender is more of a societal construct in that it is largely seen as a binary. In society a lot of things are thrown into a binary simply because that’s the easiest thing but when it comes down to it not that much is really on a binary. Even with sex there is a scale- intersex people exist. Gender is your expression. Think a boy who likes dresses or a girl who hates them- it’s just society developing to be a more open and inclusive space where people can express themselves more the way they want vs. what society has expected. I’m non-binary and for me I’ve never really felt like I was a girl I’ve always felt more in the middle, and when I learned about non-binary I was like oh my god there’s a name for it. It’s similar to growing up and not knowing that bisexuality existed. I was just confused about my sexuality and always felt like I was on the outside of “normal” until I learned what bisexuality was and everything clicked into place. If you have any questions I’d be happy to answer from my perspective."

It was great because it was active and it helped me develop my art skills!

AskReddit,erda2gs,t3_c1hnyg,1560735467.0,"I struggle with a bunch of mental health stuff and I’ve been going through a particularly rough med change and was able to meditate myself out of today’s funk. Now I’m watching law and order cuddling with my cat, and I have tomorrow off so I can have a self care day."
askatherapist,eqbeyeg,t3_bxy2u2,1559948583.0,"I work in mental health- when in a support role it’s not appropriate to talk about the things you are personally struggling with or could be seen as something you are struggling with. The session isn’t about you as a professional it’s about supporting the client. Talking about her divorce would be completely inappropriate as it may come across as making the session about her. I will in passing mention my partner however if we broke up I wouldn’t tell that to a single client. If a client outright asked why I didn’t talk about them anymore I would say that we broke up and instantly move the conversation along. It’s not strange that she hasn’t told you, she’s doing her job.

I can see why you might feel that it’s strange on your end, but working in a support role our boundaries are really important. I have my own therapist too and I know how it can feel very intimate and close when you’ve seen them for a long time but you have to remember no matter what it’s a professional relationship and they have to keep it that way.

I recently had to take some time off of work for a personal emergency and just telling my clients that as vaguely as I could the conversation stopped being about them and became them trying to make sure I was okay which I had to brush over and turn the conversation back to them. Their time spent with me isn’t about me, I have my own professionals for that. They come to see me for a service which revolves around them so I have to keep the focus on them.

Does that make sense?"

relationship_advice,epmxou2,t1_epmk8mz,1559318686.0,Her making you out to be the overly emotional one is manipulative and abusive. I never comment on these things but hey you wanted this perspective. There are people out there who will have all the good without the bad. I was in a similar relationship and things went from this to way worse and only got worse and worse all the time. I was completely convinced that it was always my fault and I was always the one apologizing. When I finally got the guts to break things off I realized it had really impacted my self worth and it’s taken so much time to build myself back up and trust myself again. Now I’m finally in a new relationship that is healthy and amazing and I constantly wish I had gotten out sooner. For me it was almost 5 years. I wish I could have gotten out at 3.
relationship_advice,epmw3je,t1_epmpkdr,1559318152.0,"This is different though and hear me out- I don’t agree with double standards and if this guy was fully sleeping and she had sex with him secretly then yeah that would 100% be rape, however he did consent and she thought he was awake. I know for myself I’ve “woken up” and had full blown conversations with people who thought I was awake and the next day I remember none of it because I wasn’t actually as awake as I presented. I think going forward OP should just not have sex with bf if he’s sleepy or has recently been sleeping so this issue doesn’t come up again."
relationship_advice,epmmq2z,t3_bv6ayy,1559314996.0,"Hey so I have a whole bunch of mental illnesses and I find it hard to be open about them in my relationship. When I’m feeling really low I feel like talking to my partner about it would burden them. I’ve slowly gotten past this but I still have a hard time crying in front of him. My dad is very much a no showing of emotion kind of guy and so I’ve grown up feeling like I’m weak if I cry so I like to be alone when I feel like crying.

My advice is to not confront her WHILE she’s crying but maybe at some point when you’re giving her some cuddles or something where she feels safe and close to you bring it up in an empathetic way, and let her know that her sharing her struggles with you doesn’t make her a burden. I would say something along the lines of “hey I just want to let you know that I’m always here for you- I’ve woken up a couple of times and heard you crying. I wanted to give you your space because you seemed to want it, however I want you to know I’m here for you. I know it’s hard to open up about your depression and if you don’t want to right now that’s okay but I want you to know it wouldn’t burden me. I love you and want to help you through this in any way I can.”

There’s also an article I love that I’ve gone through with my partner- it’s about anxiety but I find it’s good for all mental illness. Maybe you could say something like “I’ve done some reading and found an article about how to support a partner who’s struggling with mental health- could we go through it together and maybe you could point out what parts of it would be helpful for you?”

https://kylarosesims.wordpress.com/2018/09/01/when-your-partner-has-anxiety-a-meltdown-guide/

I find the things that have helped me the most with getting better at opening up to my partner is him doing some research because it shows me he cares enough to take initiative, as well as him constantly reminding me that when I’m having a hard time it doesn’t make me a burden.

Feel free to DM me if you want to talk about this further. I actually work in mental health care so if I can be of any help I’m happy to!"
