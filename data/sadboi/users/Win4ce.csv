It was sensible on the surface. You promote free-thinking and all. You dismiss nonsense like flat-earthers, obvious bullshit. But skimming it shows some... Well, let's just say you're a bit late, the satanic panic was 30 years ago.

You talk ""do your own research"" because you want to win the argument but don't want to bear the burden of proof. You ask me to use Google, where I easily enter the realm of the fringe, on their terms no less, despite me doing this exact shit years ago and finding myself in a sea of uncertainty, where things look sensible on the surface but further research shows hoaxes and easily disproven conspiracies.
