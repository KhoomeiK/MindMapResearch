Point 1: This town has a single outer wall. The most distinct part of the country in AOT is the 3 massive walls of varying sizes. 

Point 2: this has a tower, not a keep.

Point 3: any good fortifications will have trees in a certain area around it cleared out so that they can not be used to hide a large opposing force. 

I mean no disrespect but the only real resemblance here is the design of the wall here  looking kind of similar to wall maria if you ignore the bulging outer districts missing.

Worth noting that this is nothing against the well built city, i can not imagine how much time and effort that took (so big that you can not even see that it is made of cubes).

Raze the town.

You set it up as a sacrifice and taking that from them is an insult in my eye. The best thing you can do here is put the town in ruin and the people in pain and suffering.

Make the fires of the good times act as the crucible that will break your party or see them crawl from the depths of despair, their steel tempered for the coming trials and their resolve renewed.

But you don't have to completely cut them off, let them try to rebuild the town and help those who survive recover or show it happening slowly if they return for other reasons
