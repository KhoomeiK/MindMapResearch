It seemed to strike him as odd that my condition was not recognized previously.  Probably helped that I was quite hypomanic during the assessment.

It's so frustrating that these blips aren't counted as hypomania, because they don't last long enough to qualify.  I believe they still should count as some kind of bipolar symptom, because the mood is still extremely elevated.

My comorbid C-PTSD was contributing to my BPD traits; but, now that I've been in safe, non-abusive environment for over a year, those traits are slowly diminshing.  My depressive and hypomanic episodes; however, are as present as ever.

bipolar2,foex7ir,t3_g71vcf,1587717963.0,"I wish I knew the answer, but I relate so much to your post.  The best coping mechanism that I've been able to successfully use so far is the 'wait 24 hours technique'.  

Before I make a rash decision, like continuing an argument, or throwing out some possessions that I feel sentimental about, I tell myself to walk away and wait.  If, a day later, I still feel the need to do whatever I was going to do, then I'll give myself permission to do it.

My bipolar ragey brain usually accepts this, because I'm not telling myself *not* to do something, only to wait a bit to do it.  This technique has saved me from making a lot of decisions that I would have later regretted.

Just a thought on something that helps me when I have intense feelings."

bipolar2,foc8z86,t3_g6ntio,1587668507.0,I find it really helps with my comorbid PTSD.  The difference in my startle response is huge.  So glad I gave it a try.
bipolar,foc7zkx,t3_g6o297,1587668180.0,CBD really helps with my comorbid PTSD - my hypervigilance and startle response are significantly reduced when I take my morning dose each day.  It really improves my quality of life.
