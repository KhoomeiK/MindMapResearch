now i see what was happening - my soul was telling me that that was not the direction i was meant to go. i never identified with material wealth and the depression came as a result of me acting against my self, my true calling. all i've ever truly wanted from life was community, connection, love & peace - to make our planet a better place to truly feel alive. 

i understand most people are not like us and i accept them as they are. but we have a different purpose here. material desire is not it, it is not enough. for me, it is experiencing a universal union with life and the cosmos, lifting up to higher dimensions of life experience.

this makes lots of sense. my mom told me she wasn't ready to be a mother when she had me, but my father insisted on having kids. during my childhood, she was emotionally absent due to a crappy marriage and my dad was out drinking with his buddies anytime he wasn't working. so i feel like i kinda figured out things on my own along the way and then realized other kids weren't like me at all. i would always be the kid that would want to sit with the adults at parties and then was told ""why are you here with the adults? go play with the kids your age"". feeling like an alien and not fitting anywhere (since i realized i was a person) broke my heart over and over. then eventually, in my late teens, it evolved to ""leave me, i am better alone being myself than accompanied with people and their expectations of how i should be"".

>What truly breaks my heart is how it's possible for INFPs to not even understand each other when they need it the most.

as a child, i really thought i was the only one that felt like an alien because i didn't know anyone like me. i kinda made a few introvert friends along the way, but even to them i was fake. i pretended to be bubbly and acted like my dad did when he was happily drunk, i saw how everybody loved him when he was fun. i thought that if i wasn't fun, nobody would care about me. but then i would break down as soon as i got home, exhausted from acting like a person i wasn't all day. 

i regret my behavior too. i was mean at a few kids at a point too. i was angry and frustrated because nobody understood me.

our souls will always crave for love, which will always be found in silence.. in listening to the songs of birds.. in the soft caresses of the wind on your skin.. in the smell of green emanating from the forests.. in the sound of rivers and oceans.. in the animals that come to us purely to share joy.. and in the beating heart fueled by the body, a vessel for our soul to serve our highest purpose ❤️

the rest (the good, the bad, the romantic love, the friendships, the hardships, comfort, struggles, etc) will always come and go. but eternal, infinite love and bliss will always stay with you and will never leave you alone ❤️"

intj,fo2kays,t3_g5chax,1587465646.0,"so here's what i've learned about boundaries: 

it's important to state your boundaries asap in a new relationship. and know your partner's boundaries too. 

it's important to let your partner know how far you're willing to go and pay attention to see if she's understanding or not, because being in a relationship with someone that doesn't respect your boundaries is not healthy.

i would kindly explain what healthy boundaries are and ask her to respect them. don't give up on finding a solution that works for both of you - this might mean that both of you have to compromise, but what matters is that you are making an equal effort in finding the best way to communicate and interact. 

the more you sacrifice your boundaries for her, the more you'll feel disrespected and unappreciated and that will deteriorate the relationship.

if you want to know more about setting boundaries, i suggest you checking out Dr. Nicole LePera, she's a fantastic psychologist that has lots of resources online for free on her website, instagram and youtube.

i hope this helps you out!"

i agree! most people are not into the stuff we're into and that's ok 😊 that's something i've learned eventually. it takes a while to find our tribe, but oh boy does it feel good when i find a deep connection with someone. when i see and hear them and they feel seen and heard. there's nothing like it!

one of my favorite mantras is ""live and let live"" i tey to live by it. for me, it embodies love, peace and acceptance 🙏❤️"

to me, friendship is about establishing a true, deep connection with another open & honest soul, willing to talk about core values, dreams, struggles, philosophy, the environment, animal and human rights, personal development, self-love, healing trauma, existencial questions, etc. i love discussing deep shit. the shit that keeps you awake at night and that gets you out of bed when you wake up. what gives you purpose. what makes you depressed. what brings you ecstatic joy. what gives you panic attacks. what makes you grateful for being alive.

since not many people fit this criteria, i've never had lots of friends. some people just want to keep it shallow and i respect that, but i am not into it. talking about the news or random practical day to day stuff has never been fulfilling for me. i get deeply bored and tired, and then i need to isolate myself and dive into art to replenish my cup.

i've always preferred silence or alone time to shallow conversations."

mbti,fms5qle,t1_fmpit31,1586347404.0,"thanks for your input!

until recently, i've experienced life in very intense highs and very intense lows and it's kind of exhausting. i went from feeling ecstatic from being depressed in less than 48h. i used to sleep around 10h a day, if possible, and if i couldn't, i would be sleepy and tired. it has improved a lot since i've been trying a more logical approach to feelings.

i don't think it's healthy to live in an emotional rollercoaster. i also don't want to repress emotions since it's not healthy. it might be the oldest cliché ever, but maybe it is because it's true: i guess balance is the key 🙏"
mbti,fmkue16,t1_fmiap40,1586169043.0,">the pain comes not from the act of questioning my own existence, but rather not finding an answer satisfactory to me---is a window that looks to the answer I seek. And so, every wrong answer that I find, or as I further delve down the path of introspection, the more dead-ends I am face-to-face with means the closer I am to finding the answers I seek.

that was beautifully put into words! i totally agree with you. suffering will always be part of the journey. i am thankful that i experience it because it means i keep shattering the illusions my ego unconsciously creates and i get closer to truth.

i was just mentioning that since i wasn't mature enough to understand this in my teens, i kinda got sidetracked & addicted to being depressed and it was hard to break that habit. it was easier to feel sorry for myself than trying to change my perspective on things. i wasn't ready to dissect my ego. 

now i embrace and cherish the suffering as a lesson, as a push towards the right direction for me, instead of feeling sorry for myself. it has been empowering 😊🙏❤️"

each relationship is unique. you are the one who must figure out what type of relationship you want/need and how you want to behave and feel in it. for me, it's a continuous practice of conscious work - meditating, journaling and acting with intention. 

you might be struggling with self-worth, boundaries or unhealthy attachment, i can't really say, and no one can say it better than you - the constant observer and witness of everything you think, feel or do. 

for me, it's about being willing to observe my behavior and intentionally deciding how i want to show up in the world.

i would sit down with him and make it a challenge: for the relationship's sake, let's strip down our egos and honestly talk about our paths. do they cross in the present moment or not? do your dreams and goals align with mine? do we make each other better or is it time to move on? 

maybe you'd be better off single. maybe there's just a huge black hole in your communication and you both feel unseen and unheard. maybe, joining forces, you can fix it. maybe you can't. but you can't know until you know. and to know, you need to talk about it. 

if you don't talk about it honestly and openly, egos aside, you'll just watch the relationship slowly die until you're left with nothing.

my dad always made me feel like a financial burden for the family. he made a lot of money with his restaurant in the 90s but saved none. then the crisis hit and he always made sure me and my brother knew how much of a burden we were to him. always complaining and screaming about how he had to work really hard to support us, always made me feel bad for existing and taking space. i was a teenager and my brother was a child, we couldn't work to help him. my mom always worked and saved money for the family. she always supported us, while he didn't want to study, jumped from crappy job to crappy job and complained all of his life about not having enough.

he used to complain until i was so fucking mad that i asked him why he wanted kids in the first place. 

when i met my partner's dad, i was shocked at how much he helps him. i was shocked at his availability. he saved money for them and always was and is prepared to help his sons whenever necessary, instead of screaming at them. it was a shock, a crash of realities when i understood their dynamics."

be the parent we needed when we were little. be the parent we need right now, for our inner child. comfort them, give them loving hugs and know that *you got your back*, no matter what.
