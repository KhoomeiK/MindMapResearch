Who else besides them would have known where it was or how to access it? was it easily visible / accessible? was it common knowledge that it was abandoned? 

It says Tofield has strong aboriginal roots, he might have been native. The killer (or killers) put limestone to try and speed the decomposition but they had added water in there too, if they had known these two don't mix (they'd do the opposite and preserve the body) then this is their first time doing it but they had enough knowledge to know how limestone works. 

The victim was tortured before being shot in the head, the killer must have had a great hatred for the victim, it looks like a premeditated murder, the killer put thought into this. 

1. The victim was selected beforehand, he might have been tricked into going to the farmhouse for work since the theory is that he might have been a construction worker or farm laborer. 
2. The killer knew the area well: a) that it was abandoned (not in use) b) that the owners of the property rarely came along.
3. Knew limestone could speed up decomposition but made the mistake of adding water which preserved the body
4. The victim probably wasn't from the area, might have been a traveler or an immigrant looking for work. The killer took advantage of this. 
5. Victim was sexually mutilated, wrapped up in a bed sheet and nylon rope = did they check to see if the crime happened in the farmhouse?"

Anyone know more about the autopsy report besides his weight and the faint scar on his abdomen? Could they confirm if he was ill? last contents of stomach ?

Is there any sightings March - June? **Was he well stocked in food?**

EDIT: He starved to death and was found with over $3,000 in cash. Something must have prevented him from getting food (he had a bad knee right? Did the autopsy confirm that besides the pictures that show a brace on his knee?). If he was well stocked this wouldn't be the case. To me it looks like:

1. He was well stocked in food but fell ill and couldn't feed himself (he was at a point where he was wasting away)
2. He wasn't stocked up, had the money but could not physically get somewhere for food = he starved to death.

How is this a bad thing? 

I feel the need to clean something because I'm going to use something, then I'm going to clean it again because I used it. So do you buy utensils or dishes/cups from a store and you just use them straight away? I wash all that, it doesn't hurt anyone if I use some dish soap and water.

>Many hosts use protective covers for their mattresses and pillows. Where would you store theirs?

I'd let them know beforehand that I'll be using my own protective covers and to leave everything bare. If they are concerned or if I can find a host who will be there when I arrive, I can show them the items so that their minds are at ease on that front. 

>I dislike the scent of scented laundry detergent. I would be upset if you replaced my linens with ones that had been washed in scented detergent.

I don't use anything scented (not shampoos/conditioners/soaps/cremes/laundry detergent etc.) because I can't handle the smell, even scented candles make me sick and I know others might be sensitive to them so I don't use them even when I get them as gifts.

At most I'd spend maybe 5-7 minutes in there, only 2-3 minutes to wipe the inside of the fridge down with the door open.

I don't have the plan for the final restorations on 7-10 or the info on 13, nor do I have the x-rays. Out of curiosity I wanted to know how much this would cost me out of pocket (or through a payment plan). Sorry if I'm not of much help."

personalfinance,etyjhif,t3_cdy52k,1563318828.0,"Woah, I was just doing the exact same thing last week. I looked through my statements for the last couple of months and realized I've been spending about the same as you a month on take-out. I'm usually responsible with my money and have a system in place about administrating my funds but these last few months I've been neglecting that.

What I used to do was buy something like salmon or chicken from Costco and prepping meals a day before. I'd switch it up and do salmon/rice/vegetables on day and chicken/vegetables and add options like pasta or some mash potatoes. I'd leave it ready the night before and in the fridge so that as soon as I got home all I had to do was put it in the over or steam it. Maybe shop every 1-2 weeks (depending on the variety of meals you want to prep). 

&#x200B;

I'm a very picky eater so it might sound weird to only stick to chicken/salmon and or vegetables/rice so you might want to look up some easy recipes either on YT or online. Maybe on the weekends if you're not busy try experimenting new recipes or variations, you never know. I'd also suggest those delivery meal services like Blue Apron or Hello Fresh, I've heard mix reviews on those but nevertheless I'd give that a try if meal prepping is not a possibility. If your issue is time on shopping, you can always try services from supermarkets that deliver (like Stop n Shop's Peapod delivery service or Shoprite's service) where you can pick what you want and have it delivered to you.

In the end no matter what decision you decide to take, save those extra hundred dollars a year by investing it in something that costs you less."
cna,etyhspo,t1_etx2qgx,1563318205.0,"Ah, I see. I think I was just lucky (is it though?) that my facility had a little of everything, from younger to old and those who had some mobility and others who had none and were rarely responsive. Do you know if your agency does in-house training though? or can you speak to someone about any doubts/concerns you might be having at these other facilities with you feeling you weren't trained with a particular kind of patient?"
securityguards,etvl3l5,t3_cde9mt,1563238215.0,"You do realize you have the right to work in a clean and safe environment right? talk to your supervisor or HR, tell them (better yet document it and show them via pictures/video) that the location is unsafe. They can't fire you if they refuse or ignore you and you go and talk to OSHA about it. I knew someone would called OSHA because the location had no access to a bathroom, once OSHA got involved they had to bring fix it. That person still works there too."
cna,etvkmqm,t3_cdor1a,1563237865.0,"\- Sufficient staffing - reasonable x number of patients/residents per CNA. If it's at a facility/nursing home there should be 4-5 CNAs and at maximum 6 people per CNA. I used to work at one where I was assigned 12 and sometimes 14 people (when someone didn't show up at the last minute) and 10 of them were incontinent/bed-bound/wheelchair-bound/dementia etc. like that's excessive. 

&#x200B;

\- Sufficient training in all areas: Dementia, Hospice, LTC, Vent units etc. I was only working at my facility for a month when they threw me in to do the vent unit. I was lucky that some of the senior CNAs are super into their jobs and had no problem having me shadow them and we shared assignments. CNAs should be allowed to shadow more senior CNAs for a day or two to ask questions, observe and get a hands-on experience with people and equipment. 

&#x200B;

\- Strict policy on the ""no-shows"" and the ""call out 5 minutes before the start of my shift"" people, that doesn't flow. We were extremely understaffed on most days, it was ridiculous how many got away with it and the rest of us were mandated or had our arms twisted to stay extra hours or to pull a double. I understand people get sick and things happen, but keep track of people who like to call out a lot. Better off letting them go and hiring people who actually want to work."

I never saw any mistreatment on my shift, people who mistreated people tended to get fired pretty quickly because word spread around the facility. I had the patience of a saint at work but once I got home, I'd have no patience for anyone else; story of my life."
