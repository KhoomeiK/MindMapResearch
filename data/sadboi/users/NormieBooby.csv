So they slept on a mattress on the floor in the drawing room. My cousin, who was probably 6 years old at the time probably shit his pants I guess. Bare in mind we were not informed of this by his mom. She simply wiped his dirty bottom with the bed sheet and threw it in the 'drty clothes basket'. Long after they left, the house was smelling awful for the whole day.

Only after my mom took all the clothes out of the basket to clean them, did she find out the bed sheet that had been used to wipe the poo off of my cousin's rear.

Never invited them to our home again."

You did the right thing OP.

This is an enforceable agreement, an Executory contract which has legal consideration. You fulfilled the offer which was posted publicly. Meaning they are liable to pay the said amount. 

Take her to the court and sue her before she tries to accuse you first."

 It might be possible that she was having pregnancy cravings, and thought that she was gonna get away with it. But she got caught. 

But a box of chocolate isn't a huge amount of money. She was willing to pay for it. And you could've let her off with a warning or asked never to come back to the store again. 

It's a bit too harsh to get someone arrested for shoplifting expensive chocolates. I mean how expensive can a chocolate get? And if it's that expensive, maybe keep it in a place where no one can easily open and eat it."
