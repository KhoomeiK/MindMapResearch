Whatever you experience in the ages of 13-20, they matter, they're important and they're a big deal. If there's one thing I would tell to my young self back then is, take yourself seriously. All those old heads who tell you it doesn't matter forgot what it's like to be there. First heartbreak, loneliness, bullying, stress from school - it's all serious. It's like how poverty isn't just 'having less money' but also leads to a different psychological state than those who aren't poor. I don't know what you're going through, but whatever it is - take yourself seriously and dismiss those who are dismissive of you, really.

That's the challenge though. I HAD to make a big change, to try to change everything from the bottom. That's because nothing worked, and I mean really NOTHING.

Eh, I don't believe in belittling young people's feelings. The whole 'teenagers are hormonal and stupid and should shut up' is a horrible way to raise and support. If anything, I actually want to go to work at education because I tend to take them more seriously than others my age. Young people often comment that I'm not as dismissive of them as others.

It's not so much that childhood (in this case, teenage years) were bad or good. They were empty, that leaves you with a void. You didn't learn anything. You didn't survive anything (speaking solely of my experience, by the way).

Did you find yourself doing radical changes? Did you do the whole ""Alright, I'm restarting my life. Everything is in doubt. I was wrong all along""?

I know what I did here is what I'm supposed to do there. I could do that because you offered different ideas and perspective. Even if I 'shoot down', I stood in front of a challenge.

I want to switch genders so life would become different, more interesting. I need NEW challenges. The old ones are boring.
