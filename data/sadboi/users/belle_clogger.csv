BusinessFashion,fqz8b4u,t3_glc92c,1589761980.0,I try to find high waisted bootcut pants. Or just high waisted pants in general since they tend to not move around as much on me and tend to make my outfits look more put together as a whole when I tuck my shirt in. If also depends on the material that the shirt is made of. I found some super comfy shirts on stitch fix that are made of a stretchy tshirt material but can be dressed up.

changemyview,fprnkqo,t1_fpqv5si,1588858318.0,I think another thing that’s missed is some of the preexisting conditions that can lead to being overweight like polycystic ovarian syndrome. I personally have an issue with digesting food and not breaking it down properly so it adds a lot of weight because everything just gets stored as fat. To some extent I think the body positivity movement is helpful in that it contributes to better mental health which can encourage people to become more active or make other lifestyle changes.

It will be tough but you are never alone. We’re all here for you.
relationship_advice,fpk70ha,t1_fpk513m,1588689214.0,"No one has invalidated you. Why are you “pepper spraying first and apologizing later” if you hate the concept so much?  The point is that if someone feels unsafe or that they’re being followed they shouldn’t be afraid of doing what they can to get away in order to not hurt someone else’s feelings or break politeness. Pepper spray won’t stop someone who truly intends to hurt you but it can buy you precious seconds that might save your life. 

Another thing to remember is that there can also be a backdraft that causes pepper spray to go towards the person spraying it instead."

polyfamilies,fmw7ipn,t1_fmw6vyd,1586441196.0,I think if I were in that situation I would want to be able to carry my own child if possible. There’s a different type of connection made between the one carrying and the one being carried. It’s also much further outside of your control. Of course the surrogate can sign a contract and whatnot but maybe she’s uncomfortable with not being able to know what’s happening while the child is forming.
polyfamilies,fmw6hgf,t1_fmw67gp,1586440584.0,That definitely explains it better. I think not including the bit about her wanting the same thing and the reasons you couldn’t do it fill in the whole picture. I don’t want to assume anything about you. But have y’all had a conversation about maybe having a surrogate or some other conception/birthing alternative? Perhaps that’s not the right answer but it’s just another thing to think about.
