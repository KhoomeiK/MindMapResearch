Because at those resolutions a 32 in. display capable of displaying 2160p resolutions is not worth the money since you can buy a ""cheaper"" 32 in. display with 1440p resolution and G-Sync for less money and for better performance.

Everyone's got a wallet to keep them at bay....

>Most gamers who play on PC are not targeted 2160p resolutions and 60fps. As the price for entry at that level is a 2080ti. Gamers on PC are targeting 1440p resolutions with 120fps and Gsync for smoother gameplay. This is because consoles are already targeting 4k resolutions with 30 fps frame caps and the gameplay is not smooth at all. 

Come again? People have said with enough tweaks you can hit 4k/60.... and for a while 60 was on the table with consoles, no? Or it could've just been a case of CEO's yes-ing people to death...

>But the reasons why consoles are targeting 2160p are because of display resolutions. For console gamers, the target display size has been getting larger over time. Many living room TVs are 55 inch at minimum. At that display size and distance from the gamer, they need a higher resolution (4K) in order to get good pixel density. PC gamers on the other hand tend to sit about 1 foot away from their monitors and max out at 32 inches. So pixel density is not a concern yet for PC gamers. 

But realistically if your TV panel can technically hit 4k/120 (and ya, the inputs normally may only be able to hit 60 that doesn't mean the OS is....) technically people would like to actually match the content to the capabilities of their gear... THAT'S why people are fixated on it. Because it sounds stupid you ""can't play 4k games on 4k TV"" (no matter what platform you have) if you ""can watch 4k movies on 4k TV""."

And we totally saw live gameplay last week. Digital Foundry commented on the UE5 tech demo showing 1440p/30fps. Does that sound like 8k or even 4k gameplay? No. How are people so confident Sony/M$ will make good on their hype? Do you think we even matched UE4 levels of fidelity? 

>Well, now these consoles are rocking some insanely powerful Ryzen CPU's and RDNA 2 APU's that put mid end PC's to shame. Is that somehow not a good thing? Hopefully now Dev's will have good reason to design their games to take advantage of better hardware.

Desktop hardware does not equal console or even mobile hardware performance, where things will likely be clocked to accommodate a low thermal output and quiet operation. How about the 99% likelihood that they'll be stocked with a proprietary locked down OS dictating performance? 

>And if you find this threatening, relax. Within a year or two PC hardware will have improved enough and dropped in price sufficiently that mid end PC's will again overtake the new consoles.

Another side of the other platform hate is the sheer misinformation being provided. I'll give an example. My dad (when he was still alive) used to read articles in magazines like The Economist talking about how the iPad would put desktop/laptop computers under in the industry. Ok, so you basically have access to email, a web browser, and maybe a picture gallery. That still doesn't account for creative apps available on PC. It definitely didn't have DAW functionality like I used computers for back then. So no, in some markets, an iPad is totally insufficient. 

After a while people are sick of being lied to."

Sometimes you wonder how these same folks go about putting together a bowl of cereal."
pcmasterrace,fqgl3gi,t1_fqet49w,1589349196.0,..... so like $350 + $180 minimum? That's still a lot for 3 games in comparison to the amount I can get on steam for the same amount of money (like literally at least 20 titles).
pcmasterrace,fqgkix4,t3_gio3l4,1589348739.0,"Sorry to hear of your bad luck. If it's any consolation, building a PC between fighting with unemployment is a feeling of achievement....I built my first PC literally after I got laid off too.

Good luck finding a new gig."

pcmasterrace,fqgk3nn,t3_gialae,1589348400.0,I do! That's why I have that solitary blue power button on the case and no windows. Lol.
pcmasterrace,fqgjw00,t3_gipypg,1589348235.0,"Tho when we're told by publishers ""_______ will run at AT LEAST 30 FPS and we'll reduce the scale of the game so it's well optimized"" everybody goes ""oh, that sounds ok"" vs asking ""what year is this? Oh, ya. The one I tell you go fuck your hat"".

For those who think I'm being harsh.... you have to lower your voice pitch and do your best executive imitation to gauge how stupid they sound."

pcmasterrace,fqgj8lr,t1_fqg3hje,1589347726.0,There's points in management tho that are never easy.... like adding drives in a case and not opening up both sides to wire up.
pcmasterrace,fqgj1g9,t3_gipcf4,1589347570.0,"Learning how to wire up the case is the real bitch in building.... another is the surprise that unlike all the YouTube building lords, you'll have to put standoffs in the case before you start anything."
