You have to sing rhymes back until one of you loses. If you loose, the horse skull can steal your beer. If you win, the horse skull will go away without taking anything."

You look really good though, if you think you're fat then work out. I started slimming down and I'm now a little more confident about my body and alot more self confident since I feel alot better. You're 18, there are alot of people that still look young when they are 40. Think about the future. Your friends going to be wrinkley when you are going to look 30 when you're actually 70, feel proud. By the way, I think you are very pretty."
amiugly,ezrfqnq,t3_d1rsmq,1568073219.0,"First off girls are bitches, I know since I am one. Secondly, if you know you need to lose weight, work out a bit. My self confidence boosted since I started to work out. Also, you're not unattractive. You might have a little acne, but that is only annoying to deal with. Everyone at least had acne in their teens and young adults, if they never had it before, its either they we're blessed with good genes, or they're robots. Anyways, Hang out with friends, watch movies, live life without obsessing about what you look like. My only request is that you learn how to untangle headphones."
amiugly,ezre3hb,t3_d1uvn2,1568072506.0,"You're not bad looking. I like your glasses and your hair. I read a few things saying that your mouth looks like it's posing - which I agree with, but if it's hard for you to smile, just try to seem happy and not dead, even though most people on Reddit is depressed. I think your self confidence/ self-esteem will get better if you see how attractive you are when you smile. I sometimes just look at myself in the mirror and try different faces. I  got some of my closest friends by complementing something - like a sweatshirt with a spongebob reference. Also, working out gave me alot of self confidence. If anything, I don't think you're ugly."

stories,ey4a48h,t3_cv8qlt,1566786012.0,"When I was younger, I got similar visions - but with only one 'shadow person.' 

It was tall and it had long limbs, it would follow me around. It 'spoke' sometimes and it would tell me to harm myself. I followed what it said - because I thought it was real. 

Long story short, I got therapy. My therapist said I had a huge imagination and it probably started when I saw a picture or something. 
 I would recommend talking to someone like a therapist - if you want it to stop. I don't see anything anymore but I still get spooked out by shadows."
