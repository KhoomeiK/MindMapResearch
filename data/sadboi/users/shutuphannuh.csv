AskReddit,f302gdk,t3_det8kb,1570544857.0,Youtubers/influencers when they get called out on their bullshit and lose their sponsorships and fan base. My favorite is when they‚Äôre caught blatantly lying or when their gross racism and homophobia gets dug up

relationship_advice,f0r0tle,t3_d5z2lt,1568871024.0,I stopped reading when she pulled the ‚Äúthem or me‚Äù thing. Them. Pick them. Why would you want to be with someone who wants to come between you and your oldest/closest friends?
BravoRealHousewives,f0nlptd,t1_f0nlbev,1568773429.0,"Totally agree about Kelly! She shouldn‚Äôt have taken the mallet to the bowl. She should have known that she would‚Äôve taken issue to it. Shannon really holds herself to a high moral regard, but her two best friends are arguably two of the most iconic bravo villains. Who have been INCREDIBLY shitty to her in the past. I don‚Äôt get it."
BravoRealHousewives,f0nlie4,t3_d5r1bg,1568773269.0,"I know!! I was happy that they demoted Vicki but they need to scrub Tamara and Shannon. Kelly is a dick, BUT at least she‚Äôs entertaining. Tamara is simply vile, Gina needs to take some time for herself to find her keys and a calendar for her court dates, Emily is...not cut out for reality tv, Braunwyn is an ok addition, but this shit with her mom just bums me out and I want her to match the mean girl energy from Shannon."
BravoRealHousewives,f0nkwhp,t1_f0nkmzs,1568772800.0,Probably!!! Shannon seems like a fickle friend and will allow her neuroses to convince her that she has been slighted in some way. Like she‚Äôs definitely that friend that you have to weigh your words around because you never know what‚Äôs going to trigger.

funkopop,eyojxta,t1_eyojjan,1567278288.0,"Yeah, I think she has pretty much grabbed all of the ones that she likes from movies and tv, she‚Äôs more so interested in getting the super collectible ones that‚Äôll be worth some money in a few years. This is the new beanie babies right?"
funkopop,eyoju84,t1_eyofpdg,1567278239.0,I think she‚Äôs covered those bases for the most part. I think she has like 200+ now. She‚Äôs more interested in the ones that are going to be worth some money in a few years.
bipolar,eykbi5p,t3_cxbfb1,1567143785.0,"Same, I tend to stay on the depressed end of the spectrum but man, have I had a manic ass summer lol. Every year I start to get looney tunes around the beginning of the season and it goes on till October. I have rapid and intense hypomanic episodes followed by shame/regret induced depression by I ruminate over what fucked choices I made while I was on the upswing. I‚Äôm on day 4 of damage control after my 3rd episode since June.  Although the constant self-hate talk is a little more quiet than it had been on Monday, i think I may have ptsd from the cringe flashbacks I‚Äôm having."

bipolar,es10mnb,t1_erzr96y,1561486772.0,Would be more harmful to start taking the ~2wks worth of lamitcal (sp?) again? AmeriCorps has ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù but it‚Äôs mainly an out-of-pocket-and-they‚Äôll-reimburse-at-some-point

IWantOut,eotfle2,t3_bsy7p7,1558840285.0,"You do not want to get a public education in America. You are much better off finishing high school literally anywhere else. The American school system is total shit and the government doesn‚Äôt take care of nor give a shit about the teachers or facilities. They also don‚Äôt care about the well being and safety of their students. As of May 9th there have been 15 school shootings so far in 2019. School districts aren‚Äôt allowing students to graduate from high school because they didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay for lunch. All that the schools over here do is teach you how to pass standardized tests. That‚Äôs it. If you truly want to come to America to finish high school, look into private schools and boarding schools."
bipolar,eoky95p,t3_bsa39r,1558663289.0,I used to experience crying spells. I think it‚Äôs pretty normal in ppl with bipolar disorder.
