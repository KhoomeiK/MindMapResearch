It largely follows a group of scalp hunters who are hired to kill Indians.  Gets philosophical in areas and has traces of classic literary images."

The people from that time didn’t see God for who He was, or else they would have accepted Jesus, since He was from God.  We wouldn’t do any better if Jesus came again in the flesh.

So even if He did reveal Himself it wouldn’t change anything.  Judas walked with and saw Jesus perform all kinds of miracles and he still betrayed him for 30 pieces of silver.  I’ve always felt that if God came to earth today as a man, we would kill Him all over again.  Human beings just don’t learn.
