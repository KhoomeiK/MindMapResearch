2. He’s morally ambiguous. You’re not really sure where he stands until the very end

3. He’s unashamedly awful and gives zero fucks. Severus Snape is not a nice person, you love to hate him but he helps out anyway. He makes Wolfbane for Lupin even though it’s a long and unpleasant process. He watches out for Harry even though he loathes him

4. He’s brilliant and creative with his magic. His potions book, his spell crafting are good examples 

5. He’s incredibly brave. The scene at the end of GOF where Dumbledore asks him if he’s ready still gives me chills 

6. He tried to redeem himself. He made a bad decision as a very young man (joining the Death Eaters) with horrible consequences (the death of Lily) and spent the rest of his life trying to atone for it. He very obviously lived with tremendous guilt and it’s my head canon that he’s profoundly depressed

relationships,fn4opx5,t3_fzd8yo,1586645726.0,"Hi 

I was in your situation in my mid 30s - I was widowed with a toddler after my husband passed from cancer

I tried dating after a while - I was really lonely and I missed having someone close to talk to. I saw a coworker for a few months but although the sex was great, there was no real connection 

I went online and went on a few dates. No one really captured my attention and these guys weren’t really interested in anything other than casual sex (which is ok, just not what I wanted)

One night a little voice said “Look at the widowers”. All the guys I’d met we’re divorced and didn’t realise what I had been through 

There were 2 widowed men in my area. One was an Irishman wearing a dress (true story) and the other one was a single father of a 7 year old daughter 

I met the single father and fast forward nearly 11 years and we’ve been married for 7 years, have another daughter together and we’re currently sitting in bed, drinking tea and eating toasted hot cross buns

The moral of the story is maybe try and find someone in a similar situation."
