My brain also treats people I care for like a special interest. I remember everything they do and say. One guy I loved (well, love, I'm hoping it'll pass, but worst case scenario I learn to live with it and I'll love someone else simultaneously) used to make semiserious ""jokes"" about how I memorized it all to be able to use it against him, when in reality I just cared for what he had to say. And people claim they've never met anyone as good at gifts as I am cause I can put the pieces together and/or remember what they say they like and want. Even if it was months ago and in a completely different context when said thing wasn't in focus.

So yeah. Definitely atypical. As for the intensity... I've been in love twice and it's not neccessarily that I feel more safe around them, I get nervous and self consious.

High IQ *AND* high EQ, and when I look them in the eyes I can sense their thoughts; ""I know just what to say to wrap you around my little finger, and you're cute so I'm gonna do it""... That's fucking sexier than sex."
AskReddit,fpoirkk,t1_fpofeki,1588785193.0,"I'm a woman and the two times I've actually been in love I've written love songs for them but never showed them cause I thought it'd be ""too much"" and they'd stop being into me. Maybe next time I should..."
AskReddit,fpofx95,t3_gelnee,1588783825.0,"I'm autistic and ""high functioning"" which means people don't believe me cause I don't ""act autistic"". I wish they'd understand how much energy it takes to act like them to make sure they don't feel uncomfortable, and how I don't sometimes escape the room or suddenly seem to shut down emotionally, going low verbal and start ""acting autistic"" to be rude, but because my sensory issues become too much... Too much noise and too bright lights drains me and makes me panic. I want them to understand that it's not that I'm not trying, it's that I am always trying but sometimes my best efforts aren't enough. 

I usually like being an aspie though. I like my brain and most of the ways in which I function... So another thing I'd like people to understand, that may seem contradictive to the first thing, is that me being autistic isn't a tragedy. They should not feel sorry for me; in fact their pity is pretty offensive."

I love it!"

I do not hate everything anymore, and we're uhm... Somewhat friends, kind stranger. Hope you're doing well too!"

Edit: capitalism sucks in general. But if I wanna be able to afford both food and rent, I have to look for the cheapest shit I can find. Most people in this world aren't as rich as you, dude."
