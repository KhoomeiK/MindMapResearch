TooAfraidToAsk,evl7trl,t3_ck6fdj,1564591394.0,"knowing nothing interests you like it used to. all those childhood passions. 

letting your responsibilities pile as you are unable to physically do them.

talking yourself down about endless opportunities in fear of failure. the feeling that you are already a failure, a burden, and a disappointment by just being alive. 

constant self-deprecating feelings. no one likes you. you’re ugly. you’re terrible. you’re annoying and pathetic. 

you catch yourself eating more because you’re sad. eating less because you don’t have the same appetite as you used to. 

feeling incomplete and disconnected as you go thru your everyday life.

gradual isolation cause no one understands you and you’re alone.

i describe it as a fog that surrounds just me. sometimes, it’s clearer and sometimes it’s too dark. but it’s always there and it separates you from other people."
