The one person that has never given up on me or left me to fend for myself, and the only person I know for certain will never stop trying to help me.

Second, fear that the attempt will be unsuccessful and that I will end up in the legalized prison of forced hospitalization. Waking up after I thought I was finally ending it would be unbearable, and I would become first a prisoner of the state and then a prisoner of my own home, stripped of humanity, watched like a hawk, less like a person than ever.

I'm really tired of doing the right things and pushing myself and feeling somewhat okay some of the time, and then having it all fall apart again. I'm not suicidal because I couldn't bring myself to do that to my mom and I've already put her through way too much strife. A lot of my depressed friends have been hospitalized on attempts multiple times even after they've made a lot of improvement, and it doesn't give me much hope.
