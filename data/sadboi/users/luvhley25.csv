I had the same issue as u, we met and then he got distant. He would text me, but it would be hours and hours after I replied when just two days before he was pretty constant with the texts.

rutgers,fpwwmyp,t1_fpwwiq6,1588971319.0,I’m actually not sure I’m really surprised I got it this early bc the email said wait 2 weeks before a decision but I was emailing the coordinator of the cares program so maybe she put mine on priority? I’m not sure
AskAstrologers,fpww52j,t1_fpwv67g,1588971063.0,I think that is what I found!!!! They just didn’t look how I would expect them too
AskAstrologers,fpwu7sn,t1_fpwnoxq,1588970060.0,Thank u for the step by step! I got to the simple chart delineation but For some reason I didn’t see any tables but I did a ctrl F search for power rank and it did put Scorpio as ranked 1 with 14.8 percent..... does that sound right? Followed by Aquarius at 12.9 percent and Aries at 11.4

rutgers,fpwfbme,t1_fpwew3i,1588962448.0,Np! I’m surprised it’s already here because the email said 2 weeks but maybe because I was in touch with the coordinator it was put on priority?
rutgers,fpwe9qk,t1_fpwe3sc,1588961922.0,Yes and I think the first time didn’t count because the coordinator of the CARES department emailed me and said it wasn’t there or something. I did it before it was announced so maybe it was a dead link or something I’m not really sure

AskAstrologers,fpwa5qn,t3_gfq6r7,1588959883.0,"Can someone help me figure out what mine is? I checked my chart and everything is a different sign, I only have Scorpio twice and every other sign is represented only once. So maybe I don’t have a dominant planet?"
RutgersNewark,fpw77fa,t3_gfjbp9,1588958447.0,I got an email this morning and my FA letter has the CARES act $500 and an “emergency fund” amount of 1000. I was surprised bc I thought they said it’d take two weeks for an answer
rutgers,fpvxz2u,t1_fpvtphw,1588953837.0,"Thank u for ur help!!!! I hope so too because I’m nervous about getting checks in the mail, I’ve moved since I applied to Rutgers and although I’ve updated my address to them some documents still go to my old address"
