depressed,esjjxza,t3_c81ncn,1562034806.0,i depend on grilled cheese. also toast with peanut/almond butter and bananas. for later in the day i would recommend rice and beans. i usually use instant rice so it doesn’t require much effort. i just mix it with the beans and maybe some precut vegetables on the stove for a couple minutes and then it’s done. it’s also easy to make a lot of so you can have left over for a couple days. hope this helps

SuicideWatch,es59nu2,t3_c5v6rp,1561605151.0,"you’re really brave to have written this all out, i’m proud of you. we all are. know that you have no responsibility to feel guilty about the kid. it was his decision, and you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. but then again, if you had not witnessed that moment, you probably would not have posted this, meaning all these people on here would not be reading this right now, finding a little hope in the knowledge that they are not alone. traumatic things happen, but try to look at this as a furthering of your empathy and ability to reach other people who are fighting their minds. in dealing with traumatic events of my past, i’ve learned that not talking about it and keeping everything inside will lead to much worse future consequences. thus, i think it’s important that you try to find catharsis through something - it can be anything really, writing, drawing, music, running, to name a few. i’ve found that directing the energy you spend recalling traumatic events toward something that can bring you happiness is incredibly uplifting. you’ve got this. take it slow and continue reaching out on here, there’s a lot of good people to talk to. i believe in you

i would also recommend group therapy. it helped me a lot with things, and it is probably a lot less expensive than individual sessions. another thing that may help is EA meetings. i attended some NA meetings a little while ago with some friends and although i wasn’t there for drug addiction, it really helped just hearing everyone’s stories and struggles and milestones - addiction and depression go hand in hand. but EA meetings may be more for you. just a thought"
