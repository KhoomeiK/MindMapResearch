Self worth and self confidence was based on my grades, and soon grades were really addicting. Getting good grades were the only things that made me happy, it gave me some sort of high. Getting bad grades were the polar opposite. It just became a cycle of depression and suicidal thoughts.

Then, he brings dooku in as his own apprentice to build up the separatist movement. Then a Jedi master, Sifo dyas, commissioned the production of clones for this war. He was murdered by dooku and clone production was controlled by dooku and palpatine (so they could put the inhibitor chips). Palpatine used dooku to bring more systems into the separatist movement, causing the republic to panic and give palpatine emergency powers. Now that the galaxy is destabilized, palpatine issues order 66 and sends Vader to wipe out the separatist council, effectively ending the clone wars. So now palpatine has an entire army at his command and tons of people who support him and his new empire."
