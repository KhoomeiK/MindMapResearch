ethicalfashion,fdqq9jh,t3_emlvyf,1578672559.0,"You could always commission something from a local dressmaker? Find pictures of what you like and ask for it in the materials ou want (e.g. cotton instead of polyester) 
Its expensive in comparison to fast fashion,  but it means the person making your clothes earns a living wage. Also the benefit of a perfect fit :)"
offmychest,fbxkbvb,t3_dne23z,1577191506.0,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear you're going through such a horrible situation. 
I just wanted to say that I have never related to something so much, except it's my Dad not husband.  
It's very horrible to be living in a household where you have no say and are not respected. Where you have to consider every little thing you do and always expect to be criticised or patronised. 
You deserve respect and are not wrong in asking for it. There isn't just one right way of doing things and its ok not to be the way you are expected to be. 
I wonder what made him change so quickly, it sounds like he is unhappy with himself (being so sensitive, even if he doesn't think he is). I'm being the devil's advocate here but maybe once you have spoken to a therapist and the situation has cooled to a point where you can talk, maybe ask him how he is doing and what he is frustrated about? Maybe if you understand where this is all coming from then that would help to give you a bit of emotional closure/clarity. He could be frustrated because he wanted his life to be different, or maybe its something from the past that's come back to bite. Whatever it is he is still responsible for his own actions which have been unacceptable, especially with children around.  
Please look after yourself and know that you deserve love and respect. You are capable and cannot be told otherwise. If you are in a toxic situation please get out of it, the children can see it and feel it, I would know. Best wishes x"
Anxiety,f9so661,t3_e6r4pm,1575596502.0,"I can relate, I was told to try to stop apologising at work by pretty much everyone. 

Try to be open and tell him what you said in the first paragraph. 
> I just feel like I’m being a burden. I feel like I must be hard to listen to sometimes. I feel like it’s not easy to listen to me cry and I don’t like making things worse for people by being around.

The key words being ""feel"" as that is your experience of the situation regardless of how others see it. 

Sometimes I  feel like I just want to apologise and explain why I'm acting the way I am to everyone but it's just not practical or socially appropriate to do it most of the time. I guess the answer is to just own it and be ok with not being perfect in every situation, there are lots of people who say/do stupid things all the time and it doesn't eat them from the inside. But idk as anxiety isn't something you can shove to the side and ""get on with it"", I think mutual understanding helps though.

I hope that's helpful,  if not then relatable."
Edinburgh,ewt48a7,t3_cow36h,1565740031.0,When I was (really) little I used to eat the bus tickets my mum handed to me on the bus and the only time I have a vaig memory of an inspector was one of those times. My mum had to confirm she bought them with the driver.

Anxiety,euvq7v3,t3_chl6gx,1564064207.0,"I'm the same, especially with FB messages and the fear of getting an odd or offended response.

The goal is to be able to say what you want and not care how others react or what they think. To just unapologetically have an opinion and to agree to disagree without anxiety. 

It's ok to not be there yet (I'm certainly not!) there's no hurry. I'm proud of you for challenging yourself and making this post!"

Anxiety,err4ts3,t3_c38tyu,1561160292.0,"I'm currently struggling with this too! I leave messages from people that I really care about because replying is just too much. I hate the 'read' notification on Facebook, it gives me performance anxiety as I know they're looking to see if I've read it or not and if I'll respond. It makes me not want to open it at all. So I don't. 
I can't even send important emails I need to be sending so I don't fail University.
It's reassuring to know it's not just me. 
It's all about those baby steps. Maybe answer one person when they're offline and then start to open up about why you seem so distant?"

I now have several of my own and take them with me when I visit home!"
