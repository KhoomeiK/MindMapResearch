AskReddit,fh203rx,t3_f14f3a,1581229691.0,"Definitely the hard and traumatic ending of my abusive childhood.

I had to leave my friends, country, and about two years of my music career in order to get away from my narcissistic abusive Mother and be off of my cocaine fiend sexually abusive Fathers radar. I had to leave ASAP. I was at the peak of wanting to end my life, and I just couldn't take it all anymore. So I packed one suitcase, taken my phone and iPad, a small handluggage full of essentials, and left to live with my fianc√© where I could finally be safe. 

I don‚Äôt regret leaving, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But being a Brit who moved to Germany, things can sometimes get lonely, overwhelming, and scary. 

Especially as I came from a pretty sheltered, overly coddled, and conspiracy indoctrinated upbringing with little to no life skills and a plethora of mental illnesses stemming from over 22 years of abuse. 

I have Fibromyalgia due to the trauma, and was diagnosed pretty late with Aspergers because my mother never taken me to get evaluated even when several doctors, a school counsillor, and two school principals told her she should of, and was later diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II in my early adult life.

I am still trying to learn German, but I am just simply too damaged from everything that happened to me to remember or absorb anymore information, which scares me shitless. Because my usually quick learning mind has become a chemically imbalanced mush. I still continue to try, and try, and try again, and over time its getting a little easier with healing and time, but I can feel the impatience in my new circle, and its really crushing.

I have an amazing fianc√© who has done so much for me its almost unbelievable, amazing new friends, a beautiful apartment close to Bremen city, with literally access to everything and anything right outside my door. Yet, due to my insecurity, progressing chronic pain, and lack of independence, I can‚Äôt even make it out of the front door to go to the store on my own anymore without the fear of either collapsing from pain, to someone trying to initiate any form of conversation with me in public without getting anxious.

I can only make music from my iPad because my mother will not send over any of my music equipment and PC, to make matters worse, I am quickly losing everything I have earned through my work including customers and fans. So I have to literally work overtime more than usual, which makes me more anxious, which gets me less sleep, which puts pressure on my social life in general, etc...

My relationship is beautiful. My in laws to be love me like their own. I have two hamsters and a cat.  A semi-comfortable situation monetarily (Some months are harder than others.) and my wounds are starting to heal. When I do actually go outside, I go with my fianc√© mostly, and make the most of it and to try and get use to this completely new world so that one day I can do everything on my own again.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean I am okay yet. I still feel like the world is closing in on me. Time is running out. I am 24 and have no direction. I fear that one day my fianc√© will just lose it and not love me anymore due to my taxing physical disability, mental illnesses, and my helicopter mother trying to make our lives hell (Even though he swears that everything is okay.). I fear I will be closed in another set of four walls, sheltered away, alone, to never see another face again. 

This is what abuse that doesn‚Äôt get recognised or justice does to the victim. It destroys them. Just like how it destroyed me. Trying to 'shake the victim awake' doesn't do anything after a decade or more of the abuse, it becomes more like trying to resuscitate them from the grave their abusers dug and buried them into.


In conclusion: The worst thing I ever did in my life, was not get away from my situation sooner whilst I was still young and had a chance of redemption. 

Things would have been alot easier and I would have been more prepared and ready for the adult years to come. Its been nearly three years of being in Germany, and it is slowly but surely getting better, but I wish I knew how hard it was to adapt after catapulting myself into a new world with no plan, money, or direction. Please plan before you run unless your life truly depends on it people, or adapting will be slow, painful, and pretty nerve wrecking.

Tbh, if it wasn‚Äôt for my fianc√©, I would have committed suicide long ago."

Probably the hardest, and most saddest unsubscribe was Eddsworld. I understand that Matt is having difficulty with releasing an episode, but its just nothing but false promises at this point, and I feel Eddsworld needs to just stop from where it currently is. 

The fandom is cringe, the family are stuck because of the lack of animator and team to lean on, and its just unfair to keep beating a dead horse for the sake of Edds legacy. 

Personally, I feel the fans do not deserve anymore, because of how horrible they are/have been since the end of the legacy. 

One of them pretended to have Edds cancer (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia)  on Amino (A social network app for mostly fandoms.) and Matt was going to go out of his way to visit this person, only for the parents to confirm that this was all a hoax. 

Several harrassed Paul Ter Voorde (The previous animator) and Pat  (A high tier donater to the shows legacy fund.) all because a fucking shipping joke Tom Ridgewell made with them on Twitter that was taken way out of proportion. It taken all three of them to make lengthy posts just to tell the fandom that it was a joke and not canon, and that this was affecting their careers due to search results being tainted by the fandom and their fanart and fanpages. One of them even made a Celeb Birthdays page about Pat, getting all information incorrect, which could of heavily affected his chance of working in professional animation. 

Oh, and lets not forget how the fandom basically scared a main characters voice actor (Tord Larsson) away due to the dick hungry weebs on Newgrounds trying to track his address or harass him, he had to change his identity entirely and has now just disappeared entirely from the internet (As far as we know.)

You can also cremate your hamster from the comfort of your own home.

Throw in some flowers, treats, their favourite toy, bring some friends to remember your fluff, nobody is going to judge you for greiving over your hamster.

If you somehow could afford it, you could get her freeze dried, taxidermied, buried in a pet cemetary, or let the vet dispose of your pets body cleanly and with respect.

Don't dumb them down and not let them be internetwise, but at the same time, monitor according to their age, and don't try to fight them when they eventually find loopholes in your parental control later down the line. 

When I was between 3-10, I wasn't even allowed online for more than 30 minutes a day, and only select websites could be accessed. I was taught what not to do and what I could do online, and was encouraged to go out and play BEFORE going online. I use to just play DX Ball 2, Toxic Bunny, and DOOM, before browsing the Nickolodeon website or Funnyjunk briefly, it wasnt like they had to be worried.

But oh boy as I got older was I eager to learn how to bypass my parental control curfew. It got to the point where I would research ways to 'hack ur moms pw' on Google. 

After that, and when I started high school, my Mum couldn't monitor me anymore due to my new found freedom and a sneaky little trick, and thanks to finding out how to get past the family admin accounts password through command prompt, I could change the parental control settings. My Mum, had no idea what the hell a command prompt was, so this just made me feel super sneaky.

insaneparents,eyccz2d,t1_eycbfmn,1567000104.0,"What my Dad did was unforgivable, unforgettable and something that will follow me every single day for the rest of my life. I remember the smell of his breath, the texture of my bedsheets, the ringing in my ear from his cursing and his drunken state. I didn't know what he was doing to me, all I knew was that this was hurting, he tied me down, and he was trying to kill me.

It taken me a year to tell my Mom, but three years until she actually tried to take action legally.
As expected, no justice was served. I only got a 12 month restraining order against him, and he still walks a free man.

Rape victims never truly 'recover', no matter how much it hurt, how long ago it was, or how many people you have to hug in order to remove his touch from my skin... I had stars in my eyes for my Dad, until he did what he did.

My Mom is losing herself. Slowly, painfully, and tragically. She is feeling the karma of her actions unlike my Father, but she still doesnt acknowledge my existence without talking about her conspiracy rants..and how me chosing to be Jewish is evil and disgusting."
AskReddit,eyagj51,t3_cfrz1m,1566963052.0,"UPDATE: Just forgot to add some things that my friend reminded me of when I brought up Bonnie, also a couple of important details I missed out. 

1. She didn't just get Aiesha in trouble, she got our other friend in trouble too for the exact same reason. Running away and taking advantage of a free sleepover before the police did yet another 4 o'clock knock to get her back to her foster home. I wouldn't be surprised if she did this to multiple people aswell and possibly got them in heaps of trouble.

2. She owes Aiesha money as well. And from what I have been told, she hasn't even paid her back either.

3. Her foster parents were completely stressed out from Bonnie's constant bad behaviour and risky behaviour. Their strictness was in no way, shape, or form; unjustified. Bonnie was a huge problem when it came down to authority, responsibility, and discipline.

4. After she graduated, she lost both of her biological parents by then to illnesses caused and elevated by their multiple addictions. Which is really tragic..

5. Her older sister actually talked to me on BBM when I got my Blackberry unblocked and activated again. I told her about what Bonnie did and what happened, and she even agreed that what she did was a really shitty thing and that she would scold her for it, probably why Bonnie started avoiding me after that.

6. She started becoming a huge bully to alot of people, mostly to those that were close to me, Aiesha, and some other girls, and today she has apparently still the same attitude as she did years ago about me, when all I ever did was treat her with kindness, empathy, understanding, generosity and respect.

7. Yes, her life was rough. But that doesn't justify stealing, bullying, throwing people 'under the bus' when she doesnt get her way, and getting people into all kinds of the potentially risky behaviour she gets herself into. I learnt by the time I broke off our friendship that she was really just taking my friendship as both a pity party, and her financial/materialistic gain when she couldnt get that herself.

And finally, *I was a kid back then.* I had no clue what she was doing to me until she had the nerve to steal from me."

insaneparents,ex2bna7,t3_cpuxk8,1565966447.0,"My Dad (who is a huge cokehead) raped me in 2005, days before my 10th birthday. He physically abused me and neglected me almost daily up until me and my Mum packed up and literally ran away with me from him across the country (From London, to Bristol) he was also a Nazi sympathizer (Even though his family is Jewish.), a pathological liar, and was violent towards his mother (who sucks up to his defense)  I haven't seen him since what he had done to me..

My Mum is a huge catholic, thinks she is multiple different Gods, addicted to opiates, is emotionally and narcissistically abusive, sheltered me away from absolutely everything, and blames me for her divorce, her mother passing away, her disabilities and her inability to take responsibility for her own mistakes.
She uses the excuse that she saved my life when I was 10 and that she never did any wrong in her life.

There was just no escaping the abuse until I moved to Germany in 2018. I now dont see my mother ever again either.

Luckily I am vaccinated before my Mother joined the Anti Vax club. She also joined the anti climate change groups, David Icke crazy, believes in aliens and reptilians, has only just been diagnosed with schitzophrenia and refused to take her meds from time to time.

I am okay now. Just healing and trying to live on as normal. Easier said than done, but I am strong enough to not look back, I am safe and loved by a fianc√©, his parents and my new friends. Sometimes suicidal thoughts for weeks on end happen, but I am too anxious to even go past self harm. Its not like its a first attempt either, I attempted 13 times to end my life throughout my life...I havent attempted suicide in a year, clean from self harm for 2 years and slowly but surely sealing the scars up.

Stay strong everyone."
