mentalillness,fiuvdak,t3_f9skeb,1582748954.0,"23F; ADHD + depression + anxiety 

Always struggled with concentration, but I figured everybody felt like that. Developed depression and anxiety late in elementary school, probably related to untreated ADHD plus bad school environment.

It got worse in middle school, but I never told anyone. In high school I really startet struggling with concentration, and I believed I was just to dumb and didn't deserve better. Anxiety got worse too.

I finally told my mom about my anxiety, but nothing more, as I didn't want to make her worried. Still didn't go to therapy or use any medications.

Startet at the university, and things got really bad. I was living 3-4 hours away from my family and friends, in a new town. Isolated myself, stopped eating, and started experiencing suicidal thoughts. 

I finally told my boyfriend and parents, and they contacted a doctor, who sent me to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. It took some time, and I got worse before I got better again. Startet planning my suicide, and had a written plan with a date. Also started self-harming.

It took a year before I got the ADHD-diagnosis, and startet medication for it. Got therapy for another year before I was considered as ""treated"". I finish my degree this summer, and I'm a lot better now."
