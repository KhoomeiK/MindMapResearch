I also know of a guy who knew how to get into the steeple. In the building we were in there was a door that led into the ceiling which had a catwalk above the chapel to change out the lights, etc. This catwalk ended in the steeple where all you could do was just look out the side slats. And this was an old lds building too. But it still had the modern design you see today. Last I heard, they built them so you don't need to go into the ceiling anymore. Now they just use ladders and other means of getting to them. But I did hear of a rumor that there is an entrance in every building through a ceiling door of some sort.

Second, what are your intentions for joining? That will determine a lot of things and whether or not you will be allowed in.

Third, you may want to proofread what you've written and either A) check it before you submit the post or B) Edit it after proofreading. It's a little hard to understand the details of your main post.

Fourth, there is the FLDS church too. They didn't think the LDS church was true after Joseph Smith either.



But the way to do it is to get in contact with your bishop or the missionaries. They will deem whether you're ready to become a member or not. That is, of course only on the condition that you have been excommunicated or taken off of the records. If however you just quit going to church, then your records are wherever you last attended church regularly. To get them transferred, you would either need to talk to the bishop of your local ward. Or to the bishop of the ward that you regularly attended. If you do not have their numbers, you can contact them through the lds tools app. As long as you have your membership number (which can be found on your temple recommend) it will show you their numbers so that you can contact them. Keep in mind, bishops rotate out every 6 years or less. Good luck in your efforts."

elderscrollsonline,flqajy4,t3_fq6xk1,1585386254.0,"If you want to get the most out of mid-end game, you'll want to join the Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, and Undaunted Guilds immediately. They will level up automatically as you fight and get you some great stats and exp. You can even put abilities you don't use into your ability bar and they will level up without you even having to use them. (This is great for later when you want to experiment with different attacks to see which is better.)

Also, collect EVERYTHING! The sooner you do so, the more you can do with crafting, etc. Be sure to do the crafters writs every day to get a ton of gold. It took me about a week to level up the crafters writs and its already making a big difference in my gameplay. You can take anything you don't want to carry and visit a town bank to deposit it if you wish.

Don't worry about buying armor and weapons until you hit level 50 or 160. That's when things become important. But just enjoy it until then. Save your gold for things like your bank space and your horse. Definitely save up for the horse first. It's 10k gold and after you buy it, you will want to start putting gold towards its skills immediately. It will allow you to carry more items, ride faster, and allow you to take more hits before falling off your horse. And horses are FAST. A horse should be one of your top priorities if not the top. It takes almost one entire real world day to train it to 1 skill point.

If you want to kill enemies quickly, try to focus on getting either your spell criticals or your weapon criticals high. Don't focus on both or your character won't deal good damage. Just one or the other, experiment with it to get a feel for what you want. And be sure you put things toward stamina recovery or magicka recovery to keep yourself busy during a fight. Otherwise, you will be waiting for things to recharge before you can land a powerful attack.

In order to get exp in crafting, you will want to deconstruct items that have white names and ""intricate"" labels this will allow you to make some decent things later and allow you to keep up with crafting writs. And be sure to research traits at crafting stations when possible. Later it can take up to a real world month to research a trait.

Keep in mind, the most important thing, is to HAVE FUN! But following these will allow you to have more fun while avoiding grinding and farming too much. You don't have to follow this if you don't want to either, but it will save you the monotony of trying to level things up later when you realize you really wanted something. This is true particularly when it comes to owning a house and decorating it. Each crafting station has unique items each station can craft for your home. If you want cool and convenient things all in one place, a home is crucial. But some people are fine without homes. That's where a lot of the materials come into play. If however, you decide you don't want them, you can always sell them for money later.

One last tip. Go into social, and go to the guilds section. You will want to find good guilds with lots of members. You can have 5 in total. I would recommend finding one that is active and will help newbies out, especially when it comes to quests and group dungeons. Having friends will help you knock out monotonous and difficult things. Two I really like are [Keepers of The Heartlands] and [Merchants For Better Homes] they are nice and very helpful. Their homes also have some really good perks for crafting, etc. I would also suggest a guild that allows you to pull from a guild bank for free without any strings attached, this will help you get good items when needed without having to pay 10k gold or 50k gold for dues, which no newbie can afford. I am a part of [GentlemanBasterds] which has a bank just like that, and I can often use or sell the items banked there for gold. Just be sure to contribute and put something back in every once in a while, if you decide to join. You can apply for a guild or leave it at any time. I never had a guild when I first started and the guild I got was trash. Now that the game has a Guild Finder option, it is cake to find a good posse to get help with. Don't get nervous about joining a guild either. There is no pressure and you just be as active as you want.

Have fun and feel free to message me if you want!"

Comaradeswitch, I think you just broke my brain, my friend.

As for my character. I'm running a Khajiiti Nightblade. He heals pretty good and a rarely see any teamates in dungeons go down. But his dps is garbage. Just did the Mundus Stone thing, and I'm already seeing a drastic improvement! My swings to kill got reduced by about 25% So instead of taking about 20 attacks to down an oponent, it's been knocked down to around 14. Using a lot of Stamina abilities to attack. All my healing comes from those, Sanguine Altar and Soul Thread (Ultimate). I just bought some gear about a week ago to put more into healing and it does the trick, but I just overheard someone talking about crits and thought I should look into it. This gives me a good idea of where to go.

I was just advised on how to structure my gear a couple of days ago. So I think I'll be ditching my healing gear or maybe another to try and beef up my crits."

Therefore I haven't prioritized Magicka recovery like I have health and Stamina. Oddly enough, I'm surprised that my Magicka Recovery is even at 700.

I prefer melee. I use a bow only when I can't handle being close to an enemy. I can't spend much time on eso so I would rather stick to the weapons I have leveled up. I don't really care about PvP or PvE so I have nothing in regards to Crit Resistance (242).

The only thing I could add is this... Gods' commandments and expectations have been fairly unifrom since the beginning of man. As time went on, more things happened such as murder. He then had to step up the rules at some points to get people to understand that what they were doing wasn't what he created it for. These rules (commandments) serve one purpose, to make things easier on us. Generally speaking, you have a lot less problems if you don't steal, cheat, or murder, etc. And you spread less problems as a result.

On the topic of political/controversial stances. I've had friends who have left their religions on the belief that churches should get with the times. (Or be modernized to todays' society.) Some have. But the others that don't, do it because they believe that Gods commandments are the same as when he said them years ago. He said it, therefore he means it.

He claimed it said so in the bible. The second was Harold Camping. He predicted that the world would end twice. Both times he was flat dead wrong. It says so in the bible and the BOM that no one knows when that day will be nor the angels which are in heaven.

I would be wary of people who claim to know a future date of when something cataclysmic will happen. Even the prophets in the past never truly knew which day something would occur.

I'd suggest doing that. If it doesn't happen, don't worry about it. The mission is basically a way for young men to grow up fast. My Mission President said that it is just a preparation for life. It has a way of waking you up spiritually as well as responsibly, because you get to do big things and see the consequences of your actions. Some people go onto the mission just to be tested to their limit and sometimes lose their faith because of it. This is mainly due to their faith being placed in people or insignificant things. As long as you have initiative and your testimony is solid, you really don't have to experience the mission imo. One could say that the mission is the refiners fire that will test your faith and endurance. A way to gauge where you stand and how you will react given certain situations. But if worse comes to worse, you can always serve as an Senior Missionary or even a Ward Mission Leader. There are even Service Missionaries who serve missions with permission from their Bishop/Stake President.

The main thing most missionaries take from their missions, is that missionary work never truly ends. It's all about how much you are willing to sacrifice, give, and do, to do the Lord's work. Members are the best resources the missionaries have for finding new people and baptising them. There is no resource more powerful. Be the best member you can be, and the missionaries will always have an awesome person to lean on. And heaven knows they need them. I'd do that. But don't burn yourself out. Too much dedication can lead to irritability, impatience, and depression, when coupled with other peoples naievity and ignorance.

Unless you really want to listen to Moses and wander the desert for 40 years. I mean, that's definitely an option. But ultimately he was what they needed right then and there. The problems of this day and age are different than in the times of Lorenzo Snow.

You'd be lucky to spend only 30 seconds alive and regretting your decision. Hollywood makes it look quick, and painless. But the human body is really good at keeping itself alive.

If you want help with the church tho, I can probably help with that. I had a time where I couldn't believe what the church said, my buddies were all leaving it, but for some reason I couldn't bring myself to leave. My sister finally came back from her mission and asked what my problem was. I told her how much I hated hypocrites in the church, how some doctrines didn't seem to jive, and I felt like everything I was taught was a lie. She then gave me a look and said, ""I didn't know you were thinking about all this. It seems to me you are thinking too much."" I said, ""yeah, but doesn't change how I feel"" She told me, ""You know what? I think you're putting too much faith in people. And things too."" I asked her what she meant. She then quoted a scripture. Christs' words. It said ""Wherefore do not put your faith in the arm of the flesh, but put your faith in God, who is the same yesterday, today  and forever."" (Or at least something to that effect. That's how I percieved it.) And that solved a lot of my problems for me. I quit caring about deep doctrine and I couldn't give a crap if someone isn't living up to their standards now. Because they are gonna do whatever they are gonna do, and I have no right to force them. Besides, I've got enough to worry about just focussing on my own salvation.

But take it from a guy who has had a grandpa that went on his own excavations to find evidence of the book of mormon. You can search for the brass plates or the liahona or whatever until you pass out, if you think that that is what your faith has to be built on. But I can tell you one thing. God wouldn't give us faith and have us practice with it if he thought that it wasn't worthwhile. But my grandad become a old stubborn, bitter old coot that wound up having his children piss and dance on his grave. Theres more to this world than physical things and evidence. And that goes for facts too. I'd say that History books are 100% correct about 30% of the time. And this is coming from a history buff. Some things require more than facts and evidence. Some things require testimonials, emotions, and spiritual fitness (endurance) to put things into an accurate light. That's why jurys and trials can't rely on facts and evidence alone. Someone has to have been there, a witness to be able to tell the story. Otherwise it's just speculation. You gotta pay attention to how people act, get multiple unbiased points of view and make your own verdict.

I always use the same routes. Gotta touch stuff or it will bug me to no end, sometimes almost to the point of ocd.
I zone out, it just feels so good, but it takes an effort to snap back. Whenever I get overwhelmed, my body just has to let the energy out, be it hitting something, pulling hair, or slapping head. Gotta have scripted lines I've memorized to get me out of awkward social situations, because sometimes I can't be social, no matter what I do. The biggest problem is the eye contact. It feels gross and rude. I have to make a substantial effort to try and make eye contact with people, and sometimes its too uncomfortable. I feel like I'm going to jump out of my skin and it becomes reflexive. My eyes dart away even if I am trying.

Pretty sure I've got it too. But I'm 29, not sure what a doc could do for me now. Been using workarounds my whole life and so far so good. 🤷‍♂️  But if you need to do it, go for it!

mormon,fflph89,t1_ffk502c,1580042466.0,"For me, I try to remember when he has played a part in my life. And depending on what I did or how I reacted, it had a noticeable effect on how things played out. Has there ever been a time that you have recieved an answer from God? Try to think of all the times something shouldn't have gone right, and did. Those are all ways of knowing that he is still keeping an eye on you. Even if he may seem distant.

As for your second paragraph, that is what I meant by worrying about yourself. To elaborate, people get focussed in lots of things in the church materials. Doctrine, hypocrisy, history, geography, syntax, translations, the list goes on and on. That's great and all, but realize that you are basing your judgements on other people and their perceptions, their lives, and mistakes. The important thing is to know where YOU sit with God. Sure, if you think that you can't be a member, then do what you feel is right. But I find that members get all jumbled up in factoids, knowledge, super deep doctrine, teeny tiny minute details that usually have nothing to do with the gospel at all. (For example some idiots got into a tizzy at church about what ""My father dwelt in a tent"" meant just this past sunday. What does that have to do with spirituality, the gospel, or the afterlife?) Christs' doctrine is simple at its core. And if you focus on that, then that's all you need.

But everyone is different. My Grandpa needed physical tangible evidence for every single thing the church threw at him. He spent probably millions of dollars trying to find that evidence, to no avail. He kept getting hung up on the land masses where the BOM took place, and couldn't stand the thought of not having brass plates around. To the point where he became stubborn and bitter and wound up not fully believing it. In the end, he gave up living the gospel because he refused to base his testimony on faith, and those that knew him (members or not) wanted to dance and piss on his grave when he died. That's what I mean by focus on what's important to you. Not just you, but those you care about as well.

I do not say this to compare my grandpa to you. I don't know you, how you think, or what it is you are hoping to find. But I hope you find it. I'm just using my grandpa as an example because he was a very unique and bizarre individual, but was human and was plagued by something I see in the majority of church members. The desire to know that something is real. And I can tell you firsthand, Christ wouldn't teach about faith if he didn't want you to exercise it. And why am I bringing up faith so much? Because at one point I got so frustrated and hung up on a-holes in the church that I wound up burning myself out of it for a while. It wasn't until I talked to my sister about it that made me see things in a bigger perspective. In her words, ""It seems to me that you are putting your faith in the people around you. Christ says not to put your faith in the arm of the flesh, but in him who is perfect and will not lead you astray."" I'm not sure if that is the correct scriptural wording, but that is exactly what my sister said. And she was right. I was focusing on what everybody else was doing wrong and they were pissing me off! I quit attending church, I hated activities, up until I had that talk with my sister. Now, it doesn't phase me what people think about me, or what they do, because I know I'm doing what I need to do, others be darned. And I've seen enough divine evidence in my life to the point I know God wants me here and in this church. But like I said, everyone is different. As is each relationship with God. The best Christians I know are ones that left their churches to find out what other churches taught, they put their findings together and lived as Christians even if they didn't always belong to a church. (One guy I met had belonged to 7 different churches when I met him) But these people still continuously search and attend because they know that is where they will be edified, that is where they will learn. And honestly, I think a lot of people could learn something from that kind of dedication to God."
mormon,ffk31oh,t1_ffig5z2,1580014272.0,"That or stick it out. Ultimately it's your choice.

The alternative is to figure out what parts of your testimony need strength and find the answers to the questions your testimony needs answers to. Basically, just some soul searching. However, the most common reason I have seen (and experienced myself) where people get twisted up about the church, is people expecting people to behave a certain way in the church, and if that particular person(s) doesn't see that happen, then they get turned off. The reality of it is that people get the gospel confused with the people. Somewhere they believe that the church is the people. When in reality people are gonna do whatever the heck they are gonna do. What's important is how you feel about your relationship with the Lord. Do you feel you are right with the Lord? Do you feel that you are not doing enough? If you feel that you are lacking in some way, then only you can change how you feel about that. You can either avoid it or charge it head on. But living with that feeling day to day will eat at you until eventually it will come to a head.

In short, if your concerns come from worrying about how others are living the gospel, just worry about your yourself. You've got enough to worry about anyway. But if it's not that, or rather, you are having trouble adhering to the standards of the church and don't feel like you can do that, then you need to do what you need to do to help you be okay with yourself and sleep at night. Either way, the priority is you. What do YOU want? And what do YOU want to accomplish?"
mormon,ffhu1wf,t3_eto7by,1579953892.0,"So the lds faith is pretty strict. It's good, but it's not for everyone. I say if it's doing you more harm than good, you should find another religion.

Personally, I would weigh the pros and cons. Make a list of things I could live with and things I couldn't live without. That will help you make a decision.

If you tell them, expect to lose a bunch of friends. When you tell one, all the others find out eventually, either from that friend(s), or by your actions. Keep in mind, giving up those standards will alienate you from them because they want to keep adhering to their standards. Their parents will also take note of it and make sure that their children aren't being influenced in that way either. Lump sum, you will lose connections fairly fast. It all depends on whether or not you want to keep them. The friends who are very open-minded and level-headed will stay in touch, but any others are unreliable. Even if you have deep close connections with someone there is a good chance that you will lose that connection with that person. It all depends on what you can handle and if you are willing to makes changes or sacrifices to get what you want.

That said. Churches are just like any club (not the party or weapon kinds). If you don't follow the rules, or have disimilar goals or standards in mind, then people will be wary about having you as part of the club. But there are also benefits to being in the club. Humans are very tribal creatures. You just need to decide if you want to belong to that tribe/club.

If you are younger than 18 I would say to wait until you are 18 before you leave. This is when you will see people leaving the church and you will have a better understanding of church doctrines/principles and can make a better judgement call. If you end up leaving, you will at least have some people to sympathize with when they leave, and you won't be as confused or lonely. You also won't have to worry about the mission, and people will be moving around that time and people get lost in the mix. I had a friend who did it this way and moved, she avoided all the complexities, emotional drama, and fallout."

depression,ff8jv8q,t3_es7cc3,1579681907.0,"Yes this is actually a thing. Humans don't like negative things, so they usually stay away from anything that makes them uncomfortable. In this case, it's a person. Don't take that the wrong way tho. The fact that they are still hanging out with you is a very good thing. If they didn't like you, they wouldn't be in your life, period. So kudos! You gots fwends!

On another note, it sounds like you feel anxiety when you talk to people, and you are pretty sensitive about what others say. You might want to ask your therapist if you have Aspergers syndrome. This is pretty common and I actually feel the same things you do. To the point where I have to memorize phrases whenever the conversation gets awkward to move the conversation along. A telltale sign is if it is hard to make eye contact with people. For me it feels SUPER uncomfortable and rude, and it sucks cuz most people use eye contact as a sign of trust.

As for sensitivity, sometimes the tiniest things people say or do will keep me from sleeping at night. That changed once I got immersed into the world of felons and ex-cons, jerks, deouchebags, etc. It wasn't until people started harrassing me on a daily basis that I grew numb to it. Sometimes hearing that crap over and over makes anything else seem trivial. (For instance, the word ""noob"" used to piss me off. Now I just facepalm and laugh, because I have been called SOOOO much worse!)"
depression,ff8j8e1,t3_es7dsu,1579681013.0,"Been there. I think you might benefit from a thing I used to do. For me, drawing web plots was a good way for me to solve a problem. I put my self or my problem at the center and try to figure out what negative things are connected to it and branch out as far as I can. Then I add an asterik anytime duplicates appear and list them. This helps me to find the connections and what is the root cause of the problem, and generally I am usually able to change something to make it better. Sometimes changing one thing can change all the others too.

It sounds difficult, but I have no set method for figuring this out. I just try to connect dots and 99.9% of the time I learn more about myself than I anticipated. (Also note: This can work in reverse for positive things too.) This works so well, that sometimes I put others in the center and I wind up finding out WAY more than I probably should about them. (Keep in mind this is after years of trial and error, to the point where I now know what data is accurate and what data isn't. Turns out, I can do this and make reasonable predictions about peoples personailities and sometimes even their past and be correct about 70% of the time. It's quite shocking. Be warned, if you get to this point, you will be doing these connections in your head during communiques and it can totally change a conversation or situation you may find yourself in. It's a blessing and a curse.) But mostly, I only put others on the board if I am trying to find out why I am having trouble connecting with them or if I can't stand them for some odd reason. This helps me narrow it down.

If I were you, what I would do is make a list of things that somebody has done for me that I appreciated. Doesn't matter how long ago, just that it happened, and no matter how small. Even the most miniscule thing is important, because humans are tribal creatures and do not waste energy on things they don't like. And if they do, then they are spending that energy to get something out of that person or the local environment. (For instance, someone that hates you, can spend time and effort making you bleed, because seeing you suffer makes them feel good. Or a child doing a chore they hate only because they know that the parents will bring down the doom hammer if they don't.) All things happen for a reason. Might as well find out why.

If you can ingrain that into your routine, you will find yourself taking more risks, but also earning more rewards. Especially in the form of experience and knowledge. That's how they get good at what they do, they fail and find other ways to make things work. [Walt Disney almost went bankrupt building Disneyland and everybody told him it was gonna flop. That includes his family.]

Second: Quit worrying about society. You've got enough on your plate as it is without having to worry about how others are living their lives. (And in reality, they don't give a thought about you, so why should you think about them for days?) Focus on what you need and how to get it rather than dwell on things out of your control. Yeah it can be fun or interesting to get lost in thought, but if it's making you angry or dragging you down, then you need to replace that with something better or productive. If you focus on the negative, that is all you will see, try to change what you see. Attempt to look at things in a positive light repetitively. That will train your brain to look for pros instead on cons, and likewise, you will start to see strengths instead of weaknesses.
