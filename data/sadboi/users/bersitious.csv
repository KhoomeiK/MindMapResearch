Plus it takes forever to win over their trust, I was best friends with mine for almost two years before he felt the same way towards me (he had no clue I was in love with him haha) it’s funny because they are so in tune with people but not at the same time. They are truly such a good pair, they are kind and take time to understand feelings but also pretty good at being the voice of reason when I want to put a slide in the house! And they are organized enough to help me get my life together but not too organized that I drive them nuts! And ENFPs help them relax and have fun but we can also have serious conversations. I feel both ENFPs and INFJs value authenticity so much! But I could fan girl over INFJs forever so I will spare you!"

AskWomen,fph9nq3,t3_gd9j9n,1588617401.0,"It’s a container for my thoughts so I have a safe space to keep them and permission not to overthink things knowing the thoughts are waiting for me when I’m ready. I usually write about:

- Emotional turmoil or good emotions
- Fun things that happened
- Personal growth or something that I learned
- I write at least 3 things I’m grateful for everyday
- Cool or concerning dreams I had
- Prayers or cool teaching I heard 
- letters to people I’m angry with 
- letters to my future/past self
- letters to my current self from my future self in faith the things I write about become true
- Hopes and dreams
- what I talked about in therapy or a helpful conversation with a friend
- And anything else

I love journaling, it helps me stay healthy mentally and it’s a cool way for me to go back and remember something I learned. It’s also really good for me to remember to take care of myself on my good days because it’s so easy to forget the bad days when things are good  if that makes sense."
AskReddit,fpgn9v1,t3_gd9lck,1588605978.0,If it’s an independent contractor position make sure you are allowed to quit if you give enough notice. I live in Canada and almost got sued for breaking my contract with a company.
AskWomen,fpcid10,t3_gcfcab,1588501628.0,"1. I got rid of Instagram 
2. I only looked in the mirror in the morning when I got dressed and when I went to the washroom (not in every window or remotely reflective thing like before)
3. I started doing yoga, it helped me feel like my body was my friend, not my enemy 
4. This may not apply to you but I had developed an eating disorder and in order to eat properly I would pretend I was pregnant 
5. I got kind of into body building which helped me focus on fuelling my body and being strong rather than punishing it. But I can see how that would exacerbate the problem for some people. 
6. SAW A COUNSELLOR 

Your journey will be different and unique, just like you. I would recommend talking to a counsellor, if your in Canada we have access to free program called bounce back which helps you confront your negative thinking and provides ways to overcome it (it’s not like counselling it’s more of self help so it’s good for people who aren’t up for traditional counselling)"

Even when I used to write essays I’d think things through by explaining it to someone in my head or giving a presentation. I’ll be doing it down the streets and my mouth will be moving with the words sometimes and I’ll catch myself and pretend I’m listening to a song or something so people don’t think I’m off the rails

I was about to switch to be an ESL teacher but then I got accepted to my MSW so I’m going to give it another shot. You’re not alone though, it’s a thankless job. Maybe look at a different field like a drop in centre or a hospital before you quit. Your BSW will not be wasted though, it’s a great resource even if you never work as a social worker again."
relationship_advice,fojkll9,t3_g7rf5g,1587823348.0,"If she has commitment issues it’s likely that as much as she doesn’t want to commit to being with one person, she probably doesn’t want to commit to being without that person either. A break could be a non committal break up where she doesn’t have to commit to never being with you. 

Having said that, I understand she might be feeling suffocated and needs some time to figure some shit out without the obligation of being another’s half. I still don’t think breaks are healthy but maybe if you still want to be with her you could explore what she wants out of this break and see if there is a way to give her some space and support within the relationship while still respecting your boundaries."
socialwork,foaags5,t1_fo18fr2,1587643163.0,"Thank you for this, it’s genuinely helpful!"
socialwork,foa9tmk,t3_g5kq0d,1587642766.0,"Not only are you doing the avenue of social work you don’t want but you’re also doing it with the most difficult population to counsel IMHO. With addictions coinciding severe mental health you really need good support. If your manager hasn’t told you I can imagine you’re doing an amazing job having lasted that long and also developed strong enough connections to want to stay. 

I left my job with no backup plan because I was so burnt out, it was impacting my family and friends and my physical health too! So if you’re open to searching for options outside of social work while you start looking for other jobs, you might want to consider that. No job is worth your mental health. There’s leaning into discomfort of a challenging job and there’s a job that causes chronic stress and costs you your health. 

Additionally I would say don’t stay because of your clients. Your clients would move on from treatment if it was their time and wouldn’t stay because of you. You’re replaceable there, you’re not replaceable at home. Plus you don’t owe anyone your happiness and it seems like that’s what your job is costing you. 

Obviously at the end of the day trust yourself, but don’t let feelings of inadequacy rob you from trusting yourself to know what’s serving you. You might not even realize how bad it is until you leave and you start to feel “normal” again. 

Also if you’re in Canada I would recommend checking out Bounce Back. It’s a free program, over the phone and it’s really helpful, even for social workers! I was sceptical but it’s worth a try!"

The thing is, though, ENFPs can really enjoy so many things and be good at them too so it’s pretty open in my opinion.

I went into nursing originally but I think I was just trying to show people I wasn’t this bubbly air head people often mistake ENFPs for.

relationship_advice,f8jpyfj,t3_e0tand,1574603134.0,"I would take some kind of action because human trafficking is more common than you think and this is often how it starts. He’s not going to be as abusive right now as he will be so she might not understand why you did it. As a first step, if you’re more comfortable, you can call a sexual assault centre near by and seek counsel from them. 

I know you’re worried about not being with her at school because she’s mad at you but you definitely won’t be with her if she’s dead. And if it really goes south, it’s hard to see now but know you will make other friends but the trauma of abuse and/or trafficking is not something that goes away after a few cry sessions and some ice cream."
