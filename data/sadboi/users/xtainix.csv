SchittsCreek,fozk3q9,t1_foz29kh,1588191991.0,"Yes, exactly.  It's almost like a utopia.  I believe I read that's how Daniel Levy wanted it to be."
SchittsCreek,foyx1nr,t3_ga8d0a,1588180770.0,"I came out at 19 to extremely conservative republican southern baptists.  I experienced everything from being told I wouldn't spend eternity in heaven with my family, being dis-invited to birthday parties, family get togethers and vacations to being told I wasn't allowed alone in the same room with my younger female cousins.  

Unfortunately, all these things led me to experience extremely tumultuous 20s.  I moved from place to place and person to person trying to find someone to love and accept me.  Trying to find somewhere to call home.  

My mother passed away in 2015 from cancer still believing I was going to hell and that my marriage to my wife was invalid because it was not ordained by god.  My family still has nothing to do with us.

It's been one hell of a fucking journey, but I can tell you that despite all the pain and the suicide attempts and the bullshit, I am as happy as I ever have been.  My wife and I just celebrated out 5 year wedding anniversary.  We have been together a total of 8 years.  

Family bullshit doesn't get better and it's always bittersweet to see most families on tv be so accepting.  It's not fair and it's really fucked up.  They're the people who are supposed to love and accept you unconditionally.  

I cried more than once watching Schitts Creek.  Patrick coming out, their engagement, Patrick serenading David and David lip syncing to Tina Turner.  It highlights our relationships in a 'normal' perspective.  Which is what we are!  We work, shop, have pets and lives just like everyone else.  I feel like the more these shows portray us as such, the further we will move along as a society.  

I truly hope that you can find the courage within you to come out of the closet and be yourself.  Fuck everyone else."

The reaching out to people I shouldn't stopped once I got a little older.  I'm not sure how old you are, but my age has helped me mature some and make better decisions, cut people out of my life, etc.

The way she explained the results was that they place your answers next to everyone that’s ever taken the test before and been diagnosed with specific things.  That’s how they get your answers and diagnoses.  It was crazy how specific it was to my behavior in childhood and presently.  

Hope that helps!"
