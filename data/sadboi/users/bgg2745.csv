BPD,ff602ez,t1_ff3gvq5,1579615628.0,"I have researched BPD from many sources and I am convinced that they describe my ex much too accurately without ever having experienced her. I am amazed at what goes beyond coincidence. Our lives to include my childs have been compromised forever and there is no solution beyond making the best of it. But to deny the facts of these ""general descriptions"" is like denying what I see before my own eyes, and yes social changes of the last 2 decades do have an impact since not only ""manipulation, need for social acceptance, and gullibility"" are part of the picture. I am open to discussion as I am sincere"
BPD,ff377o8,t3_eqrdtd,1579535334.0,"I think in a normal relationship over time men become complacent because they are content, woman become alarmed and reactive to this complacency because it diminishes attention. With borderlines this becomes greatly magnified because of their emotional issue associated with the condition. If they can condition themselves to stop sensing their partners too deeply for any signs of negative possibilities in their partners feelings they can probably survive the relationship and accept life with all its exciting but mostly dull moments."
BPD,ff35xjh,t3_er16ez,1579534455.0,"I understand you and the conflict within you. You cannot be with someone 100% and live inside yourself, for whatever the cause you are who you are. At the same time a normal side of you inherent to all humane beings (and don't let anyone tell you it's not) needs a companion and not just a friend, and somehow dedicate yourself through the ups and downs knowing that this is the companion who is actually special to you. Outside influences are too powerful for a borderline, need to follow your heart."
BPD,ff34oi0,t3_erdnyt,1579533594.0,"they do not have the ability to value someone outside themselves with a lifetime dedication, their is no nucleus or one person soulmate even if they temporarily imagine there is. They have no sense of family, and it is where society is swinging more so even for non BPD's but for them it is worse and now they feel more comfortable in it since it has become the fashion."
