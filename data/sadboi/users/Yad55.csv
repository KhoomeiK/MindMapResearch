SuicideWatch,fg82c1g,t3_exeljf,1580607648.0,"Hi, I’m turning 30 this year too and it’s hard to realise that this is it, there’s no big turnaround or grand scheme of things that will work out for me. If you asked me a couple of years ago, I would not be so down, I had a gf who I thought loved and cared about me, starting a bright career and planning for a future together. Now I’m alone and the profession I’m in has gone downhill and I will probably lose my job this year. The partner, who was my world, cheated and left me for someone with a lot more money and someone her family wanted her to be with. I can no longer get close or spend time with friends, I do not trust anyone anymore. The world is a cruel place and people are parasites. But I don’t let this change the way I am as a person, the only thing I have left is my integrity and self respect. 

I don’t know why I’m telling you this, maybe it’s because things change and you have to ride the highs and lows. Maybe it’s because people with anxiety and depression live in the past and see it with rose tinted glasses. 

I guess if things can change so much for the worse for me in a couple of years, maybe they can turn for the better for you?"

They weren’t the best but they tried their hardest. 20 is a bit young though, there’s still something’s that I can I say I somewhat enjoyed after turning 20, of course with those highs come some lows. But I’ll remember some of those moments and those people, even though they probably won’t.

Maybe try to stick around for that movie you want to watch or that game. Hope this reaches you in time."
SuicideWatch,f3vyjdm,t3_dig5go,1571187762.0,"Hey bud, sometimes you just have to remember the people you will leave behind and how it will effect them. My family is in a tough stop too and I wouldn’t want to make it worse by doing something stupid. Try doing something nice for someone, family members or friends, even strangers. Reach out to that person you have meaning to. See how you feel after that."
SuicideWatch,f3vslnr,t1_f3vfo9c,1571183794.0,"Just try doing one thing then another, see a the place you always wanted to go to. Do something nice for yourself/others. Sometimes you have to make things happen for yourself bud. What have you got the loose?"
TwoXChromosomes,f3t0x02,t3_di0uxd,1571114636.0,Good work! Now onto the future! You can be who you want and with who you want.
SuicideWatch,f3su5o9,t3_di1iey,1571109473.0,"Hey buddy, can’t imagine what your going through now. There’s nothing anyone can say or do to make you feel better. You just got to be the person your mum wanted you to be and make her proud. Share the love bud, love someone like you Mum loves you, unconditionally."
SuicideWatch,f3su09h,t3_dhzq77,1571109374.0,"Hey mate, maybe try to do some new things and try to have something on everyday. Never know who you might run into or just help you be better with yourself. Good luck bud!"
SuicideWatch,f3sttrz,t3_di1fyz,1571109247.0,"Buddy, she is probably just hurting. Hard to see a child like that I imagine. Not knowing your situation but maybe try doing something nice for her or someone and she how you feel after that?"
SuicideWatch,f3stkx5,t3_dhz2e7,1571109080.0,"Hey mate, I hope you you are all good still. Why don’t you trying doing something nice for someone and see how that goes. Know how your feeling and I hope you reconsider, maybe hold out till that movie you wanted to watch? Or that event? Just give it some time and see how you go, please?"
Anxiety,f2kb6qw,t3_ddn53x,1570283414.0,"Just be yourself dude, there’s a reason these guys are interested in giving you a job. Maybe practice with a friend or just call someone to make sure your comfortable. Good luck!"
Anxiety,f2jugvh,t1_f2jt659,1570277776.0,"What I mean is that, if you feel more anxious after doing something or seeing someone, try to avoid that for a bit. Maybe just stay in your comfort zone for a while and then when you feeling better, try those other things that will help in the long run."
Anxiety,f2jtjs4,t1_f2jnyo2,1570277540.0,"Mate trust me, you don’t want to be with someone who you are going to have to ‘act’ a certain way. Just be yourself and you will find someone you likes you the way you are. 

Eventually the person you are dating will see the real you, why not just be like that from the start? And if someone doesn’t like you for you acting like yourself, they are doing you are a favour. Stops you and them from wasting your time."
Anxiety,f2jrk8v,t1_f2jn3yj,1570276670.0,"Glad your parents are supportive and looking out for you. I’m going through something similar now. Thought I was better now back in the same place, but the thing is that you did it before you just have to do it again. Use all the experience of the past and learn from some of the things you did wrong. 

Sometimes when it’s pretty bad, you just have to be careful and avoid things that will trigger you and minimise feeling like this. Also just accepting that some days are gonna be shit can help."
Anxiety,f2jn7w9,t1_f2jm2fv,1570274947.0,"It’s not really bad though, who judges what is it good to be like? Everyone is different. You will have people who go on about stuff and some who like to listen. Just be yourself, if you constantly questioning what you are saying or not saying, maybe the current crowd you are in isn’t for you."
Anxiety,f2jm364,t3_ddlp2b,1570274487.0,"Hey, besides going to a professional and talking about this, what have you tired to change your situation or your feelings? I struggle with the same feelings that you have but I try to do something once a day to improve at something. Like a skill or a sport or something to just keep me active. I find that when I’m either playing a sport or exercising I’m just concentrating on that in the moment and it’s a relief. 

This temporarily and sometimes you are gonna feel shit but as you build on something it will lead to other things. Doesn’t have to be something physical to begin with, if your not inclined. Can be a video game or something work/study related."
Anxiety,f2jjent,t3_ddlia0,1570273395.0,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, none of the people are thinking about this or the conversation you had. Like I said to my friend who gets a bit shy at the gym, everyone is too focused on themselves and their lives to be worrying or caring about yours. If people do have a negative opinion of you, you don’t really want to care about what those people think anyways."
Anxiety,f2jiu7i,t3_ddiny6,1570273165.0,"As someone with anxiety I too come up with a thousand things that could be going on or the worst possible outcomes. I struggle with this too but the best thing I find is to plan things for yourself and not invest all your time staring at your phone waiting for a reply or a text. 

Maybe use the time to plan out something nice for when you guys are together or just work on yourself. As people with anxiety it is very easy to start questioning everything and confront the person and that will be the wrong move. Just bring it up next time gradually in conversation and explain why it’s important to you to receive messages and of course how much communication is important in a relationship. 

As it sounds like your partner isn’t big on phones and communication, I would bring this up but not think too much into it. In my opinion it’s all about the persons actions and not what they say or do. I would rather be with someone who is there when you need it, rather than just all words and lovey dicey messages."
