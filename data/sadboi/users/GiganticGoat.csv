I hope this picture doesn't incriminate the guy in the mask. You know what these communists are like. They'll know within the day who the little kid is and within the week they'll have rounded up every male between the ages of 18-30 she knows and tortured them in a work camp somewhere."

Posting ""Fuck the Chinese Government"" on Reddit does nothing.

EDIT: I know that it raises awareness. I guess the point I was making (or trying to make) was that awareness is useless without action. Posting ""Fuck the Chinese Government"" on reddit is preaching to the choir, or yelling in your echo chamber. We need to take tangible steps to support the cause now. As mentioned in the original comment, I didn't know how to. I've seen and heard so much about the situation in Hong Kong but felt completely powerless in how to help."

I get moments where I think that people are controlling things to wind me up for their own amusement. For example, I had a BPD rage-fit because I couldn't get the internet to work at home.
