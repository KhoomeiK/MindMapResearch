malaysia,f0n5gk6,t1_f0m48lt,1568761038.0,"Please take care, my friend had something like this happen about a week ago but no had came to help her. This happened at USJ7 and it was a grown man in his 30s or 40s asking a college student for her number continuously. He said “I know if it’s fake, I will miss call u until it’s your number or until you pick up.” My friend was scared but she just blocked his number otw home."

If it was in my case and she/he steps and leaves to another coach and you saw it. Just tell her/him “I saw what happened, are you okay?”. That’s all if they don’t want to answer just move on. If she is startled, and she doesn’t leave please step in and just be loud as possible (basically just scold la). He/She will be grateful. The harasser will be embarrassed.

If it was following and you know a person was following this lone girl/guy, act as their boyfriend/friend. 

“Eh babe/man, *glance to the harasser* where you park the car?”

They will leave.


Moving on if you still think this is all over-stepping, take a picture of the harasser show it to the authorities. Or post it. Just let it get out along with what happened."
Anxiety,f0m1li7,t3_d56opw,1568734655.0,"I use to get really anxious on coffee to the point it would trigger several panic attacks but I NEEDED it to study cause I had a big test. My anxiety and depression did get better after therapy but I still heavily relied on coffee. If I went two days without it, I’d be in cold sweats and vomitting, even nausea. I became depressed again, didn’t get out of bed and rather I did worst things than coffee itself like taking sleeping pills and alcohol just so time would pass by faster. Then I got back on coffee, feeling guilty that I relied on it. Though these past few months, I drink coffee everyday except one day a week. I took then in moderation, 1 cup a day on the regular. Tired days would be 2 cups and a cup would be around 240 mL. When I took it in moderation and my body got use to it, the effects weren’t as bad. I can’t deny when I take too much I can’t sleep at night and get jittery and lose control, though I just try to calm myself with chamomile tea at the end of the day. If that doesn’t work I try deep breathing. 

I started to feel not guilty for relying on coffee, it wasn’t as though it was killing me because I took it in moderation. It’s a unhealthy habit but also healthier than going back to old ways. 

Just take it slow, everything will sort itself out and if ever need someone. Just pm me"
