Motocross,fqzg8d0,t1_fqycdbx,1589766715.0,"Np. 

I can’t speak for road bikes as I don’t have 20 years of experience there but for dirt bikes yes the hydraulic clutches are generally a much easier pull. 

You can get aftermarket hydraulic adapters for cable bikes like your kdx as well and those help. I feel like I came off too much like “this is why KTMs are better” when really what I meant was “Honda has put in minimal effort on their enduro bikes - which still produces a good bike because it’s Honda but not quite on par with KTM”

Like if Honda cared to put in the R&D they could take over KTMs entire market."

Motocross,fqwwwtb,t1_fqvq5rt,1589720067.0,"FYI when I say KTM I mean to include the husabergs/gas gas/etc but I'll just say KTM for simplicity. 

This would be awesome and it would possibly get me back on a japanese machine. The problem is that Honda and the Japanese manufacturers do not care about the enduro / offroad market. Even the RX / FX series of fourstrokes really don't compete with offerings KTM and its variants just based off the fact that the KTM bikes are literally 20 pounds lighter. That alone is a deciding factor for many considering the importance of weight in hard enduro. Add to that the lack of hydraulic clutches (another thing that's more important in tough offroad) and even the lack of e start on the 250x it's clear that they just don't really care to match KTM shot for shot. They seem to have put their offerings on the table, and like everything the Japanese bike manufacturers make the offerings are good. But the KTMs are just better in several ways. If you've ridden an RX for example you know that it just feels like what it is: a MX bike modified to be ridden offroad. That definitely works. I've built a 450R for offroad before and it was decent. But the KTMs feel built from the start as an offroad bike. It's not like Honda and the others don't know this. It's just not a big enough market for them to care yet I guess."

This ban effectively changes nothing in terms of how capable any given Canadian is of taking another persons life with a firearm. There’s no change. So it isn’t disarming the law abiding citizens. 

The only thing this law does is make people who know nothing about guns happy, make people who like guns more prone to vote conservative, and make anyone who knows about guns realize that Trudeau/the liberals is virtue signalling again and has no fucking clue what he’s doing. In my case that makes me less likely to vote for them again. Especially when combined with the broken promise on electoral reform. 

To not be “that guy” look for parsimonious answers. Politicians generally only care about how things look or sound on the surface. This is somewhat well know. Trudeau in particular loves to virtue signal. Even to the point that he would interrupt a woman while she’s speaking to correct her saying “man kind” to “people
kind”.

enduro,fo7k20n,t1_fo7hkus,1587579664.0,"For sure... to really ride a slow wheelie you need to be comfortable getting the front tire way up there and eventually letting the weight come back and holding it up with rear brake instead of throttle. There is just no way to do this without going over many times. I tell people to keep their feet on the pegs until they feel the grass on their back. You have to kill that habit of taking feet off the foot pegs. Not only is it really a dangerous habit to have when doing fast wheelies, but it takes your foot off the rear brake which is half the control of the wheelie and the one your really need to be using when that instinct to get off the bike kicks in. 

To ride a good wheelie is to ridge the knifes edge of flipping over backwards. And Hunter Thompson said it best: The edge, there’s no real way to explain it because the only ones who know where it is are the ones who have gone over."

The cost is much lower not only to purchase but to maintain. You could buy this bike and ride it for 40 years with oil changes and basic maintenance. It does not need engine and suspension rebuilds like the race bikes do. It doesn’t flame out either. 

There are even some vet racers I know who race the 230 with a set of R or X forks on it. The mild power delivery is much less tiring to ride and this makes a difference for these guys. Is a race bike more competitive? Of course. But these guys, along with 99.9% of riders are riding for leisure not a paycheck. So finishing the race and being more comfortable doing it is their priority. 

Another thing is that these bikes have had electric start for many years which was a selling point for many. 

It’s a very weird culture on Reddit and the forums where everyone seems to think the only bikes to have are race bikes and that everyone should learn to ride on a 125 or 250 mxer. 

Compare this to the road. Many people just want a comfortable car to do road trips in. Not everyone wants a Lamborghini. For some they can get just as much enjoyment for much less cost out of a civic. 

Same thing occurs in the motorcycle forums. Everyone talks big about 600 super sports. If you ever owned one you’d know the least comfortable bikes and you can have 9/10th of the power for half the insurance costs on a sport tourer that will be more comfortable for every day riding as well. 

It’s just a stupid mentality where people think they need a race bike and it’s all ego. Riding is 80-90% the rider and the rest the bike.
