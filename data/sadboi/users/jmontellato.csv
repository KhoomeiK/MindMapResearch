writing,fpio2dq,t3_gdlnc9,1588644961.0,"'Seth stares at the ground, admitting defeat. Erica can't stand being in the same room as him, overwhelmed and needing to breathe, she dashes down the stairwell toward the shared garden to get some fresh air. Upon arrival, she leans against the wall, sliding down into a little ball, tightly clutching her knees. Erica's world was caving in, falling apart before her very eyes, the painful realization ""everything she's ever known has been a lie"" echoing within her mind; Wrought with anguish, she can physically feel her aching heart. It feels like she's dying as she begins to sob uncontrollably. The irony of it all was that the one person she wanted to comfort her, was the one who caused the agony. ""How could he do this to her?"" she asked herself.  She loved him so much, he said he loved her back but he clearly didn't love her at all. *""I'm such an idiot, how could I have believed that anyone would love me.""* '

I took the liberty to make some minor edits.  Hope that's ok, you can use it if you like them.  I'd be very careful about switching between past/present tenses and maybe do some research into when it is and isn't ok to do so (I'm not sure).  Hope I could help"

depression,fnc5p01,t3_g0qyn8,1586829167.0,"“There is one field of feeling, however, in which either I am different from most people or they do not dare tell the truth–perhaps not knowing it or not daring to face it or perhaps feeling that it is a monstrous thing which should not be brought into the light.  I don’t know that this is so, I simply offer these as reasons why people do not feel as I do.  I refer to the will to live.  I have very little of it.  This must not be confused with a death wish.  I have no will to die but I can remember no time from earliest childhood until this morning when I would not have preferred never to have existed. No moment of joy or excitement or sharp experience of pain or sorrow has even made me want to be alive if the opposite were possible. You see it is not a longing for death but a kind of hunger never to have lived. The few times I have stated this I have been attacked with everything from straight disbelief to a kind of hatred as though I were a traitor to life.  And perhaps I am.  But my feeling is not based on any thought whatever.  It lies far below the lighted levels of thought, somewhere in the blackness from which impulses arise.”

I had the pleasure of seeing it (on a whim) in theaters and I seriously cannot heap enough praise on the film. It is such a beautiful work of art, the understatedly tender performances by the actresses, absolutely gorgeous cinematography, minimalistic, yet emotively effective script, the exceptional use of silence(!), suffice it to say Portrait of Lady on Fire is a stunningly exquisite film, and I’d go so far as to call it a masterpiece. I was so disappointed and dumbfounded upon seeing it wasn’t chosen (by France) to be sent to the Academy Awards, c’est la vie. It was recently put on Hulu, unfortunately, that’s the only place it’s (legally) streamable as far as I know."

As far as the urges go, you could try reminding yourself why you stopped in the first place. It actually sounds like your coming at it from a pretty rational perspective, in that you’re aware it won’t provide you with the relief your seeking. 
You could also try to separating yourself from the thought/urge, observing it from a state of gentle curiosity rather than being identified/fused with the thought. I personally haven’t been able achieve this really, however, I have heard/seen several things where this is described as being beneficial (Eckhart Tolle, Russell Brand, Buddhist ideology, meditation techniques etc.)
I hope some of this helps and that my advice doesn’t come off as trite; I know fighting urges is incredibly difficult, I can definitely sympathize. If you do/did smoke try not to beat yourself up. Do you have any MA meetings in your state? If not, they do have online meetings you could check out, and if you’d like to talk someone you can always PM me and I’ll try to reach out as soon as possible. 

All the best,

I did guided meditation (Headspace) every day for about 120 days, didn’t notice a huge difference to be honest, though I have heard of all the scientific benefits. Regardless, it is something I’d like to get back into. Constructing a daily exercise regimen is something I also need to get on. I get decent exercise with my current job but it’s not really enough.

I hear you with the self medicating and I’m sorry you’re struggling with mental illness as well, in my experience weed hasn’t “cure” anything, it only masks it. But boy did I use that mask as much as I could; I was the same way in that I felt content when I was high, it got to the point (several times) where I literally was high all the time. Now that I’m not I feel like I don’t really know how to function anymore. I can relate to missing it too, I miss the person I was smoking weed. What tools have been the most helpful for you?"
