bipolar2,fq6vwmp,t1_fq6a1dt,1589138523.0,"I used to take Xanax xr all the time and it helped a lot, but they don't give that stuff out lightly. Ativan works in the moment I'm having a panic attack, which is rare, but my biggest issue now is recognizing that a panic attack is coming because it's not a tsunami anymore, it's more of a slow rising tide. The latuda really worked wonders for me. It took all of the anxiety, frustration, irritation, and feeling like I'm trapped and washed it all away. I also have seasonal affective disorder, so my meds cycle throughout the year to a higher doses in the winter and lower the rest of the year.

Ssri's alone and unopposed by antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are a scary thing. Any ssri, not just Zoloft. When I was a teenager, they gave me ssri's for hair pulling and drove me straight into mania, but unfortunately no one recognized that I was already bipolar back then. They just thought I was a moody teenager. So I struggled through college and grad school and eventually during my first job someone figured it out, but not before my mood swings got me fired. So it took years and years of me trying meds to find one that worked. But you also have to remember I was searching for something that would make me stop pulling my hair too, not just take the edge off of being me. Some meds were ok, but they did nothing for the hair pulling. Only latuda worked for that.

Long story short, never ever take antidepressants unopposed. You will make yourself manic. If you take them alongside an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer you'll have an entirely different experience, so don't let one bad experience turn you off to treatment in general. Also there is no one cocktail that works for everyone, I'm proof of that. It might take time and lots of med failures. These are not personal failures so don't get discouraged. You just have to find the right key for your brain's lock, and it takes time and effort."

Of course it took higher doses (100 mg) to treat me completely (I'm also a compulsive hair puller and at the time I was totally bald from pulling, hello anxiety.) I've been on celexa with it too, but it wasn't really helping, so I've switched to cymbalta (60 mg) and I'm doing a lot better. I have energy again and a drive to exist in the universe. I've stopped pulling all my hair except my eyebrows, so I think that's pretty good.
I've been able to hold down jobs and I'm currently in my dream job as a catalyst chemist/engineer. I have the occasional off day but it's nothing I can't handle and if I need a personal day, my manager is understanding. I have a good friend who helps keep me in the world by force too, making me have dinner, go for walks, hang out, etc. 

The only downside is that the latuda gives me wicked migraines so I have to take topamax too, 100 mg, to mostly kill the headaches. I tried taking 200 but it turned me into the court jester and I was dumber than a box of rocks. So I stick with 100 and deal with minor headaches. 

My insurance pays for the latuda, my copay is $25 a month so I lucked out there. I hope you find good treatment, it really is an amazing feeling when your meds work and you finally find peace."

And she crawled under the sink, I explained what to do, her A cups didn't hit the drain pipes, and in 20 minutes I had a new faucet.

It's just not fair sometimes. It's bad enough that men feel they need to rescue women but I actually need my flatter chested friends to save my ass.

The struggle is indeed real."

BipolarReddit,fep6pxs,t3_epucjb,1579313372.0,"I haven't had a period in about 12 years. I use depo Provera, which for 12 years isn't super healthy because of the possibility of bone density loss, but they keep an eye on it and my bones are just fine. I tried an implant but that made my boobs grow 3 cup sizes in 3 months, and when you're already a G, that's just not going to work in the long term. 

You can skip periods with the right pills, you basically just don't have a placebo week, you just keep going from pack to pack. Not all birth controls are designed to do this, so talk to your doctor about it.

There's no danger to skipping a period. It's literally just your uterine lining building up over the month then sloughing off in a bloody, miserable mess. Fuck that noise. If you don't want a period, you don't have to have one. You get to decide.

My irritability and monthly cycle sanity improved immensely once I no longer had a period, I can't recommend it enough. It helps with my migraines too. Before, I was getting 3-4 a week, now I get 1-2  a week and they're less severe. 

Plus why waste time, pain, and money on periods?"

I have a good paying job that I love and my life is pretty good. I still face issues like any normal human, but the latuda made it possible to actually have a life. 

It was super expensive for a long time ($3600/month at my dosage before insurance, 100 after), but there's a generic coming on the market now, so that will help with accessibility.

I should also mention that if I take it in the daytime, it gives me an overwhelming feeling of dread and panic. Solution : take it at night and no problems whatsoever."
bipolar,febvcaq,t3_eoa26j,1578963097.0,"I had problems keeping a job until I found ones that I actually had a passion for and had managers and coworkers that were friendly and supportive and actually wanted me to succeed. I had an awesome job 4 years ago that lasted 2 years, then I was laid off. Bounced between jobs that I hated for another year and a half and I found a job that I love a year ago and I've already been promoted and given more responsibilities.

I think the biggest thing was finding a job that I actually cared about. I'm a research chemist and I was trying to take quality control jobs just to have a job and they were all terrible because I just don't function and think like a qc person, I'm a researcher at heart. I need a job where I give a shit and people give a shit about me. I don't do office drama either so I'm glad there isn't that kind of vibe at my current job. 

If you don't have the education to get the job you're passionate about, there's always the possibility of going back to school. If you have had enough of education, then you might think about talking to a career counselor to figure out what your passions are and how to find a job that will suit them.

I'm not sure how helpful my perspective is, but I really hope you find a job you love!"

I feel your pain, the road markings are awful up here.

Edit... Florida has raised reflectors, so you can feel them even if you can't see them, hence the plow comment. I just assumed the glass beads that make the paint reflective would be worn off by the plows too. Lessons were learned, mistakes were made."

depression,fdin437,t3_elhhgz,1578446606.0,"For me, it's that when I'm in a group of people, it makes me feel lonely versus in my own company I don't notice the loneliness. I think it's because I want something from the people - I want them to understand me, I want them to ask me how I'm doing and not in that passing way, but in a meaningful way. I want them to fathom that a bipolar person exists in their midst and not just judge me as crazy.

That's asking a lot of people whom I don't tell what's really going on with me, whom I give my brave face to every day. They don't know that I struggle, so they won't know what to say to me. And that's the difference between real friends and acquaintances. Not everyone will be your friend, but you'll have lots of acquaintances. It's not that they're bad, uncaring people, they're just not your people.

We know our people when we meet them. At least I do. There's a needle in the haystack that I find every 5 years or so whom I trust and think will get me from the start.

You just have to make your expectations more reasonable. There's socializing and there's spending time with friends. There's a distinct difference."

bipolar2,fdckcuj,t1_fdcjby7,1578277055.0,"Well, it's supposedly weight neutral, but because I take a bunch of other medications for other conditions that also cause weight gain, I can't really say that one med or the other causes it. I'm the wrong person to ask that. 

But many people get nauseated taking it so if you do, ask your Dr for Zofran,especially if you find that it works for you. Word of warning though, Zofran makes you constipated so take stool softeners daily. Latuda  can also cause tremors/jerky muscles and panic attacks. It's not super common, but just be prepared. The tremors can be treated, but tell your dr if they're happening. Panic attacks usually happen if you take it too early, I just take mine at bedtime so I sleep through them. 

It's also incredibly important to take it with 350 calories. I take mine right before bed with a big glass of chocolate milk. You need that many calories to properly absorb the medication. Do not eat grapefruit either, it can cause overdose.

I'm not trying to scare you off of taking it, just giving you an honest rundown."
