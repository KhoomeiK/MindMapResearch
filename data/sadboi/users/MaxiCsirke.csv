1) The EU 41/42s fit my 260mm feet just perfectly. Really, it's mind blowing how comfortable they are.

2) Switching from the FRs to the Aeons, even thou I love my FR Skates, was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Skating aggressive is in my opinion so much better. I just can't get over how stable I am in those. The only downsides are the obvious ones: The 60mm wheels are definitely slower than the 80 or 110 ones and it's much easier to get one of your wheels stuck in cracks.

Overall, I'm really sad to say this, but I think I'll never switch back to my FRs if I don't have to. The Aeons are just that good. You definitely won't regret buying these skates. Hope I could help!"
