You’ll need:
-1 can of chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and mashed (I used a food processor but fork mashing works)

-vegan mayo (I used Hellman’s veganaise)

-fresh lemon juice to taste 

-celery, chopped very fine (as much as you want, depending on how crunchy you like it)

- red onion, chopped fine (optional, I used like a tablespoon and a smidge because I wanted that flavor)

-nori (I used 3 sheets of Annie Chun’s seaweed snacks in sea salt flavor), chopped up fine

-celery seed

-garlic powder

-salt

-pepper


Putting it together:
1. Take your mashed chick peas and mix some vegan mayo into it until you achieve your desired texture. I like juuuuust enough mayo to make it not dry. Two spoonfuls with a smallish serving spoon was enough for me. Best bet is to add a bit of mayo, mix with a fork, and repeat until satisfied.
2. Throw in your nori, celery, and red onion
3. Squeeze in some fresh lemon juice
4. Add the celery seed, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste.
5. Mix it all up with a fork and make a sandwich! I put it on pita with some cucumber slices."

iamverysmart,fk4lcs0,t1_fk4hyfc,1583862719.0,I'm 24 and I'm just now starting to realize I might have it now that I'm married to someone with diagnosed ADD. I'm going to see about getting help for it soon.
iamverysmart,fk4l79r,t3_fgenls,1583862634.0,This is a valid problem though. I have a hard time focusing on learning things when they're required but will spend hours upon hours researching something that actually interests me. I was a walking encyclopedia of the  battle of Gettysburg and the civil war in general in the 5th and 6th grades but I couldn't tell you shit about what we were actually doing in class.

insanepeoplefacebook,fjobha0,t1_fjmzm2v,1583524421.0,Dude I make 18.85/hr and I can't afford half the shit the median wage worker has here. Idk if the person who made this infographic knows how much things cost.
misophonia,fjo8rgt,t3_fedryk,1583522845.0,"My husband does not have misophonia, but I do. For his part, he tries to eat kinda far away from me, unless it's a family meal. If he's snacking and I'm not eating he'll do it in a different room. 

For my part, the only thing I can do is regulate my breathing and focus on something else. I've actually gotten to the point where most of his noises don't bother me as much. Like a mild twinge. I still can't handle the chewing, but like I said, he tries to put distance between us. In restaurants and stuff the background noise drowns it out enough for me. And if we're eating at the same table we'll talk or have the TV on or something to give me something else to tune into."
