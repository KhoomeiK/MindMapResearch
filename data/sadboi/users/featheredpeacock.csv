fuckeatingdisorders,f6gjhpe,t3_dr4ui2,1572826754.0,"Nothing is not the answer. The chemicals in your brain adjust to this new way of life, similar to how your metabolism lowers because of the decreased intake of nutrients or the starvation switch has been flicked on and you are simply existing.  No matter how little you consume, your body will adjust accordingly, as will your brain. I like to think it is similar to the lobster phenomenon; when a lobster loses a battle with another lobster, it will shrink away in fear, is more likely to lose to other lobsters, and can sometimes become so defeated its brain will literally dissolve and rebuild itself due to the lobsters' new lowly status. You have been defeated by this ED so many times that the chemicals in your brain respond differently, you have forced a restart, and now your brain is responding in a way it thinks it is meant to. 

Our bodies are amazing in a way that it will change to suit the environment, no matter what we throw at it. However, as with everything, there is always a tipping point. Please don't let yourself hit that point. I care what happens to you."
