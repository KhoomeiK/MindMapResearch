My story is much similar. Told one roommate to read a headline or stay the fuck away from me.

surfing,fihfofw,t3_f7n4ur,1582409778.0,"1. Are you nose diving or not catching the wave at all? Other? What type of break is it? 

2. Try and get footage of yourself paddling into a few. Highlight what worked or what didnt. Get a more experienced friend to look at the footage with you. Or consider investing in a private lesson or two with a certified instructor/coach. One on one real time corrections and or video analysis are the best. Or just cue up endless summer 

Yew!


Lastly - a good cue for when to pop up is feeling the tail of your board lift. Get famaliar with that feeling like its your job. White water, green wave - both give that tail lift sensation when its go time to pop up. Im with homeboy above too - weight distribution with throw way too many wrenches in the wheels here."
