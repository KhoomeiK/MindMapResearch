One of the cool things about any job offer-based PNP is that if your PGWP is close to running out (or if you don’t have a work permit, like if you’re applying under [OINP Employer Job Offer: Foreign Worker Stream](https://www.ontario.ca/page/oinp-employer-job-offer-foreign-worker-stream)), you can get a closed **LMIA-exempt** work permit using what’s called the **T14** LMIA exemption."

I'd recommend reading the post above. Second, some things I don't mention in the post are:

* **Explore PNPs** more -- *they are often easier* than qualifying federally (under FSW) but they take longer to process. Do a lot of research, into each province many PNP pathways.
* Try to get a job offer from a designated employer under [**AIP**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration-pilot.html) or [**RNIP**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot.html).

PNPs, AIP, RNIP all lead to permanent residence.

Regarding FSW (Federal Skilled Worker): the easiest way to qualify is to get a Master's degree.

You seem to already have 3 years of skilled (*defined as Type 0/A/B*) work experience. Your 4 years of paralegal seems to fall under [NOC 4211](https://immilist.com/documentation/noc-4211-paralegal-and-related-occupations/), which is NOC Type B, **which is considered skilled**.

So the next step for you, if you want to apply under FSW, is to get a Master's degree. Grad schools in the US **can be affordable** if you go to in-state schools. For example, in New York, the CUNY and SUNY schools are fairly affordable for residents of New York.

You could also do a remote Master's. The important thing here is to make sure that the educational institution issuing the Master's is legitimate, and that your degree would be recognized as a Master's when you do your ECA (Educational Credential Assessment).

*Note*: You won't be able to enter Canada on a student visa or any other temporary visa because of your status in the US. All temporary visas (TRVs) require showing that you will return home at the end of your stay in Canada, and that will be difficult in your case."

Step 1 would be to get a copy of the denial letter from your previous employer. Try to compel them to give it you somehow.

OPT is actually not mentioned anywhere or as a part of the immigration laws (ie. statutory laws) written by Congress. OPT was entirely created by the Executive Branch.

A 17-month STEM extension was added by the Bush administration in the mid-2000s, and it was increased by a modest 7 months to 24 months by Obama.

Statutory law (the Immigration and Nationality Act and other immigration laws, codified in Title 8 of the U.S.C.) actually does not mention OPT anywhere. It considers the F-1 visa and status as simply a student visa. OPT falls entirely under the realm of regulatory law.

ProgrammingLanguages,fp15zlf,t3_gaixzh,1588225358.0,"My hope is that someday **V8 is modified** to accept an IR that Python and Ruby could target.

V8 is basically the fastest runtime for a dynamically-typed language. The other options *don’t even come close*.

We could, perhaps, ask the folks building V8 (Google et al?) to have V8 take an IR. I’m not familiar with the internals of V8, and maybe it already has an IR, and  we’d just need to expose it. But it’s possible (I’m guessing again) that V8 does very few passes on the JS, to get things to run as fast as possible.

Languages like Python and Ruby could easily be translated to JS. A stop-gap measure could be a Python/Ruby-to-JS compiler. But our long-term goal is to link to a language-agnostic “libv8” (or something) and have Python/Ruby/etc to run as fast as JS today does.

The incredibly challenging problem that V8 sort of “solves” is making a weakly-and-dynamically-typed language ***run fast***.

Making dynamically typed language run fast is definitely an incredibly hard problem. Python and Ruby(MRI) have historically been known for being 10x to 40x slower that C (or probably most languages that target LLVM). The fact that the wizards over at Google and other companies were able to get JS to run with a mere 3x to 5x perf penalty is an achievement. We gotta try to get all dynamically-typed languages to benefit from this huge/amazing achievement."

   * For example, if you buy from Amazon, you will be charged **both** the shipping cost **and** VAT upfront.

   * But some retailers will only ask you to pay the shipping cost upfront. In these cases cases the shipping carrier will collect the VAT from you at the time of delivery. The VAT would be calculated on the basis of the value of the goods.

It's incredibly cruel/inhumane to throw out a family **after 15 years**. The mom would have a difficult time finding jobs due to being undocumented, but it shouldn't be impossible. The family has contributed to the country for 15 years and the guy who had the H-1 probably had an approved PERM + I-140, so it's pretty cruel and unfair to expect them to leave. The low EB cap along with EB country caps are to blame for that family not being PRs already.

If she is the mother of a U.S.C., she can get PR after the kid turns 21 years old, as the normal bar to AOS doesn't apply: [https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-8](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-8) Alternatively, if the blue party wins, she might be able to get legal status sooner. (She and her kids should probably also get involved politically involved, and fight / volunteer / advocate for the blue party.)

h1b,fopzeqr,t3_g8wdg9,1587977396.0,"Can the business be moved out of Bangalore, or is it physically tied to Bangalore/India?

If you can move it out of India, there are a lot of countries that will give you a visa, especially if your  business has that much revenue.

If you prefer western counties, someone had made a list of various European startup/entrepreneur visas—I’ll share it if I can find it. Canada also has several business/entrepreneur permanent residency pathways (a federal one as well several at the provincial levels - see PNPs).

If you want to be close to India, and live in a rich first-world country that’s full of Indian people, there’s the UAE. It’s a zero income tax country, where the cost of living can *be very low* if you want it to be (e.g. live in Sharjah and commute to Dubai). Around 40% of the long-term residents of the UAE are Indian; and it’s over 50% if you consider all of South Asia. Most of the Indians are from South India, particularly Kerala. The UAE’s zero income tax and low COL would let you save a lot. There are some restrictions around company ownership, and so you’d have to set up your company in a free zone. You can simply open a branch there as well. Note that India’s tax laws waive all taxes on you, if you are a NRI (“non-resident Indian”) — which I think is defined as someone who spends 180 (or was it 240?) days outside India."

Can a different employer than the original PERM and I-140 petitioner ask for the 1-year extension?

Also, how would a different employer keep you in the country while they do the PERM + I-140 all over again from scratch? Does a new pending PERM make you eligible for an extension?

Lastly, would the final date on the extension be 1 year plus the date that your PD became current? If you had remaining time on the 6 year limit, I assume they’d pick the later of either date?"
h1b,fonyf9j,t1_fomwvup,1587928933.0,"That is a very good article.

I was told by a lawyer a while ago that while a switch a B-2 would likely be fine, that if a new employer files an I-129 petition *to switch back from B-2 to H-1B*, then you could be accused (by USCIS) of misrepresentation of intent when the COS to B-2 was requested. Such an accusation results in a lifetime ban.

The same lawyer also said if the I-539 states that you intend to use the B-2 to looks for a new employer (and eventually switch back to the H-1B), then USCIS would just deny the I-529 for lack of non-immigrant intent. If you concealed that fact, they might approved the B-2, but in the future, accuse you of misrepresentation, and ban you for life.

Apparently, the only practical solution (according to this lawyer was): leave the country after you find a job, have the employer file the I-129 with consular processing, and then return to the country with that new I-129 (plus get a new H-1B visa stamp, if necessary).

Of course, due to COVID-19, getting a new visa stamp route is impossible for most individuals (unless they work in healthcare). Even people with visas valid for a long time,  are in danger of not being let back into the country, due to whatever new anti-immigrant executive order is being cooked up by those in power."
h1b,fonwxcu,t1_fomw2ye,1587928087.0,"Question from before: was this a lottery petition?

Were you able to get a copy of the denial letter from your employer?

Timing is critical hear. The denial letter typically says ""it is final"" after 30 days, so you need to hire a lawyer, and appeal (filing form I-290B), or sue ASAP. If the previous employer is not cooperating, then *appealing (form I-290B)* is not be as viable, but suing is definitely something you need to do.

You might have standing to sue, because an approval of this petition would give the right to be ""cap-exempt"" for 6 years, which is a huuuuuge deal. Besides, the loss of this job and the associated loss of income, imminent loss of legal status in the US, are all severe damages you will / are suffering, due to this unfair denial.

You should ask the new employer if they can pay for a lawyer. The lawyer would sue *on your behalf*, since you have more standing to sue, than the new employer."
