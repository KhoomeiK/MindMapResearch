Well, it’s not nice, but it’s just comforting knowing I’m not going insane.

Yeah, I understand fully. Every day I wish something absolutely horrible and life changing would happen to me. Just something absolutely terrible, that would hurt me now and for a long time. Then I’d finally have something valid to point to and say “this is why I’m not feeling well”. Because currently I have such a good life I hate it."

Normally, she’s pretty independent and easy to get along with. Though the trauma really takes ahold of her. It’s only been described once before in the story, her experiencing a flashback. It was a flashback worse than usual, and it happened in front of a crowd of people. She had trouble suppressing it, being in front of a crowd, so she quickly fled the scene. It’s a very touchy subject for her, especially since she’s young (Early teens-the abuse occurred around ages 6-9). After that scene she didn’t show up to school the next day, and for the remains of the week it was hard for her to act normally. I wouldn’t say she handles it well, but she’s also seeing a therapist at the same time so I’m wondering if that would affect how she would talk about it.

(Also, mind if I ask the name of the book? It sounds like a good read)"
mentalhealth,flcibou,t3_fo093a,1585031974.0,"It is never time for something like this. As someone who’s struggled with suicidal thoughts, I can STILL assure you it will be okay. I understand that everyone seems to say that, but it is true. Whether you’re 27 struggling, or 86 struggling, everything will turn out okay. There are too many amazing things you’ll miss. And despite how much you think no one will miss you- someone will. Everything I know about you is from this singular post, but I can say with confidence I’ll miss you. You’ve done too much good for the world, even if you don’t think so. Just the tiny gestures, like pointing someone in the right direction or telling them you like their shirt make someone’s day. If you’re not there to do it who will? Probably not a lot of people.

Feel free to talk to me if you’re not feeling well. But most importantly if you’re having suicidal thoughts, CALL THE SUICIDE HOTLINE! I know you see it everywhere, but that hotline is is posted for a reason. There are professionals on the other side of that line waiting to help you. Please understand that if you make the decision to end it here, you’ll miss too much of the world, and the world will miss too much of you.

If it’s of any comfort, I have done extensive research on the topic and have many connections with mental health professionals and people who struggle with PTSD, who have given me tips along the way. I just thought I could use the help of other writers for this particular scene, but I do apologize if it comes off as it not being my place."
writing,flch5tg,t1_flcgynj,1585030692.0,"How so? I’ve already got an idea how she’ll talk about it, but I like to double check with other writers and get their input. As well as make sure I’m being respectful while writing her. Something I’m missing?"
suggestmeabook,fl3opgh,t3_flvftp,1584793265.0,"1. The Thickety (any book in the series)
2. Red, White, & Royal Blue 

Yeah, those are my two genres."
suggestmeabook,fjv7ft2,t3_fexvpc,1583623874.0,"Sounds like you could use a book that’ll get you wanting to read it all the time.
I recommend the Thickety. I would always say “this is the last chapter tonight.” And then proceed to read 3 more. The Thickety series is amazing.

If you’re into romance, Red,White,and Royal Blue is amazing. I didn’t want it to end.

Lily and Dunkin is another great one. I read 100 pages every day, it was addicting. Keep in mind RW&RB and Lily & Dunkin are both LGBTQ books, so if you’re not into that I don’t recommend it. The Thickety is for everyone though ;)"
suggestmeabook,fioutwm,t3_f8spcz,1582591503.0,"Red, White, And Royal blue is beautifully written and modern. You don’t want to put it down. Ive never been obsessed with a book so much before, definitely a must read. I would read it at night and be so excited for the next day, where I could read it again."
suggestmeabook,fhob6l5,t3_f40mxy,1581748300.0,"May I recommend the Thickety? I only put it here because it’s such an unpopular series I can’t see many people picking it up, much less recommending it on Reddit. It is so good, by far my favorite book series. You have to look it up."

The first son and the prince of England fall in love with eachother, and have to face the hardships of forbidden love. Sounds cliche, but it’s beautifully written and modern. I’m in love with this book, I’ve never been obsessed with one this much before."
Advice,f9ip4bj,t3_e59ubz,1575342577.0,"I think it depends. Are you guys already good friends? Or have you just met her? If you’ve just met her, then get to know her just a bit more before you make any moves. If you’ve known her for a while though, ask her! Or confess to her that you like her (if you do). Be careful, there’s always a chance shes just a good friend."
