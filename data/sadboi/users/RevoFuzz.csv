arenaofvalor,fqwofyg,t3_gkr06w,1589712006.0,"First I would remove the entire enchantment system because it makes balance the game difficult. Sure many heroes would be nerfed significantly without it like Peura, Monkey king, Airi etc... But then balancing heroes it self would be easier from here on out because they don’t have dumb power boost because of enchantment anymore.

I would then nerf Dirak and Raz into oblivion until their CC ability and their damage output can really shine when they have items not how they are broken straight out the fcking gate. 

Revert the buff of Elandor. 

Remove Laville’s S2 slow and passive damage.

Nerf Paine insane damage output in the early game.

Nerf Keera S1 damage on the second time you press it and remove her damage block for 3 times in the ulti.

Nerf Zip. Extend the time he needs to consume his allies by 2 seconds. Limit the total number of people in his S2 to only 2 people and he can no longer consume minion or jungle creep.

Nerf Thane’s S1 and S2 CC. Its too much.

Increase Alice S3 cooldown and reduce the slow.

Nerf Florentino. Remove the mechanic where every S2 on a hero reduce his S1 cooldown. Alternatively I would nerf his ultimate so it no longer gives flowers. 

Nerf Yena. Make her heavy form damage reduction 30%. And reduce the base damage on her passive when she fills all the stacks.

NERF RICHTER. Revert the buff on his S2. 

Nerf Omen S2 damage reduction. I have to do it if the other big offlaners are nerfed. Omen would be unstoppable.

Buff Wonder woman. Increase healing on her shield passive and increase damage. Smoothen her skill animation.

BUFF ERROL. If his skill hit an enemy hero, it will now fill 2 stacks rather than 1. Increase the movement speed on his ultimate and you can choose when to land by tapping it again. Remove the -3% armour per stack. Change the restore % of HP lost from his skills into PLAIN HEALING. This healing will increase the more hero Errol hit with his skills. 

Buff Mganga. Make his ultimate global range.

Buff Azzenka. Change the way he cast ulti to the same way Alice cast her ulti. Give him 2 charges of S1. My intention is that I want him to excel at CC so theres a reason for people to pick him.

Buff Tara. Give her an extra effect on her passive. Tara has a maximum threshold of damage she can receive per hit. So she cannot be bursted to death and can tank abit more longer in fights.

Buff Arduin. Buff the casting time on all his skills. Make his passive have no cooldown. Increase his heal on his passive. Increase his s1 CC overall. S2 give more shield.

Buff Wiro. Make his revival passive be affected by cooldown reduction. Return the stun to his S2 if he hit the enemy onto the wall. Increase his S2 range and hitbox. Make his S1 HP% per hit rather than just extra damage. This would promote him to be a better tank warrior.

BUFF AIRI. Make her S2 faster cast. Make it like a blink than a dash. Integrate her passive to S1. Give her a new passive: “Blood of the Dragon” Which makes her lifesteal on her auto attack and all her skills when her HP is below 40%. This passive has a cooldown of 60 seconds. This would make her OP but i dont care i love her."

And every god damned hero that's been released since Brunhilda has some sort of hard cc, whether it's a stun or a silence. In fact, out of the 98 heroes currently available in EU, only 8 of them do not have any form of hard cc. However, 50 of them have at least 2 different ways of applying hard cc (Preyta and Valhein are honourary members). This is a game where Chaugnar, a character with a fucking team-wide cc cleanse, hasn't been viable for the longest time. This is a game where the devs had to give Chaugnar's ult to a fucking item because there was no other way to deal with the ridiculous amount of game-swinging cc."
arenaofvalor,fpq2ufn,t1_fppn4c1,1588814060.0,"I also main Airi my brother. Used to be server’s best in thailand a year ago(no one plays her as well lmao). Ive been flamed for years picking that hero because she has always been a low tier hero. Its pretty hard to outplay the new heroes as you said because they got so much effects and condition in their skillset. 

But eventually Airi will be better I believe. The next update the Dark slayer lane’s tower will be buffed so it dies slower until 5 minutes. This means Airi mains like us have more freedom roaming around the map to gank  early on."

Valhein and Butterfly really needs a buff to help in their early game because thats what they excel at. In the higher ranks I never seen them get picked because there are heroes that does their job better. Brunhilda’s early game is absolute garbage if you compare them to the likes of Capheny, Violet or Hayate. She cannot trade hits at all as she would always end up with less health. Also I said Wukong is bad because I feel like he is too unreliable in the early game to be useful to gank at all. In this current meta, if youre jungle doesn’t perform that well from 0-10 minutes into the game, you will have a hard time."

Heroes that needs buffs badly: Wonder Woman, Tara, Amily, Wukong, Celica/Brunhilda, Valhein, Wisp, Gildurr, Natalya, Preyta, Azzenka, Mganga, Butterfly, Omega, Wiro, Toro and Cresht

arenaofvalor,fpodq43,t3_gemrkq,1588782765.0,"Right now its unbalanced as shit. I can name 10 heroes that are broken in this patch. Mark of Frost is just cancer now like the son of Reaper’s blessing. The devs never look at how the talents should be adjusted because right now its only flicker, sprint and execute(excluding smite). Games are just way too fast in my opinion. I don’t really like how people just dies in 1 second. The sweet spot of how long a game should be for me is 17-25 minutes not 11-15 minute games. 

In higher ranks I see the same fucking hero every god damn game; always has to be at least a richter, dirak, laville or a raz. The problems for me now to climb ranks is that you HAVE TO PICK META HEROES. The off meta heroes are insta lose for you. You will become a burden to your team. They serve no counter pick what so ever and they are useless compared to the S tier heroes. As much as I love to pick Wiro to go roaming, you will lose. You have to pick Alice, Thane, Krizzix or Chaugnar if you wanted to win. 

I know the devs are working on buffing older heroes and reworking the blue enchantment branch and also there is a chance they might rework how CC works which is why I am still feeling hopeful about this game."

Also maybe an item that reduces 50% of all true damage.  I don’t think it would be broken because you have to waste a slot on it.

A damage threshold item would be nice too. This means that a person with this item would not receive more than the threshold per instance of damage. For example, it could be used to counter Violet who relies on bursting with one shot.

Mail of pain should be reworked so that it has an active effect. Perhaps, for three seconds of activation, it reflects 50% of damage taken in magic damage. With this though, the devs should allow more than 1 active item to be used at once since the new support item are all active. OR MAYBE JUST MAKE MAIL OF PAIN INTO A SUPPORT ITEM!

After the devs rework the WHOLE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF HOW CC works. Hopefully there will be less CC overall: SO an idea on how they should add a stat to the support item that reduces the resistance of the enemy by X%."

This meta is an early game brawling meta. You can’t play safe in the towers and wait for your heroes to go late game. If you do youll get dived and you will lose.
