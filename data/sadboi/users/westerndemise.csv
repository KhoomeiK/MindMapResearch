A point I want to make totally clear- if you’re a country whose economy is dependent on the West, then yeah, you can’t escape the West. Or the conglomerate of big economies, cause China’s not western... you (maybe?) see what I’m saying. But if you’re a country that can support itself, then why fall victim to an influence that you needn’t fall victim to?  Make a national Reddit... the French had Minitel, everyone’s got their own radio station infrastructure they can use for their own country-specific cultural needs... a country getting behind their own social media platforms is a choice of will, not resources. Y’all don’t have Verizon or AT&T, you have your own data networks.  No ones forcing you on this page or that, and no ones stopping you from making your own.

I have a few rambly questions/comments/concerns :  why do other countries feel the need to critique American politics?  Maybe from a recently colonized country (if you’re not super into capitalism and consumption idk what you’d call underdeveloped..) I get it, because American/Western politics totally drive the conditions of your country, but if you’re from NZ, then how is American politics yours to criticize?  Point of reference, way back when, I exchanged to France, far left Anarchist/Intellectual family (2002-3, Bush was president, we were going to Iraq, Franco-American relations were awful, I was personally held responsible for the invasion..). And they love American politics... like on a Kardashian level. Is it a “I look at them so I don’t have to look at myself” scenario?  I guess a tangential point is, if other countries are so tired of over exposure to American culture and social values, why don’t they just stop exposing themselves?  Write your own shows, drink your own soda, frequent your own chain restaurants, create your own pop music, get pissed at your own politics. Last scene in Camus’ The Stranger, the -tagonist (it’s complicated..) is being hanged and says that even if everyone shows up to the execution to scream hatred, at least he’s not dying alone. If others want the US not to matter, then the key is not to show up at the hanging. But talking about us only keeps us relevant. 

That’s just always my reaction when I read international opinions on national politics."

AskReddit,foermay,t3_e8bb7g,1587712395.0,"Post-18th Century Enlightenment, the trend has been more toward an individual sense of right and wrong than a community-based sense. Most movements support this trend, while most counter-movements fight it. An obvious example is that what used to be radical thought is now normal (gender equality, racial equality/mixing, secularization, workers’ rights, child-focused child rearing...). So, on one hand, in an era obsessed with “progress,” conservative thought is literally on the wrong side of history. If history is written, there are therefore writers... conservatives fighting against the march of progress are vilified by the writers, or the reality creators. And voila. 

If you’re talking right-left dichotomy as right = power to the powerful and left = power to the powerless, then the left, oppressive and authoritarian as it may become, is still theoretically motivated by a sense of justice and fairness, noble motivations. Also, the left is fueled by the idea that people can collaborate and change their environment, a humanistic desire which, again fuels our era, though this reaches back to the Renaissance.

Anytime you have a group of people doing something because that’s the time to do it, you’re going to have discipline and structure.  I’m not opposed to structure and discipline, I am just opposed to it coming from or serving the state. Community elders, education, spiritual teachings... every culture has discipline and structure. The only ones who didn’t were Rousseau’s wet dream Noble Savages. 

Grades... it’s a tool to see how well the teacher is teaching. Ideally, the teacher uses them as an assessment of his or her teaching. Also, students are motivated by competence and this gives them a tangible piece of evidence on how well they’re grasping the material. It’s an accountability measurement... for both the student and teacher. As for it being moral... i think it depends on the environment or the context, but the grades themselves, isolated from application, are just a tool.

Anarchism,fnwqaec,t3_g4asxl,1587323336.0,"Other comments said it pretty well, but here’s my two-cents. 
Obedience isn’t always the best thing in the world, but cooperation and pro-social behaviors are typically admirable, assuming they’re toward an ethical end. With my limited experience in the classroom, I can tell you I’m not huge on coercive authority, as much as I’m big on accepting responsibility for the consequences. If you don’t want to do the assignment, fine, it’s a 0, but don’t stop others from working... that’s where I draw the ethical line. If you’re making a bunch of noises while I’m trying to teach (easily distracted... it’s not a power trip as much as it’s a practical “please don’t”) then I’ll let you know you’re be distracting  and ask you not to. Continue, and consequences follow.  I just ask that students look me in the eye and own what they’re doing when they’re called out on doing it. 

I need students to be independent thinkers, but I also need them to be mindful. And I’ve not gone super deep into anarchist thinking, but I’d imagine that any forward-moving society that’s not reliant on the coercive state for guidance would need to balance their liberty with the mindful practice thereof."

Now, multiculturalism doesn’t bother me... I understand fears surrounding it aren’t necessarily about skin tone, but about losing one’s culture. French philosophy is one of many examples of western culture that I’m proud as a European descendant to embrace as part of a collective identity I (choose to?) belong to.  The American constitution, an American ideal of self sufficiency, an American philosophical framework grounded enough in fact and reason that it’s applicable to all cultures and social structures (individual and collective balance, self interest and the importance of sustainable long term goals, basically Enlightenment beliefs practiced in a way that doesn’t result in condescending to, or exterminating indigenous people)... these are all things that I, an American with a 400-year family history here, am proud of that aren’t dependent on, and may actually make room
for, if not transcend others’ races, religions, or cultural heritage.  Yep, my values put in practice resulted in slavery, native extermination, and exploitative big business. But it also resulted in seeing slavery, genocide, and exploitation as bad. I’m choosing to focus on that, while of course, not burying my head in the sand. 

I can’t help but wonder if you’re trolling though, though I hesitate to ask because I’d like to take your concerns seriously, for your sake.  I suggest you find what’s important to you, and see why you feel it’s so apt to be taken from you by others. Realize what your values are, see why and where they’re threatened; if these threats aren’t just you being scared, but are, in fact, the personal practice of your actual values being threatened, then live your own (ethical!) struggle to see to their proper defense. But killing your self over multiculturalism is silly."

Sibling was scapegoat and reveled in my misfortune any chance they got.  As far as living a lie... my experience hasn’t lined up with that... in all actuality, now that I’m thinking about it, the whole dynamic was “you’re great cause you’re good at school, but you’ve got an uphill battle to our full respect because you’re a bit fruity,” so it wasn’t totally a golden child thing, as much as a conditional love/triangulation thing.  The real problem was it drove a wedge between me and my sibling. Parents were abusive to her and lenient on me, and the rest is pretty textbook. There used to be guilt but then sibling grew up to be exactly what they said she’d be, and we just cut contact.

Either way, some soul searching is in order- either to undo the bad, accommodating habits you’ve learned that will only make you a target in your future relationships, or to see what may be toxic and hurtful within yourself, and to learn to undo them, and replace them with healthier strategies.  

I’ve said this before maybe on another sub, but forgiveness is for you not other people. My sister never forgave and it ate her the fuck up... you can forgive and move on without people, but you still need to forgive. In my opinion, which again, is really nobody’s."

I’m 34 y/o male, moved back home after breaking up with my N-ex boyfriend at 30. Grad school, part time retail.. the only thing I ask for is a roof and deliberately don’t ask for (though still receive) much else. Phones paid.  Foods available where I work and I eat 2/3 meals there, if I want to make something at home I buy ingredients.   They don’t ask for rent, and it wouldn’t make sense to because it would still be “my house my rules,” which seems like having cake and eating it too. 

If not N, then certainly problematic mother and I are close, and I share a lot of thoughts with her- I know it’s not safe but it’s certainly habit.  We have talked extensively about N-ex, manipulation and my hatred for it, and recognizing/admitting being abused (shameful for a guy, kinda..). Tonight, boyfriend (not N-ex) was over. I came downstairs after sending a frustrating series of emails to school admin to get started on my required internship, got a bowl of Oreos, and asked Mom if she still needed me to take the dogs out. Because it’s raining and muddy, she thought it would make more sense to take them for a walk (no sarcasm, legit that’s what happened). I got a little huffy. She pulls me aside and says I’m acting like a spoiled brat. I respond by telling her she’s being disrespectful, and that what could be a 10-15 min task is now a 30 minute endeavor. I was literally in the middle of getting snacks to go downstairs to watch TV with my bf, whom I see 2 days a week, on our shared days off.  She says “look at you,” and I say “you’re just doing this cause you can.”  She calls me manipulative. She ends up taking the dogs out, on a walk, in the rain. I offer to go with- she’s got a bad knee- she says no. Fine, end of it. 

What sucks is the child/parent dynamic is all done by choice. Don’t smoke in the house, sure. No eating in the room, get it. But the utter need for control... it just screams emptiness inside, and I’ll tell you.. I’m tired of “understanding” it.   Sorry they’re wounded, and yeah it’s their house, but damn... have a sense of mindful justice. It’s not difficult, and certainly in line with how highly they think of themselves.  Keep in mind i am, in fact, helpful. Just that wasn’t the time and it shouldn’t have been the time, and I’m not going to be called manipulative for hands-in-pockets, controlled-tone mentioning that that wasn’t the ideal time to spring a mandatory walk in the rain on someone. 

Anyway, what brought me here was this: I couldn’t even scratch my ass in front of them without them wondering why I was using that finger and not the other one. You can’t do anything in front of them without getting their opinion and yeah, it makes for a fair amount of anxiety that other people just don’t get (I haaaaaate being watched.. but I test really well). 

Thanks for letting me rant."

depression,f7rb85s,t3_dxjik1,1573978164.0,"Parents give us the struggles, and our mission is to grow enough to fight them. If you speak French, I’m thinking of the verb-phrase “lutter contre.”
I know that’s a declarative statement, and I’m nobody, much less anyone to make blanket statements on mental health, but that has been my experience. I have very generous parents (Thank God) but they also weren’t the most mindful when I was dealing with depression and handling the stresses of finding my way after college (enter snowflake accusations, and you may well be right). Either way, they set me up for a whole lot of failure, and I learned (as relates to my own journey) that, blame them or not, I had to live my life, and their accountability or lack thereof could not be a variable in my happiness. It’s not the cards you’re dealt, but how you play them— I say that, again, from a position of privilege. The specific point that I think applies, is they may have screwed you, but you’re the only one who can unscrew yourself.  That’s what you have to focus on if you want to grow into happiness. Or okayness, or not depressedness. 

Also my sister never let go of her hate and she’s a bobblehead-looking drug addict now, with no relationship with any family besides a very tenuous online presence with her daughter. That also informed my mindset."
