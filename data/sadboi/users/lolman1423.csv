Well the interesting thing that ties this up to the missing 411 i believe is there are said to be able to escape that place if they take off their clothing and turn them inside out, that may explain why some of those that are found (dead or alive for some reason i dont know) are totally naked and some of their clothing are found in much more prestine condition than the time and weather should alow. i dont remember where i read it, but i will update this if i find it. i am not joking or trying to spread fake information so take this with a grain of salt.
