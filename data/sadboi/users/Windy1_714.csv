DelphiMurders,fr0ptn0,t1_fqz18el,1589803567.0,"Same. Trick knee or something. Walks like many a trucker I know with old injury / bad knee. Years of sitting behind the wheel, they all have a unique walk when they get out for a minute. Not like the carpenter who's moving all day. They stiffen up in the driver's seat endlessly & it's a lame hobble noticeably different from a fluid limp. (I dunno how to describe, my best attempt here!). 

Specifically one I know well, always comes to mind, the walk, the clothes, general appearance (1st sketch) - nowhere near Delphi to be clear - but very similar appearance, which makes it hard for me to dismiss a trucker. 

I don't see the half of what others do in the clip. But they said focus on mannerisms. In a what 2? second clip? Somebody knows that stance / walk & knows it is unique only to whomever. Just like I know my trucker bud w/ trick knee from a mile away. Yup, from football. Got in a rig straight out of HS. Here we are, hobbling along, lol.

I have an ex who was amazing at this. It's been decades & I still tell ppl about it. First piece of jewelry he wanted to get me diamonds, a ring, I wrinkled my nose & explained why I prefer anything but. Over a year he randomly asked questions about different gems & jewelry pieces. I was oblivious, just convo of the moment. Sucker was taking notes! 

For my birthday almost a year after 1st convo he gave me my dream piece. I knew as soon as I saw it, all those random chats... He invested so much time & thought, did his homework, best gift I ever got. It was perfect & exactly what I wanted, though most would've preferred his idea. He did this w/ everything. Want a new jacket? He would get to the last stitching detail exactly what I wanted. 

So the ring has to go back / be sold. But remember how important it is & means more than any object - the thought that went into choosing it. Often the perfect gift is not the expensive option. But the pain in the ass one to find."

Can't pick up on references if I hadn't read of them yet. 

This is just my point of view but it all culminates into The Tower & there you begin to see, there is a whole world / world order? behind this. King is trying to tell you of it, but it isn't a story that could be written on it's own start to finish, no matter how many pages. But a world can be built brick by brick or phrase by phrase through many books. Maybe we each discover something a bit different. 

All these readers ruining your lovely plans of delving into the DT are really trying to make sure you get the full deal. It can be read 1st or alone. But much is lost on the reader as they have no idea the connection. There's a reason he started writing it early on but shelved it while he cranked out a multitude of others.  All the while thoughts of the DT as he told other stories.

Grew up in Maine & an avid reader since forever. King ties many bits n bobs from one story to another. The more of him you read, you go - wait a sec, wasn't that also in Tommyknockers? Or whichever stage you are at. 

The Dark Tower series really (just my opinion) is the core & crown jewel to this but the most challenging to unravel (for me). I struggled with it at first. Set it aside & plowed through The Stand. Then a few others. Went back to it many years later & loved it.  But I would not have if I'd started there. So, I highly recommend The Stand first. 

Yes DT stands alone. But if you enjoyed IT that much & get deeper into King & start seeing the threads & characters that overlap book to book... You will definitely thank yourself for it. I would also highly recommend Needful Things, AFTER you've gotten through a good variety of his books. Save it for dessert. You understand it's hard to stop at the 10th King book? or 20th or...

I can only get credit from the vendor IF I have all 24 in a case. Against state law for them to credit partial cases. So if I have 3 other 6pks & a couple loose of same flavor, I'll get credit. 90% of time I have 21 (unless it's Bud) = no credit.

Why complicate? State regs & taxes. You sound just like every customer who ever approached to make said return. Spot on with common sense. Common sense & state regs rarely mix here.

The same simple details / facts explained, with linked articles / docs get brought up endlessly. Simple example with no offense to anyone (we all get excitable & post ahead of ourselves sometimes.

Dates of his charges / convictions & references to the law / regs in Indiana were shared. More ppl commented ""if he's a convicted..."" More ppl kindly explained. Rinse & repeat. More ppl will comment tomorrow, ""But his dna should be on file"" and on it goes.

Read everything I can find, pop in here, WS, twitter, etc to find links to more reading.

I will watch video of the locale if available. Times when reading isn't an option, I do enjoy a well done professional factual podcast, like on a long drive. I got hooked with S* Town & none since really compare but there are a few gems in the rubble. For the most part if I've done my homework, it's just a recap, so I look for ones where I don't know the case. If it's not of interest, great, saved me 18 months of digging links.


I prefer the old days pre-youtube. The discussions were far better, more in depth & packed with info. Now folks discuss the folks discussing the case. Meh. What is getting lost is - many on true crime boards aren't reading anything themselves & basing things on what someone else's perception was in their limited recap that leaves out lots of factual info.

We've had to seriously alter cow's milk to try & make it digestible for grown humans. Milk is designed by nature to nurture the young.

We've had regular access to milk since the 1st human gave birth. So have all mammals.

Of course they do! Predators don't pick n choose the backstrap & leave the rest. They drink the milk & blood first before it is wasted. Predators don't waste food & drink if they don't have to.
