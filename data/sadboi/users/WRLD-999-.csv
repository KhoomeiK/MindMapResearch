benzodiazepines,fhvr5s3,t3_f4xoo9,1581900384.0,"With myself being a schizophrenic, I have probably around 400 quels sitting around lol I never took my meds, because they were fucking horrible. Any antipsychotic basically carries no Rec use whatsoever. It’ll knock you the fuck out, but that’s about it. No euphoria, no pleasant feelings relating to your body/mind. Best bet would be to sell those bitches off if you know anyone dumb enough to buy em. The WD’s are fucking horrible with them, too, so if you start taking them, be ready for one hell of a time. Almost comparable to Benzo WD, but with a lot more puking lmfao. 

TL;DR - take them if you wanna knock the fuck out, but other than that seroquel has 0 recreational use imo. Only time they’re helpful (if you don’t have a psychotic illness) is to kill a trip. Works wonders."
