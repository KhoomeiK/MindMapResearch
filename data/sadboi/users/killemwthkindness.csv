That's like, the typical narcissist unfortunately... I learnt that the best thing to do is to say nothing with people like that, but... it's easy to say.

I don't even eat with my parents anymore, because of my dad (because of what he's wathing, like stupid stuff, the tv informations, some stupid movies or programs he ""likes""... and because of everything he can say, or do when I eat with them).

I haven't thought about that (the fact that it is an intimate relationship, because of what I can/had/will share with her) but it's good to think like that, because you're right. I think I rely too much on the fact that she helped me at the beginning when I met her, because she was the only one in my life who told me ""I'm worried about your mental health more than your training class""... and I had like, a good support from her and still do, now that I am stopping this training class who made me even more depressed for a couple of months.  
But I guess she's not the only one who could help me. Right now, in some way, she's the only one... but I will try to find someone else, so I won't have to wait again for an appointment I guess.

You're right, I can't change right now because of the covid, but... I will try to find another psychologist. In my country, some psychologists are free, so she's my second psy where I live and I don't know if there could be anyone else to help me as a psychologist... but I will see.

But watching all those hypocrites giving a price or even nominate Polanski in the César is a shame. Why should we support him ? As you said, there is no ""there is the man AND the artist"" like, in France right now, we don't think like that about politicians for example. There is one more scandal about politics and people are like ""yes this man is horrible"" and ""this thing"" like, separating the artist from the man, is just a cinema/music/artistic thing. A rapist baker, politcian or even teacher would just be a rapist, even if the dude (or woman) is ""good"" at his/her work.  


We should NEVER blame the victims or feel sorry for the agressors/rapists. They know exactly what they did and what they are doing when they do it. Polanski is not the only one to blame, Woody Allen disgust me as well, and he's not the only one. I guess I understand absolutely what you feel, I feel embarrassed so much because, it is my country too and I love movies and cinema, and seing that France accept to nominate Polanski for example, is not normal."

LetsNotMeet,ffg9yhd,t1_ffexpnp,1579901640.0,"Oh I didn't knew that acting like this girl did, could have actually saved her life... but I really meant that, the point is, sometimes you don't know the person who is a threat to you. Like, it could be a member of your family, a ""friend"", an enemy or a complete stranger. Either way, it's hard to know what could work for you to stay alive and stay away from the person in question.

And I know (I have experienced it once, even if it wasn't on purpose) that acting like ""crazy"" or like the girl you mentioned did, trying to be a threat to the threatening person, could work. Of course you'll never know until one day, if it happens to you, wish I hope won't happen to anyone, but, we'll never know.

And the thing that I did that could have force people to stay away from me was during an afternoon, in a crowded place. I was out of my meds (I try to heal from something that, I believe, will never heal from, but whatever) and the fact that I was out of my meds made me feel like I've been taking drugs (like heroin, or LSD or anything, I don't really know because I never tried any drugs, but I did and still am taking meds, and it can have a really bad effect on you sometimes) but still, I felt like I needed my dose, and because I couldn't had it, I was walking and walking like, in a short space (it was outside but it was a short place and people were walking by there but, when they saw me, they walked very fast because they thought, I think, that I was on drugs, and could be dangerous). And the fact is, I was not dangerous but looked like I had serious mental issues and was crazy/dangerous. Just looked like that. I wasn't in danger and I don't know how I could even reproduce that if I will ever be on a bad situation again in my life, but it is good to know that some things can be scary. Because it could also scare someone who wants to do bad things to you. Because the person who is a threat can be on drugs, crazy, revengeful, ill, ""normal"" but a bad person, or anything else. And yes, of course, some things you could do might not work according to the person you're facing.

But I really believe that while you experience the bad situation, you have and idea of what to do to stay alive. It's a human thing to do. When we feel the danger, we try our best to stay alive. It could be screaming for help. It could be stabbing a watermelon. It could be telling a lie. It could be crying. It could be anything. You could escape it, or face it because you have no choice. I lived some horrible things and I wasn't able to escape some times, so I've been lying to people most of the time. Pretending I was okay, or fine, or felt safe, when I felt in danger.

Sorry for the long comment. Here's the story I was talking about https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/e79dkf/lost_in_baltimore_and_saved_by_a_lie/ I really don't know how this girl could have lied so well, and that she was ""fine"" after that, but I'm really glad that she was this brave and lucky to escape a possible dangerous situation. 

And I know that my other comment was taken wrong (and I felt like a total mess for it an entire day and night, but I never meant to hurt anyone. I can't know how everyone could escape dangerous situations or people, I'm not a psychic or a god. I had my issues too and I'm sorry I probably hurt at least one perso, but I was just trying to give an ADVICE. I was trying to help, not to kill anybody. This just made my life worse. Just the answers to my comment which was an advice. But well, what is done is done. Sorry for you OP btw, it's kind of absolutely off topic but I needed to had it out of my chest

And thank you for sharing your story btw, I truly think that reading and sharing all of that on this sub could help some of us some day.

Look at the other subs too that people in the comments told you to check, I believe they will (also) help you. Please, stay alive.

It's a big problem and they're not helping me at all with my depression, they don't know what to do with a depressed child/sister and they kind of do a lot of things that doesn't help. I know that my mom and brother don't do it on purpose because they think they're helping me, even if they're not helping at all. My dad is a big issue and he said and did at least three things that made me feel almost as bad as I way yesterday evening.   


It's just that, I feel like I really need a plan right now. To stop being around. To not be there anymore. Guess I should post on another subreddit, but one of my big fault is to ask for help and when people are kind enough to read me and give me advice, kind words or try to help me, I feel like I need some energy and motivation to answer. I felt like that with your comment. I just thought nobody would even dare to read me, and would even less try to answer me because, I don't matter. But yet, here I am. I am answering you because you've been nice to me, and you don't have to feel bad or anything else, because your comment is really nice and I can feel that you seem like a kind person, and even if I think I already said it at least once, thank you. I know that most of the time, when we write, people could get us wrong because we can't show emotions or anything else while writing, so you'll never know how people will receive what you are saying, and that's what happened to me yesterday.   


To protect myself, I just blocked this person (I actually tried to answer twice to her comments, but I thought that it could get worse so I just delete what I've been writing and block her). It's not mean and it would be better for her too if I made her feel bad, but, that's also one of my biggest fault. I think so much about what other people feel that, when I know that I've hurt somebody (even if this person hurt me really, really much, even if she REALLY made me wanna die, which happened in the past and never really left me - this ""feeling"" and those thoughts because of them I mean -) I just feel guilty, and because I'm depressed, I feel like karma exists but works only for me. Even if I am kind, that I tell all the time (well, a lot) to people that matter to me that I love them and why they are special and awesome and they deserve the best, all the time (which is a thing I do with strangers too, IRL and on the internet), I just have my stupid depression that hits me back with everything I feel and felt and I think about like, some people I hurt in the past (including a psycho and her psycho mom) and I just feel like, it's unfair. Because I never wanted to hurt anyone in purpose, even tho a lot of people did it on purpose to me.   


I'm sorry I am talking about all of that to you, you don't deserve to have to answer all of that, so don't worry if you don't, or if you just post a short answer. I promise you that in any case, I won't feel bad because you would do so. I know I talk too much and it's not really fair to, to the people that helped me, even if it was just by answering to a post, like you did. So I will just say thank you another last time, I wish you a lot of good things are happening to you or will happen to you. I don't know you of course, but well. Even if I was trying to be nice yesterday with my advice and just ended feeling suicidal, right now I just feel like I just want to be kind to you, like you've been to me, so, I hope that I didn't bother you too much and that you will have a good day, evening or night."

You'll never know. It's like when you are reading stories on this subreddit and think of ""what would I do if it would happen to me ?"" well, you can't be sure until you might experience it some day.

But then I've reading your comment, and I have to think that you got something here. I don't know if it would help our OP, but it's a lovely and good comment. My best friend always (when I talk bad about myself and tell him I don't want to be there anymore) told me and tell me the beautiful things I have done for him, the support I gave him, how beautiful he thinks him and his boyfriend think I am, and he tries to tell me as much positive things and qualities as possible, so I can have a different vision of me. And even if I know that I too feel like a burden to everybody around me, like you OP, I hope that still, you have or will have people around you (or even here, like GlitteringDay04) that will tell you the beautiful things they can see about you.   


Of course, we don't know you. I won't tell you ""be glad you're alive"" or ""it will be okay"" because nobody knows what would happen to anyone, and nobody wants to hear that, I hate it myself when people tell me that. Even if they're my friends or family. But I get you. I don't know how to deal with my life anymore, because of so many things that continue to make me ""feel"" depressed (I've been depressed for more than ten years) and I know too, that I could have died at least twice. When I was 13 and three I believe, four years ago, so I was probably 22 or something like that (yes I'm bad at math). And I've been living a living hell after all that, and many times I've been thinking that, I should have end my life. But the thing is that you'll never know what could happen. Being alive, even if it feels so bad and so painful, is an opportunity. Now that we're there on this planet and life, perhaps we could be helpful to others or even just to ourselves. And I don't believe that you should die. I don't know you, and I won't say that anybody deserves to die, because I am in no position to judge anyone, that's a fact.  


But you can (if you still haven't do so) try to do what the comment below me said, and try to find the good things about you. Yes, we don't know you, but if you have post this here, it's because you might want something that could help. Kind words, understanding people, anything. I'm not a good help even if I would want to, because I feel like you many times and my life is trash, but, you probably matter to someone. It's not selfish what you want to do by the way, but please, give yourself chances. Each time you will think about ending your life. You never know what would happen to you. What if someday, you will feel better ? You don't know that, but it could be a possibility. Try to be kind to you, always. Don't lose hope, please."

socialanxiety,feyzh5d,t1_fewm7h3,1579452398.0,"You're right for the trolls, they don't go after people for personal reasons I believe. I so most of the trolls on YouTube, like, since I've got internet on my computer (so it's been a really long time). But this is so easy to just piss people off for them that they spend time doing that, and it's stupid. I don't believe I have ever met one that was like attacking me on a subject, but I'm still sorry for you OP.  


But yet, the best way to deal with them is like you said PeachyNola : to ignore them. Then, they don't really got any power over you. And it's surprising how many subs there are on Reddit, like I only followed one before I registered, and I found that there are many that I didn't knew even exist. I'm sure a lot of them have good and kind people on it and don't attract those trolls.  


Thank you for answering me also, I hope that I won't really met any trolls, and if I do, I will try to ignore them, because that's the best we can do I guess."

Oh thank you ! I haven't look everywhere yet, I will take this with me, there are some terms that I didn't get from other subs as well.   
So, to answer your question, I am personally still living with my narcissist parent (because right now, I don't really have the choice) so I guess I can't really relate. I don't even know if I could stop seeing or contacting this parent ever, because of some things, but well, sorry that I can't really answer your question.  


I don't know if that would help, but, one time (in 2012) I almost lost this parent, that had an accident and was in a hospital in the section where the most emergency patients were. For almost an entire day, I didn't knew if I would lost one of my parent, the one that I learn just like five or six weeks ago, that it was a narcissist pervert person. I hated this parent so, so much, and I know that when I thought that I could lost this one, I just get really concerned and felt bad for having our first big argument ever, a few weeks ago (the nightmare was just beginning at the time, I just didn't knew it). I could saw this parent like, three weeks later for the first time since the accident, and the first thing this parent did, was yelling at me and belittle me. So, to this day, I thought that (and I might be wrong, I guess I might discover it someday perhaps) I would never feel any empathy to this person ever again. And I am a highly sensitive person, I empathize a lot, and I'm a really kind and loving person. But it was at this moment that I realize that even if this parent was alive, it felt like this person was just not a person anymore. I don't know how I would react if I know about the loss of this parent. Guess my feelings will just win and I will cry, because that's a human thing to do... but I don't know. I guess it depends of all the things this parent put you through during your life, and why you might have cut him/her off of your life. I won't give any example, but I know that if my parent (or anyone else, even if some people did terrible things to me) does or have ever done something like, physically to me, I would not ever give a damn about this person being dead. Because in my opinion (and it's only what I believe) some things can't just be forgiven.   


Also, I know that I'm not in the situation that was requesting your question, but well, I wanted to answer because it might maybe help in any way ? I don't really know, sorry if I just made you lose your time while reading my comment if it does not belong here at all in the first place (my comment I mean)"

socialanxiety,feuuyvu,t3_eqnbu1,1579390223.0,"I am new to Reddit (I loved one sub so I've been reading this one for three weeks or so, and yesterday I thought that I would join Reddit, so I could perhaps comment from time to time or maybe post anything, but sorry, not the point) so I don't know (yet, maybe) what you are referring to. It might also depend of the subs you were joining, and I'm sorry if all of that made you feel that bad, even if that's absolutely not my fault.  


I know what you mean by feeling lonely, and that because you're nice to people, they should be nice to you. I know it doesn't work like that but if we really should have what we're spreading (like kindness) it would be so great. I know that I try to be kind to everyone (but sometimes I'm not because I feel too bad, and because I am also highly sensitive, I feel like sometimes, everything and everyone is against me, and it feels so hard to live sometimes, but still, we are living are we deal with it).  


For how long have you been on Reddit like, commenting and posting ? I don't know if you should stay or not because I can see that it's not good for you maybe to stay here, but maybe you could check other stuff (I don't know if I am allowed to talk about it, but like, tumblr ? I love it, you can find so much things on it and it's really cool) but also, I hope that I won't find some trolls around on Reddit too, because reading your post made me feel a bit scared that I could read mean comments answering to mine or something else. And as I am commenting your post I realize that I talk too much about me, sorry for that. I was just trying to say that I think I understand, and I don't know if it's better for you to stay or leave, but anyway, I hope that you will find kind and nice people around. It's important to think about how we feel, always. If it's not harming anyone of course.  


But I have to told you that internet could also (because I just saw the other comment under your post) have nice things on it. To me, tumblr is one of these things. It's hard to find people to talk to or that would follow you, read you perhaps or understand you but it's a good place. Reddit feel like a new thing to me, and I haven't got any real interaction here yet and I feel like everything that I had post is not even read by other people, or that perhaps, people think that it's not important, or maybe I haven't help anyone, and it makes me feel bad because, it might be selfish perhaps, but I really want to help when I could. I don't know if you even want any help or else, and I am pretty sure talking about another website on my comment is not right but I don't think it's not allowed so, it could not be that bad too. And I'm sure you already knew tumblr or even is on it or following some, but still. I don't know a lot of nice place, people or website (maybe BuzzFeed ?) that could also make you feel better.   


But trust me, even if it's easy for those trolls for example to write mean things behind a computer, it doesn't mean you don't deserve to find some place or some social network or someone or anything else that could make you feel better. There is always something I hope, we just might not know it yet. I didn't even went on Reddit before I really give it a try three weeks ago (kind of) and, now that I joined it, I have found some subs that might be helpful. (I don't feel good here for the moment, but like I said, I'm new so I don't know how it will be to be honest)  


Anyway, no matter what you will decide, I hope you'll find peace and nice things and kind people. Really glad you also have something IRL to talk too, it really helps sometimes."
13ReasonsWhy,feoslga,t1_feoeg1b,1579304828.0,"I have to agree, I don't see why it would be a good point... I know that a lot of people hate Clay apparently, but still, he really doesn't deserve to die, like, not at all"

Of course I understand why I shouldn't had say that, because like I said in some way, I don't know you so I don't know you or your life of anything else at all)  


And also, I'm sorry if something I had say hurt you in some way. It wasn't my intention at all. Hope that you have found or will found some help in any way, no matter what"
SuicideWatch,feo8dfo,t1_feo2xnz,1579296500.0,"As I said, I already thought about suicide too. I had an ultimatum from my family like, one or two weeks ago, I don't even know anymore. They told me that they wouldn't leave me like this, thinking about suicide, and just, stopping my training class. I also have social anxiety and don't feel good at all at my training class cause I HAVE to act like I'm okay, I have to laugh at my ""coworkers"" jokes and smile as mush as I can do, because, I know that if I don't do that, they will judge me (and they already did and I felt like a mess all day, today actually) because I haven't smile or laugh this morning, at a stupid joke that wasn't funny at all. And I had a shitty day.   


My ultimatum was : continuing my training class OR going to a psychiatrical hospital. I never have been in a PH and even if I have thought about it, I would rather die than go for it. Because I don't know how they are like in your country, but in mine (and I believe, everywhere) it feels like it's a place for the craziest people, like murderer and some other bad people, that could be really dangerous. And I couldn't do anything else, so I decided to continue my training class, even if I feel bad all day, and all evening, and had nightmares for years (like real nightmares, not weird and fictional ones, you know ?)  


My point is, where I live, if you try to kill yourself (and fail, because trust me, not everyone just do it and ""succeed"" to do so, you WILL be directly leading to a psychiatric hospital (I don't know the exact term, sorry, english is not my first language). And I know one thing : if you're there because you tried to kill yourself, they will watch every move you make and will take you at your word when you will speak. You may think that you're life is hell, and I know how it feels, even if I don't feel what you are feeling right now, and even if I did, it wouldn't be for the same reasons I guess. But what I mean is, you are, in some way, free. You can talk a walk, you can take a nap, you can talk to someone maybe, you can make a call, you can try to find help (I don't know if you tried to talk to a doctor, if you ever tried any meds or something else) but I'm sure there is at least one good thing you haven't thought about, and that could help. I'm not saying it would make you happy or make you feel good, but it could help you feeling better. And that's important. You have to try, for you, to feel better, one more time. And every time that you will feel like it's the last, then, instead of wanting to kill yourself, why don't you decide what you want to do with your life while you're alive ?  


You want to quit your job and you can change to another, or maybe become a student (again perhaps) or going to a friend's/family member's place to try to feel safer, better and feel that you are not alone ? You want to be helpful ? Go to a shelter for example. Walk dogs, pets cats. Make someone smile. Find good memes on the internet, new YouTube channels to follow, a new tv show to watch, go seing a movie even if you're all alone. Wait for the oscars if you like movies and like the ceremony. Think about what could happen next in your life if you give it a try, and in the lives of your loving ones. Maybe a friend will get married and you will go to the ceremony and be happy in this day. Maybe you will meet someone new or an old friend or family member, contact somebody that you like but haven't talked to in a while. Do things. Take care. Find as many reasons as you can to stay alive, to BE alive. You are alive. It seems like a living hell, but you could turn it to a safer place, but it might demands change. Moving to another city for example, cut off some toxic things, people or other things in your life.  


I don't know you or your situation or your life, and I'm just a stranger. But I know that some times in the past, when I wanted to kill myself, strangers on the internet or in real life made me change my mind. I lived some good moments. No happy ones, I don't know what happiness is, but still. I have seen greats movies that I loved and that made me cry or made me feel so much love for the movies that I saw, or the show that I loved, or the music that I listened. Everyday I try to spread some love and some kind words to one person at least. Anybody, really. In real life or in the web. I have to do it. Because, I have a thing, and I don't know the english term for that if that even exists, and it makes me feel like I have to be a hero. To me, and to other people. People that often, don't ask for help. I haven't read twice your post, but I haven't saw any word that actually said ""change my mind please"" or ""help"". I might be wrong, but yet, here I am. Like I said, I am only a stranger, and trust me, I know that even if I promise you that you will find happiness for sure in the future, like, I just know it, I have proof and I can show you, you wouldn't trust me. Because right now, it's hell. Right now, you don't wanna give it a try anymore. Life is exhausting, and life don't stop for a moment, and give you help just because you need some. Life hit you and in some way, things or / and people will make you fall. It's easy to fall. It's harder to rise.  


But you can do it, I hope so and I really want you to think about it. Think about the rising part. Make your life a journey. Make what you live a fight that you will do anything to win. Are you a loser ? No. You're the protagonist of a story. Your story. And it's worth reading, and I'm pretty sure people want to know what happens next in the future in this story. And for that, it needs a future. As I said, life can hit you sometimes. For what I know, I could die from a heart attack in five minutes, or die in my sleep when I will turn 87. Of course, if you commit suicide (or try, at least) you will think you got the power to chose this moment. But you won't even be sure to succeed. And trust me, you don't want to miss your aim. So please, please, please, don't do it. Try again, to live. To find help. To also help other, when you could do it. You are important. You worth it.  


Please, don't go. I don't know you, but I sure don't want to believe that you're already gone, or will be gone in a few hours or days. And I don't want you to feel guilty either because I told you to think about the people who love you. But you have to think about them. Because they are important too, and they could take a great part in your story, the story of your life. So please, don't stay alone. Talk. Even if it's on the internet, for a couple of days. It won't hurt. Take your time if you can, and fight back life. Show it that you deserve to have a better present and future. Nobody should ever try or think to commit suicide. I know it's unfair, and that we're a few people to think about it, try it, and unfortunately in some way, succeed to do it. But we are there, and to all of us who are still alive, we have to try. Always.  


I don't know if anything I could have said would have help you, but I can only finish this comment by telling you that you need a hero. And you have to be your own hero. Because you deserve to be one, and you deserve to be saved."
SuicideWatch,feo2xnz,t3_eq4j3o,1579294418.0,"I am new to reddit (I mean, I joined reddit like, this evening because in my country it is 9pm but we don't care) and I am depressed since I am 12 (I will turn 26 next month unfortunately) and I thought about killing myself many times, and I never (even when I really wanted so much to die) tried to do it. You might already know what I will say, and you may have really good reasons not to listen to me, but well, if I could perhaps help you, then I will.  


I believe that in this world, there is at least one person that loves us. It might be your mum, a friend, a teacher (in a kind way, not a creepy or crazy way of course), I mean, it could be anybody. If you have at least one person that loves you, and if you know that deep in your heart, despite those suicidal thoughts you have, you love this person as well, then, think about that : how will this person discover what would have happened to you if you do it ? What would this person feels ? I believe that if you have at least one person that you might think of, you could know that it could break his/her heart. I'm not saying that so you could feel some pressure besides what you want to do. I am saying that because, even if you feel like your life really don't worth it, and that nobody would feel sad or heartbroken if you die, then, I believe that you're wrong.  


I don't know you of course, but I know that feeling, like you try to ""enjoy"" your last moment on this earth and that there is no hope anymore. I won't judge you or anything else, I will only tell you that the future is unknown, and you have to give it a shot. Always. Now is not the time, please. I'm sure you have tried to find help, but even when we feel there is nothing that would help us anymore, I have to believe that, something will work. You worth it. You're precious. Be kind to yourself, try to love yourself more than the fact that you don't feel like you belong on this planet or life anymore. Show yourself, show everyone, show to this life that you deserve happiness and love. Give some love, some kind words to the people you love, hug the people you could hug if you have some, cry if you need to, but please, don't let yourself down.

13reasonswhyhate,fenwk2j,t3_cxzht9,1579291931.0,"Hi there ! I'm new to reddit and wanted to find out what this subreddit was about, and, I loved the first season of this show and I won't try to defend it, even if, to me, this is one of my favorite tv show (but, only for the first season, really) Yet, I wanted to read your reasons and, I have to agree with you on some points (I don't even tried to see if you were wrong about the show, because you can think all of that and, even if I might not agree on everything, you've got really good points and iI need to talk about it, so I will quote you.  


""The gruesome suicide was shown in season 1 for a reason. And then, just like that, they cut out the scene after all the outcry. Take a fucking stand, Netflix."" I mean, yes, wtf ? To me, it was SO important they showed the suicide scene AND the moment the parents found her. Because, as a depressed person who unfortunately had thought about killing myself, I have thought of ""I can't do this because it will hurt at least, my mother"" but before I saw this scene, I NEVER thought of ""what happens when you do it ? what kind of reaction or actual thing is happening to the person or people who find you ? where do your body goes ?"" and it's so horrible to think of it, but this is SO important. Because, when I saw the season one, I was really thinking about killing myself, and not really for the same reasons as Hannah, but I was so like... I don't have the word, but, I was seing myself as Hannah as a character, and, when she died, I felt like I did it to my own parents. That when she was not there anymore (in the end of the last episode of season one, after the suicide scene I believe) I felt heartbreaking. Because I felt like I have commit suicide, and, well, of course... life goes on for everyone else. Like, you end your life and it could broke people's heart, but in fact, I believe, most of the people who loved you will, someday, forget about you. Not forever, but, they will ""accept"" the fact that you are just dead. And at the time, when I finished season one, I was like ""no, I won't do it. I can't do this, because I don't want people to forget about me, or move on, because right now, my life is important, and even if I hate it, I need to live. In a selfish way, because the show taught me that yes, people will move on and kind of forget you, but of course, also because it would break some people's hearts. I know it's not important to say all of that in a comment and I'm sorry it's already so long, but I felt like it was important to say that, like you said in your post, Netflix chose to cut the suicide scene. And when I heard about that and I had check, I felt like something was taken from me, like something important, that really mattered. And I was angry about it, and now that I read your post, I have to write it. Because yes, Netflix runs this show, and they should have keep this scene.

I will just finish my comment by saying that Ani is crazy. Nobody liked her character, and the third season shouldn't even exists, but... dating a rapist while knowing he raped girls and ""make"" one of them commit suicide in some way, it's really crazy. I don't know if people would actually do that, I hope not, but, I know for sure that nobody wants to see this in a tv show, and especially not 13 Reasons Why. I will just add too that you're right about something : the show is about a girl who commit suicide in the first place and I'm not sure but I think that in each episode, they are talking about (or at least, in every seasons, I don't know) the phone lines for people who ""wants"" to commit suicide, as if it was the answer. But what they apparently never thought of, is to include this in the show. I used only a ""chatroom"" (is that the good word ?) to talk to somebody once, three years ago, when I wanted to kill myself. Because I wanted to give it a try, and I would never have and I believe that I never will call those phone numbers for suicidal persons. And I was on the chat with a guy who, apparently, tried to told me to just ""don't commit suicide"" and to avoid myself from harming myself, and when I was at the end of our ""conversation"", all I wanted to do was harming myself, because, the way he talked to me was like a robot, and I felt so much worse at this moment and I thought ""what would ever happen if I call one of these numbers ?"" and I really want to know. The show could have show it, but they never did and I believe they never will. It's such a shame I think.

I'm so sorry for the long post, first comment ever on reddit and I didn't intend to do it that long, but I felt like I really needed to answer to your post and to talk about this. Also, english isn't my first language, so sorry for the weird sentences or bad choices of words. (and if you think my comment doesn't belong here at all, I will delete it if I could, like I said, first time here so, just saying)."
