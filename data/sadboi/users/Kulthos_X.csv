skeptic,ez83wnd,t3_d07nrd,1567733598.0,"The flu vaccine is interesting, as on the individual level it makes little noticeable difference to most people but on a wide-scale application it is very useful.  

On average you get the flu once every ten years (healthy adults get it less often than that) and the flu vaccine is 50% effective, so most people aren't going to notice the effect.  Some people get mild flu-like symptoms the day after the shot, giving them a negative impression of the vaccine.  The 50ish percent effectiveness of the vaccine means that herd immunity won't develop.  The 50ish percent effectiveness of the vaccine also means that there will be many millions of people who get the flu shot and still get the flu and may subsequently consider the vaccines useless.  

The thing is, if you give 300+ million people the shots, you are going to prevent something around 15 million cases of the flu, saving tens of thousands of lives, with a 50% effective vaccine.  Even if the vaccine is only 20% effective that is still a lot of prevented cases of the flu and many lives saved.  The flu shot is inexpensive and is worth doing.
