I told my psych and we would discuss it regularly for over a year before I got up the guts to tell my GP. My GP was extremely concerned and wanted me off my meds asap. He was scared I would kill myself by accident. I then told my pain specialist and asked her to continue writing my scripts but for them to be despensed 2 days at a time. Her reaction surprised me, she congratulated me and thanked me for being honest. It was a pretty awful experience and the day I told my GP I came home crying and considering suicide while self harming. It's been about 3 months and things have settled down. I have been sick this month and the doctors aren't sure what's happening. My GP looked me in the eye and asked if I had been using anything that would do this. I told him I haven't, which is true but I could see on his face that what I said meant nothing. I know I feel better not lying. that is the part that I enjoy most, no longer lying. If all my doctors spoke to each other it would have been harder for me. I needed my psychotherapists help and during that time I only could open up because he said everything was confidential."

I would also routinely push him away to see how he would respond. I wasn't doing these things intentionally. I'm a drug addict and he stayed through some really rough times. Now we rarely fight and are best friends still. He is on the spectrum and I think that played some sort of role in him staying but that is hard to explain. He is incredible really but I see nuance and the black and white thinking is rare. I started therapy 3 times a week after a suicide attempt 18 months ago and that has made our relationship stronger because I am getting better at being assertive and taking personal responsibility. He actually started therapy this year and it is helping him a lot too. One thing I actively work on is giving him space and time to himself and remembering that he has feelings too. When I am having an episode I have to actively remind myself that my behaviour affects his emotions. There is something in me that easily forgets that other people's emotions don't change so quickly and that he needs time to recover."
