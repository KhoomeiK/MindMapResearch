bipolar,erom4b0,t3_c2sd0f,1561082616.0,"I don't think I've never not been bipolar. I remember disassociation at a young age. And what I would call mild manic episodes. Hearing voices hyperactivity insomnia poor executive skills. It totally went downhill fast around 13. I spiralled out of control in and out of therapy drs all while trying different medications. I ended up in psychosis and hospitalized. It was rough. I began to level out at 23 when I committed to sobriety and staying on meds/ implementing all my therapy work into real life. I am now 30 and have a decent handle on triggers and can feel my episodes pretty strongly. 

I would like to be better but it takes time. And lots of hard work."

bipolar,erod3gp,t1_ern423k,1561075739.0,"I struggle with that feeling too. I honestly think it's what keeps most of us from STAYING on the meds. 

The calm is confusing and abnormal and the chaos is familiar and comforting. 

I often debate if it's normal, a side effect, med maybe isn't working or working too much etc."

bipolar_irl,ero8skl,t1_eri4t6v,1561071531.0,Can agree on the edibles. Def love vape pens. I switch between indica sativa and just not smoking depending on what is going on with my body at that moment.
