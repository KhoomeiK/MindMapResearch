selfharm,f82cpnh,t3_dyjjrq,1574188649.0,"I‚Äôm only a few years your senior and was in your place before. Telling your homeroom teacher is a good idea. You could ask her not to tell your parents, but depending on the laws in aus she might be legally obligated to tell them. This shouldn‚Äôt deter you from telling her though, because even if, like you say, they dismiss you, she will still be aware of it and I‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt, do you will still have her to talk to. Intelligent minds are often the sensitive ones, I am the same. Sensitivity is often a beautiful thing as compassion and empathy come with it, but it also means that emotions and feelings are experienced more strongly. The best thing to do is to find a positive outlet for those emotions, poetry, writing, songwriting, art, an instrument, or even maths or science, exercise of any form works amazing too.

Talk to her and do things like when she gets home from school ask her to rate her day and ask her what‚Äôs one good thing that happened today and if there was anything that annoyed her. If she‚Äôs spending a little while too long in her room ask her if she wants to spend some time with you and bake or watch a movie. Surprise her with cute things sometimes for when she comes home from school, like a bar of chocolate even. Have lunch dates with her once a week to spend some quality time together. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to open up to people you love. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to open up to people you don‚Äôt know. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to open up full stop. But make sure she knows she always has the option to. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be distracted from the issue than feeling pressured into talking about it and then getting worked up over it.

selfharm,f5x7js4,t3_dpjhts,1572536608.0,"I cannot express to you, how amazing this is. 

Poetically, this piece is beautiful and the techniques you have used have proven very effective.
I especially love the personification of anxiety, depression, pain etc. I think it makes a very striking juxtaposition; the feeling of perpetual loneliness against the feeling of being constantly surrounded by your ‚Äúdemons‚Äù as such.
I think the almost overuse of punctuation is brilliant. It gives the poem a very stop-start feeling which mirrors the content. 
You‚Äôve used the paint analogy, which is very frequently used, very well.
The underlying imagery of hell is really striking too. 

Emotionally, this piece is just as beautiful. 
I love the emphasis you put onto the trivial everyday acts that most people wouldn‚Äôt even consider. 
If someone who hadn‚Äôt shared an experience like yours, (like mine) were to have written this, it would have gone like; ‚ÄúI wake up. I sit up. I stand up...‚Äù whereas this poem describes these small acts as being much larger. 

This actually made me cry, though I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs more telling of my mental instability than your writing lol. 
Seriously though, I find poetry to be an amazing outlet. I‚Äôve also posted some of my poems here before (if you go onto my profile you could probably find them) which I find to be very cathartic, maybe for the fact that my vulnerabilities are being anonymously exposed. 
Keep writing, because you are really good. üíû"
