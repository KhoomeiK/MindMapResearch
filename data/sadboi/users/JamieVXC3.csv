BPD,fqqkld3,t3_gk59f8,1589567158.0,"Yes, 1000% yes. I wrote about it in this journal I keep and when I read it over I felt so embarrassed."
BPD,fq3cxgb,t3_ggg4pb,1589065205.0,I did this a lot in high school. One time it got super bad to the point where I’d walk away from them once I got what I wanted and ignored them every day after that.
BPD,fpgt042,t3_gdadnp,1588608969.0,"I did this with anime characters like Naruto, Inuyasha, etc. I also emulated Steven Universe a lot because I really love how bubbly he is and I wanted that in my life."
BPD,fozx3ov,t3_gadzsv,1588198416.0,"I hate how relatable this is, but I identify with all of these."
BPD,fnxcv92,t3_g416ts,1587336073.0,"I get the same responses when I try to warn someone, it makes me worried for them and makes me hate myself more. It makes me wish I could be that perfect person they see, but it also makes it hard for me to establish a proper identity. With every person I meet the way I talk and behave changes, because I don’t want them to see that I’m actually a fraud. 

But with the people that want to be around me for the long haul, I tell them the truth and warn them. They don’t listen :/"
BPD,fnm7bpu,t1_fnm3d2e,1587066351.0,"Yeah it does, which is why I usually write down what I feel and try to see if I’m going overboard or not"
BPD,fnlj6hr,t3_g2dt21,1587054458.0,I relate to this so hard and it hurts me every time I realize that the people I deemed nice/good are actually not. It’s like a constant surprise even though it should be obvious. It makes me hate myself more than I already do.
BPD,fmmxkz2,t1_fmmxj0f,1586214009.0,"No, never"
BPD,fmmt7kc,t1_fmmjtb1,1586211617.0,"Thanks, I’m glad I didn’t lose her as a friend either."
BPD,fmmt574,t1_fmmqgzr,1586211581.0,"Yeah I tried it, but the person I was seeing besides her and I also parted ways. I couldn’t handle staying in either relationship because I was spiraling and feeling abandoned"
BPD,fmm5xh5,t1_fmm5pxk,1586199383.0,"You’re welcome (: any time really. I’m sorry, sometimes intense situations like this virus shows peoples true colors. You will be okay in time and I was nervous about joining here too, but I’m glad I did."
BPD,fmm5lcb,t3_fw3mvf,1586199208.0,"It wasn’t your fault, that person was being a jerk. The virus is a serious thing yes, but it’s not okay to invalidate your feelings whatsoever. You’re right to feel concerned and express how you feel, I’m sorry you were spiraling and dealing with someone so mean."
mentalillness,fmkdg37,t1_fmkd50c,1586151349.0,Yeah that’s definitely the plan. Sometimes I want to give up on it all but I know it’s good to keep going.
BPD,fmkdcdi,t1_fmk6aeo,1586151260.0,That’s honestly a good idea. When we hold onto things too tightly we suffocate those around us. Finding a balance is super hard but it’s not impossible
BPD,fmjokho,t3_fviwwe,1586134521.0,"Being loyal is something I’ve always believed in, I was so obsessed with it that it got to the point where I was so picky when it came to my friends. It’s hard feeling like you’re putting in more than the people you’ve invited into your life. It makes having connections so hard for me."
mentalillness,fmi1ouf,t3_fvbw36,1586100499.0,"My heart goes out to you and you’re a true survivor. It’s not easy admitting to breaking down or feeling depressed, I have trouble admitting to myself most days. Roughly I can say I’ve had about 4 break downs in my entire life. I’m 23 and until three weeks ago I had never gone to a hospital or seen a therapist, I’ve also never been on any meds. 

I was powering through my depression, episodes all by myself. I had different “motivators”: rage, paranoia, nightmares, etc. I thought my family didn’t believe in mental illness growing up and felt too ashamed to say something was wrong with me. 

Anyways, 3 weeks ago I had landed myself in the mental health unit after having a really bad breakdown. I had tried to use alcohol and energy drinks to feel something, but it fueled my hellish brain into believing there was a pit that could erase me from existence in the middle of this mall and I had to jump from really high up for it to work. I keep reminding myself that the pit isn’t real, reminding myself to take my meds and reminding myself to journal all my thoughts no matter how weird or confusing."
mentalillness,fmi0mmr,t3_fvervs,1586099776.0,"Take a deep breath, whatever compelled her to make her distant from you isn’t your fault. We can’t control what people do to us, but we can control how we respond to it. I hope you feel less empty, I know what it’s like to lose someone after years of being with them. It gets better, it’s not the end."
BPD,fmi07ea,t3_fv7mvs,1586099454.0,"When I was eight I had a really bad episode, I remember feeling really hollow inside and then suddenly I was in the front seat of my uncle’s van. I was messing with the safety brake and it was going downhill fast. I stopped it in time but that feeling stayed with me for a really long time. On top of that my great grandmother often told me that I was unwanted several times, that my parents were both horrible and I would be the same."
BPD,fmciqpw,t3_fuaeix,1585946453.0,"I get that way too, it’s hard not to feel like you are the person you see on tv when they show traits that remind of things you hate about yourself. But you should talk to the people around you I feel, nine times out of ten you’re internalizing intense emotions and thoughts about yourself that others aren’t aware of at all. To them it’s just a movie, but to someone like you or me, it might as well be real life.

You have to remind yourself that that isn’t true (:"
