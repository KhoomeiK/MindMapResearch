AdvancedRunning,fqxzghz,t1_fqwkzd8,1589740181.0,"What you are saying makes sense..

The pace works out to be about marathon pace, or something that could be sustained for many miles, but was what he called a 3/4 effort.. A few notable runners/authors feel that marathon pace running builds â€˜high end aerobic capacityâ€™. i.e. Pete McGill 

I guess as I feel I am plateauing with easy running, I was thinking about adding something slightly tougher but keeping it enjoyable as not venturing into â€˜lactic acidosis land â€˜ which Lydiard felt was detrimental to building aerobic capacity.  If you look at the base period that Lydiard prescribed, there is a mix of easy running at different speeds , as he recommends some very easy runs, marathon pace runs , and a fartlek with short surges so as not to accumulate too much lactic acidosis ."
AdvancedRunning,fqxxqsb,t1_fqwdehy,1589739452.0,"Thanks.. I find I can run up to 35 mpw; I usually do 30 mpw..  This translates into about 6 hours of training and I run 6 days out of the week.  I do spend a lot of time warming up and cooling down, so that adds another 30 minutes per day, or about an 1 and a 1/2 hours total per day, which is a lot.. Using a run/walk strategy, I could easily run more as I am rarely sore.. I have it worked out to be 85 percent running and 15 percent walking. 

I basically run for enjoyment but I could see myself entering a few 5ks.. My unofficial time is about 24 minutes, and if I can get it down to 22 , I would be competitive in my age group 50-54.. I want to get my easy runs faster as I enjoy running faster and feeling effortless.. It would be nice if my easy pace were in the low 9 minute range. 
I have tried running slower than 10 minute miles and I feel like itâ€™s really a breakdown of good form. That is shuffling and almost having to â€˜restrictâ€™ how much I drive my legs toward. It feels awkward.  

Heart rate wise I am running at about 75 to 80 percent heart rate reserve - 136 to 143.. My lactate threshold according to my Garmin is 149, so I recognize itâ€™s a bit high, but it feels about right.. I would say a 4 to 4.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.. 

I have been run/walking in the 10 to 11 minute range for about 2 years with some strides, and 1 day a week of speed work- something short like repeat 200 meters or a few intervals for 2 minutes at 5 k pace.  I feel like I am plateauing in that my heart rate has not come down that much for these paces.. So I am thinking itâ€™s time to add continuous runs and treat these as â€˜ hard daysâ€™ .. Interesting side note, a small study was done comparing marathoners who had equal times but one ran continuously and one did run/walk.. Their cardiac enzymes were equally elevated showing that they had comparable cardiovascular stress, but the muscle enzymes ( CPK) were much higher in the continuous runner than the run/ walker showing that continuous running is indeed more stressful on the musculoskeletal system. 

Pardon the digression. I guess to simplify matters, if my goal is simply to run a faster easy run and keep it easy heart rate wise ( bellow anaerobic threshold) , then why not just run at that pace on alternate days and let oneâ€™s body adjust ? I mean if I am doing these â€˜hard continuous runs â€˜ on alternate days and am not getting injured, it seems the most direct way to accomplish my goal. I suppose an alternate way to tackle the issue is keep on run/walking for 80 percent of my runs and add 20 percent of hard intervals and get in better shape."

My wife is fairly vocal / feisty.., I try not to react as it just causes a loss of power and self respect. In the past when dealing with angry girlfriends, I would let them know when they calm down, I will talk to them.  With my wife, I guess I have slowly learned to put things on hold, and if necessary leave to go be in nature/ exercise as itâ€™s grounding.. I used to blame myself always for her dysfunctional behavior and assume my PTSD is the reason we are not getting along. She also bought into it as well, and to my dismay, it seemed like every argument got blamed on my PTSD, and not the actual objective reason for the argument. 

I have to confess , I found a small amount of ganja at night, helped me detach, be objective, and accept the disagreement... It helped a lot with derailing anger and promoting empathy i.e sheâ€™s overwhelmed, she didnâ€™t mean it etc. Meds help with reactivity as well.. 

But sounds like a super tough situation..  Key point is I wouldnâ€™t blame it all on your PTSD or yourself or your past.  An angry inquisition about a past relationship is not appropriate. Yelling is not appropriate. Itâ€™s abusive.., You might want to physically remove yourself so as to show him his behavior is not acceptable.  

Also, I even went to couples therapy with my wife for which I paid out of pocket. I was hoping the therapist would point out ways she was triggering me and tell her to stop - I.e. if we disagree with something she would always ask me if I had taken meds, even in front of my kids, despite how many times I told her not to do this. .

Couples therapy really made the whole dynamic worse as I was just hoping the therapist would tell her to cut that shit out. Instead, the focus was mostly on me and my PTSD

Anyway, a long story short, we quit therapy. I gave her a bunch of books like â€˜loving someone with ptsd â€˜ that I read , but she didnâ€™t. Despite this , things are slowly getting better as I have gotten better and regained the self - confidence that my perceptions are accurate, and she is just as responsible for the disagreement as I am.  ..

I know dissociation was my main defense mechanism when being traumatized by someone more powerful than myself.. In my family, my opinions and more importantly, the few times I spoke out about the abuse, I was basically dismissed, ignored, or worse ridiculed.. 

I think being detached from oneâ€™s body and feeling like you have no control over your body and are of no consequence are all very common in sex abuse survivors.. The feeling of being paralyzed brings back the memory of being raped as I literally was frozen and couldnâ€™t for the life of me say â€˜noâ€™, although I wanted to. It was stuck in my throat.. 

I think one way out of this â€˜floating head â€˜ is to engage in grounding activities.. that is doing something physical that connects oneâ€™s self to reality. Whether it be physical activity i.e running while being mindful of oneâ€™s breath or footsteps, or really listening to music , or smelling something pleasant like candles or soap , etc . Also , recognize that this â€˜floating feeling â€˜ is really anxiety and you can perhaps recognize that feeling with curiosity, not trying to fight it, but to just note it as a feeling or thought that is just passing through and doesnâ€™t define you. 

Sleeping is very difficult for me, as it is for most survivors, ( most common complaint among sex abuse survivors), perhaps as one stores a lot in the sub conscious or for me, the sexual abuse happened at night ..

AdvancedRunning,fmwrfbg,t3_fub3mn,1586451703.0,"I am 51 y.o. male. I ran briefly in college before getting a bad knee injury that took me out for 30 years! So I slowly had to rebuild about 3 years ago with run/walk and a lot of weights to correct the discrepancy in leg strength between my uninjured and injured leg.. I am currently running 30 to 35 mpw.. 

For over 50, the biggest thing I have noticed is it takes forever to warm up. I do a lot of dynamic warm ups, including lunge matrix, roll out my calves ( not well studied but some research shows foam rolling maybe more useful prior to running than after, based on improving running economy) and then walk for 5 minutes and then run/ walk the first mile before I feel loose.. My Garmin watch almost alway reports a negative number for â€˜performance conditionâ€™ for that first mile, which turns to zero or positive if I reset it after the first mile. I also take cooling down seriously and walk a quarter of a mile at the end, do static stretching, and drink a protein shake to prevent loss of muscle that older runners are more prone to that.. 

On top of that, another thing I am doing that I didnâ€™t do when I was younger, is a lot of fairly heavy squats, lunges, step ups, heel drops, monster walks and single leg deadlifts. From all I read, sarcopenia ( loss of muscle) and tendon elasticity - especially Achilles and decreasing range of motion are really the enemy for older runners. I also do short hill strides once a week. I only lift once a week for my lower body as I have read thatâ€™s enough to give you â€˜95 percent returnâ€™, as opposed to lifting 2 to 3 times a week.. I lift heavy weights as the research shows if you want to improve running economy, then you really need to train your neurological system to recruit more muscle fibers with each contraction- light weights donâ€™t accomplish this. The problem with lifting heavy is it takes a good two days to recover. 

I also take short walk breaks on my easy runs between miles - about 20 seconds but I have not noticed any decrement to my fitness. On the contrary, my vo2max per Garmin dropped 2 points when I was running continuously. I have switched back and forth between walk breaks and no breaks and this observation has been reduplicated. Again, I think a big limiter in the over 50 crowd is preserving the strength and elasticity of the musculoskeletal system; short walking break allows the muscles to recover and perform eccentric contractions necessary to keep the pounding down. 

So in sum, for over 50 itâ€™s a lot about prevention and recovery where there is a lot less of a margin for error in training. I have tried a few plans for 5ks- and what I do to allow me to do all this supplemental work is expand the 7 day cycle into a 9 day cycle, and basically go hard, easy, easier each three days.  But even with running just 30 mpw (easy pace is 10:30 with walk breaks), the amount of time I spend with all that much warm up/ warming down , plus a day of weightlifting, plus hill strides is about ten hours a week. Using the 9 day cycle helps me accomplish all this. I canâ€™t imagine putting in 50 a week time-wise. How do you accomplish all that?"

ptsd,fmszc3s,t3_fx5eve,1586364368.0,"Sounds like she is having intense fears of abandonment. I think this is common among people with complex ptsd, or st least it is with me. While triggered, or in an â€˜trauma related altered state of consciousnessâ€™ , I can â€˜turnâ€™ on my allies (wife) . Itâ€™s not that there isnâ€™t a reason to be upset; I just become super sensitive to any feeling of being manipulated, unheard, invalidated, stonewalled or gaslighted, even if itâ€™s unintentional, which it almost always is, as my wife loves me and is not that type of person. It used to cause me to overreact i.e. leave the house and say I am not coming back. When I snap out of it, I always feel mortified and am quite apologetic. However, my apology does obfuscate the underlying reason for being upset, which like I said is â€˜realâ€™, despite my inappropriate response. For example, I am being stonewalled when she leaves during an attempted discussion and blocks her phone. Itâ€™s unfortunate that we often never really get to the reason of why we were arguing in the first place, and my apology takes center stage. 

      So from my perspective, I try and practice empathy and see things from her perspective. That is she once told me - â€˜ when are you going to snap out of it? I am tired of hearing this, talk to someone else â€˜ when I tried to talk about my sexual abuse.  Pretty harsh statement, but to be fair, it came from a point of being overwhelmed, she had listened before, and was not her at her best. So I ended up finally letting it go; she is just as human as I am, and we all have our times when we are not are best, and yes it must be hard being with someone with severe ptsd. 

    I donâ€™t have any firm advice for you, but it does help when my wife reassures me or shows me how she still loves me, even if she doesnâ€™t do a great job expressing herself verbally. Arguments always have two sides to them, and the best I can do is to see how I am contributing to the problem, and take responsibility for my actions. Practicing grounding techniques help a lot to get me out of the traumatic state and enable me to be empathetic. I also confess , a small amount of ganja at night helps me be objective and self-examine the dayâ€™s events.  Itâ€™s been shown to help with activity in the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for decision making/ executive functioning; It snaps me out of what I call a limbic storm - the limbus being a more primal, central part of the brain responsible for emotions. Also having a good therapist to call you on your cognitive distortions helps. . But from your perspective, I guess try and see what the underlying issue really is I.e. abandonment, and reassurance that this is actually not going on, while validating her perspective. That is , ask yourself, if you can, in what ways might I be contributing to the disagreement, and make amends if need be. .. 

    Being in a relationship with someone with ptsd from interpersonal trauma is difficult. I guess all we can do is to try to examine and take responsibility for our actions in a mindful state... You might look into grounding techniques as I am guessing when she â€˜spins outâ€™ or goes into a â€˜limbic stormâ€™ , you most likely do as well, and that never goes well in arguments. Itâ€™s limbus to limbus instead of forebrain to forebrain, or heart to heart."

As far as an aerobic conditioning one hits a plateau after about 5 hours of running a week. So it seems counterproductive to run so slowly that your form breaks down and probably not contributing much to aerobic conditioning.

I tried two on meetup but they werenâ€™t all that active and never really met. It is somewhat alienating, but I have made due with groups on-line... A good one that is gender inclusive, world wide is â€˜survivortoughâ€™ on Twitter .. I also used to go on â€˜support groups â€˜ which has sub groups dedicated to survivors of violence, rape, sexual abuse etc. . For men, I have found â€˜male survivorâ€™ to be informative and helpful. The have a subgroup for significant others of survivors, similar to the one here, which is unique.. But itâ€™s been a fruitless search finding a group that allows guys in person. I mean, itâ€™s completely understandable if women want their own space to feel safe in, and I did, believe it or not, find that even myself had a tough time sharing my story with guys (much better now).., 

I have found that online, coed groups have taught me that this is an issue that doesnâ€™t really care what gender, religion, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation etc one is, and that itâ€™s an unfortunate part of the â€˜human conditionâ€™ .. In a way, itâ€™s nice to hear from people with different backgrounds having very similar issues and perceptions as it shows me I am not alone. Also, I feel grateful for the progress that the feminist movement has made over the past couple of decades in regards to advocacy for survivors and exposing deeply rooted paradigms of â€˜rape cultureâ€™..

I was thinking and from what I read, I am guessing that one might get the most benefit (and least risk) from 1 speed workout a week to just maintain/ improve neuromuscular systems, running economy, and intermediate/ fast twitch fibers, which people over age 50 start losing quickly.  I am thinking maybe one of the highest yield workouts for this goal is an â€˜unstructured â€˜ fartlek of 5k to 3k efforts with jogging rests, and to make sure to include some hills for strength..I like this type of workout as itâ€™s low stress and fun as can be done on roads and trails...  

The other workout I have been toying with is a slow tempo 20 to 30 minutes - meaning a RPE of 5.5 to 6, on scale of 1 to 10, 3 x 1 mile , 2 minute walking breaks to decrease musculoskeletal stress. I did these for about a month - 2 times a week, as not as stressful as 5k/3k surges.. I experienced pretty good results with a decrease of 9:30 per mile to 8:30 per mile over a month with heart rate dropping as well at the same perceived effort. I am still a beginner / intermediate runner and may favor â€˜slow temposâ€™ as easier and I think what I need to work on is basic speed endurance..

I enforce this by only allowing myself to buy 2 0.5 joints every 2 day, which I am stretching to 3 and then to 4..

    In the past, I found what works is to not be an extremist, as I naturally rebel against that mindset. Last night I smoked 0.25 grams and it didnâ€™t feel all that different than 0.5 grams, except less of a hangover in the morning. While smoking, it is hard for me to say, okay, â€˜enough is enough, you are having fun now , but more will not necessarily mean more funâ€™ .. 
   I guess a few rules I made for myself is no smoking before 7 pm, I am only allowed to smoke once, definitely just flower joints, and no more than 0.5 grams. I think what I will do next is stipulate that no more than 0.25 grams nightly. I am going to try and slow down when smoking as it does take 7 minutes for it to really hit your brain. Itâ€™s hard for me to smoke slowly as I donâ€™t want to be caught by my wife, so I guess I will just go to the park. I need to get rid of the attitude that one has to get really fucked up to enjoy oneself. Itâ€™s not all that fun melting into the couch and not wanting to do anything the next day. 
   I wish ganja was not considered â€˜essentialâ€™ in my state, as when I have gone to other parts of the country where itâ€™s illegal, only the first 2 days were rough( tired, slightly irritable, vivid dreams), then I pretty much was happy I quit. 
    But it is a stealthy bastard and I have to admit my reason for quitting may not be all that solid - I donâ€™t want to test positive in the future. Again my mind rebels against being told what to do by others.. The main side effect I donâ€™t like is feeling lethargic in the morning.

AdvancedRunning,fkrfis2,t3_fi3471,1584467847.0,"Actually your race times and data are very similar to mine... I am 51 and run a 25 minute 5k. I thought that was embarrassing slow as when I ran in college, my easy pace was 7:30 minute miles which is faster than my current 5k pace of 8 minute miles. But I felt better when I found out I am faster than 90 percent of 5k Runnerâ€™s in my age group.

I experienced the same frustration with trying to stick with zone 2..,Basically I would have to do a lot of walking and in my opinion, one canâ€™t really â€˜runâ€™ slower than 12 minute mile with proper form.  

I calculated lactate threshold of 149 hr, and 8:37 pace. Based on most recommendations, for easy running , I should stick bellow 134 ( 0.9 times lactate threshold)., Garmin has a decent program to test lactate threshold using a chest strap. But you do really need to figure out your maximum heart rate by actually running., It turns out, although, the formulas were accurate in my case-max 174. This took me about a year of periodic trial and error to hit this max.. 

But I am really questioning if training by heart rate is for older, amateur runners for 2 reasons. One is our heart rate reserve is a lot less than it used to be ( resting pulse is 50 for me , so thatâ€™s 174-50=124), and 2) we donâ€™t have a wide range of speeds to work with we did when we were younger. I mean if my mile time now is what my easy pace at age 19, then itâ€™s going to be really hard to fit in the whole spectrum of paces to heart rate without walking. I am thinking the heart rate training method is really for younger, faster runners., After all, I am sure thatâ€™s the population who we derived the numbers from. I donâ€™t think Jack Daniels was studying 50 year old, intermediate runners, intensely although I do see he does â€˜grade us â€˜ based on time. However, I am thinking he must be extrapolating from this population of runners who are just faster and have a heart rate max well over 200.. I did when I was 19 and my resting pulse then was in the 40â€™s.. 

I found the heart rate training method was a good prompt to slow down my easy runs but I use pace and perceived effort to ultimately gauge if I am running easy enough. 

I think one has to look at the population for which the heart rate data was based on, and perhaps say that the extrapolation for older, slower runners just isnâ€™t accurate... I mean if I am theoretically in the top 90 percent of my age group, I really shouldnâ€™t have to walk to fit into some zone.. What would someone who is 50 and in the 50 percentile do-crawl ?"

The only reason I think you would want to do one long â€˜double runâ€™ is if you are seeking to maximize fat burning efficiency and possibly train all muscle fiber types aerobically, as the longer you go, the more muscle fiber your body will recruit to get the job done. 

I read a good medical review on risk factors for injury. Pretty hard to get a consensus looking at multiple studies but one point I remember is risk of injury started to significantly increase on runs over 5 miles."
ptsd,fk4i4fr,t1_fk3sdwc,1583860906.0,"This was me and sometimes I canâ€™t seem to hold back about sharing. My psychiatrist said thatâ€™s actually very typical of ptsd. Sort of bleeding in public. For me, I kept so quiet for decades about the violence and sexual abuse that I want to break the chains of shame and speak out . I also felt like it wasnâ€™t real, and admit I told others for validation , which can be dangerous as often people will invalidate the experience as most of the society is in denial."
running,fk4hg0c,t3_fggs0k,1583860524.0,"I actually like dr Scholls and have tried custom orthotics as well as super feet and multiple others . What I have read is that itâ€™s hard to really â€˜fixâ€™ oneâ€™s gait or stance with orthotics as the body ends up compensating for how the orthotic is trying to change oneâ€™s gait.. 

I have a very high arch, but a hard orthotic that fits oneâ€™s arch may prevent it from really doing its job, that is like a spring, as it needs to compress and then rebound back to shape, if that makes sense. For all that I read, it seems like the best orthotic, and shoe for that matter is the one thatâ€™s most comfortable. Itâ€™s a bonus that they are less expensive than super feet. I think itâ€™s really all trial and error and pick the most comfortable option. ."

ptsd,fk2v58o,t1_fk2sxij,1583809921.0,"I had the same issue with my wife. I have ptsd from childhood violence and sexual abuse. I know what really sets me into a tail spin is when my wife basically stonewalls me or leaves. Yes, I do of course advocate being safe yourself, and setting limits but for me , itâ€™s an overwhelming fear of abandonment and feeling unheard that really gets to me. .. Actually , I think feeling unheard is the worst.  I know what would help me when I am really spun out is simple validation.. I.e. â€˜ you seem really upset , I would be upset too if ... Basically letting him know he is not alone in his feelings and that you are there for him and you love him. . The fact that when he snaps out of it and apologizes profusely is a good sign that his behavior during these moments isnâ€™t really him. It doesnâ€™t absolve him from having responsibility for his actions, but it is completely different from an abusive significant other who feels that you deserved such treatment. 

I mean, I had a lot of repressed memories jump out of me after an auto accident and partial blindness and I resent that my wifeâ€™s therapist told her to set firm boundaries when I really needed her. I have never been abusive, in fact I am dead set on never being like my perpetrator.. So it struck me cold as steel when my wife told me â€˜ to tell someone else , when are you going to get over this, Iâ€™ve heard this before â€˜ .. I think itâ€™s a very common refrain from the psychiatric community to preach boundary setting, but what is so bad about helping your S.O. when they need you. Yes, it will be tough, but isnâ€™t that a big part of love- being there.

Thatâ€™s my side of the story and obviously I donâ€™t know yours to any significant depth. But validation and letting him know you are still there while of course staying safe and taking care of yourself will go a long way. You might read â€˜ Loving Someone with PTSDâ€™ 
Anyway, pardon the somewhat tangential response."
ptsd,fk2tgl0,t3_fg682x,1583808768.0,"I felt very much relieved when I was finally given a diagnosis that made sense - PTSD- from all the things you mentioned. Prior to that, anxiety, depression, mood disorder, add were all in the cards but I guess a combination of traumatic events brought previous trauma back in the picture and things snapped into place. I was on cymbalata and adderall with still a lot of anxiety. Things got better when I really started to face those childhood demons , talked to peers in my shoes (mostly online) , did a lot of reading and my meds got expanded. A bit hard to accept at first being on more meds, but now I am a lot more stable and I just accept that having grown up with trauma, my brain just needs a little more help than those that did not have such trauma to stay on an even keel. I am fortunate to have a very experienced psychiatrist, and time off from work to heal. It does get better, so hang in there . For me, itâ€™s been about 4 years since the diagnosis of ptsd was made and slowly heading back to work ."
Petioles,fk1ac8q,t3_ffxj3h,1583775630.0,"Try two little joints. I just quit by cutting down gradually and discovered one can get a good buzz on just a little and not have a hangover. It seems like the effects plateau after a certain point and just contribute to a hangover the next day. Less than 0.5 grams a night , and pretty side effect free. But I am quitting for a while to see what itâ€™s like to be totally sober."
ptsd,fk12lzu,t3_ffw7j9,1583771166.0,"Cut yourself some slack. Iâ€™m white ( maybe â€˜off-white â€˜ being half southern- Italian :) ) , male, straight, highly educated , Ivy League and all that crap. Seemed to be impossible that I could be a survivor of sexual (rape) , violence and of course emotional abuse. I never wanted to see myself as a victim but talking to a lot of survivors, race, money, gender, orientation, occupation, religion etc ( you get the point ) doesnâ€™t give you immunity from trauma. Itâ€™s unfortunately a pervasive petulance that respects no boundaries. Anyone who thinks otherwise is doing you a great injustice."
ptsd,fjsbygu,t1_fjpz69t,1583595568.0,"For me, meds, and reading about it, and writing about it, and running all helped a lot. I did something similar to EMDR , brain spotting and it was helpful., I canâ€™t say I am cured and will probably take the meds for the rest of my life, but no significant side effects, so it could be worse."
ptsd,fjpby2w,t1_fjpaian,1583546885.0,"Yes. It doesnâ€™t seem to sink in.  I even got a book on â€˜loving someone with PTSDâ€™ which says â€˜donâ€™t blame all relationship difficulties on your partnerâ€™s PTSDâ€™ 
She refused to read it ( said it was too obvious- she was a psych major; I am a doctor - itâ€™s not obvious to me ) 

Anyway I read it, to try and see what itâ€™s like from her perspective . .. We went to couples counseling - my idea. Brought up gaslighting and stonewalling ( another habit of hers) a few times there as well. Again it didnâ€™t seem to sink in, and the counselor didnâ€™t really seem to elaborate on the dynamic going on., Very frustrating .. 
So today, I am feeling amorous and text her - perhaps we can be romantic tonight? I get a response that it is not going to happen as I didnâ€™t do enough chores.., So I fire back, â€˜ it hurts me to think that sex is seen as something you barter for chores, as if sex were a chore for you â€˜ 

I get told I am sounding like I havenâ€™t taken some med. ( that drives me nuts ) .. But yes, I go to my medicine cabinet and take said med and think , â€˜well crap, maybe sheâ€™s right â€˜ 

I think one gift of working through PTSD is it loans itself to fairly rigorous self - examination that would likely not happen if one were â€˜normalâ€™.. But I do think itâ€™s a common dynamic for the â€˜normal â€˜ partner to feel almost a sense of power that they are â€˜in touch with  reality â€˜ ( another phrase she uses ) and the one who is â€˜neurodivergent â€˜ is not .  

Wow , I guess I am angry at being disenfranchised to a degree , yet I do buy into it . I regret to some degree at showing my vulnerability.

I am not sure what to do, except smoke a blunt and try to get some distance and objectivity for the whole matter :)."
ptsd,fjoxg5k,t1_fjoqar9,1583536891.0,"My wife often seems to gaslight me (not intentionally) when we get into an argument that my problem likely has something to do with ptsd or forgetting to take my meds and very rarely that she has done something that anyone might find upsetting.. So , yes, it makes me doubt myself and wonder if I am just nuts or do I actually have a valid complaint."
DeadBedrooms,fjlrf5i,t1_fjl3u5o,1583452734.0,"Yes, I hate that . I get stonewalled all the time., I am not sure, but you might leave and say when you are ready to talk about things , Iâ€™ll come back but I am not going to take this . Frankly, I havenâ€™t taken this approach but I wish I had the courage to do so. I mean she is very stubborn and would just let me go. We even got counseling and the counselor told me she thought it was wrong ( in private session with me ) but wouldnâ€™t call her on it."
