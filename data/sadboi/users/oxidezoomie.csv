ptsd,eqs35li,t3_bzcrs2,1560275649.0,You don’t have to suck it up dude. Asking for help doesn’t make you less — it shows how strong you are.
ptsd,eqreibg,t3_bzbqg5,1560258696.0,"Yeah... I’ve been there. And it’s possible you aren’t connecting with the therapist and need a different one, but it takes time. It will get better. It just takes time. Hang in there. 

If it really doesn’t get better after a while you can try a different style of therapy, not talk therapy but like EMDR or something different?"

ptsd,eq9m086,t3_bxq2tv,1559911494.0,Check out Awakenings Treatment in Agoura CA they are fantastic and helped me a lot
ptsd,eq2ccjp,t3_bwwm5i,1559733791.0,EMDR is great. Neurofeedback has also helped with flashbacks. Ketamine infusions have helped with my severe depression.
ptsd,ept3tys,t3_bvx3ut,1559480761.0,Yep. (Sorry I need more coffee) but yes I’ve done this totally
ptsd,eppyd6f,t3_bvfzom,1559395078.0,I’ve taken it. It worked and cut out my nightmares. Unfortunately it also lowered my already low blood pressure and I had to stop it. But it worked so hopefully it will for you too.
ptsd,eppxhdf,t3_bvfdef,1559394421.0,Wow you wrote out how I feel. I’ve been getting a little better through intense therapy - I did a year of PHP that is every day. It helped a lot. I know that isn’t feasible for everyone though. I wish you luck on your journey.
politics,ep563ob,t1_ep4u75l,1559051093.0,Same on both counts
ptsd,ep51sw5,t3_btunnu,1559049288.0,"Yes. I recently went through a traumatic event that opened up these old wounds I had no idea were there, much as you described with intrusive thoughts and new flashbacks. I highly recommend therapy. You aren’t alone."
ptsd,ep1oj5t,t3_btor8q,1558992447.0,"I’m doing IFS now. It’s helping a lot. Just started a few months ago tho, along with ketamine for the last year and I’m doing much better."
AskReddit,eofazwe,t1_eof0k48,1558529212.0,I grew up in Scientology and they do that mind-over-illness stupidity as well
