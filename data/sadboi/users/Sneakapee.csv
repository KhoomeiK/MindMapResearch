I had a spider plant in a clay pot and it got so root bound that when I went to transfer him to a bigger pot, I had to smash the clay pot off of him because he ate all the soil and was all roots. The roots stuck to the clay pot. He’s in a bigger plastic pot now and very happy. 

Depending on the types of plants you have, they can need different care. Some of mine need less water than others. I have a player plant that can’t really be in the sun and so needs even less water."
childfree,fmeuqu3,t1_fmegi5n,1586013953.0,"You did read 60 + plants right. But in reality I probably have closer to 100 with indoor and outdoor plants combined. Inside I have just over 30 plants. Outside is over 60, and all those outdoor plant babes are all in containers because I am a renter and not a property owner (yet). 
My outdoor plants start needing a lot of water around April/May into October depending on our rainy season. The indoor plants I water about once a week. I’ve only lost one plant so far which is an orchid, the place I live in now doesn’t have as much humidity as my previous place so she didn’t have the right growing conditions to keep going. 
I have routinely mess up on watering my plant babes. They do sit dry more that damp.  I will notice if they suddenly aren’t feeling/looking as well and I will of course not ignore that once seen. The one thing I do constantly give all my plants is love. I tell them I love them. I pet them. I talk to them. If they are a flowering plant, there is a big celebration over their beautiful creation. I’m a person who believes in energy and positivity. Sometimes I think some of these plants are running on pure love as I have failed at watering many times. 

What kind of containers are your plants mostly in? I find that the terra cotta/clay pots will absorb some water out of the soil. So I find my plants in those pots get drier faster than the others in plastic pots. I have pots with holes in the bottom and trays under them. 
I will also move my plants around the house depending on where the sun is. My plants have “cooked” in certain places I’ve lived from too much intense sun. If your plants are drying up really fast it might be too sunny for them. Also any reflections off of glass being hit from the sun can be damaging if reflecting onto places. 

This was a long reply and I hope I helped you somehow."

You need to find your own happiness and live your own life. 
You clearly are going through some rough family times and Andrew is not being understanding or caring at all.  You don’t take away someone’s support when they are in their darkest hour. That’s not giving someone emotional independence. That’s just being selfish. That is Andrew: selfish. 
How much longer are you going to just give yourself away?
You deserve a loving, supportive, kind, and caring partner.  Please find enough love for yourself to find your way to happiness. Happiness is not hanging around while the boyfriend you support for years now suddenly wants to sleep with some other girl that’s around. Maybe he’ll get back together with you maybe he won’t? But why would you wait around trying to find out if that’s going to happen.? You don’t want to be with somebody like that because he’s just gonna find another girl to he wants to get with and break up with you again after you’ve paid all his rent and bills for him.

One thing I do to focus on myself is literally not being around people. When I broke out of my last big relationship, I lived alone and spent a lot of time alone (moved to new city where I had one good friend at the time). Spending time all by myself showed me that I can laugh with myself and have a good time. Figured out things that I enjoy doing (outdoor stuff, gardening, crafting). I enjoy spending time by myself so that part is easy for me. As I began letting people back into my life (making friends and hanging out with more people) and I realized that I need to put personal boundaries in place so I wasn’t beginning to be too giving again. I have a lot of love for myself and I began treating myself as well as I think I treat the ones I love. 
My mental wellness is at a point where I know I am the one in control of how I feel and what I do. I don’t have to do anything just because someone wants me to. I put myself first now because I’ve made so much progress with my self love and worth that I couldn’t possibly put another person before me. 
This took me many years to get to this point. I’m still single, living alone and very happy. Happiness is a choice. You have to decide if you are going to wake up happy or wake up being annoyed about something that happened in the past or something that you think is going to happen."
