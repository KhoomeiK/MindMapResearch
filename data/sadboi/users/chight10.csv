What you're getting with wrestling is a very highly choreographed show of pure athleticism, they have a timeline and story to tell in that short amount of time and be coordinated to physically throw each other around in a ring all while keeping tempo and pace for the viewer. Wrestling is an amalgamation of acting, athleticism, teamwork, and showmanship. 

That's only the in ring side of the business, after that there is the fictional characters that these actors must portray and carry out story beats even when they don't agree with them. They must also adhere to strict exercise regimens to keep themselves in top performing condition show after show. It's not easy at all.

UFC doesn't hit these same vibes and it's why most wrestling fans won't even compare them because they are not even trying to be the same thing to anyone who knows what it's about."

CDPR's games aren't perfect but they have improved the formula on every game they have made while keeping all their strong qualities of previous games in the mix. I honestly, think you played 15 minutes of each game because yeah the first and second witcher games start in the middle of events and play out, the third kind sets its own story up much better. I promise you no one plays those games for the game play but to call it bad is just wrong. Go play Outward to see some real janky shit. Otherwise I think you are just taking a contentious position just because the game is considered fantastic by most people and Cyberpunk will probably carry the same level of quality."
