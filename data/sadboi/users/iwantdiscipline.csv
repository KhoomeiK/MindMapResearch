 it boils down to is being responsible about exposure risks and not meeting up with someone unless you intend to keep seeing with that person. Social distancing in some form or another is going to last until they can get a vaccine out to the masses and it’s absurd to hide in my home until all exposure risks are gone. (And the curve is going down in my area.) It’s like STDs - abstinence is the only way to me 100% risk free, so if you fuck use protection, get yourself tested regularly, know who your partners sexual history, and avoid fucking so many people you couldn’t keep track of where you got your std from and who you gave it to."

As for others I do like a nice smile. It’s not a dealbreaker if they don’t show teeth. I don’t mind crooked or off yellow, just prefer people smell and taste good."
datingoverthirty,fr3d4in,t3_gmcqrg,1589854841.0," this sounds like my most recent relationship I left over a year ago. 

You are performing all of the emotional labor and he is taking you for granted. Why does he deserve you? What does he do to show you gratitude and make your life better? 

I was also with my ex for two years and I stuck with him despite being unsatisfied because I dated him for what his potential was, and not his reality. I felt guilty about breaking up with him knowing he deals with depression and anxiety but i ended up sacrificing my own mental health. He kept to himself and just gamed, watch twitch, write academic papers, and apply for post docs ... and drank. I didn’t find out he was an alcoholic until a year in because he is so uncommunicative and secretive he drank quietly by himself in the middle of the night.

he was so milquetoast that there was nothing particularly offensive about him other than his inability to reciprocate and communicate. I dated him thinking that I wasn’t in danger of fucking up my self esteem only to leave that relationship feeling undesirable and helpless. 

So long tangent short, yes. Leave him. You don’t need to wait until your partner is straight up awful to leave someone. You deserve someone who sparks joy and appreciates you."
datingoverthirty,fr3auxq,t3_gm6mi3,1589853470.0,"I am definitely anxious and I do date multiple people.

a. I am horny, b. I’m needy, and c. As you said about anxious people, I expect them to fail

I live in a city of workaholics. People are always out of town on work trips, visiting family, working their side hustle. I end up finding time to meet up with these guys like 1-2x a month and fuck it, I’m horny. Once a month sucks. Even with two people I end up only having sex 1-3x a month. 

Because I’m an anxious person, I need the positive affirmation and attention of someone in a serious relationship and obviously casual doesn’t get you that So I’m constantly searching for it like a bloodhound looking for truffles. 

last but not least, I have commitment issues. I don’t fear commitment in the sense I am looking for bigger fish or am half hearted in relationships. I am afraid of being in the wrong relationship and not being able to leave because I constantly overextend myself and try to make shit work while my partner is complacent. I fear complacency. I fear being taken advantage of. These fears are diminished if not nonexistent in casual relationships. 

Yes, I sound like a mess which is why I can’t be in a relationship right now. A “serious relationship” isn’t going to make me a better, happier, more fulfilled person. I’m too busy dealing with my own bullshit to form a partnership so hopefully I am spending my time taking care of my own needs so I can eventually have and maintain a healthy, committed relationship."

First dates are like job interviews - you hate them but you have to do them anyways so let’s put on our best self and show your date a good time regardless of outcome. If you treat dating like a chore it will become a chore. You’d be surprised how much your attitude influences the outcome of a date. I’ve had enough dates whose outcomes far exceeded expectations because someone whether me or my date decided they were going to have a good time regardless of what’s going on with the other person. Those are the fucking best dates."

Turns out it’s a facade and he throws temper tantrums screaming and breaking things when he’s upset. He thought everyone was terrible except like a small handful of people.

socialskills,fr03i10,t3_gllosj,1589782645.0,"The fact that you’re aware of it now in HS means you’re ahead of a lot of people. I felt like the two things that helped me the most with my social issues were therapy and forcing myself to put myself out there. 

A lot of social issues are tied with self confidence so seeing a therapist can help with that. My therapist helped me not feel like a freak or I was alone in my struggles. She helped me rationalize my anxieties and slowly undo self-sabotaging behaviors. I wouldn’t say I was suicidal but I could not envision my future because my social anxiety made social interactions incredibly painful. I just couldn’t envision living life like that for an additional month, nevermind 60 years. 

And for putting yourself out there - determine what are your worst fears and do everything you can to make yourself do it. You’ll end up doing it and failing so many times you get used to it and realizing it’s not so bad and eventually, you might even get good at it."

I go for a natural look for my makeup when I wear makeup because I never wanted to be one of those women who look weird or completely different barefaced. How often I wear makeup has changed throughout the years but generally I don’t wear it when staying at home or when I’m teaching.

A partner is ultimately there to be your number one cheerleader even when times are hard and to support each other’s goals and ambitions.

you essentially learn to communicate directly with people that matter again.

Right now 38-39 is the oldest I’ll go but I think the oldest I’ve dated within the past year is 34/35? I frankly don’t go for younger guys - I’ve tried, but it doesn’t work. 

 I feel that there is a maturity and experience gap between men in their 20s and me. The youngest person I’ve dated was a year older than me when he was 29 and I often felt like his mother. He didn’t have much to offer me in terms of intellectual know how, experiences, or even sex and affection. We had things in common but not more than a friend would have. I appreciated the pleasure of having someone to turn to for comfort but even that was inconsistent because he was emotionally immature at times and would rather make shitty jokes than communicate. 

I avoid men who are much older too because of a terrible first relationship with a man who was a decade older. There was a huge power imbalance that resulted in him being dismissive, patronizing, and taking my input for granted."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fqvyjt8,t3_gl6ek4,1589688146.0,"Eeeeh, I think it’s shitty for men to be cruel about women for wanting to be taken care of but at the same time I don’t think it’s men’s “roles” to financially take care of their female partner. It’s emasculating to shit on men for not being able to provide like their value is dependent on the size of their pocketbook. It’s as reductive as saying a woman’s only value is in her looks. 

Some men want to indulge their partners, some women want to be indulged, great. But if a guy doesn’t want to  financially support his partner it’s also okay - he just has to deal with the fact that he will be rejected by women who don’t accept that and he is not entitled to be indignant about it and feel entitled to a partner. 

I don’t mind going Dutch on a dinner, but in return I want a partner who is eager to please me in bed and pick up the slack in domestic shit I don’t want to do. It boils down to compromise and living up to the expectations you set out for your arrangement."

The two friends I have hooked up still are in my lives and supportive of me through breakups, dating, and relationships and I’m happy to play that role for them through their relationships. In fact, I feel they’re my closest confidants in many regards because they’re just overall less moralizing and judgmental about sex. Its only weird because other people make it weird.

Case in point I’ve been seeing the same guy since the end of October. I developed feelings for him when initially I was cool as a cucumber and have not been able to be forward and confident with him because I’m like fuck fuck fuck say / do the right thing. I’m self conscious about everything and it just ends up being me being indecisive, passive, and sheepish.

The most recent person I did not use condoms with was a fwb I had for 6 months and he showed me his test results and I was recently tested too. Assuming we didn’t have unprotected with anyone else, I didn’t mind since I also dislike condoms (it feels rubbery!) However he revealed to me recently he had a partner the whole time and wasn’t using protection with them, and it was upsetting because it didn’t matter if you had clean results and didn’t see anyone else other than the two of us, he took away my agency with that decision. I went to get tested after he told me (am clean) and I think this experience solidifies my choice to use condoms until I am in a serious relationship again.

I try to be optimistic and forward thinking with my goals and plans because I don’t want my disorders to define me.  I end up seeing these people who are amazing, kind, beautiful people but just tragic in their disposition whether it’s relationship or career based (sometimes both). it just sucks away my energy to be cheerleaders for two especially if your partner is a bottomless pit of depression. 

I just wish these guys could get the help and support they need rather than trying to shoulder it all or only open up to one person (their partner). People who care about depressed people share a part of the burden when the person cannot be helped.

I’m a single woman and about to turn 30, my only major debt is a car loan. I make enough to make a cozy existence for myself in dc but I have many opportunities I can pursue because I’m an intelligent and ambitious person and I’m kind of good at getting what I want (other than a boyfriend that doesn’t suck lol badumpsssh). I would love to move overseas or across the country for my career. Choosing my career over a relationship is a commitment to myself and my goals.

However I’ll take my singledom over the alternative situation any day, I own it. I have friends who are divorced and are in the process of divorce and I don’t envy them. I don’t envy the mommies on Facebook. 

Anyways, if you’re worthwhile you’ll find someone who admires that and wants to be with you regardless of your age. Many people don’t find their true loves until later in life and after multiple divorces. I’d rather not do the divorce thing and just wait."
dating,fqk3bwr,t3_gj8a29,1589419464.0,"Oh yeah. The spark is hard to get these days... turning 30 soon. I look forward to my 30s but the dating pool is shrinking since everyone is getting hitched (and subsequently divorced). 

I have a few insecurities wavering whether I’m being too picky or not picky enough, if I’m trying hard enough or not enough. My concern is throwing myself recklessly into a relationship and having my feelings hurt. I get over-invested even if it won’t work out because I really really really want that happy ever after for me. 

I have a love hate relationship with the apps. You can definitely meet decent, wonderful, compatible people on them. But it’s also a soul crushing meat market that allows people to be inconsiderate about dating and just fade and ghost left and right. Also it makes me overanalyze shit. I’m trying desperately to stop focusing on dating and love and just be content with my single ass which is hard. 

At the end of the day I am still looking for that spark and believe in it. I’ll rather wait and be single than just date someone who is safe."
dating,fqf4xwz,t3_gietg5,1589318796.0,"I’m in this situation but on the girls end. I’ve been talking to this guy almost everyday for weeks and we’re stupid similar but I don’t know what to think of it. 

First of all, most sane people are following quarantine and not breaking it for random people that might not work out. 

Second, talking online doesn’t automatically indicate in person compatibility. I wouldn’t ever commit to something that has been online only. 

and finally, it takes time to build the trust and courage to take the next step. My last breakup over a year ago made me hesitant to jump into relationships. I don’t have confidence in my decisions. I’m halfway between a nihilistic state where I don’t care about “relationships” and want to enjoy the moment, but also a bit of desire and hopefulness for new beginnings. I fear being taken for granted and being used, I can recognize that my behavior is a result of me trying to protect my own feelings. I want to feel so secure in my partner that I am finally willing to let down my guard."
dating,fqf1qpn,t3_giaic9,1589317260.0,"I’m not against others pursuing these options but I’m not interested in erelationships and long distance. I will accept long distance if it started as local but work / school sends a partner elsewhere. 

physical contact and being able to support each other in your everyday lives is incredibly important to me. I see myself as being very sexually frustrated and lonely without being able to have contact with my partner. I’ve been in situations where myself or a partner are separate for a month or two but that shit sucks. Cyber sex does not come close to replacing intimate, in person contact."
pics,fqanrnl,t3_ghq1n2,1589222195.0,"I am pro gun rights despite being far left because it’s the only means of self defense we have against a corrupt government. We not only see the government imposing on the black community in the US but a perfect example is what’s happening in HK where the citizens are defenseless against the government so it’s difficult to fight back. It goes back to the revolutionary war where the British government imposed themselves on American colonists. 

So even though I disagree with the people protesting against COVID, it is their right to carry a gun. Open carry during a protest is symbolic of Americans exercising their legal rights, not them wanting to shoot COVID or a governor if were being generous here. Protesting is an American right regardless of whether or not you agree with the reasoning."

Coronavirus,fq0xc6h,t3_ggfy24,1589038792.0," I would love it when people step away from the “thoughts and prayers” and other empty gestures and educate themselves on the political record and platform of those who are running and vote for the reform they speak of. But oh no, that’s too much work- they need to scroll through fb/ig the 20th time that day. 

I have good friends who love me and and tell me how much they respect what I do (teacher), but they don’t vote and it boggles my mind because my job is directly impacted by those who are in office. Betsy DeVos is actively dismantling public education. County/city council votes on our budget annual. State legislators also have education budgets. Your local and state legislators also have a lot of impact on healthcare policy. 

There’s no point of saying “______ should be paid more”, they’re “heroes” and reposting shit if you don’t put in the effort to vote on it. I might even go far to say you deserve to get shafted by “the system” if you don’t vote. I’d take a passionate conservative who exercises their right to vote than an apolitical person."

Gifted,fq0txb4,t3_ggblus,1589037593.0,"I don’t like the term as an educator. It promotes the idea that some people are “born smart” and they don’t have to put in the effort to do well which is false. What ends up happening is that your teen is liable to become lazy and arrogant because they’ve been told they’re “gifted” their whole life but burn and crash when they actually have to “work” hard for their grades in college or bust their asses in the workplace. 

Instead of praising kids for how smart they are, praise their work and effort. In education we promote a growth mindset (google carol dweck) which is the theory is that all individuals have the capacity to grow not only academically but as a person and helps kids be well adjusted in the academic and hopefully career world.  This goes hand in hand with the theory of “grit” where people learn how to handle failure and rejection gracefully and keep working on their goals until they succeed. When your kids don’t succeed or are reluctant to learn, don’t yell at them for being lazy, stupid, difficult - it’ll only cause them to avoid things they’re not instantly good at. Praise progress towards a goal. Help your kids develop long term goals that they have input in so they find enthusiasm in their work. Frame tasks that they don’t like in terms of how it will help them achieve said long term goal(s)."

AmItheAsshole,fpwrput,t1_fpvxtn4,1588968754.0,"I don’t think a parent is obligated to bail out their adult children but I also think “my way or the highway” with funds meant for your child is an asshole move. The way I see it is that money should be used for enriching, future oriented investment of the child’s choice which could be anything from education, to starting a brick and mortar business, seed money for his own company, etc. Sure these ventures can fail, but no one is guaranteed ROI on a college degree either. You already decided your son’s future for him so when he went off script you essentially all but disowned him. so ultimately, the money wasn’t even about his future, it’s about getting what you want. 

Long story short, it sounds like you only seem to be invested in your own happiness, not his. So that’s what makes YTA."
