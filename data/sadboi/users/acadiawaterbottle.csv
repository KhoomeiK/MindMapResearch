The person asked for 450 but I thought that's way too much if I say 200 they will probably say 300 but they didn't. I picked it up from this really nice house and it had no wear on it because it was on a guestroom so no one ever used the set. After I got it I looked it up online and the exact same set was been sold for 1200$ online."

It got to be so much it would make me cry after work sometimes. I was the highest paid employee after my managers because I would always say yes. I learned to say no and prioritize more important things. If they asked me to work more hours I would say sorry I cant i have too much school work. I really hope you are not working that hard for the same pay always ask for a raise if you dont get it I would quit. A good excuse if you are underage is to say my parents said I cant.

relationship_advice,fnkqn3l,t1_fni1e8v,1587037007.0,Oh ig the only way watching ecchi since childhood could have affected him is he might want his gf/wife to be the perfect seductress just like anime gf are in shows. But even that i doubt.
relationship_advice,fnkq6cb,t1_fni1e8v,1587036553.0,No he watches harems/ecchi for the comedy and drama. Anime  is very philosophy heavy entertainment some people interpret harems and ecchi as a type of art so he might like that part of it. He is not intentionally trying to fulfill a fantasy but it's getting fulfilled as a bonus. I dont think you should get him off ecchi but try to get him to watch other stuff not just ecchi. if all he watches is ecchi he will want more and it could lead him to bad hentai(like euphoria).  And no it didn't affect him if he grew up on ecchi or twist his views on woman because he definitely knows they're not real people and it's a fantasy. He probably shouldnt watch porn or hentai that could really fuck him up specially if he gets into the weird areas of hentai.
relationship_advice,fngs2nk,t1_fngm9ir,1586942855.0,"Harems are a man's dream a bunch of hot girls want you it's a fantasy 95% of men will never have. They are giving you all of their attention and affection. These girls are being represented as the perfect seductive personalities ex. the perfect shy girl, the tsundere, the smart girl. I wouldnt blame him too much specially if he didn't watch those types of anime when he was younger. You should watch or /rewatch steins gate dub with him its on funimation.This is a master piece the show will definitely get him off ecchi anime."
relationship_advice,fngly4s,t3_g1n6is,1586936571.0,You should try watching anime with him ask him to show you something you might like. Try to get him to do other stuff step by step little by little. If he is depressed he uses anime as his crutch.
