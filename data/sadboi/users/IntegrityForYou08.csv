relationship_advice,fnxe2sb,t3_fbm4cl,1587336747.0,"You are definitely not doing a single thing wrong!
He seems very apathetic and careless towards you and your problems. He seems quite selfish. 
It isn't your responsibility to get him to become more caring. You shouldn't be taking on his responsibility. If he isn't going to care about you, be there for you, or support you, then why should you be in a relationship with him? 
You can try telling him that you feel like he doesn't care about you. But to be honest, I think you'd be better off leaving him and finding someone else who is more caring, empathetic, relatable, and on the same wavelength as you. Your current boyfriend seems too selfish, sheltered, and childish to be a supportive partner for you in your relationship."
Advice,fnxcyyx,t3_g4g7qu,1587336133.0,"Your father is emotionally abusing you (and the rest of your family). He bullies you, and mocks and laughs at you when you stand up for yourself. You shouldn't feel bad for making your father cry. I know this may seem very hard to believe, but your father is just trying to trick you. When he cried, he wasn't crying out of genuine remorseful or sorrow. He is NOT sorry for how he made you feel. He was just pretending. He was manipulating you into believing that you hurt him to make you feel like your feelings don't matter and are less important than his. 
Read back your entire post. Your father is a bully. Any parent who bullies their own children is an emotionally abusive parent. They are evil people. It may be hard for you to believe, but the sooner you accept the reality that your father is a bully, the better you will feel. He is toxic, and does not care about how he makes you feel. Does your mother know about this? How does she react? If she is aware of how bad he treats you, she needs to be step in and help you. If she isn't doing anything to help, then she is enabling his bad behavior and is just as toxic as he is.
My advice would be to discuss this with maybe your friends or other family members you can trust. (but make sure your father doesnt find about your discussions). You're 16, and probably cannot move out, but I would suggest keeping a distance from your father and anyone who supports or defends him. Spend more time with people who make you feel happy, such as your friends or siblings. Limit your communication with your father and anyone who is like him. Try to avoid any confrontation with him, because he will only keep pretending to play the victim when you bring up his bad behavior. 
When you turn 18, I highly recommend moving out and seeking therapy. Your father undoubtedly has been abusive to you your whole life.

AskReddit,fmjtwx9,t3_froeu3,1586137663.0,"I saw your post from months ago, your post about your man child DH. Out of curiosity I went to your profile to see if you may have had any recent posts that show improvement in your situation. That's how I came across this thread here.
I've been suicidal so many times throughout my life. I feel for you and your situation, but I don't want to give you some fake happy go lucky lecture on why you shouldn't kill yourself. I'm not someone who has the answer to that obviously. Most people would see your thread and urge you not to kill yourself but only because they think they're being a good person, not because they actually empathize with you or your suicidal feelings. I can only tell you that life is awful, and that your desire to escape it is completely valid. Your feelings are completely valid. You don't deserve the bullshit that you're dealing with, especially the bullshit your DH gives you. You deserve unconditional love and acceptance. I hope your life turns around, and you find the life that you deserve. Your feelings are valid and you are valid as a person. 
If you don't feel valid as a person, or you feel that the external world, the drama with the COVID, the drama with your DH, etc., is too much of burden for you to deal with, well maybe you aren't putting enough value in your own internal experience (yourself). The drama of the apocalypse may not even bother you if you begin to prioritize your own intrinsic value. And step one to priotizing your own intrinsic value, is to unconditionally accept yourself, others, and the world as it is. Acceptance doesn't mean to put up with bs or to condone the bs that you don't like, it just means to come to terms with it and let go. Before you try to escape the bs around you, take time to value yourself and your own internal existence and feelings."

Guiding isn't synonymous with controlling. Additionally, if your daughter lacks empathy and a drive, I think it'd be best for you to help her improve characteristically. When she was called out for bullying in school, what did you do? Did you have talks with her to find out why she was bullying others, and did you work with her to improve so she'd no longer be a bully? She's 18 now, and I think that as parents, you and your husband should have worked with her ages ago to help her develop as a person in areas (areas more important than academically) where she needs improvement, including her lack of empathy for others, relationships, motivation, etc. I don't know what relationship you have with your daughter, obviously, but it seems like it's easy for parents to act like children are only trophies and nothing more than that. Rather than criticize your child's shortcomings and control her academic achievements and career paths, I think a parent-child relationship with a foundation in love and acceptance should be a priority between you and her."

His rapping seems so carefully regulated as opposed to other rappers who seem to just naturally let their lyrics run free from their mouth. It's almost like NF is carefully watching what he says. Of course, I could be wrong on his intentions, but that's just how it seems to me.
Question, do you genuinely think that if he wanted to curse he would do so? No he wouldn't. Being associated as a Christian rapper, and having a fanbase that is primarily Christian oriented, he definitely would not curse, even if he wanted to. I'm not jumping to conclusions, I'm being realistic. Do you really think it'd go well for any Christian rapper to curse? You know they would not. Regardless of whether the rapper wants to or not, they wouldn't. 
Also, I'm not saying he needs to simply curse for the hell of it, I'm saying he just overall shouldn't feel restricted to keeping his music PG, that includes the topics he raps about and how he raps about them. 
I'm not getting triggered either. You just want to say something insulting."

Have you even listened to enough rap outside of NF's music to understand it? Be honest. Just because someone curses doesn't mean they lack emotional control. Instead of jumping to conclusions about people you don't even know you should be open minded.
NF even says he has no problem with other rappers who do curse. He has collaborated with rappers who curse. Chance the rapper curses, yet he raps about God as well as his sins. Don't be so ignorant.
NF expresses his anger in his music. His music is his therapy. So for you to imply that rappers who don't curse have emotional control while rappers who do curse do not, makes no sense."
