Continuous Negative Network is totally out of control. 24 hours of pounding into viewers' heads we don't have enough tests, ventilator shortage, basically, CNN is screaming from the rooftops ""WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE"". Irresponsible reporting. They are worse than some of the commentators on Fox News.  I want unbiased healthy news coverage, This attempt at brain washing has been in effect ever since their beloved Hilary got slammed by Trump. News flash CNN Hillary was and will always be unelectable for President. As is Bernie Sanders.  So go back to the days of Benard Shaw CNN.
