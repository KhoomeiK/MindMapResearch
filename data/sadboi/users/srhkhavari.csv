You have het privilege as a bisexual and don't understand what bigotry is versus what homosexual women actually require for good boundaries and mental health. You are gaslighting homosexuals by giving them a list of ways that are okay for them to feel and not feel about who they should date lest they not be bigots or not virtuous. Your comment is bigoted, homophobic, and shaming of homosexuals for not accepting heterosexual sex."
Gender_Critical,fl5oqcp,t1_fl5nfgd,1584841874.0,"I'm not greatful to you for not banning me. Again, please do so I don't make the mistake of posting in your homophobic group."
Gender_Critical,fl5oe5m,t1_fl5nfgd,1584841632.0,Please ban me. I'm not interested in your watered down group or in a group that centers and prioritizes heterosexual women over lesbians.
GenderCritical,fl5ny0g,t1_fl5i2e2,1584841313.0,This group is actively homophobic and against seperatism as well as feminist class analysis and pushes the cotton ceiling on lesbians via bisexual women.
GenderCritical,fl5mm9b,t1_fl5i2e2,1584840385.0,Agreed. Be careful in this community though there are a lot of really bigoted homophobic individuals in this group who want to use biphobia as a shaming tactic to make lesbians think their sexuality and preferences are wrong.
truelesbians,fl5mh6m,t1_fl5lofm,1584840285.0,Thanks for your perspective. Feel free to dm me if you want to talk I'm on here for friends
truelesbians,fl5m092,t1_fl5i5ha,1584839955.0,Heteropatriarchy perpetuates misogyny and it's a trickle down system. It trickles down from straight relationships into gay ones.
truelesbians,fl5lqjf,t1_fl5kv6f,1584839767.0,"It is gaslighting because they are telling us we have a psychological problem or are bigoted/biphobic for refusing to date them. They are telling us we have to have a positive mental attitude toward heterosexual sex as well when we are homosexuals and repulsed by heterosexual sex as part of our sexual orientation. They are also claiming systemic oppression for not being able to access our bodies when they talk about ""discrimination"" in dating like it's a systemic issue."
