dating_advice,fj8cl7p,t3_fbwiea,1583110241.0,"i'm a male with anxiety & depression who got divorced about 6 months ago after a 13 year marriage. my mental health was part of the cause of our divorce. here are things i wish my ex had done that would have helped IMMENSELY to help save our marriage.
1) show support when episodes hit. don't place blame (which it sounds like you're not), but a simple touch and/or word of encouragement or support can go a long way.

2) be patient. it's not a linear process. she may have a string of several days when she's ok, then suddenly she's not engaged for the next several days. sometimes it's a random thing that triggers it. remember that it's not her fault or yours.

3) for me what can sometimes help is to start talking about whatever is causing the depression for a minute, then switch to a topic that interests both of you. this can help stop that mental downward spiral that is depression.

being supportive & patient is everything. don't expect her to understand what's going on. I usually don't know why i get depressed. and I've learned to give it time & work through it."
