The Coronavirus i a real thing and not a way for the antichrist to rise to power....I'm sure if there was an antichrist, he would already be in power. After all, drugs, money, and ignorant people is all you need for political and world power.

THe corona virus is a real threat. Just tell them your side, introduce the evidence, and finally the hard hitting blow that they would never introduce Millions of people into an inflammatory disease, that would cause pneumonia , just to introduce the antichrist.  Why not just rise to power in cold hard violence, or just kill them and install fear in all. After all, if it's the antichrist (If because I'm an atheist and this all sounds stupid to me.) Why would he go to power in an incredibly boring, time consuming politics/domination. Why? 

Hope i didn't come off as rude as i did in my mind.. But to those people you need to just tell them.  Hope this helps and pLease take any advice you to think about it."

But the fact that you can make people laugh is a win, Everyone is a joker now a days, It's hard to be a comedian because of that. I'm Also a fun guy to hang with ( As long as you enjoy Some offensive stuff.)  Listen the world will put you down with so many harsh things, But if you can make people laugh, you already won."

But to make my time go by faster, i Usually Make me do things. I put myself In a Situation that I Have to do it. For instance if there was a community event, I would make myself sign up for it so i would be able to do it. Or an activity for school. I would sing up, And then just do it. It sucks really, but it's the only thing that works for me. 

But to make yourself happier, I just. Hmm. Oh. I listen to the only thing that makes me happy, Music. It's My outlet. Find something that makes you happy. It's okay to think about Happy thoughts. It's okay to think your happy, just try not to see past the lie you made your self believe.

Advice,fhzj9f7,t1_fam74rb,1582001059.0,"Update: February 17,2020: Today I think I finally broke. Friday, Valentine's day is when it all started. I Was Given a Gift for Valentine's Day From This Girl I Never Talked to, Nor Have I ever had friends Associated with her, After A While, I realized It Was A Pity Gift. She Felt Sorry For me, So I Went Up to Her and Threw The Gift On The Floor. And Told her ""I don't Want Pity.""  She Realized I figured that out and she said nothing. 

After that, My Mind Just Stuck on that. And then, It all broke. My Mind It just didn't Want to coup With anything. SO I Started to plan Suicide. But Didn't know when. I Literally Wrote 5 different Suicide Notes because I kept Second Guessing myself.  And I was Also Caught by Someone while I was Writing as well,Instead of telling Her Straight Out ""I'mma Kill Myself"" I told her I was Writing another Song (Since she reads the songs i write before I perform with my band). She believed it and walked away. 

Then, Lunch. This Is where Shit does hit the fan. I, For no Reason At All, Took My phone Out of my backpack, And Threw it as hard as I Can on the Ground. It shattered into Many pieces, The Battery was Almost In two.  Then I proceeded to Jump And Stomp on it. While I Silently screamed. My Jam Was Opened As If I Was Screaming. And My face was as Angry, confused, and scared As I am Now, Writing this. I Made A Scene, And Made Everyone think I was Insane, and For a moment I really felt as if it was. (For you, Breaking A Phone Means Not much. I May Seem Petty for it. But Music Is really the Only thing that keeps me Happy. It really is. I Broke the only thing That'll give me Happiness, I Really need music to be happy. I'm not joking. ) 

After that, Word spread fast around the school, that ""Something is not right with Carson."" In Class it got even worse. I hate People. I don't like interacting face to face.  And Yet my spanish Teacher Forces me to work with My ""Shoulder Partner"" Of Which I know doesn't want to be around me. They all felt sorry for me though. I could Feel it. That was the rest of the day for me. Only thing that's notable Was A Secret Admirer Note in my locker that was dated back to last month.  Before all this pity. But For some reason I can't Remember, I tore it up. I Regret that severely. 

Today though, the pity didn't Go away. And I Got another Note In my locker. From The Secret admirer. Asking for a response from the First note. I explained everything to her/him (Although I'm not gay, I really don't care who wrote me this. Besides if it was a boy we could just be friends.)And Left it where it told me to leave it. Who it is, i don't know. I don't want to know either. Then My Drummer for my band got real pissed at me just because I told Her I don't want this drama. (She got Ghosted by her boyfriend whom i'm friends with. She Got Mad Because She wanted Me to tell him why she's breaking up with him) She gave me a whole note and everything to tell him. I ripped up the note in front of her. This caused me to write a poem/ story ( I don't write poems at all)  Called ""Not everybody Gets It"" It's About Love, and how some are able to find it, but try to forget about it once it's over. And How Some can't find it. The Rest of the day was all the same. Boring Repetition, and thinking about how to end it. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes i find myself laughing at disturbing things. My math teacher told us That his wife's Friend Daughter commited suicide. And I laughed. Really Loud. I got  sent out because of the interruption. And He told that it wasn't funny outside.  I later laughed at one of my friends misfortune. Her boyfriend was going away for 17 months. I couldn't stop laughing.

I know this isn't Really asking for advice, But I just wanted to give an update on my state of mind. And ask would A Normal person Do this as well? 

I mean Valentine's day is tuff on anyone who's single.But I'm not only single, I have severe depression, and Suicidal as well, My mind was all Messed up. I couldn't focus, And I could hardly Breathe so many times. And When I did have that ""Episode"" I Was holding back a lot of things. I was afraid what i would do to others. To people i think should die. To people who do nothing but judge others as if they're perfect. I hate those people the most. 

I'll be posting more about this in....Somewhere. I don't know.

Is this normal? Or Am I just. 

I don't even know."

I did start up taking not only boxing but also a detective thing....Um People from my school come up and ask me for some things that they could use advice on Or they need help investigating a person who they think is in possession of a Jul or anything of or relating to that. Since My town is riddled with druggies and the less fortunate, it's very easy for people to go towards that stuff. Hell Yesterday I did see a kid with a cigarette, and there mom was right on the porch watching them. It's terrible over here. So far I actually got a lot of students in trouble because of my investigations. Some found out about what I was doing and tried to start a fight with me, since they're all the kind of person to say, ""Come on, fight me you pussy. What you too scared to fight me? Come on hit me free hit!"" even though they are the ones who want to fight. I just sit there, waiting for them to do something, But they never do. There all Cowards.
