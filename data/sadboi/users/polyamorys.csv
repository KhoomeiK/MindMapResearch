i feel like regardless, no matter how “willingly” she starts out agreeing to this, it’s going to lead to her wondering how you can get off with her being so disinterested. i understand that “cumming bareback in a vagina” feels amazing or whatnot, but i think her mental health and encouraging her to seek help and get better, along with supporting her treatment and the steps she is taking to get better, is more healthy - and more important - long term than getting your dick wet right now. like, i wouldn’t want to have sex with my boyfriend if he didn’t seem into it. that just feels like i’m being selfish, or taking advantage of him. so i can understand why you would be concerned that she’ll eventually feel that way towards you, because i would expect someone to feel that way towards me if i did that to them."
