SelfHarmScars,f0ugfkk,t1_f0txbz0,1568940095.0,"I was clean for a while but it's getting pretty hard again lately, and I'm on the verge of relapsing.   
I never got to ask openly for help. My personality was the biggest barrier that held me back from screaming for it. I cut it in my hand, wrote it on my band-aids and so on, hoping that people would pay attention and take it seriously. They didn't, lol.  
Whatever though, days go on and I'm alive, gotta bear with it."
depression,f0tqljj,t3_d6dxpl,1568927112.0,"Depression fucked me up at 21. It cut, bit, burnt, strangled and tried to kill me. It changed me so bad that I forgot who I was.  
It took what I thought was the only real thing that I can love in this world.  
I'm doing relatively fine for a while, but I know that it's near impossible to open up that deep to someone and get accepted despite all my dark clouds and nightmares.   
Makes me feel like I'm a living dead with a heart of stone, cracking from the inside and breaking my bones."
SelfHarmScars,f0tpint,t3_d68p6u,1568926542.0,"\*Why\* reminds me of my nights of silently crying and screaming into my pillow, asking why. Also had ""Help"" and ""Lost"" cut in my hands. Glad to hear that you're doing okay!"
