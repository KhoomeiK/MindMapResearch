ptsd,fkw00n6,t1_fkubsxb,1584580394.0,"This made me laugh out loud because this is something I would do. We drive the same trip every other weekend and have been for years and I couldn’t tell you how to get there or back. I really think people think I’m dumb and I used to be seen as “bright”... it’s hard but I embrace it, gotta have a sense of humor about it."
muacirclejerk,fd095zf,t1_fczfv51,1578115491.0,Lol me too but it couldn’t have because my husband is trans and I don’t take prenatals so I guess they just felt like it omg
muacirclejerk,fcy9y23,t1_fcvbrud,1578076858.0,"Hey pharmacist, I have a question! I’ve been on the mirtazapine (as well as other meds for ptsd) for a while now. I’ve gained quite a bit of weight. Last time I went to the pharmacy for the mirtazapine they said it was “held” because they needed to ask me if I was pregnant. Is this normal?"

muacjdiscussion,fbhd1vi,t1_fbguj37,1576870792.0,I bought the shape tape foundation because I didn’t realize everyone was talking about the concealer and I’ve never hated myself for spending $40 more in my life
venmo,fbhbt6g,t1_fbgklkw,1576869955.0,Why was it in your Venmo? I thought you were transferring from your bank to your friends?

venmo,fbg4sby,t3_eczh18,1576834398.0,You all have to email in with your photo ID and verify account info and wait for an account specialist to reach back out to each one of you. Regular customer service can’t do anything because you have been flagged
venmo,fbg4r27,t3_eczh18,1576834343.0,"If the money is in your bank and you paid people via Venmo and they aren’t getting it, that’s because the problem is on their end. You are not responsible. If the money was taken from you, and it’s in their account, they have to do the work to verify themselves and get removed from the blacklist. They aren’t keeping it, they are holding it until it’s verified by each individual this isn’t a scam."
venmo,fbg4o3d,t3_eczh18,1576834221.0,"It’s curious that you would choose to get the money from a go fund me to your bank, and then somehow get it in Venmo. You can’t transfer money into Venmo like that?"

Ian, c’mon?”) and how to keep his job and also be the moral medium for everyone"
offmychest,fax24vo,t3_e1td0a,1576377856.0,"Also, low self worth is why we tend to get re violated. Shitty predators see that in us and use it to their advantage. It gets worse when you mix in drugs because all the sudden your body seems like a fair bargaining chip, considering it’s never been worth much anyway. None of that’s actually true but that’s how it happens."
offmychest,fawzuwy,t3_e1td0a,1576377190.0,"I just want to tell you that just because you don’t have nightmares currently or show the signs we like to think of as PTSD, doesn’t mean you don’t have it. The drugs, the drinking, the suicide attempts, that’s all huge indicators of PTSD. I think how you feel is how I felt at your age, and that was the absence of emotion about it. That absence can disappear after you become stable and find a support system. I always chalked this up to being in survival mode so long that you’ve learned to actively ignore any emotion processing. I feel like I’m talking to myself as a young adult. Please be as safe as possible. It’s okay to move away if you need to after you can and you don’t have to visit your mom or anyone. I didn’t know I had ptsd until I was 25 and all that happened to me too. If you need someone to talk to please reach out!"

mentalillness,eqxdkii,t3_bzu6uw,1560367964.0,"I think that for some it is about pushing through the harder times, but for others pushing through isn’t possible. That’s the whole problem. That our brains make it very hard for us to get out of bed. The solution to not being able to shower and leave the house is not shower and leave the house. You need a support system and someone who’s willing to come over and just help you. Maybe just be some company while you feel that way. I was really bad over the winter and my husband was the best about it."
mentalillness,equ8cqy,t1_eqtf495,1560326106.0,Write it down like the suggestion and give it to them. It’s easier to say scary things that way. You need help before anything bad happens and you have all that guilt.
acne,eq3eq8x,t1_eq1fcl6,1559754503.0,Yeah so I definitely went out in the sun and my face is splotchy now because I was wearing it. How would I both use the moisturizer and BP? I’m just worried the moisture kind of cancels the BP effects.
