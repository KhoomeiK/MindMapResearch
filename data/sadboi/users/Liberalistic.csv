Domestic violence is not something that only happens to females by males. The signs don’t have a gender either. Both men and women are susceptible and as a feminist myself I am 100% in favor for non gendered domestic violence legislation. 

Equality means men and woman are in equal planes. Not that we tear men down and diminish their experiences. Whoever is spitting that is a misandrist not a feminist."

He’s probably really stressed out about what’s going on with his hours cut. Maybe refusing to process what’s going on. 

Tell him it’s ok to think what he thinks but constantly ranting about conspiracies to an unwitting audiences is NOT ok."

Anxiety,fp258gd,t1_fp0bwh5,1588255396.0,Yes!!! Assuming you’re an adult you are paying for their professionalism. Being open and honest is the ONLY way to get the most appropriate treatment for you.
Anxiety,fp0qzoc,t1_fp0lk0l,1588214996.0,"YES!!! I went to one of the biggest gastroenterologist clinics in my big-ish city and there’s a lot of research that suggests there’s link between the two. 

They were not surprised I had anxiety that lead to abdominal pain and digestive issues. I asked how often this was the case is his practice and he said about half the time.

I was prescribed ajustes medication specifically to treat my stomach issues as a teenager."
Anxiety,fozrr39,t1_fozoqof,1588195717.0,You should never be ashamed of who you are :) I completely respect that too.
Anxiety,fozg3rd,t1_fozfop2,1588190074.0,"May I ask what the condition is? It’s totally unprofessional for any therapist to treat you differently because of your conditions. 

Medication is a lot of help but talking to someone who can help you understand yourself more is so worth it."
Anxiety,foyyex6,t1_foyt9bt,1588181490.0,The sinking feeling in the stomach that radiates is totally me. I know exactly what you’re talking about. It’s the worst. Makes it hard to concentrate cause you’re constantly in pain.
Anxiety,foyy3pr,t1_foyfhpc,1588181327.0,"Have you considered going to a psychiatrist and getting on medication? Anxiety is 100% an physical reaction in your body’s fight or flight mechanism. 

My anxiety disorder had completely ruined my digestive system. I know that feeling you’re taking about. Like someone pinched your gut. 

Medication and therapy has made a world of a difference. I usually wake up in a panic as well. First thing I do is take my anxiety meds then just cry it out then psych myself up for the day. 

You can get through this ✊🏽"

funny,fgf46p8,t1_fgenuso,1580723474.0,Same here! Also about a decade ago. She’s a great vocalist. I mean she actually sings so that’s already ahead of most pop artists. And she doesn’t need a giant production to put on a show. The woman commands attention.
fashionporn,fg5xmvh,t1_ff53wr3,1580543310.0,I wouldn’t have minded the silhouette of it was a bodycon-style jumpsuit. The short skirt definitely ruins the flow.
fashionporn,fg5xjp4,t1_ffcirex,1580543192.0,Nope that collection was actually inspired by microscopic sea creatures. Weird I know. There’s a finial rn fíen to that but in blue/ cool shades. The red one was much better in my opinion though.
fashionporn,fg5xg7q,t1_ffc7wy6,1580543062.0,"I’m a fan of what she’s doing with layering and draping many, many individual cuts to create a “manmade” 3D type of experience. The way the fabric mowed in the finally piece was absolutely sublime. I’d love to se her explore that further."
dankchristianmemes,fe6pdjw,t1_fe6o9vg,1578899246.0,I appreciate that! English isn’t my first language 😅
dankchristianmemes,fe6milx,t1_fe6fwjc,1578895982.0,Fellow atheist! It’s okay to waver. I oftentimes wish I could believe I could go to a heaven with my grandma.
nextfuckinglevel,eu1e7za,t1_etzsar8,1563365499.0,I agree in theory. The only thing is that’s a bit hard automate without everyone just doing the same routine but better over and over.
iamhavingastroke,et7y289,t1_et7um0a,1562541210.0,....no
nextfuckinglevel,eru2m4h,t1_ersohrk,1561260984.0,"I think that ice skating as a sport values grace more than athleticism, which is a shame. She’s an athletes; she should not be penalizing for pushing the bar on what can be done on the ice."
