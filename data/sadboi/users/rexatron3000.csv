Was literally coming say exactly that, the ridiculous thing is they actually said both these things in the same bulleted segment, completely contradicting themselves. would really like to know what an experienced lawyer or judge would make of this supposed legally binding waiver when there are things like that on there.

I have watched someone take part in this on YT, can't remember what channel it was, but basically they got stripped down, tied up, gagged, waterboarded etc. etc. and gave up, but when they came out they were not in a good way, took them an hour or so to recover from the more extreme physical and mental reactions, which is to be expected, but I really wouldn't be surprised if someone did get seriously hurt as the intent is to scare and effectively torture them into submission and subsequently make them quit. Also the guy that runs this definitely enjoys doing it, but in a way that you know he has very obvious sadistic tendencies.

I don't see how any kind of ""legally binding"" waiver can actually allow someone to basically commit assault, general bodily harm, battery, intimidation and probably numerous other crimes. When these nutters agree to be eaten by cannibals it's not as if the cannibal can turn around and go, ""well look at this waiver I got them to sign"", I know that's next level, but the crimes committed here are serious and you can get lengthy prison sentences for them, it just seems ridiculous for anyone to think that this is legal and/or acceptable."

The character development in this show really is next level, and to be able to view the characters' at different stages of their lives, portrayed and acted by a separate actor in each time period, it's really extraordinary how none of what they have shown feels out of place, the nuances of each character are extremely well portrayed by all the actors (massively impressive performances throughout by the cast - young and old). 

While the development of the characters works so well, the relationships and character actions/reactions feel extremely natural and organic even though some characters are played by up to 3 separate actors, it is supremely impressive and I still have nothing bad to say about this series, I can only wait in great anticipation for S3, which is supposed to be the last (I heard it was a finished work of 3 seasons and that has been the intention throughout, which is beneficial), but to wrap up all the questions, topics, plots and all the other questions these will no doubt provoke I think they might have to double up the amount of episodes or something, unless it's one of those series that leaves the ending up for a lot of personal interpretation. 

It certainly has similarities to Lost, but where that programme kept getting renewed and the writers were making more plot up as they went along, Dark is prewritten and includes no filler, I can't think of any parts yet that I thought were useless filler for the sake of minutes, there's zero fat on this series. And instead of getting a bullshit ending that had been denied multiple times, repeatedly, like Lost who went with the bullshit cookie cutter ending that had been predicted by a minimum 50% of viewers, we're going to get an ending that will no doubt be mind blowing, but that the creators had already written before any fans had seen the first series, before any feedback or expectation, with no worries about getting cancelled or renewed over and over, and it will be that much better for it.

One more time I will urge anyone who likes to watch well produced, written, casted and directed series that provokes questions and makes the viewer think, this is something you shouldn't miss out on, and if you want the best experience then please watch with subs. This is around on par with Breaking Bad for my favourite series of all time and I've seen a lot.

You can just pour the K/water mix onto a high sided plate, place another on top and whack in the microwave for a few minutes (be careful with different microwaves though as some are WAY overpowered compared to others), basically you want the water to have fully evaporated with lots of reformed crystal all over the bottom plate and a decent amount on the top also.

I actually think the way I've used drugs most inappropriately is that I often use stupid amounts of them, I love taking combos, especially ones that I know I really shouldn't, and crazy cocktails (although I'm not so keen on that anymore for something I'll mention in a sec), and crazy amounts of what would definitely have killed me when I was balling - probably should have died a few times over from both the doses of the boy and the girl, but the dose of the other saved me, I had no care in the world about my life at this point though. 

I have suffered several drug induced seizures (fortunately people were there to help most times) and I've also gone through drug induced psychosis (from the cocktails of usually MDMA/2CB or LSD/Mephedrone/Ketamine/Weed) which I can say without a doubt is the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me both times over, I put it down to the mephedrone and the weed as everything else I had done together with no issues but after using the mkat all night, when it would come time in the morning when we got back and people were lighting up a couple of tokes and it would set me off instantly. Wandering out of my mate's house and down the high street on a BUSY Sunday morning with lots of families and old people and hearing everyone I walked past saying the most awful stuff about me, feeling like I couldn't trust my friends, or even myself, because the K was sort of erasing little periods of time as well so I would worry that I'd just done something super weird, but those voices, I'll never forget them, and I applaud and admire anyone who is able to live with psychosis regularly.

Anyways, went a bit off topic there, sorry about that I'm in a rambling sort of mood atm! Don't think you needed my life story, I got suspended from my group therapy recently because I relapsed so now I just end up going on and on about nothing! Apologies for that, peace!"
ketamine,f4jtpl4,t1_f4jnouf,1571626121.0,"Can't say I've ever used a micron filter, I know it would be better, but I've always got on fine without it, the stuff I get is always good shards, dissolve like a dream, when I say the meat part of the butt, normally I'll hit the top right or top left of the cheek, so near to the hip, (always gotta check you ain't hitting veins/arteries/nerves either) I've never had any problems with IM \*touch wood\*, always keeping everything sterile and checking after to make sure everything is in good condition. I feel much safer doing IM, defo hit a nerve or artery once when IVing - that wasn't fun, felt like I got electrocuted all the way up my arm."
ketamine,f4jlazh,t1_f4ftdmo,1571621629.0,"Simple as. If you want to hole get some top quality shards mix it with sterilised water ready for IM injection. a little heat to get it all fully dissolved and you're good to go (a 10 year old could do this it's so easy)! The meaty part of your butt is a prime location, get that all in quick, get the needle out and lay the fuck down coz you are gonna have one of the best holes you ever have! The first time I IM'd I pretty much swore off of insufflation unless I'm taking bumps at a party, but I don't use regularly any more for obvious reasons i.e. I like having a functioning bladder."
SuicideWatch,f4jjyzs,t1_f4gq4mb,1571620944.0,"I was kind of aiming for that when I was in my early 20s tbh, stupid as that is, but I've always been suicidal for a lot of different reasons, mostly due to my own mentality, constant drug abuse and personality disorder, but I'm 30 now and will hit 31 in Jan next year (hopefully). I've been feeling really suicidal again lately, if I didn't have such a supportive family there's no doubt I wouldn't be here now, but I do believe it's possible to change your mentality, your behaviours and thought processes, of course it's hard work, but I just try to imagine what it would be like to live a satisfactory and happy life even for just 3 or 4 days of the week EVERY week and maybe it is worth all that hard work because living in a constant downward spiral and daily struggle just becomes too much for a lot of us.

I can't and don't wish to judge anyone else but I hope you find a reason to make it past 30, and to find well earned happiness and satisfaction, because everyone deserves that, especially when you've been through the mental hardships of suicide thoughts/plans/attempts. Unfortunately these last 3 years have been the hardest of my life but I have also accomplished some of the things that I am most proud of in life and made a lot of progress, I honestly hope you can change you mind and maybe start a new club a bit further down the road or something (hah jk jk) good luck to you buddy, stay strong."
SuicideWatch,f4jhmqr,t3_dkfkaq,1571619710.0,"I feel exactly like this, I feel like unless something really drastic happens to change my thoughts and behaviours, my relationships and my view on the world, I will end up committing suicide at some point, I've tried twice a few years back through overdose of multiple drugs but at the time my tolerance was so high and I underestimated how much I really needed to take to do the job, so I just passed out face down for about 24 hours and woke up feeling pretty shitty and stupid. I've always taken drugs as a coping mechanism so my tolerance for a lot of substances is constantly very high - anyway hopefully the group CBT therapy I'm involved in will help in some way but unfortunately I'm having a bit of a downward spiral at the moment, anyway, I'll get back to my main point...

What I really came here to say was that Hunter S. Thompson allegedly told a friend, years before he finally went through with it, that he always kept a loaded gun in his drawer because it gave him some feeling of safety and control that he could end his life whenever he felt he needed to or wanted to, so he obviously had similar feelings about suicide that a lot of us here do. 

I just can't imagine growing past 80 with health problems, going in and out of hospital, being a burden on others, watching all your friends and family die, and no doubt watching the world's problems growing exponentially worse. I hope for everyone who feels like this that you can find a real purpose and joy to live, but I essentially view religion as a safety net for a lot of people, I guess for us it's just the control over our own life/death, rather than clinging to the hope of an afterlife. 

Anyway, stay strong and look for the positive, or at least a silver lining, I feel like a bit of a fraud saying this but I really mean it, I just find it hard to take my own advice. Peace and much love!"
Methadone,f3fywuj,t3_dgw9wp,1570904963.0,"I think on a high dose of methadone (100mg+ daily) you are covered off for use on top almost as well as you are when taking subs, because you just won't get high, it will piss you off and you will stop trying, the harder part is staying clean when you are at a lower dose of methadone, say 50ml a day or less, because then the blocking effect is far less apparent and you can still use on top so switching to some form of bupe (Suboxone or Subutex) can be better at continuing to stay clean at lower doses as well as being generally easier to taper off of than methadone at low doses. Of course neither is a cakewalk but I would say that I think starting your treatment with fairly high dose methadone until you've managed to stay stable for a while, then reduce by 5ml ever 4 weeks or less depending on your progress until you begin to find it more difficult and cravings to use return, at this point move to bupe and try to taper off as slowly as possible on bupe from here on out. Just from personal experience, although I've not made it completely out yet, and we all have to remember it's a different and subjective journey for everyone."
ketamine,f35zjmm,t1_f35ur1j,1570699610.0,"Yeah fair enough I had no idea the two looked so alike, I fucking hate dealers that blatantly mug people off like that. I wonder whether MSG evaporates in the same way as ketamine though because you're not going to keep customers long if it ruins the evaporation process or something! The smell of ketamine as well as the strength are both very distinctive and I think it would be fairly easy to tell whether you had stuff that's cut or not as soon as you sampled some. I still think powder is much easier to cut though, as there are so many more potential bulking agents and cheaper substances that will still replicate some effects where this is obviously not the case for MSG which makes it more obvious if you've cut it."

ketamine,f35gus0,t1_f33lr28,1570677354.0,"With what would you cut long thin ketamine shards like this that forms in the same crystalline structure for less than the price of ketamine? Because it isn't easy to replicate that at all, and even if you could, it's not worth the effort of doing that unless you are selling to some inexperienced users, and in that case you wouldn't even need to bother replicating the crystal structure, which is why some people get sold table salt. Saying this is the ""easiest type of k to cut"" is really just an asinine statement, clearly the easiest k to cut would be stuff that's been cooked up and ground into powder, because then you actually can't tell if it's cut by sight alone, in fact the complete opposite of your statement is true."
ketamine,f35g6pj,t1_f334qt2,1570676814.0,"Yeah man the k belly is what made me stop in the end, I went for at least 6-8 years strong without it until I was clearly well overdue... I had to lay under an alternately boiling and then freezing shower for at least an hour or two until after the pain had finally subsided, enough that I wasn't actually moaning constantly anymore because of the insane stabbing pains going through my gut, I curled up in the foetal position naked and fell asleep and when I woke up they were gone, and that was the last time I took it, about 2 years ago, only done it once since. At the end of my addiction I was taking 5g a day so my bladder was obviously in a bad way and it is feeling so much better now, unfortunately I've had several heavier addictions since, I'm insanely prone to substance abuse because of my BPD, but I've been good with K so I felt I could have a g for the weekend for once, and it will probably last the whole weekend too as I'll be IMing it all :)"

Psychonaut,f2kmk7l,t3_ddn076,1570287160.0,"It's 100% a thing. After taking acid I would often go out to raves and take MD and ketamine and with both of those for a long time I got many of the visuals and feelings that I had from tripping on LSD. The very first time I took this combo after having my first acid trip I basically had another full trip again, obviously much lighter visuals and everything but still very much a trip lasting for 6+ hours, my friend who I first tripped with also had experiences extremely similar. My first trip was actually fairly strong as it was liquid and we were unsure of the strength so even though my ""flashbacks"" or whatever you would call them (I would class them as more than that as they were basically a trip in themselves) were weaker as time went on, to begin with they were equal to single tab trips 125ug that I have experienced since.

Since tripping more I don't really seem to get the effect replicated, so maybe it just lasts for while after your first trip, but then again I have been raving and doing party drugs less and less and I didn't smoke weed for a long period of time too so it's hard to say. I'm sure there are huge variations across the spectrum for everyone, it is not written about or researched much so it is hard to know, but I can say 100% that it is a real thing that I and friends of mine have experienced."

It seems he has experienced repeated ego deaths through the routine use of DMT, and has utilised the therapeutic effects of psychedelics to come to term with many of the ongoing issues he has faced throughout his life while putting into perspective what really matters to him in the truly out of the ordinary life he has led and continues to lead.

opiates,f256ylv,t3_dbxc4t,1569967368.0,"I really really feel for you. I don't deal with breakups well at all (that's an understatement) and even without bringing relationships into the mix I'm a bit of a liability, relapsed recently and got suspended from the CBT course I was on for BPD, so of course, similarly to you, I deal with that by using more. today I've been trying to make the effort to realise what I can do to better myself as a human, to change the way I think, my general outlook, and how to live without always using drugs to cope. 

For me freeflow writing about stuff like this is actually really cathartic and helpful, it makes me feel better just writing it down and I often learn a lot about myself that really should be obvious to me but I've often been too drugged out to notice my own characteristics, triggers etc etc. You are obviously spending a lot of time by yourself, maybe trying something like this could help you to process some of your feelings and learn a few things about yourself - I am often at my most truthful and insightful during situations as you described.

Honestly I just hope you can find a way to feel better and deal with your problems because I know how you feel, I have been at the place where I just took as many drugs as possible to try and deal with the pain. If you have anyone to reach out to please do, and if you don't then maybe contact a community service that can help you because it is out there and people want to help. Good luck bud, fingers crossed for a brighter future, sending peace and love your way."
