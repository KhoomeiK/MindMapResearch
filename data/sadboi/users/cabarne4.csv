politics,fr4ith2,t1_fr2bp29,1589889436.0,"Willful ignorance. 

My parents are both well educated Republicans. They built a business from the ground, up, under the last 4 years of Obama. With ACA mandates, tariffs on Chinese steel (raising the cost of all steel industry wide), and other tax laws under Obama, they were still able to turn a profit, but not as big as the business is making under Trump‚Äôs new plan. 

Important side note: my parents are the lowest paid employees in the entire company (minus stock options, and even then, they don‚Äôt do big bonuses / buy ins). They built their own business, sold, and are now working for the investment company that bought them out. A lot of the excess profit goes to employee bonuses at the end of the year.

Under Trump: they‚Äôve seen their employees take home more money (smaller tax withholdings). Opening the ACA to allow people to buy insurance across state lines, means people can comparison shop more for lower rates. 

It comes down to basic, core beliefs. They legitimately don‚Äôt believe healthcare is a role of government. They read news articles on how a private company found a cure for X or a vaccine for Y, and point to it saying ‚Äúsee, private research is faster and cheaper than the government!‚Äù Ignoring the fact that those studies were founded by government grants. 

The older generations remember how America used to be in the 1950s. Great, if you were a white male. They‚Äôve slowly seen their power erode decade by decade, until an entire generation‚Äôs worth of erosion is summed up with ‚ÄúOk, boomer.‚Äù

The golden society they lived through doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, and the only thing they can think of blaming is government bloat ‚Äî mandates for education, healthcare and safety, for example. Excessive government spending on tests that seem to have no purpose. Bloated military spending. 

They see a lot of governmental waste, and think about how they‚Äôd run a business, and how they‚Äôd cut excess spending ‚Äî so when a ‚Äúbusinessman‚Äù tells them what they want to hear, about how America isn‚Äôt great anymore because of all of these restrictions we‚Äôve tied her down with... they want someone who will cut the red tape, lower taxes, and let the free market take control of everything.

Obviously, it helps if you live near a national park. For reference, I did it while visiting my parents in Pensacola. Went to Fort Pickens ‚Äî an old army fort at the entrance to Pensacola Bay, that‚Äôs also a national park.

Edit: just to echo one of the other comments: check for state benefits as well! Your state may offer free hunting / fishing licenses, or waive fees for state parks.

preppers,fqty6jy,t3_gko3dg,1589648380.0,"San Antonio, TX:

- HEB has been doing a fantastic job, Texas-wide, keeping their shelves stocked. The US Government could take a page from their book. 

- Meat: Stores are running about 25-50% capacity on beef. Chicken and Pork are good for now. 

- Deep Freezers: also back ordered. A friend of mine just moved into my apartment yesterday and brought his though. 

- Fuel: I drive electric, but hearing from friends / driving around, it‚Äôs mostly $1.20-1.50 around here. 

- Unemployment: People want to get back to work. San Antonio has retail jobs like any other city, but the primary industry around here is military / government contractors. Bases have done pretty well picking and choosing what stays open. Contractors and military members have still been getting paid. 

- Store hours: most places are still limited hours or curbside / carry out only. A few local favorites have had to permanently close their doors, though. 

- Home Improvement: stores have definitely been popular. I have an apartment, though, so can‚Äôt do too many home projects. 

- Social: DIY, Home improvement, cooking, walking / biking, tailgating, unnecessary shopping trips... people are finding any excuse to gather together with friends. I‚Äôve been keeping distant, but did have 3 friends over last night working on a car in my garage. 

- Garage Sales / auctions / estate sales have all been canceled or moved to online. Apps like OfferUp are hugely popular right now. 

- Supply chain: HEB is doing an amazing job keeping things stocked, so I haven‚Äôt noticed much of a back order issue, except for some non essential products I‚Äôve ordered online. Can‚Äôt speak for many other stores, though. Car parts have been getting hard to find, the hubs / distribution warehouses are definitely running low. Checking for a specific part yesterday ‚Äî normally most stores would have one or two, a hub might have 10-20, and a warehouse might have 30-60. Currently, all stores are sold out, the hub only had one, and the warehouse only has like 5. 

- Economic movement: I have also seen an increase in trucks, as well as longer trains. 

- Traffic: definitely higher than when lockdown first started, but nowhere near normal levels yet. Rush hour still hasn‚Äôt really come back yet with so many government employees working from home. They‚Äôre definitely ramping up on construction during the downtime though. 

- Can‚Äôt speak for the DMV / food bank / anything else state run, but the state itself is pushing for reopening quickly. 

- Real Estate: homes are selling quickly, but there‚Äôs a lot FEWER homes on the market. SPECULATION: So I think the quick sales are a direct result of people *not wanting to move.* Normally summer is moving season, and the houses on the market explode. We‚Äôre not seeing any of that. With limited housing stock, the people who have to move are closing fairly quickly. 

- I don‚Äôt own any rentals / know anyone who owns a lot of rentals, but my complex is constantly sending out emails about how to apply for relief programs. 

- Internet / utilities have been fine here. 

- Hospitals: this one, I have an inside scoop on. I was doing physical rehabilitation on base, but everything is closed for COVID. I‚Äôve got a lot of friends who work at the hospital on base. They are not releasing case numbers on base, but the hospital is at capacity and running low on supplies. The DoD can‚Äôt get as much as they‚Äôre asking for from the feds. 

- Non-COVID medical: they‚Äôve been doing a really good job, actually. San Antonio‚Äôs VA was the model example for switching to video. Before COVID, we actually had the highest rate of video appointments across any VA in the country. Getting the rest of people‚Äôs appointments switched to video has been relatively painless on the technical end. Teaching old veterans how to use a computer is another story. In-person appointments can be scheduled, but only when necessary, and they take a lot of precautions. I have to get casted for a new prosthetic leg on Monday ‚Äî it‚Äôll just be me, the prosthetist and a tech in the entire office suite for 2 hours. All elective surgeries are still on hold. I have a friend who‚Äôs been waiting since March for a surgery, and he might not get it until the start of next year (according to his surgeon ‚Äî and he and I have the same ortho surgeon). 

- Pharmacies: I don‚Äôt know how well other pharmacies have handled it, but the VA does pharmacy by mail, so all of that has been working smoothly. I have a friend who uses Walmart pharmacy, and has had zero issues. 

- Mask use is still pretty high here. Most stores require them. I‚Äôd say 70-80% of the people are wearing masks. Oddly enough, people who appear higher risk (obese, older) are less likely to wear masks than people who are low risk (younger, physically fit). 

- Social distancing: for the most part, people are doing a good job. I‚Äôve seen the Karen wagon circles in parking lots a few times, but they‚Äôre in small groups and still standing 6‚Äô apart. Last night, I had to stop by the EV Charger, and had four older guys, all wearing masks, come up and ask me questions about it. Everyone wore masks and stood a respectable 6‚Äô away from each other. 

- Parks: similar to you. Equipment is roped off but walking trails are open, social distancing is encouraged on trails. 

- International shipping: basically, any product that comes from China is having supply issues. I‚Äôm waiting on an iPad screen protector from Germany. The raw material they use that they cut the protectors out of, comes from China, so it‚Äôs back ordered a few months. Deep freezers, grills, workout equipment. It‚Äôs almost scary how much we rely on China for consumer products. Even things that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù might still have an integral part from China. 

- Mechanical goods: mentioned earlier, but auto parts stores are running low on supplies. My regular prosthetist is closed, so I had him mail me tons of spare parts before they closed for lockdown. Unfortunately, needing a new socket, and my guy is still closed, so going through the VA for that on Monday. 

- Economic Outlook: our local economy is heavily military / government based, so locally, our economy won‚Äôt be as effected as somewhere like rural Ohio, that‚Äôs heavily into manufacturing large, expensive items. Car / engine production may slow, but the military keeps doing its thing. Long term, expect to see foreclosures before the year is out, and more bankruptcies. We‚Äôre definitely in it for the long term, economically. Cut your debts and lower your monthly expenses as much as possible over the coming months. Stock up and be prepared. Even if it‚Äôs just 6 months of job loss or supply chain shortages, having just 6 months worth of supplies and emergency fund can get you through a shit ton."

When I leave San Antonio, Texas, there‚Äôs effectively nothing until you hit El Paso, 550 miles later (900km). There‚Äôs a couple of small towns (Van Horn, Fort Stockton, Junction) where you‚Äôll see a few people, but it‚Äôs mostly 7 hours of nothing but empty land. 

El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico have nearly grown into each other, only a short stretch of desert between them. But Las Cruces to Tucson (about 4 hours), Arizona is almost entirely empty (you pass through 2 towns in New Mexico and one town in Arizona, but all of them are absolutely tiny, and I‚Äôve stopped for gas without seeing another person before). 

Phoenix to Tucson has a huge empty stretch between it (about 100 miles of desert without much between it). Then going Phoenix to Flagstaff, it‚Äôs 2 hours of mountainous interstate. Once you leave the Phoenix area, there‚Äôs nothing along the interstate except for Cordes Junction and Verde Valley, which are both tiny.

Ohio, I‚Äôd say is _mostly_ rust belt. You get a bit of the midwestern farms up in northwestern Ohio.

A lot of people I‚Äôve talked with don‚Äôt distinguish ‚Äúrust belt‚Äù or ‚ÄúAppalachia‚Äù though. They see New England, East Coast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, Rockys, West Coast, and PNW.

Lexington and Louisville both feel like midwestern college towns (Lexington more so on the college town aspect, but U of L plays a significant role in Louisville‚Äôs local culture). Which is why I joked about giving Lexington to Ohio, and Louisville to Indiana, since they don‚Äôt belong with the rest of Kentucky. 

Eastern Kentucky is hard Appalachia, I agree. Feels more like West Virginia than anything else. But the ‚ÄúEast Coast‚Äù ends at the Appalachians, so Kentucky doesn‚Äôt really fit in with its eastern neighbors. The ‚Äúnorth‚Äù ends at the Mason Dixon line (which effectively was Kentucky / the Ohio River) ‚Äî so, it‚Äôs definitely not a northern state. But most of the southeast agrees that ‚Äúthe South‚Äù ends in Tennessee. There was a big union presence, even though it was a slave state. 

‚ÄúWestward expansion‚Äù started from St. Louis. There was the initial Cumberland Gap exploration from the colonies, into what‚Äôs now Kentucky... but the whole idolized westward expansion of the United States was St. Louis out to California. 

So, Kentucky as a whole really doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with any of the surrounding regions as a whole. There‚Äôs pieces that feel more southern, pieces that feel more akin to the Appalachians, and pieces more similar to the Midwest. 

There are other states, like Mississippi or Kansas, that are clearly in one ‚Äúregion‚Äù, and don‚Äôt have much variation in identity. Mississippi is clearly in ‚Äúthe south‚Äù.

9 years infantry (I was 8 years intel, btw!), and 15 years working with physiotherapists? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got your kit loaded a specific way to balance the weight, and have it strapped tightly to your body, so it‚Äôs not swinging around.

There‚Äôs definitely a difference between running with a backpack, and running with a load out _and years of training and experience._ 

While it doesn‚Äôt meet your Molle requirements, my next bag is probably going to be the Transit Backpack, from Bellroy. It‚Äôs a good commuter / travel bag, which best suits my needs. 

For you, I would look towards the backpacking community. Ultralight backpackers often use packs in the 25-40L range. A 35-40L hiking backpack would have the appropriate straps and supports to secure the load to your body and transfer the weight to the appropriate points. A lot of newer hiking backpacks have external molle for attachments.

At the same time, if you take someone from NYC and dump them in the rural south, there‚Äôs going to be a bit of culture shock. So the states aren‚Äôt nearly as identical as Europeans want you to believe. 

But at the same time, even European countries have a lot of diversity within themselves. It‚Äôs not like every corner of Germany is identical.

Put a pot of water on the stove, and bring it past 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The water boils. Put that water in a pressure cooker, or in the pressurized coolant system of an engine, and it can reach hundreds of degrees while still remaining a liquid. 

Well, liquid to gas is just one transformation of matter. The same applies for solid to liquid. The temperature at which something melts, is effected by the pressure the material is under. That‚Äôs why large mounds of snow take longer to melt than the rest of it. Or why glaciers exist. Well, the same process happens inside the Earth. 

The weight of the atmosphere and all of the rock pushing down on the rocks closer to the core, put out so much pressure, that they can stay somewhat solid, even at very high temperatures. 

If you have an open caldera (like a volcano), the rock is suddenly not under pressure, but still super hot, so it melts on contact with the air, becoming magma."

If you feel better organized and feel like you can get your thoughts down better on pen and paper, keep doing that ‚Äî as long as you can keep organized. Get a file cabinet. Get hanging folders. Start categorizing and dating stuff. Mark the notebooks on their spines or covers and organize them on a shelf. As long as you can find the specific note or handout you‚Äôre looking for, zero problem continuing with that system. 

Onto the digital system: I‚Äôm currently using an iPad, GoodNotes 5, and an Apple Pencil. The app does a fantastic job organizing everything into folders and digital notebooks. I have a screen protector from a company called Paperlike ‚Äî it literally feels like I‚Äôm writing with a pencil, and I have every color I could want, different pen types, adjustable width, etc. Textbooks are all digital, making it easy to doodle notes on the pages, highlight sections, or search through the text. Lastly, handouts and other pieces of paper handed to me can be scanned directly into the app using either the iPads camera, or with a wireless portable document scanner I keep in my bag. 

Literally every piece of paper gets scanned in, titled with date and relevant information, and organized into the proper folders. I can never lose anything if it‚Äôs digitally searchable. Best part, it‚Äôs backed up to the cloud, so zero worries about failing external hard drives (but I also keep local backups, too, just in case).

Edit: reading more of the comments ‚Äî check out the Rocketbook Fusion. It‚Äôs a regular spiral notebook, but the pages are all erasable.

Flagstaff,fq8p2mc,t3_fvrtok,1589171629.0,"The main sidewalk on campus is heated, but a lot of the other sidewalks will still be snowy and icy. It also gets absolutely frigid in the wintertime, especially after the sun goes down. 

You‚Äôll want a good pair of hiking shoes at least, if not actual winter boots. You‚Äôll also want a good winter coat, hat and gloves. 

As for a car ‚Äî a FWD car will be fine. If you‚Äôre living outside of town and commuting in, you might want to look into snow tires. Even when the roads are clear, the rubber compound in snow tires is designed to grip better in colder weather. ‚ÄúAll season‚Äù tires get hard when temps get cold, meaning they grip less. Snow tires also have sipes ‚Äî little straws in the rubber, to suck up the water on the surface of ice, meaning you‚Äôre less likely to lose grip on loose surfaces. 

It doesn‚Äôt cost much extra to have a second set of tires, and one set of winter tires can last you for years if you rotate them out with summer tires twice a year.

Snow chains are only really needed if you are planning on living far outside of town, and need to commute regardless of how well plowed the roads are. I used to live out by the ski resort. There may be 5-10 times a year where I would absolutely need chains to make it home that day ‚Äî so if I didn‚Äôt have chains, I would‚Äôve had to crash with friends in town. But if I had 4WD, ground clearance and good snow tires, I could have probably made it. Instead, I was driving something low to the ground, and RWD, on snow tires. I had decent grip on most roads but still needed the chains when it got deep to dig my way through. 

I‚Äôd still suggest owning snow chains, keeping them in your car, and knowing how to use them. I-40 or I-17 can sometimes be chain-only mid-storm, and chains can be the difference between stuck in a snow bank, or getting back to your warm house. Also keep a ration bar, space blanket, flares and some bottled water in your car (drain them a bit and re-seal, so if they freeze they don‚Äôt explode), especially if you drive out of town often."

When you‚Äôre ready to cook, do the typical egg/flour/breading routine, using whatever substitutes you choose. Fry the chicken on both sides in oil on medium-high heat, then place on a baking tray, laying on slices of lemon. 

The honey caramelizes in the frying pan, sealing in the chicken juices. The breading absorbs the lemon. Once all of the chicken is fried up, toss the tray in the oven around 350 degrees for like 10-15 mins so it can finish cooking in the oven.

What you want to do, is set up a ‚Äúbase station‚Äù in your living room. Your favorite recliner or favorite spot on the couch. Have pillows, blankets, a small fan, small space heater, snacks, bottled water, medication, charging cables, remotes, etc all within reach (it‚Äôs easy to just set a small basket nearby and keep everything together).

For the bathroom, I have a tub / shower combo. So I got what‚Äôs called a ‚Äútub transfer bench‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a seat with 2 legs in the tub, and 2 legs outside of it.

Until you get your prosthetic, you want to keep your knee as straight as possible. Once your incision heals up, you‚Äôll likely get some sort of knee brace / immobilizer, and some shrinkers. 

If you keep your knee bent, the tendons behind your knee tighten up (known as ‚Äúcontracture‚Äù), and then it‚Äôll hurt like hell and involve a lot of physical therapy just to get it to bend straight again. Likewise, however, keeping it straight 24/7 can lead to it getting fairly stiff. The best practice is to keep it straight a majority of the time, and then take the knee splint off for about 15-30 mins at a time, and practice bending your knee. It‚Äôll hurt like shit at first and will feel like it‚Äôs on fire just trying to bend a few inches ‚Äî this is because your skin isn‚Äôt used to being tugged that direction. The more you do it, the more you get used to it. Wait until the wound is fully closed before doing any exercises though. 

The shrinkers are basically just fancy compression socks. Your leg will be all swollen post-amputation, and since your accident was recent, your muscle probably still has to atrophy a lot (because you only have half a calf muscle left, you can‚Äôt really activate it, so it‚Äôll just shrink down over time). Shrinking will change the size / shape of your leg, which is why it‚Äôll be a while before you get into a more permanent prosthetic ‚Äî your first few legs will have temporary sockets, as your fitment changes. 

Just 5 days in, though, the most important thing is to rest, keep the incision site clean. For now, you‚Äôre probably still in the splint you went home in. But your next follow up, they‚Äôll take it off and just wrap it with gauze and ace bandages. You‚Äôll be responsible for changing your own dressings at home, I usually did it once a day. As soon as the stitches / staples are out, you can shower regularly ‚Äî but for now, you‚Äôll want to keep water off of the leg. Look on Amazon for a ‚Äúshower cast cover‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a a little rubber boot. It‚Äôll look silly, since you don‚Äôt have a foot to fill it in all the way, but it works really well to keep your leg dry while showering."
amputee,fpw13y0,t1_fpvzh7i,1588955424.0,"You just had the amputation 5 days ago, so don‚Äôt sweat it too much! 

I was back riding a year after my accident, before I even lost the leg. Had to wear a specialized leg brace, which immobilized my ankle ‚Äî so I had to get used to shifting by pulling my whole leg up (didn‚Äôt feel like dropping big money on an electronic shift kit). 

Since getting the amputation, it took me about 2 months before I was riding again. Still getting comfortable with the prosthetic on the shifter ‚Äî it‚Äôs different than the leg brace, but not impossible.

Certain bikes are harder than others. A cruiser with floorboards, and a heel-toe shifter is probably the easiest for me to ride, sport bikes are nearly impossible since they require you to point your foot down to work the shifter. 

If you still can‚Äôt get comfortable with the prosthetic, there are plenty of other options, too. I have a buddy who‚Äôs a LAKA (left above knee amputee), who rides a sport bike (BMW S1000RR). He has an electric shift kit installed, just clicks some buttons and a little electric servo shifts for him. There‚Äôs also bikes that come from the factory with an automatic, but mostly it‚Äôs the large road sofas ‚Äî Ultraglides and Goldwings and stuff. Honda has been stuffing their DCT into a few of their other bikes, like the Africa Twin, too.

Edit: everyone‚Äôs recovery is different, though. I was walking on a prosthetic by week 5, but a friend of mine had complications and wasn‚Äôt walking until 7 months in. Listen to your docs, keep the wound clean, and stay safe over the next month! The first month or so is when you have your highest fall risk. Try to stay on the couch or in a wheelchair as much as possible. Set up your bathroom well to use everything safely. Get a good set of forearm crutches if you have decent upper body strength. I can give you a more detailed list of how I set up my apartment for post-surgery if you need."
worldnews,fpw0jjc,t1_fpvz8x0,1588955142.0,"Oh, I‚Äôm not bashing it ‚Äî a house built in the 1700s and still standing today shows that it‚Äôs well built. But maybe we should consider running electricity and plumbing? Adding better insulation to the walls? Fixing the leaky roof? You don‚Äôt just build it once and call it good until it falls over. You repair it, make changes over time. Demolish parts that aren‚Äôt in use anymore and falling apart. Build new extensions. 

You said yourself ‚Äî San Marino‚Äôs constitution is older, but was last updated in the 1970‚Äôs. We‚Äôve even also added amendments over the years. Our last amendment, in fact, was submitted September 25, 1789 (no, that‚Äôs not a typo), and wasn‚Äôt ratified until May 5, 1992. (It has to do with congressional pay increases not taking effect until the next term). The amendment before that (ratified July 1, 1971) set the voting age to 18 (it used to be 21). Fun fact: it was my aunt‚Äôs 21st Birthday, and she was so excited to be able to legally vote. 

I‚Äôm suggesting we do what we (and other constitutional democracies) have done for hundreds of years ‚Äî and make changes to our government and our constitution to better fit our needs and better handle our growing population. 

When our constitution was written, the US only had 2.5 million people. Now we‚Äôre sitting around 330 million, living in a much more complex, interconnected, digital world. Our constitution and government need to keep up with the times, making the necessary changes over the years. Whether that means instituting congressional term limits, or entirely rewriting our system of checks and balances (our constitution literally wasn‚Äôt designed to work with a 2 party system)."
