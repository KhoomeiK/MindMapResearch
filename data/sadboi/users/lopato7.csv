also submitting for consideration: josh’s proposal. pumpkin was referring to him as her fiancé in the HCHBB pilot. dumb."
TLCsisterwives,fr53vmk,t1_fr4totf,1589902038.0,I do too but I think they wouldn’t have been self aware enough at the time. Thinking of seeking sister wives here.

MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fr1auqh,t1_fr0qeme,1589816467.0,I am wondering how many generations this tradition goes back honestly and how so many kids in general slip through the cracks and end up perpetuating the cycle of abuse

MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fqzib93,t1_fqzarhk,1589767983.0,That’s a good question. My guess is it’s legally murky and the kids usually can’t pursue it since they’re left so broke. Should be considered a form of child abuse on its own imo.

MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fqz7jou,t1_fqdvlj8,1589761519.0,isn’t there a rumor that she got hooked on painkillers after one of her surgeries? i’ve heard that as a possibility for why production may want to try and “work this out.”

BravoRealHousewives,fqu8ckb,t1_fqt7sdr,1589653991.0,I tell people to start with 7 because it’s also Dorinda’s first season and if you start any later you miss Luann’s downfall.

CPTSD,fqfv6j6,t1_fqfuzz4,1589332327.0,Is it specifically geared toward CPTSD? I thought all her stuff was geared toward the average healthy white woman. I don’t have a position; she just gets talked about in social work school a lot.
CPTSD,fqfuj5r,t3_gime4d,1589331959.0,"Thank you for this. I just realized my therapist is making a big mistake pushing me to “just keep going,” and “aim for mediocrity,” in this situation. She really shouldn’t be pushing me. Period. At all. About anything. That’s the quickest route to getting shut the fuck down for reminding me of my mother. Dude... Now I just need someone to help me find the courage and skills to set a boundary with her."
TLCsisterwives,fqed4a9,t1_fqdneuc,1589305582.0,"It was more or less a story of Meri expressing her insecurity by having to exert control in every little situation and doing so in a harsh, mean way. The kind thing to do would have been sitting down with Janelle and saying, “hey, as a welcome-to-the-family, let’s change some little stuff like how we do the dishes just so you can feel like this is your household too.” Instead, she shamed Janelle over her homemaking relentlessly, which, in their culture, is even more so an attack on her as a woman.

Meri copes by keeping tight control on everything. Janelle’s more laid-back personality and different set of priorities was extremely disruptive to Meri, having likely been harshly criticized a lot herself as a child and by Kody. There’s a reason she feels so pathologically certain that there is a Right Way to Stack the Dishwasher. I guarantee someone yelled at her for doing it wrong, and she internalized that as someone “teaching” or “looking out for her” (bc trauma bonds... i won’t get into it) and so she truly does not see why Janelle is hurt. Janelle’s rejection of her “advice” feels like a rejection of HER. 

The relationship between Janelle and Meri is honestly why I still watch the show. It’s fascinating.

ETA: I think they genuinely were very close friends before they got married to the same man. The scene where Janelle goes to Meri’s house and agrees to go to therapy with her made me ugly cry, and I don’t even care what that says about me. Should I make a post about this?"
