https://www.focusmagic.com

They have a tutorial on their website: https://www.focusmagic.com/support/tutorials/forensics-getting-the-most-detail/

I would 100% go back to talk to the police. Sometimes you need to insist a little. 
Something else that might help, based on the coloring it looks like it could be a Texas license plate, no orange little blur in the middle so it probably isn‚Äôt a standard Florida license plate. 

Best of luck."

ucf,fp7ddlk,t3_gbqfaa,1588368518.0,"Contact the math department regarding pre-calc. You may be able to take the math placement test and test out of it. This depends on how well you do on the test, and if you are able to take (or retake) the test in the first place. If I remember correctly, there is a fee to retake the test, but I would ask the math dept just to be sure. 

As far as I know, there is no way out of calc 1 at UCF, unless you scored a 5 on the AP test. Since you mentioned that you need to take calc 2 and calc 3, I assume you are an engineering or math major. Keep in mind that taking calc 1 may be a good thing, since for students who are familiar with calc 1 before taking it, the class is often a gpa booster."

I‚Äôve felt that way too, and have realized how much I take things for granted. Find a way of healthy way of coping with these feelings that helps you (making art/music, writing feelings down, talking to someone, meditation, etc.) Remember that the world has been through many things, and that even though it is scary, a lot of people are helping make things better. 

If you have your friends‚Äô phone numbers/contacts. See if you can start a weekly or biweekly meetup with them via google hangouts or some other platform. One of my friend groups has been planning that out. 

Schedule a regular time weekly or daily (depending on what y‚Äôall are comfortable with) to meet with your boyfriend online/on the phone, so you can both spend time with each other and chat.

I took most of my high school coursework fully online. If you have never had an online class before, it is vital that you keep a routine/normal schedule. Wake up at your usual time. Let your family know that work from home is still working, and tell them what hours you will be working beforehand. Work on your classes just like you would normally at UCF. Be sure to give your folks a heads up when you have exams/quizzes as well so they know not to disturb you and make too much noise. 

I really hope this helps you out. Even if you feel lonely, you are not alone üôÇ"

Once I was ready to go back to UCF, I had to do a scholarship appeal for both of my scholarships and was able to receive them again. However, If I remember correctly, if you received any money from the scholarships/aid for the semester you medically withdraw from, it will need to be returned. 

If you are able to come to campus, or if someone is able to go on your behalf, I would highly recommend talking to financial aid in person about this just to be sure. If not, you can always try emailing them. 

Good luck :) and I hope that you are able to heal soon ‚ô•Ô∏è"

Baking,fim1ary,t1_filbtay,1582515500.0,"üôÇHere you go:

Place 5-6 ounces dark chocolate (60-75%) (about 1 cup bitterweet chocolate chips) and 1 stick of butter cut into pieces in a glass bowl. Place bowl on top of pot of water that is being heated on a stovetop. Let the chocolate and butter melt fully. 

Remove bowl from stovetop. Stir in 1 cup brown sugar(white sugar works too, but brown sugar makes them chewier), and 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder. Add 3 eggs one at a time and beat vigorously. Stir in a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. 

Add 1/2 cup of flour. 2-4 tablespoons more than this makes them more cakey, less than this makes them more fudgy. After experimenting a bit, a 1/2 cup is what my family likes.

Scoop batter into a lightly greased mini cupcake tin and bake for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure not to bake them too long or your brownies will stick in the tin.

Wait a few minutes for them to cool a bit before removing from the tin (it‚Äôs best to use a small sharp knife to cut around each brownie and then lift it out gently)

Enjoy!"

I would suggest alternating adding some of the flour with some of the hot mixture at the end of the recipe."
