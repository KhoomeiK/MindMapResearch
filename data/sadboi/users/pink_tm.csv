Setting boundaries and healthy expectations and limitations isnt the same as a diet. 

It's been proven that giving children autonomy over their meals helps them learn proper nutrition. Not in the sense of ""eat anything you want in the fridge"" but by providing say, their main meal alongside dessert, and letting them choose which to eat first. This takes away the power of the ""forbidden"" dessert, they learn to trust their body and figure out what it wants. 

Children aren't in control of what gets brought into the house. And while social determinants of health are definitely often at play, it remains the parents responsibility to both provide healthy food and lead by example."

asktransgender,foy2tcs,t3_ga85o0,1588163916.0,"I didnt recognize dsyphoria for what it was until I was 21 and started to transition. But I've always had it in some form or another. I have always felt discomfort within myself, like i could never find peace being in my body. I felt... wrong. Different. I have always said that my body didnt feel like home. I have always felt the need to run away and escape. I experienced sexual trauma as a child and dealt with mental health issues since then, so I always figured it was related to that. But it's not. Its different. I used to try and escape through self destructive means. I hated my body. I wanted to punish it. I was angry. I feel very disconnected from my body, like it's not mine. I've said many times that I am irritated that I have to take care of this body- feed it, bathe it, etc  because it's not mine. I never... recognized myself in the mirror. I knew it was me, but. It wasnt right. 

Since beginning my transition, I recognize this deeply rooted sense of discomfort and heaviness I carry is dsyphoria. Because, doing things that make me feel more masculine and help me pass relieves it. It is the only thing that takes it away. I never knew it was possible to feel... okay, at peace? In your body. It's not necessarily ""gender euphoria"", it just lessons the intense discomfort. It makes me feel okay. It makes me feel like my body is mine. 

I would never go out. I hated taking pictures of myself. I didnt want to be remembered. I didnt want people to see me. I thought it was depression and once I died I didnt want anyone to have memories of me. Since starting my transition, i like taking pictures. When people see me as a man, i want to be involved. I want to do things. I want people to know me. 

It pains me that I never understood what this was. But I recognize I am lucky to have figured it out relatively early in life. It's not easy, and in many was dsyphoria has increased sense realizing I'm trans. But in a way, it offers hope, because I can finally see the end to this pain. I know what I have to do to be okay. And that's the thing, I HAVE to. It's not that you know, it would be nice or itz interesting. If I want to live a full life and be happy and not hate myself, I NEED to transition. It is the solution to this ugliness I have carried all my life. And its painful but also comforting. And I cant wait to feel at home in my body.

But I know I'll never go back to women's clothes and ill never leave the house without s binder and everything I'm doing feels more right than ever. 

Give yourself time. You dont have to know overnight. I always heard dsyphoria was so bad that you wanted to die and stuff. It's not like that for me. It's a deep sense of discomfort, its uncomfortable. It feels harsh when people use my birth name. Like little papercuts all day long that remind me I'm not who I really am (showering, names, clothes). And i feel really disconnected from my body. Like, it's not really mine? And I'm annoyed i have to care for this body that I dont like.

I heavily questioned it too. And maybe you aren't trans and that's okay. But when I started doing things to present as a man, nothing has ever felt more right.  The discomfort lifts. And that's kinda how I figured it out. I still worry that I'm not really trans or like. I'm trying to reinvent myself or something.

But what I've also noticed is the more I try to pass as male, have people call me Theo, bind, etc, the more confident I am. The more ""me"" I feel, and it actually makes my personality ""better"" or more authentic. I feel comfortable to talk, behave, and interact with others in a way that feels right. Before, I was shy, never initiated conversations, basically just wanted to hide. I mean I wasnt antisocial, I could hold a convo. But it felt. Bland? Idk. And I am so much more outgoing and happy, and others notice an ""improvement"" in me. 

So I'm thinking, if you transition to who you truly are (however that looks) you might leave some traits behind, but you'll probably feel more comfortable and like yourself, and that'll shine through."

asktransgender,fmyjoqn,t1_fmyhht0,1586487793.0,"I have had serious concerns about whether or not I'm fooling myself. If I'm consuming too much trans media, my friend is trans am I just copying them, am I just trying to be different, escape, become a new person? I am extremely cautious with saying I'm trans. At the beginning, the closest i could get was ""I'm not cis"" or being agender because I honestly couldn't accept that I was trans. I was/am afraid. I dknt want to be trans. I dont want the struggle that comes with it. I just want to not have to do this. 

What I can say. Is so far, I've come out to 5 people. I was a wreck each time. I had convinced myself they would say I'm lying or I'm confused or just downright hate me. My family life is complicated, so I told friends and my girlfriend. They all accepted it, while voicing their concerns for my wellbeing. My girlfriend tries her best to help. Today, I came out to my aunt, because i knew even if she hated it she wouldn't spread my shit around. She was great. Then I found out my brother overheard. My little brother was like i know what's up, and it's okay, and I gotchu and i love you"". What I'm trying to say is, if its other's reactions that you're afraid of (and I'll admit it's a founded fear), consider if it sont be as bad as you think it will be. Obviously I dont know your situation but any friends, extended family, hell even what you're doing here is great. 

I broke down the barrier in part because I was fed up, but I honestly also gave myself a lot of compassion. What was the worst thing that would happen if i dressed this way? Reassuring myself that i have people who love me for me and i dont need people who cant accept that. Because the more things i do that feel right to me (and what's right for me may not be right for you), the less I am willing to give this feeling up. Telling myself it's okay to do whatever it is that makes me feel the best. Letting myself have an out, like I said by not committing to anything. Letting myself have as much time as I needed to figure it out. Telling myself that even if I ended up cutting my hair and presenting as a man, that didnt mean I would have to go on t or get top surgery etc. (At this point I desperately do want these things, but by relieving the sort of pressure? I put on myself to commit to medically transitioning, the more sure it's something I actually want and not feel like I have to). Also, I was tired of feeling like I was living a certain way for others. I was afraid of what my abusive family would do or say. I'm afraid to disappoint my mom. But I've been stuck in an awful cycle for years and I've never done what I want. What genuinely makes me happy. 

And yes, the bot thing was hilarious haha.

asktransgender,fmycehw,t3_fqbsw9,1586482919.0,"I just commented on a post you made recently, but I saw this too and thought I'd comment. 

You describe a lot of what I was feeling just a month ago. I was sick and tired of feeling the way I did. I thought I'd kill myself before I finished my degree. I've suffered with an eating disorder for 3 ish years and it was completely controlling my life. I was so detached from my body and who I was. I remember thinking that my body wasnt ""me"" and I was sick and tired of having to take care of (feed, bathe, etc) a body that wasnt mine. I couldn't recognize myself in a mirror. And then in a short span of time I gained a good 20 pounds. And I turned 21, said fuck it I'm ready to not wake up tomorrow and of living my life this way, I'm buying mens clothes etc. 

And if you have never struggled with disordered eating or know someone,  you may not recognize the significance of how much better I felt in these clothes. I was completely fine with my weight and body size. I then was able to see that it's not my WEIGHT I hate, it's that my body isnt right. I separated the eating disorder from the gender dysphoria. And I've taken steps since then to live as male and things aren't necessarily great, but I feel more like myself than ever. I find comfort in knowing I can do things to alleviate this sickening discomfort and unease I always feel. I can stand up straight when I bind. I actually want to live my life, even if it's only to transition and finally live my life feeling whole. 

There is no harm in trying things out friend. If it feels right, continue and dint feel rushed to go on to the ""next thing"". Go st whatever pace feels right and okay, and go back a couple steps if you need/want to. You deserve to feel okay in your skin and happy in your life."
asktransgender,fmyb03l,t3_fy4e1q,1586482009.0,"I was in that stage for years- wanting to wear mens clothes, wanting to cut my hair, wanting to go by a different name - for years I've been depressed and anxious, always carrying this deep sense of discomfort with me all the time. On my 21st birthday (exactly a month ago actually!) I said fuck it, if I dont do this I will continue to be miserable, the worst case is I'm completely wrong and I wasted 200 bucks on clothes and products i wont use. So i bought some new clothes, boxers, shampoo/deodorant, hats, etc. Everything I've wanted to for years. 

(I know clothes dont equal gender, this was just the catalyst of actually accepting I'm trans/starting the process). When I first put the clothes on, I felt immediately less uncomfortable. I actually liked how I looked. Smelling more masculine, my gf accepting me as her boyfriend and referring to me as such, this helped so much. 

But wait. Maybe I just liked dressing masculine. Maybe I'm just a butch lesbian. Forget about the fact that I've wanted my chest gone since before I knew what top surgery was, cutting my hair all off at 13, wearing boys clothes as a kid, obsessing over trans videos/stories and heavily relating since 15, and since puberty always carrying this awful pit in my stomach. I didnt have dsyphoria, right? That's not what that is. What if I'm just trying to ""fix"" my issues by changing who I am? 

So I bought a binder. I've wanted one since I was 15 or so (I've always had a fairly small chest and gave myself a lot of shit for hating it when others have larger chests), and let me tell you. I cried. That feeling of always subconsciously hiding my chest through baggy shirts and hoodies, being hunched over, that was gone. Its the first time I could stand up straight and feel comfortable. 

I grew out my body hair. Bc of lockdown I cant get my hair cut, but I hide it under a beanie. While I feel more free than I ever have, I also struggle more. It's like I opened up this box of everything I've avoided/suppressed for so long. I feel more like me than ever, while also feeling so far away from feeling whole. 

When the few people I've told refer to me by my name, when my girlfriend calls me her boyfriend, when my older brother called me little bro, i am so happy. When I'm referred to as she/her, when my grandmother says I am so pretty, the weight and pit in my stomach comes back. 

Sorry for the ramble,  but id say the wardrobe change and binder was the ""aha"" moment. Then everything I was too afraid to feel or deal with came up, stuff I didnt even realize i struggled with, or things in the past I didnt recognize at the time as dsyphoria but was. 

I'd say, if you're in a place where you can safely do so, try wearing different clothes. Watch trans videos, see if you relate. Try using mens deodorant and shampoo, growing out body hair, and binding. I finally let myself try this because it's nothing permanent, nobody in my family had to know I was living as a man at university, and by letting myself know that just because I'm doing this didnt mean I was committing to being trans. I was really afraid of accidentally intruding on a space or community that wasnt mine. And it just so happened that I was denying myself of feeling whole my entire life, and although I'm terrified and want to take this slow, I accept I'm trans. So try things out and see how you feel. Your process may not look the same but you deserve to feel like yourself however that ends up looking."
asktransgender,flxae0t,t1_flx8y4n,1585578866.0,"I dont spend a ton of time on reddit, but I do see a fair amount of well intentioned cis people  just genuinely being curious and wanting to know more, but afraid to ask in case they come off as a transphobe. In my opinion, these are te people we should be educating, because it comes from a good place. It's not their fault they are ignorant (in the sense they truly judt dont know/understand). While I understand the trans community isnt responsible for educating cis people, it is rather alarming that cis people feel afraid/uncomfortable trying to learn. Feels like we tend to block them out because they are not of the ""in group"". 

This is only for the well intentioned, curious cis people. I'm not talking about those who are asking invasive questions that they wouldn't ask anyone else (what's in your pants, how do you have sex, etc).

Developed an eating disorder, felt ""more comfortsble"" in my body. I've been suicidal and depressed for years, it's been horrendous, nobody knows what to do with me. Recently, I've gained weight and dysphoria has hit hard. I also decided to say ""screw it, I already want to die"" and get some mens clothes, boxers, and a binder.

What do you know, I feel so much more secure in my body. It doesnt fix the eating disorder, but I've realized a big part of it comes from trying to change my body not necessarily for the ""typical"" ED reasons, but to combat dysphoria. 

Always been afraid of coming out bc I experienced trauma and have an ED, and a lot of people who detranisition also have those, and I didnt want to rush anything or intrude on a space that wasnt mine.

But I'm 20 pounds heavier than I was a month ago, and I can confidently say I feel at least okay at this weight bc I present in a way that makes me more comfortable.

At the end of the day, I tell myself the x amount I'm eating is still far below what I need. The heaviness I feel, the guilt, the way I can see my body getting bigger whenever I eat, it's all in my head. Because im still below what I need. Whenever I panic, I just tell myself that. And that may not be the best mindset, but it calms me down and reassures me when I feel overwhelmed and guilty. Knowing that i physically cannot gain eating what I am eating each day reassures me when I feel big and heavy and guilty. 

And even when that doesnt work, I know I need my meds, and it doesnt matter how i feel or what i want, i have to take them with food.it is what it is. I give myself the tough talk. Too bad, you still gotta. It doesnt matter what I want. Gotta do it. And then I cry after."
