At a random check up I asked to have my iron checked and it came back low. A few days after starting iron supplements the palpitations disappeared. Turns out a side effect of low iron is heart rhythm irregularities, go figure.

It made me feel better IMMEDIATELY because it described my symptoms to a T, and explained why it was anxiety and not imminent danger. And then it gaves lots of info about how to help."
HealthAnxiety,fadjxtu,t3_e8ouub,1575975577.0,"How long have you been on pristiq? It can take 2 weeks to 2 months to start working. And if it doesn‚Äôt work after that amount of time you might need a different dose or a new medication.

I would trust that you are fine if you have been thoroughly checked by all of those doctors. Palitations and weird feelings like that are really typical of anxiety. Recently I had palpitations all day long for about 9 months. Know when it would stop? When I went kayaking on a lake for 2 hours. Isn‚Äôt that freaking weird? My guess is it was because I was distracted by my need to paddle and my anxiety wasn‚Äôt messing with me in that moment, but who knows.

Now, all that said, I don‚Äôt think you are in danger, because you‚Äôve been checked out by lots of doctors, but there could be a non-dangerous reason you‚Äôve got all those palpitations. Lack of sleep, caffeine, some vitamin deficiency, sleep apnea. Those could all do it. Again, you are OKAY because doctors have looked at your palpitations, but you could ask yourself about these other things."
HealthAnxiety,fadbujp,t3_e8n5bu,1575963518.0,"When I start new anxiety medicine I get really scary hot flashes in the middle of the night. It feels like my skin is burning. It used to really scare me, and I still don‚Äôt like it, but now I know what it is so I dont freak out so much. Your symptom sounds kind of similar.

Actually, It also sounds a bit like heartburn since you said your esophagus is burning. Some SSRIs cause heartburn when you first start them. Maybe try a TUMs?

Sometimes these medications will increase anxiety for awhile, but stick with it and keep taking them because in about 2 weeks it should get better and it will be worth it."
Psychiatry,fa0p1h8,t3_dy82kv,1575758148.0,"I worked in the records department of a police station for over 10 years and was always struck by how the police are essentially untrained emergency therapists. 70% of their calls are to diffuse domestic situations, perform welfare checks, and other similar social welfare issues. We did get annual mental health training which wasn‚Äôt enough, but it was still good to have it. 

I don‚Äôt work there anymore, but I know they now have a licensed therapist that goes on some calls. Really they just need to start offering free schooling to cops who are willing to become licensed therapists because, as I pointed out, most of their calls are for mental health issues of some kind or other.

To the original question, they never made those big decisions. If they thought someone was a danger to themselves or others, they would tranfer to the hospital for an eval. Almost always the facility would turn the person away, even in many situations where it seemed like an obvious need."
HealthAnxiety,f97u7gd,t1_f97jii1,1575170335.0,"Oh yeah, that book would do it. I read it a few years ago but I think I was still taking lexapro back then, so I got through mostly unscathed. That book mostly helps me these days because.. when I worry about death, I think about how that person went through it so bravely. But, yeah, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt read it these days.. I‚Äôve probably thankfully forgotten a lot of it."
suggestmeabook,f952g0e,t1_f94d3sy,1575116739.0,"Yes! Almost said this myself! I used to keep extra copies on hand to give away, especially when I would see them used and on sale. I don‚Äôt have any copies because I gave then all away. Also, the audio version is magic and his humor really shines through with his narration. I listen to it every time I road trip to the Smoky Mountains (about once a year). I really wish he would publish an updated version - he could add a lot about ecological changes, etc."
HealthAnxiety,f92q3ga,t1_f92cz17,1575038967.0,"Yes, I can definitely relate! What helps you when you start worrying? I‚Äôve been using lots of distraction (reading reddit, phone games, etc)."
HealthAnxiety,f92pvef,t1_f92e0yc,1575038834.0,"I‚Äôve heard good things about that book! Its even on my to be read list. Guess I‚Äôll rethink that one. You should probably also avoid ‚ÄúWild‚Äù for the same reason, if you haven‚Äôt read it already. It centers around the mom having cancer, and its a super wonderful book but really sad.. I must have been taking anxiety medication when I read it because it didn‚Äôt mess with me, but I actually did recently think about re-reading it and quickly nixed that idea.

I was about to say that avoiding books/movies because of anxiety triggers is new to me, but then I remembered that in the early 00‚Äôs I avoided the movie ‚ÄúA Beautiful Mind‚Äù because I was in my 20s and ANYTHING about schizophrenia gave me anxiety for weeks, and I also avoided this really great book about a doctor in antartica who treats her own breast cancer."
