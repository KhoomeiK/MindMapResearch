Then again that was the time period when everyone wanted to do the mosh pit thing, so you could never get close to the stage if you just wanted to watch the band play. 

I guess it's obvious, in retrospect, that our ""screw you Ticketmaster, you'll never win!"" crusade was going to fizzle out and become ""okay Ticketmaster sure I'll pay $20 for the convenience of printing out my own ticket,"" but it was nice while it lasted."

depression,ewokhur,t3_cpax3i,1565620297.0,"I miss being hopeful. That's what I miss most from the 90s and 00s. Even though things were often bad (wars, terror alerts, etc) people were generally confident that there was a future and it was going to be good for them. For all of us. Flying cars, space stations, the whole nine.

You talk to folks today and for the most part they're just exhausted. Beaten down and cynical. Resigned to working until they drop dead, resigned to a future filled with more war, poverty, and totalitarianism than even the most cynical Gen Xer of 1995 would have dreamed up. 

Like, if an asteroid really had shown up headed for Earth back in 1998, in real life, the people of that time totally would have gone the ""Armageddon"" route and put some gung-ho effort into blowing that sucker up to save the world. Today, in 2019? I think most people would be rooting for the asteroid. Or, loudly claiming that it was all a big fake news story, right up until the impact."

depression,ewdv764,t1_ewdprh2,1565308319.0,"i mean, schools let you call in sick with the flu, and there's probably kids who call in sick when they're not. Nobody seems too upset by this.

Saw this in an NPR article about the law: ""Critics have argued that students can technically already take mental health days by lying or pretending to be sick. "" Yeah, what a great idea! The best thing we can do is to tell kids to be ashamed of their depression and that they should hide it by lying to everyone. :-/

Thank you, people of Oregon."

depression,ew2k82k,t1_ew2dwau,1565048803.0,"When I applied for FMLA I had to get an evaluation from my therapist, who then typed up a nice report for my HR department. One of the items in the report was a discussion of time off from work- most of it could be and would be planned well in advance (therapy sessions, doctor visits), but also that there were times where I might not be able to come to work and would only be able to give short notice. Really no different than what a medical plan would look like if you had a serious disease like cancer (which FMLA also covers), and part of the reason for doing it is to give your boss time to prepare for your absence and to ensure that your coworkers \*don't\* get fucked over as a result."
depression,evasz6m,t3_ciyy2h,1564356388.0,"I think there's a lot of truth to that. Consider the ""celebrity diet"" where someone loses 50 pounds in a short period of time. What's their secret? They're wealthy enough to have the time to do nothing but work out all day, with the help of a professional trainer, a professional chef, and probably a dietician as well. You never get to read about that part. Just the fact that they lost 50 pounds (and if they can, why can't you? It must be something you're doing wrong.)"

That's all I've been thinking about the whole time I've been getting ready to join them. ""They won't mind."" ""Things happen."" ""There will be another opportunity"" (they camp a lot).

But I know they will be sad if I don't go. So I'm making myself go. I know I'll enjoy it at least a little bit, maybe a lot.

Also, they want me to bring the whiskey. Can't leave folks without whiskey."
