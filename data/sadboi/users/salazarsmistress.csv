boxycharm,fqhfw04,t3_giyowd,1589376133.0,"This was the box I was hoping I would get because I knew it wouldn't be the palette based on weight, and I was worried I wouldn't get the bronzer. Thoughts on each:

**Milk Makeup Glow Oil Lip and Cheek:** I love lip balms, and I have never owned a Milk product, ever. I'm glad to get this even though it's a mini. These are the sort of brands I want to see in a premium box, the whole point is to get a product I normally wouldn't pay regular price for.

**Battington Brushes:** Torn on this because I actually like the brushes and they are of decent quality. They're just not worth $90. I'm not even mad I got them, they just should be priced at their true value. Boxycharms customers are too smart for this crap. There should have been another item of higher value, or 7th item, to balance this out.

**Tarte Sugar Rush Butter Lip Balm in Peony:** I am aware there are 2 lips balms in this premium makeup box. However I love Tarte products, am a sucker for lip balms and it smells like candy. Not mad.

**Too Faced Chocolate Gold Soleil Bronzer:** I have wanted for a long ass time and so glad I finally have it! I would have preferred the matte, but this will be an amazing eyeshadow if nothing else. Swatched gorgeous and smelled delicious.

**Kevyn Aucoin Mascara:** I don't need mascara and am annoyed with getting them in boxes generally, but I understand this is the variation with the bronzer. That being said I am happy with this brand and have never tried a KA product before.

**KVD Ink Well Liquid Liner in Darkwave:** Torn on this also. It swatches amazing and I have no doubt it will be great to pay with. I love KVD eyeliners, have always felt guilt about even using them from beauty boxes due to the controversy of the brand. Now that she is gone I feel better about it. But this is bright blue...I don't even know how to describe the shade...I am all for colors and love bold eye looks, its just a safer bet to send people black. But of course blue was the discounted shade which is why its in my box. I have green eyes and olive skin, I look ridiculous in this color. But I will try it bc the formula is awesome.

All in all, I am not horribly disappointed in this box. All of the brands are there, minus the weird brushes, so it's a start. I'm aware my future boxes may be worse. I'm giving the box a 4.5 vote out of 6."
