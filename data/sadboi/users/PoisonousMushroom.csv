By promoting this to their followers they do nothing but normalize this behavior. Natural tanning is always a possibility which allows oneself to see itself differently.

Opinion: I don’t mind the self distancing although I’m an extrovert

I got to start by saying that obviously the situation is far from pink and that I’m in no circumstance glad of what’s happening now worldwide. However, the self distancing rules and quarantine as a whole allowed me to have finally some time to rest and spend some time on my hobbies and interests.
And to be honest, I don’t really miss my friends at all. I know this is definitely an asshole thing to say, but I’m happy about the peace and quiet time. I don’t have any anxieties anymore about how people perceive me, and I’m finally relaxed"
