bigfoot,fqtezhg,t3_gkt9d0,1589637665.0,"TLDR at the end. When I was a kid I was really into Loch Ness. I read all the books I could about it and then when we got home internet I researched online. I was convinced because it seemed to me that there were a lot of people claiming to see it and most of them had no reason to lie, and there were local legends going back thousands of years so it couldn’t be something made up in the 20th century.
I would get annoyed finding these cryptozoology websites that talked about both Loch Ness and Bigfoot because I thought Bigfoot was stupid. Then one day I realized that my reasons for believing in nessy also applied to Bigfoot (lots of credible people seeing it, going back thousands of years) and from that day on I believed in Sasquatch. 
In my teenage years I watched a tv special where they did some testing on Loch Ness. They showed that the dark coloring of the water wouldn’t let in enough sunlight to produce enough vegetation to support a population of whale sized creatures in the lake (I’ve never been a fan of the “nessy leaves the Loch through caves or a river” theory) so that really flagged my belief in nessy.
I would need something similar for Bigfoot. Reasonable evidence that a spread out population of intelligent apes couldn’t survive in these places. On top of that, there are dozens of natural phenomena that can account for most Loch Ness encounters (standing waves, floating logs, seals, sturgeons) but other than bears I’m not aware of anything natural that can account for Bigfoot sightings (I think most people who live in these areas know a bear when they see it). Also evidence of a massive conspiracy to create consistent fake tracks and place them in the middle of nowhere for people to find would be helpful in convincing me as well.

TLDR; reason to believe a Sasquatch population couldn’t be self sustaining, and or evidence of a mass conspiracy of hoaxers would be necessary to convince me they don’t exist"

Anxiety,fqkgkl6,t3_gj3me4,1589426835.0,"I grew up loving to sing. I think I was realistic about my abilities in that I never had aspirations of being a professional vocalist but I knew I was an asset to my church and high school choirs. In college I joined a few choirs (religious college) and  I definitely felt challenged by the directors and was impressed by the talent of other members, I still enjoyed myself and loved the challenging pieces we did. Then I took a voice class. At my school it was a prerequisite for private voice lessons. There were only like three of us in the class and the professor was this delightful little man who made a living singing professionally in Chicago. 
But while the class was supposed to teach me about proper form and technique all I walked away with was the knowledge of everything I was doing wrong when I sang (not the profs fault, he was great). I started hating rehearsals for the choirs I was in because I felt like I was the weak link in the chain. These feeling lead to the first real bouts of depression I had ever faced. I ended up dropping out of one choir before the end of that school year (my junior year) because I was so guilt ridden with the feeling that I was holding the rest of the group back. 
Since college I have tried being a part of a touring choir once but it super stressed me out and I quit after our first tour. I’ve also done some musical community theater but I am able to rest on my confidence as an actor. I actually met my wife when we were cast opposite each other in a musical. We were recently both cast in a musical that she was really excited about but the role I was given I felt was beyond my grasp because I would basically have been a featured soloist (lots of solos with no acting) and I was starting to dread the start of rehearsals but then the show got canceled because of covid so I guess I won’t have to deal with it (my wife is heartbroken about the show being canceled and I am heartbroken for her)"

My dad is was raised LCMS but my mom was raised United Church of Christ (in a more conservative congregation). I’m not really sure how their conversations went but they held the wedding in my moms church and when it was time for us to go to school we went to the Lutheran day school. So for me growing up in a mixed household meant “we” were Lutheran and my mom was UCC. We usually went to church at “our” church, but sometimes my mom went by herself to her church and sometimes we all went to her church (especially on Mother’s Day). On Christmas Eve we did 7pm at our church and 11pm at moms. I can’t speak for my siblings but it wasn’t too terrible. My parents didn’t have theological debates in front of us. I remember knowing that my mom was going to heaven. We didn’t commune at her church (and she didn’t at ours) but we understood it wasn’t because she wasn’t a Christian but because “we” didn’t agree with “them”.

That said, if your son is capable of earning that much money, maybe you should treat him more like an adult and fine him. An adult could face jail time, a fine, or a lawsuit for this kind of behavior. Maybe you could offer him a reduction in his grounding or a shorter time without his computer if he agrees to pay a certain amount to some anti hate charity? Maybe this isn’t the most helpful thought in this situation but I have heard from a mental health counselor that one of the most successful ways he’s seen to promote behavior change in a person is to get them to agree to make a small donation to an organization they don’t like if they persist in a certain negative behavior"

LCMS,fprsi40,t3_gf6yrj,1588861179.0,"Wow. I have never heard of Christian groups using personality tests so... legalistically (?). The important thing to remember about the Lutheran doctrine of vocation is that we aren’t called to things in the future. We don’t talk about being called to be a parent before we’ve actually had a kid. Our vocations are all at the moment. It sounds like you are called to be a wife, daughter, congregation member, citizen, and child of God among other things. If you and your husband decide to pursue having kids, then at that time you will have the calling of being a perspective mother (the way a student in medical school is called to be a med student, not a doctor). If things work out and God gifts you with a child then you will have the vocation (calling) of motherhood. That’s where you fit into the Lutheran Doctrine of Vocation.
As for the personality stuff, you should consider that from two directions. The first would be whether you want to be a mom. If your personality is such that it makes you want to be a mom, then great! This is considered an internal call and is usually important for us in our vocations because (as sinful humans) we don’t usually perform our vocations well if we don’t want to have them. Of course a person can still have a vocation even if they don’t want it (people who create children unexpectedly still have the vocation of parent). It seems like what you are concerned about is whether you have an external call, which is to say, do the people who know you best think that you should be a mother. I would encourage you to talk to your husband and maybe friends from church who aren’t all about the Myers Briggs stuff what they think about you being a mom. Remember that there is no one right way for a vocation to be fulfilled. You are a unique child of God and just because you don’t fall into certain personality categories doesn’t mean you won’t raise godly children in a Christ like way. Hope this helps and God Bless!"

That actually fits the trend we see in Africa where gorillas live in the mountains, are larger and more peaceful (herbivorous) but chimpanzees live in the lowlands, are smaller and more aggressive (omnivorous and even cannibalistic). It is also interesting to note that the description of the yeti tends to be similar to descriptions of high mountain Bigfoot and you can see a spread of sightings of these large and usually peaceful hominids in a U shape from the Himalayas into the Canadian Rockies and all the way down into Mexico"
