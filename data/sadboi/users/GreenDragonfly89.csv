AskReddit,fkt3lx2,t3_fkjbrl,1584505302.0,"Depends on the relationship with the person, depends on how susceptible you are to depression. 

The first person I lost was my grandma. A woman who had raised me. Taught me values I still hold today. Gave me my strength. I was 17 when she died. It was depressing for awhile because I had planned on living with her through college to take care of her. And watching my mom go through the loss of her mother while fighting with her evil sisters. But you just keep moving forward. 

I was almost 20 when my 17 year old sister lost her battle with cancer. I was angry for the longest at God and myself. I wasn't the best sister and my sister was by far the best of us and could have done so much more with her life than I ever have. 

Two years later my mom(41) died suddenly. I hit rock bottom. I didn't get out of bed for a year. Then life got so rough I moved in with my dad across country. I got back on my feet slowly. The hole began healing. 

8 months ago, my 21 year old little brother died the exact same way as my mother. I went into shock and was numb for the first few months just trying to take care of my dad, grandma and stepmom. The fact that my brother was taken the same way as my mother reopened the raw wound. I began reliving the events over and over. Along with other stresses I suddenly quit my job. Decided to be a housewife. Though my husband isn't equipped to handle being the sole provider. After 2 months, he lost his job and I went back to work. Now I have the flu and starving for hours at the smoothie shop I work at, while everything shuts down over a virus. And my husband's new part-time job has closed for the following 2 weeks..at least. So I don't have time to focus on the hurt.

Eventually life takes the focus, finances, feeding the dogs, grocery shopping. You have to keep moving no matter how many people you lose. To love is to hurt. Everyone dies. We are just late to the party."

And the church has had a part in that grizzly history. The only way Christians can help gays find their way to God's light is to live strictly by ""love thy neighbor"". Don't stare at them, point and judge. Just because they own their sins more loudly than we do. If all people would just accept and love one another as human beings we could achieve world Peace and lead more people to salvation. But that's impossible. Because human nature is self destruction.

Christianity,fk98fbc,t1_fk95m8j,1583970851.0,"Yes there are claims that God literally spoke to a man through use of a burning bush. And God's word is quoted in the Bible showing a different color. As well as when Jesus would speak, his word shows up a different color. Even references God physically, how it explains the 10 commandments. God gave Moses the stones with the commandments on them. Written by the  ""Finger of God"".  The truth is the Bible was written by many different authors. And translated so many times from it's original dialect, the world may never know the truth. Like who really killed Kennedy. There is a legitimate reason for conspiracy theorists. We've been deceived many times by human kind all throughout time. What makes the Bible any different? I mean you can't go into 4 churches and not be told at least 3 different translations of the same verse. Because no one actually knows the truth."
Christianity,fk936we,t3_fh60ke,1583967785.0,"Love thy neighbor. Since we are quoting a book. I have numerous reasons not to follow the Bible. The Bible was written by humans. How can we trust every word of it? It's been translated a million times, things could have been changed as well. It also promotes stoning people to death and cutting out eyes and limbs. Most of us have evolved beyond the barbaric customs shown to us in the Bible. I believe in God. But I was raised to just be a good person. I have never been a person who saw race, gender, or sexuality. People will live as they want to live. I will not pass judgement because I am imperfect. It isn't my place to judge anyone. Nor is it anyone else's. Except maybe a judge in the Court of law. But even he doesn't judge a person's sexuality unless it harms another person. Rape and molestation is far more serious than homosexuality. But rape and molestation was considered to be acceptable in the period in the time of the Bible's creation, where homosexuality was a death sentence. Worrying about other people's lives will prevent you from enjoying your own life to the fullest.

There are gay people in church, praying for God's forgiveness. Just as all of us have prayed for our sins. It's one thing to want to promote God's love, but to hate/condemn people because of the choices they have made is NOT promoting the unconditional love of our Lord Jesus that everyone should have the opportunity to find and experience for themselves.

Marriage,fj6vons,t1_fj6uv37,1583081166.0,"My husband says she could be feeling a connection with another man. Which is always a possibility I know. But I just wanted you to know, I experience the zero sex drive. I don't crave it. Or get excited by it. I only do it for my husband because I love him. If my husband were to leave me, id be heartbroken. I don't cheat. Even if we were divorced, I wouldn't want sex with anyone. I'd be single forever. The fact that she's telling you to fuck someone else or file for divorce says she's doesn't love you. Now I have told my husband to fuck someone else jokingly, my husband tends to harass me all day for sex sometimes. He knew I was joking. She has to want to change and seek help to be with you or you have to get out of that marriage. But it almost sounds like she already wants a divorce."
