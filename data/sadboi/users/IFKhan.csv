energy_healing,fqyvy3x,t3_glnwol,1589755480.0,"Healer here:

Your mom needs more than just positive energy. I feel she has a lot of issues he needs to get cleared up. 

Things I feel she needs:

- first she needs a general grounding and clearing her aura and chakras 
- she needs to cut cords with a lot of negativity that’s holding her captive in old ways. 
- she needs to learn to self care and forgive herself for whatever roll she thinks she played in all of it. 
- she needs to release negative thought forms and entities

She is very intuitive and perhaps even a healer. In the sense that people turn to her when they need advise. But I feel she does need other healers to help her. My advise is: start with listening to guided meditations on yt. Find someone who can do reiki for her have her learn energyhealing even if she just applies to herself. She is a strong soul. When she will heal her reactions will change and so will the actions of her husband. 

Be blessed for looking out for her."

Now pick up both your schedules and see which days are busier than others. 

Write down 7 things you want for dinner 
1 of them might be new and exciting to try
1 comfort food 
1   cook what you have in the fridge and pantry
1 quick cook dinner (under 30 min) 
1 takeaway or eat out (after lockdown) 
1 vegetarian meal
1 fried food/ pizza 

For now you can keep lunch a simple sandwich or leftovers from the night before. So just dinner. 

Write out what ingredients each meal needs. Be sure to adjust measurements to 2 people or cook more and freeze for a later day. 

This makes grocery shopping easy and fun. It is cheap because you already know what you are having and so are less tempted to takeout. And you buy what you need.

- change the lights for either shorter ones (globes or ovals) or fixed light from the ceiling above the night stands. 

- place a Plank or table behind the bed and put some plants/pictures etc on that. (Tiny just a plank with legs) 
This will create some interest and make your room less flat (also you will not bang your head on the ceiling anymore)
