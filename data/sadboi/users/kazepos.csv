depression,fjhx66r,t3_fdjpn6,1583356696.0,"wrong title , if she was your friend insteed of complaining about that she dont help you and stuf like that ask her or ask here what is wrong and what can you do maybe tell here that you feel that she doesent care about your problems but after all if you feel that way you saying seems like you dont understand her pain or of depresion 

i real friend will never say ""its so anoying"" "" real adult problems "" means that you compare problems think that you CANT DO and ofc you should lisen and help not complain

just dont speak to her if you like but you need to ask your self what is to be a friend to someone that was depresion"
