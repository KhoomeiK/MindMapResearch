computerscience,fqkt8d3,t3_gj3z0d,1589435621.0,"Recent graduate here. I remember meeting a couple of highly remarkable women during my studies... They had no issues keeping up, in fact, I learned a lot from them. My background is that of hacker culture... Staring into a terminal late at night and anonymously discussing nerdy topics with strangers on various IRC channels. Gender is not important in hacker culture. Ethnicity is not important. Whether or not you are a tranny is not important. SKILLS ARE ALL THAT MATTER. 

That being said, I found the campus area  flooded with debates on LGBTQwhatever debates. Naturally, I had some discussions with my female study partner... Clearly, she was among the brightest of all students. She told me how she hates the new feminism movement... How all of these gender quota politics have screwed it up for her. She has no trouble competing with the guys. She likes the competition and she doesn't want to be held all the way and treated differently because of her gender.

She told me at ever since gender politics started making it easier for unqualified people to enter universities (people no longer required to have the necessary skills, instead accepted into college programmes merely to fill a gender quota) she now struggles with people taking her seriously. Even though she didn't get in on a gender quota... How are people to know that? 

Some highly unqualified women got accepted instead of more qualified guys... She found that infuriating, discriminating... None of us wanted to babysit people who oftentimes just weren't even half as passionate as the rest of us. The passion is what drove us to being good at the subject. Now she felt like she had to vigorously defend her being where she was. She had to constantly make her skills apparent when around people who hadn't worked with her. She was going bonkers. Now, whenever she applies for a job... Even if she gets it, she fears she got the job not because she was the most qualified candidate, but because she has a vagina and the company needs to higher a certain number of women.

Focus on skills."
