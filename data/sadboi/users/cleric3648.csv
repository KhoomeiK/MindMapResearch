Shouldn't be plausible, but it is.  Charitable donations made by corporations are completely deductible.  I don't think there's even a limit as to how much they can contribute, as long as it is a 501.3(c) they're donating to and not a PAC.  The company will announce a ""matching donations"" program and offer some benefit to them as a fair compensation for the donation.  The company will then donate the total amount in their name, and get a write-off for the whole amount.  Not just what the company donated, but the employees too.  Some companies will fudge the numbers just enough so that this donation would cover what was supposed to be their corporate tax burden, or at least it chips away at the burden enough so that their tax bill is next to nothing.

Example:  BobCo makes enough Bobs that they would have a tax bill of $1,000,000.  CEO Bob McBobobob institutes a matching donation program to the Bobs working at BobCo, and the division with the greatest donations will receive an extra 2 weeks of vacation each and the manager of that division gets the new Tesla Model Bob as their lease for the next 3 years.  BobCo employees raises $1,000,000 in donations.  BobCo matches that to make the donations in total $2,000,000 going to charity.  Since the lease costs another $100,000 BobCo is going to deduct $2.1 million from their profits and assets so they only pay taxes on what's leftover.  After this new math, BobCo won't owe a penny because this donation reduced their burden that much, and they get a ton of good press for donating so much money.  Meanwhile, Bob Boberson is shunned at work because he didn't contribute to the thinly veiled scheme to reduce corporate taxes."

With WWE's PPV shows so close together, there's no real big build to them and they feel like another episode of Raw.  There's a very good chance I'll get the same matches on the follow-up episode that happened on the PPV, and there's no real motivation to go forward.

At least with AEW there's a build up to each PPV and it feels big.  I've shifted my wrestling money from WWE to AEW.  This was the first year in over a decade I didn't watch Wrestlemania live, and I don't feel like I missed anything aside from two interesting matches.

Watching WWE became a chore to watch to keep up with the show.  3 hours of Raw, 2 hours each of Smackdown and NXT per week, another 3 hours of PPV's each month plus Takedown every other month.  We're at 30+ hours a month just to keep up with the snails pace advancement and incoherent storylines that change on a whim.

I've recommended AEW and NJPW to friends before, but I haven't recommended WWE to anyone in a long time.  I just got to the point that I couldn't tell anyone to tune in because every time something cool happened, the next week it would be ignored or screwed up.  Remember how amazing Kevin Owens was doing against Shane McMahon, only to go from badass to begging for his job the week after he said ""I don't need this crap""?  

Now that I've rambled for a bit, I think I get why I can't get behind WWE anymore, and why they're struggling.  In the Attitude Era they built wrestlers as superstars.  They created larger than life characters that went on to mainstream success.  They left the WWE behind.  The WWE doesn't build stars anymore, they build the brand.  They might have 1 or 2 main eventers that are over with the masses, but everyone else is portrayed as thankful to be there.  They put the company over the people.  I don't cheer for a company, I cheer for the people.  I want to see the good guys succeed and the bad guys suffer.  It's simple storytelling.  Instead, we get everyone acting like the WWE is the only place in the world they can ply their craft and they're kissing ass to stay, when most of the fans are smart enough to know that this group or wrestler would absolutely kill it somewhere else.  The WWE hasn't built a star on their own in years and hamstrings anyone who goes above and beyond.  Now, it's coming back to bite them in the butt."

Is a good backup worth a first or second round pick?  Maybe.  The last time Rodgers went down for an extended time, the Packers had a losing record.  The Eagles floundered when Wentz went down in the playoffs.  The Steelers missed the playoffs with an All-World defense keeping them alive.  The Saints were undefeated when their backup came in to cover for Drew Brees.  If the QB is so valuable that one player going down can cost the season, then making sure that the backup is a quality player ready to go at a moment's notice becomes a very high priority.

We haven't mentioned the whole argument about best player available.  Every time mentions they want to draft BPA, but they almost never do.  We're looking at two situations where teams went with BPA, not best fit for the team or biggest positional need.  Two teams went with BPA, and their fan bases flip.  Jordan Love is a project now but not expected to see the field for a few years, and Aaron Rodgers is on the wrong side of 35.

It also helps that the Rams were changing their offensive personality after firing Chuck Knox and hiring Rich Brooks.  They went from a power running game to a more balanced offense.  The Steelers on the other hand were in the market for another big bruiser at running back, and Bettis was the biggest and bruisiest of them all.  He fit the Steelers like a glove and the black and gold fell in love with him immediately.  He became the closer for the Steelers.  When it was late in the game and they had a lead, even 1 or 2 points, they'd give the ball to the Bus and he'd take it home.   He earned the Bus nickname from his running style.

The lawsuit is about how the shareholders in question feel that the WWE lied about it's financial position at their expense.  The plane situation from Saudi Arabia shone a light on the precarious financial situation at the time that should have been disclosed by the company.  Had it been disclosed the shareholders would not have purchased their shares when they did because they would have seen the company was in worse shape than they proclaimed.

US Law puts a responsibility to shareholders above other debts and workers. Also, it is illegal to use privileged information that is not publicly available and only gained from an inside source to enrich oneself. This is called insider trading, and is another form of financial fraud.

The lawsuit pulls up several items where WWE allegedly committed financial fraud or insider trading by either outright lying about what they did or not disclosing to their shareholders what the correct situation was. Vince selling millions of shares to generate a quarter of a billion dollars just days before a shareholder meeting where he announced that the company did not meet their projections is an example of insider trading because he knew the situation ahead of the move and knew that the stock price would suffer, which it did.

As far as the hostage issue goes, that part was pulled out of the lawsuit for clickbait but glosses over the financial fraud that WWE allegedly performed by not disclosing to their shareholders that the Saudis were behind on some rather substantial payments. Considering how much of a big deal the WWE made the Saudi deal to be, them not telling the shareholders how much money they weren't getting paid would have cratered the stock price. The flight situation brought more bad press and attention to an already ugly situation in the main stream media. The Saudi Royal Family isn't exactly popular in most places in the U.S., and the WWE dealing with them was enough to cause some of their hardcore fan base to leave.

My personal favorite is pointing out that the QB tied with the most wins in Cleveland's stadium is Ben Roethlisberger, starting QB for the Pittsburgh Steelers."

The thing is, none of my friends bought it.  Anyone who lived nearby could hear him screaming at us from outside, so the nice act didn't last long and most people minded their own business just long enough to get back to their problems.  Most of my friends or girlfriends never ran into him since he wasn't home, and those that did got some weird vibes from him.  He'd try to act all nice and sweet, but would try to be too cute.  He'd talk to us like we were little kids, meanwhile I'm in my late teens to early 20's, and so are the people I'm bringing home.  They'd meet him once or twice, and that was it.

The only person who saw him enough times that he dropped the act is my wife.  We got into a screaming match in front of her over the mileage of the car that I was driving.  From that point on she didn't trust him, but put up with him because I felt some weird sense of obligation and guilt.  I was VLC/NC with him for a VERY long time, and the best day of 2020 so far was the day he died.

I didn't label him as a narcissist for a long time.  I treated him like a glorified stranger and was just waiting for him to die.  He had a stroke in March 2019, and I got stuck taking care of his affairs.  It was a glorious day when he croaked, because it meant he couldn't hurt anyone anymore."
