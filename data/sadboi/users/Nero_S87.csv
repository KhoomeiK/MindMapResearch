depression,f26a8qd,t3_dc2qh9,1570000104.0,"I've been suffering with severe depression since I was around 14 to and i'm 31 now (Male) Every single time i'm going to sleep I pray I won't wake up again, i'm functioning, I wake up every day and go to work but I just can't stand my life, i've been like this for as long as I can remember. I feel like i'm just not meant for this world. I'm a complete introvert, I feel like people can't stand me. I've been battling with myself in my head with all this for years and years. I don't feel like I fit in with society, I don't feel I belong anywhere, and I hate myself. Nobody ever sees this though because i'm very healthy and athletic, you'd never know if you saw me in the street. I have a 10yr old son and a 4yr old daughter and I love them but the only reason I stay alive is for them but I just don't want to do it anymore. I just can't stand this world. But I keep it all a complete secret. I don't want to tell anybody. This has been going on for way too long now and I just put on a happy face, politely shake people's hands and smile and go through the repetitive motions of life and just say (Yeah i'm really good) like everybody does ðŸ™„. I think i'm borderline bipolar and I just have to fake my whole life and it's completely exhausting. I just don't know how much longer I can keep it up. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't I need help ðŸ˜¢"

DeadBedrooms,f14ri38,t3_d7ue26,1569179640.0,"Got up and ran away!! Girl if he doesn't like your weight then screw him! If he was in love with you he wouldn't care if you were a little overweight. If you're in a relationship where he doesn't want you to touch him, you should get the hell up outa there fast and find a good man that loves you for who you are. Don't just settle for anybody"
DeadBedrooms,f145sen,t1_f143irh,1569169889.0,"That's ok, sorry but it is the truth. You do not want or need a guy like that. I used to be like that 5 or 6 years ago and just kept my patrners around because it was comforting but I grew up i'm 31 now and I realised I can't treat women like that and waste their time it's not fair. It's a waste of his and your time ðŸ˜•"
DeadBedrooms,f1433g4,t3_d7sa8q,1569168933.0,"Sorry to be blunt but he's completely lost interest in you. He isn't in love with you, he might still love you but he loves the convenience of you being around OR he just doesn't want anybody else to have you. Either way that physical attraction is just completely dead for him. Watching porn and seeking pleasure else where is a certain sign that he's just not into anymore. I'm a guy and i've had 2 or 3 past relationships where this has happened to me and i've realised and just told them the truth and had to end it instead of just leading them along for the convenience of just keeping them around for comfort. Again sorry to be blunt, but he is not for you. A guy who is in love with a girl does not do that, when we're in love with a girl we want them socially and sexually ALL the time"
DeadBedrooms,f140umx,t1_f0m2adk,1569168106.0,How's it going Sadie? How's he reacted? Have you talked about how you're going to fix it yet?
DeadBedrooms,f0fvyht,t3_d4lyut,1568589936.0,"Girl you deserve somebody who treats you better than that, god damn! My heart's breaking for you I can hear the sadness in your voice through your words. If he knows how much it bothers you like you say and he doesn't bother to make any effort and he's literally slapping your hand away, this is not going to end well and you need to get the hell up outa there! House or not. He is NOT in love with you, he loves the convenience of you, there's a huge difference. I'm a guy and I know exactly how most guys think, when we're in love with a girl we want mad love all the time! You certainly shouldn't be in an almost sexless relationship at the age of 25 that sucksðŸ¤¨. Sorry to be blunt but you need somebody who's in love with you"
