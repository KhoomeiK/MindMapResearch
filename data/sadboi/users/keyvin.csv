Asset prices and markets stabilize as the overall economy (read people who produce things) improves. It's not hands off. 

If the economic system doesn't provide broad based prosperity in a democracy, the people *will* eventually vote to make changes. QE's results coming out of the great recession are not particularly impressive in that regard. So now we get round two.

I don't regret my b450 tomahawk. The pci-e slots will allow me to step up to usb4 and keep my wifi/Bluetooth card.

Onboard audio is good enough that I felt OK with dropping my asus dgx I use with my sennheisers.

I'm not sure why anyone would feel salty about being denied the chance to spend $200+ to get an 8% ipc boost. For high refresh gaming, faster ram on zen 2 can add 40+fps.

The best thing you can do is breath deep when this happens and tell yourself it doesn't matter if it's real or not. You might have done some damage. It will probably get better. The real risk is that you have a susceptibility to mental illness and the stress from freaking out about these experiences you have causes it to trigger.

You need to get your stress level down, preferably without drugs. Walks, enya, hot showers, herbal tea. Keep a journal and document the experiences you have, and try not to freak out about them. It's unlikely to develop into schizophrenia unless you already had a predisposition - and then it's probably actually triggered from the prolonged stress.

It doesn't sound like it was organic. A brain tumor, stroke, or infection doesn't cause complicated behavior to arise all at once. It's conceivable that a focal epilepsy could trigger a sense of being watched, but it's hard to imagine it would lead to such complicated behavior.

I doubt it was poisoning - usually organic compounds cause physiological stuff (shaking, jittering eyes, etc) and someone suffering from delirium isn't capable of getting from point A to point B.

It could have been related to drugs. Some synthetic drugs bind to neuronal receptors permanently - people stay messed up until  their neurons generate enough new receptors and even then they aren't really the same. Bath salts and spice. I've seen people messed up like this - most of them get better after a week or two. It's doubtful these would show up on a toxicology screen. He also could have started a psychiatric medication and had an adverse reaction that manifested as his psychosis/paranoia.

Without strong evidence for that (texts, a friend comes forward), I'd assume it was a first episode of a mental illness. This covid stuff has added a ton of stress to everyone's life. Mental illness is nuanced and without your friend having an evaluation it's impossible to know if it was an episodic psychotic disorder, pyschotic mania, depression with psychotic features, or a chronic psychotic disorder like schizophrenia.

It can happen rapidly - when I was 25 it seemed like my life was set. In the span of a week it was all gone and I was strapped to a backboard by EMTs and police and involuntarily hospitalized. For all intents and purposes to the people who knew and loved me I was gone.  


Life experience and genetics cause some of our brains to develop little tinder boxes. The right spark comes along at the right time, and it catches fire. Covid could have been just the right stress, or removed the emotional support that kept the tinderbox closed.

I know his family likely doesn't want to hear it right now, but it's seriously doubtful a CSI style autopsy and toxicology screen is going to find anything for the reasons stated above. With grief I usually feel better if I turn outward rather than inward. Something like taking a NAMI class on mental health crisis, or donating to a cause that would have made him smile.

I'm sorry you lost your friend. Don't beat yourself up and try to keep his family from doing the same - there is no way anyone could have known what to do for him if they've never seen it happen to anyone else."

You're only guaranteed a constant access time on the simplest computers (many microcontrollers guarantee the number of clock cycles to execute any instruction - this allows for precise timings).

On x86/amd64 intel and amd go to great lengths to hide the incredible complexity of the underlying hardware. Part of that is preserving the appearance that a parallel address and data bus still exist. These buses were simple, and their operation was fully synchronized with the clockrate the CPU operated at. You could know that an operation to read data at address x would take n cycles. Essentially x =y, an O(1) operation. The Elements of Computer Systems walks you through designing such a system via software simulation from the nand gates up.

Then virtual memory came along in the 70s. Now the address you are loading from is likely mapped from a virtual address to physical address using page tables. A benefit of this abstraction is that every program has it's own simple, flat memory space. Access would still happen in constant time *unless* the mapped address your program was accessing had been moved out of physical memory. That triggers a page fault, and suddenly your memory access becomes way, way more complicated. So memory access could either be O(1), or subject to the algorithmic complexity of the page fault handler.

More's law brought other advances to CPU design like caching, pipelining, multiprocessing, astonishingly fast serial links on motherboards, and more. All of these further complicated memory access. The process by which the CPU accesses main memory is almost as complicated as fetching data from the PCIe bus (just faster).

While the binary of your program looks similar to a program from the 80s designed to run on a flat memory model, the way it gets executed is nothing like it. The assembly code you are looking at gets dynamically recompiled by the processor it's going to run on. Your CPU is complex enough that it has it's own operating system and JIT compiler.

All this complexity means that it's extremely unlikely on any modern computer that a memory access operation happens in constant time. Some algorithm implemented by the microcode for you're CPU queues and dispatches it most likely.   


For the purposes of analyzing your own algorithms, I'd assume that it does. Since the variance is hardware implementation specific, you won't know until you're seeing performance that indicates your algorithm doesn't run well on your target platform."
buildapcsales,fnroy2m,t1_fnow0c9,1587196200.0,"It's not that clear cut with the 5600 XTs. Some cards are stable at the memory OC that takes them to 2060 level and some aren't. They all use memory rated for the OC speed, but the board design may prevent the memory/memory bus from being stable at those speeds.

I'd guess this just has an OCed gpu core w/o the (automatic) memory OC."
