I would say, if you think the repercussions are going to be very bad, that is a point to consider. Only you know what your parents are like so measure the pros and cons accordingly. If you really think you're going to have a tough time with them, you might want to wait until you can leave the house.

Get all of the facts you can to back up your concerns for when you talk to her (e.g. Jehovah witnesses disallow blood transfusions even in the cases of life saving medical procedures, their views on women, lack of transparency, limitations on contact with non-JWs, etc.). JW isn't technically classified as a cult (although this is up for debate among religious scholars), but they do have some very concerning practices and beliefs that you might want to raise to her attention, but like I said, go in fully informed. At the end of the day, if she chooses to become a JW, that's her decision and right, but at least you will know you did your best to inform her.

Also, it seems she is truly receiving a sense of comfort from this group, and clearly she needs it. What alternatives can you suggest to her in your area that might be less ""cultish""? Grief support groups? Other religious groups that are a bit more open or non-denominational spiritual groups?

1. Adults are fallible, even the ones you think are perfect, but at 21 it seems this is especially clear to you based on what you wrote.

2. I had no obligation to be anyone else's therapist/mediator/emotional garbage can so when my dad would bitch about my mom or the divorce I would just cut him off.

3. I did not have to take emotional abuse from my dad. I came to see that the only leverage I had with him was my presence in his life so when he would try to manipulate or get angry with me because I wouldn't pass on his messages to my mom I would not talk to him, not interact with him, etc. In time he came to realize that if he wanted a real relationship with his daughter he had to change how he was acting.

You pat yourself on the back for ""getting away with it"" as if that somehow justifies the fact that you cheated and bolsters how smart you supposedly are. You're a cheater and don't deserve to get into those schools because of that is fact, not because of the one bad semester. Hopefully you will be caught out or at the very least college will kick your butt. Can't tell you how many ""gifted kids"" went to my ivy league Alma mater and got their asses kicked academically from day 1 because of big fish, small pond syndrome."

I know some might say that since it was his DNA as well it was his information to share but the truth is that it is your body and your medical history. I don't think it's appropriate to share medical information about others without asking or taking to them about it first and getting their tacit approval. 

And on top of that, with something like abortion there are all of the additional complexities of the political and religious views relating to the procedure. His mom will always love him but he should have thought about how sharing your sensitive medical information with her could affect you and your relationship with her.

Best of luck!"

I'm guessing your mom might be stressed out from being cooped up, maybe a bit scared and definitely missing her family. Sometimes in moments of stress we grab on to one issue and wrap all of our stress up in it; I think that's what's happening to her.

Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fmbe9j9,t3_fu852v,1585924582.0,"YTA  for sure. First there's nothing insulting about saying a room smells after you workout. I workout in my home office every morning and have to leave the fan on for an hour afterwards to air it out. Bodies stink sometimes...not an insult, it means you worked hard.

You sound controlling and using money as a weapon to bludgeon someone into doing things your way in a relationship is very toxic."
AmItheAsshole,fmanuhv,t3_ftzu4s,1585900844.0,"Yup, YTA. I hope this is fake and that you are not really someone who has lost their capacity for joy and play so much that they get all riled up over an adult liking comics. 

Honestly you are the one who sounds a bit juvenile criticising her outfit to a group of people behind her back."
AmItheAsshole,fma250e,t3_ftxe5n,1585881955.0,"I'm between NTA and NAH but I think I'll go with NTA because of her rude and unnecessary comments about your looks and home. 

I smoked for 8 years and hid it from my family the whole time (they still don't know), quit 4 months ago cold turkey.. I knew it was bad for me of course. All smokers know it's bad for them, they don't need to be berated with it. I did read a study around a month ago about how third hand smoke (what sticks to your clothes and hair) contains harmful chemicals that can be harmful to others when you go indoors, just something to keep in mind when it comes to your smoking habits, not sure if waiting a while before going inside impacts that effect.

I hope you find a way to quit but I know from my own experience you have to do it on your own terms, and people beating you over the head with ""helpful"" tips that are not helpful at all only makes one feel more frustrated and stressed out.

Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fma09u6,t3_ftxit4,1585880670.0,NTA. I'm so sorry you are receiving that kind of abuse. Are there any other family members you can live with though? I'm sure your dad loves you but if he is only a year out from recovery it might not be the most stable situation either.
AmItheAsshole,fm8ctly,t3_ftorwt,1585847056.0,Is this a real post or just a troll? Obviously YTA.
AmItheAsshole,fm80av4,t3_fti0cp,1585840347.0,"NAH. 
 It sounds like your dad is really sweet and loves you a lot. I can imagine he is also thinking about your impending adulthood and trying to hold on to those last moments where you are still his little girl who he can tuck into bed, trying to soak up every last moment. 

I also get your desire to set up your own routine and I think a compromise might be the way to go. Just be kind and remember that parents and teenagers are almost at opposite ends of the spectrum, parents wanting to keep their babies close and teens ready to stretch their wings and fly off, so he might already be extra sensitive right now.

Best of luck."
AmItheAsshole,fm7z3q0,t3_ftiobo,1585839669.0,"ESH. You guys were trying to spice things up and you got offended by a small detail that he probably didn't even consider might stick out to you...other people don't constantly think about another person's insecurities all of the time.  This was fantasy and a fun activity and you picked three small words and made the whole thing about them.

He then  way over reacted when you gave him feedback, in a very immature and pouty way. I think at least based off of this single event, you all should work on more constructive communication.

Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fm5sz2u,t3_ft9qvq,1585779340.0,"YTA. You mention things like your salary and the things you've bought your wife as if that offsets or should cancel out any desire she might have to work. Work is not just about money (although it's a big factor I know) but also about being fulfilled and productive. A lot of people are very happy being full time parents which is definitely a hard job...it sounds like your wife isn't one of them though. 

There are a lot of great daycares out there and options you could seek out for your daughter. This may not be your intention but from what you are saying it's as if you're using your daughter to guilt your wife into staying at home...with no regard for what your wife wants or feels. 

Hope you all work it out, best of luck!"

Your family will get past the urge to scorch the Earth eventually, just give them time. Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,flttio8,t3_fr4zpy,1585486741.0,"Definitely NTA. As soon as the driver swerved towards you to scare you they became 1000% the AH. 

Where I live there are no bike Lanes and you're lucky if there's a sidewalk in most places so as a driver you just get used to slowing down and avoiding runners/pedestrians/cyclists who ALWAYS have priority on the road unless it's a major highway. Sorry you had to deal with that d-bag and best of luck to you!"
AmItheAsshole,flsa0co,t3_fquree,1585437538.0,"NTA. I'm sorry you went through that. Being in an accident, no matter whose 'fault' it is is very scary and nerve-wracking. I live in the tropics so no risk of black ice here but I have been in a car in Colorado when we hit a patch and it was scary and seemed very dangerous and we saw multiple cars crash within minutes so I don't think that just the fact of you having an accident makes you a bad driver, but even if you are it seems like your SO did not handle the situation well at all, completely lacking anything approaching empathy.

I get that your husband was probably preoccupied by the thought of the cost of the car being totaled, but I would think that his wife's wellbeing should be his number one priority. I had someone t-bone me after they ran a stop sign and seemed fine at first but ended up later presenting symptoms of severe whiplash that I am still dealing with the aftermath of so I am glad you insisted on going to get checked at the hospital.

I hate to wave around the word red flag but I would be very concerned that a waitress and people on Facebook showed more concern for you than your partner. He sounds like he has a hard time reading people or being compassionate because it is confounding to me to go to a restaurant after you've just crashed when you were clearly very upset and with good reason. Either that...or he can read you and just doesn't care. I think it warrants a serious discussion.

Best of luck in this situation!"
AmItheAsshole,flenmb8,t3_fo7c4h,1585087844.0,"YTA. I totally get the social anxiety bit. I would probably have felt the same way in this situation...very uncomfortable.   
BUT, it is a public area. No one else is responsible for another person's disorders, as someone who also deals with anxiety and as well as depression I know it can be difficult to manage certain situations but you figure it out (hopefully with the help of professionals if you can afford them). 

College dorms force you into situations of compromise; including learning how to manage shared spaces and how to deal with lack of isolation and privacy. The guy didn't do anything wrong, including calling you on your bluff about the RA because he had a right to use the public space as well.   


Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,flemj85,t3_fo8ol5,1585087239.0,"NTA Part of being a good friend is being honest with your pals and calling them out when necessary.

Best of luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fldf428,t3_fnrx3y,1585063256.0,"YTA. I **might** understand if you had said that the dog showed signs of aggression towards children. But all of your issues with the dog seem very trivial (Sleeping in the bed can be easily remedied, more like a human problem allowing him to do that if you don't want it, digging the garden, also can be trained out, he probably needs more exercise...plus, you don't think your kid is going to trash your home and garden?...ooh boy get ready), and from the sounds of it your husband has kept up his end of the deal by training and looking after the pup. 

He's been with you for 6 years and you want to kick him to the curb!? You adopted him and he is your responsibility now, period. You just don't want the dog and are using your pregnancy as an excuse to get rid of him. Very assholish sorry to say."
AmItheAsshole,flddo4n,t3_fnz6x3,1585062384.0,"NTA. It sounds like your emotional (and potentially physical if it came to the point of the cops being called?) well-being is at risk with him. You are old enough to make this decision and I doubt a court would force you to stay at your dad's even if there wasn't a history of alcohol abuse. Apologies do not erase bad behavior and being intoxicated is never an acceptable excuse. 

Stay true to your gut. Your gut is telling you this is not safe for you. Stay safe OP."
AmItheAsshole,fku7blw,t3_fkosl6,1584543784.0,"So NTA. 

1. Your body, your choice
2. Pregnancy is a lot of work, especially in your case since you know you suffer horribly throughout. I can't believe she is asking you to do it knowing you had hyperemesis Gravidarum in your previous pregnancies! Also, when people have surrogates, they tend to become pretty controlling over things like diet, exercise, daily habits, do you want them trying to control you for almost ten months?
3. She wants you to use your egg?! Most donors never know where their egg is placed for a reason...there's no telling how you might feel about your biological child being raised by your sister, it might open a whole can of emotional worms 
4. No doctor should in good consciousness agree to have you as a surrogate given your medical history, it's just not worth the potential risk and definite pain.

I hope your sister and Mom stop being assholes! Tell your sis to get on the list to adopt now. Or foster and then adopt. Or, if she really wants a surrogate, then she'll have to put up the money to pay someone. 

Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fku51wj,t3_fkf2az,1584542411.0,"NTA. I'm sorry that from the sounds of it your immediate family seem like utter racist assholes. Make a new family of choice with people who care for you and wouldn't even consider mocking you.

 Also, accept help when offered. It sounds like your uncle is happy to have you so don't go back to a shitty situation out of concern for inconveniencing him.

Best of luck! Things will get better."

Ticos,fjrx008,t3_fe7nmb,1583591064.0,"Para mi es Heredia, especificamnete las zonas de San Rafael, Concepcion, San Isidro, Pero depende de tu estilo de vida claro, si tienes transporte propio o no, si tienes mas amigos del lado de san Jose o Cartago, podri ser preferible vivir en ese lado del valle.   


Prefiero estar un poco apartada de la cuidad, y San Rafa queda cerca a Heredia pero todavia ofrece zonas verdes y la tranquilidad de un pueblo pequeÃ±o, especialmente si alquilas subiendo la montaÃ±a (hacia Los Angeles o Monte de la Cruz).   


El clima es riquisimo, super fresquito.   


Tiene vistas muy lindas (parecido a Escazu solo del otro lado del valle), y hay bastantes restaurantes buenas en la zona y muchas zonas recreativas como Bosque de la Hoja y Monte de la Cruz."
