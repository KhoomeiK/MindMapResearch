Like you mentioned in a comment, I’ve read that things can go downhill pretty quickly and that is what I am most worried about. My general mentality through any illness has always been to just tough it out without meds or a doctors visit, but if I contract this I might have to think differently.... how did you differentiate the pain in your lungs from the chest pain/pressure they are claiming an emergency warning sign? Also, were you able to breathe okay with the pain in your lungs? I am not sure I will be able to tell the difference between the pain and shortness of breath, or the regular pain and a “need to go to the hospital” chest pain. I keep calming myself down with the thought that it will be better to go to the hospital and be sent back home than to wait until it is too late. I live alone so nobody will be able to make the call for me if I get to a point where i am unable to.

Did you take any meds throughout this? I’ve got some DayQuil/NyQuil on hand as well a cough drops and a nasal spray if needed."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fnn9bmg,t3_g2qrx9,1587087249.0,"Congrats on the days you have made it so far! I have been smoking daily for a decade now... I mean, wake up and get absolutely stoned for work, sometimes an edible, and then come home to almost immediately and continually smoke. The only exceptions to this were some international vacations where I didn’t smoke for maybe 6 days max. Medical weed is legal in my state and my card expired a week ago, I was previously freaking out about this and wanted to renew ASAP, put it off because of COVID. 

Fear is a hell of a motivator! I am terrified of catching this virus even though I am young (huge general anxiety that weed helps me check out from) but it terrified me even more to imagine what the virus would look like with lungs that have not had a break in years. I decided to switch to edibles, but then that edible anxiety started getting to me (I’d do around 30 mg like before). Weed also suppresses the immune system, not something anybody needs right now.

Now it has been two weeks since I last smoked/had an edible! It gets easier, for sure. When the craving strikes, I try to focus on my breathing, then start an activity or movie that occupies my mind. Honestly, my tolerance was so high before quitting that the high I was getting was....dull, and I couldn’t even get it together to quit for a tolerance break. I thought it would just be a break while I got past this virus anxiety, but I gave in 3 days after quitting and my anxiety was even worse whenever it broke through the mind-numbing high. This might be permanent for me, I feel generally better, I can breathe so much deeper and can act in and sustain urges to be productive or complete something now instead of smoking them away or fizzling out halfway through. Why are you trying to quit? 

Long comment, sorry, but I just wanted to say that I 10000% understand, give it a week and see how you feel! Might not even remember why you were so dependent on it previously (or at least will be able to forget it much quicker)

EDIT: since I’ve had my card for 5 years now, letting it expire was kind of the end-all, I don’t know any dealers anymore. But I might suggest letting your dealer know you are quitting and then deleting their number. You can always find it out again, but the fact that you would have to say that you are “off the wagon” might add an extra barrier for you"

I have a grocery curbside pickup scheduled for the 16th and am planning on popping the trunk for them and having zero contact at the store. Most of the stuff I’m buying are dry goods, so I am planning on leaving those in the trunk a few days to be safe, and then bringing to wipe down with disinfectant (which should just be precautionary if I wait at least 3-4 days, right?) For the perishable items, I will remove from the paper bags Kroger uses for pickup, place in a cardboard box to bring inside and wipe down with disinfectant, wipe down doorknobs, throw stuff in laundry. Gloves will stay on through all of this, I will then wash hands and put the perishables away with clean hands.

Does this sound secure, and is there something I am missing? I did less last week when I picked up and have been extremely paranoid about having been exposed, I want to eliminate some of that after-pickup anxiety. Thanks so much for your input!"

I am just afraid we won’t reach that state until we are all forced to go back to work and further expose everyone around us. At least right now and for the week before we shut down (due to lack of sales, not out of concern for employees or customers), the company was moderately understanding of requests to work from home. When the government is saying we should all be back at life full force just taking the “necessary precautions “, there will be 0 understanding for employees requesting to wfh in a role that normally would not be done from home or would be done better from the office. 


I might end up fighting against possibility of insubordination just because I am trying to stay home and healthy so others can stay healthy too. I MIGHT NOT DIE and I live alone so if I go from work to home, I really won’t be putting my loved ones at risk, but does that mean I should stop caring about this huge possibility of my health being affected? I have huge anxiety and just the thought of shortness of breath creates shortness of breath, I don’t want to suffer sick at home and I sure as hell don’t want to end up in the hospital over something I could have reduced my exposure to.

Any drug test done ‘on the spot’ due to accidents/injuries are a different case, but if you are regularly operating heavy machinery or a doctor/nurse responsible for others lives and might be on call from work a large majority of the time, then not smoking might be the better option. If this is that person and they use weed recreationally, there are other ways to unwind that won’t put your job and others lives at risk. If the weed is medicinal, there is most likely a legal alternative for whatever the ganja is helping. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made if you really want what you want and want to do it well.

I’ve been sober (from booze) for about 8 months now, but it has been easy because I have smoked all day every day for years and haven’t changed a thing during my recovery.

People are going to hate on this comment, I know it. But let’s please stop putting pets in situations they don’t belong and that we can’t control. The thought of all of the dogs that are injured to get likes break my heart.

Another commented mentioned, probably not with all of this in mind, that chair legs would work just as well. Or doll legs, or your hands in the heels. Or many other certainly safe choices.

IdiotsInCars,fgovmw3,t1_fgotfzu,1580988664.0,"Got you, thank you. That doesn’t work everywhere though.....This looks like the US where most states have that law but not enough drivers abide by it and not enough cops cite slow left-lane-travelers.  If I am going faster than traffic I move to the left lane, where I encounter a grip of cars going at speed limit whereas I am at 5 over...I can either pressure the guy in front of me to speed up or move (and a lot of assholes take this personally and don’t move or even slow down) or I move out of the left lane to the lonely right lanes and go my 5-over. Works in theory just need cops to help enforce so people become accustomed to it


Edit... left lane..right lane"
IdiotsInCars,fgoa14n,t1_fgo81nm,1580963560.0,"My guess is because everyone there is primarily in the right lane and uses the left lanes only to pass? That is how I guess it should all be but in the US there are very slow drivers in the left lanes and at least in my state nobody really moves to the right as standard practice. I’m stuck going speed limit or just over in the right lane, so I am absolutely guaranteed to pass the cars on my left.


Edit..just read the rest of the comments in this thread and it is confirmed, we have a lot of left-lane campers in the US!"

I don’t think it’s illegal if I’m driving (for example) at 80 mph in a right lane with no cars in front of me and happen to pass some cars going 75 mph in the left lanes, is it? We don’t see him from behind this scenario, so I am not sure he switched lanes to try and overtake.

books,fg5r12y,t1_fg5jo3g,1580535734.0,"To pretend this is not a sensitive time of change in mentality and culture and perspectives seems ignorant to me. Reminds me of Chelsea Handler’s most recent documentary..she attends an open mic event hoping to learn how to be a better white person and shares how she is filming a doc on white privilege, hoping to uncover it’s effects and how she can help. Instead of the response it seems like she wants, they come back with something along the lines of “well, that’s great, but what is that doing? What do you have to say on this? What is this changing?” Starting a dialogue is great, but one persons entertainment value cannot be another persons culture and suffering and pride. Cummin’s grandmother was from Puerto Rico, yes but that is not the embodiment of an immigrant experience.

This book was pretty bad so, on content alone, it deserves the criticism it is getting. There is the additional twist of, “why did you think you could pull this off?” 

Entertainment value is awesome, maybe we really should stick to aliens and action movies and WELL DONE social commentaries for the time being. I feel like common sense would say that, right now, we really shouldn’t be speaking for different cultures without a true understanding and ability to express their full experience.She knew what she was opening herself up to, and she failed in her pursuit of representing the voiceless - it sucks it happened in a time where the cruel white-bitch-calling extremists have access to a more public voice, but it’s not so much that she’s white, it’s that the book deserved criticism. 

Maybe I’m too sensitive

Edit.. added true understanding, etc. because there really are well done social commentaries done by differing cultures"

instant_regret,f0z3z6l,t1_f0yzu5c,1569085813.0,"Okay, I understand. Then, in my opinion, the problem lies with the training and methods of de-escalation. By the logic you presented in this and your comment above (which make sense, there are many threats in the world and decisions have to be made in split seconds), the police can and have quickly shot an innocent because the person moved too fast and were perceived to be armed. Same reason I think responders to mental health crises should be separate or specially trained policemen, because many situations require more than reflex reactions.

Maybe many will disagree, but perhaps if this wasn’t a white woman in what appears to be the suburbs, this same cops training and temperament would have resulted in death of an innocent (though, why are you provoking any armed person, I agree). 

Maybe my discomfort with most of these comments is that people are not saying Yes, this sucks but he is following training. Instead they are saying, Stupid bitch deserved it and got off easy. I wouldn’t trust those people as police (or honestly any role of authority) because that is biased thinking. This mentality snowballs into so much more than what we see in this video.

Edit: added the word ‘most’ because not everybody in these comments has the same attitudes and I did not mean to generalize. Also, looked at the post again and maybe that is the point of this post originally? As if to say, cops are currently (and historically have been) trained in this way, so don’t be dumb and provoke them in ways you know will result in possible excess of force. Again, just a huge disparity from than standpoint to “bitch got off easy”"
instant_regret,f0xllzl,t1_f0x1ttd,1569036758.0,"I don’t understand why you are being downvoted. Police are trained and should not react in this way. This is why people get shot for minor, unqualified behavior. A civilian should not be expected to tolerate poop in their face but, while the woman should definitely be punished, what kind of society are we accepting if we are at the mercy of armed authority who can’t keep their emotions in check? The other cop thought it was a rash reaction too. Cuff her and move on, don’t throw her to the floor like you are a little kid. Wow."
