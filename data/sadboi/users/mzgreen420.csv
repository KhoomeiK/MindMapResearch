weed,fqmmt9d,t3_gjr4de,1589480057.0,"Yes, the people I have met with the illness were smoking frequently and it definitely had an impact on their thoughts and delusions. If U don't want to stop, have it in moderation when U are having a good day?
 I wouldn't recommend smoking daily . Besides, it's much more enjoyable after a few days. This illness is serious and highly hereditary. Maybe read and/or watch information about the disorder and how marijuana affects it. Weed is lovely, but it's better to sacrifice a daily habit for a serious mental health illness. Put Ur mental state first, make sure u take Ur meds everyday around the same time, and the weed can be a reward, maybe note down and test how U feel when you are stoned and when U are not, do that for a few months and then U will see a pattern and U will know what to do from there. Choices determine everything"

depression,fggvh0o,t3_eye6mg,1580770469.0,"Hi there üôÇ

As someone who's been suffering chronic manic depression for most of my life, I have learned that there is no answer to make everything better. The only thing that you can do to make yourself ok is to understand what you are feeling and why you feel that way, the next step is to train your mind and make a habit of keeping it occupied and stimulated.
I won't lie, it's not easy, but keep in mind that it's very important for you, as a human, to understand that our mind is the most powerful tool.

An easy task to start with is to write 5 things you are grateful for each morning,every day. this helps keep your mind focused on the positive side of your life.

The focus is to have more good thoughts than bad.
I understand if you are feeling suicidal,
The people in your life will suffer from your death and the cycle of depression will continue

Think of things that will help make U feel better.
Hobbies, your favourite songs, watching a movie, standup comedy, colouring, drawing, reading, writing ...

I know everything sux when you are depressed and it's not a good feeling. I believe in you üí™

Maybe you could take a nap and settle your mind for a few hours? and try not to think about anything xx
IT WILL BE OK XX"

I recommend before getting a diagnosis that you try some natural tools to see if it helps, very stressful life situations can break us down for a while because we constantly replay them in our head. The trick is to be able to realize when this sadness is happening and to try a few different things. Little things will truly make a big difference like writing down 3 things your grateful for before bed, listening to tranquil sounds, learning to distract yourself when those thought do come, write down your thoughts and why you think you are feeling this way.
 Life will sometimes feel overwhelming, depression will make u feel as though everything is overwhelming and feelings of deep deep sadness of living everyday life. I believe in you ‚ô•"

There's many out there who have takin it and its also fucked them up. Maybe Research more on how psychs don't mix well with some people, depending on their mind state and so many other factors.
