BipolarReddit,fqgjmpm,t3_gikaxh,1589348032.0,"I’m currently on Lamictal and abilify, honestly works like a charm for me. I missed a few days due to not being able to get a refill and the difference was immediately noticeable (felt like my mood started swinging literally every 15 minutes). Also still remember vividly the first time I felt genuinely happy in a non-manic way after starting this combo."
EKGs,fq8v1v9,t3_ghb95o,1589176348.0,Is it fair to say that hyperkalemia or SVT are more likely diagnoses? I’m a new EKG learner but I know that the presence of distinct P waves in some leads is a good sign that it’s not as likely to be VT. Any pointers for differentiating this more easily?
