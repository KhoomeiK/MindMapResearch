 -I used less salt and added more fresh garlic, Parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes.  Also more Italian seasoning.  

-Giant ice cream scoop = giant meatballs 

-after they have browned slightly in the oven and look nearly done (mine took almost an hour)  pull them out and pan sear them on medium heat for 2-3 min w a tablespoon of olive oil.  Get a nice sear on all sides of meatball.  I feel like this makes a big difference to the texture.

-Now toss them in some sauce and simmer those babies for 30 min to an hour

Hope that helps :)"

Moms Ggakduki Recipe

Ingredients
-1 box of Korean radish (40 lb box or 8-10 large)
-2 C of kosher salt
-1 lb peeled garlic
-5 leeks
-2-3 bunches of mustard greens 
-2 bundles of green onion 
-2 Asian pears
-2 sweet apples
-2 white onions
-1 small ginger root
-2 C glutinous rice flour
-2 C anchovy fish sauce
-1 C sand lance sauce (Kanari fish sauce)
-1 C fish sauce (3 crabs brand) 
-1 C toasted sesame seeds
-5-8 Cups Korean coarse red pepper flakes (gochugaru)  depending on how spicy you want your kimchi 
-1-3 tbsp sugar or stevia (optional)

1. Chop the radish into bite size pieces and place into a large mixing bowl.  Sprinkle liberally with salt and give it a good mix so each piece has been salted.  Let sit for a few hours (3-5 hours) until they sweat out a puddle of delicious radish juice at the bottom of the bowl.
2. While you are waiting for the radish to sweat prepare your sauce base.  For radish kimchi we use a rice flour based paste to make a sauce.  In a large pot with About 8-10 cups cold water add 2 cups of the glutinous rice flour.  Heat and continuously stir u til it becomes a thick glue like texture.  After you do this you must wait for it to cool down before you can use it so it’s best to do right after salting the radish or before.
3. After a few hours have passed tilt the bowl of radish and scoop all the liquid out into a separate large mixing bowl.  Discard everything but 2-3 cups of the clear radish juice.  
4. For the sauce:  In a food processor blend the apple, pear and onion until there are no longer any large chunks.  Also use it to “mince” the garlic and ginger.  Add everything along with the saved radish juice to the cooled glutinous rice flour mixture.  To this mixture add the fish sauce, anchovy sauce, shrimp sauce, red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds.  Mix everything together well and taste to adjust seasoning or fishiness.  You can just use the large pot you made the rice flour mixture to mix everything.  
5. Chop up the leeks, green onions and mustard leaves and add it to the bowl of radish.
6. Add sauce and put gloves on and toss everything repeatedly!  Usually this is when we will taste to see if it needs more sweetness.  If it is not sweet enough to your liking add some sugar or stevia and give it a few more tosses. 
7. Put kimchi in jars and wait for delicious ripe fermentation.

mealprepsundays,f2u3zwf,t1_f2ty4g3,1570406731.0,"This is my moms recipe.  First blanch your spinach.  (Most people just do spinach but we like to add kale, mustard greens and collard greens).  After it has been drained take handfuls and squeeze as much water as you can out of it.  We do this by hand but I’ve seen people use potato ricers to do this.   Chop each spinach ball into quarters.  

Season with a few tablespoons of soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, fresh minced garlic and green onion.  We added one red pepper and jalapeño for a little extra bite.  After adding all the seasoning use plastic gloves to mix everything together really well.  If it is kind of bland add a little salt instead of more soy sauce.
