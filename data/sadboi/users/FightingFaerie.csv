We were talking about the Holocaust and discussing the impact or why Jewish people were targeted or something. Up goes my hand. “Maybe it was Satan trying destroy Jews because they are God’s chosen people?” 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

Of course I also believed back then that Loch Ness and sea monsters were plesiosaurs because they lived in the water so would’ve survived Noah’s flood. Though tbh I picked that up from a Tennis Shoes Among the Nephites book, they went into a cave in Jerusalem time and came across a water monster that the character from the future realized was a plesiosaur. I still think they are good books even if you ignore the Mormon stuff, or just accept it as part of the fantasy along with time travel."
