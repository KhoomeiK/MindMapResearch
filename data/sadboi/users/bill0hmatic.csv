SuicideWatch,f04ni98,t3_d3r4bq,1568391424.0,"okay 2 things. 

1. the best way to find a woman is to stop looking. when you’re trying to force or put high expectations on a relationship, you’re gonna overthink it and fuck it up. but if you’re secure in yourself and comfortable being alone then the right girl can only enhance your inner peace. let love find you while you focus on self love. and that leads into the second point.

2. don’t take rejection personally. there are so many factors that go into a woman rejecting you. so many that it might not even be anything you said or did. you don’t know where these girls heads are. especially in high school where almost everyone is superficial as fuck. 

think about it this way: the ratio for women to men in this world is about 4 to 1. meaning for every 1 woman that rejects you there’s 3 more that might still say yes. that’s 75%. so even if you get rejected i’m sure there are plenty more girls who wouldn’t. shit tbh one’s probably on here writing about how you ignore her for the girls you’re posting about lol just the way of the world man"
