I've been watching some YouTube channels for mine, and one does Twitch streams and one thing led to another and I'm in a few discords now and have friends that way!  Obviously he can't see irl friends like all of us, so it is hard for everyone rn. I feel like he must have some friends, so suggest reaching out and doing some sort of hangout. I'm lacking in human interaction rn; we all are! 

As for the dating.... It's really not all that great. I'm about to turn 22 and just now have my first bf. It's weird and, full disclosure, I'm not sure I even like it. I'm not sure if he ""expects"" to have a gf. I feel like a lot of guys on the spectrum feel like if they do xyz they should get a gf but it's not that easy.
