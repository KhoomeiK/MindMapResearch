BPD,foo2o4f,t3_g8bt8f,1587931313.0,I think I feel a similar way.  I have goals but my urge to die is honestly stronger. Especially since my anxiety has stopped me from doing almost anything.  I can’t even really leave the house by myself.

BPD,fobfus6,t3_g6ft9k,1587659359.0,100% have done this. It’s crazy how you can be so deep in sadness and still manipulate doctors enough that you are fine and can function enough to leave well before your time.

EatingDisorders,fki0xry,t3_fifqok,1584209702.0,I just haven’t been eating much. It’s tough though.
EatingDisorders,fk5az22,t3_fgjc5t,1583876898.0,I can relate to this very much.  I struggle with an eating disorder myself and honestly I just wish someone cared enough to find me help.  She may hate you for a little bit but if I were you I’d look into treatment centers it’s drastic but it really helps.  Otherwise try to find a nutritionist paired with therapy. That could help too.
