Edit: (actually I just tried it and after I clicked on the cropped image where you can only see the dolls flower crown it pulls up the whole image)

POTS,fcywait,t1_fcyugh2,1578088482.0,And POTS can trigger a lot of anxiety symptoms and anxiety symptoms can trigger POTS (sucks right) so taking the anxiety out of your life as best as possible can make POTS symptoms improve
POTS,fcylinl,t3_ejkkib,1578082223.0,Therapy! These symptoms for me were driven by my anxiety that was induced by POTS. Reducing anxiety and stress helped so much for me. Also guided meditations on YouTube!

lawofattraction,fcfuqpz,t3_eh5q8k,1577633913.0,So Iâ€™m trying to manifest meeting a celebrity. Iâ€™m not sure how to visualize meeting him because I figured the universe would have a plan for me so I didnâ€™t worry about HOW Iâ€™d meet him. If Iâ€™m not actually sure how to meet him how do I go about manifesting him?

Iâ€™m thinking about dropping out of public high school and finding a good homeschool program or a better highschool nearby that better suits my needs brought on my both my mental health and chronic illnesses. Iâ€™m going to go insane.... but I believe in myself I think"
Anxiety,f82s8py,t3_dyq6ao,1574197213.0,Donâ€™t cancel. I was so nervous too. But itâ€™s literally their job to help you with your anxiety. They donâ€™t care that youâ€™re anxious about the appointment and theyâ€™re not going to judge you at all! but they would probably like to know so they can make you the most comfortable you can be. It takes getting used to and I totally understand being nervous but just donâ€™t over think it because theyâ€™re professionals and they deal with what could be thousands of anxious people. Youâ€™re not alone!
AMA,f82rw77,t3_dyq84h,1574197030.0,Whatâ€™s the craziest thing you saw?

teenagers,f7n33fr,t3_dx2p09,1573882407.0,Not every girl cares about looks. I am a girl who doesnâ€™t care much for looks so I can confirm. And If you guys are laughing with each other a bind is forming and sometimes even girls who care about looks start thinking that youâ€™re cute even jt is just because of your personality
mentalhealth,f7mzyws,t3_dx22p2,1573879120.0,I feel this exact way. Good job at describing it. Iâ€™ve heard the feeling like youâ€™re faking is fairly common in depression. I think weâ€™re so used to hearing about depression being not being able to do anything or go anywhere and wanting to die all the time but obviously thatâ€™s not always the case.
teenagers,f7malbl,t3_dwyaup,1573858211.0,The best feeling ever omg congrats
