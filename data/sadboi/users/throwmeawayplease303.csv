BPD,fqg1tt9,t1_fqfxrqd,1589336181.0,"Hi! I’m sorry if the example I used about crying was too vague. Crying in and of itself is not abuse, however under certain circumstances, it can be. And I think it’s one of the most difficult signs of emotional abuse to detect when reflecting on your own actions. Like I cry a lot too because I’m a sensitive person. But it took a lot of insight to realize that I had also been using it as a manipulation tactic. Basically, pre-breakup, I used to cry if I didn’t think my partner was giving me enough attention because I convinced myself he was losing interest if he ever wanted any alone time. Now the initial cry wasn’t abuse. However, every time I did this I would basically egg myself on so that I would continue crying, and I would only stop when I received attention in the form of comfort. At the time I didn’t realize what I was doing, but I do now. And it was emotionally abusive."
BPD,fqfz24j,t1_fqfwymf,1589334557.0,"I know exactly how you feel. There are times I still want to be able to turn back time to last year when things started getting bad. Not to relive the memories, but to simply be able to treat the past him with love and respect. One of the memories that haunts me the most was one time when I SCREAMED at him for not getting out of bed, and he started crying. Still absolutely disgusted with myself over that, but I can’t change it, and I have to accept that.

What I have realized over the past month or so is that one of the most important things for me is going to be managing the guilt. For a while I was thinking “I deserve to feel this guilt. It is my punishment. I will never deserve to be free from it.” But I have to keep reminding myself that, regardless of whether or not I deserve it, drowning myself in guilt is only going take away from my ability to be emotionally attentive to my partner in the present."
BPD,fqfx162,t1_fqfr72w,1589333386.0,"Sorry if I wasn’t entirely clear. In my paragraph saying “this isn’t a symptom of this disorder, it’s abuse”, that wasn’t supposed to be taken to mean that there exist reputable sources (there aren’t) that claim abuse is a symptom (it isn’t). What I meant was that so many people on this subreddit write of engaging in emotionally abusive behavior that I think some people believe that the actions fueled by the symptoms of this disorder are synonymous with the symptons themselves."
BPD,fqfvegj,t1_fqfqdam,1589332453.0,"Yes I was. We even hung out some too. He still loved me, of course. It’s just that during the relationship, I had equated the words “receiving support from him” to “forcing him to carry the full weight of my issues while I do nothing to support myself”. The first couple weeks after the breakup, I continued doing the exact same thing, calling him crying expecting him to fix everything. But once I accepted that he had no emotional obligation towards me, I made a promise to myself that I was never going to call him or text him in the midst of a breakdown because that was not his responsibility. This has continued into the resumption of the relationship, except now I do tell him my emotions, but only when I am composed and level-headed. :)"
BPD,fqfr9dx,t3_gimjbt,1589330144.0,"I know you may get responses telling you to kick him to the curb, though personally I don’t think a short paragraph outlining this one specific problem is enough for anyone to make a decision for you regarding an entire relationship. Instead I’m gonna offer some of my experience to hopefully help you make some decisions for yourself.

So, as I said, I obviously don’t know the dynamic and history of your relationship, so I can only respond from personal experience.

I recently got back together with my partner after being diagnosed and starting therapy during our time apart. And in the early stages of us rekindling things (like when we didn’t have the title but started to act more like a couple), he seemed pretty resistant to learning more about it as well. I think this stemmed from the fact that even though things were getting better between us, he himself was still recovering from what I put him through prior to the breakup back when I had no accountability for myself and would basically place the burden of “fixing” me on him. Additionally, he just isn’t super emotionally expressive in general, so those types of conversations don’t come as naturally for him. 

Before I continue, I want you to ask yourself a few questions: Am I in therapy? What efforts have I personally made to manage my disorder? Am I supportive of him? Do I have a habit of acting on my emotions in ways that negatively affect him? 

Now to continue- I remember feeling hurt in those early stages I described because I was making so much progress in treatment. But the thing I realized was, he didn’t know that yet. Yes, it can be amazing to see the drastic internal changes that occur within yourself when you dedicate yourself to recovery, because you are witnessing your thoughts 100% of the time. But he doesn’t live inside my mind. The only indicator of change that he has is my actions. Thus, he was still in the “walking on eggshells” mode that I had conditioned him to be in all the months leading up to our breakup during which I carelessly allowed every tiny negative emotion I had manifest into an outburst directed only at him.

After realizing this, instead of getting angry at him like I always did in the past, I said to myself “You know what? I’m still healing from pain caused by this disorder. And he’s still healing from pain I’ve caused. Now is the time to focus on kindness, not on expectations.” And once I devoted myself to this statement, sure enough I started noticing little changes in how he acted towards me. I stopped trying to be on the phone with him every second of the day in order to respect his alone time, and soon enough he was calling me regularly on his own accord. I stopped persistantly prying at him whenever I suspected something was up, and soon enough he was voluntarily telling me about his struggles. And slowly but surely, he’s been learning how to actively support me again without having to worry about me dumping the entire weight of my struggles on him like I have in the past. Basically, instead of trying to forcefully enter a place in his heart that was still under construction from the last time I inhabited it, I decided to focus on making a pleasant home for him in my heart until the construction in his was completed.

We’re still working on it, but I was astounded at how much simply focusing my own output of kindness and respect naturally allowed those same energies to return to me. 

I’m sorry this got so long, and maybe my own situation doesn’t overlap with yours at all. Maybe you’ve been nothing but kind to him, and there is no reasonable cause for him becoming less supportive. I just know this disorder is intense and that some people with it act out on their emotions in emotionally abusive ways that cause their partner to take a step back, and this is just my experience with that."
