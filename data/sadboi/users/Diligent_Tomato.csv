One weekend we get up, around 7, and as usual he is watching cartoons quietly. However, every single light switch he can reach is turned on. Even in rooms he isn't in. Kind of annoyed we ask him why so many lights are on. He points to the little window, ""The man with no face! He watches me!"" 

This went on for a week. We hung a curtain on the window, and it stopped. He also used to see shadow people in his room. I've asked him about it recently and he doesn't remember."

Nope. My supervisor and I are talking in the back because he's noticed crazy lady is mad at me. She stomps into the kitchen, slams her plate down on the counter, and yells, ""I SAID OMELET STYLE!!"" Then stomps off. My supervisor fixed their bill and everything was fine. I guess?

The 4 year old enjoys age appropriate tablet time, the sandbox outside, and loves garbage trucks. He is the kid rushing out front to watch the trucks on garbage day. He's been doing a lot of PlayDoh, and getting out the dinosaur box. 

The 6 year old is a challenge. He has a LOT of energy, and doesn't always channel it well. He loves goat simulator on the PlayStation. Kirby on the 3DS. Once he's reached his time limit though he tends to pass the time picking fights with his brothers. He hates that he still has to do homework, and fights it every day.

The 11 year old is too busy for me. He's doing homework online. He's chatting with his friends online. He's playing games with his friends online. He's playing angsty songs on his guitar. Alone. In his room. I drag him out into the light as much as I can, but it's temporary. He is actually mostly good natured but just way too cool for us. He did come out voluntarily to make a batch of soap today.

I love them, but damn, I am just missing something that is required to be a good homeschool teacher. I am hating it, and I think they can tell. I'd prefer if we could just play, but it doesn't look like they'll be going back this year, and they can't afford such a big gap in their education."

The way to prevent it is to get more sleep. Which I know is nearly impossible being an insomniac.
