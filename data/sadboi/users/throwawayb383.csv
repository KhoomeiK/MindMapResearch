relationship_advice,fkmzb9m,t3_fjhcla,1584346266.0,"You are so young , and this situation is truly toxic. First off all cutting and self harm should be immediately dealt with under the care of a doctor/therapist, definitely not another peer. Once again you guys are young, now is the time for invention. 

Get into therapy for yourself and figure out why it’s so hard for you to be alone. What causes your social anxiety? Are you afraid to go places or do you feel like you don’t have friends? Is it because you spend all your time with your bf and his friends instead of branching out? Are you new to the area , if you are that is understandable..

HOWEVER .. you are setting yourself up for probably a lot more drama that you realized because at your age, guys (usually) don’t up and leave their besties for another girl. No offense. 

And also please remember, you should never allow yourself to feel “stuck” in anything especially a relationship. When you are older other men will prey on that desperation and it can turn to emotional and physical abuse . 32F . Been there done that . Good luck girlie"

My best advice is don’t look too much into it . In today’s world if he hasn’t made more of an effort to contact you - in any social platform - for a whole week... he probably isn’t super interested and was probably interested / seeing someone else before you . Just because he said he was interested/single whatever , guys are weirder than ever when it comes to communicating and the internet gives you something to “hide behind “ . You sometimes have to take what they say with a grain of salt and play hard to get see how they react . Do they give up or keep going to win you over ?. If he gives up he’s not for you girl !It’s honestly probably nothing you did . Dating is hard these days . Good luck OP

Long post but worth the read . 

I think for you this is a stepping stone to the next thing for you . It sucks but the first step is becoming self aware in the relationship but you almost need to “practice “ (can’t think of a better word ) with *someone* .. if you already recognized you may not be the best fit for each other my best advice is to not beat yourself up about it , keep working on it and stay mindful like you have been! Sounds like you are doing great!"
dating_advice,f3j2yvz,t3_dh6n1q,1570946122.0,"Hi 31 F .... I feel this happens a lot with me too . It’s either steady back and forth of just answering what I asked them with no return question after interest is expressed OR I get someone who really likes to talk about themselves and dominate the convo in that way . 

I guess I tend to think negatively due to bad experiences but I usually think they may have someone else they are talking too or still possibly swiping . I was at lunch with a friend last week and we had a similar discussion . He feels (36M) that there are too many outlets and too many options which is probably why people don’t get as involved or committed like they used too . 

Just a late night rambling thought, but you are not alone . 

I find r/datingoverthirty to be insightful!"

I have had my “friends “ say that I shouldn’t need to be reassured (for anything) and constantly say I’m being too sensitive and redic too . Maybe we are both splitting? How I try to check myself is asking “what if the shoe was on the other foot , how would this person react “ and I don’t think our reactions are out of line . A large majority of people could use regular therapy as it is , we likely are seeing it through fresh eyes and the sad and frustrating thing is , you can’t change them .

I do my phone and electric so I have  almost no bills , I should be out there,  traveling and living my best life but I’m not .

I have a friend in her 40s who is supported by family (bc she can’t get full disability)  I have been wondering if this is because we are being enabled by our parents . Like we both know at the end of the day our major shit is taken care of . You know those people at your job at that are scraping the jar for that last 3 minutes on the time clock bc that’s how they are paying their bills ....since we haven’t been in that position it’s easier to stay less motivated bc you know what you have right now is probably included as long you need it ."

It’s how our brain works . Their reasoning was something like our brain just overloads which makes triggers easier to trip . Being at work is hard to remove any trigger bc most jobs don’t just let you leave and take a walk in the parking lot to chill out when you need too .
