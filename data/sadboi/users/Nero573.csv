MasakoX,fpjngki,t3_gdv4et,1588675005.0,"I'm thinking that Gine will die. Not at the beginning of the part, but I think she will die in the end. Gine's character arc is that she is rejecting her Sayian-nature and seeks a quiet a life. At the beginning of the Android saga, she refused to fight the androids and only trained with Gohan. But then Cell attacked her and she was forced to fight once again. This time though not for Sayian-heritage, but for earth. She fought and defeated Imperfect Cell. After that Vegeta talked down on Gine, which scarred her mentally and then Cell appeared and he reached his perfection. After all of that she realized that she can not run from her Sayian-nature and the fights. Sayian and fighting are like magnets. They will always attract each other. In the afterlife she could live this quiet life and be reunited with Bardock once again.

For who will die, honestly Goku, Raditz and Gohan could transform. All of them have Super Sayian Grade 4 and when seeing someone important die, it makes sense that they could go SSJ2.

About the aftermath (aka. the buu saga) I am not entirely sure what could happen. Maybe we will see a Majin Raditz. He could blame Vegeta for everything that happened in the Cell saga and he could hold a grudge against Vegeta for all this time.


To be honest I think ""What if Gine went with Goku to earth"" is Masako's best written what if. It has great characters with arcs and depth."

But the first realization came after I had a depression  breakdown during a party, because I drank too much. This made me realise that I suffocated my feelings for a long time. 

During the time were I was depressed I also felt different emotions towards myself. Firstly I felt just really, really sad.

The Black arc is trickier, but I have an idea about that. Future Mai could be the one, who travels to the past

In the future there would be two figures fighting. One would be Black and the other could be perfect Cell. The reason for that is, neither the future androids nor Cell were killed by Trunks and so Cell could absorb them without any hindrance. Future Bulma somehow managed to survive and build a second time machine. She would request Mai to get help from the past, but while they're discussing, Cell and Black would start their battle once again. This would lead to future Bulma's death. Mai escapes to the past, but still gets noticed by Black. He too would go to the past, because the time ring would react like in the original series and so the Black arc could still happen

So future Mai would be the one to travel to the past. This would lead to Black following her and so they would still sense his energy and go to Universe 10"
