Anxiety,faaueg6,t3_e8a3m9,1575913660.0,"I'm sad to hear that. I, personally, had to deal with extreme blood phobia since I was a kid. On 3rd/4th grade I remember passing out on Biology classes and everyone (including teachers) didn't really understand me / what was going on. 

I know it is though but I decided that even though it felt embarrassing to me I wanted to make it as ""smooth"" as possible when I knew any triggering situation would occur. So it all boils down to talking and trying to explain to other people how you feel and what triggers you... some will be jerks some will be more thoughtful than you'll image.  At that time I ended up becoming friend with all my Biology professors and I had a ""free pass"" to leave anytime I was feeling anxious/bad. 

Nowadays I experience panic attacks and I do know that they aren't as ""easy"" to predict and triggers can be multiple things but I've been doing a similar thing and trying to bring awareness to everyone surrounding me. My coworkers all knows that I have it and since I was so open about it some even shared with me some bad experiences that they also had with mental health. 

If you're the kind of person that is shy about it, just know that everyone has their own personal problems and you should never, ever feel embarrassed about it. Breath, try to ground yourself with reality/present and keep moving forward my friend. You are not alone."
