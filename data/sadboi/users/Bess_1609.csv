The ex-employee when employed by company B was in continued contact with company A, particularly with the email address the ex-employer later approached. So the ex-employee new the person and the email. Considering circumstance, can this still be treated as data leakage and whether company A may still accuse company B of data breach?"

OK, what if ex-employee when worked for company B was in continues (more than a year) interaction with the email address that he has approached later on behalf of his new employer? So, he new the person very well and he new that person’s email address. Providing the circumstance, whether company A may still accuse company B of data leakage?"
