AskReddit,fqmhu27,t3_gjqgau,1589477688.0,"Poptarts. There is definitely a difference in taste and the generic is always disgustingly sweet, has either soggy or legitimately stale crust, and tastes next to nothing like the actual flavor, not to mention the filling is awful and is too liquidy. Poptarts have a good crust that is complimented by the flavor of the filling itself. The filling isnt super sweet like generic, somewhat resembles the flavor, and isnt liquidy. Also, poptart has a massive amount of flavors (even including the mistakes known as fanta poptarts). Probably the best and most accurate poptart flavor is cookies and creme. The crust is amazing unlike almost all other flavors the filling is perfect. The generic C&C is a disgrace to all poptarts because of how bad it is. Its not even good and i avoid it at all costs, its basically a sweet shitty marshmellow filling instead of a creme filling and the crust is too mushy and dogshit. The reason why the C&C poptart crust is so good is because its not as soft. With the generic brands youd be luckier to get a box with more crust that filling because of how bad and sickeningly sweet they are. The generic brands saw a cash cow and they made such a horrible product that they should be shamed for. Its like a game where you get to choose the quality of the item you make and they just put it at 0 just for shits and giggles.
