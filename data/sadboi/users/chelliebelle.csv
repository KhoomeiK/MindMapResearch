I used regatta tasks to make tons of paint and also did the event leveling tasks a couple of times.  I was easily 200+ ahead of the next person.  I went in hoping to make the top 3, but not really trying to. What I was really trying to do was get 2 for one with the regatta tasks and clear out my barn by doing the helicopter work. I have noticed that TONS of people cheat at the mini games and to combat that, I have vowed to not blow t-cash on them. Once you decide not to spend your hard earned t cash,  it becomes fun again. Just my take."
