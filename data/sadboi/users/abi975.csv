Christianity,fr3r5rc,t1_fr3mf4u,1589864036.0,*sister lol but thank you so much!!
Christianity,fr3kvlb,t1_fr3egpa,1589859637.0,"Thank you. It’s just, I feel like the only way to get a do over would be to fly away from everything and everyone and not come back."
Christianity,fr3kt0n,t1_fr3dqsv,1589859592.0,"I watched it. Thank you, he explained it very well. I appreciate you for sharing that with me."
Christianity,fr3krkc,t1_fr3hixq,1589859566.0,Thank you. I just wish it was easier. I want it all to be worth it. I’ve been through a lot of things.
Christianity,fr3ed12,t1_fr3e12d,1589855593.0,I’d love a do over.
Christianity,fr3ecdf,t1_fr3e609,1589855582.0,Thank you so much.
Christianity,fr3dyxd,t1_fr3d5cm,1589855351.0,Thank you. I really appreciate that. It hurts to hear that.
Christianity,fr3dw53,t1_fr3d08f,1589855305.0,I appreciate your words. You’re right it’s not God’s fault how others treat me. But I’m just in a lot of pain and starting to wonder if my purpose  is just to live a miserable life.
Christianity,fr3drnb,t1_fr3cvrg,1589855229.0,"Trust me, I don’t expect everything to be fine. I grew up a PK. And I know the Bible doesn’t promise perfection. But I also know, that I have not been happy for a second in about a decade. I’m in pain."
Christianity,fr3cq9a,t1_fr3choc,1589854596.0,"Hard to be passionate about much when your life is as terrible as it is. When you constantly hear about how terrible you are, how stupid you are, how incapable of love you are, it’s hard to even want to live."
Christianity,fr3clgv,t1_fr3cj01,1589854514.0,But God loves everyone right? Not just people that follow him whole-heartedly?
Christianity,fr3cg04,t1_fr3cbtj,1589854423.0,"But it’s been 8 years and I’ve been miserable for 8 years. Does he see that? Does he care? If so, why doesn’t he stop it?"
keto,fquukg5,t3_gk6852,1589664779.0,I’ve lost 11 pounds! A pair of jeans that I know wouldn’t have fit three weeks ago now fit. And I had a friend in the grocery store notice I’ve lost weight!
depression,fquet2e,t3_gktyww,1589657627.0,Take it a step at a time. I’m right there with you friend. Just do one thing headed in that direction today. Even if the only thing you do is shower.
keto,fqu4n3y,t1_fqszf7m,1589651939.0,I can totally see that being the case for me! The only thing I really want to eat is fried foods but I’m not giving it to my body so it makes since that my body is having to accept that I’m not going to eat what I normally do. Definitely have lost my desire to eat and not taking in enough calories for sure. Glad to know it passed for you! I’m on week 3.
keto,fqu4gmi,t1_fqt3j3p,1589651841.0,I feel that I was gluten intolerant too! Because I used to have severe acid reflux that would cause me to throw up almost daily and I haven’t had that once since I’ve started keto. Interesting.
keto,fqssw43,t1_fqsdz1n,1589617682.0,"No, but it does seem that way lol"
keto,fqrv8fi,t1_fqrtlxi,1589592615.0,Interesting! Thank you for this!
Christianity,fq4gu28,t1_fpnrgqm,1589077576.0,"Yes but also the perspective of others (friends, family, etc). I would like to believe that I am a good person. That I have value and bring value to other’s lives. That I’m not a burden or as awkward as I feel. I think it would be amazing to be happy knowing that I’m imperfect and that that’s okay."
Christianity,fplwdml,t3_ge1ixl,1588720749.0,"Yes. You get forgiven when you ask for forgiveness. I’m not an expert. But, would it possibly make you feel better to apologize to the people you feel you hurt. You could write them letters (even if you can’t send them because of circumstances). Then, write a letter to yourself and apologize to yourself. It’s not fun being so hard on yourself. I get that from experience. God loves you and wants you to love yourself and forgive yourself."
Christianity,fplw13a,t1_fplehno,1588720557.0,Thank you. I’m trying.
Christianity,fplvzq7,t1_fplbag9,1588720536.0,Thank you.
Christianity,fplvw1v,t1_fplklzy,1588720482.0,I want to see what God sees in me. I want to believe what he believes and I want to stop being so hard on myself. I want to accept that people are imperfect beings. And that that’s okay.
Christianity,fpl9vyq,t1_fpl99n5,1588708928.0,"Yes, that all rings true."
depression,fpl89dl,t1_fpl8566,1588708118.0,Life sucks.
depression,fpl7yh5,t1_fpl7rf4,1588707964.0,I’m about to go buy a bike and just go riding. Whatever to get my mind off of things. I just embarrassed myself in a virtual meeting and I feel like crawling back into a corner again.
depression,fpl7m63,t1_fov3ujm,1588707794.0,Yes! Wow! You sound exactly like me.
depression,fpl7kjk,t1_fpiwqfg,1588707772.0,I’m trying man I’m really trying.
depression,fosltd2,t3_g994gy,1588033251.0,I’m glad that you do. I’ll be thinking about you.
depression,forz9cm,t1_foryxda,1588021115.0,"Yeah, those brief moments or the moments with my family. I feel sometimes I hold on just to prevent them from pain. But it makes it hard on me. I’m glad that you have something to hang on to, too. Even though it’s hard."
Anxiety,fokm8ns,t1_foei94b,1587844700.0,Love this list! I also want a bike!!!
depression,fo8n1bw,t1_fo82gz4,1587599780.0,Thanks. I’ve been binge watching greys anatomy and ordered my favorite Thai food but it can only distract me for so long.
depression,fo8myjv,t1_fo8ejad,1587599734.0,Yes.. I’m sorry you know what this feels like.
depression,fo7iwpq,t1_fo69kup,1587579106.0,Why so?
depression,fo5mq5c,t3_g5n8c2,1587529559.0,I relate so much to this. Feel free to message me if you want to talk. I get it.
depression,fo5mliu,t1_fo5kw0t,1587529459.0,I’ve been on medicine for a while. It used to help but now it doesn’t. I’ll try but I’m miserable and not sure it’s even worth the headache.
depression,fmnfps5,t1_fmncv13,1586225018.0,I have the same problem with food textures.
depression,f7cstbo,t1_f6l5mff,1573599208.0,Thank you
depression,f7cso7y,t1_f6khorv,1573599122.0,I don’t have any interests :(
depression,f7cskxp,t1_f6l8wgg,1573599066.0,That’s part of my problem. I don’t like to do anything and nothing interests me. I have no where to put my energy and so it’s just wearing thin.
depression,f5a8mga,t1_f5a6q9f,1572102480.0,I signed a contract. Can’t leave for a year
Anxiety,f4u3s8o,t1_f4tluar,1571798401.0,I’m glad that’s it’s given you some peace but I do think my problems are too big for a counselor.
Anxiety,f4u3m24,t1_f4tca13,1571798277.0,I am the exact same way. I work but I’m miserable. I have to please people at my job and I am always freaking out. My boyfriend isn’t very understanding of my condition. I literally will probably be homeless eventually. Because I am so sick and I can’t handle what life expects of me. And I don’t have anyone to support me or help me so I can stay at home.
Anxiety,f4taonr,t1_f4t9il1,1571786044.0,"Yes! It is agony.. I’ve considered therapy although, I tend to avoid all social conversations all together because like you said I worry I might have said or done something to accidentally offend or hurt someone. I honestly get concerned I’ll end up homeless one day because I seriously have the hardest time working because I worry about offending everyone."
Anxiety,f4t8g5o,t1_f4t7xyg,1571785295.0,I’m sorry that you are the same because it’s not fun. Although I hope it gives you some peace knowing you’re not alone. Sometimes I distance myself from people because I’m afraid I can’t please them.
books,f4ckp9f,t1_f4cje9y,1571530419.0,"Yeah, everyone has time for that."
books,f4c6sdn,t1_f49axz0,1571524902.0,Reddit is so annoying lol
relationship_advice,f16073m,t1_f15xkv9,1569199518.0,Thank you so much.
relationship_advice,f15x4as,t1_f15wwvs,1569197881.0,And you don’t know how to talk to people.
relationship_advice,f15wea1,t1_f15w88h,1569197506.0,I really wasn’t asking your opinion on my size. I’ve heard enough about that obviously.
relationship_advice,f15vwz2,t1_f15tw4w,1569197254.0,I am overweight. Definitely not the skinniest girl in the world. I used to work out daily in college but now that I’ve started my job I don’t have time. I’m guessing he misses my old size. I’m 5’2 and 190. Not sure why it even matters though.
relationship_advice,f15py1w,t1_f15nymu,1569194190.0,Nothing. He says really harsh things like this all of the time out of nowhere. And never apologizes.
depression,f0kd83s,t1_f0h5nva,1568676607.0,Thank you so much for this. I’m mainly worried of hearing “intoxicated girl at music midtown” etc etc. I did have something to drink but was sick from lack of water/heat. I’m sure the alcohol didn’t help the heat exhaustion though of course. But I’m just embarrassed.
depression,f0gucrb,t1_f0glf8q,1568606382.0,Thank you for this. I hope that I can live more comfortably over the years too. This isn’t a way to live.
depression,f0gitzo,t1_f0gfil9,1568600381.0,Never heard of this technique. Thank you for sharing!
depression,f0gcfrb,t1_f0gboaf,1568597257.0,Thank you for this. It is so hard to get rational. I tend to be very irrational because of my anxiety. It’s hard for me to get a clear grip on reality.
depression,f0gc7l9,t1_f0gbguf,1568597150.0,I would be happy to talk. Thank you for the logic. I think we all need that sometimes. I tend to be irrational. I’ll message you.
depression,f0gait2,t1_f0ga2pz,1568596306.0,Thank you. I know you’re thinking logically. It’s just so hard for me to be reasonable with myself.
Anxiety,f0emfew,t3_d4izw8,1568570448.0,Omg this is so crazy I just posted about having anxiety over this!
depression,exbwwbm,t3_cruf0x,1566139406.0,Every single day.
depression,ewsq6v9,t3_cpidz8,1565732897.0,"I used to tell my mom as a kid “I want to go home” while sobbing. My mom was always so lost as to what I meant because I was at my only home. Looking back now, I am sure that this was my first sign of depression."
