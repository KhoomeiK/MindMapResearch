OP also doesn’t seem to understand why her sister is so upset, nor why her husband’s comment was in poor taste. I also think she’s acting a little strange about the Instagram post. It has zero impact on her and it shows once again that her sister is having troubles grieving, yet she’s using it to justify that her sister’s the AH. 

I honestly think it might be because OP and her family don’t quite get what her sister went through. At 20 weeks it’s not just “a miscarriage”, it’s a stillbirth. That’s extremely traumatic. OP and her family should be speaking about and recognizing this. Instead they’ve pretty much brushed her off after a day of sympathy. If they went and asked her “hey are you okay?” they’d probably find out she’s not pretty quick.

Edit: 
Also I think her last comment really illustrates her lack of empathy. That there is so much happening in the world that she’s not what they think about. Like sure wow. You have time to talk about how great your pregnancy is, how crappy lockdown is, but your sister who gave birth to a dead baby only WEEKS ago. Screw her.

Family and OP should be helping her look into this, especially since she’s showing such massive red flags. Sister’s health and mental health is just as important as OP’s.

I would recommend standing up straight, get your grips, move, then throw. You probably practice most of your throws from an upright position, so try to find that same upright position when you’re fighting (easier said than done). Besides that, good work! You kept attacking, you drove forward, you didn’t run away, so you did a good job. Now think about getting more judo into there and you’ll be golden (y)."
judo,fkbpo0q,t1_fkbbhc6,1584037471.0,"The tsurite and hikite actions should occur at the same time. However Tsurikomi is more than that. It’s using your whole body to generate power. Have you ever had somebody tell you to think of your arms as chains attached to your body? It’s a common thing said to students to help them relax their arms. This is related to Tsurikomi. When you go into create kuzushi for a throw, you start generating power from your legs and hips. Then your arms simply follow the motion. This is Tsurikomi (as I understand it). For a good example, imagine you have your grips on uke and they are crouched on the floor. If you tried to pull them up to throw them, would you use only your arms? No. Because they would feel too heavy. Instead you bend your legs and use that power generation to lift them up. You can try it out and feel the difference. Just remember that your arms are chains attached to your body. Your lower body makes the power and your arms follow. 

I think that the reason you’re thinking of hikite and tsurite actions as being performed separately is because you’re forgetting about the 3 key points for all throws: kuzushi, tsukuri, kake. Kuzushi is breaking the balance, tsukuri is positioning your body to throw, and then kake is finishing the throw.

For clarity we could look at something like morote seoi nage (mostly because it’s easy to visualize). The kuzushi of this throw is a Tsurikomi action. You bend your knees and make a wave with your lower body to generate power. Your hikite and tsurite follow this motion simultaneously. Hikite pulls up and rotates. Tsurite lifts upwards and forwards. My sensei describes this as “the monkey” position lol. The tsukuri is turning in for the seoi nage. At this point your hikite hand is still holding the pull forward so uke remains off-balanced, but tsurite has rotated and turned inwards to lock uke into place. Your legs are bent and you are ready to throw. Kake is finishing the throw by continuing the turn and rotating your body and arms as uke comes over you. Lots of little details I skimmed over in here, but essentially you rotate towards the 45 so uke doesn’t go straight over you and onto their head. 

Now we can apply this to Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi (on the hikite side). Kuzushi is the Tsurikomi action once more. Tsukuri is a bit different, as this time we step forward and to the side while maintaining the hikite pull and the tsurite push (driving the bus), and propping uke’s ankle with the sole of our foot. As we step to the side uke’s weight is going to start shifting to the front foot we are pulling them onto. We want kake to occur when that shift isn’t quite complete. So as their weight shifts forward, we drive the bus to rotate them over. 

The important thing to remember is that these actions occur continuously. They’re not really broken up as the throw is performed. If you want to see a nice example of somebody using these concepts for their sasae, /u/beyondgrappling has a [good video on it](https://youtu.be/_2kekdm02SM). 

I hope this helps. I’m out injured so I have lots of time to research and talk about judo right now (y)."
judo,fk8ulf6,t3_fh3njf,1583963206.0,"Left-sided Hiza Guruma is just a hiza guruma. The mechanics of the two throws are quite similar, but if you want to go into semantics just look at their names. 

Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi -
Supporting foot lifting/pulling throw. The most important part is the lifting/pulling for sasae. You lift/pull uke with your hikite/tsurite (this is Tsurikomi) then prop your foot against their ankle (sasae). 

Hiza Guruma -
Knee wheel. You pivot uke (wheel or Guruma) around a fixed point to throw them (the knee). 

So you’re right. There are differences between the two throws. The most obvious is the foot placement. However the key point is how you’re throwing uke. If you’re just whipping them around you, then it’s more like a hiza guruma (even if your foot contact is around the ankle). However, if you’re throwing uke by propping their supporting  foot as they shift their weight onto it you’re doing more of a sasae tsurikomi ashi (even if you’re contacting higher up the leg). 

Since Hiza Guruma and Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi look so similar in videos, try looking at the actions of Sasae versus something like Ashi Guruma. It’s kind of like Hiza Guruma in the other direction (so you use the outside of your leg rather than the sole of your foot). Maybe it will help you better see the mechanics."

I’m a small female, too. My goal is to always have a battle plan. If they’re stronger, I don’t try and outmuscle them. Instead I try to be faster, more technical, and just try and pick out techniques that work better for the matchup. 

My husband tells me to have a “growth mindset” when I get frustrated lol. You can’t get better without practicing. So focus on how you can improve, and make baby steps towards it. We all have egos when we’ve been training awhile, but sometimes it’s important to try and drop them and just train."

judo,fjfzy27,t1_fjfxe0p,1583305736.0,"Yes. The learning curve is a bit steeper, but once you get into it, it’s a ton of fun! My recommendation to you is to focus on relaxing. It’s really hard to do judo when you’re tense and trying to use power (especially when you’re learning). Relax your grips, relax your body, and try to stand up straighter, rather than sinking down low into a wrestler’s stance. Don’t try and force anything. If it feels difficult, or your partner feels heavy, you’re probably doing something wrong (a nice throw should feel effortless). But mostly, don’t stress too much. Have fun, take the fall when the throw is good. Good luck!"

judo,fj94o1i,t1_fj5bgxz,1583132032.0,"Learning to do standing seois forces you to focus on key points of the technique, specifically kuzushi. If you can learn the timing and kuzushi to get a standing seoi, it’ll only make your drop stronger. 

Also, this is seoi otoshi, not seoi nage, so you’re not even practicing core seoi principles. If you’re gonna do drop, I would recommend towards a true drop seoi nage, where you lock, lift, and pop uke over. Safer for falling, and is just nicer judo imho. I would never do a drop on a white belt. First, because I don’t trust them to take the fall properly, second because they shouldn’t be doing drop seoi yet themselves, and third because it’s kinda lazy. When you’re with a lower belt, focus on challenging techniques. White belts are super useful for practicing ashiwaza on (or tougher techniques like standing seois)."

Does your association have standards for kyu grades that you will be using, or are you adjusting/implementing your own? Judo Canada has recommendations for each grade, but I’ve been working on my own curriculum that kind of expands on it and switches a few things around. I want a curriculum that’s a bit more organic (it’s hard to teach to a varied class when techniques are restricted per belt). Ideal situation would be having different classes for beginner, intermediate, advanced classes, but obviously wouldn’t have the demand for that at first. 

We’re around Vancouver, so sounds like you’re close to us! Definitely let us know! We’re always looking for dojo connections and training partners."

Would you still do a “test”, or just go off what you’ve seen in class? I think tests are a nice way to demonstrate your progress, but don’t think they need to be anything scary or something that people would really fail (especially if you’ve recommended them for it after watching them in class). Imho, I’d only let people test if I knew they would pass.

Thank you so much!"
