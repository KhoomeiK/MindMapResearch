The truth is that it takes time.  You just have to learn things as they come up.  Life is 85% suffering.. for me at least.  You never learn everything you want cuz you spend 2/3 of your life doing not what you want (work/sleep).  The rest of the time you have you spend trying to survive.  I sat down and broke everything into categories.  The emphasis, or goal was to maintain independence.  You have finances, health, relationships, transportation, housing, food, career; all these different things you have to worry about.  Do this yourself... stay organized.  Make a budget and stick to it.  Schedule your time wisely. Learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Accept the fact that life is a cruel joke and it's not really yours.  Be thankful that you're alive by spend what little free time you have enjoying whatever brings you the most joy.  That's what I've learned in my journeys so far.  Hopefully that helps in some way.  Good luck"

Its different for everyone and is on a scale of severity if that makes sense.  You can have a light mixed episode and a heavy ass depressed episode followed by normal for 2 weeks.  I still haven't figured mine out completely after a year of honest effort.  If you think you have bipolar you'll go in there and tell them you think you're bipolar and they'll diagnose you bipolar; that's just how it works. Your diagnosis is 100% based on what you tell them."
