Dalhousie,fpw5qkv,t3_gfdduk,1588957724.0,"Hi - I'm one of the people that was with Jad that night. I have to say, this whole story just doesn't seem to make sense even logistically. (EDIT: Jad's gf wasn't there ALL night, but for a lot of it - point is that Jad was around our group of friends, we were all around) I was with them for lots of the night, the only time when I wasn't in the same area as Jad was when I actually was in his ROOM. The door to his room was open, as were the doors of everybody else's bedrooms. I could see into them, I could see pretty much everything going on. And all I witnessed was people going pee and the occasional puff of a vape.

Aside from that, I also just know Jad very well. I have been friends with him for years. I've been drunk around him, I've stayed over at his house. I've helped him clean up after parties. I have never, ever, seen him behave less than polite and respectful. He has never made an advance on me, and has always just been a good friend. Before the self-isolation protocol kicked in, I can remember sitting with him at Coburg Coffee and essentially crying to him about some personal things I was dealing with. He bought me a latte, cheered me up, and wrote down any ideas I had to make the DSU better.

So yeah, accusations from a person who has no existing social media accounts about a night that I observed from start to finish, doesn't seem to make much sense to me."

Dalhousie,fp4jieh,t3_gb0hk0,1588300423.0,"I was at Jad‚Äôs the whole night of the accusation man. This sounds like it‚Äôs impossible it could have actually happened from knowing the house and being pretty lucid. I sat in Jad‚Äôs room with my friend for several hours, there‚Äôs visibility from there to all other rooms and all of the doors were open. Jad was with his girlfriend every time that I saw him there, and I was there for a very long time. The downstairs is all open, couldn‚Äôt have happened there. A lot of the signatures on the petition are fake and none of this seems plausible to me. My two cents."
