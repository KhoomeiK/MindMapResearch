A depression on the other hand, results from financial crises, stock market crash, or bank failures. These things don't usually happen during a recession. An economic depression is like a recession that lasts waaaaayyyy too long. So you have to stimulate the economy during a recession to avoid a depression.

There have been 33 recessions since 1854, and only one depression, the great depression. So does a depression always follow a recession? No. You don't want it to. So people have to return to work very soon if we don't want to enter a depression which is extremely hard to get out of and produces devastating effects to the country.

And the people losing their jobs aren't entering another job with no experience. They had a job before this lockdown so they're not going back into the workplace with no skills to offer."
