* A Japanese flu drug called favipiravir has been deemed ‘clearly  effective’ in treating coronavirus. Patients who were positive for  Covid-19 were given the medicine in China and tested negative for the  disease after a median of four days. For those treated with the drug,  lung conditions improved in 91 per cent of patients, compared to 62 per  cent of those without the drug.
* The British Red Cross has seen 10,000 people sign up to volunteer to  help others in the last week. The community reserves are currently  providing doorstep support – dropping off milk, delivering food parcels,  delivering the daily paper – and this is set to expand in the coming  days.
* Venice canals, usually bogged down with tourists in gondolas and  motorboats are now crystal clear. Those who venture out into the city  and peer down into the water may even see little silver fish swimming  around.  
* Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed a new  coronavirus test that provides results in just 30 minutes – three times  quicker than the current fastest testing methods. The equipment is  relatively simple and researchers say it could help detect coronavirus  in the earlier stages of infection too.
* Chelsea Football Club is making their Millennium Hotel at Stamford  Bridge available to NHS staff, to support those working long shifts who  may not be able to travel home. The club’s owner Roman Abramovich is  covering the costs of providing the accommodation.
* The locked-down French followed in the Spaniards' footsteps last  night, taking to their windows and balconies to cheer for the health  workers at 8pm. The collective act of solidarity was first seen in Spain  earlier in the week, when citizens opened their windows to clap for  those working with coronavirus patients."

classicwow,feu0a7x,t3_eqef4e,1579381832.0,"Can anyone knowledgable about the EPGP loot system tell me can it can be interfered with by offices who control it - for instance could they add  small amounts of EP to themselves/other players without anyone in the guild knowing and delete from logs? 

There is some really fishy things happening in my guild whereby some people’s EP is going down days after a raid and other players EP being increased. These are subtle changes which make me somewhat suspicious."
