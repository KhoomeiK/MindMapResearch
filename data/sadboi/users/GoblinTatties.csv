Psoriasis,fr6001z,t1_fr5t1xt,1589917523.0,"20 years later??? I say this with love my dude, I would see a therapist. Addiction of anything usually starts in adolescence because it's the time you're meant to learn how to reach out to friends in tough times and addiction is a way of avoiding dealing with emotions. And if you lean into an addiction at that time, you skip out on really important life skills & lessons and are literally forging the same neurological connections over and over again that make it harder to break the habit. Psoriasis is also really commonly triggered by stress. 

So you could make that extra assumption that stress and addiction being linked could be triggering your flare ups. Imagine if that is what your body is trying to tell you! Literally putting scales on your peen because of your addiction. We still dont understand how it all works, we don't even understand reality, so it's not a huge leap to think maybe that's what's happening.

Another friend of mine figured out his wrist pain was coming from bottling up his emotions. I cant explain it but as soon as he started letting himself feel his emotions his pain went away. Mad."
Psoriasis,fr5sdpw,t3_gmrlu0,1589913861.0,"It's an interesting (yet gross😂) thing to think about. Everyone has different triggers and as we still dont really know what causes psoriasis, there are theories that it's a reaction of some kind of imbalance (usually internally...) Much like how a friend of mine was addicted to milk and drank it so much he became allergic.

I would use this as at least a catalyst to address your porn addiction bc it can end up as a huge problem in relationships and being intimate with others etc.

Also the constant wetting/drying of ya peen would increase inflammation. Keep that boy moisturised."

AskWomen,fpmx8d1,t3_ge1tsm,1588744117.0,"Over winter my life was massively shifting, I had let go of my ""best friend"", a relationship and my parents - who had been emotionally abusive at a time I was physically and mentally sick.

Somehow, letting go of all the people closest to me opened me up in a way I havent before. I was able to give the love I needed to myself because I stopped trying to get it from other people.

A friend I met in thailand three years before was also going through a really rough time and an illness. I hadn't seen him since but we talked openly about our problems and it turned out that flights to where he was were incredibly cheap. I didnt have much money but I wanted to be there for someone like I'd wished someone had been there for me.

I'd always felt he was the most emotionally honest person I'd ever met. He was also insanely hot and just oozed wholesomeness and excitement. But I'd kinda forgotten about the hot part. Honestly!

Although he was getting more sick each day when I visited (and eventually flew back to his home, he was studying abroad) there was definitely something between us. We sat outside a cafe by a fire and he rested his hand on my knee and his head on my shoulder. 

It was obvious he wanted me to hold his hand and my heart was HAMMERING in my chest like it was trying to fucking break out of there. I argued with myself mentally for so long but knew I had to do it. I did, and he locked his fingers with mine.

I thought I was going to explode. When I was with him and listening to him talk, there was a warm euphoria all over my skin and deep inside my body. When he played his guitar I could FEEL IT like I wasnt a person but just a vibration like a fucking cosmic nebula of euphoria.

The only other time I have felt like this is when I was on MDMA. I did not know my body could do this by itself.

I knew I had to tell him my feelings. Thing is, he had been in a LDR since before I first met him. He had made comments about being unhappy but I'm not one to pry. I also knew that he was vulnerable because he was sick and didnt want to put any pressure on him. But fuck, I couldn't ignore these feelings.

Because of all the shit I'd been through recently, I knew I could handle anything. I had been to the worst place (thought I was going to die) and I had been there completely alone and found I could be there for myself. I was not afraid of being rejected anymore and I had to honour this feeling. 

So I told him. Told him I'd never felt this way before and that he's the most beautiful person I'd ever met. He said that was such a compliment but he felt intimidated by my feelings (dude, so was i) and he said he's always afraid to make a move, said he'd regret not kissing me after I'd left. So I asked to kiss him.

I could see how conflicted he was. And I was going to be ok whatever happened, but there was SO MUCH feeling inside me that my heart was searing with pain and it just boiled all the way up my neck until tears started falling out and all I could do was try to endure it.

He held me and helped to ease the pain. I went to the mountains for the rest of my time because things became too tense and I couldn't tell if he was uncomfortable. I kept asking if it was ok for me to be there and he said yes. I couldn't contain this shit though I needed to go somewhere, do something.

He called to say he was flying home that day and I asked if he wanted me to see him off and he said ""that would be cute."" So I rushed to get the next train back and say goodbye. 

We hugged for a long time but he never kissed me. He showed me affection in lots of ways and hinted at things and it was a kind of hell trying to figure out if these were just friendly gestures from a very loving person. But I knew that's not all they were, even if he didnt exactly feel the same way.

Since then I asked him to clarify his feelings and he is back and ""happy"" with his girlfriend and had been avoiding my messages. I asked him why he acted the way he did, because it seems he flirts with and uses affection from other girls while his gf isn't there. I needed to know the motives of the guy I'd considered to be ""the most emotionally honest person I'd ever met.""

And he did the thing men do. Completely denied any actions on his part, accused me of being ""disrespectful"" using my own wording and argument in a twisted way to make me seem like a bad person etc. That was all I needed to know. He was a liar. I said okay and deleted our chat history and decided to move on. 

I dont regret any of it. It was an incredible experience to feel like that. And those feelings came from inside me. I dont know if I'll meet anyone else who I'll respond to like that but the only constant in life is change. And I dont try to cling to anything anymore. 

It was not and is not the time for a relationship, not that I ever wanted that from him I just wanted to explore my feelings (and him...) and has just reignited my need for adventure."
socialskills,fpjqn06,t3_gds7pe,1588678082.0,"The therapy is a great idea. Being introspective is a wonderful tool, if you can work out why you have these barriers that will help you overcome them. Reflect, meditate and learn.

I have been a similar way for a long time, and then I started opening up more and more but due to my own trauma this made me emotionally dependent on and insecure with the people I was opening up with. And when they turned out to be unhelpful or not understanding it hurt a lot and I have lost a few friendships. But I have grown so much because of it.

I have since learned ""strong vulnerability"" (look up what you can about this) because I have learned to not fear the consequences of being open and being myself with others. I fell HARD for a guy and told my feelings for him without fear of rejection because I learned how to be there for myself and not fear pain. I never would have done this before. And it didn't go well but I am absolutely fine. That's life.

This has been huge for me because I have spent the majority of my life struggling with depression, and I have been learning how to love myself, and that's the crux of everything really.

Do not fear your feelings or other peoples reactions. Be there for yourself and love yourself. You've got one life, theres literally no point holding back or worrying about anything."

I drove away and didn't stop until I found an area that really felt right (a little mountain village) I lived in a hostel for 3 months and after a little while to process what happened, I realised I would never feel as shitty as I had done then and was prepared to do anything to not return home. Because I let go of them, I let go of the desire that they would change and be there for me and suddenly was able to give myself the love I needed. I also left a toxic friend behind and let go of my hang ups with an old relationship.

Damnthatsinteresting,fe4qruc,t1_fe4k2j1,1578861932.0,"Uhh yes they are - the conditions that have enabled the fires to become so catastrophic are caused by climate change.

A study of Queensland’s historic 2018 bushfire season found the extreme temperatures that coincided with the fires were four times more likely because of human-caused climate change.

“Human-caused climate change has resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia.

“Observations show a trend towards more dangerous conditions during summer and an earlier start to the fire season, particularly in parts of southern and eastern Australia.

“These trends are very likely to increase into the future, with climate models showing more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires throughout Australia due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.”

What about the future?

Climate studies show that conditions in Australia for extreme bushfires will only get worse as more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere.

Damnthatsinteresting,fe3qso5,t3_enmv5v,1578851987.0,"Reading the headlines and the incomprehensible numbers of dead animals since the fires started just couldn't compute in my brain. I dont think I was strong enough to let myself fully think about and understand the damage. I've been too afraid to let the reality sink in, too susceptible to depression to allow myself to attempt to process it. Because what conclusion is there other than depression? How else can one person react honestly to the reality of what's happening??

But this? I'm crying my eyes out right now. This is the saddest thing I've ever seen. A few seconds in and that was it. 

That koalas whole fucking world has burned down, he/she has nothing left and nothing left to give. And we have caused this. It's our fault. And it's just going to get worse."

depression,fddhpc9,t3_ekqsl7,1578312739.0,"I had a tough time at university. There is usually always some kind of counsellor/therapist at the university. I would definitely recommend going to see them about your feeling of loneliness, lack of self worth and so on. Therapy was the best thing I ever did, but some therapists do suck so it doesn't always help.

Something that often brings me back out of my shell is going places where I dont know anybody. The change of scenery and interactions without expectation help me to relax socially. Like taking a book/journal to a pub or doing work at a cafe. Shake up your environment where you can, go for walks in nature, take a day trip/weekend to somewhere new and try to look out more. Taking in my environment brings me out of my own head."
