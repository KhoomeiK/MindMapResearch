I left with about 25k in CC debt and it's been hounding me for five years.  I was never able to get much of a handle on it because the interest accrued pretty much matched the amount I could pay per month.  I finally did something that people say you should never do.  I had a decent amount of TSP (retirement) savings from my time in the military before grad school.  I withdrew 15k from my retirement account, put in a massive payment.  That was a few months ago.  Now, with my tax refund, coronovairus money, and bonus, I'm down to about 2k of CC debt and will pay it off next month.  I've never felt better.  Obviously the best thing to do would have been to not live outside of my means and go into the debt in the first place.  But, I'm so happy that I just pulled the trigger on pulling out retirement money out.  The peace of mind I feel now is just incredible.  I feel like I can actually start saving and making smart money moves that I was never able to do while I still had CC debt."

When she took one of the avocado and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.
