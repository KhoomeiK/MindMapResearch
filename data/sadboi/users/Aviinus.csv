Maybe they would have them on a device downloaded, so you wouldn't need internet, but anyway you gotta make sure that thay have a device to display them on, which may be problematic, especially in poorer cities. 

Also, the more technology you're using, the higher the risk that if smth will break, you won't be able to do anything, since everything will be electronic. 

It would definitely be a good thing, although (at least right now) it may be too problematic/expensive (and actually quite controversial) to make it true. 

Hopefully in the future though."

He doesn't really like the sea or sightseeing etc so he stayed home, while we went to the beach. Somewhere near was a place with roasted chicken, so when he got hungry he was supposed to buy some, bring home and eat. And so he did.
When we got back from the beach, my parent saw that theres barely anything left from the chicken and my dad sneaked out to buy more. Then we all sat to dinner and my mom asked my brother, whether he ate the chicken. He said he did. 
Mom: but theres still the whole chicken left
Brother: but I ate it
M: how could you eat it if it's still here?
B: what?
M: theres still the whole chicken left.
B: but... how? You know, I was reading a very interesting book. Maybe I was so absorbed by it, that I forgot that I didn't eat it. 
[My parents try not to burst out laughing. I dont get wth is going on]
M: sit and eat with us, then. 
So he did. He was really thinking hard while doing eat, but after all he ate a whole another portion. 
After that my parents told them that dad just bought a second chicken.
