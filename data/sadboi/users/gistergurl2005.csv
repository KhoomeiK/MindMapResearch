TrueOffMyChest,focwdqf,t1_fobjzw6,1587676755.0,SHE is the loser. She is clearly damaged in some way to feel the need to cheat. Things will get better doll. Find one positive a day and hold onto it. It will help you get from one day to the next.
TrueOffMyChest,fo3i5in,t1_fo3hyr2,1587487302.0,Don‚Äôt come at me with your sound logic!!!! I want to be a bratty entitled whiner!!! ü§£
TrueOffMyChest,fo3hd9o,t1_fo3frnv,1587486929.0,"There are other options out there and I‚Äôm not saying they have to stop using them, I‚Äôm saying maybe they could offer an alternative. For instance, for every 5 that contain peanuts give one that doesn‚Äôt."
TrueOffMyChest,fo3g1ta,t1_fo3fyq2,1587486287.0,That‚Äôs fine. Almonds only give me hives which I can live with. Peanuts are the dangerous ones for me.
TrueOffMyChest,fnr0trl,t1_fnr0hoy,1587176584.0,Honestly I don‚Äôt think it would work... I have seen my future with my Husband‚Äôs grandmother... there is no avoiding this frustration.

Connecticut,fn7lgyl,t1_fn7kiem,1586722698.0,That is true of SBC when it still existed. Local has pretty good food. But I agree with you.
Connecticut,fn3jzta,t1_fn3di39,1586622278.0,Local makes good food. SBC started out good but if you had it too many times you realize it sucked.
Connecticut,fn13e9g,t1_fn0dibe,1586553992.0,Having worked for him in the past... he‚Äôs a shit boss. But the food at his places tends to be really good.
TrueOffMyChest,fmzyu7h,t1_fmzvcw0,1586532265.0,The other thing is that Biden could very well put him on the cabinet and that would be awesome. Anyone anti Trump needs to be #BlueNoMatterWho

TrueOffMyChest,fkbs6d7,t1_fk9ud24,1584038836.0,"Totally there with you. I have immune-compromised family members, parents over 65 and a 3 month old. My husband and I are still climbing out of the hold my unpaid maternity leave put us in... I‚Äôm terrified of not bringing in a paycheck, more so than getting infected.. this is so frustrating, sad and terrifying. Add to that the fact that the government seems to be taking measures but too late... it‚Äôs a snow ball."
TrueOffMyChest,fjll2c9,t3_fdzhhi,1583448721.0,I want to address this to my father. I‚Äôd have to add in that I just had a baby tho.

bipolar,fi1d6i7,t3_f5oas3,1582055392.0,It‚Äôs fantastic. I see a lot of my life in it and it‚Äôs helpful. Keep it up. And we all come down eventually. I will keep my fingers crossed for you‚Äôd not to be a crash.

AmItheAsshole,fhkozgc,t1_fhjneto,1581688459.0,"Okay so the original comment was removed, this has turned into a debate on BC which has nothing, whatsoever to do with the OP and I can‚Äôt see anyone commenting about whether this guy or the neighbor was the a-hole. I‚Äôm gonna say both are TA. The neighbor should have minded his own GD business but you didn‚Äôt need to sink to his level. And ya I get it was early and you‚Äôre embarrassed by the situation. I don‚Äôt think you need to be tho. I lived at home, on and off until I was 32. The important thing is you keep making a go of it which shows determination and incredible courage. Screw that guy. He knows nothing."
bipolar,fh9ol06,t1_fh8hem6,1581386065.0,I am so sorry for your loss. Keep going. Your heart is beautiful just like your art.

AmItheAsshole,fg5aeoz,t1_fg4fom4,1580522345.0,"NTA 100%. I have a two month old and am doing almost the same thing. No one is allowed to come in unless one of us answers the door. Even if they have a key. That‚Äôs a rule we imposed from the get go, also, we need to know when they are on the way over so we can be prepared. Your house, your kid, your body, your frickin rules. You did NOTHING wrong. They should apologize to YOU for invading your privacy."
