awwnverts,fr22nka,t3_gkdtoa,1589830104.0,Woah. This is so weird. Just saw your video on these guys yesterday and when I saw this post the first thing that came to my mind was how weird of coincidence it is. Great videos!! Arizona Bark will for sure be my next scorpion
totalwar,fqzh7ng,t3_glqhxz,1589767313.0,"Glad you enjoyed it but for me it's honestly made the game much, much less enjoyable. Instead of adapting to rising powers the entire time I'm thinking, ""Ok am I going to be ready for the (at least) triple threat coming in the next 100 rounds or so?"" Just beating High Elves as Nagarron or Vampire Coast is a bitch but that's fun IMO. Defeating them and knowing I need to fight the same three giant, more difficult enemies who have teamed up against me shortly after isn't fun. It's predictable, tedious and it's gotten so annoying that I cant look forward to any DLC until it's fixed. Until then it's just more DLC characters that will join the Ordertide or more irrelevant characters that will be killed off in the first 20 rounds."

MurderedByWords,fqg22za,t1_fqfwpdy,1589336333.0,"Exactly, it's proof that people will vote for a candidate out of fear, anger, and hatred no matter what century it is.

tarantulas,fq1oekj,t1_fq1m09w,1589047487.0,"Lol. I'm not here to argue about pros and cons of having legos in your cage. No expert or breeder that I know would ever say this is ok. Go on YouTube and search up the variety of tarantula collectors, you see any legos or barbies in their cages? No. This is my last comment about the situation cause if it wasnt for the pic I'd be 100% certain you were a troll. Animals want to feel like in a comfortable, natural environment with materials they've evolved to be around. Not hard, flat, children's toys with sharp edges. You might not see stress that well with tarantulas but it's there and it will kill them over time. Grow up kid. Everyone's first avoidable pet death hurts the hardest so hopefully it happens sooner than later so you don't feel inclined to put a Hot Wheels car track or a swimming pool with other of your poor pets."

tarantulas,fq1a7vb,t1_fq0h5dn,1589043720.0,"I mean, if I have to explain to you why filling your per enclosure with legos then it's too late. Everyone here has pointed it out and if you were to post this on any arachnid board online you'd get roasted even harder. But you've already decided you're the expert and everyone else is wrong so whatever. It's just further proof that not everyone should own pets and that many T owners have the wrong intentions when buying them as pets. They're not toys you add to your Lego creations, they're animals that can get stressed but there is so much wrong in your response and the many responses here it makes me think you're just using mental gymnastics to keep toys in your pet enclosure"

aww,fpvpvfu,t1_fpuiua9,1588949620.0,I just meant the cage. Like it had to be cleaned consistently! The bird themselves were totally fine
aww,fpurqtq,t1_fpugzcb,1588921497.0,Glad to hear that :) I've had all kinds of pets throughout my life. Many exotic and odd but a local bearded dragon is always my favorite. Nowadays I stick to my chameleon and my beardy and that's more than enough!
aww,fpufn08,t1_fpucuv7,1588911694.0,"Honestly, might be cliche but Bearded Dragons are amazing. They are easily to take care of, have a great personality and I have never met one that wasnt friendly to me. But they're also known for being really friendly towards their owners. I have a friend who has owned one for years and when she walks by the cage it'll follow her back and forth until she picks it up. They are like little scaly dogs"
aww,fpu9q5d,t1_fpu8fv6,1588907766.0,"Lizards range in difficulty immensely. Chameleons, from my experience, are some of the hardest pets to keep. A simple veiled chameleon is probably the easiest but they are just fragile creatures. You need to keep the heat and humidity perfect and also make sure you regularly clean the cage. You need to get a large cage because they need a lot of room and get pretty big. You'll need a live plant that you'll also have to maintain and that will need similar requirements as the chameleon. You can still do all of that and upper respiratory infections can still happen and are a bitch to get rid of. Had to spend close to 400 dollars to get rid of it in my Panther Chameleon. All of that and there's a good chance your chameleon will hate you too. They'll hiss, lunge and even bite you. If they do like you and let you hold them it's still not good because the stress of being held will most likely take time off their lives. They're basically fascinating, beautiful, money and time consuming showpieces for your place. There are numerous pet lizards out there that are much, much easier and will actually like you and let you hold them regularly."
aww,fpu7ntv,t1_fpu5x2u,1588906455.0,"Idk about hate but they are very loud, can be bitey, smell and need a lot of care. I had a friend who had a really well behaved parrot that everyone loved but the amount of time and effort needed for one is pretty intense from what I've seen. But hey, I have a pet chameleon so what am I complaining about? They're just a tough."
pokemongo,fpqd5c6,t1_fpq1u3i,1588820142.0,I live in downtown in a big city and there were like 6 raids for Darkrai and not a single one of the span of a few days had a single person. No one wants to use a pass for a raid that needs many people and you'll be lucky to find even 1
pokemongo,fpqcyou,t1_fpq8td3,1588820026.0,Yup. The first ever remote raid was fantastic. Got 7 people joining. Since then I have yet to find anyone else in harder raids.

AnimalsBeingJerks,fpmy85r,t1_fpmqw12,1588744849.0,I adopted a 3 year old dog and have spent close to a grand over multiple trainers to help him with his anxiety. With me he's the perfect dog but when others come close to me he gets defensive and barks. I bring friends over and take him to various daycares and he loves other people but he gets aggressive when people approach me. The options are stop paying for training or return him to the adoption center. I've adopted several dogs in my life and can tell you all of them had negative behavioral traits that were excruciating to remove. I just love that Reddit promotes adopting dogs but have 0 sympathy for those that struggle with training.

Only celebrity I had an interaction with and he was  wayyy too nice. Glad to see him again here!!!"
dankmemes,fox1cpc,t1_fox0cvy,1588131753.0,Well it's late here too. You bring up good points so let's just end it here. Have a good one.
dankmemes,fowyxdk,t1_fowy8m0,1588130177.0,"Yes it is worse, American kids ARE actually dying and it is a problem that should be talked about. It's a fact and I would love the average American to get so offended by those memes that they actually work for a change. The French have spent their entire badass existence destroyed by one choice that most countries would have made. It's objective false. And it might be 100% false, but my original point is that someone European or non-American probably didnt make this to spread the misinformation against Americans. It's BS! But if we fact checked the shit we see on this sub alone I'd be 100% confident that there's a ton of bullshit spread. The difference is that us Americans tend to be the ones who get riled up and pissed. Reddit is a majority American. So it's not America vs. The World here. It's most likely an American who found a dumb meme and shared it because they thought it was funny. I would just like to see this level of defense for all the misinformation spread on this site, not just when it's against white, male Americans"
dankmemes,fowy487,t1_fowxpyw,1588129669.0,This is a subreddit about memes. I see offensive shit on here all the time. Someone saying that a stupid meme is propaganda against Americans is no different than memes that most Chinese people eat bats which I have seen several times on Reddit and this sub
dankmemes,fowx7xh,t1_foww7l4,1588129108.0,"I've seen the America #1 meme everywhere. /r/Murica is huge. I've seen tons of memes showing americans as patriotic on this subreddit alone. The idea that the French are pussies is 100× more offensive towards the French than memes against american shootings. Shootings at school actually do happen here a ton compared to the countries. The French actually kicked ass in both WW1 and 2 and have been called pussies because they had to surrender after putting up a fantastic fight. But again, the defense for the French won't nearly be as intense against Americans. A joke is a joke. Mean spirited or not. This sub has said some terrible shit before and I dont remember a defense force being made."
dankmemes,fowvwll,t1_fowv4tf,1588128287.0,"Lmao. Dont know what else to say about this victimhood. You're just gonna downvote and cry anyways. If Americans jerk themselves off about being the most powerful country in the world they need thicker skin than this. I've made fun of all my European friends and it's only Americans who get riled up and defensive about jokes. Jesus, can you imagine being Chinese on Reddit and seeing a comment like this? Imagine someone from China coming on here and defending themselves. Downvoted to hell and told they're paid by the Chinese government to say what they're saying. But no! The meme propaganda against Americans is the real circlejerk lmao. Brits get told they have fucked up teeth, that French are pussies, that Russians and eastern Europeans are alcoholics all the time on Reddit, bet your ass you and most people pissed at this meme wouldn't argue against those. Especially on this subreddit that shit talks people constantly!"
dankmemes,fowut33,t1_fowu4ek,1588127614.0,"Buddy, it's spread by idiots who dont know better. Probably found it on Facebook and wanted to share it without fact checking. Jesus, I see bullshit ""facts"" spread all over the internet that have nothing to do with spreading false information, just people who dont get that the meme ""fact"" they found was probably made by an idiot who misunderstood what actually happened. The fact your read this image and thought ""holy shit this is propaganda spread to make us Americans look bad"" just continues to prove that is Americans really do like playing the victim card. The same way a high schooler thinks the group next him whispering are talking bad about him. Just insecurity. Every country gets made fun of. As an Italian American I've heard it all, you just gotta laugh or cringe and move on. If I whined every time someone made a mafia joke or imitated an Italian accent I could reach a whole new level of victimhood."
