Advice,fh02q00,t1_fh02j27,1581199914.0,yes you’re right those solutions only solve the worst case scenario however.
Advice,fh02j3h,t1_fh01ry3,1581199847.0,well it wasn’t a blood test but in school she volunteered to do blood work and because she ways appropriately 105 lb she wasn’t allowed to. i’m sure of blood tests i just know the school program refused to do it.
Advice,fh0221e,t1_fh01mip,1581199784.0,yes i see these but that doesn’t solve everything
Advice,fh01qnv,t1_fh01h0s,1581199718.0,it’s more of a possibility she thinks is likely and not a certainty. we both agree she should take one
Advice,fh0199o,t1_fh00o0f,1581199566.0,i knew that first one she just says that it’s likely she is because she misses them all the time and it runs in her fathers side of the family. yes i am using a condom. she can’t get a blood test because of how underweight she is. pregnancy test will have to do

questions,exsbw1h,t1_exsbqi4,1566539196.0,Yeah he always complains about my hair too. “It’s too long”. He also always says some things to try to make me feel like shit. Like my mom is a crackhead and he’ll shame me for it. I hate it but if I speak up he’ll say I’m disrespecting him and I’ll either get grounded or hit or both. It really sucks. I’m told he everyone I know to just move out whenever I can but I don’t wanna reply on something that happens in 3 years. I just wish there was something else that I could do.

The epiphany of the person who was my best friend and who I loved most trying to put a knife 6 inches into my tummy shocked me too much to fight back until adrenaline kicked in and it was life and death.
