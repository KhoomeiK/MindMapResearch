I know I’m an empath, and also These people tell me I’m a good listener and they just feel comfortable talking to me. Over time this has inspired me to become a therapist, basically just try to find a silver lining even though it sucks you’re burdened with these secrets, he must have trusted you a lot to tell you whatever he did and that was probably comforting to him.

I don’t do porn the shoots are mostly artistic nude or lingerie and it feels classy and empowering and when working with a professional photographer who loves photography and is focused on just getting good pictures it’s fun. I’ve only ever shot with one guy who was a little creepy but not super creepy and I just decide I wouldn’t work with him again. Overall though the photographers are professional and just want good shots they aren’t google eyed at my boobs or telling me how sexy I am. A good photography will give instruction and ask permission to move your body in any way to get you in the position they want you in. Nothing crazy I just mean they may want your elbow slightly left. I get to put on cute lingerie, I’ve done cool shots with seashells and crystals, I did a shoot with a cow skull covering my private and that was cool. I just feel confident and have fun while making anywhere from $75-$100 per hour, it’s great!"

In my experiences if employers know about your illness they will be hesitant to give you deserving raises or promotions. (arguably this is understandable but still sucks) adjusting your schedule to accommodate counseling and psychiatry appointments can be annoying depending on your job and how they schedule. I find it’s easiest to just have one day off during the week to fit in appointments instead of rushing from work to appt or appt to work. Mental illness affects my job in a variety of ways, mostly negative but I’m hoping once I finish school and attain the job I want, maybe it will have less of a negative impact on my work."

BipolarReddit,fojxzdo,t3_g7qljm,1587831655.0,"I’ve had PTSD and bipolar at the same time. I have gone through a lot of therapy and personal growth and am happy to say at this point in my life i feel as though I’ve recovered from ptsd. It is hard work but not at all impossible. You will have good days and bad days some days will be really bad. For me the anxiety that accompanies ptsd was harder to deal with than the symptoms that accompany bipolar, I recommend finding the right medication as that has helped me immensely. I was having at least one full blown panic attack every week for months and anti anxieties drastically decreased my anxiety and my panic attacks. I know rn therapy and medication may not be available but what has also helped me is recognizing my triggers and having a plan for what to do when you are triggered. I’m hoping you are safe and no longer threatened with abuse or anything else that has traumatized you. If that’s the case reiterate the fact that you are safe now, this is much easier said than done but with practice and persistence it will become much easier to believe and eventually those triggers won’t effect you the way they do now. The worst part about overcoming trauma is reliving it, which is necessary but since face to face therapy isn’t available rn maybe save that part of recovery for when you have access to a therapist you trust."
