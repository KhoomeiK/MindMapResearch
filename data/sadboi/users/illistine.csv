She had me start by searching YouTube for a 20-min body-scan. Just to help relax. My therapist is sneaky, though, as this is good practice for self-calming the wild thoughts, at times. Typically, I'd do it at night to relax for bed and it helped that pretty quickly. I also used it in the morning and later do one in the afternoon as well. Eventually, I moved up to practicing Meditation.

Its taken 10 months and I still can't ('properly') meditate or keep my mind focused on a meditation longer than 5 min. There are no shortcuts, here. It takes time. There is no 'easy' cure.

When doing the scan, your mind will 'drift'. This is normal.  The practice (exercising new neurons) is in returning to the scan, calmly. Just picking up at the new place on the body, not worrying about the areas missed, and paying attention to your body and how it feels, at that moment. (You can do the missed areas at the end of the scan, if you'd like)

Unfortunately, my dispensary wouldn't always have the strain I was used to and would have to start over, testing new strains and effects. Often dealing with real bad consequences.

Using marijuana is a functional maladaptive coping mechanism. Ultimately, I have come to the decision, which works for me and my issues, to only use as a 'last resort' or 'rescue'. It may take away the pain and help gt out of lizard brain/deal with the stressors, but I know it also gets in the way of the skills I have in place to do the work \*I\* needed to do, when building, exercising, and expanding them.

Currently,  I only use marijuana as a last-resort 'rescue'. When I do, I have to remind myself that for the next 4\~5 days (sometimes longer) after smoking, I'll need to push harder on my other skills, as my body and brain chemistry re-balances. Now I only allow myself to do so extremely sparingly. Yes, avoidance IS one (of many) coping mechanisms, doing so 24/7, is not.

The PTSD became more complicated with my now ex wife using these tactics as well as other tactics to manipulate and control me so she could feel safe and secure. 

&#x200B;

For her reason(s) she felt justified in incarcerating me for the crimes of others. Is her (and the OP's) behavior/cycle of abuse  maladaptive ? Yes, but it can also be called 'Mirroring'. If we abused (AND even the abusers who seek help) do not recognize and address this, within ourselves, it will continue.

I'm fighting my way through recovery, after getting help for the assault in college and 16 year assault on me. I have only been in therapy and counseling for 4.5 years. The last 9 months of which free from my abuser and I have finally started to Do therapy, instead of therapy doing me (damage control). I still have a long way to go, but I do catch myself occasionally thinking in the passive aggressive, manipulative ways she thought and acted, so I will be accepted. When I do, I have to stop, pull back, and mindfully reassess whats going on. I work to get out of the Lizard brain and into the wise mind, so logic can help me be, feel, and ACT safely with others. If I don't, I'll end up in another relationship that won't be healthy (for either partner). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are a few posts that seem to be cheering for this behavior. I really think those posters need to get out of their lizard minds and work more on their own true selves, so they do not keep repeating this behavior.  My ex would get more upset and would turn up the heat when I was acting unhappy. Do I want another relationship with a person that isn't happy with it/me? Does anyone? Getting out of therapy and being able to function does not mean the cycle of abuse has been broken. It just means the current cycle is ended. We all need to sue our skills to ensure we don't enter another/new one.
