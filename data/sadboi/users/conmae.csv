BPD,f1wcouu,t3_dax3wr,1569783109.0,"My therapist once talked to me about being “passively suicidal” where you’re constantly hoping it will happen, almost doing our of your way to make it to without conducting suicidal or suicidal idealisation. When I was younger I used to tell her I wished I get cancer and die or have a massive heart attack but it took a lot of learning before I could recognise those thoughts as my undiscovered suidical nature. For what it’s worth I’ve been living with BPD for years now and still act in all these ways I just more able to recognise a ‘willingness to die’ from an actual attempts my life. No shame in either of those things, they’re painful and feel traumatic regardless but living impulsively is a characteristic of BPD so find solitude in that you are not alone."
Sexconfessional,ewrt9zb,t1_ewrsywy,1565713279.0,Alright that's good to know! I hope it was enjoyable for both of you.
Sexconfessional,ewrslxz,t3_cprzhz,1565712855.0,"I once forgot I had my menstrual cup in and started having sec with my ex partner. When we got inside and started thrusting he said something was hurting him. I still didn't remember at that point and said it must just be my IUD (even though it had never happened before and if had it for ages). I ended up running to the bathroom to see what was going on and only realised at that point. I was too embarrassed to own up so I said he must have fucked me so hard he made my uterus swell up so he could feel my IUD more??? I guess in the end if you both don't care that's all that matters. 

Side note: are you cool with how he went ahead and pushed inside you even though you'd said you didn't want to have sex? Don't want to meddle but that sounds like there was no consent there. I hope that's not a pattern for him (or any man)."
sex,ewl2b9u,t3_cok739,1565502859.0,"I’m (24F) not sure what it is but my last three long term relationships with men have been like this too. They all did it during the honeymoon period and stopped once it got more serious. I used to get upset thinking it was me and there was something wrong with me but I’ve realised it’s really just that I’m a giver by nature and I guess they weren’t.

I was the same that I’d bring it up and they’d get upset by me asking. Unfortunately, if someone doesn’t like doing something there’s not much we can do about it. It’s a hard situation because of course you’d want things to be more equal but you don’t want to pressure people into doing things they’re not comfortable with. All I can recommend is keeping those lines of communication open and hopefully you can both find a situation you’re comfortable with. 

Good luck and I hope your pussy gets some well needed mouth loving soon x"

sex,eu4vzjd,t1_eu4gwvs,1563464445.0,"I get that. Speaking as a woman who’s given a bj or two, it can be really hard to do your best work if your maintaining eye contact the entire time. Especially if you’re deepthroating or getting face fucked. Closing your eyes stops stuff getting in them while you go to town, suck back and forth and concentrate on controlling your gag reflex. I love giving head and when I close my eyes I’m closing them to give my best work and also so I can enjoy it myself. I’m gonna look up and make eye contact for periods but more generally it’s while I’m focusing on the tip or teasing. 

My tips for the OP are start your BJ nice and slow where you can tease and lick around his penis try periods of eye contact here, while you’re moving your head around a lot so that your gaze can be seen moving from his dick while you use your hands to his eyes while you get him super eager and teased. Even stop and smile at him and throw him a comment like ‘I love teasing you’ ‘I cant wait to put this inside me’ ‘i get so wet sucking your dick’. This is gonna put him in a really good mood and it gives you some times to get back into giving him head, swapping periods of eye contact with whether your gaze is comfortable. Try to keep the pattern relatively consistent and equal in the time periods for each.   Otherwise, keep eye contact away from him right up until he’s about to come, stare at him right leading up to when he finished and especially when he does. If you’re feeling frisky pull out tell him to lock eyes with you and not break contact while he finished on your face or mouth. Another super simple thing to do could be to talk to him and say you want to work at the eye contact but you can do better work when your focus is where your comfortable. You’re welcome refer to some of the stuff I said above. We love sucking dick and we know how to do it to get the best results. I’m sure all he wants is a good blowjob, but ultimately you’ve got to feel comfortable to provide that."
alcoholism,ett7anp,t3_cd8jkj,1563167082.0,"I’m with you here. Being sober can be painful and when it comes to handling negative or hurtful emotions with out alcohol, after being reliant on it,  it certainly does feel like hell. I’m currently 2 months sober so still early days for me but I’ve been in ‘recovery’ from alcoholism for about two years. That’s included some strong sober periods followed by relapses, so it’s been a journey to say the least. I’m at a point now where the best thing I’ve done in terms of my recovery is to determine what my triggers are whether they be external (places, people, objects, activities or events) or internal triggers (emotions, increased stress, or thoughts). I’ve spent time on my own and in therapy formulating plans to minimise the risks associated with the triggers. The external triggers can be far easier to avoid or plan for than internal ones.

Practicing distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills (from Dialectical behavioural therapy) is the most effective way I’ve found to manage painful emotions during sobriety. I’ve never turned to AA and I don’t think it would work for me but going to group or individual DBT or CBT groups can be really helpful as a means of practicing skills that will help you understand, challenge, and tolerate emotions or thoughts. If the idea of professional therapy doesn’t appeal to you there’s even some good worksheets or modules you can find online if you search DBT/CBT. Have a look at the CCI website, there’s some helpful stuff on there. That’s just personally what’s worked for me.

Don’t be too hard on yourself, the journey to recovery is a roller coaster, lapses are normal and so are painful emotions, I hope you can work out a way to process them and good luck in the future. You’re certainly not alone.

Edit: here’s just one example of some of the stuff you can try to practice at home to deal with the pain [DBT worksheets](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Tolerating-Distress)"

alcoholism,etnm7b6,t3_ccfl86,1562991748.0,"This in no way has to be your reality. With hard work and persistence you’ll totally get there, it may not come easy but take it day by day and you’ll get there. 

Spend some time to work out exactly what triggered you to drink last night, then work out a list of all your possible triggers and how you can possibly avoid them or respond to them. When I decided I wanted to quit I wrote down every person, place, object, activity, event, emotion and thought that I associated with drinking and worked out a bunch of solutions to minimise the risk associated with each. Tangible triggers like places or objects are far easier to avoid than emotional ones, however practicing distress tolerance or other skills through DBT and CBT can be super helpful. There’s lots of info and free worksheets to get yourself familiar with either of these therapies that might help if you don’t want to go to proper therapy for whatever reason. However, if you’re serious about quitting drinking and are struggling to get there on your own having a professional involved will make a huge difference. 

Keep your chin up, lapses are part of the recovery process. This only has to be your reality if you let it."

BPD,etbq4o4,t3_cawpao,1562656516.0,"Very normal for BPD, I also think that it’s pretty normal for people to want or need attention from people, it’s just the BPD trait to associating lack of attention to lack of love or connection."
BPD,etbeisj,t3_caivsx,1562644423.0,"I understand how you feel. I feel a similar way sometimes. I have a certain person that I’ve essentially been giving my all to, in terms of being as nice and helpful as I can. This is partially because I really do just enjoy doing things for people and I want to help them in anyway I can. I also know in the back of my mind that I’ve hurt this person in the past and so know that in a way I’m just constantly trying to make up for things that I’ve done. It didn’t really occur to me as manipulative until they and I had a conversation where I said I felt unappreciated and wanted to feel a little more effort from them that they brought up I was being manipulative by using my ‘kindness’. I don’t know it that clears things up for you but as others have said, most human actions are transactional and it’s pretty normal to have expectations of what people’s reactions might be. I guess if it’s troubling you try to focus on the act of being kind itself how that makes you feel and acknowledge that regardless kindness is kindness whether or not you receive a reward or reaction from it. Try to disconnect from the obsessive over the result and don’t be so hard on yourself, you’re only human it’s normal to hope that your efforts are being acknowledged."
BPD,eswjhq3,t1_eswj8ll,1562315942.0,I think it was just a maturity thing plus the fact that I had a reputation for lying so people used to question me and I got teased a bit over it. Now that I’m older I still have a pretty bad habit of lying but not so much over trivial things.
BPD,eswj3u0,t1_eswiati,1562315766.0,I think my teachers used to say ‘that’s not true. Why did you lie about it?’ And tell the all the standard stuff like it’s wrong to lie. I don’t remember then punishing me for it or telling me off really but I certainly did stop doing it to a degree by the time I was in high school.
BPD,eswhzbd,t1_eswhgmv,1562315276.0,I remember doing it from like 4 years old in kinder. When I was younger it was worse I’d just randomly swap details in stories or exaggerate a bit. I remember getting caught out a few times but it never made me stop I’d just continue with the lie like it was ridiculous they’d accuse me of lying.
BPD,eswh800,t1_esudm1k,1562314946.0,I’m actually not sure but I think it kinda stemmed from a self esteem thing and just this excessive need to be liked.
BPD,esrp2jp,t3_c8y1ik,1562232027.0,"Detaching from their FP is going to be extremely difficult. It’s almost as if that person becomes apart of them and all of their self worth revolves around that relationship. Because people with BPD also have issues with unstable identity it might help if they wrote a list of all the things they enjoy, their values, their goals, and strengths. Recognising that they have self worth and a completely separate identity outside of that person might help them to feel significant enough without that person. You yourself can help them by making them feel loved and appreciated. We crave connection so much and it’ll help if they can get that sense of stability from someone else. The best way to break away from a toxic relationship is to go completely no contact. Otherwise they’re just going to get them self into a continuous loop of trying to win them back again. It’ll be very difficult, but recognising that the relationship is abusive and detrimental is the first step. The key is going to be persistence and patience. There’s no easy way to break away from your FP regardless how damaging the relationship is. 

My tips would be make sure Your friend has an identity and self worth outside of that relationship, and she can acknowledge that, she deserves better and she has other sources of love and connection, and she does not need that person anymore. Go no contact, delete numbers cut all ties and stay resilient. 

Best of luck to you both."
BPD,esrntqq,t3_c8xwnl,1562230827.0,"I’m very similar I’ve always lied about unimportant simple things for no reason. I used to make up stories or lie about very insignificant details just because I could and I noticed myself doing it but never knew why and wasn’t particularly bothered by it. As I’ve gotten older I’ve definitely gotten better and catch myself out when I do it and make an active effort not to. That being said I also lie about important things to people I care about either out of shame, guilt or manipulation. All of the people that are close to me are aware that I do it so I basically no trust from any of them at this point. 

After a lot of thought I started to think that maybe I lied about insignificant stuff to make myself seem more exciting or fun. I guess in the end it all comes down to wanting to be liked or admired by people. I definitely know I have a problem and most people would probably consider me a compulsive liar but it’s something I have accepted and am trying to change. Building trust back with my loved ones and FP is going to take a lot of work. But know that you’re not alone and it’s something that you can control and change. Acknowledging it is the first step anyway. Hope this helps."
sex,erja1y1,t3_c28re9,1560920738.0,"I don’t think you necessarily have to reveal you’ve been faking orgasms to your partner, if you know what they need to do to get you off maybe try suggesting it to them (“ oh I love it so much when you ...” or “it feels so good when...”) or take it into your own hands and show them when you guys are getting busy. 

It’s something I used to be so self conscious about to do I feel your pain here. I used to be really self conscious about my orgasm face but over time I realised there’s kind of nothing sexier than seeing your partner truly enjoy when you guys are doing, even if you’ve got to take it into your own hands. I think when it comes down to it they’ll probably think it’s a huge turn on regardless of how you move or sound or anything. Besides there’s no normal way for people to look while you orgasm, as people have said comparing yourself to porn is a recipe for disaster. Porn is great and all but it’s a movie, it’s very rarely realistic. It might take a while to get over feeling self conscious but in the long run it’s going to be sexier for you and your partner if you’re both authentically enjoying yourselves.

Edit- as other people have said your partner will probably be wrapped to see your orgasm, regardless how wild it is, if someone was thrashing around screaming and causing a huge ruckus, I’d be thinking.. fuck yeah we made that happen 🙌🏼"

BPD,epkdaay,t3_buxano,1559272562.0,"This is 100% a BPD thing. Sounds pretty much like splitting and it’s probably caused by ‘black and white thinking’ and our patterns of adoration and demonisation. They either love us or they don’t, they’re always good to us or they’re never good to us, we either love them or we hate them. Everything works in absolutes, there’s never any grey areas or inbetweens. 

Someone who we see as the best person in the world; who we love and adore, can very quickly change into someone who’s 100% bad and hurtful. If you feel hurt, let down or you perceive abandonment or rejection from this person your BPD brain is probably trying to protect you by immediately casting them as someone you don’t love or care for anyway. As if to make the hurt, loss or rejection (whether it’s real or not) less hurtful to you. Think... “I don’t care that he hasn’t messaged me, I hate him anyway”, “I don’t care that he moved away, he’s nothing to me anyway” etc. 

Splitting sucks, and I for one, am certainly guilty of it. It’s something that’s very hard to control and even notice when it’s happening in the moment, but where you can try to remember that things are not always in black and white. If it helps, write a ‘pros and cons’ or ‘good and bad’ list of the good and bad things in your relationship, try to remember why you are together and that it’s normal for relationships to be hard sometimes. If you can try to remind yourself that your relationship is made of light and dark moments (hopefully the majority are light), it might be easier to process how you’re really feeling and even calmly express to your partner what you’re concerned about. 

Hope this helped a little bit and good luck moving forward. Stay strong 😊"
