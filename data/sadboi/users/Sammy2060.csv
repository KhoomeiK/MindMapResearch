Donâ€™t bully! Itâ€™s not funny and if u do, stop bullying, or u never know, ur victim could kill themselves. U might just brush it off at first, tho as u get older, uâ€™ll realise what uâ€™ve done and uâ€™ll have to live with the guilt that uâ€™ve caused that person to kill themselves. In fact, u might not be able to live with the guilt that uâ€™ve caused that person to kill someone and u might commit suicide because of it.

( if u understand what I mean )


To answer ur question, I go to bury church and if u bully me, my gf, my dad, my sister, my nephews and some other of my family, will get u kicked out of the school and my nephews will also hurt u if u bully me. And I can assure u that this will happen. 

If u think bullying is fun and funny, uâ€™d better think again! It isnâ€™t and never will be"
