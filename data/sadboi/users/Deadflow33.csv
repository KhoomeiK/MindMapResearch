iamatotalpieceofshit,eregmd0,t1_ere520g,1560783600.0,That’s absolutely terrible. I went through a similar experience. Rest In Peace to your sister. I hope that you never have to go through something like that ever again. :(
iamatotalpieceofshit,eregamh,t3_c1ew9x,1560783362.0,"This reminded me of one of the worst memories I have. People have always been extremely rude when it comes to my deceased brother(bullying, harassment, threats,etc). However, when I was visiting his grave one time—he’s in the child section of the cemetery so what happened is more shitty— we discovered that a person(if you could even call them that) had pissed inside of the vase of flowers. It was quite clearly urine and it was too much of the substance to be an animals. This was on my brother’s death day. I broke down bawling my eyes out. What kind of person is that heartless? And in a child’s grave? Terrible."

After you have, think of how strong you are for having the control to walk away. Be proud of yourself for that. I have one technique that always helps me. Try drawing lines or doodles in a red pen. You can do it on paper or one where you usually harm yourself. But PLEASE leave the room that has the object. If it means locking yourself in the bathroom to cry and curl up in a ball, do that. Just walk away and realize how strong you are. 💕💕💕I believe in you!!"

If you can’t get help from a celebrity, have you considered talking to a lesser-known therapist? Like from a small clinic. If you are worried about being judged, going on television might not be the best choice. Just search online or around friends that might be seeing someone and try to get recommendations.
