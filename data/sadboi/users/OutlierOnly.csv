BPD,fo3yhdr,t3_g5ksqf,1587495104.0,I don't know anything about you so I cannot confirm or deny any of those traits but I would say that try not to tell people about your bpd unless they know you well. A lot of people don't go the extra mile to be understanding so let them get to know you first and then maybe once you're comfortable let know about it. If they still feel it lines with those bad traits then maybe self reflection is in order. You are still an individual apart from your bpd and having it does not automatically make you a bad person.

BPD,fm312hg,t1_fm2xng9,1585710193.0,Well thanks for the conversation it was good talking to you since I feel you really do have a lot of the same issues. I hope this doesn't sound weird but if you ever want to talk about stuff like this again I'd be down to. It's difficult to find people (even here unfortunately) who I feel I relate to so I thought I might as well ask. If not that's fine too this was enjoyable enough to suffice.
BPD,fm2vr2y,t1_fm2u3gt,1585706539.0,"> eventually the friendship starts to take its toll bc resentment may  creep in & start to plague my positive thoughts about them/the  relationship  

I absolutely get that way too. I wish I had a way to mitigate it but you picked the perfect word with resentment. If feel myself start to split and devalue them I can work through it if I get at least ONE positive emotion/interaction from them but since they don't know anything is wrong they continue acting the same way which usually results in a break from them. It sucks to have to work through issues with people when they don't even know they did anything ""wrong"". Because in truth they didn't. (Doesn't stop my emotions from feeling like they did) They were just being themselves. Sorry if I'm being too chatty. I'm currently 2 months deep in a break from my friends for this exact subject so it helps to air it out a bit. Normally not this talkative..."
BPD,fm2ols4,t3_fso166,1585701875.0,"Fuck that is SUPER relatable. You worded it well don't worry. Thanks for the post I was starting to think it was more of a personal quirk.

 edit:  I think being like a ""social chameleon"" starts to take it's toll over a long period of time. I get tired of making the effort to be relatable,understanding,entertaining and essentially be the type of person that fits them individually and I feel like I lose what little part of me I consider myself. Due to this I tend to have a lot of people who feel super close to me but I don't feel THAT close to because I have to shift parts of me to fit them.  Which sucks because I think deep down I want that connection with people but I can't seem to let myself just be.  Sorry if it's a bit rambly."
BPD,flrmlci,t1_flqiej6,1585423327.0,Anytime! It's awful to have to deal with.
BPD,flqb8o8,t3_fqgai6,1585387140.0,Very relatable. I think for myself it's similar. I tend to let a lot of things that hurt me slide until it's built up to a point where I want nothing to do with the person and I completely split. I would assume the only way to avert that would be to address the issues when they come but I'm sure you know how hard that is. Especially depending on the person you are talking to since many people have ego issues and practically fight tooth and nail to defend it even when they are wrong. Dealing with that experience probably has shaped how I deal with people. Unfortunately the way I cope is to just completely disconnect from them which I know isn't healthy but at that point I really don't care for/about them so the only problem with it is the loneliness that comes afterwards. Not really the best coping mechanism and I don't recommend it.
BPD,flmmfdq,t1_flml8vt,1585288226.0,Np. Take care of yourself
BPD,flmkj5e,t3_fpq024,1585286409.0,"28M The only thing that can break through a mood swing that soured my day is a workout of some kind. Whether that be a decent length run or an actual workout. It mellows me out and usually shifts my disposition in a positive way. Everything else for me can only distract me for some small amount of time. I think releasing all of the pent up energy helps. Flip side though is that the increased energy from exercising on down days makes swings worse(at least for me) so it's kinda like a medicine you have to take constantly. I really get having one thing sour an entire day. Something as ""small"" as someone saying something that could be interpreted as rude. Just sharing what works for me it will obviously be different for everyone. Take care."
BPD,fkxp8qz,t3_flbkki,1584632761.0,"This may be different because I’m a quiet borderline and I can’t speak for everyone, but in my experiences it’s the opposite. I tend to shift the blame unto myself to mitigate other people’s bad or “triggering” tendencies. So I think it’s unfair to say that it’s just a BPD thing."
BPD,fkkhf4x,t1_fkkgxm9,1584284075.0,Agree wholeheartedly and I hate it.
BPD,fkkgae6,t3_fj1v3p,1584283306.0,"I know for me it's because of a deep sense that everything will always descend towards a worsened state. Which most people know deep down. ""Nothing lasts forever"" Unfortunately the pain that brings is so significant that it makes my mind obsessed with the idea. Because truthfully in life nothing will last forever and you are  just waiting for that thing to abandon you. In people with bpd I think because of that it becomes a matter of when instead of if. And then you become paranoid of the signs so you can disconnect in some way before it actually happens to mitigate the damage. That's just my speculation and it's down to everyone's individual interpretation."
BPD,fk96ozs,t1_fk94ox8,1583969826.0,"Ah I see. I was just wondering because the relationships I got into some had that feeling come on super early(after first intimacy) which was was super demoralizing. It left me wondering if I had given it more time it would go away. 

I share the same fear that I am incapable of feeling ""love"" towards anyone but at the same time crave it. The people in my life feel close to me but I just feel so disconnected from them. I do think it is BPD related though because as I try to trace my feelings on the subject they seem to stem from some deep seated sense of emptiness which is present in many other aspects of my life. An emptiness that is apparently very common in those with Bpd. Sorry if this wasn't particularly coherent I want to put it together better but I'm exhausted.

BPD,fk04vnq,t3_ffqk6k,1583741917.0,Quiet borderlines are typically the only ones I can relate to. It makes me feel isolated even from this community because of they’re anything like me they tend not to post for a myriad of reasons. I feel like I typically take self awareness too far. It just paralyzes me from doing so much. Being self conscious about being self conscious or seeming so makes something as simple as going to the store a nightmare to even think about. That all said on the outside I present completely normal and personable but on the inside I am completely at war with myself and my actions. It makes life not worthwhile.

BPD,f7fxv29,t1_f7fxfvp,1573689412.0,"I wish it were easier myself. There never seems to be a middle ground but finding coping mechanisms lets you keep that intense feeling without going completely nuclear. At least that's how I feel. I haven't got it down to a science but, I have managed to make it a little bit easier. I think we all want that FP relationship to work the way we feel it should instead of having to settle without it. For me personally any relationship that isn't that feels hollow."
BPD,f7f1x8v,t3_dvvusa,1573670643.0,I don't think much advice really helps but talking to people about them might help you feel less bad. I think most of us  struggle with it  to varying degrees.  For me it got a bit better with age but I really felt it intensely when I was in my teens. I know that might not be much solace but I hope even the chance can make it a little easier.
BPD,f7eetjv,t3_dvquar,1573655756.0,I don't know if stopping from becoming your FP is helpful. Ideally you would want to feel that level of comfort with someone. Is it possible to talk to him about your BPD? Maybe to help him acclimate to it. I think it's better in relationships if both people are fighting the right battle. Not just you fighting and them going about their business. Communication is key and I think deep down you want to feel that connection with someone. That's probably why the FP feelings are slowly coming back.
BPD,f7edz47,t3_dvsfue,1573655123.0,Very well said!

BPD,f7diq5q,t1_f7dg4yv,1573617956.0,"I have to say that response is a little eerie. Like exactly word for word how I have described myself to people. Honestly a little freaked out man. lol

edit: not in a bad way I just needed to say that this is probably the closest I have ever been to feeling like someone TRULY understands the way I feel on a deeper level. I usually avoid talking about it for for fear that it comes off as a humble brag when in reality it's just how I am. I am rather picky with my words as to not upset anyone. I think it was born of trying to avoid people's hurtful comments through ""manipulation"". I hate using that word for this but many people will see it as such. The way I see it is if I'm always this agreeable/funny/cheerful person then people wont subconsciously say hurtful things. It doesn't always work but it was my coping mechanism for being extra sensitive to wayward comments. If they weren't aware that what they were saying was hurtful then I could possibly sway them to a place where they wouldn't say such things. I'm sorry if that went to a bit of a ramble but i'm a bit tired and this is pretty exciting."
BPD,f7df42w,t3_dvlgnl,1573615115.0,Don't have a reason for why but I absolutely can relate to the obsession followed by dropping it for something else.
BPD,f7decwy,t3_dvl19m,1573614549.0,I resonate with a lot of what you have said here. I am a 28 year old male who feels like he doesn't fit in with any identity solidly. It causes a lot of loneliness and pain. And while they never faded  I feel as if it gives me a unique perspective on life. Almost like an ethereal entity gazing through the looking glass.  I also don't think that it makes you worthless. Nor unlovable. It just makes you different. The contradictions can give you unique perspectives that having a baseline identity might not. You aren't worthless!
BPD,f7dauw5,t3_dvkrmc,1573611994.0,Try not to let the idea of it becoming your identity cause you any stress. BPD unknowingly had influences in many major events in my life. Knowing it early can help you prepare yourself and future relationships from harm.  Your boyfriend could possibly read up on some techniques on being with someone with BPD. It could possibly help reduce stress in the relationship. While that doesn't help strangers it can make your life hopefully better where it matters. Average people can see a lot of the symptoms as someone just acting crazy so they wont change the way they interact. I think BPD causes more harm if you ignore it so don't feel ashamed to talk to those who mean something to you about what might hurt you.
BPD,f7d9uca,t3_dvkkii,1573611273.0,I find that exercise to a notable degree can really help manage thoughts. Maybe because it's because of the exhaustion or dopamine but it makes me feel more calm and less prone to the mess that BPD brings. I believe it's a helpful way to manage symptoms because it can pull you out of your head to concentrate on something physical. Also music really helps to release intense feelings in a controlled environment. Other than those I haven't found a truly efficient way to deal with the really REALLY powerful BPD symptoms. I'm sure that someone else has a therapist approved way to deal with it but this is the best I can provide. Best of luck to you!
BPD,f7d8cwz,t1_f7d72te,1573610222.0,"The trouble comes with trying to decide if you were in the wrong or if they were genuinely mean/bad.Sometimes it feels like both.  I think doubting your emotions can be a helpful in that it hopefully allows you some more time to process what is going on. As long as the doubt doesn't hurt you of course.  I feel that a break really help me collect thoughts and recharge. It can also make me appreciate those relationships  a bit more. Unfortunately that feeling doesn't last forever and it leads to more breaks but it at least helps me keep my head without destroying bonds that I made. It's a cycle. I'd also say that usually ""normal"" people are none the wiser to my absence ,especially if you make a habit of it. Although if you are really close just let them know that you need some time to become whole."

BPD,f7d4hlv,t3_dvjnb9,1573607386.0,"He was aware of the BPD right? I know you said he was talking like a victim but maybe he just had the heart to stick through the roughness. That is rare trait. Is there any chance that you want to remove him before he can remove you? Only reason I'm asking is because personally in relationships I've felt great remorse over ending things prematurely before I could mentally collect myself. Granted, you've had 2.5 years so that is much more time than I to think about it than I did. All I remember is that pieces of me were tugging in different directions to leave for different reasons. Some for fear of abandonment. Others for feeling like I was using them.  Both made me feel like a weak awful person. But in the end I turned those bad feelings against the relationship disregarding what the other person felt. A part of me resented them for even liking me.  I know it would be overstepping my boundaries as a random to ask that you try  to see them in a different light. Maybe as more than someone like a victim. People with BPD are deserving of love even if it takes more effort. That doesn't make you evil or him weak. Feeling bad about hurting our loved ones is a part of the battle. For us and for them. I hope you feel better. I am sorry if I was rude."
BPD,f7d2q07,t3_dvjft8,1573606081.0,"Try to hold on! Bpd can really put a powerful strain on your relationships. It has put major stress on my ties  to everyone I care(or so I say) about making me hate them for not being nicer or more understanding.  But sometimes it's just a demon making things out to be worse than they really are. I am not saying that is the case in your situation but please ,if not just for your own well being, maybe give it some time before cutting all major ties with them. A lot of people don't realize how much effort it takes to be a nice person when struggling with internal issues so maybe give that benefit of the doubt to your friend. I'm sorry if this sounded rude in any way I'm just trying to help."
BPD,f7cqva9,t3_dvh8zv,1573598053.0,HOLY shit! This post is almost exactly me. Right down to the ages. I wish I had some words of encouragement but I'm struggling to find fix my life too as well. Please don't give up man. I wanted my whole life to see someone who had my/similar struggles to succeed so that maybe I could have some hope. Try to stay strong. I understand that knowing someone else is going through it doesn't make it better just please know you aren't alone.
BPD,f7cp7an,t1_f7c7zui,1573597061.0,BIIIG time lurker here and I think that's a wonderful way of going about helping this community! Everything you mentioned is a big reason why I struggled for years to ever post.
BPD,f7coueb,t1_f7chcg6,1573596848.0,It's tough because we should really understand what it feels like but since everyone is also going through the same things it can leave us all with little to give. I would assume that many others are usually posting because they might be feeling particularly bad in that moment. I'm rather new to this community and want to help do my part because this seems to be the only place where people feel the same as I do.
BPD,f7bit41,t3_dvap7u,1573570008.0,I do. I tend to write out entire posts on many sites just to finish and ask myself what it would even accomplish so I end up deleting them. I guess in that moment it helps to release the thoughts in the head to something physical but it makes me anxious to have a post up and not have a response. Like a conversation where the other person is refusing to respond. It's part of what makes internet interactions feel so hollow imo. But i'm trying to work on it myself as evident of this post.
