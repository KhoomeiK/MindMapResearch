We've relied on them picking up the slack for the better part of the industrial revolution and as a result are more developed nations, maybe it's our turn to pick up the slack and repair some of the damage we've done to allow room for Brazil and other developing nations to catch up, because at the end of the day developed nations tend to have an easier time of contributing solutions of this nature than nations otherwise preoccupied with providing the citizenry with their basic human needs.
