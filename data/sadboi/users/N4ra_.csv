I've also been told by a few different professionals that it's likely I have adhd, but I've never been officially tested or diagnosed. One of my close friends has it and I relate to a lot of the struggles he had while he was off of medication.

I lost a relationship because of psychosis because I didn't know what was going on with me and so I couldn't explain it to him, and he couldn't understand it either. But yea I'm really grateful for my current friends, though I may only have a couple, for sticking with me through this. My dog helps a lot too.
