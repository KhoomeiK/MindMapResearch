I just shuffle through my hobbies without ever really getting engaged in them, I get social anxiety these days about going out when I never did before and the most relaxing thing I do is drink because it takes my mind away from bad thoughts and feelings. I also don’t have interest in my job anymore and I just feel like overall I’m just slowly fading away. Still I try to stay positive and keep it going because there isn’t much else I can do. My advice is to just find little things to keep you happy, whether it be watching YouTube videos, cooking, or just playing stupid cell phone games to make time pass. I think and hope eventually the feeling will pass and life will start to trend upwards."

And everybody laughs and parrots the same phrase again, ""nice"" ""nice"" ""nice"" If you imagine it, it looks like we're all in an insane asylum. In fact, that's really all we do here; just drive each other insane. We keep repeating the same shit over and over until one person finally snaps, and everybody agrees and moves onto something else. Then the whole fucking cycle repeats itself. We're all stuck in the Loony Bin and nobody can escape because we just keep feeding into each other's crippling mental illness.
