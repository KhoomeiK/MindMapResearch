John was so bad that he cursed people but Jesus accepted him. Now he dedicates his life to set people free from demonic curses and spreading the word. Your guilt isn’t a bad thing but you shouldn’t let it make you feel unworthy of Jesus. Read the word and repent out loud. I think talking to a priest would be good to help your conscience and for guidance but you can speak to god any time. But since you are catholic speaking to priest is necessary I am not so I have a different way of repenting. But yeah telling him everything would probably help you a lot.
