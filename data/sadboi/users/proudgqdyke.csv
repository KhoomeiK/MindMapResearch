She understands that she is almost 40 years old, and her parents are hitting up into the elderly category. She is frightened for her future. I went out of my way to get numbers for vocational rehab, social workers, a housing program that would include a support counselor, nutritionist, and other services so she could get out of her parents' house and into more independence, and even a good therapist that charges on a sliding scale. With her income, she'd be able to go for free twice a week. Does that sound like someone who doesn't care? She declined all those suggestions. So, that's on her.

Yes, it is best to part ways. I tried to be a good friend and help her. I don't think she's a bad person, just sorely in need of extensive help, which I tried to help her get. She decided she didn't want it, after asking for it. So, whatevs. You can think I'm a bad friend and bad person all you want. I know otherwise."

As for the weight issue - I am not making a MORAL judgement. I'm talking objective health. And it's not just her life, really, because morbidly obese people lose their mobility, forcing those around them to care for them. As someone with eating disorders, this is a sticking point for me, because being around someone with poor habits would not be good for me. At any rate, the point is moot.

1. She asked me for help. She asked how she might take care of herself because she knows that when her parents die or even get to the old age stage, there will be no one to care for her.

2. You're the only one in here defending a woman with obvious issues with regards to things like racism. If that is okay with you, and you think I should just take it, just say so. I disagree, and that's okay.

4.

And, yes, I think a 40 year old woman who is well on her way to ""My 600 LB Life"" territory,  uses her mental disorder to treat people like shit, and is a racist to boot without understanding that she is deserves some scrutiny.

I have already concluded that this person is toxic, at the very least, in her current state.

Also, her parents are the only people in her life, as she is agoraphobic, and even her best friend of many years ghosted her last year. She likely did not want to enable/watch the self destruction any longer, or endure those behaviors. Her mother coddles her, and her father is disabled from multiple strokes. They would not be any help. I already talked to the professor who introduced her, and he said he is not surprised that this is how she turned out, but he also said not to get my hopes up that she would change. He simply introduced us he thought maybe his predictions had been wrong. Nothing doing, though. He said I could motivate her, but she was stubborn.

I get the feeling the family does what she says because those rages are so scary (Imagine 5'3 me being yelled at by a 5'11, 400+ lb person for no reason. I imagine her parents avoid that at all costs). 

And yeah, I mean, I even gave her a grocery list to give to her mom to help with her weight, and told her to just get up and move around more, at her weight, she'd lose weight. She got defensive, said she's proud because she lost 60 lbs. a few years ago, but only because she was having trouble bathing herself, and I should be proud of her too.

Around that time a bunch of family got sick, etc. And we had lots of deaths later. And I'm having a ball at school. So, all's well that ends well. 

And yeah she's like a little kid."
blackladies,es1h5c0,t1_es0i9v4,1561496697.0,"that's why I put ""returning"" college student in there. I have a degree in computer networking, but fell and hurt my back and had to do things like learning to walk again, etc. That was a real setback. But I've been a functional adult like anyone else my whole adult life, save 3 brief months when I moved from NY back home to SC as I finished recovering and found a new apartment, etc. And even then, I paid rent and helped out and bought a new car and stuff as I looked for a place to live. It's why I have such little patience for her.

But you aren't being mean. She's a child in an adult's body. Even beyond that, to give you an idea, ANY questioning of her behavior is seen as ""judgement."" Like even when I asked her why she has to eat everything with a spoon like is typical of children in programs for autistic children, her response was, ""I'm feeling judged."" So, you get the picture. She won't even clean the house or anything. Period."
blackladies,erzzgwd,t3_c4piwk,1561459776.0,"I grew up in a weird family. I love my parents, of course, but a lot of stuff happened to me, including 7 years of sexual abuse at the hands of my dad's daughter from his first marriage. On top of that, my mom is really, really overly critical. She even said that the reason the abuse went on so long is because I was too cowardly to tell. She also thinks it's why I'm gay. She also says that keeping my mouth shut about a racist teacher in 4th grade was my fault. You get the picture. I know I'll never be good enough for her, so I stopped trying. I just do my own thing. I'm a returning college student, and I have a good network of friends and colleagues.

&#x200B;

I am also learning to set boundaries and not be a victim. This includes doing things like setting limits with folks with their own issues and shit. I'm not anyone's therapist, and they are not my project. This is my biggest struggle but I'm working on that."
blackladies,erzwspk,t1_erzgej5,1561455906.0,"Oh, I have no intention of being a therapist. It's more...as someone who knows what it is like to struggle with mental health issues, I try REALLY hard not to judge people in that direction. You never know what brought them to that place. But it is also not my job to help her. I don't do projects."

blackladies,erywm5v,t1_erywd4y,1561419424.0,"That's my thinking as well. And I say this as someone with bipolar disorder (but it is very well controlled through meds/therapy. You would not know unless you snooped my medicine cabinet or something).

I hate to judge. I know how hard it is. I am on a weight loss journey myself, and I've struggled up and down over the years. So, I get it on both fronts. But seriously, a 400 lb, 40 year old woman who makes her mom who works 12 hours per day get up to make her a sandwich in the middle of the night (she did this during a late night phone call once), who won't cook, clean, or do anything, and orders her mother around, makes her do things...there's something deeply wrong with that. This is especially true when any suggestion to change or at least try to get better is met with cries of ""judgement"" and ""I can't help it."""

Best of luck to you!"
