A few points to note that in the old days before chemical knowledge, up until around WWII, it was just a strange common belief (note common with variation) the ocean could take anything. They couldn't see even half of what was out there (A great white shark was unheard of until 1914), and when you go swimming (which was not considered recreational or a common skill until 1900s, more of a sport or survival skill) all you see is some dead desert with no fish.  So people didn't mind just sinking ships or throwing trash. Think about it like this. 

In a 1720s Western coastal town
A few broken glass bottles, wooden ships boxes, fabrics, dyes and hemp ropes, iron tools. Wooden furniture, stones. Nothing really chemical besides gunpowder or lye, Processing chemicals. These items would've only been small amounts, not en masse however. Some of this would have been speciality tools, so would have been maintained rather than thrown away.
'All of this is just part of the world, so you throw it in the ocean and it's blameless.'
Same place in 1820s, you would have seen a lot more domestic junk. More dishware, broken objects with more metals (furniture evolved to require more nails and the upholstery evolution brought staples). 
'The ocean is huge and vast, it can wash away anything' 
Depending on if our imaginary little coastal town was rural or urban or if war occurred, by 1920, there would probably be a good amount of tourist cleaning, due to the steam revolution. Now you've got coal, gas (diesel, the bad stuff), steel which sucks in water, and let's not forget the infamous 'my grandfather did it, you can't tell me what to do you lousy public servant I'll beat you with my umbrella' mentality that came about around this time until like the 2000s.
It's all just a natural progression until people realized, oh shit, plastic sucks and the ocean, as it turns out, DOES have a ton of life.
So yeah sorry for my rant lol BUT these points can help deduce the common mentalities of earlier ages."
