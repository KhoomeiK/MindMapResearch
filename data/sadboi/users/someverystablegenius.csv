They may deny you your award or ask you to leave the troop if you openly declare yourself an atheist.

My advice would be to take a don't ask don't tell approach if you want to earn Eagle. That sucks and I hate it but I doubt the BSA will change their stance in the next few years  Reverant is the final point of the scout law and the most important one to many scouters.

Be prepared to answer questions about how how you show scout spirit and reverence during your board of review. Consider how you can aswer honestly and truthfully but be true to yourself and your beliefs.

Best of luck."

It's hard to watch your loved ones suffer a debilitating terminal disease with the knowledge that it's killing them slowly and painfully and that it will only get worse with time.

depression,f1hb50h,t3_d96jxk,1569489612.0,"In my darkest moments I irrationally wish that I had died of cancer instead of my father two years ago.

It's a recurring rumination that I can't argue myself out of even though Dad would've wished the same thing if I had gotten sick instead of him.

Sometimes I wonder if I would accept my wish if it were somehow offered to me. I can't say I wouldn't take it. I loved my father and he loved life and didn't want to die. 

The shame and guilt my chemical imbalance causes is compounded by the guilt and shame I feel for the I urges I have to end my pain and suffering. The feeling of ingratitude for my life and my occasional wish to end it makes me think of Dad and makes me hate myself more.

Sometimes I spiral into horrible periods of self hatred and loathing because he's gone and I have a chance to live.

Depression is a horrible curse I wouldn't wish on anyone."

The sensation is bad enough in a city or party but I've started feeling recently it with relatives I once felt close to.
