When this first started one of the first things I noticed was an exaggerated motion after-effect. I'd look at a side-scrolling video game, and when the level ended or I looked away my vision kept scrolling by for several minutes. Same thing happened when walking even for a few minutes, once I came back home I'd see everything swirling and shifting for up to 15 minutes after.

I don't play games or go for walks anymore so I don't know if this still happens. One other thing I had for a while is that Id' go to bed and turn off the lights, then for a while my vision kept flashing like a stroboscope.

I've had mild tinnitus for years and that hasn't changed much. I did have a few times year where I'd wake up in the middle of the night with a splitting headache and all I could hear was ringing. I'd fall back asleep and it was gone the next day.

However there weren't any significant events leading up to this. In fact I was doing better than ever. At one point in June I caught a flu that didn't seem to improve much. Then I became increasingly more irritable over the course of 2-3 weeks, for no apparent reason. Then one day I woke up and everything was different.

I must say I've had two similar experiences before this where everything suddenly felt ""different"", once in late 2017 and once in early 2018. I could elaborate on these if you want but I don't think there was any specific trigger. Both times were accompanied by intense anxiety (although nothing compared to what I've been through now) and lasted about a week, and at first I figured this would be the same. But it wasn't.

My current therapist doesn't straight-up say it's my own fault but I do feel that way every time I go there. I must say I have only seen her a couple of times now so that might change. She wants me to go out and get out of my comfort zone. But I don't have any comfort zone, just sitting in my room is uncomfortable enough already. And it's hard to see the point of it all when all your interests and passions were replaced by intense dread and hate, practically overnight. My previous therapists wanted me to stay calm and take it easy. Obviously that hasn't helped much either so I don't really know what would work.

I initially saw emergency mental health services when this all started and didn't seem to get better. They eventually referred me to another place when they exhausted their options, and again after about a year of no improvement I've been sent to where I am now. As I understand this is a last-resort kinda place where they send the difficult cases for long-term treatment, so I don't really have anywhere else to go."

depression,eyj2a01,t1_eyiqqal,1567111305.0,"I had an mri done 6 months ago. But it got so much worse since and they won't let me have another one. I do have a history of severe anxiety episodes, but when I'm calm (like now) it's not getting better."
depression,eyims4y,t1_eyii0do,1567104544.0,Doc keep saying it's depression. I can't seem to convince them otherwise.
depression,eyihibl,t1_eyf80tv,1567102534.0,"I have, but I never feel like that describes what I'm experiencing. Derealization I'm very familiar with, I get that often and it's easy to recognize."
depression,eyigwoc,t1_eyfkg7h,1567102312.0,I know I have anxiety. But even when I'm calm it still doesn't go away.
benzorecovery,exhzabf,t3_csyq9i,1566317619.0,"I tried L-theanine about a year ago, I think just before I started tapering. It put me really on edge and made my anxiety much worse. Much like caffeine, which I developed an intolerance to around the same time (previously it never had any noticable effect on me)"
mentalhealth,ewm7eux,t3_coutj3,1565544919.0,"There's still a tiny chance that things will get better. It might be 0.00001%, but it's still non-zero.  
When you're dead, that chance does drop down to zero.

I know it's not much, but that's the only thought that keeps me going lately."
Anxiety,ewm6nap,t3_cow80o,1565544418.0,It's not helping
mentalhealth,evz1clq,t1_evyjxlz,1564946533.0,"Thanks. I get that these are serious diseases, I'm just frustrated with doctors who are so easy to dismiss everything as ""just"" anxiety/depression without as much as checking your blood pressure. It feels like having any psychiatric diagnosis immediately invalidates anything you say."
