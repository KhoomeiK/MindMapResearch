DoesAnybodyElse,fop840x,t3_g8f691,1587955201.0,Yes. But that’s due to the antidepressants I’m taking. They are known to give people super vivid dreams.
BreakUps,foagzbl,t3_g6bw3e,1587646352.0,"Exactly. I realized I’ve been living in the past (mourning him) or future (thinking about what we could have been), instead of living in the present and accepting the situation as it is; living each moment to the fullest, and never taking a second for granted. I’ve been wasting too much time thinking about someone who isn’t in my present life anymore.

We can never go back in time and re-live the moments we want to. Each second that passes turns into a memory; you will never get that time back. So live your life to the fullest, because every second counts."

antidepressants,fnsicya,t3_g3jq5n,1587222236.0,"Yes, I was extremely agitated and anxious, until my doctor added in cipralex. Now I’m taking 300 mg of Wellbutrin and 10 mg of Cipralex daily. The cipralex tremendously helped my anxiety and temper. This has been the best cocktail for me so far, I feel so much better. My anxiety and depression is pretty much gone. I don’t binge eat anymore, I have enough energy to be productive during the day, exercise daily, and socialize. Apparently adding an SSRI to Wellbutrin is common, in order to balance out the anxiety/agitation due to Wellbutrin."

I have a mini panic attack where my heart races and I look around hysterically, but then realize where I am. So, I’m disoriented I guess for a few seconds initially, but then come to my senses shortly after."

It hurts because you gave him so much of you and he didn’t do the same. It’s so hard to find equality there; I’ve always felt like in my relationships it was unequal all the time. But it is possible to find someone who will love you just as much as you love them; even more! Don’t give up hope. Nothing lasts forever; your relationship didn’t, and neither will your pain."

antidepressants,fkb17qx,t3_fhh8b8,1584024015.0,"I understand; I felt the same. I took Wellbutrin 150 mg xl for 5 weeks, my depression got better but I felt a bit more anxious. I then upped to 300 mg. After 5 weeks I felt super agitated and anxious, so my doctor added in 5 mg of Cipralex to help with the anxiety and irritability. I’ve been on the 300 mg of Wellbutrin for almost a month and a half now and Cipralex 5 mg for 2 weeks. I can definitely say this cocktail is working for me now and the Cipralex helped my anxiety tremendously. 

The first 3-4 weeks are always tough; after that, you should slowly get better and the side effects should subside. If they don’t, consider switching. They say you won’t feel the full effects of antidepressants until at least 4 weeks in. So I would stick it out if I were you for at least 4 weeks and go from there."
