UnsentLetters,fo1xups,t1_fo1x5hn,1587444121.0,Yes yes. Thank you. I learned a lot from that friendship. So I'm thankful for the lessons. Hard Times never last. If we didn't have them in the first place we wouldn't know how to appreciate happiness when We Get it again. The Duality of life
UnsentLetters,fo1u8t2,t3_g580t4,1587441622.0,"Yeah..this sucks. Went through the same. But it made me grow. So I thank them, honestly.    ðŸ’—"
UnsentLetters,fo1s725,t1_fo1rwjh,1587440268.0,"No, you'r not stupid. 

It hurts when you realize someone looks at you differently. Especially when they don't tell you. Maybe they don't know-how. Maybe they think they're sparing your feelings. But this particular person faded out of my life over the course of a year and a half.. when I wish they would have just told me when and why..they just moved on and didn't want to be that close with me anymore. It took me a long time to realize it. That's embarrassing. But at least I finally did"
UnsentLetters,fo1itqi,t1_fo1hs9p,1587434223.0,Part of it yes.
UnsentLetters,fo1ei6w,t3_g55auf,1587431551.0,Wow. I'm right here with you..it hurts so much.
amiugly,fo0zbz6,t3_g1f4z0,1587422653.0,Not at all! You're handsome.
UnsentLetters,fnz2i2u,t1_fnyi3e7,1587384169.0,Not in this case.. It took me over a year to realize they didn't want me in their life anymore. And how I finally found out?..they straight up ghosted me after 10 years of friendship..that hurts

bipolar,fnbur9o,t3_g0ufzb,1586822722.0,"It has helped mine, but it's still there. Its much much milder tho, and I'll take that. I've tried just about all SSRIs and they didn't do jack for me. Hope this helps you <3"
UnsentLetters,fmxwqqp,t3_fxw58v,1586473395.0,"Damn. I relate so hard to this. 

All those characteristics you first named are actually true about you. 

They are what Drew those people to you. You are a good person and people come back because they want more access to your light without having to do anything to earn that access.

Once I learned this...I re-evaluated those people's access and availability to me..I have no one around now. And I'm damn well happy and better off for it."
UnsentLetters,fmwktx9,t3_fxtkmu,1586448376.0,"You will get through this, put yourself first. That's the lesson I learned when I did this. Allowing myself to stay in a situation that was hurting me for too long. That every time I did it I was betraying myself.  For me and my situation I don't think they intended to harm me but ended up doing so because they felt guilty without me even having to say anything. It's a conflicting thing"
firstworldproblems,fmtuaku,t3_fx4rdh,1586379128.0,I actually like the wobbling wheels. They make a lot of noise and people stay out of your way LOL
alone,fmjtlpw,t3_fv7hed,1586137479.0,Awww.  Sending you ðŸ¤—
Poems,fminhqy,t3_fve15i,1586113106.0,Wow. Loved this.
heartbreak,fmhtkhl,t1_fmhrvv1,1586093104.0,Yeah.... but it was my mistake for ignoring the reality of his actions. I got caught up in words. The empty promises. I was naive.. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize and then accept
lonely,fmhr5zn,t1_fmh1q3m,1586091025.0,I understand. Some people think if your face is nice looking...your somehow immune to negative human experiences. It's just absurd
lonely,fmgils7,t1_fmghrm6,1586049899.0,"We all put on our best at first..well most do
 And then the true colors come. Ugh. I don't know. Sounds simple but for me it's something I struggle with."
lonely,fmghfkz,t1_fmgh95b,1586049137.0,"That backfired a few months ago. Its hard. But yes, I know you're right"
lonely,fmggv1d,t1_fmgfhkz,1586048760.0,Yeah. But it's often not genuine..and when it is you question it bc of past bad experiences with people. And its partly my fault bc I don't trust others..Im sure I've pushed away sincere people. But I didn't want to risk being hurt again..so :/
Louisville,f2uz937,t3_deck08,1570437030.0,Try calling the human society and see if anyone has brought your kitty there.. I live in this area..ill keep a look out.

adhd_anxiety,f22czac,t3_db29m6,1569886588.0,"Make sure you eat breakfast before you take this medication. Your sugar levels will drop and irritability is a common side effect.

I was on this medication years ago but I remember my doctor telling me that.."
UnsentLetters,f1th21m,t3_das7f7,1569744183.0,Wow. This is exactly what I wanna say to a certain someone. I'm sorry you're dealing with the same thing.
UnsentLetters,f1rxu3s,t1_f1rwn5n,1569721585.0,Thank you
UnsentLetters,f1roo7z,t1_f1qqhs7,1569718204.0,People who do that to others disgust me..im sorry you're going that. Hang in there... you're not alone <3
UnsentLetters,f1ro66j,t1_f1qwicd,1569718022.0,Thank you so much. I needed to hear that...were not alone in this. My heart is with you as well <3

UnsentLetters,f1qqi4i,t1_f1qqc78,1569705009.0,Yes. You are right. Thank you.
UnsentLetters,f1fo17l,t3_d9a59f,1569448792.0,I'm sorry. This sucks so much. I've been in the same situation before. Took everything I had in me to stop messaging them. But I was able to..It got easier with time. Hang in there..
bipolar,f1erezz,t1_f1eobs2,1569428613.0,I definitely understand. You are lucky to have him..
bipolar,f1eqz6s,t1_f1eo9ax,1569428343.0,"Yes, you are right.

 I'm feeling this way at the moment because in my experience people have confused my bipolar disorder with hurtful Behavior as if it were intentional. And when I'm stable again I find myself apologizing for something that's not even me. I don't know.. I guess it's hard for people to differentiate between the two sometimes. All I can say is I would never intentionally hurt those I care about. If that makes sense?"
bipolar,f0x039w,t3_d6cm2g,1569017883.0,In the fall. Yes. Big time. My doctor told me that seasonal changes can be a trigger.
bipolar,f0vrdz6,t3_d6uzfs,1568989905.0,Beautiful. In my favorite colors too.
UnsentLetters,f0vqsvr,t1_f0vpk9x,1568989476.0,Yeah. I feel ya on this. Going through a similar thing
UnsentLetters,f0vcqws,t3_d6rk2u,1568976555.0,It makes me sad that being honest about your feelings seems to push people away..
UnsentLetters,f0f7nkr,t3_d4p1s2,1568579190.0,No. They were doing it directly to me.
UnsentLetters,f0ezpub,t3_d4p1s2,1568575889.0,I'm going through this right now. I think they don't believe how mean they were to me though.
UnsentLetters,f09s0sg,t1_f09rhnh,1568506167.0,Well said! :)
UnsentLetters,f09ok73,t1_f09l0ch,1568504763.0,"That's okay. They should let that person know they think they're codependent and if they really cared they would try to work on it with them. I'm talking about people who don't even try but say they care.

Each case is unique. You just have to truly evaluate yourself.."
offmychest,f085cwc,t3_d464k3,1568475485.0,I'm going through this exact same thing.
UnsentLetters,f00mvzd,t1_f00if6w,1568303793.0,Me either. How do you not make your own child a priority?
UnsentLetters,ezzprn5,t1_ezxqdjn,1568291016.0,Hang in there. That's what I keep telling myself too maybe one day this will pass. No one deserves to feel this way.
UnsentLetters,ezzpfa6,t1_ezxq1ar,1568290862.0,Im so sorry. I can see that in your username. Just remember you are worthy and your feelings are valid. Even if they can't see it.
UnsentLetters,ezzokd9,t1_ezzld0v,1568290460.0,That must bring more pain to you. Not only do you have to feel hurt by it but also you have to feel and see that in your child. That would break my heart.
UnsentLetters,ezzl5j0,t1_ezzau8r,1568288685.0,Yeah. I'm sorry that happens to you too. It sucks so much.
UnsentLetters,ezzip7f,t1_ezy9g2t,1568287575.0,Same here. I wish it didn't bother me so much.
UnsentLetters,ezxwk2h,t1_ezxsdra,1568251481.0,Yes. It is real. And thank you.
UnsentLetters,ezxo2q7,t1_ezxnhn6,1568245281.0,Same here. Knowing that you're just not as important to someone as you used to be is the worst
