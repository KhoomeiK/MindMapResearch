korea,folinpz,t3_g81c83,1587863049.0,"Yeah, nah."
BipolarReddit,fmgxgaf,t1_fmgb2go,1586060477.0,That's good to hear.  They certainly do suck (antipsychotics).  Too many side effects.
BipolarReddit,fmg52nn,t1_fmemwba,1586041431.0,"I'm a fan of lamictal too.  Interesting that you are on two mood stabilizers.
I've taken some kind of SSRI for over 20 years after being misdiagnosed with unipolar depression.  My problem is I find it really hard to get off them.  I wonder if I would adjust with just lamictal after a while.
Thanks for your reply."
macdemarco,fme74uc,t3_fug26q,1585992202.0,Thanks a lot!
macdemarco,fmdaswz,t3_fuep2p,1585963266.0,Gold.
teachinginkorea,flc6o7t,t1_fl69ewy,1585021310.0,The approach here has been good in regards to testing and social compliance.  If we can push on a bit more it can be basically eliminated.  Then the local economy can start to recover.  I'm in favor of hard measures for a short period rather than drawn out and inconsistent safety precautions.
teachinginkorea,flc6diw,t1_flc4w4b,1585021086.0,Long may the good times last.  Hopefully we can get to not wearing masks soon.
teachinginkorea,fl9n7pa,t1_fl6yl9i,1584962978.0,"Sorry, but I'm referring to Covid-19."

teachinginkorea,fl8nvk6,t1_fl8cgw1,1584928054.0,"I work private.  Going to quit today we work in spaces which make the recommended social distancing impossible.
My company has the capability to use Skype exclusively but they aren't doing so.
Permanent breathing trouble from damaged lungs isn't really my bag either..."
teachinginkorea,fl6rhga,t1_fl6q859,1584881007.0,"Good on you for keeping positive.  Hopefully by April 6 things will be much better.  If everyone at work is onboard, there are temperature checks and social distancing is possible then work would be as safe as it could be I guess.  
I'm working, but the temp checks are not regular and although people are supposed to wear masks for close proximity classes there are problems with compliance and mask quality.  One can't live in a bubble though.
There are plenty of other things to worry about I guess."
teachinginkorea,fl6r2gq,t1_fl6nwfu,1584880600.0,Mainly a health and safety concern with Covid-19.
teachinginkorea,fl6n37r,t1_fl6lsjj,1584876328.0,I was thinking that it might be necessary to take time off.  That or to help them understand certain precautions.
teachinginkorea,fl6dv13,t1_fl6ase1,1584864370.0,Sounds good.  My work has been pretty spotty on testing.
teachinginkorea,fl68ffd,t1_fl68cjh,1584858052.0,Happy with that?
seoul,fkz970j,t3_flf5cm,1584665628.0,"If she is in a bad way then seeing a psychiatrist is a good idea.  Samsung hospital has a good one who speaks English very well.
There are quite a few English speaking Docs at different hospitals, but bear in mind they won't do much talk therapy, mainly prescribe.
I've got a lot of experience getting both therapy and medicine for mental illness in Korea.  D.M. if you neee some more help."
korea,fj4rfqi,t1_fj3c9oc,1583015108.0,"In Seoul it's basically impossible to find any pharmacies or stores with them.  They say they are getting them in, but everytime I go, they are sold out."
korea,fj2uoms,t3_fashe6,1582954606.0,Is this a silly question?  Where can I get some masks?
BipolarReddit,fh7n3vt,t3_f1nh6d,1581338756.0,"It's hard to say, but that sounds like too many if you're taking them all at once.  Hopefully you can find one or two that work.  It might take a while, so it's understandable that they might just try anything to get you some sleep before refining your meds."
BipolarReddit,fh7mmtv,t3_f1c9c3,1581338282.0,"Thanks for your post.  This thread has a lot of insightful comments.  I hope they help.
In regards to post-psychosis cognition problems, I've found that it helps to give yourself a break (even though it can be scary over the short and medium-term), and just let your brain recover.
In my experience, it took more than a year (after a manic episode) until I felt my language skills were close to to what they were.
I got off antipsychotics as soon as I could.  I take a mood stabilizer which works pretty well."
BipolarReddit,fh7lyil,t1_fh6srgq,1581337597.0,"How did you cope with a manic episode without antipsychotics?
I think they are pretty bad for cognitive functioning, but it's hard to tell just relying on anecdotal evidence."
BipolarReddit,fh7ll69,t1_fh564pv,1581337226.0,That's what contemporary research seems to be saying. Exercise is key apparently.
BipolarReddit,fh25m1m,t3_f15fjd,1581236292.0,Probably the caffeine.  Best to ask your doctor though.
BipolarReddit,fh255dr,t1_fgegtih,1581235674.0,Hope things improved for you.  I'm on a similar drug regimen.
BipolarReddit,fge0n4t,t3_exwcnd,1580689151.0,"Perhaps try to put a bit of distance between you and the even at work.  Maybe cognitive reframing might help.  

 [https://agileleanlife.com/cognitive-reframing/](https://agileleanlife.com/cognitive-reframing/) 

Can you go for a walk with a friend or a pet?  Even by yourself, if you can manage a short bit of exercise it will help."
