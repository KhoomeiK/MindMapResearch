Well OG Dolores body and pearl were never destroyed.  Just her memories right?   So maybe OG Dolores will come back?   But just have amnesia or something?   Did she really even die?   Nobody destroyed her pearl.   Or even her new fancy body.   And everything pretty much went according to her plan right?   So I assume she has at least some of her memories backed up some where's.      Anybody know if Ed Harris will be back?"
westworld,fpj3dm6,t1_fpijlmc,1588655455.0,"Caleb rescued her after her fight with Maeve.   Dolores was constantly questioning her own motives.   Probably because the Wyatt program existed in her.   And probably because she was killing a lot of people.    So, she often needed other people to support her choices, and/or finish off her goals.   Maeve, Caleb, etc.   But, she also liked humanity...which we don't truly realize until episode 8.    So that is the real reason she has Caleb 'around'?   She wants Caleb to give her feedback on her decisions."

Copying human's conscious thoughts into a data base?    Ford living forever in a computer program?   people living with sentient thought in simulation programs?   That's why I liked the fact they couldn't make human-host hybrids.    But the rest seems like a free for all.   Are there any computer programmers out there?  Who would wonder if any of this would work?    I know it's fiction...but the writers just seem to make too many things up as they go along.  There needs to be some understanding of limits.   More things that technoly can't do.   I really liked the episode with the Delos-hybrid.   More things like this...would show us how messy things like human conciousness and AI really are
westworld,fp0z1ke,t1_fowtt6p,1588220207.0,"But I do agree with you, Stubb's and Bernhard...shouldn't be in this season.  They are like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

westworld,fp0xq5x,t1_fozlans,1588219308.0,I didn't get that...was really looking forward to a straight up sword fight sequence.   Why did Dolores fry herself (and Maeve)?
westworld,fp03rw4,t1_fp01yme,1588201940.0,"Hmmm...I liked Maeve in the other seasons.   I don't like the Dolores vs. Maeve thing...but I'm going to give my ideas why the Maeve vs. Dolores thing developed.    Lets take out the 'sublime' reason.    Lets also take out the fact, that Serac has a lot of power over Maeve.      I think the real reasons that Dolores and Maeve are fighting?    They have completely different philosophies, on what is right and wrong.      Think about it.....Dolores cold bloodily killed a lot of humans and robots, in cold blood.    She really is the villain.   She is responsible for both human and robot deaths... Serac definitely shouldn't take away free will, but there are other ways of give people free will, without causing innocent and good people to commit suicide right?    I know people don't want to see Dolores as the villain,  because she is also the victim.     She's got 'doe' eyes.   And all the glitter.    She's a farm girl.    But some one can be both a villain and a victim.     In my mind...who are the villains?    Serac and Dolores, they are both villains.   One represents the humans, the other, Dolores, represents the robots.    There are so many examples of Dolores 'evil'.     She made copies of herself, just to kill them off.    That is almost like having children, then killing your kids.    Weather her 'end game' is altruistic or not, is irrelevant...at some point, mass murder, killing your robot brothers and sisters, has no justification.   We have to accept the ends doesn't justify the means.     If we have bad guys (and girls = Dolores).   We also, need 'good guys' and girls.    Really Maeve has always been that character.   She doesn't like Serac, but they have a common enemy.   Maeve definitely, wouldn't want Felix, and other humans to die.    She is the 'heart' character.    She was in love with Hector, who does Dolores love?    Maeve's goal, will be to try and take out Dolores and Serac.    They are both scum if you ask me.   Probably Caleb will be the representation of the humans 'good guy.'    I hate to use simple terminology.   But I think this is why some people get lost in the show.   There aren't clear definitions of good and evil.    And viewers, like to have 'noble altruistic' characters.   At least I do.   I mean, think of the game of thrones ending, why did every body hate it so much?   Oh...there is also Hale, she will most likely develop as a 'good' character for the robots."

westworld,fo80nzx,t1_fnyd58g,1587587815.0,"Well, really I think this is another strong indicator that Dolores is not the 'good and noble' freedom fighter we might like to think she is.

westworld,fo6qx75,t1_fo400i7,1587564990.0,"YES....It was Dolore's words  that said something like 'a copy is not like the original at all""    That is why she wants the 'real world'.

Neither Serac, nor Dolores should have this much control.  All robots, and humans should be able to determine their own fate.

From that picture, you can not see the face of the person.    So there is no way anyone would relate that specific picture with Greta.   So how did the oil company change the picture to 1)   make it look like rape?   2)   make it look like Greta?    Because according to everything I've read so far...that is what is what the sticker shows.   I haven't seen the sticker, because everywhere I go to see it, its been censored.

Really only Kobe Bryant and the accuser know for sure.   I would lean towards he was guilty more than innocent, but I don't know.    I also find it strange.    He was good at basketball.  But if your not a basketball fan, does it matter?   Did he fight for equal rights like Martin Luther King?     Did he put his life on the line fighting for freedom somewhere??    Also, from what I understand, he shouldn't have taken a helicopter...they should have just drove.   Its unknown if he influenced the party to go by helicopter rather than vehicle.    But still...he was the most influential person of the group, safety should have been more priority than time.   And you are damn right about mourning his daughter, not him.    He's definitely an adulterer.   I suppose, for a lot of people, he is an inspiration for young black males to get to the 'big time.'   So many end up in jail, or get shot in the back, when they shouldn't.   I just see the whole thing as a lot more complicated.    Soldiers die every day protecting our freedoms, both black and white, but because they aren't super star atheletes, and not rich, we don't mourn them?   It does seem to have brought the black community together.   Which is great, please don't accuse me of being a racist.    This has nothing to do with Kobe Bryant being black.

westworld,fhr57gm,t1_fhr1azz,1581817675.0,"Good points, however, I have to wonder in hypothetical situations...will Dolores kill off human children 'if they get in her way'?   How ruthless can she be?       Also, why does she not value the other robots lives?   Yes she has a right to be angry at humans.    But if she has experienced suffering and has awakened from the suffering.   Aren't the other robots just as capable of this happening to them?   It seems like she sees the other robots 'lesser' than her...and thus expendable.     Aren't all robots 'created equal, or are some more equal than others??' (ha ha).     Teddy...I believe she changed his coding, and there was a good chance that his mind would be 'destroyed beyond repair.'    They did a good job of the scene, to try and show the viewer, how Dolores was changing him in a disturbing way.     And how Dolores forced him to be changed against his will.   Ok she suffered a lot, and was raped and tortured.   But is she out to terminate the entire human race indiscriminately?     Now I am going to say...nothing excuses raping and torturing...even in a 'fantasy' setting.   But...for some of the people who used the park, they weren't aware that the robots were capable of suffering?      If they were told this, I doubt they would interact in the park in the same way at all.   I realize ignorance is no excuse.    I'm going to say one more thing...aren't the humans and the robots pretty much the same?    Just the robots are less fragile?   So the bloody path that Dolores and body count...of both robot and human, is it really justified?   And what is really necessary to achieve Dolores' goals?    I think...the important think for me, will be to see what Dolores does in season 3.    I just think, she is too valuable a character, to turn into a t1000 'terminator'."

And Kobe's settlement statement so confusing.  Some people feel it was coerced and thus untrue.   Others, thought it  could cause further alleged rape case complications (can someone really claim they didn't know there was consent, and thus not technically be ""rape'?   Many think Kobe should have got a criminal conviction.   I want to make one thing clear....I have no idea what the best outcome to the case may or may not have been.   But it definitely was unique and mind boggling.   At least to me."

I think it was because Eva and Avi were just very arrogant and unlikable characters.   It wasn't like they were in love, so the sex thing was really flat."

AskScienceFiction,fh04di8,t3_f0w3aq,1581200363.0,"is it really that simplistic?    I assume you mean, in the first one...he needed to kill his Father??  And the second time he says it, throw his light saber into the water??   I really think more is going on there than just that.  Kylo Ren wasn't a one dimensional character.       In the first example,Kylo Ren, even if he is the complicated villain,  just doesn't seem like he would kill his Dad.    Second example, did he all of a sudden turn good?   And why did he turn good?    Was it cause he got stabbed by Rey?   That was the only thing I could see...So when he says it the second time?    He doesn't know if he has the strength to turn back to the 'light' side of the force, because he has had visions he will die, if he does that?     Sorry...I probably should have explained my question in more detail."
SuicideWatch,fgtz5xp,t3_f0fyrr,1581111297.0,"It's very interesting thoughts.   And thanks for your post.   Suicide and 'the right to die with dignity' is an interesting comparison.   But also, the right for individuals to choose their own destiny.   I understand what you are saying.  For me, ultimately, it's your life.   Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who would 'rather not wake up in the morning' but still do.   Here, I would agree with the previous post, biology drives us forward.   Not logic, and not any individuals level of suffering.  I wonder if some of your family and friends are just sad that you have depression.  Parents especially, their greatest desire is that their kids be happy, they just want to help.   It's a  tragedy.  There is a lot of 'shaming' regarding people talking about suicide.   To me that is very wrong, and will make the person with depression feel more isolated.  I don't have any answers.   But I can relate to your way of thinking...I have those thoughts myself.   It's very hard, especially for my Mom.   But open and honest communication helps.   They should respect how you feel, without shaming you though"

Even though I'm not a 'big' fan of her music.    I can really admire her courage and capability.   She definitely is very flexible and talent.   She must in great shape to do the dancing moves she does.    I don't think she ever breaks a sweat.    Her style of dance is interesting.    She's pretty courageous.

AskFeminists,fgqwj29,t3_ezwvx9,1581032981.0,"I'm not sure what the Father is trying to say.   But in life, both male and female, shouldn't it be the inside (the soul) that counts?   Do we have to win some game to be of value?  Do we have to be slim, attractive, and flexible, to be of value?   I just wish our society could enjoy the Superbowl, but also do some soul searching.   Concentrate less on the physical and more on the spiritual?   Lookism is a real problem, what about people who are over weight?    Great have fun watching the Superbowl and halftime if u like.   Personally, I didn't watch it, and I don't real value a lot of that sport.   It's all the same stuff, it's not what is important in life to me.   And I'm not even really religious.  I'm glad people enjoy themselves watching this, I just hope everyone doesn't feel that their own body shape, athletic capability, and flexibility has to be equivalent...to the athletes and dancers who were in the Superbowl"
AskFeminists,fgqtlg1,t1_fgqqvkb,1581031219.0,"I'm a man, don't have kids. But shouldn't our society be trying to get beyond this kind of thing?   Of course it's everyone's personal right to choose how they dress and express their sexuality.  And no I don't think women should be wrapped in burka's either.   But shouldn't there be some middle ground?   It's difficult for men too...if we aren't muscled toned and good at sports (example...I'm not..either of these things).   Even though we try not  to let it affect us, for me personally it is hard on my self-esteem.   The half time show reflects the sports mentality.    Being slim, and being able to 'win win win' is ultra personified.   Whereas, our soul and understanding of ourselves is not valued.   It's just seems like it exclusionary to a lot of people.  People with disability, overweight people, etc.   I never understood things like body building pose offs.   Or beauty pageants, I know people say that the participants work hard.   But I would hope we are also trying to think that it's the inside of people, the soul, is important too."
Messiah,fgmyv9g,t3_eyyo7y,1580934561.0,"Sorry, I don't mean to 'pick' on your post.   But ISIS and Al-Qaida trying to 'hot-wire' the Apocalypse?      A lot of people think wars are caused by religion.  But I don't believe that is completely true, nobody is going die for a cause, because someone tells them we have to bring about the Apocalypse.   I just refuse to believe people are that dumb.    What are wars about?   This is what I really believe...wars are about the unequal distribution of wealth.    You have starving people in a lot of countries, impoverished people, and for them, war is really about survival.   We (the people in the west), are basically hogging up resources that we have no rights to.   Mainly Iraq is a good example.    We like our expensive cars, big movie productions, and living to 100...whereas people in the Middle East, have no homes, huge refugee problems, and tons of Palestinians dying every day (yes I agree Jews and western soldiers die too...but the statistical comparison is outrageous).    War is about survival.    And fighting over resources.   Its mostly about that.   Also, for some people, who may not have any kind of life other than a military career.    Its just a job combined with patriotism.   People like to say suicide bombers are terrorists.  They are not...not if we understand the amount of civilians that are dying every day, because of Western poor foreign policy.      There is also the fact, that impoverished nations, don't have the capability to target just military personel, like the military in the west does.   Anyways, sorry for picking on your post.   And sorry for the long reply.    I'll try to get to my point.   I think what I'm trying to say....I'm trying to say what Messiah is NOT about.   More than what it is actually about.    In the Messiah again and again, we are shown that this is not about the military plays for power (we can see this from how stupid Avi is and the other CIA operatives).    The show is about forgiveness, redemption, philosophy, non-violence...etc.    Come on?    Really?    Messiah is the Dajall?   Why does he tell everyone to bury their weapons?    That doesn't seem like a very Dajall thing to do?   The Messiah is closer to everyone else...as things happen to him, rather than him making things happen.    So, he is kind of like you and me.   But with a supernatural force (I believe outside himself), compelling him, and causing things to happen for him.   He has no control over the supernatural force...except it kind of communicates with him.    And tries to help him I guess."

Messiah,fgmw9n4,t3_eyyo7y,1580933235.0,"he NEVER said ""I am Christ"".   He was extremely persistent on that.   Who is the Mahdi and how is he different from the Dajjal?    I suppose this is Islamic scripture?    For someone like me, who really liked the show.    I have to wonder, why does Golshiri have to be any of the particular 'supernatural' characters of scripture you describe?    Not everything is going to fit into scripture perfectly.   We know this, because all the prophetic interpretations of religious scriptures that turned out to be proven false.   End of the World stuff, whereas the world is still around.    Muhammad hated dogs?    What are you talking about?    If he hated dogs.   It doesn't mean that much to me.   Its pretty irrelevant.   Obviously...Gholshiri is something completely 'new'.     He states this over and over again.    So why do people keep saying he is something from the 'old'?    Really he's the Dajall?   Because he saved some people from a  tornado, helped a prostitute understand herself, saved a girl, helped Avi understand himself, saved a boy who was shot, shot a dog that was suffering...thus taking the burden of this act away from the Father, seemed to care about women's rights,  etc.    If Mohammed didn't like dogs...do all Muslims not like dogs?   I really don't think that is true.   Dogs aren't allowed in the house, because there is a scientific reason for that.    Certain diseases can be transferred from dog to human.   He's really no more the Dajall (whatever that is), than he is a terrorist or con artist.   He's something new, and just because we don't know what that is, that doesn't mean we have to decide he is something else."
