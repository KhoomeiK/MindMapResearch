The trick is to get circumstances and systems in place to work despite having the brain issues.

Like, that was my one goal for the entire day. That‚Äôs how basic it had to be for me. Then, I had to get dressed. That was my one goal that next day. After a few weeks, I worked up to filling one job application to be a greeter at a store. I ended up getting hired. The job was really basic, but I worked up to cashier, then eventually up to supervisor. My point in telling you all this is to start where you are and build on it. 

I used my (very basic) cell phone to set alarms to wake up and make very simple to-do lists. Initially, there would be maybe 2 or 3 things on a list. 

When I needed to do a task I considered complex, I would ask someone to show me and record each step as they explained it to me. I told them I was writing it down so I could refer to it later. Most people didn‚Äôt have a problem with it (which surprised me) and even offered suggestions about how to write the steps. ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù initially meant more than 2 or 3 steps. 

It helped me to take my meds, get adequate sleep and nutrition, and have a decent support system. Everyone will have different ‚Äúnon-negotiables‚Äù and those were mine.

Eventually, I worked up to a written planner in addition to using the calendar on my phone, but that took some time. https://www.amazon.com/Law-Attraction-Daily-Planner-Productivity/dp/B076Q8FVZB is surprisingly good for the price, despite how you may feel about the Law of Attraction.

writersspotlight,eya8zzk,t3_cw1df3,1566959922.0," It‚Äôs been over a month I‚Äôve been following this guy, and he‚Äôs frustrating as hell. I mean, he just seems so goddamn *perfect.* I‚Äôve thought of every temptation I could to send him to hell, but he‚Äôs not catching the bait at all. 

Josh is 30, lives with his parents, and works at his dad‚Äôs construction business. Josh likes carpentry and talking to the Hispanic workers his dad employs. Everybody loves him. He is the company‚Äôs diplomat, counselor, mediator, confessor, everything. And he is so good at languages. No matter what dialect or language his coworkers know, Josh speaks in a way that everyone can understand him. The only time he gets a bit annoying is when he invites everyone to the church where he is a youth pastor at on Sundays. But people go. He‚Äôs won at least 30 converts to the church, easily. 

As far as I can tell, Josh is a virgin. I don‚Äôt think he ever had a girlfriend. But he doesn‚Äôt fap and he doesn‚Äôt watch porn. He doesn‚Äôt even look at old *Sports Illustrated* magazines. Josh doesn‚Äôt make a lot of money, but he doesn‚Äôt need much, either. He does seem to like fishing, though, and talking about God. 

I was just about to give up on my assignment to send Josh to Hell when I thought I had a breakthrough. Josh was at the evening wedding of one of his parents‚Äô friends‚Äô kids, and they had run out of wine. His mom asked him to get some more. 

‚ÄúOK, Mom,‚Äù Josh said, picking up a couple of bottled waters before he left. Within 15 minutes, he was back with two unmarked bottles of wine. He gave them to one of the servers, who eagerly sampled it. 

‚ÄúDude, where were you hiding this? This is the best wine I ever had. You should have given it to us earlier so we could serve it first.‚Äù 

Josh shrugged. 

‚ÄúHey, aren‚Äôt you Joe and Marie‚Äôs kid? The carpenter and youth pastor?‚Äù said the server. 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Josh said. Josh never said much unless he was preaching about something or other. 

‚ÄúWell, I saw you came single tonight. There‚Äôs a nice girl over there if you want to dance with her.‚Äù The girl was wearing something so skimpy she looked like a whore. 

Josh brightened. ‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù he said. 

Theft and lust in one night! Finally, my demonic ways are working. I snuck by Josh, trying to overhear the conversation. 

Next thing I know, I overheard Josh inviting the whore to church! Will this guy ever stop? 

Finally, Josh was alone. I decided to break custom from being an invisible voice and appeared in my full demonic glory: 8 feet tall, teeth of a tyrannosaur, red leathery skin, eyes a bright blazing blue. ‚ÄúListen, Josh. I‚Äôve been watching you and I think you‚Äôre not living up to your potential.‚Äù

Most people are horrified when they see me in the flesh. I enjoy watching many of them faint. Josh just sort of rolled his eyes at me. He didn‚Äôt seem fazed at all. It was as if he knew I was there the whole time.

‚ÄúWhat? Don‚Äôt like my looks?‚Äù I said, genially. 

Josh sighed. ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs been 40 days and nights,‚Äù he said.

I‚Äôd honestly lost count. 

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I continued, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not as good as you say you are. Where did you steal that wine from?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat wine,‚Äù Josh said, ‚Äúis my father‚Äôs business. Not yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got that wine from nowhere. Can you turn rocks into bread?‚Äù  
 ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do it for you,‚Äù Josh said. 

‚ÄúIf you jumped off a cliff,‚Äù I joked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd catch you if you would.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put me to the test,‚Äù Josh said. 

‚ÄúLook, Josh, I‚Äôll give you anything you want.‚Äù I showed him a picture of the White House. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you President of the United States. The leader of the free world.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGod‚Äôs my only leader,‚Äù Josh said. ‚ÄúLook, demon, I thought you were smarter than this. Don‚Äôt you know who I am? Joshua, son of Joe and Marie Naz? Who I *really* am?‚Äù 

I then recalled what the Greek name for ‚ÄúJoshua‚Äù was.

‚ÄúOh, *Jesus*,‚Äù I whispered. The ground started shaking under me.

Jesus smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm *baaack.‚Äù* 

As I fell down the deep hole straight back down to hell, I saw the brush of an angel‚Äôs wing to help the Messiah. Why didn‚Äôt I see this coming?

The *Second* Coming?"

To me, it's like sticking with vanilla ice cream and never trying any other flavors. I mean, I grew up with vanilla (Catholic), tried all sorts of other flavors/religions, but then discovered vanilla bean (mystical Catholicism). I wonder about people who stick with whatever they were born with.  They say they thought about it or felt it or something, but to me, that's like saying chocolate is bad without ever tasting chocolate."
