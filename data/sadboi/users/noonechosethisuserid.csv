SuicideWatch,fq46gui,t3_ggl3c4,1589074144.0,"Suicide creates new problems. Like...Have you arranged for the costs of your burial? Does anyone depend on you financially—if so, how will they be provided for? Who will experience the trauma of finding your body? Do you have a will for your money and possessions, and is it probated? Who will clean up the mess your corpse will create? Will you commit suicide in a house? That will lower its resale value and ability to sell it. Many people won’t choose to live in a place where someone has died. How will your family and friends react about your suicide? Have you talked to them in advance, or are they in for a rude awakening? Those are only the problems I can think of off the top of my head. 

Suicide is basically a ragequit on life that causes new problems for the family and friends of the person. Of course, these questions assume you die in your attempt. Not everyone does, which creates a different set of problems."
SuicideWatch,fq2ck3j,t1_fpxofu1,1589054838.0,"I’m not an expert on this, but some people suffer with executive dysfunction more than others in different circumstances. That’s why telling them “just do ____” is completely worthless to them because that part of their brain is just not working properly. They can’t plan and execute. 

The trick is to get circumstances and systems in place to work despite having the brain issues. I admit that completely turning around your life around can take months or years in some cases, but doing small things can make a big improvement in weeks, not years. I didn’t get my master’s overnight, but I was able to get a very basic job with weeks after my hospitalization, which meant I could start earning money again. That was a big deal as I had been told during my hospitalization that I would probably never work again.

SuicideWatch,fpx3r5q,t1_fpx0n3i,1588975099.0,"One step at a time. After my last psychiatric hospitalization, the first task I gave myself was to be out of bed before noon. Like, that was my one goal for the entire day. That’s how basic it had to be for me. Then, I had to get dressed. That was my one goal that next day. After a few weeks, I worked up to filling one job application to be a greeter at a store. I ended up getting hired. The job was really basic, but I worked up to cashier, then eventually up to supervisor. My point in telling you all this is to start where you are and build on it. 

I used my (very basic) cell phone to set alarms to wake up and make very simple to-do lists. Initially, there would be maybe 2 or 3 things on a list. 

When I needed to do a task I considered complex, I would ask someone to show me and record each step as they explained it to me. I told them I was writing it down so I could refer to it later. Most people didn’t have a problem with it (which surprised me) and even offered suggestions about how to write the steps. “Complex” initially meant more than 2 or 3 steps. 

It helped me to take my meds, get adequate sleep and nutrition, and have a decent support system. Everyone will have different “non-negotiables” and those were mine.

Eventually, I worked up to a written planner in addition to using the calendar on my phone, but that took some time. https://www.amazon.com/Law-Attraction-Daily-Planner-Productivity/dp/B076Q8FVZB is surprisingly good for the price, despite how you may feel about the Law of Attraction.

I don’t know if my mother would call it revenge, but I would say the best revenge on a bad parent is to be a good parent. The best revenge on a bad relationship (or no relationship) is a great relationship. My parents are not perfect people, but they’ve been married 44 years and they are still in love. Dad is not an alcoholic or an abuser :) My childhood wasn’t great, but my parents gave us the best life they could. 

Mom did the usual meds and therapy, but I think the motivation to be a wife and mother who could give her kids a better childhood than she had was her driving force. I can’t tell you “how” she did it, but she would say she took things one day at a time, and when she knew better, she did better. 

The healing process is individual for everyone, and I don’t believe anyone “gets over” abuse. It’s something that can destroy you or give you fuel for better things. I still had a difficult childhood due to school bullies, despite everything. But I like to think of the lotus. The lotus is one of the most beautiful flowers, but it doesn’t grow in clean water.

It’s basically a copper rod inserted through the the vagina into a woman’s uterus that folds out into a T. It’s very uncomfortable for the first day or two, but after that, they don’t feel a thing. Since it’s non-hormonal, it doesn’t create hormonal problems. It’s very tiny, so it can even be used by women who have never had children. It’s 100% reversible, meaning it can be easily removed (by a doctor, of course) if the woman wants to have children or the IUD expires 10 years after insertion. 

I’ve had one for over 4 years; it’s never failed me, and I found it easy to get through a regular OBGYN (not Planned Parenthood.) I even live in a “red state” (a conservative state in the US.) it was mostly covered through insurance. I’m not married and didn’t need anyone’s permission.

Last year after I dumped a psychopath boyfriend (I’m using that term in the clinical sense, he probably had a personality disorder) I decided to spend several months alone. No dates. Very few social activities. I made up my mind to enjoy solitude. It was hard at first. I didn’t know what to do because I always went along with what friends or (now ex-)boyfriends wanted to do. If someone asked me, “What kind of movies do you like?” I didn’t have an answer. I would just tell them I don’t like movies. I still have a hard time picking out movies to watch. 

I learned to appreciate solitude and got to know myself a bit better, which was very timely because I’m doing relatively well in this pandemic.

The only time he gets a bit annoying is when he invites everyone to the church where he is a youth pastor at on Sundays. But people go. He’s won at least 30 converts to the church, easily. 

As far as I can tell, Josh is a virgin. I don’t think he ever had a girlfriend. But he doesn’t fap and he doesn’t watch porn. He doesn’t even look at old *Sports Illustrated* magazines. Josh doesn’t make a lot of money, but he doesn’t need much, either. He does seem to like fishing, though, and talking about God. 

I was just about to give up on my assignment to send Josh to Hell when I thought I had a breakthrough. Josh was at the evening wedding of one of his parents’ friends’ kids, and they had run out of wine. His mom asked him to get some more. 

“OK, Mom,” Josh said, picking up a couple of bottled waters before he left. Within 15 minutes, he was back with two unmarked bottles of wine. He gave them to one of the servers, who eagerly sampled it. 

“Dude, where were you hiding this? This is the best wine I ever had. You should have given it to us earlier so we could serve it first.” 

Josh shrugged. 

“Hey, aren’t you Joe and Marie’s kid? The carpenter and youth pastor?” said the server. 

“Yeah,” Josh said. Josh never said much unless he was preaching about something or other. 

“Well, I saw you came single tonight. There’s a nice girl over there if you want to dance with her.” The girl was wearing something so skimpy she looked like a whore. 

Josh brightened. “Okay!” he said. 

Theft and lust in one night! Finally, my demonic ways are working. I snuck by Josh, trying to overhear the conversation. 

Next thing I know, I overheard Josh inviting the whore to church! Will this guy ever stop? 

Finally, Josh was alone. I decided to break custom from being an invisible voice and appeared in my full demonic glory: 8 feet tall, teeth of a tyrannosaur, red leathery skin, eyes a bright blazing blue. “Listen, Josh. I’ve been watching you and I think you’re not living up to your potential.”

Most people are horrified when they see me in the flesh. I enjoy watching many of them faint. Josh just sort of rolled his eyes at me. He didn’t seem fazed at all. It was as if he knew I was there the whole time.

“What? Don’t like my looks?” I said, genially. 

Josh sighed. “Look, it’s been 40 days and nights,” he said.

I’d honestly lost count. 

“Look,” I continued, “You’re not as good as you say you are. Where did you steal that wine from?”

“That wine,” Josh said, “is my father’s business. Not yours.”

“You got that wine from nowhere. Can you turn rocks into bread?”  
 “I wouldn’t do it for you,” Josh said. 

“If you jumped off a cliff,” I joked, “I’d catch you if you would.”

“Don’t put me to the test,” Josh said. 

“Look, Josh, I’ll give you anything you want.” I showed him a picture of the White House. “I’ll make you President of the United States. The leader of the free world.” 

“God’s my only leader,” Josh said. “Look, demon, I thought you were smarter than this. Don’t you know who I am? Joshua, son of Joe and Marie Naz? Who I *really* am?” 

I then recalled what the Greek name for “Joshua” was.

“Oh, *Jesus*,” I whispered. The ground started shaking under me.

Jesus smiled. “I’m *baaack.”* 

As I fell down the deep hole straight back down to hell, I saw the brush of an angel’s wing to help the Messiah. Why didn’t I see this coming?

The *Second* Coming?"

What you are complaining about -- finding bullshit and calling it out -- can happen on any subreddit, especially a spiritual or religious one. Yet, you remain here, blessing us with your enlightened presence and showing us the weakness of our ways. How many people have you persuaded to your point of view? How much are we stroking your ego and sense of superiority? No, I  will not respond to your posts in the future. I'll just smile at you wasting your time on someone on the internet who happens to be wrong."

I've read a lot of Tolle, Zeland, etc., so I understand the OP and the comment. Very concise summary of parallel realities."
Catholicism,exjahgl,t3_ct1a7b,1566345559.0,"To me, it's more impressive (or odd, depending on my mood) to see people who never, ever, ever questioned the faith they grew up with. To me, it's like sticking with vanilla ice cream and never trying any other flavors. I mean, I grew up with vanilla (Catholic), tried all sorts of other flavors/religions, but then discovered vanilla bean (mystical Catholicism). I wonder about people who stick with whatever they were born with.  They say they thought about it or felt it or something, but to me, that's like saying chocolate is bad without ever tasting chocolate."
monkmode,ewpzxqm,t1_es5unwf,1565653388.0,"Not quite. As someone who is going through that process (it kind of crept up on me), I still care about my relationships and belongings but I’m aware that ultimately, none of it is real. It’s kind of depressing. I decided recently that I’ll just be a good person and enjoy my time here while it lasts. I don’t know when my time will be up, so I’ll do good as much as possible...even if on the outside I’m not a huge “success.”"
