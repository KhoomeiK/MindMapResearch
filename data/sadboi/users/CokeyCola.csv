Anxiety,fbcsum2,t3_ecfn45,1576732737.0,"Did I write this at some point? I had this exact thing happen to me a few months back. I ended up losing my job because of a company buyout, but despite all my drs appts and sick days they still employed me and people genuinely cared about how I was. 

60% of my company was downsized so I know it wasn't about me but I understand the TRUE power of anxiety now. I used to puke like every morning and cry, I couldn't eat, my head hurt. Just everything that made me totally miserable and I LOVED my job.

I'm glad to hear, I'm not the only person experience such a great support system at work!"

Anxiety,f2991rf,t1_f296weg,1570086292.0,"I went to drs and a psychologist. Ended up getting diagnosed with ibs and gerd put on pills for both. Started experiencing insomnia and was waking up in the middle of the night, I couldn't sleep got to a point where I was so scared of being in pain I stopped eating. One time I was at my drs and low-key mentioned I couldn't sleep, she put me on klopin and cymbalta.

I went through almost every test in the book trying to prove my pain wasn't anxiety only to find out it was. As for my job? My company actually got bought by another company and my job became irrelevant. After cymbalta not helping my depression she added wellbrutrin.

I guess the short answer is I didn't resolve it my circumstances changed. I believe changing your relationship with anxiety will help, that's what they keep saying. It doesn't go away we just learn to live with it. There were days I forced myself, walking 15mins in the snow bawling my eyes out because I was terrified of what they'd think of it. 2-3 is how far I let it get after 6 months. You have to push through it or seek professional help."
Anxiety,f27j664,t3_dccbyv,1570039405.0,"Don't let this control you. 

My last job I got sick once and took a few days off because I was super sick. My work was really cool about it, my anxiety was not. The second time I got sick, I started to get this horrific pain in my stomach that felt like literal rust. Eventually I stressed myself out so much about missing work that I let anxiety develop physical pain. For almost a year this happened to the point I worked 2-3 days a week at my full time job. I loved my job and I was scared of them hating me for being new and sick and I just let it get worse until working there despite how amazing the job was, wasn't an option."
