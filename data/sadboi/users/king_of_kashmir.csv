I suspect I have Oral Sensitivity Syndrome, but I don't know for certain since the fruit/veggies (and cooked veggies/fruits sometimes cause a reaction) thing is pretty recent and I don't want to go to the allergist in the midst of the pandemic.

How should I treat my diet in the meantime? Working out has been tough, since I don't have a lot of intake. A lot of premade meals (like taquitos, or TJ's small beef tacos) make me nauseous. Even thinking of them makes me feel sick."
