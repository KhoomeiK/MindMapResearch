BreakUps,fn93gon,t1_fn931zt,1586758140.0,I’m doing the best I can. My hope is other people see this and think and realize that this is a pretty common thing apparently. The fault in this hope is that this a thread people come to usually onyl after the damage is done- as was the case for me and probably you
BreakUps,fn9333r,t1_fn9261m,1586757790.0,And if similar was allowed to happen to you I am sorry. I wish I could protect everyone in the world from this treatment or want everyone I can. It seems so backwards
BreakUps,fn92k06,t1_fn9261m,1586757305.0,"A lot is correct but what made this from just bad to traumatic is the way I let it damage other areas of my life after. The job loss was traumatic and froze me in time the way coronavirus has done to many now. This made 2019 fly by as a traumatic year of pain, like I had my eyes shut waiting for it to be over. Something about these traumas in conjunction with the first event is what has made me get stuck on it. 

I have been focusing on new projects and reinventing. A lot of great friends showed up and had my back. 

But I hope someone may read this and perhaps be cautious. I was an extremely happy person taht had it all together before this. I had no idea emotional involvement could wreck it so badly.

The best I can identify is that this was at least in some part “narcissistic discard” treatment. After everything was drained from me I was discarded and not even worth responding to. I don’t know how she was able to treat me so insignificantly but this also increased the trauma. All things I would’ve never done to her in a million years, which is what roped me into it with her in the first place and perhaps not some others."
BreakUps,fn91o9q,t1_fn90opo,1586756522.0,"Interestingly, I may agree on some intellectual level and definitely used to see the world this way. However, I do not *feel* like I agree with this at least right now. I don’t feel that the person who did less, cared less, used more, and took more, should deserve happiness- and certainly not at the expense of the other.

I liken the feelings to a robbery. The robber doesn’t deserve to be happy because of the spoils from the robbery- and certainly not at the expense of the robbed."
BreakUps,fn8xekl,t1_fn8wp98,1586752866.0,Thank you for your kind words. I appreciate this and I wish you the best. I know this could’ve been way worse but I feel so duped and damaged. I will continue to grind on new projects and trust the universe
BreakUps,fn8wulp,t1_fn8wfsl,1586752419.0,"Thank you. I just wish I would’ve realized I was investing so much more than her and, when I started to sense it, had the self respect to dump her the way she so easily threatened to do to me.

It just feels unfair to be dropped into pain by someone like this and to think I was only ever sensitive to making sure I didn’t do it to her."

I feel I understand it but on a shallow level comparatively. I think part of the pain is because you know in your heart whether you intended to stand by the other no matter what. And if you knew you would but then find they wouldn’t, it feels like you were being duped the whole time. Every time you touched her sensitively and passionately with real love now, in hindsight, feels like it was stolen from you. Like if you weren’t fooled you could’ve been giving your all to someone who gave you theirs. And now the time is gone.


I only know a few things that are a fact here. First, it’s always better to know the truth sooner than later. Yes, sooner than sooner would’ve been optimal, but that’s not recoverable. Second, the longer you stay stuck on it, the longer the robbery will last. I’m not sure how to move on more quickly, but I hope you do. I feel sorry for you and stand with you brother.

You’re going to empower him more to treat you like you were the only problem if you confront, get angry, chase, beg, whatever. He’ll say “see how crazy my ex is” and reaffirm the narrative.

You have to just forget about it and start rebuilding brick by brick, the sooner the better. Take it as a loss, whether it was deserved or not, and keep moving."

Your ex may move on to someone else quickly and may even be giving at first, from the tank you filled. But that doesn’t change the physics that your ex was probably a taker. This means, slowly but surely the tank will run low and your ex will start to try to take again. The system will fail at that point.

BreakUps,fen9qyl,t3_eq2x7q,1579280046.0,"The reason you want to reach out is because you became dependent on her for human attention, affirmation, and female approval basically. I can bet throughout the relationship you slowly spent less time with friends and family etc. What you don’t realize is you used to get these things from many sources. What you also don’t realize is, when you dwell after a breakup, you are still trying to direct all your energy at her to get that attention and energy inflow back. The trick is to re trigger the inflow from all the various sources again as fast as possible. Be extra outgoing, talkative, positive, social out and about. Smile at people. Go to classes. Try to make as many friends as you can. The energy will start to flow back again and you will rid yourself of the dependence she led you into."

You have every right to want to move slowly and be comfortable moving forward for soemthing so serious as marriage. It was exactly the same for me, and I felt pressured by the acts she would take to advance the relationship quickly. 

If he’s trying to punish you, then you are so lucky to be free. I feel similar, that she is trying to punish me. But think about it, have you ever done anything to try to “punish” him?

BreakUps,fejdlm9,t3_eph3js,1579168830.0,"You’re being way too hard on yourself. Tbh, sounds like you were giving way more emotionally, and you started to break because of the imbalance. Your body knows when things like that are happening and will start to object. It is further evidence to me that you were giving way more than you got if she just moved on like that and is way better of a person than when you found her. Sounds like you built her up while she broke you down. And if she cared about you and it was really her words that she’d press charges, fuck her. Think about it, would you ever think about saying the same to her under the same circumstance? Or is that something that is yet another one way thing that only she could do to you that you would never do to her? All the while defensible when she does it.

Not to mention “please respond” is not demanding at all, it literally it the most polite thing you could say when you were being ignored pretty much. Like gimme a break. Give yourself a break. 

People are allowed to make mistakes, and you’re certainly allowed to make a mistake in communicating or knowing how to handle feeling hurt. It happens all the fucking time and maybe even more often than not. This is why relationships take work."

It is not saying anything at all about not “acknowledging” what one did wrong in a relationship and/or unilaterally assigning “fault” no matter the circumstance.

And she only did it bc she was scared I was going to dump her for name calling. Not only was she the one getting abusive, she wanted to protect her ego and dump me first to make me feel like shit instead. I’m not thinking greatly abt these ppl at the moment lol.

Kidding aside, really, fuck him. You not being Punjabi is not news. It was a BS excuse. Like what someone above said, even if the other person will gain nothing more from you ever again, if they cared they would never be able to do this. Unfortunately, that leads me to believe you were being used, as I believe I was. I believe this behavior in the breakup revealed to me that the whole time she was in love with the benefits she was receiving, and when she believed those were no longer, she had no care for me. 

It may not feel like it, but the universe did you a solid solid. 

I wish the best for you and I will be surprised if you don’t hella upgrade in due course.

If you are hurting so much it means you were a very giving person in the relationship and therefore must’ve been before the relationship. What you didn’t realize is that all that you gave out into the world (to family and friends etc) slowly got channeled to your ex. Therefore the positive energy you usually got in return from many sources became less, and you became more dependent on receiving it from your ex. After the break, that’s why you feel so bad. And feeling bad makes you want to, intuitively, clam up.

Do the counterintuitive thing and pour out the kind of effort you did in your relationship to as many outside sources. I think you will start to find it pays back in spades. You will see that you are liked, wanted, and desired for your powerful giving traits."

Like so many others, you gave more than you got.  This is, unfortunately, a natural fit for those that take more than they give. 

There is another side to this story, however, I am coming to believe. In order to be a giver, you are an energy source. Without a taker taking from you now, your energy will slowly grow and build up again. The taker, however, is an energy sink. Without a giver, theirs will slowly diminish. They will often go quickly to the next for this reason. 

The short term physics after the break will seem they are happy and whole and you are sad and empty. They are at the top and you are at the bottom it seems.

BreakUps,fdfvdnd,t3_el5hct,1578371223.0,"Fuck man I’m sorry, they are both really shitty for that. I usually hate when people say this kind of this to me but, the universe did you a favor. It cleared out people who would do that kind of thing to you that you did not realize would do that kind of thing to you. They both weighed the value of knowing you and caring about you against the (what will probably be short-lived) connection. Think about it, she knows he’s scum for doing that to you and he knows she’s scum for doing that to you with him. They both know and it is pretty much destined to implode. Hopefully you won’t allow yourself to absorb anymore damage from them now or if and when it does. Your hands are clean and hopefully you won’t have feelings soon enough so you can keep away from toxic leeches like them."
BreakUps,fddf4je,t3_ekr22b,1578309427.0,"I say, be the person you’ve always been, no reason to stop now. If you were good to her, continue to be good to her, but in a way that shows you are also good to yourself. In this case, I think you should say something equivalent to “no thank you.” Something like, “while it hurts me to see you in pain, I’ve made a lot of progress, and it just wouldn’t be right for me, I’m really sorry.”"
BreakUps,fdd3l4t,t1_fdd346h,1578293364.0,"Initially I thought I need to demand it also. I’ve moved beyond that and realize the important part is to be more careful about who you allow yourself to be with in the first place. You can’t make someone into something they’re not. But you can learn from the experience and watch for the signs. With another giver, you shouldn’t feel like you are becoming tired, drained, and suffering any sort of energy deficit.

In an example, an empath + narcissist (not calling anyone here or any exes that, just an example) will leave the empath drained and damaged. But an empath + empath might create a sort of engine, where neither is fighting to receive yet receives abundantly."
BreakUps,fdd2ran,t3_ekpxgy,1578292438.0,"Like so many others, you gave more than you got.  This is, unfortunately, a natural fit for those that take more than they give. 

There is another side to this story, however, I am coming to believe. In order to be a giver, you are an energy source. Without a taker taking from you now, your energy will slowly grow and build up again. The taker, however, is an energy sink. Without a giver, theirs will slowly diminish. They will often go quickly to the next for this reason. 

The short term physics after the break will seem they are happy and whole and you are sad and empty. They are at the top and you are at the bottom it seems. However I think you may come to realize that with each passing day you begin to move up again, and unfortunately they may begin to move down again."
BreakUps,fdcxsxo,t3_ekou2c,1578287481.0,"I’m really sorry bro, I understand the feeling. I often feel like I was better off never meeting my ex as well. If that’s true then at least thank god it didn’t persist even longer. Could’ve been 4,5,10 years"
BreakUps,fdcx64s,t3_ekou2c,1578286927.0,"Dude Fuck her, unbelievable. I’m so sorry on her Fuxking piece of shit behalf"
BreakUps,fd7miga,t3_ek9drd,1578206755.0,"I say this to a lot of people. The best chances for getting back together would come from you becoming happy, healthy, and good looking without her as fast as possible. And the best chances for succeeding without her would also come from you becoming happy, healthy, and good looking without her as fast as possible. Begging and desperation are the exact opposite and we all learn this from experience, as I did in my last one as well. Good luck"
BreakUps,fd7lrne,t1_fd7d7d7,1578206444.0,Awesome! I watched that one twice lol
BreakUps,fd5n4v8,t3_ek40vi,1578179279.0,"If you want to get her back, the best thing you can do is rebuild and get as good looking and as healthy as possible without her, absolutely no neediness. And if you want to move on, also the best thing you can do is rebuild and get as good looking and as healthy as possible without her."
BreakUps,fcznlq9,t3_ejpquq,1578105153.0,I’m just over a year still hurting for a 1.5-2 year. Rebuild brick by brick
BreakUps,fcwlh26,t3_ejaqpm,1578028947.0,I don’t like the thought process that she’s the best you’ll ever get
BreakUps,fcwj84f,t1_fcwj5j5,1578027089.0,"If you are as you seem and they didnt, then no you don’t, universe is doing you a favor"
BreakUps,fcwj35y,t3_ejabep,1578026983.0,You are an Amazing person
BreakUps,fcwj1kh,t3_ejae5r,1578026947.0,"Short answer seems to be no, just says whatever is convenient for her"
BreakUps,fcw0gaq,t3_ej746j,1578014286.0,"Mine by email a week before my bday bc she was afraid I was going to dump her for name calling. Ironically it always seems to be the one that’s more abusive or taking advantage in the first place that also gets away with doing the hurting, and in ways you never could’ve dreamed of doing to them. Fuxk these people. They’re only looking out for themselves, you can see that now. Universe is doing you a favor."
BreakUps,fctk1b4,t1_fctju1q,1577946046.0,Fuck yea!
BreakUps,fct977y,t1_fct92ev,1577936252.0,"Try some Netflix stand up bud, the Seth Meyers is pretty funny. Take care of yourself. There are a lot of ppl like you here and we’re like a whole army on your side"
BreakUps,fct8hxu,t3_eirmee,1577935690.0,This is so horrible. How does the universe permit this shit
BreakUps,fct89h6,t3_eis87m,1577935500.0,"I’m very sorry. If I’m being totally honest, and this could be entirely wrong but, it honestly sounds like she was talking to someone else and maybe more. I’m sorry if that thought hurts, but that’s what it sounds like from my outsider point of view. It explains the abruptness and sudden decision making that changed everything. I’m really sorry for your pain either way and I’m rooting hard for you."
BreakUps,fct7tly,t3_eisedj,1577935161.0,"The problem sounds like you diverted all your attention to her when you got into it, a lot like I’ve always done. I hope you can start to heal. It’s been a year for me too and I feel like I’ve only made inches of progress. Start building back brick by brick, you’re not alone. It’s the only choice and the faster you come to terms and start building the better. Good luck"
BreakUps,fcr9bz2,t1_fcqxr32,1577898650.0,"What I meant for the OPs situation was emotional giving and getting. If a person moves on quickly and “happily” it must be true that they aren’t recovering emotionally from emotional damage or from a crushed self esteem. That could take a very long time.

In your friends case, I question why she was in the relationship in the first place if all that was true. She wasn’t doing him any favors if she was there suggesting she was doing him a favor by being with him. It sounds more like she established dependency and then left. Certainly not interested in litigating that with you, however, that’s just what it sounds like to me from here."
BreakUps,fcpbj1u,t3_eien31,1577857220.0,Happy new year hope you’ll be okay
BreakUps,fcoxg27,t1_fcoxdy7,1577844249.0,Goodnight! You sound so nice!
BreakUps,fcoxbds,t3_eicaox,1577844142.0,"I try to think, if it’s the most painful it could be then at least none of the upcoming days will be as bad as this"
