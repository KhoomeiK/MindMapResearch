AmItheAsshole,ficf43d,t1_ficexjp,1582345291.0,I’m not entirely sure - her ex is a glass blower and they had met at a festival - I haven’t really been told much more. But I know they don’t see each other (I think anyways I believe she’s out of state) the more I think about it the more I oye my paranoia lmao
AmItheAsshole,ficeyqh,t1_ficerjn,1582345172.0,I had opened up IG and her picture had been the first on my feed and his like was the one that had popped up first - I’m assuming bc we’re mutual friends and maybe the algorithms. I definitely need to do some self reflection on why and where the paranoia is coming from. Past experiences? And how to let them go and move forward
AmItheAsshole,ficeikk,t1_ficedzc,1582344811.0,"I didn’t go looking into the amount of pictures to which he liked until I noticed the first, so thankfully I know not to go looking for things like that but when I saw the first one it sort of set me off a bit."
AmItheAsshole,ficee9i,t1_fice9jl,1582344715.0,I totally agree that I think I sort of have to accept that defensiveness May be an emotion that comes out first and that it’s such a silly thing to be over thinking about! We’ve been together almost 2yrs
AmItheAsshole,fice9zq,t1_ficdym2,1582344620.0,I totally agree and I do not know why it has to drive me insane like this!! I appreciate the opinions!!
AmItheAsshole,fice6a5,t1_fice21r,1582344537.0,Ugh and communication is a constant struggle but I’m trying super hard so it was sort of discouraging to have it come back in sort of a defensive way but I sort of get it?
AmItheAsshole,fice3qa,t1_ficdz8r,1582344478.0,Honestly I don’t- mainly bc I don’t really feel the need to. I guess my other question would be why he felt the need to? Is it just natural?
AmItheAsshole,fice016,t1_ficdwc7,1582344393.0,True- is it stalking if he’s my boyfriend? Either way it’s a good point to self reflect!
AmItheAsshole,ficdrnk,t1_ficdj6y,1582344195.0,Early 30’s
AmItheAsshole,ficdpqy,t1_ficdnog,1582344153.0,After I mentioned it to him that she had said they weren’t together I didn’t really get much of a response.
Picard,ffeuo1d,t1_ffbltus,1579866310.0,She looks so much like Lal- do you think so?
Picard,ffeulix,t1_ffbiwgd,1579866222.0,I avoided most of the trailers and SCREAMED when the cube came on screen. Oh. Man.

BPD,fc2q0vr,t3_efshjf,1577370596.0,"I had suffered with insomnia and those damn repetitive negative thoughts before. They are the absolute worst and I’m sorry you’re going through that. If you are 21+ have you ever thought of adding CBD or even low potency cannabis? Because I’m also on ADHD meds, insomnia can definitely strike every now and again. I’ll also be that typical hippie to inquire if you’ve tried tea 🙈 Best of luck dear friend 🙏🏻"
BPD,fc2ptr2,t3_efgqu7,1577370417.0,I feel like it’s a longing of those small moments of peace when we were kids. “Home” was drilled into our heads as a “safe space” even though for so many of us it wasn’t. (My weird longing is wanting my mom for soothing... makes me feel like I’m five years old again.. such an awkward feeling but I almost feel like it’s our inner child wanting desperately to be back in some sort of a safe space 💙
BPD,fc2plxw,t3_efrvx2,1577370219.0,"I’m 32 and I struggle a lot between trying to find answers or a reason and having it eventually fall on my parents. It’s been super helpful (for me, as of lately) to really try and warp that title of “parent” from them. In the end they’re people. My parent people were def not ready for a kid when I burst onto the scene. Am I excusing their shitty behavior? (Hah) no, but I totally understand the similar feeling of loving them and trying not to resent the fuck out of them."

MindHunter,eynm1ru,t1_eymymey,1567252433.0,Agreed. He uses “love” and promises of family as a false support net. Fascinates me
MindHunter,eynm06q,t1_eymv7tj,1567252395.0,YES! The fact he verbally manipulated the “family” -listening to him speak is super intriguing for me bc I wonder- what’s he saying in between the lines?
MindHunter,eym5vlq,t1_eym2en5,1567200266.0,Absolute psychotic.

I haven’t stopped crying 😂"

StrangerThings,evzi1n9,t1_evzenc8,1564958150.0,Thank you so much for the clarification!!!!! I wonder what it means to see him again at the very end!!!
StrangerThings,evyobp1,t3_c90a1a,1564937374.0,"Question/ Clarification: Will’s Doctor/scientist  (Doctor Owens) aka Paul Reiser..that comes in at the very end of the finale, (stares into the closing gate worried) 

didn’t he die in season 2? 

After leading JOPPER and friends up to the surface (before our beloved Bob gets a Gorgan to the face) 
I’m having a faint memory of him being alive after it all went down but can’t fully remember, & I figure if he was able to pop back up? Then for the love of all things, let Hopper be in that damn cell?"
serialkillers,eq2mktm,t3_bvilow,1559740157.0,It’s actually really interesting. Can’t get over those hairstyles though 😂
