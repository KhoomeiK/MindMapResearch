pics,fhxe1o3,t3_f57q2r,1581952161.0,"I grew up in the 90’s and I was the only Hispanic girl at my school. I didn’t read a book about someone like me until I picked up Esperanza Rising by Pam Muñoz Ryan. It’s a phenomenal book, and it made me feel like I could do anything - that my culture and my hair and my language were things to be proud of. I’m a librarian now and I haven’t come across another book about a Hispanic girl for middle-grade readers (or grown-ups, for that matter), so I write them now."

MadeOfStyrofoam,f7ofu3z,t1_f7nkyfd,1573926742.0,"I think that’s totally fair. Definitely talk to your teacher. You can keep it pretty vague - you don’t have to tell them what you’re going through, just that you’re sensitive to certain kinds of violence. If the teacher’s worth their salt they’ll listen and work something out with you. If you were one of my students I would. If not, Sparknotes exists for a reason. The Kite Runner is a great book but my God that author is not for everyone."
MadeOfStyrofoam,f7ng498,t3_dx1x03,1573901549.0,"Oof head’s up, the Kite Runner has a pretty graphic SH scene. Unless you have to read it for school I might skip it."
BorderlinePDisorder,f5spwy7,t3_dp2tej,1572439905.0,"Borderline is not an excuse for the kind of abuse your girlfriend is subjecting you to. I’m not a professional, but I live with borderline and bipolar and have lashed out at friends and family while symptomatic. It does not absolve you of bad behavior. Refusing treatment is irresponsible and unfair to those around you. Your girlfriend needs help. She needs medication and therapy and right now, it sounds like she needs inpatient care. If she refuses, that’s more than enough reason to leave. You can’t be her emotional punching bag anymore. I put someone I loved through this and he was absolutely right to leave."

I tried to counter the zero appetite thing by cooking meals that I like around a schedule and it basically worked. The drug works but it seems to do something different to everyone. I miss my hair ;_;"
