AMA,fqby1gp,t1_fqbx2nw,1589246185.0,"Ah! That’s an understandable position to take. I like it when people are challenged, but nobody’s going to appreciate being insulted while you’re challenging them.

I want to address your position on furries first: they’re just people who enjoy an anthropomorphic art style. They’re not “wanting to be animals” or anything. Think of it like wearing a jersey of your favorite football team. They’re just expressing something they’re passionate about, and I don’t see the problem with that. 

The next thing about being transgender: medical science overwhelmingly supports being trans. I can find you links if you’d like me to. And consider that if they’re really willing to go through so much hardship to be themselves, maybe it’s not just a choice they’re making. Maybe it’s something legitimate that they happened to be introduced to on the internet because nobody taught it to them otherwise. Nobody chooses the hardship, but to them, being trans is so important to them that they’re willing to fight for it. 

The exponential growth of transgender people, in my opinion, is because of more accessibility to information. And as for what you said about being sad and miserable even after they’ve transitioned? I flat-out don’t believe that. I think that you’re ignoring the fact that many people are so very happy after transitioning, and the only reason they regret is is the people around them. 

The thing is, none of that is normal. Everyone knows it’s not normal. They want it to be acceptable, but they know that they’re minorities. 

I want to know what problem you have with things being made up. Any single category anybody can identify with has a blurred definition. Once you accept that everything is subjective, it’s much easier to accept that new categories can be created. 

Another important thing: a lot of people can be making this up, but most aren’t. And I’d wager that they were always here - they just weren’t counted because they hid in their shells."
