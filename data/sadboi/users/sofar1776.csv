SuicideWatch,fqxacyt,t3_glg6f1,1589728920.0,There are hotlines all over. Here is the link to the list we have. https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines
SuicideWatch,fqft854,t1_fqfp4zs,1589331231.0,I was using the name in the picture. Apparently I had the wrong name. I was not aware of that.
SuicideWatch,fqfoi0o,t1_fqfnbqg,1589328646.0,"I am confused here. As a mod of this subreddit, I can check the username to see if it is banned in r/Suicidewatch. I checked for allyah. It is not on the list. If it is a sitewide ban I have no control over that."
SuicideWatch,fqfmzo0,t3_gind1t,1589327839.0,"I don't understand. I know of no username allyah, it is not banned from this subreddit."
SuicideWatch,fq6ifry,t1_fq6hlsp,1589132143.0,"Thank you for being here to help. We are working from different perspectives I think. I have to consider all of the OPs, including the 3%, or the 5% of people with those problems as well as the able bodied ones.     
I am sorry that people have turned on you. I've had it happen too. When you can't do whatever they wanted or tell them what they are hoping to hear they lash out at you. Its a tough thing to do this and I appreciate your opinion. Simply put, the rules are what they are. They predate me, but I agreed to abide by them and enforce them as needed. So I did. Be back in a while, have to go offline."
SuicideWatch,fq6gnfd,t1_fq6fpey,1589131152.0,"This is a place of support. Reddit isn't the best place to do suicide intervention, but its what we have. I see your point, but this forum doesn't allow that approach. Read the guidelines on the right. That's how we do it here. OP gets a lot of latitude if they are looking for that support, but coming here and kicking at them isn't going to fly. That's really all u/brando0o88 is doing. Making assumptions about the OPs like I know you're stronger than this, telling people that its all about temporary issues. Tell that to the guy in the wheelchair, or the person with cancer who is here trying to get through one more day. We get those people, and part of my duty is to protect them from as much harassment as I can."
SuicideWatch,fq6fcii,t1_fq6f2yc,1589130434.0,"And it may well send someone else over the edge. Different people respond to different things, but this is forbidden because it does more harm than good."
SuicideWatch,fq6e871,t3_gh4pdq,1589129815.0,"Removed. Rule 1a actually says that ""tough love"" is strictly forbidden. People are here looking for support, not to be insulted or talked down to."
SuicideWatch,fq6dgp0,t3_gh2wd1,1589129397.0,"I am very sorry for your loss. This is so hard and it seems to comes out of nowhere. We look back and we think we should have seen it, wish we had realized it was coming. But we couldn't see it, nobody can expect you to read someone's mind. May I suggest you also post at r/suicidebereavement? There are sadly many people who have been where you are, trying to make sense out of the unfathomable."
SuicideWatch,fq60hlt,t1_fq5w2lm,1589121891.0,"I am here to help when I can be. Trust our resources, we've looked at them carefully. I know a bit about the people who compiled them and how experienced they are. We have good people here.     
I am sure it will be hard to wait for him to surface, waiting is the hardest part sometimes. I think that texting him now will just add fuel to the fire. You're welcome to come talk about it. I'll help you if I can."
SuicideWatch,fq5vefz,t1_fq5uw8p,1589118437.0,"Glad to help you if I can, or him if he wants to post here too. There is some very poor advice out there and sometimes we just don't know better. There are very good resources as well, the trick is knowing the difference. You are doing your very best to help, and it isn't dumb to be misled. Nobody has all the answers, that's why we help each other."
SuicideWatch,fq5ucys,t1_fq5pbzh,1589117686.0,"I am not an authority or a doctor, but I will tell you my opinion. I think you pushed a little too hard. What we can do long distance isn't really intervention, its support. We need to meet people where they are emotionally, not where we want them to be.     
It probably isn't something for you to take personally. He is upset and hurting and anything that irritates him beyond his own pain will likely get an over the top response. A bug bite on top of a migraine headache seems worse than just the bite so to speak. I can't promise any particular outcome, but if he's doing things like sending messages its likely better than passively accepting that its all awful. He's engaging enough to tell you to back off, and given the circumstances its all you can do. Try to be patient and give him time to recenter himself. Remember to take care of you. Helping people is great, but doing it at the cost of your own health, mental or physical, isn't."
SuicideWatch,fq40rie,t3_ggqbo0,1589072432.0,"You handled it without hurting anyone and expressing love and support. That sounds fine to me. There are a couple things here you can read to help you learn to assess risk and strategies for talking to someone who feels this way.  Please have a look here. https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/     
Also, you are welcome to come here and talk about it to us if you feel you need a little help and support. Hope this helps you a little."
awakened,fpxiyih,t1_fpw764p,1588983496.0,"Of course it does. However, you are missing the point we are trying to make. Full disclosure, I am also a mod at r/depression. I have been trying to think of another way to get our point across, and while this isn't a very well polished metaphor I hope it helps you understand where we are coming from.      
Please imagine someone running around hitting people with a hammer. Obviously, that has to be stopped. Do you take the time to explain to the hammer wielder why he should stop or do you just take the hammer away? In this case words are the hammer and the OPs are the one getting hit. Words can do irreprable harm to the vulnerable people who post there, and that cannot be allowed.      
I hope you see what I am trying to say."
SuicideWatch,fppwpdb,t3_gevo1c,1588810629.0,"While it is good of you to offer, it is against the rules. Please read the guidelines and it will be explained there."
SuicideWatch,fppwhuz,t3_gevi59,1588810513.0,We can't let you source methods. Its that simple. If there is another way I can help. please talk to me.
SuicideWatch,fpidldl,t3_gdn5yr,1588638721.0,"I am sorry you have to go through this. They shouldn't be putting that weight on you. You are not responsible for them. That said, here is a thought. If you go here https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/     
there is information about how to assess risk and some simple strategies for talking to someone who feels that way. That way if you wind up in that situation again you will have some idea of what's happening. But please remember, its not your responsibility to deal with this. I don't want you to think I am putting you down, but at 13 it isn't time for you to have to handle this."
SuicideWatch,fpia7cg,t1_fphtowi,1588636760.0,"I am glad to hear that, but we just can't let that sort of thing stay up. Sorry if I upset you by removing it."
SuicideWatch,fphtj0u,t3_gdkczb,1588627533.0,We can't allow suicide pacts here.
SuicideWatch,fou8k66,t1_fou7ci4,1588078882.0,"Well, I have some similar experiences. My SO dumped me after 21 years about 4 years ago. So I know what its like to have that bomb dropped on me. I'm sure you gathered I am a lot older than you. Maybe I've learned a few useful things.     
There are subreddits for people in troubles, like r/almosthomeless which have experienced advice for people facing that. I don't know much about that, but enough to send you toward someone who does. There are resources for employment depending on where you are. There are some jobs hiring that don't require a degree, trades, shipping and so on. Maybe we can come up with a few ideas."
SuicideWatch,fou7adp,t1_fou3ztc,1588078022.0,You're welcome. Do you want to talk about what's going on? Do you want some probably not too relevant advice? How can I help?
SuicideWatch,fou3075,t3_g9lm1y,1588074744.0,"I am sorry its been so hard. A lot of people who post here use an alternate account, its not an issue."
SuicideWatch,fou2ti0,t1_fot72au,1588074587.0,"I understand worried, but inciting a lot of people to go talk to someone is a bad idea. Think about it. If you knew someone IRL who was upset would you run around town trying to get people to go talk to him? It just makes things worse. Please read the guidelines in the sidebar."
SuicideWatch,foso4og,t3_g970s7,1588034578.0,"This is called brigading, and it is one of the worst possible things you can do to someone who is suicidal. It is also not allowed here for that very reason."
SuicideWatch,forwma3,t3_g98kvp,1588019793.0,"If someone here is doing this sort of thing, we would like to hear about it. It isn't allowed here, and I hope you would report it so we can take steps."
SuicideWatch,fonyvcp,t1_fonkegb,1587929184.0,Glad to help.
SuicideWatch,fonix61,t3_g8hne3,1587920370.0,"My first suggestion is to look here. https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/    
There is information about how to assess risk and good tips on how to talk to someone who feel this way. You can also find a hotline number through there if you feel your friend might talk to one, or if you want real time input from someone while you try to navigate the situation. You are a real friend for trying to help, and she's lucky to have you. Hope the information helps."
SuicideWatch,fo5052j,t1_fo4wjzp,1587514687.0,"You did just fine. Let me know if I can help, but you're already talking to one of the best. I misunderstood to begin with, I thought it said wouldn't recommend. Sorry for the confusion."
SuicideWatch,fo4wj6g,t3_g5j5pz,1587512607.0,We can't discuss methods here. It breaks our rules and Reddit's.
SuicideWatch,fo4vxtv,t1_fo4s468,1587512276.0,Why not message the moderators? We're here to help.
SuicideWatch,fo4hfce,t1_fo3wz0s,1587504474.0,Why not?
SuicideWatch,fo0idjn,t3_g4tsqs,1587413681.0,How can I help?
SuicideWatch,fnvjfu7,t3_g45smn,1587295564.0,We can't allow anyone to be doing that here. Would you care to tell me why you feel this way?
SuicideWatch,fnbwle7,t3_g0tnqh,1586823765.0,"You report the post with the link under the post, no matter what subreddit you found it in. If it was a PM, there is a link to report that as well. Or you can send the conversation to us and we will look into it."
SuicideWatch,fnbvgxj,t3_g0uenq,1586823124.0,"What you are doing is called brigading. Calling on everyone who reads your post to help this person. It doesn't work out well. If twenty or thirty people start messaging this user, it can make matters much worse. It violates sitewide policy and can get you banned from Reddit completely."
SuicideWatch,fn3exuo,t3_fz6ztp,1586619349.0,We can't answer that. Its against reddit rules and r/suicidewatch guidelines to explain that. Do you want to talk about why you think this is the answer?

SuicideWatch,fmtmu1j,t1_fmtkep5,1586375439.0,Glad to help.
SuicideWatch,fmtjn0x,t1_fmrne8p,1586373858.0,"Apologies for taking so long to get back, I just got home. I am glad you have read the rules, and see the reasoning we are using to get to them. I would say as a general rule that if you are looking for support, whether you are considering it in the next two hours or 12 months or whatever that you are welcome to post here. You are aware that discussing methods isn't allowed, so you're good on that score.     
If there is a harassment campaign against you on Reddit, you will need to talk to the admins, who can cross subreddits. I have no ability to do anything outside of here. That can be done at reddit.com/report.  I hope that helps answer your questions."
