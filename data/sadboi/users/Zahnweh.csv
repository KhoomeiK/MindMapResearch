I mean, not counting those that are already in circulation due to removing them from the dead, or taking them from the living.  Then again, some of the notion of how a PIP-Boy can be removed, or if it can be removed at all from a Dweller seems to change between Fallout titles.  I think it was Fallout 3 that stated that they had a biometric lock that prevents their removal.  At the same time, I remember them stating that some Vaults were lucky enough to get higher quality models over other ones.  The latest made Vaults having the most up-to-date models before the bombs fell.

That's just me rambling on though, the idea of people running into and claiming PIP-Boys from fallen Dwellers, or someone giving theirs or selling it isn't unheard of.  So you do have a lot of options."

When something ferments, it produces CO2 as a natural byproduct, and so you bottle the drinks with a type of yeast that lives off of the sugars in the drink.  It produces CO2 which gets infused into the soda, so there's a little alcohol as a byproduct of the carbonation, but it's so small that you'd need to drink a shit ton of the stuff to really see results.  As a plus side, putting the stuff in the fridge will put the yeast to sleep to keep it from going crazy and blowing shit up."

Three Dog reflects the sort of rebellious passionate voice that goes against John Henry Eden.  

Mr. New Vegas is charismatic, warm, and welcoming, but he's a puppet for Mr. House to advertise New Vegas.   He is a relatively calming voice that I miss since leaving the Mojave.

Travis is our nervous bumbling host for Diamond City Radio.  He voices the fears, concerns, and the paranoia that still plagues the wasteland.  I always felt that Travis really embodied the voice of the everyman better than the other two.  Even in his ""charismatic"" version, it feels like a facade that he's trying to put on."

Travis is just a sad sack of nervous energy, and I love that about him.  I can't stand giving him confidence, because he just becomes annoying.

I guess I find her cheerfulness to be forced for the given situation that we're all in.  Optimism is good and all, but it just feels wrong for the place and time.  I mean, it'd make more sense if she was just in a constant state of being high from chems to dull the pain, maybe slightly psychotic or depressed.

A kitten's first few years socializing are the most important in their life, it's what can turn a feral into a somewhat domesticated little love ball.  I say somewhat because they still retain little things from their feral childhood, especially if they're found later on.

Fallout,fps5afb,t3_gf9108,1588867702.0,"In Fallout 3, I preferred Megaton over Tenpenny Tower, but that's more to do with that I prefer an actual house over an apartment.  I loved the Mister Handy that you got as a friend/butler, and I preferred the Vault Theme for my house.  Although, the science theme wasn't too bad either.  

New Vegas was my favorite, I loved my apartment in Novac and I frequented there so much more than anywhere else.  The place you get in the Lucky 13 isn't bad, but I hate sharing with companions.  The Sink is the best though.  :)  Especially when you upgrade it fully, it is the ultimate home, and all the AIs that you can chat with (I love Muggy the most).

In Fallout 4, I prefer modded player homes, I tried to make the Sole Survivor's home into my personal base once, and got annoyed that people kept coming into my house and messing with my things.  I really hate being intruded upon, and I loathe it when something I feel should be mine is ""shared"" by all the NPCs in the area.  I'm not a sharer by nature.  Home Plate isn't bad, but I like to customize an area with as much options as I can, and I hated that I couldn't really make it feel like a home to me.  Not to mention, I love making bathrooms for myself, and that wasn't really an option for Home Plate.   I forgot what I went with for my old favorite for mods, but some of the new options don't look too bad either.

That's when a large amount of plasma begins to displace into the surrounding tissues of the legs and/or hands due to poor circulation.  One of the symptoms is swelling, and if you push on the area with your finger (or have socks on), you can produce indents that last longer than just normal impressions.  I learned about this with my grandmother, she started developing this condition which required her to have her legs wrapped constantly to keep the swelling down."

It doesn't seem to be sexual gratification for most of them.  Sadism?  The fact they act like retarded spoiled children at times?  That they combine something utterly saccharine and sweet with such a vicious level of violence in response?  There's something there.  Something that triggers people in an instinctual level to either love, or utterly hate it to the point of inciting violence upon them."
WTF,flfu4ov,t3_ff8m8v,1585117872.0,I'd be wondering how they're getting inside the house.  Is there any entryways that can allow them to get into the wall from the outside?   Do you think that there's something that is drawing them in?
MorbidReality,flcw1is,t1_flcpds1,1585048822.0,"One thing I can imagine is their location, they are in a very warm and humid area, so they would be rotting at a very fast rate.  Even with the measures they were performing, the bodies just quickly decomposed and reduced down into something impossible to transport.  The large grouping of them also made it hard to distinguish bodies from each other, they would gradually just melt into each other."

Depending on how you look at it, you are a microcosm for these things, and there's countless things that depend on you just as much as you depend on them.  Some are important for your immune system, others help with digestion and the breakdown of consumed nutrients."

I do have a discord for talking if you wanna chat while we play.  XD  I know there's an app for that, but sometimes it is easier just to do it on the computer.  Then again, whatever works best, even just chatting through AC:NH.

One thing to note is that I am on the Pacific Time Zone so it will be nighttime for me.  I hope that it won't be too inconvenient.

My native fruit is Oranges, but I'm currently working on growing other fruits to help others.  Any little bit helps, but it isn't necessary to just have fun and explore islands.  :)  I hope to see you guys around.

I currently also have Apple, Peach, and Coconuts growing around my land, only Coconuts are fully grown and ready for harvest."

She was my rock, my best friend, and my constant companion so when she passed, I took it hard.  It's never easy to lose someone you love dearly, and the pain will take a long time to heal from.  Even six years after she passed, I can still find myself crying if I reminiscence about it.  One way to heal is to get the best picture you have of her, frame it, and put it somewhere that you can look at.

I'm so sorry you lost her."
Natureisbrutal,fiq6fr8,t1_fgsts1b,1582636504.0,"Put it like this.  Fighting uses a lot of energy and calories, and the risk of injury is not worth the effort.  If you're injured, even a small wound can be life threatening, and if it they can't use a limb, they will be that much easier to kill.  It is easier to escape when you have the chance, and predators tend to go after what is easier to kill for them.  A calf, a sick adult or an elderly animal are all easily picked off if they can't keep up, and it allows the rest of them to get away while the predators feed."

Natureisbrutal,fiq3x3u,t1_fidnvxi,1582634291.0,"Most predators go for a point on the body that is easiest to wound and get into.  The anus is a natural opening to exploit, not to mention that ripping into these areas tend to affect ones ability to run and retaliate.   Can't really run with your anus torn open, even if you tried, the likelihood of expelling some of your organs, or having them pulled out can cause massive trauma and shock from blood loss.  Organ meat is also full of essential minerals and nutrients that predators need, they will prioritize devouring these above all else.  Think of it like this, the predator can try to rip open the stomach, and it might take longer to get into which risks them having company that might try to take their food from them.  The better option is to exploit an already available opening, less work and more opportunity to quickly get what you want before competition arrives."
Natureisbrutal,fiq36k1,t1_fieknnt,1582633580.0,"They don't kill with bacteria.  The bacteria load in their mouths is no different from most carnivores, the thing that makes them deadly is their venomous bite which has mild anti-coagulant properties.  This causes the animal to not be able to clot their wounds, bleeding out even from a minor wound over time.

A source that shows the anti-coagulant properties of the venom in action.  The rumor of them using bacteria is ridiculous and laughable."
Natureisbrutal,fiq2kg2,t1_figjlwb,1582632966.0,"They actually showed in a video that Komodo Dragons have venom that they produce through the act of biting similar to Gila Monster venom.   For Komodo Dragons, they have an anticoagulant venom that causes the animal's wounds to not heal or clot effectively, thus increasing bleeding and the risk that the animal will slip into shock from bloodloss.

Natureisbrutal,fiq1s9q,t1_fioeaot,1582632124.0,"I imagine that it is a defensive reaction, they try to camouflage themselves in the underbrush and there is a chance that predators might not notice them.   Their mother couldn't defend them, nor can they be expected to outrun a lion pride so staying still is their only option for protection.  In the case of why they were killed, I imagine it is the dominant lioness trying to kill potential competition for her own offspring.  Not positive, but that's just me guessing."
