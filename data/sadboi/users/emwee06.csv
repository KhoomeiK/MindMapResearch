This is 2 taekwondo classes a week in a white belt class. When he moves up to orange he will also have a sparing class once a week AND move up to orange-green belt classes, still twice a week. 

7yo has also shown interest in tumbling. He took a boys only tumbling class geared for his age last year and loved it. This MA school offers tumbling classes one town over (which we will get at a discounted price) AND one of the instructors said that he sometimes stays after classes to work on some tumbling skills at our location. 

The 36mo Black Belt Club is too much right now. Leadership Team, Demonstration Team, Competition Team, weapon training through green belt, and estimated to reach black belt in 3 years. Im happy with none of those teams at 7yo. I started gymnastics at 5yo and was competing within a year. I LOVED it, but my loving Mom struggled with the daily practices during the week and the meets hours away every Saturday. Plus exhibitions, ballet classes, gym-rat moms with their attitudes, and thats not even taking the money spent in to consideration. 

Another Mom was up there paying for 2 weeks of unlimited classes to see if their 6yo would stick with it. I just dont think thats how we need to start. I think we need to jump in to this with routine and confidence that THIS is now HIS SPECIAL activity. It comes after school but before any other functions/play dates. I have looked around at other schools in town. There are cheaper options, but they are farther from my home/kids school.

I like having the control over my days. The euphoria is LONG gone for me, I'm not chasing the ""super woman"" feeling - but there are some days where I need my ducks in a nice row sorted by size. Other days are smooth as long as all my ducks are in the same pond.

EDIT TO ADD: I've found that keeping notes on feelings, concerns, questions, anything and everything between my med checks.. really helps me talk to my doctor. It's amazing how fast things slip your mind when you're basically in the spotlight."

I can't tell you how many times I've paused in a conversation and the pause was awkwardly long, I finally ask if he heard me, and it's ""I didn't know that needed a response."" Even if we're having a good time and there's no tension. ...but by golly if I don't answer that text it's ""that's what I thought"" 10 minutes later. OR this: he ALWAYS makes me, our bio son, my step children come to him. Ask for a hand? Yeah, come here. He wants to tell/show you something? Hey xy, come here! He even does this trying to apologize. Its always happened, I just didn't really notice until I started feeling like he looked down on me - maybe 6ish years in. 

Sometimes when he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed (or couch, depends on the previous evening) and it ends up one of those mornings - but he calls me before he gets to work and apologizes, I think that maybe he sees my side and is really trying. It's doubtful, this has been going on a while.. but it helps the emotion roll off a little easier."

It's hard and is not at all healthy.

I don't care if youre over it three hours later and want to send funny memes. It's immediate defense mode : I'm starting an argument. I didn't say those things. Maybe if you'd fix those things I wouldn't throw it at you. Door slamming and anger until I just let it go like he has.

bobdylan,feznaog,t3_eqw8k2,1579459278.0,"I am a Dylan lover through and through. My husband says the ""he can't sing"" thing all the time but is a pretty good sport when I get on kicks. My son knows more Dylan songs at 7yo than most adults. 

When others make this comment to me I don't rebuttal with a song example - but with lyrics. If his voice rubs you the wrong way, fine. But do not question the amazing words and poems that come out of Dylan. 

You know how parents buy a copy of ""Oh, the Places You'll Go!"" and get teachers to sign it every year? 
Yeah.. I have the illustrated book of 'Forever Young' and send it to kiddos school at the end of every year. The magic is in the message, not the voice! 

I will add, though.. Nothing Was Delivered speaks to me, but I don't like Dylan singing it. My Mom is a huge Byrd's fan and their cover is not one of their better songs but it's easier to listen to. 

If I had to pick one song to change a stranger's mind I think I'd go simple: Maggie's Farm. It's catchy, tells a story, and fits Dylan's range well."

depression,feow98z,t3_eo6wdd,1579306762.0,"YES. DO NOT MISS A DOSE OF THIS STUFF. 

I went through 7 meds before settling on Pristiq. It was such a life changer that I didn't even mind paying the $100 it cost per month (this was before they made a generic). I soon realized that if I forgot a day I wouldn't make it 48 hours without hitting serious withdrawals. All of these (below) hit me immediately like I ran into a wall around hour 36. One forgotten dose after I'd been on this stuff for over a year was exceptionally terrible: I took one as soon as the dizzy/nausea hit and laid down to nap. I woke up from my nap, walked around my house, started talking to my family and realized some things they were saying just wernt right. My brain put two and two together and realized I wasn't actually awake.. so ""we"" (brain and I) tried again. This time I did some things getting up to make sure I was awake.. only to discover that once again I wasn't actually awake. Third try I looked in the mirror and slapped myself. I SWEAR I could feel it.. but still no. When I finally truely woke up all I could do was cry. It was the single scariest thing that has ever happened to me..   ..and I've been in some iffy situations. 

""Stopping desvenlafaxine abruptly may result in one or more of the following withdrawal symptoms: irritability, nausea, feeling dizzy, vomiting, nightmares, headache, and/or paresthesias (prickling, tingling sensation on the skin).""

I actually found this post by searching Pristiq in Reddit. I've been working on getting a refill since Tuesday, knowing I'd take my last one on Thursday. I had refills but insurance needed a prior authorization and between doctor's office, pharmacy, and insurance everyone kept dropping the ball. I JUST got home from the pharmacy where I was almost in tears knowing itd been about 30 hours since my last dose. The insurance circus still wasn't coming through so I paid out of pocket simply to avoid the withdrawals. 

I'm now terrified that I'll end up in an emergency situation and stuck somewhere without it. Or my purse gets stolen if I keep it with me. Or any of the scenarios that could possibly happen to force me to miss a day. I have talked with my doctor about weaning off but that brings us to the next issue which is what to try instead, as well as how I'd cope with my busy life during the twoish months it would take to wean off 100mg/day and adjust to a different SNRI."

NarcissisticAbuse,fe7t98z,t3_eo16kp,1578919025.0,"I needed this. 

It's 7am. I didn't sleep at all last night. I let him come back under the impression we'd both make adjustments. It's been two months and I spent the weekend calmly explaining, nicely pointing out examples in conversation of the tone he uses that makes me feel dumb. The way I start a story and two lines in he's interrupting by questioning a small detail that is irrelevant. But if I pause for comment after a statement that does deserve a reaction I get... nothing. Literally. I feel like I have to ask ""did you hear me?"" 90% of the time. Typically the response is ""I didn't know that needed a response."" 

When I'm finally defeated, dogs are fed, kids asleep, and I curl up somewhere to zone out it's immediately ""you're always on your phone."" or any other number of ""you don't get alone wind down time"" statements. 

I didn't sleep last night because the last thing he said after I was so gentle with my pleas all weekend was : ""it shouldn't take effort to have a conversation.""

Well. I shouldn't be having to pull your half of the conversation out like it's one of those tiny elastic bands in a well-loved Barbies hair. 

Thank you. I'm getting a shower and putting on my crown and a smile today."
NarcissisticAbuse,fe41c4p,t3_ennrpq,1578854834.0,"That's more dialog than I'm allowed. 

I introduced my husband to Reddit a few months ago. He unwinds by scrolling just like I do, great right? Now he understands and can't use ""nose in your phone"" as ammunition.  - thing is, my husband can crunch numbers faster than a calculator, but simply can not read and listen at the same time. After 10 years I am accepting of this and have said time and time again to just say ""I'm reading"" if he's reading. That way I don't feel ignored or like he's simply not listening. 

Well, of course he NEVER does this. 

The BIG issue, is that he never responds, makes a noise, head nod, nothing. Ever. If I pause a conversation then it's over. If he's reading, ok. It's gotten to the point where he does it constantly. I have to ask if he's listening. Or if he heard me. Or to repeat what I just said. ""I'm listening, what did you want me to say?"" is the typical response. 

Last night was awful. Some was Reddit, I'd be telling him about something and he'd interrupt with ""haha look at this!"". Most was him playing one of those mind numbing phone games and just zoning out. I tried to softly explain that I'm tired of one sided conversations. I can't EVER tell if he's listening. I wasn't angry, I was just trying to guide him down the path of ""when you get mad, the first thing you do is hark on me for never spending time with you. You say I'm always on my phone, which is false. I HAVE my phone because I'm listening to music while I buzz around the house doing everything, but I have made a huge effort to cut down on my zoneoutonreddit time because YOU said that's our biggest issue. Now I'm asking you to realize that I've made it a point to conversate and relax this evening, and I'm having to pull your half of the conversation out bit by bit."" 

He literally did not say a word. Or make a noise. Or shrug his shoulders. Or even look up from his block version of candy crush. 

Welp. No fake ""I understand."" He accused me of starting a fight, which I dodged. But happy time was over. I'm not sure what red flags he missed. I got my headphones, I swapped to the back porch so I could just sit with the dogs. I didn't turn music off when he would come hug me or kiss me. Hell, I didn't WANT to go to bed.. but he waits on me. 

This morning first thing: ""you gonna get up today?"" 

""Oh, these are my favorite days.."" as I strech. I'd been awake. My child's cousin had been calling him on kids messenger for the past hour, my Mom was sending her routine of pictures of articles from the paper she was reading, ESPN noises from every device started early.. 

He asks my plan for the day. Id told him my plan last night, but.. remember.. doesnt listen. Cue attitude. He was just trying to be civil. I asked why he needed to be civil if we wernt fighting.. to which he EXPLODED on me about staying up late on my phone probably talking to other guys. Why can't I just go to sleep (on his schedule, no matter what). Why I'm always on my phone. How I ruin his off days.  He ASKED why I ended up ignoring him out back until 3am, when I tried to say ""because I tried to talk to you about something that was..."" -cutoff immediately with talking over me. Telling me why. Fussing at me. 

...I've learned to just not even attempt to answer. It's not worth him getting louder. 

He left. I think to take oldest SS to hit some baseballs. My chore for the day was fixing the chainlink fence that my dog likes to dig under and cleaning our dogs ""room"". Laundry room with a doggie door and super handy, but after a week of rain it's a diataster. Mud, accidents, smelly.. when I clean this room it's a two hour chore. Laminate doesn't dry quickly. Fixing this fence isn't exactly a quick chore, either. Both would go faster with some help, but..."
