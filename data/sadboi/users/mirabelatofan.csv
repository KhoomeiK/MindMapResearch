KDRAMA,fpl9i6z,t3_ge1li6,1588708736.0,"I don't enjoy watching dramas with Seo Hyun Jin, I think she always is such a strong FL and does not fit with the rest, I did not like her in Let's eat 2 and it was very hard for me to finish the drama because of her and in Another Oh Hae Young (which I consider a good drama) I think I would definitely enjoyed more if it had another FL.

I also don't like Choi Kang Hee, I don't know why but I find it  very hard to watch dramas if she is part of the cast.

And I have mixed feelings regarding Gong Hyo Jin. I really liked her in It's okay it's love and Master's Sun but I think she was annoying in The Greatest Love and Jealousy Incarnate. I would like to watch When Camellia Blooms but I won't because of her."
KDRAMA,fnx00j0,t1_fnw8a8a,1587328807.0,I always think of his vampire days when I hear his name. I think this role fits him so well.
KDRAMA,fnwzn2w,t1_fnpi9dt,1587328595.0,"Is this drama really good? I wanted to start it but I can get myself to do this, I just want to know if it's worth it especially because I already have a long list of dramas I can watch."
KDRAMA,fnwzabh,t3_g2n3mz,1587328393.0,"It happens to me sometimes (with Encounter, Level up, etc) but if I'm annoyed with a part of the drama and I still want to finish it because it's good I usually just quickly skip the annoying part. I also did this with The world of the married because the plot was good, no regrets so far."

Don't forget that you're young and you have plenty of time, so even if you are tired of getting to know people now maybe you'll change your mind in the future. (And if you don't that's totally fine, you can do what you want, focus on your carrier and still be happy)"
dating,favubd4,t3_eamxn4,1576362275.0,"It's really hard being in a long distance relationship (talking from my experience). I hope you'll be able to see each other again in the future or meet good people, you deserve it, and you did your best, it was just not the right time. You'll be okay, time really helps, don't worry, just focus on you."
