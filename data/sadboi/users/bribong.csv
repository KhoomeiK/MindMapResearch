I want to see other people's perspectives and understand but I just have a really hard time. I don't think the punishment fits the crime  - they are living in overcrowded, unhygienic conditions putting them at risk for starvation, dehydration, numerous illnesses and diseases, rape and even death. Logically, I can understand that they committed a crime. Morally, I don't see why they deserve that punishment."

If they do want to get off, they get put on medically supervised withdrawl where they decrease in dosage by a few mgs per week and have to see our doctor at least once a month. Other patients are content with being on it for the rest of their lives, because they know it's better than returning to heroin or because they don't want to risk relapsing"

Well I studied abroad in Prague for six weeks during our relationship, got drunk at a pub, and made out with a rando. I had virtually no guilt because I thought he deserved it. Looking back it is my biggest regret because I handled my anger at him in a disgusting and skeezy way, but you live and you learn I suppose."
