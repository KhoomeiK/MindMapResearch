mentalhealth,fln37hp,t3_fpmai3,1585307492.0,For my part I feel happy. I have realised that I can stay home surrounded with family and work and study from home without the stress from the outside world. Also this quarantine is a way to take distance from other family members leaving nearby and which I don't like and it's just awesome i'd love it to last... The problem is that as my mom is bipolar she sometimes finds ways to argue with me and today I really felt upset and tired and I just decided to go to bed and watch a movie..

Does it make decisions and who approves them for example.  I'm particularly interested in medicines cause I do work on the European Medicines Agency as well. I want to look at agency cooperation, for now it's a bit vague but I just want to understand how it works basically"

mentalhealth,filxqgb,t3_f89un5,1582512900.0,"Oh if you ask me there are people who dare asking me how I am doing and I am like what the hell do you expect me to tell you if a pretend ""I'm good"" since most of the time they just reacted the ways you mentioned when I opened up. Like once I was told I'm  a drama queen, I was so shocked like literally I didn't know if I should laugh or cry cause it was too much. My conclusion, some just don't understand, until they're desperate and funnily you'll be the one they'll come to because they will recall how you opened up but won't remember their response and will be like ""I know you can understand"". Others in any case, just forget about them, I've seen so many face expressions believe me I could paint them, like you can't even enter their brain, like either they've never experienced it or are being stable after help and wouldn't be able to understand why you couldn't be the same. And I know that's true cause myself after going to the psychotherapist and feeling better, it really took me to put my case aside to understand the person who is in front of me and who maybe hasn't even started to seek for help or to face her issues.. eventually, if someone speaks this way to me, I  get the message and I've stopped hanging out with these people and listening to their problems, ow yes they also do have problems but there seems to be ok.. I also do understand that anxiety actually stresses people around but that's tricky cause you shouldn't keep it for yourself. Go to seek for help but keep being open about it and if people don't like it well they better stay away. Anxiety is a big deal, you get panicked and have to calm down by yoursel, it's hard, but let's be positive we can work on it ! And there's no drama talking about it!"

bipolar,fhg5cad,t3_f2zdnf,1581558947.0,‚ô•Ô∏è beautiful. My mom is bipo as well and ripped off most of our childhood's pictures... it's tough but you accept once you understand the illness... May he rest in peace
mentalhealth,fhg462v,t3_f2xltz,1581558186.0,"Idk what's wrong with parents mentally when they do this it's really heartbreaking... mines did the same with our rabbits and guinea pigs we had for years like literally our first pets and yes it rips off a part of you as a teen.  I also thought what's the point of having kids and to do that cause it's such a feeling of injustice. Then they play parents like allowing themselves to think or say it's a kid thing to cry over it but they can't understand because they didn't get attached to it and probably they Think that we see animals like toys so that's why it's easier for them to do this....? Still, it's not nice though... I feel you.. I hope you'll find a way to fill this emptiness. Keep him in your heart ‚ô•Ô∏è he knows you have loved him. I hope they'll say sorry at least. If not just don't expect anything else...but express yourself if you need to and even if they don't like it. They may just deny that they've broken your heart cause it's going to be hard to hear what you have to say about your feelings and how they hurt you. Then I'll say try to move on even if it's hard..once you have shared your feelings and made sure they got the message, no need to keep an unhealthy atmosphere for yourself and all of you. Try to write in a diary as well may help to empty your fillings? Good luck!"

mentalhealth,fh6wwji,t3_f1byvd,1581308193.0,"I feel you so bad. I personally have started to acknowledge this issue last year and went to seek for help. I'm doing a master degree and the thought was driving me mad. just imagine I'm doing research so I was constantly questioning everything I do. For sure you should go to seek for help at school counseling. Then analyse what factors may have affected you. Do you remember someone who made you feel this way ? I personally have realised that some family members comparing me to others and judging my field of study played a role in making me feel useless and everything i do and idk but I developed this thought. Then I just kept making life complicated for myself by being kind of perfectionist and this did not help, maybe you are perfectionist and don't accept to see that everything you're asked to do at school is not rocket science and that everybody struggles and not just you? If you do don't worry anxiety also plays a role in making you believe these things. Then I overthink and had to work on negative thoughts and anxiety. So this requires psychotherapy and exercising, but not only. So since I'm not a specialist I strongly invite you to seek for help. I've been working on killing these thoughts through musculation relaxation and breathing exercises which help you to be present and relaxe when you have negative thoughts which make you panic. But it's also about starting to take distance from negative people. This is a short and quick answer but I understand you so bad. Maybe your case is different but I hope it's still been useful. Good luck and take care of yourself! You're not stupid, many factors prevent you from being productive and focused and you can work on that! It's a process trust me, just take up the journey."
AskMen,ffmccvz,t3_eu2ixr,1580052346.0,"You shouldn't have and you did well cause it shows you can control yourself and you need more to be brought to this point. I would never encourage anyone to hit but I know sometimes we wish we did so. But I guess we don't do it when we know the person is not worth it, I mean some people deserve being hit like hell but hitting them would just stimulate their animal side who wishes this to happen or just you have these people who have issues with anger and any reaction puts them in defence and attack mode. The wise one leaves it there even if you have it down the throat I'd say"

AskReddit,ffjuumy,t3_eu05la,1580007581.0,"By stopping to think that there's such a thing as great if you look at history. How do you define greatness? So when was America great ? Were we even born to know? What do you call greatness? Does it include everybody? Since it's unlikely then there's no such a thing  I guess... The slogan should be changed. People are trapped in their imaginations because this slogan gets them emotional so now people think they have a duty that is to make a country  great again. It keeps people alert and stimulates their brain and gets  the mad people to do stupid things to feed their frustrations, but still, most people will think it's ok because there's a cause to fight for and it's greatness."
AskReddit,ffjrans,t3_etcyd6,1580004881.0,"Men should start a revolution to get over all the pressure society puts on them, stuffs like real men don't show their emotions blabla. The expression of emotions is key I would say. Learning to share problems, but that's no it. People need to learn how to listen and to know what to do to help their friends when they need help. 

It's easier to help at uni because you can just tell teachers and counselling is free, but still most  of the time people don't share their issues so sometimes you don't even see anything, but I think we can all be receptive to some signals with time and if we don't it's because life is easier when you play the blind or the deaf.

The key is to talk, the more you talk the more people realise we're all humans and all have issues and that we can learn to deal with them, like stress for example or excessive thoughts, but that starts with talks and seeing a psychotherapist. Easy to say I know but you can help a friend to see one and support him by accompanying him.

People who are not doing well just compare themselves to others who look all good and for them to understand and even acknowledge that we all have issues is impossible, but we're not all the same and some need assistance to do the first step. The earlier we intervene the better. The more we wait the more dark thoughts grow bigger and bigger and then sometimes it's too late unfortunately.

Don't expect anything in return but also never give it all and never assist anyone with everything because you're not helping that person this way neither. 

Lastly and again, we can't save the world but we all can do sth at our level, tiny things that can help, often it starts with a chat or a smile I guess. But still it's not that easy, communication and listening are arts that if we all mastered we'd be able to help each other better.."
