Psychosis,fkyqmue,t3_fkj956,1584654116.0,"There are many factors such as infection, age, and meds just as another commenter has mentioned. To me it sounds like what hospital folk call ‚ÄúICU psychosis.‚Äù Basically, if you‚Äôre in the ICU (or pretty much any other unit in the hospital) for a long time, you‚Äôre not getting much sleep. You might not have a window, you might not be able to move very well, there are a lot of noises and beeping, and there‚Äôs a bunch of nurses sticking you with needles all the time. It can be very disorienting and eventually become scary.

I recently just witnessed a case of ICU psychosis. He had old age, was in the hospital for a long time, and he had many nurses coming in to help treat him (but he didn‚Äôt know that they were trying to help him). He would yell ‚ÄúHelp me help me!‚Äù All day long. Every day. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think he had any family. At least not any that I got to see. 

Your mother is very lucky that she has you, even if she doesn‚Äôt realize. Hopefully the doctors can figure this out. What‚Äôs important is that you support her when she gets released from the hospital (and ofc now too but that will be hard with the coronavirus). After she gets mentally better, she might feel embarrassed or ashamed. Be there for her and comfort her. Let her know that she is still the same person and that experiencing ICU psychosis (or whatever the doctors determine it to be) does not make her weak.

Psychosis,fk9oue0,t3_fgxs1k,1583980328.0,"I have this too. Attenuated psychosis syndrome is basically mild psychotic symptoms that are below the threshold of being considered ‚Äúfrank psychotic symptoms.‚Äù These include mild/infrequent hallucinations, delusions, and bouts of disorganized thinking/speech. With this condition, you are still aware that something is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and can get help.

Thankfully, only around one third of patients with this syndrome convert to schizophrenia (within two years, which is the length of most studies). According to the two year studies, about one third of patients will still have attenuated (mild) symptoms and impairments (which may include social and cognitive impairments). The other third will supposedly fully recover with no impairments and no/minimal remaining symptoms. I am in a study at Columbia University for young adults and  adolescents with attenuated psychosis syndrome so that‚Äôs why I know the statistics.

Genetic risk factors (parent or sibling with schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder, or other psychotic disorder) and environmental risk factors (smoking weed, stress, pulling all-nighters, emotional trauma, and even maternal illness when you were in utero) can significantly increase your risk of transitioning to schizophrenia. Cognitive and functional decline are symptomatic predictors of conversion (obviously the greater the decline the bigger the risk). 

As for things to do to minimize your chances of developing schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, NUMBER ONE BEST THING TO DO IS TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. A study was done on the effects of cardio exercise on symptoms of teenagers with attenuated psychosis syndrome. Cognition, anxiety, and symptoms improved (especially cognition, and remember, decline in cognition is one of the biggest symptomatic predictors of conversion so if you can stop the decline, your chances of full recovery increase). Go to therapy to get help with possible trauma, stress, social issues, ..., etc. Keep your mind active by learning new things and constantly problem solving (btw, apparently the brain training apps don‚Äôt really have benefits in real life so do other things). Start eating healthier and take at least 1000mg of omega-3 fatty acids (you can get this from fish oil, but make sure the amount of omega-3 is 1000mg not the fish oil). There is evidence that omega-3 can improve brain function and also support recovery in ultra high risk individuals (that‚Äôs what we are called). 
Lastly, create a social support group. They can help you in so many ways. This part is necessary (in my opinion) in staying healthy and your people can help keep you accountable for your health choices.

The studies I have mentioned are all valid and can be easily found with a few quick searches. If you have any questions about what I said or if you want to know my personal experience for reference, just dm me and I‚Äôd be happy to chat.

I wish you the best of luck!!"
