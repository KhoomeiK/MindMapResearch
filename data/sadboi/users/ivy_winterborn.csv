For sheet music books I'd recommend the first suzuki volume and (even if it's for children) the sassmannshaus (it's in german, though). Also, B. Barber scales books are very useful to learn different scales. They get you to read the alto clef.
To begin learning scales I guess it's recommended to do the c-major scale when starting on the c-string, g-major on the g-string, d-major on the d-string, and as long as you can't shift positions leave the a-string out. And only practice scales for one octave.

Knowing where to place your fingers without a teacher appears a bit difficult. Maybe you can use a tuning device or maybe there are good online tutorials. Same goes for using the bow correctly. The problem here is that you need to learn how to hold the bow and how much pressure you need to put on each string to make it sound right. You can practice the pressure on the empty strings.

It messes up your dopamine, serotonine, endorphine and noradrenaline. As soon as you come down you feel the urge to go on consuming because it feels good. 
As for MDMA, there's the fact that MDMA does not only supress the reuptake of serotonine but it also provides your brain with it. Massive consumption of MDMA leads to severe depression and other mental health issues because your brain stops producing necessary neurotransmitters. So to feel good you need to consume more. 
Adding to that, your cardiovaskular system and your central nervous system gets fucked over, too. Plus MDMA gets dissipated by your liver and kidneys which causes other health issues when consumed too much.

Just make sure you can still turn you left arm inwards enough, you need that ability to properly play the C string. 

As for the bowing on the viola: I'm not sure it will emprove your bowing on the violin. On the violin the bowing is much more delicate. In the viola you have to work it. The violin needs more ""feel"" (not sure how to put it). I am only a violist. I don't know how to play the violin properly. But I just got myself a violin last week and I'm just playing around with it and I feel it's really different. It's more subtle. And I have to be super careful with the bow to not make it screech."
Viola,ffqi8mq,t3_eunb0t,1580135330.0,"I think one of the differences no one tells you about is the strength you need to play the viola. With the violin, you can make the strings sound with little effort (not saying it's easy to play the violin). But for a viola you need about double of the strength you need for a violin to make it sound right. Gravity is your friend. The strings also need to be pressed down a lot harder (looking at you, flagolets). 
Plus the distances between you fingers are wider (depends a lot on the size of the viola).
The alto clef reading just takes practice. 

So long story short: same same, but different. But you provably get used to it quickly if you are proficient ob the violin. I would advise to get a teacher for bow techniques and to figure out the strength you need to make it sound right."

If you eat 1200kcal a day you'll lose weight. Add some excessive exercising and you'll lose more. You can go down to 900kcal a day but the feeling of hunger will be ugly.

Can you up that to 1000 pounds within the next 12 hours?

Viola,f2npaf3,t3_dduqtc,1570318415.0,"Stretch your left arm in a relaxed way, palms up. Grab your left thumb with you right hand and pull lightly downwards (make sure it doesn't hurt). Repeat. 
Stand next to a wall and put your left palm flat on the wall, arms outstretched, turn your upper body to the right side. You can also lean the length of you arm outstretched against the wall (shoulder against wall) and rotate to the left.

relationship_advice,f27jktm,t1_f27hmm6,1570039669.0,"At least you'll have a good time until you get dumped for lying. Might as well be a few years. Or you just never say how many there were at all. As long as you don't keep a log of your hookups no-one will ever find out. 

The point here is that it is absolutely ridiculous to dump someone because of their past sexual life. It's not like OP had murdered a child or something. 

I already stated that lying is usually the worse option, but in this case it's simply necessary because a lot of men are just insecure. 

Imagine an arachnophobic sitting on your sofa. There's a tiny spider on the wall behind him. What do you do? Do you yell ""spiiiiideeeeer!"" or do you nicely ask this person to just go to the kitchen for a sec so you can, while the person is gone, get rid of the spider? Exactly, you choose the less stressful option for the other person. 

So why would you tell a man you effed a gazillion of guys before you met him or do you divide the number by three and deduct 4 to not upset the other person? As long as you aren't STD-ridden it just doesn't matter how many blokes you shagged before you met the one. It's completely irrelevant. It doesn't change your character, it doesn't change ypur vajayjay, it probably even makes you better between the sheets (practice). 

So, do I think it's okay to lie about stupid, irrelevant things? Yes. Yes, I do."
relationship_advice,f27fnzj,t3_dcaccm,1570037167.0,"Usually I'm all for being honest, but on this topic... OP, you just LIE about the number. 37 is probably too much for most guys to handle because they will feel like you've seen it all and they might lose in direct comparison (which is obviously also the reason why the virginity myth was invented). 
Guys don't like competition when it's about their dong. They need to know that they're still the most potent manly man you've ever met with the best and biggest and most beautiful knob that exists in this world. 

As long as you don't find that guy who is self-assured enough to just know he's awesome and not endangered in his manlyhood if you slept with more than 4 guys, you lie. 

Ps: ""i can't remember"" is a bad answer, too. ;)"
AskReddit,f27cqnp,t1_f279jl9,1570035313.0,Thank you very much.

AskReddit,f277tmt,t1_f277cu1,1570032401.0,Hm. But do you agree with me that this is a very specific behaviour that is far from common behaviour?
AskReddit,f27691l,t1_f275vio,1570031488.0,"Because it sounds like you find it creepy to be chatted up by a woman who does not fit your taste / beauty standards. And that she, oblivious to her own unattractiveness, has the audacity to think that someone as ugly as her even stands the slightest chance to get with a handsome demi-god as yourself really just insults you. 

Am I getting this right?"

fat,f1uog8i,t1_f1tbngr,1569761454.0,"The thing with starving yourself is that you see immediate results, and quite quickly. And yes, you have to do a lot of sports to keep the weight off, because if you starve yourself, your body is having none of it and will try to hold on to every calorie it gets. It's fucking up your metabolism beyond all reason. Once you start doing that it gets irreversible at some point. 

And about the beauty thing: wow, you're shallow. Like, tremendously shallow. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder and not every fit person is beautiful on the outside and not every fat person is ugly on the outside. And personality does go a longer way than you say. There's people who are super hot and pretty on the outside but their personality makes them fugly. 
And there's people who are less than perfect on the outside and their personality makea them super beautiful. 

>Having a good personality and making good nutrition and fitness goals or having a decent personality but looking so but ugly that most people won't look twice at you.


Being fit and making good nutritional choices does not give you a good personality btw. It takes a lot more to be a decent human being.
And fat =/= ugly."

I work with highly mental ill people and I call them out on a-holery all the time. Because even if you are mentally ill, the basic rules of curtesy and decency still apply to you. 
Of course I understand if someone who's suffering from a psychotic episode rn isn't empathethic. But this is a special condition. 

So definitely NTA. Your sis sounds like she's making excuses to be rude."
