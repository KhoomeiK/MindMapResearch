This is a difficult concept for some people to grasp but,

Every $100 million GDP that we lose essentially means that someone will die unnecessarily. Not to mention the impact of will have on quality of life.

Every trillion dollars we lose from our economy being completely shut down is equivalent to losing 10,00 American lives. 

Leaving the economic closed just indefinitely is not a solution. We need heard immunity unless someone's going to come up with a vaccine sooner than expected.

The virus is also arguably much more widespread and much less deadly than we previously thought. Given that many people are asymptomatic and antibody tests have indicated that some cities have populations with a third already showing antibodies, its possible we are killing people and destroying business without reason.

Not to mention Sweden has had virtually the same percent of their population die from Coronavirus than the United states has. They havent even bothered to close restaurants or put any restrictions on business. They've left people to do as much social distancing as they feel is necessary."
