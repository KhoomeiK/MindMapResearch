Then once they are calm and relaxed they are no longer stressed with the separation and they can stay quietly without the need for immediate reward of release But in the beginning the quick release reinforces what you are asking of them. Thats why I found baby gates helpful so u are close to be able to be wuick to release as soon as they are quiet . Once they understand whining doesn’t get them anywhere you can start working on timing 15 minute daily alone time exercises to frequently reinforce you return when u leave, increase separation time over time.

Fibromyalgia,fqug1tg,t3_gkxu14,1589658350.0,Fibro is not degenerative so there is no damage to the nerves. Magnesium is good for your joint lubrication it helps them move better and people with fibro have joint pain so it helps. There is no sign of inflammation from fibro but inflammation can be caused by other things or injuries too much activity or too little and many find anti inflammatories help (though i do not find them helpful) its basicly trying to eliminate anything you can to keep things moving easier and with least amount of pain possible by managing symptoms as there’s no cure to the problem

Continue until you can successfully seperate without whining and then put her in another room or her crate for 15 minutes at a time and slowly increasing. Also leave the hpuse for fifteen minutes leaving her alone so she gets used to the idea that you come back. And start crate training, iys very effective and they feel safe in a small space when alone. Mine was crated when alone for the first year or so but now she just chills in my bed or where ever she wants. And dont cave on the whining. They will either learn if they whine long enough you let them out OR if they are quiet and calm they get out. The choice is ypurs ;)"

Its a diagnosis via process of elimination and there are many things to rule out first which is why it takes so long but the rhumotologist is the last step of diagnosis as my dr was sure it was fibro but can only write “query fibro” the clinical diagnosis comes from the rhumo.  They can usually detect if its arthritis via blood work from your dr but if the bloodwork is normal it took a bit longer till i saw a rhumo as we were ruling outveverything my dr could do first. The rhumo wants me to get an mri to be sure its not spodyoarthritis as that can often look like fibro and is s type of arthritis that doesn’t show up on bloodwork. Have you had your feet looked at? Flat feet can cause knee pain may want to first rule out irrhotics or physio... my knees were terrible and painful and not from my fibro, but once i had knee pain i used them less and less which made them weak and hurt more. I coukd barely walk and the dr told me to do squats and i thought he was being a jerk but when i went to physio they said the same thing and squats really helped.

Fibromyalgia,fnwvcrj,t1_fnwsk1c,1587326182.0,"Unfortunately where i live we have a massive dr shortage. No one i know has a dr, they all have to use walk in clinics. Im lucky to have a dr i can book apts with. He is really good. I live in canada, any addictive medications (pain anxiety fatigue) they do not prescribe for anything chronic. Ive seen phycatrists and cant even get anxiety meds. I agree with the logic but unfortunately we must suffer through. I really appreciate you commenting to try to help! Honestly sometimes what i need most is connection through this community. Thanks :)"
Fibromyalgia,fnv6x8v,t1_fnuxsvc,1587282335.0,"Ive looked into everything had all the blood work though not sure about carnitine, ive never heard of that, ill check with my dr to see if it was screened and included in all my various blood work, thanks:)"
Fibromyalgia,fnv26np,t1_fnv1sl9,1587277819.0,I think i fight it too much. My husband recommends i just sleep the day away when that happens but i find it scary to sleep my life away.  if i just let go and gave into it and id be more likely to have a better tomorrow. Instead of sleeping i lay there all day unable to do anything wishing i was sleeping. a bit ridiculous really but it scares me
Fibromyalgia,fnv0a3g,t1_fnuyvdw,1587276134.0,Thanks ive been tested. My iron was a little low but levels recovered with  iron supplement snd has since maintained even though i dont take them anymore (i eat more iron rich veggies that may also be keeping my levels good) . Thyroid looks fine too... .. i hope you are feeling better now! No anemia here tho
Fibromyalgia,fnuwhpl,t1_fnugpye,1587272972.0,Yes every time .  There is nothing for him to help me with. We tried all the anti depressants... all.of.them... thats all he has to offer. Just learning to cope and this company of this page sure helps me feel like im here :)
