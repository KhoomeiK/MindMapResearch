Personally, I think that having a green burial is actually one of the most selfLESS things you can do in death. It's better for the environment, it's cheaper for your family, safer for morticians, and it's what humans have done for all of human history up until the American Civil War."

I remember a lot of funeral services from that side of the family and every time, food was a big deal. 

I know I've been to two funerals on my dad's side, but I only remember one - a modern Irish wake. The only people who made or brought food were me and my sisters.

My family kind of does our own thing and we can't afford things like funeral homes and such. 

My dad's (secular) funeral will be paid for by the military, and he'll get a cremation and free niche.... His wake will definitely just be my sisters and I getting drunk and wishing for a grave to piss on, but that says far more about my dad than his ""culture."" 

My (white) grandpa's funeral will be a lot more heartfelt. Lutheran service with a pre-paid casket and burial plot and the whole nine yards, with a rightful hero's military memorial.

It was a big ""oh!"" moment for me. I have a few relatives on various levels of the spectrum, so I knew I had to teach him differently. We got the project done, and in the mean time I learned a lot about him. 

He switched from a physics degree to acting. He wanted to be an astronaut, but apparently ASD (or aspergers, as was his diagnosis) disqualifies a person from space. He's apparently far better at math than I am, as he was doing well in calculus before he switched.

He said he found love for acting, especially voice acting, through the work of Robin Williams. Apparently taking local improv classes was helping him tremendously with social skills. He's won at least one inprov competition, and he does professional acting work with a local theatre company that specifically hires people with both physical and mental disabilities. (I haven't applied yet, but I want to, they do cool stuff. I qualify because of my depression etc.) 

I talked to him the other day. He's worried about his high-risk mom, and about finances since he contributes to his household. When we finished talking, he told me he loved me. I love him too. A lot. 

My point in telling you all of this is that with your support, your kid is going to go really far. Someday you may see him on TV, calculating weather patterns in real time, wearing a green tie as a joke.

I decided to take my meds a little earlier than usual and started getting dressed, which took a good twenty minutes. I eventually emerged from my room and sat down to write out a grocery list. 

My roommate made a comment that caught me off guard. ""Those meds really seem to be working for you."" ""What?"" ""I mean, you seem to be functioning pretty well now."" ""Oh. Yeah, I suppose you're right.""

Going from barely able to figure out pants and socks to being able to concentrate on a grocery list made it pretty clear: my ADHD is very, very real."

I have been through some shit that has made me a lot less physically affectionate than I used to be, but I still like hugs. 

I've learned to be a lot more conscious about consent to any form of touch, so I've started asking people if I can hug them. I get a little disappointed if they say no, but I definitely understand and I'm not offended. It's like being left hanging for a high five. It's a bummer, but nbd.

At camp as a little kid, the councillors would say goodnight by asking, ""do you want a hug, high five, or [ET touch](https://images.app.goo.gl/EqWbFzWRPdQPtvuS8)?""

However, if you are moving around, you are a potential vector for disease. I know you've been self-isolating for 3 weeks, (Good job!) but the second you go to the store or stop for snacks and gas, you're potentially exposing yourself and therefore others. 

Consider for a moment how bad you would feel if you picked up the virus at some Idaho gas station and brought it to your family....

The App they are using is **Microsoft Teams**. (If you have a mac like me, it's not available in the app store, but you you can google it and it says ""Download on any device"" so, you're good.)

The reminder call (from ""Private Number"") that you usually get two business days prior to your appt will ask you if you want a phone or video call. If you want video, they'll email you a consent form and an invitation for your appointment. If you miss the reminder call, they'll leave a voicemail with the main number, which connects you to the front desk check in, who will notify the appropriate floor to call you back (which took 10-15 minutes for me). If you see different people on different floors, you'll need to get a *separate call and invitation from each floor.*

I will warn you, I was told ""I will send the emails right after we get off the phone, should be less than a minute from now."" I still haven't received the emails ten minutes later. (Not in my spam folder either.) If I haven't received the emails in the next 20 minutes, I'm calling them back...

So this is not a fear question but a hypothetical space-physics question: if the comet just *happened* to be going at the right angle to have a *chance* at hitting us earthlings, how would it affect earth? And/or how would earth affect it? Like, would it break apart in the atmosphere? If so, would it disintegrate into a beautiful firework or would it be big scary chunks too?  

Side questions closer to reality: if the sun has the potential to break it apart, would it be the sun's gravity doing that or some other...star power? If it is gravity with the potential to break it apart would that same gravity have the potential to drag it into the sun itself? And if it *did* get pulled into the sun, how would the sun react, if at all?
