worldnews,fjvjxy3,t1_fjugdxv,1583627942.0,"So I used to be a Christian Zionist and I stayed in Israel for a while. A lot of people who live there have relatives who were alive during the Holocaust. It's not the only time that Jews have been killed for being Jews, it's just the worst one. When the country was founded it was right after that, surrounding counties invaded, Israel prevailed. Up until 67 they were a friendless nation constantly expecting to be invaded loaded onto trains and killed. After that the US got interested. They had a lot of wars, like look at the number of wars they had, and I mean the idea of setting up a state for European people in the middle East is pretty fucked up but these people didn't create their religion they were born into it. In their minds they were fighting the Nazi camp guards. Never again isn't just theoretical for these people. 

Anyway when I was there it was right after they put up the fence, I met people who had been in a restaurant when it exploded. Or in a bus when it exploded, some had scars, all had PTSD. The fence/wall means Palestinians are locked in, when the Russians emigrated to Israel they didn't need the Palestinians to do the menial labour and they just locked them in an open air prison. 

Someone asked a woman who was in a restaurant when it exploded if she could forgive them, she said she could never forgive the arabics. Not something I felt I could argue with. 

Once the fence went up the number of suicide bombs dropped dramatically. 

I think they are like this because they're afraid if they aren't tough they will all die."

todayilearned,fjpv053,t1_fjpgwvt,1583561342.0,"I assumed the point of calling black people in America African American was to remind everyone that the vast majority of black people in America are descended from slaves. The whole point of affirmative action was to try and undo the impact of policies like red lining. The result however is that resentment towards affirmative action became the easiest way for racists to remain in the mainstream conversation. Regardless of your views on affirmative action and the hardship endured by those who are white and African it must be noted that the race that was once enslaved still hasn't recovered from the damage done at least when you look at income inequality. It's not just in America though, in Europe we are often worse, we just have less black people to be racist about. Check out skin bleaching, it's a thing all across the world, people really want to be white, and as someone who works with a lot of Indians in tech it's not because we are smarter or better in any way. It's for the save reason the British were able to destroy the Irish language or Bosnians converted to Islam under the ottomans.

todayilearned,fi33o9z,t1_fi32p87,1582099460.0,"I think a large part of the reason that men kill themselves more than women is because men are taught that they should be prepared to die for their country, their family, stuff they believe in. This idea gets drilled in even if there isn't actually a war. Men are also expected to be above average, act beyond the call of duty when it comes to career and the battlefield. You need to be John Wayne even if you are in a conference giving a presentation. These are hold overs from when we used to kill each other a lot more, we don't anymore but we haven't updated things. 

Women on the other hand need to survive because if they don't who will pay enough attention to their children to look after their needs. The men can't do that because they are too busy trying to somehow die for their country in peace time by working themselves to death. 

We should stop telling our boys they need to fight, stand up and be heroes. Standards they will never live up to that lock them into a success or die trying mentality.

AskReddit,fgi20tf,t1_fgh1wgg,1580801922.0,"India used to be a very rich country under other empires but once the British invaded they structured the economy so that they would no longer compete with British industry, that people who have to sell their land to the British to pay taxes and everyone would end up with debts they couldn't pay off. The end result was they went from 1/4 of the world's manufacturing to 1/50. It's a credit to India that it's recovering from British occupation as well as it did. Many other nations did not.

Unfortunately it is not a smooth ride, right now in India there are a lot of farmers killing themselves by drinking pesticides, they are in so much debt they can't escape, climate change has made water really hard to get. Also the loans available to farmers require that they plan a crop they can't eat so the investors money is protected even if the farmer and their family are starving.

If Britain invaded we would be fucked, having said that, that doesn't mean we wouldn't fight back. My dad was called to barracks and given orders to go to the border during the troubles. They gave the British an ultimatum that if they didn't stop the police from killing Catholics they would invade. Now talk about David and Goliath, one of the strongest armies of the world against one of the weakest. Then the British army was sent in, and they shot unarmed protestors in what became the triggering event. People stopped caring that if you got involved they weren't just going to come for you but your family too. It was brutal, and cruel.

On top of that you can only get weapons like shotguns and small caliber rifles that don't reload automatically. We also have a low population, small country and so less organised crime. 

However over the years organised crime has become more of a problem as we have more money and our location is useful to traffickers. Recently we've had people killed in brutal ways trying to emulate the Narcos in Columbia and Mexico people see on TV. These are all young men who are killing other young men involved in these real dangerous game. 

In the North of the island, the provisional IRA would give drug dealers warnings and then they would kneecap them if they refused to stop. As a result there isn't as much drug activity in the North as in the South. I saw a film about the autodefensas recently, a Mexican vigilante group that started up to defend the people from the cartels and ended up getting involved in drugs themselves. 

I've shot guns once or twice I'd really love to try again, feels pretty powerful and I enjoy the skill involved in being accurate. 

However when I see a sign like that I can't get over the fact that America is THE first world country and its so unsafe that every person needs to carry a gun.

Took this from Wikipedia, read the study a while ago, it's really heartening to see that there is a way to solve this problem. One really interesting thing I found was that while kids who born years before the basic income did better once the basic income was introduced kids who were born later did better again hinting at a lasting effect.

When I was a kid I did really badly at school which confused everyone because they thought I was a smart kid, pretty much universally every teacher blamed me for the problem. I was really into computers since before I could even read, I spent as much time as I possibly could on computers, and yet even when I went to college studying only Computer Science I barely scraped a pass most of the way through until I dropped out in the last year due to illness. I didn't do much better in employment, I did great in the interviews because I knew the stuff but after a while each job became dreadfully dull and I couldn't make myself do what I needed to do to succeed. I was really worried that I'd never achieve this potential everyone kept telling me I had, that all the promise was skin deep, it was all a performance with no actual smarts beneath. I got into motivational speakers and pushed myself really hard to achieve all my dreams, and I burned out really really hard. Finally I went and got help, I did some research on what was going on with me and discovered that ADHD wasn't something people made up, it was real and what's more I have it. Finally all the promise I was supposed to have is being reflected in my actual performance in this job with Ritalin. 

It's a relief but at the same time I can't help wondering why the fuck did no one think of this? The reality is they had no idea what caused it and they blamed me cause I was a kid and I couldn't defend myself. No one thought, hey this is weird I should research why this kid isn't doing well, they all just shrugged and came up with the easiest solution, something that may not have fit all the facts but it was easy to understand or at least easy to say. I was lazy, lots of potential but does not apply themselves. Years later I know that a LOT of people had that written on their report cards because it's the most lazy explanation for poor grades a teacher can give. 

Let's not blame the teachers either, that would just be another form of lazy thinking that really comes down to [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html). Let's be really ambitious with what we can achieve in our society rather than who we can blame for the failures we see."
