A very cheap upgrade for a dob is modding it with an azimuth setting circle and grabbing a digital angle finder or ""inclinometer"". Finding the alt az on an app on your phone, line up the az circle on the dob mount and the proper angle for altitude, and you're there.

We bought manulife, we're unsure if we should wait to see if sunwing cancels flights, or just take the refund and file a claim with manulife. I'm not familiar with any of this chit. First big trip for me."
keto,fky76zw,t3_fl7ni6,1584642981.0,"Hello all, I apologize for the long post. I have been reading quite a bit in the last couple weeks. I typically get overwhelmed when diving into things I do not understand well (which is almost everything haha). I have a little experience with nutrition, I was heavily into ""bodybuilding"" in my late teens and early twenties with moderate/great success.

My girlfriend made the personal decision a couple months ago that she wanted to start taking better care of her body, and to lose weight. I supported her, but maintained my eating habits (which are not the best and unhealthy at times, but adequate for maintaining my body mass). About a week ago I decided to make the decision that I need to start taking better care of myself. I am not over weight, and have no intention of losing weight. I am 6' 190lbs give or take (15% BF). My motivation is to kick sugar and carbs, which I know I have a very unhealthy relationship/addiction with. I have also struggled with mental health issues in my life, and hope that a nutrition plan not relying on carbs and sugar with plentiful micro nutrients will help sustain my mood and perspective.

We started a ""keto"" oriented diet 4 days ago now. We do not currently have a food scale, but I've been doing the best I know how to watch carbs, fats, and protein. I estimated our carb intake around 40g per day so far, but I recently read about NET carbs and carbs relationship to fibre. The whole process has been a bit overwhelming, and my girlfriend has been relying on me to manage most of it. I've done the calculator for us both, and I am much more determined to enter ketosis than she is. I understand the goal is to maintain 20g a day or less, but at this point this is a learning experience for us both, and I am eating healthier now then I have in years. If it takes a short time to get my body into ketosis, and there is a short learning curve, that is perfectly acceptable to me.

The few questions I have:

\-How healthy is a general diet like this if the person is in fact not entering ketosis? (I love the foods, it was so much easier to transition to low sugar and carbs than I thought).

\-When in the initial phases, is it better to take less supplements then more, to see how ones body reacts? (Omega 3, multi, vit A & D, etc)

\-In terms on electrolyte imbalance, I've been coping with (per day) a cup of broth, one avocado, mio, salted foods, are there anymore inexpensive ways to deal with it? With the state of things, we are protecting our finances, so I haven't run out and bought a magnesium/potassium supplement. I've also been drinking about a gallon of water a day. (The only side effects we've both experienced is minimal brain fog and moderate diarrhea in the am).

The staples we've incorporated into the food plan so far have been: eggs, egg whites, chicken, ground turkey, bacon, fish, cheese, berries (black and raspberries), broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, snap peas, cucumber, lettuce, coleslaw, and avocado.

I do apologize for the long post, and I am sure with a lot more searching I could find the answers. I have just been overwhelmed, and the last thing I want to do is sabotage my girlfriends weight loss, compromise our immune systems, or any other physical side effects (nutrient deficits) that can occur with an unbalanced nutrition plan. I have never been good with the ""details"" of nutrition, I have relied (maybe foolishly) on my intuition from my lifting days and knowing how my body reacts to quantities of foods, duration between meals, and maybe ignorance.

In my mind, the next steps are to bite the bullet and buy a food scale. So we know exactly what we are putting into our bodies, and the exact numbers involved with macro/micros. Other then that, we have been cheating a little. We switched from white or cane sugar to monk fruit for our coffee in the morning. But we have still been using around 2 teaspoons of half and half cream for our coffee (made the transition easier), switching to butter could solve that for me. Other then that just being more detailed oriented, and planning my days to get to 20g or less. It has also been a learning experience with regards to ""healthy"" foods and the quantity of carbs. We've looked at plenty of things and thought ""yeah, this is healthy!"" only to see a portion or two blows our carb goals for the day.

If you have made it this far, thank you! Any anecdotal opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated. I am truly excited to enter ketosis, I just need to maintain discipline and continue educating myself to get there. I have always been drawn to eating healthy and long fasting, but have lacked the discipline necessary. For my mental well being, I am motivated to have ""control"" over my urges and temptations in nutrition, and as well as in every day living and life choices."

Another annoying issue is freezing, mid game it can freeze for 1-3 seconds. Opening the map and closing is slow as well. Looking forward to better optimization, or maybe they knew the series x was coming out so it's geared towards higher system specs?"

telescopes,fk0wf3g,t1_fk0uyas,1583767637.0,"To be honest, the only experience I have with quality zooms is reading tons of opinions online. I have an inexpensive sky mentor 8-24mm. From my reading, I would be comfortable buying any of them. The only one I may not consider is the pentax, because of the AFOV. I've gone the route of fixed eyepieces, but that may change. 

If I were you, head on over to cloudynights, and start reading opinions. Feel out what you want, ie 8-24mm, combination with barlow, budget, etc. If you're close to star parties, or an astronomy club, maybe check it out and ask any of the members their opinions. Maybe some of them own them. 

When you're ready to buy, check out classifieds. They pop up periodically, sometimes for a steal. The baader sells used for a decent price, so you could always go that route, and when you're ready for a more premium one find the one you like, and then sell the baader. Mark 3s and 4s are easy to find used for a good price."
