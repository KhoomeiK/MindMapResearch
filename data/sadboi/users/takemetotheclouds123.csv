52book,fq7y3qp,t1_fq7gamb,1589154578.0,"I think it’s pretty clear when an adult calls a *child* handsome and touches them while he is sleeping it’s big red flags. 

Along with the fact that Holden

- runs away from the encounter incredibly shaken

- is obsessed with keeping children innocent (like when he wants to beat up the person who graffitied profanity where kids could see it), 

- is so attached to Jane (who was also sexually abused by her stepfather), 

- doesn’t know how to go back to a time where he is still an innocent child (like when he pinches his sister’s butt while trying to be affectionate as if he doesn’t know how to be appropriately)

- dissociates (when he’s telling his brother to not let him float away on the street)

- is suicidal 

It is clear that Holden is traumatized. Maybe I would give you the benefit of the doubt and say I don’t know for sure if it was Mr. A, though the red flags I mentioned are huge and waving right at you.

Thinking he was reading into the encounter too much is just what people who have no idea what it is like to be traumatized say. It’s a language you either haven’t learned or are ignoring."

The teacher who assaulted him is also implied to have assaulted the student who killed himself. The entire novel is focused on how Holden struggles between childhood and adulthood, and what else could so forcefully kick a kid to the other side other than violence and sexual coercion?

His apathy is alienation from others. His crappy behavior is yes, him being an ass, but also due to a distorted view on the world from the abuse and other trauma, like his brother dying and his parents not being there for him. He’s mourning the loss of his innocence.

Sex abuse greatly affects a child, so the narrative is going to be affected by it as well, even if Holden doesn’t want the doctor he is talking to to know it.

He’s traumatized. Not an asshole."
