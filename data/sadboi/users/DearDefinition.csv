So...Im not sure why we are all seen as 'irredeemable' and 'forever abusive' for something we also cant control.

BPD,fpgev2x,t1_fpf73z2,1588601275.0,"How is that the wrong definition? It is an illness. GD is sorta related to BD (body dysphoria) and the only symptoms you feel is with dissociation. Thing is, GD separates body from gender. While BD can warp your POV about physical traits and make you feel uncomfortable, like with common EDs, GD will warp your identity and since your gender is often defined as sex- it can go both ways, physical or emotional. Either way, you are feeling weary about your gender- hence gender dysphoria. 


My friend is NB and they are diagnosed with GD, yet they are NB and say they are trans? (which they are)
They dont think about having no body parts, as that would often be seen as impossible. 

Google literally defines it as 'the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex.'

And you dont need to be fully diagnosed by a doctor if you have GD- i have and my friend has, but Ive felt it before I got diagnosed as it is a simple disorder brought on by discomfort both mentally and physically in some cases. Before that, I have thought I was Agender. That was BEFORE I felt uncomfortable with my own body, and wanted to be a transman. 

Pretty sure if you talk about your symptoms with any doctor or therapist, theyll suspect GD- a huge screening process with other illnesses arent required considering all I did was talked about it to be diagnosed and so was my friend. NB or transexual, theyll still consider you such since it is a gender identity other than your biological one. 

Thats why its weird how people say you dont need dysphoria because if you are struggling with gender identity in any way- you kinda have GD. It doesnt matter what it may be.

Sometimes GD will come up again too, sometimes people will never feel it again and it goes away or theyll feel it for the rest of their lives.

I know I have moments where my GD returned and it was psychological, not bio."

And I even stated how trans people cant transition sometimes and how they can still struggle?? SO??? not sure where you are pulling this out from, what the fuck.

GD is GENDER dysphoria, and having GD doesnt obviously mean you CAN transition. I was only defending to GD aspect because you LITERALLY need it, otherwise what 'struggles' are you facing? I mean, if you are fine with your gender and everything- why the hell would you claim yourself as anything else unless its to feel special?

I was pretty calm explaining that too, you are the one freaking the fuck out. I have suffered from GD as well btw, so yes I do fucking know the struggles.

Then tell me why you wanna be trans without dysphoria?
Without dysphoria, it is the same identity as any other stuff and no one has to support trans people if thats the case.

Why are you denying the same science that can credit every trans person and prevent literal deaths from occurring?

Before you say ""gender is a social construct!"" keep in mind age and race are the same kind of 'social construct' as gender. There is science to back up gender, and there is science to back up trans people- it is called dysphori and that is why trans people are not bad people- just ill.

That is also why you can still get help without transitioning, because some cant even transition and GD can go away too- hence, an illness. You can also still have GD sadly even after transitoning.

People literally kill themselves or get killed for having GD and being trans- and you are tryna say its just some special 'identity'? That its just some label?

Also what about trans women?? Trans women also have GD?? Hence why a lot transition or get help?? 

Like sure, call yourself 'genderfluid' or whatever- but I dont have to say its valid or support you because its just an identity as you imply it is. Its just some label like you mentioned."

And their are entire cultures pushing dark skin as the standard, along with other things. Beauty industries are like that, man. Its just history. Have you heard the the foot-thing people would do in China back then? Smaller feet used to be more desirable and theyd do some fucked up things to get small feet.

So if anything, one is a serious disorder where there is a clear biological separation between male and female that benefits how we function- and then theres skin color, where the only thing i see coming outta it is racism and beauty standards. Since, skin color and race arent the same thing- same with culture."
TrueOffMyChest,fp6bhpt,t1_fp4psmd,1588349478.0,"GD is a mental illness and being a race doesnt inherently equal being a skin color (especially when you are mixed race)

See, thats the problem with the stupid trenders. GD is a mental illness but people are out here like WhATS YoUR PrOnOUns and shit like its normal and that gender is just a social construct- when it isnt. Literally, it isnt. 

Lightening your skin color or darkening should be no problem. The people I see who do that literally do not pass as 'black' nor or they trying to be- yet they stil get attacked for it. 

Skin color is just a skin color, we are all equal. If you wanna make your skin lighter, you should be able to. If you wanna make it darker, you should be able to. Its not like it makes you another race if you do so. Being 'white' or 'black' isnt a race- hell, being white or black isnt even a culture in itself.

But then again, its not like the people i see turn themselves 'black' or 'white'.. Just they alter the tones they have."
TrueOffMyChest,fp4orq7,t1_fp4gktr,1588303764.0,"Yeah but literally everything you described can be applied ti gender, ironically enough.
Literally everything.

Personally, I'm not against altering your skin color as long as you dont claim you are literally another race- but these people I see get angry at folks who just wanna make their skin darker and not even in a dark-dark way. 
Hell, they were making fun of black people who werent against a girl doing that and actually helping her- telling them like ""oh theyd do anything for money"" and ""wow youd think hed know racism"" etc etc.


And the same goes to black people themselves, I see THEM get made fun of by their own community for wanting their skin lighter. Sometimes theyd be confused by people like MJ who legit had no choice but to make themselves lighter due to a condition. 
And Albinos, they get killed but thats only in crazy countries in certain communities due to black magic. They do get made fun of in a regular sense though. 
This isnt just black people against this, dont be fooled by my wording. Ive seen my fair share of people be either against or in defense of this. Its just a skin color, after all. 

Personally, i find it more offensive to be fetishized by trans women who claim they dont have GD but talk how 'lesbian' they are and how they supposedly get periods and stuff- like being a women aint fun and games, we are not surface level. We have literal biological traits that separate us from men. 
Same goes to men and gay men, Lord knows how many times ive seen trans men be obsessed with YAOI and the non-existent 'gay culture'.  If its not that then theyd go after the other stereotypes.

People who suffer from GD at least have an explanation, they literally cannot help how they feel. They aint crazy and try to justify the whole gender thing, thy understand their limits and what they can do to help. (for example: not everyone can transition, but there are other healthier ways to cope rather than be in denial and forcing others to cater to you, things that can equally reduce negative feelings)

And in terms of society, gender is more important than skin color. Gender is more biological than skin color and keeps us all in line. A healthy dynamic if we stop feeding the clear stereotypes. 

Dont get me wrong, being a different race affects you physically as well- but like stated, thats race and the people ive seen dont really go out of their way to mimic every aspect like that. (ive seen some but they are a rarity)"

The media may flaunt it like it's everything, but a lot are still repulsed by it- a surprising amount are still like that. 

This, I believe, dampers sex education. Many kids are not being taught that and the culture we have leads to so many toxic mental health dilemmas. What makes that worst is the American Health System costing thousands unlike other countries, meaning so many people are helpless in terms of their mental health due to the cost.

My roommate is one of them, he's a goddamn incel. He gets into gits and doesn't know how to keep his hands off people. Very unstable. Sometimes I worry about him snapping and killing/attacking someone and there's nothing I can do about it. He cant be admitted due to the cost nor get any of treatments due to the cost, he is stuck at a job that doesnt pay him enough an fucks him over even during a pandemic. Top that off with a drinking problem, and well... 

This is a reality of many. Unhealthy people breeding then creating unhealthy children and a lack of proper resources to help them when parents arent there to teach them. 

16 and pregnant. STDs, being preyed on. Drug addiction, drinking problems. Media that flaunts bad news over good news due to ratings. One thing leads to another and by then a hand reaches out to help them a bit too late, them aleady having children- creating another unhealthy cycle.

Need I remind you of all the sexual assault cases as well? I was molested by my brother and I was 14 when I realized that my life wasnt normal.  I lived confused sexually, looking at others talk about toxic mental health traits like it was quirky. Luckily for me but not my sister, she got pregnant at 16 herself so I already knew the dangers of sex- I had to learn about it myself, NOT the heath system. Guess where my sister is? A druggie, she has two kids and a messy relationship with her boyfriend, all the while being obese and wanting to become a famous YouTuber with her daughter.

You think this is uncommon? Its not. Everything is kinda fucked here as we all find excuses that focus on unrelated things- as if THATS gonna fix the problem. We live in a society where we victim-blame and ignore red flags and do NOTHING to help those with mental health problems who are at risk- then wonder why people are going nuts and hurting others, why people support abortions despite ""iTs  MuRdEr"", why people are hurting themselves, why people are becoming sensitive, why this why that. All that as they praise sex and drugs, praise illnesses like GD and depression, praise finding people to blame, etc etc. 

American culture is just fucked like that, man. Sex makes people 'happy', drugs make people 'happy'. It's 'cool' to not care and self-destruct. After all, whadda gonna do? Face reality and hurt yourself at the sight of it? Nah, too much effort and not enough support."

Like yeah I get that sounds pretty obvious.... But... I dont know, it blows my mind how I thought I was the only one and that I was just overreacting. 

But yeah, I understand what you mean. People view it at such face value and I pull my eyelashes out tryna to explain, it drives me NUTS. No its not that simple, no we are all not 'neat' and 'organized' and pictures online dont determine shit, *Karen.*

What sucks most is that its so widespread that when I tried explaining to my friend about it, they first were like ""oh, you mean that <insert stereotype definition here>?"" annd I wanted to crawl into a ball of shame because they didnt seem to understand even after I tried explaining the obsessions and compulsions and just... Ugh. 

i swear... trying to explain to people how I really feel makes me feel like a big drama queen whos off the rails and insane. I hate the stereotypes so much because im 99% theyd view the real deal as just us being 'insane'."

TrueOffMyChest,fos3txo,t1_fos1yur,1588023475.0,"Yeah youre right, though I guess everyone suffers differently. GD is one complex disorder that i wish people would stop putting on a pedestal. These people would like to say ""oh its society's fault! my anxiety and depression are unrelated!!"" even though, I  have never met one single trans person who have not suffered from that. 

Theres also that who science experiment where a dude was made to be a girl as a child but ended up killing himself because he couldnt take it- i dont remember if the doctor even got in trouble for it.

Theres also the 'monsters' (i like to call them that) who think putting kids on puberty blockers and whatnot is A-OK treatment because it lowers their suicidal thoughts- even though suicidal thoughts have a lot of different, less damaging treatments than trying to help them 'transition' later in life when a lot regret transitioning and a lot grow outta it (including myself)

Kinda thankful my trans friends know its an illness and dont act this way.  Be prideful all you want but just obsessing over the non-existent 'gay culture' isnt being 'prideful', its downright weird and not how folks act."

Why would you go around online and say that anyways? If youre just pretending, why are you telling random people online to call you that when no one is gonna care what gender you are and stuff? 

Its all about ""gay culture"" and people who glorify being gay. They dont wanna be NoRmAL and be called straight because /iiick, icky ew! straight ppl bad! /s"

Also, I cant imagine how unstable a transgirl and a lesbian parenthood must be.
