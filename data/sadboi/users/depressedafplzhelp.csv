ptsd,evdfvr7,t1_evdfpn8,1564437259.0,I discussed this with my therapist and she said it may be a good idea to bring him to one of our sessions but he said no and he doesn’t want to. The thing is he really was a good and polite friend before I opened up to him about this...
CPTSD,evdfo17,t1_evdf95g,1564437117.0,Thanks for a quick reply. I cannot agree with you more but he really was a good friend until I opened up to him about this... Do you think he was just hiding his true personality?

selfhelp,eu6xpgr,t3_cf1jcd,1563511777.0,This is how I exactly felt a year ago. I overcame gym anxiety by making gym bros who were willing to correct me and give me tips and tricks.
ptsd,eu50xm4,t3_cemx2h,1563467528.0,Cannot agree with you more. People are abusing words like trigger and PTSD and treat people with actual PTSD and triggers as if we are “horsing around” and being “fussy.”
DepressionRecovery,eu2wvty,t3_cedn7y,1563399966.0,"I cannot agree with this guy more. However, I feel like the society is not ready for the change. It was my sophomore year in university when I decided to open up and share my experiences about my depression and PTSD to my close guy friends. Unlike the speaker in the video, I was not very fortunate to get such positive feedbacks. The responses I got were “gay, pussy, and faggot.” They also told me to “man up and grow a pair” and that they cannot “baby me.” This actually made me to suppress my feelings even more and prevented me from opening up and being my true self, which worsened my depression and PTSD. I wish people to be more accepting regardless of their gender norms someday."

One time, he ni haoed straight at me, and I was like “excuse me?” Then he started bullshitting that he wasn’t talking to me, but I was literally the only asian around him."
