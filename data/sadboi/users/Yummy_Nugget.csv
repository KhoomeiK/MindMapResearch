~PerpetualDick

Hahaha if you are really the one who banned this person then... how do I put this nicely so I don’t get banned?.... you need to use your power a little more maturely. Let me explain why you deserve to now be banned (temporarily) for abuse of power.

First off, you just called someone a “bitch” (excuse my vulgar language) right in front of everyone who will read this post. This is in direct violation of the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities which states that:

1. Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for their co-collaborators. **It’s not appropriate to attack your own users.**...

You have just attacked one of our users for stating their opinion on the matter. They did not attack you by calling you names as you have done. They simply stated the facts of what happened (them getting banned for said amount of time) and then expressed their opinion that they didn’t feel they deserved to be banned for that long (and In response, you expressed that you had reduced the ban time, indicating that you also did not agree that this person needed to be banned for that long).

Furthermore, the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities also states:

8. Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and ***work through education, not punishment.***

You have responded to this person’s opinion by trying to punish them for it instead of just downvoting it like the rest of us. This demonstrates your abuse of power in this situation; you publicly targeted and shamed someone, and the Content Policy clearly states that bullying will not be tolerated.

I hope you understand that I am trying  to keep the Reddit community safe, so I am going to have to report you and I hope that you are able to learn from this experience so that you do not have to make the same mistakes as a moderator in the future. This is not a punishment. This is a learning experience."

I made a lot of friends at the hospital too. And yeah the floor below us was the notorious 6th floor where all of the crazy shit went down and if you did anything remotely concerning they would send you down to the 6th floor where there is nothing to do. But on the 7th floor we could color and play cards and do puzzles. I also was dying to have a pen so I could write on myself because my friends and I designed a puzzle piece tattoo with the words “missing pieces” spelled above and below it. I had to be really sneaky stealing it off of the front desk because if I got caught they could send me to the 6th floor. I had to keep it in my bra because they searched our rooms every day. And when that pen ran out I had to switch it with another pen from the desk which was a huge accomplishment bc they are always watching the desk and there are cameras that apparently don’t get checked often.

I have a lot of random stories from the hospital like when I first got there they made me take out my earrings (bc you could hurt yourself with them) which I didn’t wanna do bc my holes close in like a day so I begged them to find me something I could use instead and they didn’t care so at lunch I picked apart an apple stem until there were two perfectly earring-shaped studs with a nub on one end of each so they wouldn’t fall out.... yeah then my ear holes got infected and my nurse found that out and gave me plastic earrings."

It seems like people with paranoid psychosis say what you just said about the hidden messages a lot and I was wondering how that happens. Like what kinds of things do you see on tv or read that you think are a hidden message? And could you maybe give a hypothetical example or something?"

It’s true though, when Mormons find out someone left the church and now drinks, they often talk about that person as if they are off the rails going crazy shooting up and on their way to hell. It’s ridiculous.

I wish the church leaders would encourage members to be open minded and gain an understanding of things outside of the church.

exmormon,fcsji3r,t1_fcr0beo,1577917815.0,"Thank you. I’ve thought about this a lot in the past actually and I’ve been wanting to be completely honest with my dad and stop hiding things from him about my life (like what I believe, that I have a tattoo, that I wear crop tops, little stuff like that that he does not approve of). I would rather him know and hate it than for me to have to keep hiding it when I don’t even care if he knows.

The only reason I don’t tell him these things though is that I am about to start working for his company. And Mike is rich. So if I don’t take this job, I am stupid. Because I am poor right now and I often can’t afford my meds and I don’t have a car so this job will change the course of my life. I will be able to finally hold a job even though I’m bipolar. It will be my first salary job and I will get paid even when I can’t show up to work because I’m stuck in bed having panic attacks or when I’m depressed and can’t function or focus on my work very well. Mike will not fire me for being bipolar because he cares about me and knows I need this job. The only problem is that now he has leverage over me. If he finds out things about my life that he doesn’t like then it might come to a point where he decides to do something to change it (like firing me or threatening to fire me if I continue) because he thinks he is saving my soul in doing so.

As of right now I’m planning on waiting a year or so to tell him everything so that he can hopefully warm up to my lifestyle a little more. Also I won’t have to use medical marijuana anymore by then because I will hopefully have better anxiety meds by then that won’t put me to sleep during the day. Plus I drink occasionally and that’s illegall until I’m 21 so next year I should be completely fine to tell him I drink and that shouldn’t be grounds for him to fire me since it’ll be legal.

Yeah anyway, the whole thing is kinda complicated and requires a lot of background about me and my parents but I didn’t want my original post to be too long. I just wanted to keep it simple and leave out all the other shit I could complain about as well."
exmormon,fcpuzo7,t1_fcpmm5d,1577872703.0,Oh no you’re fine it’s still applicable to a lot of people and many situations with my parents but there’s jst a little more to the story that I didn’t mention
exmormon,fcpuvqz,t1_fcptglo,1577872635.0,Thanks that’s actually really good advice. And yeah I’m 20 so my parents still try to parent me
exmormon,fcpm1ac,t1_fcphkis,1577867240.0,Oh I know he is trying to protect me. His intention doesn’t change how I feel. He has always had good intentions for me. That doesn’t excuse the abuse I went through or the way he treats me now
exmormon,fcpgh0f,t1_fcpe242,1577862934.0,Yeah I use it for that as well and it’s great. I’m off my meds rn so I am on the verge of a panic attack pretty much every night now
