I was wrong, techincally we can give every name we want but it must not be ridicoulus. If one of 2 parents or the guy at office registering name think that name chosen is ridicoulus,it can become a legal thing

Anyway it seems we are pretty free. But more or less we pick names that always existed before.
We can pick foreign names, names of colours. We cannot pick name of past bad guys (lets say Adolf Hitler). We cannot pick name from fantasy worlds (like Gandalf or topolino, which is Mickey Mouse).
