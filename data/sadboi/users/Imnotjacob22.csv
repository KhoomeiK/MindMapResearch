I dont know like i said I'm not a doctor but i do feel i have a pretty good idea of how my brain functions. But, from what I can tell though, my therapist is a very understanding person and listens to what I have to say so I'm being cautiously optimistic. Thank you for your input.

  I'm staying at my mom's when the story begins. It's where I always went after a long binge of goin around town gettin high for a week or so. She didnt like it, but I was just out of highschool and didnt have a place of my own so, as long as i didnt bring anything there, she saw it as a place where I was safe. It'd already been a few days since my last hit so I'm starting to crave that rush again, when i get a call from this other tweaker who said he knew someone willing to trade weed for dope, and, of course, I had weed. Now mind you this guy was OUT THERE. I usually didnt like to associate with him, but, alas, I needed some shit.

    Moving on to the second part of the story. He picks me up and we drive to the hood to do the deal. Everything went smooth and we rode back to where he stayed which was off in the woods. Granted the entire county we were in was off in the woods but this place was really secluded. We shoot up what we had and chill. Nothing out of the ordinary until after a few minutes his mood goes from happy to hypervigilant. Hes checking the windows and keeps eyeballing me really hard. I get bad vibes so as naturally as I can, i ask, ""hey man, wanna take me back home now?"" 

  He didnt like this apparently because he started flipping out. Asking me questions like what my real name was or who I worked for. I calmly tell him he knows my real name and that I dont even have a job as hes seen me around the neighborhood getting high almost everyday. Hes still convinced something fishy is going on so he wakes up his friend in the other room. His friend comes out with a gun pointed to me and tells me to stay still so I do.

  After some arguing he grabs some rope and ties my hands up and almost drags me out back to his shed and pushes me to the wall. He then comes up to me and pushes a knife to my throat. I know the worst thing to do in this situation is to freak out so I keep a straight face and speak slowly. 

""I'm not a cop. I've never talked to the cops about any of this. Tell me one single bit of information that made you think I was the police.""

 At this point he starts to calm down.  He gets the idea to call up this guy me and him have used as a dealer for years and asks him. Thankfully this guy knows I've never snitched on anyone and vouches for me. And then just like that his mood switches back to normal and he unties me and I call up a friend of mine to pick me up.

  Sorry the anticlimactic ending but god I was just happy to get out of there. Sadly though it wouldn't be the last time I did meth."

I'm 99% certain that, now, the court system isn't what's keeping me clean, it's my desire to not go down that road, but I'm just worried about that small chance that I've tricked myself into believing that so that I wont go to prison."

Drugs,fo6ruif,t3_g60d4c,1587565513.0,"God I still get so close to having panic attacks when I think about how close I came to death so many times on meth. Getting shot at, being tied up in a shed with a knife to my throat because this tweaker thought I was a cop, or just randomly passing out in the hood after being up for a week, it was fucking crazy. It's hard to OD on meth, unlike opiates. And also unlike opiates, alcohol, and benzos, there are few if any physical withdrawals from meth. But jesus christ the psychosis alone is enough to make up for that."
