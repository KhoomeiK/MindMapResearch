NewOrleans,f1mjic1,t3_cijr6t,1569595370.0,"  In case anyone is still following this topic, below is a pretty interesting, recent news report on the Opioid crisis in Louisiana. Even though the national rate of overdoses is falling, Louisiana's rates are increasing. Orleans and Jefferson parishes are particularly impacted. [https://www.fox8live.com/2019/08/07/cdc-opioid-overdoses-stabilize-nationwide-continue-rise-la/](https://www.fox8live.com/2019/08/07/cdc-opioid-overdoses-stabilize-nationwide-continue-rise-la/) 

If anyone here is struggling with opioid addiction or knows someone who is, there are affordable/free recovery resources available. Specifically, there is an outpatient detox program at the federally qualified health center in Jefferson Parish. Their fees are based on income and it may even be free for some folks who qualify. Plus, you don't have to be a resident of Jefferson Parish to get services there."

Anxiety,f1mi2kt,t3_d9qsam,1569594409.0,"Proud of you! I get that way when it's time to go grocery shopping. My SO knows the drill, so we prepare ahead of time and work together to make the process as quick and painless as possible. Support from your loved ones and confidence in yourself makes such a big difference!"

lexapro,eyzdlmj,t3_czleem,1567615327.0,"I was on Lexapro \~10 years and I used to have very vivid dreams and often experienced sleep talking/sleep paralysis. I was always a pretty vivid dreamer though, so I think the meds just increased that brain activity for me. I've been tapering down over the past couple of years and have now been totally off for a few months. I still have vivid dreams and sleep talking, but not nearly as much as I used to. And I barely ever have sleep paralysis now, which was probably the worst part of it all."
