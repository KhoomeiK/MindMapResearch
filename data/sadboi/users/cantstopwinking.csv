As the story is originally written in Russian, sometime it is translated weirdly but overall still enjoyable. It has weird animation, with the character having facial expression that tbh is just screaming face. The background is rather pretty and more in line with the situation for example a character get punch in the eye, you‚Äôll see them having black eye. 

If anyone feel disappointed bout Distant Shores, Romance Club has a pirate book. It also has a good horror book for those who like It Lives series. My fave would be Heaven Secrets where you play as demon/angel and lust over Lucifer lol

I don‚Äôt like Chapters because it‚Äôs more of a visual novel, everything is already set. Afterall most are from published books, right? I think I installed and installed it several times. I prefer Tabou for raunchier stories, or Secrets

But I mostly fantasize about acting, I like musicals and have a penchant for dramatic. I‚Äôve actually join my college drama club but never went to any of the meetings.

My ex was also in the drama club and that was one of the reason I why I had avoid it but now I can‚Äôt help thinking if what if I just went to the auditions. Even if I didn‚Äôt get the lead role, I would still be part of it. It hurt so much that I keep on recreating the scene in my mind. 

Meanwhile with dancing, most of my friends are very talented in dancing that my classmate would think I was good too.

LI 1 egoistical, leader, bad boy with a good heart 
L2 the good guy, friends to lover 
L3 could be from another pack, a long lost friend

2. Espionage
A sexy confident spy do I need to elaborate more. Each season could be different cases/identity
Female James Bond 

3. Ballet
The competitive world of ballet, could take place in the academy or at the ballet company. Whenever I think of Russia, I think of modelling, ballet and rhythmic gymnastic. Well a book with any of said topic would be entertaining I feel. 

4. Medieval
I miss GOT and need a visual novel with similar vibes. MC is a princess whose kingdom have been conquered. She tries to claimed back her rights, and we gonna choose how she would do so- by strength (army), diplomacy(making allies), or wiles. MC would also have magical powers.

5. Story about witches/magic

Choices,fnokhs4,t3_fuuy8u,1587127569.0,"I don‚Äôt have the energy to play Choices this day and played Romance Club instead. Perhaps it‚Äôs the lack of diamonds but Choices just feel not as enjoyable as it is. There seems to be more and more diamond choices, which doesn‚Äôt really affect the plot but instead make the chapter shorter if you didn‚Äôt get it. Romance Club feels more natural and diamond choices are cheaper and does affect the plot, like having sex make you and the LI closer."

BPD,fn2cdrg,t3_fygzlo,1586584229.0,I feel you. I went to a hospital specialised for mental health in my country after my university doctor saw the cuts on my wrist. I was seeing both counsellor and therapist but I still didn‚Äôt get any diagnosed(if I really recall). They just said I have a mood swing that may be a bipolar. I had many doctors and have several breaks so that didn‚Äôt help either. Did says I feel like I have bpd to the last doctor I was seeing but forgot what she react. But yeah I feel like I wasn‚Äôt taken seriously because I was still going out with my friend tho I was very unstable and hyper sexual

I‚Äôm like WTF? my doc did suggest me to be hospitalised but the clinic i went to isn‚Äôt from my hometown so if I stayed it means I‚Äôm gonna miss my flight and get hate from my family"
