PCOS,f3lirq6,t3_dh55en,1570976385.0,"Hey there, firstly it's just PCOS Don't stressed too much. This syndrome is basically based on your lifestyle. If you're overweight you need to cut down your weight and if you're underweight then you need to put on some healthy weight.

1. Sleep for at least 8 hours not more than that.
 
2. Go vegan( no meat,egg,dairy,gluten,soy)

3. Drink detox water throughout the day.

4. Drink pure herbal teas like chamomile tea,                               Lavender tea(best for good sleep or relaxation), sage tea, green tea, spearmint tea (best for hirsutism), rosehip tea, hibiscus tea (best for hormonal acne prone skin).

5. Go natural with your skin care products. Skin care products should be free from sulphate and paraben-free, vegan, 100% pure or natural.

6. Do some exercise which you love doing it like dancing/zumba ( at least for 1 hr), cycling, go for a walk, swimming, yoga,etc

7. Eat your meals in regular intervals like breakfast, lunch, tea time, dinner,etc.

8. Eat more seeds, vegetables and fruits. It will give you required protein, vitamins n minerals.

9. NEVER TAKE HORMONAL PILLS OR AS IT IS CALLED 21DAYS PILLS. At first the pills will do miracles for you but after sometimes later you will become moody due to certain hormonal changes happening not naturally in your body. I have gone through the nightmares of my life due to that pills.

10. Use essential oils. Put few drops in your bathtub or your regular oil n get a massage.

You're thinking right now that so much to do but it is not that difficult. Just you have to believe in what you're putting your energy in. Do have cheat day once in a month. If you're going vegan then use vegan products which are available in the market.

1. Do yoga or go for a walk at 6 or 6:30 am( that time is good and has fresh air)

2. Go vegan but you can have junk foods in healthier ways. And most importantly have cheat day once in a month.

3. If you tend to stress out more than normal, just involve yourself in relaxing activities like... Go to dance classes, learn singing, do painting or mandala art, go for swimming, do journaling or go for cycling.

4. Drink detox water throughout the day.

5. Drink herb teas like for hirsutism drink spearmint tea, for sleep drink lavender n chamomile tea, green tea should be consumed at early morning, rosehip and hibiscus teas are good for hormonal acne prone skin. 

You can have a relaxing bath by putting essential oils in the water or have massage by putting essential oils in your regular oil.

I read ur previous comments that you can't stop chicken, but girl u hv to. Because meat increases androgen in ur body which then convert into testosterone (free radicals). It's not too late because PCOS its just lifestyle problem which can be solved through strict diet, workout n discipline.
1. Go vegan (no to meat/egg/fish, etc)
 2. You can eat substitutes in vegan like coconut 
        Milk, almond milk, almond flour, oatmeal, (don't consume soy products as it contains estrogenic substances)
3. Avoid using makeup n skincare products which are not sulphate n paraben-free.
4. Do some exercise like go for a walk, cycling, swimming (best for weight loss), zumba, yoga,etc
5. Last but not least, drink herbal teas like savage tea, lavender and chamomile tea, spearmint and green tea, rosehip and hibiscus tea,etc

From ur previous comments I know that ur a junk eater and can't control yourself for too long n so do I. If you wanna eat cheese sandwich you can, in market there are products like vegan cheese n gluten free breads available. And have cheat days about once in a month. On that day eat whatever you want grl so you won't feel pressured of doing this diet.

mentalhealth,f26crt0,t3_dc219g,1570003459.0,"Hey there, I have experienced major mood swings n tried to do self harm too so here is my suggestion to pull yourself up from this situation.
It can be caused due to merger of depression and anxiety symptoms. Go check yourself to a psychologist or therapist at first. If they recommend you to have medicines then only consult to psychiatrist because doctor in this field will not guide you personally on your behaviour but only provide medicines but some psychiatrist do have caring n supportive nature. Quit smoking, I know that it is distressing n mind relaxing  but it is making you weaker by stopping your emotions to flow. Get yourself engaged in yoga or meditation to calm down your thoughts n just relax. Don't worry your not the only one going through this kind of stuff n it is normal due to stressful lifestyle but choose your mental health care doctor correctly."

Just ignore them like we ignore barking dogs on strict. The dogs stop barking when they get to know that this person will not give a penny of attention.

mentalhealth,f23bmam,t3_dbias0,1569915227.0,Yes It happened to most of people. Depression is a state of mind where people locked their feelings n emotions knowingly or unknowingly that's why after few days we stop recognising our feelings. We named our depression as our laziness or frustration. Suppressing feelings and emotions leads to panic attacks too so never do that to yourself instead go to a place where you can shred few tears alone.
PCOS,f23b8bf,t1_f228v9c,1569914623.0,"Hi grl, I know how much it is difficult to go n do exercise daily but you can hv a close friend who can give u a reminder daily to go do ur exercise routine or else I can help u with that follow me @health_fitness_motivation_food on insta I will follow back you n DM me reddit so I can know. You can even appoint a personal trainer for yourself who will motivate you. Secondly, if you're feeling out of stamina n low go to a nutritionist who can provide you with vitamins n supplements which your body is lacking from your diet or meal. You have the best condition, mine was little too difficult with hair loss,acne,unwanted hair,stress, depression, anxiety,panic attack n major mood swings problem.

PCOS,f22cnoo,t1_f21ui4h,1569886430.0,"Hi grl don't worry. Many doctors recommend hormone pills which in real are dangerous to your health. Your ovary is not getting a hormone to continue the next process that's y doctor gave hormone in form of pills so that your ovary can start functioning but It has side effects. Your ovary fully will depend on that pills n there will be mood swings due to certain changes in hormone levels due to pills. When you stop taking pills your periods will be irregular, you will have acne n hair loss too. My advise will be to go vegan, do exercise which you love doing it, cut down your stress and avoid using makeup n toxic skin care products n go natural. It will take time for your body to release hormone to start the ovary function naturally but it will not have any side effects."
PCOS,f22a1en,t3_dbdp1w,1569885080.0,"Hey here, I have a suggestion for you but you have to be patient n consistent. Drink spearmint tea twice a day not more than that because it can mess with your hormones. Try this for 6months consistently. And with that Do vegan diet n do exercise, yoga or go for daily morning walk. This will help to cut down androgen level n lower your testosterone level. Avoid using makeup n toxic skin care products. Your products should be paraben free, sulphate free, SLS free, artificial colours and scent free n product should be vegan too. Girl I know how difficult is to go through this because I have gone through it. Do as I mentioned for 6months you will find some changes in your weight n in growth of unwanted hair.

PCOS,f227ba5,t3_dbeoy5,1569883380.0,"Hey here, first of all I am no doctor to give any professional advice but to my personal experience I would like to suggest you something. First, cut out stress. Due to overstressed, adrenal glad slow the production of DHEA n may increase or decrease the level of cortisol which a hormone to cop up the stress. SO you can go for a walk in park, do yoga, painting, journaling, swimming,etc. Second, go vegan. Yes you have to stop eating protein as in form of meat. Eating meat leads to increase free radicals that is androgen which later on convert into testosterone (male hormone). Due to increase in male hormone levels in body, female with PCOS gets facial hair,acne and hair loss. For facial hair you can drink spearmint tea two cups each day. For hair loss n acne, stop using toxic products n go natural. Don't use shampoo instead use ayurvedic herbs to clean your scalp. Third, eat more and healthy. Yes, divide your day in regular eating intervals. Eating in intervals helps to maintain insulin level n stop your carvings for junk. Fourth, weight loss with PCOS doesn't go without exercise. I am not saying to go n break yourself in gym, every body is different from each other. So you will have to decide that which exercise you can do happy with no stress. For example you can go cycling, do Zumba or else do Aerobics. Fifth, when you will start your transformation, please record your journey so that there will be times when you wanna give up on yourself, watch your journey till you are it will be a reminder for you to not give up because you have came so far n closer to your goal. I have gone through this that's y surely can say this above 5points confidently."

Second, your giving much more importance to the people who doesn't deserve it to be given. By thinking about them, your wasting  time n energy on those people.

I learn to cope up with my social anxiety. First, install socializing apps or games where you can talk to strangers.

Your partner would never want you to quit life by harming yourself. He loves you n so would like to see you happy in your life. But never forget him ,remember good times with him n enjoy your life. He is watching you from above n if he saw you hurt or try killing yourself he will be hurt too. Don't hurt his spirit by hurting yourself, let him be in peace as you enjoy.

First, go to cops n file a report on him, i know that your mother n sis told you not to do that but they are not the one who is suffering the abuse. You have to make the decision on this. Want to live in hell or want you're freedom. If you filed against him he will be careful  about things. Second, after filing reports he may abuse you more but have your friends around you or complaint to the campus authority about him.
Third, have self confidence that you're brave n stronger than that bully bad cousin. Don't let anyone have hold of you, its you body n you should be the one to rule it not anyone.

First, ignore or cut out toxic people from your life. Now in your case your mom is the one and you can't ignore or cut out her from your life. Start writing journal it is important because you can express your feelings n feel the emotions that you have been hiding, or else talk it out with a close friend or have a friend online who can connect with you daily. Second do yoga, swimming or take a morning walk. I know it is easy to say but difficult for you to do. But talk to a friend n tell them to push u if possible. Third, eat healthy and in regular intervals. At first you will not be liking healthy eating but as the time goes by you will start to feel good within yourself.
I have some reasons to my solutions which you need to understand so you can overcome this situation. You're already struggling with a mental illness so it is easy to have another mental illness due to stress. I think you may have depression or maybe something else. This mental illnesses are caused by stress, hormonal imbalance or it can be genetic. You're feeling low energy is due to high level of cortisol which is an hormone released when there is stress. Eat healthy and exercise so cortisol n adrenal  glad can work at its best condition and don't worry if you don't have someone to talk to on daily basis, you can talk to me here or else on Instagram @health_fitness_motivation_food, just DM me."

Make her feel every memories of you and her. She should feel your love,your daughter's n families love can heal her heart. Make her realized that she is being wanted, needed and loved by you, her daughter, parents and friends. If you do believe in God, hold her hands n read the pray and worship songs around her so she couldn't be low on her faith. God is the ultimate creator if you both believe in him, he will not take away a mother from her daughter. If by god grace she release from that hospital, take her to a vacation with friends and family. She will feel blessed to have such a huge support for her. Stay calm and pray."
mentalhealth,f0zj7mt,t3_d7f2a7,1569096700.0,"Hi, my suggestion will be first you should take care of yourself and then you will be able to help her. If you will be stressing out about her then who will be her support system that's why you should be stress free to motivate her. Second thing, she should go to psychiatrist and if she is then its her family who should be making a caring n lovable environment for her. Third thing, motivate her towards doing some kind of exercise which may release her stress. She can go for a walk, Gyming, cycling, swimming or else Zumba and yoga are the best. Your having panic attacks right? Do meditation breathe in from your both nostril and  out the air for 5 secs and then release it though your mouth while close your nose.
Daily do this exercise for 15 to 20 mins as days go by increase your breathe hold up time and you will see huge difference whether it may be depression, anxiety or panic attack."
