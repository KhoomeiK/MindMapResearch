I still buy and cook them meat several times a week. Remind her that others peoples choices are there own choices and that she can always remedy her worries about meat fingers by cleaning the fridge extra inside and out (hello guilting her into cleaning!) also remind her that if you ever go out to eat her vegan food has been prepared in the same kitchen that prepares non vegan food and her vegan food is bought in stores that sell non vegan food. The only way for her to ensure that her food has NEVER EVER come in contact worth non vegan food is to literally grow all of her own food and store it in her own separate fridge and cook with her own separate ones that she cleans with her own separate sponge. Also I’m sure y’all share plates and forks and knives. 

Last note, if she is a SERIOUS vegan, tel her to google EVERYTHING and never trust a product unless it says certified vegan. Anything not certified vegan has probably come in contact with something that has come in contact with non vegan items. Her request is ridiculous, and she is acting like the stereotypical vegan that people hate. No one likes that. Not even fellow vegans."
