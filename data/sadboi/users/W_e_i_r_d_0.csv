Coronavirus,fr0jbzz,t1_fr0gkd1,1589797718.0,"I really feel for you. I'm in a similar boat, my country's government used the emergency to further establish its position, and it made me feel extremely scared and vulnerable too. I'm surprised that we're still miraculously getting by.  Plus my family is extremely lucky, my mother has a stable workplace that takes safety extremely seriously. I wish it was the case everywhere. Some people think the whole pandemy is a conspiracy... idiots. 

Yeah, this thing really impacts us like a house of cards, isn't it? :/ We all rely on one another, and with so many people affected, we all crumble together. I'm worried about the years to come. The only silver lining I can see is that a lot of people seem to care for each other even while going through hardship. Plus I feel optimistic that a cure or vaccine will be found soon (though I realize it will take us a while to distribute it everywhere). 

I truly wish the best for you and your family. I hope the sickness won't lay even one of its evil spike tentacles on you. I agree, it's better to take a hit financially than to die, as long as you still have that choice. I don't think it's selfish at all, it wouldn't be selfish not to go into a burning house without proper protective equipment to die with the rest. It is said that you have to take care of yourself first in case of an emergency, so that you have a chance to survive and help others later, to rebuild the world. Now we're all on that falling plane, you've got to put on the oxygen mask on yourself first."
