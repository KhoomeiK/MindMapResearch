intermittentfasting,fr0cqtt,t3_glx72h,1589791016.0,"Hey, I've been intermittent fasting since Jan and had a 1 month break while I weaned off my meds. I'm diagnosed bipolar 1/schizoaffective (previously schizophrenia). Tips would be to drink teas and lots if water to try and get the thought of food out of your head. I have repetitive, obsessive thoughts so I have to constantly consume something (teas, water, sugar free energy drinks) to get food out of my head.

Also I have to say - if your psychosis seems to be returning you should call your psychiatrist asap and stop intermittent fasting. Apparently stress can make psychosis way worse.

Good luck!!!"

waiting_to_try,fq8ei8u,t3_ghdyan,1589164390.0,"Have you spoken to your doctor about why this may be happening? 
I would suggest getting a blood test to check prolactin levels in your blood. Certain SSRIs can cause elevated prolactin levels that can stop your periods. I only know this because I was on antipsychotics that stopped my period for many months. I had to stop taking the medication because I want to start TTC, and my period came back after a month of stopping the medication.

Hope that helps!"
schizoaffective,fpuzdzf,t1_fpuuxty,1588929222.0,"You should definitely stop your therapist when she brushes you off and assert to her that this is very important to you and the symptoms are getting worse. It's really unfortunate that she isn't listening to you, could you change therapists?? When I was 17 and told my school counsellor i was afraid of ghosts and demons in my bedroom he ignored me as well.

The symptoms of schizophrenia also has symptoms from clusters of other disorders as well, so please dont drive yourself mad thinking that you have it when you might not even have it. But believe me, even if you do have schizophrenia or a psychotic disorder, your life would not be ruined. You have good insight of yourself and your problems, and you are actively seeking to find professional help - a lot of psychotic people lack insight of their illness. It does sound like you have a lot of anxiety however (research anxiety - a lot of people with anxiety seem to be terrified about having schizophrenia)."
schizoaffective,fpuuhjs,t3_gfogz7,1588924139.0,"Hey! I tried skimming through your previous posts to get a better idea about your situation. It definitely sounds like a very stressful time for you. I used to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, but now it's schizoaffective/bipolar 1 (psychiatrist cant decide which one yet lol).

Before I started medication, i was seeing flies constantly following me around and spiders as well. I had anhedonia, was very flat, and my thoughts were very erratic (repeating words, conversations, songs with changed words). I would also second guess my experiences - what if this is just the normal human experience but my anxiety makes me think it's not? What if I'm making it up coz I want attention? 

Turns out I was just having my 2nd psychotic episode. Back before I got my official diagnosis I used to do the same thing you're doing - post about my symptoms and try to get as much advice as possible. I was super worried about having schizophrenia as well. You may or may not have it (it could even be anxiety or another disorder), but if you ever find that you do have SZ or SZA, it really isn't the end of the world. Ease your worries and try to find a way to get a proper diagnosis so you can begin proper treatment (I understand that's difficult right now). Do you go to school/have a school counsellor?

Btw feel free to message me if you need to talk more about your symptoms/experiences."

Warmelon is the name of my art business, I just love the name so I use it for everything haha.
I'm from Australia! 
I'm currently a student, in my final year of graduating with a masters degree in Social Work. I'm also an artist.
I met my husband 9 years ago in my first university degree, we were studying Animation together. Been married over a year. 
We talked about having kids for a really long time but never really considered it seriously until late last year. We haven't started trying yet, but I just started prenatals today and will be starting to try in about a month!

Medical concerns... I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1/schizoaffective (and previously with schizophrenia). My medication gave me hyperprolacticemia so I'm currently not able to try for a baby until my prolactin level returns to normal and my period returns.

I end up sleeping with all the lights on, and before I got married I would sleep with a night light. I'm really not sure if delusions are tied to episodes or not, but from experience I don't have to be in an episode to get delusional (although if I'm depressed it affects me 10 times worse).

Try to find ways to bring your mind back into reality, it's the only way I found that controls it to some extent. Watching cars go by at night and watching youtubers talk about mundane things helped me. It helped me realise that all this is only in my head. And of course, see your pdoc :)"
BipolarReddit,ffbpn47,t3_esrh0o,1579777433.0,"Hey, I have a VERY similar issue you described. It was the main reason why I went to a pdoc. Initially I was diagnosed with schizophrenia but it got changed to bipolar type 1 due to that delusion. When I'm alone at night I feel a presence and I'm terrified. Something that works for me is to look out the window and watch cars passing by and think ""they don't experience this because it's only in my head"". I still cant sleep in the dark alone and I've spent 9 months a few years ago only sleeping at sunrise (I had a delusion that ""they"" can only hurt me at night).

Also, I was aware of my delusion and how silly it was but I still couldn't shake the feeling of terror at night and the ""presence"" feeling.

I'm not as bad anymore, mostly from taking my meds (Latuda) which is an antipsychotic. Definitely tell your pdoc about this, it's just horrific to experience. If you need any advice or have questions feel free to message me."

Uni is fucking hard already, having bipolar makes it harder sometimes.

As for the friends thing, I have a few friends at uni with bipolar as well. Everyone I've told has been super supportive; telling them has made the uni experience much better for me. If you're ready to tell them, tell them. It might make it easier for you too."

In all honesty it doesnt sound like my thing lmao but only because my moods don't accompany my psychosis. If I'm psychotic its very random and stress induced, and I often just see imaginary flies following me around (and if I'm delusional, the beliefs are more terrifying and only active at nights). My mood and psychosis isn't really connected, hence why I was confused about the diagnosis. I think schizoaffective fits me more but to be honest, the other person who commented on the post is right.

Schizophrenia is so complex and so different from person to person. I am more mild-moderate on the spectrum, and I have a wonderful relationship with my husband. It's hard for him because I'm absolutely FLOORED by negative symptoms and visual hallucinations but he's very supportive and patient with me. What makes living with me so difficult is the negative symptoms and memory/cognitive issues.

Have a read on this forum about all of our experiences to get a glimpse into the illness. It always varies in intensity and experience, everyone is vastly different and unique!

I would say give him a chance to explain his experience to you. Be patient and he should hopefully tell you about those episodes In more detail, and what you can do to best support him and your new relationship with him. 
My husband has never had mental health issues, not even depression, and he manages me so well and always says he wouldn't change anything about me, not even my illness. But I do admit it can be extremely hard to deal with, especially if im beginning to get delusional and bed-ridden.

That's what I think :)"

schizophrenia,evrc7rk,t3_ckw231,1564705294.0,"Hi!

I would highly suggest visiting the hospital if you were about to go out and harm people and harm yourself. You should seek help immediately because it's so unpleasant to live with and it sounds like you're super stressed out with those voices :( 
Nothing wrong with getting help, we all get help when we need it."
Psychosis,evp9rkm,t3_ckomie,1564669174.0,"Thanks for sharing your story, I actually was so happy to read that you are still with your girlfriend!

My story is quite short actually. When I was 16 i began to get paranoid about demons in my bedroom. Then it became a fullblown delusion at age 20 and then a whole bunch of other delusions. I believed that demons were watching me and were waiting to pull me into their dimension. They would only come out when the sun went down and would only return back to their dimension when the sun rose. So I spent 9 months only being able to sleep at sunrise. I couldn't shower alone because I thought there was a girl (like the one in the ring -  I've never seen the movie) who lived in my shower. To avoid demons getting me I had to face the door and shower with my eyes open. Also thought blood and acid was going to come out of my shower head, that used to terrify me. Then I started thinking that if I slept in a position that dead people would be in, then the death angel would mistake me for dead and steal my soul. Basically I didn't sleep properly for 9 months and my mum thought I was possessed and on drugs lol. I was paranoid that people were talking about me, and that everyone was conspiring against me. It was a horrible time. I also thought aliens were going to kill me because I ""figured out that they exist"". After 9 months of psychosis it went away. 

6 years later today, I started visually hallucinating, horrendous negative symptoms, and some paranoia has come back (but my psychiatrist has quickly put me back on meds).
That's my little story hehe."
schizophrenia,evoo5bi,t3_ckk4z4,1564652158.0,"I'll comment just because I see similar things.
I see flies and bugs and anything gross. But I also have crippling negative symptoms. In high school (2 years prior my first big episode), I was very paranoid about supernatural things. My grades were dropping, I started to sleep 12 hours a day. My paranoia gradually turned to full blown delusions and I was seeing shadows at the corner of my eyes. After 9 months of psychosis, I came out of it. 6 years after my first episode, I began to have very clear hallucinations of flies and bugs (past 2 months). I'm on meds now, but I still get an occasional visual here and there every day.

I suggest research ""prodromal schizophrenia"" or ""schizophrenia prodrome"" because that's what you're looking for I think :)

If you're asking for ""does this sound like sz?"" My answer is... I don't know. There's a lot more to this illness than hallucinations."
bipolar,evninwg,t1_evks7f3,1564625721.0,"Yeah totally! I read online that it could be a side effect and I definitely got stuffy after taking it.
I started on 100mg and I'm still on 100mg. My psychiatrist doesn't want to increase it just yet.
Definitely observe yourself and see how you go.
I wish you the best!"
bipolar,evkos0d,t3_ck8z8a,1564584465.0,"Hey hey! I don't have bipolar (Being treated for Schizophrenia but I lurk this subreddit).

It's currently my fourth week on Quetiapine, the first week was very difficult (incredible lethargy, dizziness,  drowsiness, stuffy nose which I still currently have from it, and even trouble swallowing). But from my experience it got better. I can wake up earlier, and the drowsiness is lessening as each day goes by. I'm quite irritable in general even pre-meds but I do admit I do get instances where it spikes. I suspect it may be the Quetiapine. It also depends on the dosages apparently - lower doses have a stronger sedating effect than higher doses for some reason.

I say stick with it for 3-4 weeks. If it's still shit, then switch to something else. Its different for everyone!"
schizophrenia,evk8zwx,t3_ck7f63,1564577652.0,"Do you ever copy other people's mannerisms and behaviours during conversations? 
Because I do and I was wondering if others with sz do as well?

I do it because I feel like I don't know how to be like a  ""normal"" person but sometimes the other person notices and it becomes awkward. I feel different to others."

schizophrenia,evb6y05,t3_cj4kkv,1564367656.0,"Hey there!

We can't diagnose you or say it is or it isn't. But what I can tell you: go see a psychiatrist as soon as you can.

Why?  Because not sleeping, being increasingly paranoid, and ""seeing things at the corner of your eye"" are horrible things to experience and you should address these to a doctor so you can find ways to cope and feel better.

When I was younger, I had very similar issues. I never got help for it, so i suffered for a very long time."
