vipassana,fqeuu6c,t1_fqereg1,1589313965.0,"I think you could make an argument that going to regular services is what makes someone ""a Christian"", even though Christians would generally disagree with that.

I still think that idea deserves to be differentiated from ""Christianity"" as an entity. Church services might be the way most people interact with Christianity, but the religion itself is like its own organism with so many different branches and so many ways it interacts with world history, politics, Western culture, moral and economic perspectives, etc... it's much more than ""people sitting in church"" or any single activity that people do.

That's my only point -- Buddhism is the same. Yeah, meditation is one aspect of being Buddhist, but as an entity it's much more than that. So dhamma.org could very easily say that Vipassana ""is not a religion"", even though it clearly comes from Buddhism which is a religion."

So, convince everyone to go vegan, convince the wealthy to give up their consumption, distribute resources as though we actually value all human lives, develop efficient infrastructure; in that world, I'll agree that we should consider increasing the population. 

But I think the world is nowhere near even forming a consensus that we should share these goals, and until we make significant progress on them, we shouldn't be bringing billions of more people into this miserable system unless we can demonstrate that humans are actually capable of getting their shit together."
LateStageCapitalism,fix6d42,t1_fiw54pl,1582813734.0,"I'd argue that we are close to the limit already. A quick google search tells me we already use 50% of all habitable land for agriculture. That's a problem. Yes we *could* reduce more biodiverse regions to monocultures, but I don't think it's a sustainable goal to absolutely maximize our food yield. We need to allow space for other ecosystems to exist other than ones that support humans.

I also share the goal of preserving the legacy of earth beyond the death of the sun, but I think the extinction threat caused by consumption is far greater than the threat of the sun's eventual expansion. We've shown that technology can advance very quickly with 5 billion people, certainly fast enough that if it keeps going at that rate, we'll be out of the solar system before the sun scorches earth. Having 30 billion is absolutely not necessary for that goal. Honestly I think there is likely to be more scientific progress if 5 billion people are living comfortably rather than 30 billion who mostly have to live in poverty.

If we figured out very efficient ways to live, and were stable in those practices for a while, and stabilized human-induced climate change, and found that we still had room to expand -- then, sure, ramp it up a little bit. 

We clearly agree that it's absolutely vital to create more efficient ways of living and to limit the people who consume the most, but I disagree with there being any rush to create more people in the name of scientific progress. I think that can only be counterproductive for the time being."
LateStageCapitalism,fivajpy,t1_figj00u,1582756917.0,"I agree with a lot of that... The question is, how do you motivate people / governments / corporations to actually care about efficiency? I care about it a lot in my own life, and one of my main goals in life is to help make efficiency more of a concern to other people... but it's not very popular currently since efficiency means less profits, and there will always be the powerful people who don't care at all. How do you reign them in, practically? 

I still think keeping population and consumption in check at the same time is the best idea. I still think that no matter how efficient we are, humans have a minimum caloric need which translates to agricultural acreage. There's not really a need for 30 billion humans. 

And the same question has to be asked -- how do you motivate people to have fewer children? This has been done by China for example; not sure if it was a good solution. Maybe you don't tax childless people, and raise taxes for each child they have. IDK.

I'm also skeptical that automation could really get to the point that one person could extract such a vast amount of resources. I mean, with an AI singularity anything is possible, but at that point all bets are off anyway. To a large extent, yes, individuals are becoming more capable of consuming more and more, but I'm not sure it scales quite to the point of 1 person being unsustainable for the entire planet."
LateStageCapitalism,fifywm0,t1_ffyq950,1582394490.0,"One thing that *will* always scale with population is agriculture. Everyone has caloric requirements, which take up a certain amount of farm space.

How much land have we already dedicated to farming? Destroying habitats to feed ourselves.

Sure, we can work to make it more efficient, with various impacts on the nutrition of the food and the impact on surrounding ecosystems.

At some point we'll have 30 billion people highly dependent on the efficiency of the world's farms. How many billions will suddenly starve when some disaster strikes and food output is halved for a year? If we instead had a population of 1-5 billion, there would be a lot less pressure on agriculture and all the other industries that meet humans' basic needs.

Fusion would/will be cool, but I'm skeptical it will solve all energy problems -- check out [Jevon's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) if you haven't. When more energy becomes more cheaply available, people don't really say ""great, now I can keep my consumption the same and spend less money."" Their budget stays the same, so they consume more energy, and even if it comes from fusion, converting mass to energy will heat up the planet... though I agree we should develop it because it seems like it can't be worse than what we're doing currently.

In any case, I think humanity's top priority for survival should be establishing equilibrium with the environment. Climate change and ecosystem collapse are more likely to kill us in the next 100 years than our inability to set up a colony on Mars, for example."
changemyview,fiasfki,t1_fiar8vh,1582307486.0,"To be fair, the wording in the initial sentence said ""Republicans tend to use more hierarchical reasoning, while Democrats tend to use more horizontal reasoning"" rather than claiming they use these types of reasoning exclusively.

But you're right that the rest of the comment kind of implies that socialism will have no hierarchy. I objected to this in another reply but ultimately decided the point had some amount of truth to it."
changemyview,fiaq8il,t1_fiaot3q,1582306279.0,"Again, this discussion has never been about whether one side is right or not. It's about whether both sides engage in similar psychological fallacies in order to *feel* that their group is right. Do you understand the distinction or not?

It's less about whether or not people should believe that other people are wrong, or who is actually right or wrong... you're very fixated on that for some reason. My interest is in how/why they came to that conclusion. Was it their own process of critical thinking, or did they simply conform to their environment?

I never said all bad things are done out of ignorance. I said these systems CAN suck you in, not that they always do. I think it's better to give people the benefit of the doubt when you don't know them, rather than assuming they're malicious, even though it could be either one."
changemyview,fiao1zv,t1_fia45uu,1582305009.0,"You're essentially just trying to convince me that the left is correct, and I said I wasn't interested in that debate. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would like to debate you but that wasn't the point here.

I already identify more with leftist views. I think about the fact that the median individual global income is $3,000/year adjusted for US cost of living, and I think about how many people are suffering in poverty and that their lives are just as valuable as ours, and I think we should redistribute our wealth to a significant degree to raise the quality of life for everyone. I think we should open all borders for free travel for everyone. I don't think anyone needs more than 100 million dollars and we should cap individual wealth somewhere around there, because other people are dying without that money.

I don't see either of the mainstream parties rushing to degrow the economy or shrink the status of the US compared to the rest of the world, which is what I'd ultimately like to see. I think they're both focused a lot on the same goals of increasing our wealth at the expense of the rest of the planet, regardless of whether they play lip service to caring about equality or climate change. They're nowhere near radical enough to make a difference. Which is why I think the 2 mainstream parties are kind of 2 sides of the same coin and serve as more of a diversion of attention than anything else, a constant distraction from the real harm that's being done.

So that's what I think is the truth. Obviously I don't actually think that if people believe two different things, neither of them can be right. Clearly all mainstream media is capitalist and if someone said they were communist they'd be wrong. If people come to conclusions based on their own careful observations, research, and independent thoughtful open-minded analysis, that's one thing. But people on both sides of the current political machine get sucked in by some of the same fallacious aspects of groupthink and then end up locked in a constant, unproductive battle against each other using many of the same mechanisms, which is what I'm trying to counter here.

So my position is not a centrist position that any ""extreme"" belief is wrong. My point is that many people on the mainstream left and right are susceptible to the fallacy of tribalistic thinking and that this has a detrimental effect on society. Can you see the distinction, even if you disagree with my claim?

I don't think there's anything wrong with holding our own views and even working to convince others that they are true. But I think we can be more effective by understanding psychology and having empathy for why others believe what they do. For example, I grew up very Christian but I left that and now I actively work to support people who are leaving religion, and I write articles pointing out the fallacies of religious belief. But I always keep in mind that when that environment is all you've ever known, it's very hard to even think about starting to view the world through a different lens. It's a powerful system that can suck you in and cause you to do & believe unfortunate things even if you are intelligent and well-meaning. In other words, we need to fight problematic systems, not the victims who get sucked in to them."
