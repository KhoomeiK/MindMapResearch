There's nothing wrong with not wanting to date trans people, but if a gay man dates a trans man, that doesn't suddenly make him bi. Trans men identify as men, and if you respect that identification, then deciding to date one is like deciding to date anyone else - if they have features you don't like, don't date them, but don't diss them or people who are attracted to them. I mean, what even is ""straight sex""? You do realize that a lot of trans men don't even like to have vaginal sex, right? And that some don't even even have those parts anymore?

Point is, I think it's silly to downvote people for sharing their preferences, but if the way you do so is by going on this weird spiel about 'trans ideology' and 'straight sex' then maybe the downvotes make sense."

FTMMen,fqwj5gj,t1_fqvdayj,1589706345.0,"I had a very similar experience growing up in a reformed Baptist family  - my dad was a minister for part of my childhood and as his eldest 'daughter' being meek/responsible/modest in a submissive feminine way was expected. I wasnt allowed to cut my hair short, was forced to wear dresses to church until I was a teenager, and was punished if I didn't take on the feminine responsibilities of the household like cooking and cleaning (not saying those are actually feminine, but in the community I grew up in the other boys rarely had to help with these things, and I noticed). And I'll never forget the horror I felt when I realized people probably expected me to marry one of the other boys at our church. I'm bi, but I'd rather shoot myself in the head than be someones 'wife'.

As a result, it actually took me a long time to be sure I was trans - I was worried the root of my dysphoria was some kind of internalised misogyny. I have also noticed that in the work place, I've had to ""catch up"" - in the industries I've worked in assertiveness and confidence are key, and it was really difficult for me to do things like speak up in meetings or correct people. 

However, I am grateful that my experiences allow me to feel empathy for many of my female colleagues, and I feel that I can avoid some of the unintentional insensitive behaviours other men just dont notice.

FTMMen,fqt1j9b,t3_gkij1a,1589626757.0,"I guess I have three prominent feelings toward this kind of behaviour:

1. The terminology trans people have to work with is...well, convoluted to say the least.There are constant squabbles over man/male, transman/transmasculine, transgender/transsexual, etc. The thing is, I understand that these differing terms exist for a reason, that reason being that having deep discussions about gender theory requires them. But that doesnt mean everyone will use them the same way in practise.

2. I think there is a group of people online who are so deeply involved in the more theoretical aspects of trans topics that they kind of forget that a lot of us have to, you know, exist in the real world and reconcile our transness with it. My dysphoria isnt going away, no matter what theory of gender I espouse, and as a result when it comes to trans topics I'm mostly concerned about medical care. Likewise, I work with a bunch of cishet people and I'm not going to give a dissertation on gender theory every time someone asks about my transition so they can understand the nuances of trans identity. I'm a man, and I have some body parts that are physically/psychologically problematic for me, so me and my doctors are taking care of it. Just a regular dude with a health problem. There are of course more nuanced ways I have examined my gender identity,  but they are not what I work with day to day.

2. Also, just, basic respect? Like, I personally have no idea why someone without sexual dysphoria would want to transition, but that's ok, and I respect that they have an experience I dont share. I dont go around telling people how to think when they have a different experience from mine."
ask_transgender,fqptk50,t3_gjwq95,1589553719.0,"Hey! I'm a trans man in the process of getting a doctorate in computer science - welcome to the exclusive club of transgender academics ;)

I came out while in my first year, having come out in my personal life around 6 months before I did at the office - I waited until I was about to start HRT before I said anything at work...it gave me a practical reason to bring it up which helped with the anxiety. My advisor was very supportive and I dont think he's ever misgendered me since I came out, so I'm lucky in that sense. The administration has been polite and cooperative but there is only so much they can do with respect to official communication because I haven't changed my documents...I have to change my foreign birth certificate and passport before I get a new residence permit here, so that will take some time.

Anyway, if you want a few pointers, make sure to use your new name on publications as soon as you are sure of it (for me, I chose something with the same initials to bridge the gap), and try to have a pre-rehearsed explanation of your identity/being transgender - it helps in case someone randomly puts you on the spot. Try to find out if your campus has gender neutral washrooms for that in between period where you feel awkward whatever WC you choose, and try to find out what can be changed right away with respect to your new name (faculty website etc).

BDSMcommunity,fq3hrv1,t1_fq2wv4j,1589066586.0,"First off, the hot mess comment was comforting, because I definitely am one :)

I'll try to explain what seems appealing to me. There are certain things, like marking someone's body, that is like intrinsically appealing to me. Making designs with bite marks  or even just using a marker is weirdly appealing. The idea of someone asking/begging for something  and deciding how/when/if to respond is also appealing. I dont like degrading or insulting people unless I genuinely mean to criticize them, so that doesnt interest me, but the idea of following a strict set of rules and imposing prescribed rewards or punishments is kind of comforting. I also just really like having control over a partners body, and being able to just fixate on the bone structure of their face and their hands is relaxing and sensual for me. Another I think that matters to me is bei ng able to get what I want without feeling selfish. I'm paranoid about being selfish or arrogant, and I feel like awareness of oneself in that manner is another aspect if control.

Something I guess I could add is that one social role that has always come natural to me is that of a teacher.  Its something I'm very passionate about and that probably has some kind of unconscious psychological basis."

The USSR was responsible for the famine - I think most people agree on that considering the economic and rationing policies that were put in place just prior. Furthermore, the cover up was a significant feat of propaganda dissemination - this is also pretty indisputable. 

The degree of intentionality is the main point of contention. There is continuing scholarly debate on the topic and to call one side a conspiracy theory is unnecessarily inflammatory. There is a lot of controversy on how to apply the definition of genocide in historical and legal scholarship, and acknowledging this applies to discussions of the Holomodor isnt giving credence to a ""conspiracy theory"". My personal view is that Stalin could be said to be complicit in the genocide of Ukrainians due to the instigation of the famine, followed by a lack of aid and cover up. I haven't looked through enough records on communications between the Ukraine and Soviet officials to say anything definitive about the question of genocide."

I have a support system in my new country, and they don't need my active participation in family matters to survive.

So I came out...and was shocked by the support and love I got. My family is pretty hardcore religious so I was expecting something between unofficial disownment and dismissal, but they were more than willing to learn about my trans identity and try to understand what I was going through. Not everyone was so accepting back home, but my parents and sister, at least, have been wonderful, and we've never been closer.

I don't know what your situation is exactly, but if you're not financially or emotionally reliant on your family, I think the best option is to be open and honest, and approach the confrontation without expectations.

I was really young when I realized I hated being a girl, but then I looked at the women in my community, who did chores all day and had to take care of babies, and my first reaction to my dysphoria was ""of course I don't want to be a girl! Who would? All these women in my life who claim to feel comfortable with their femininity are putting on a brave face for the younger girls. I want to be a boy because growing into a woman will be hell on earth. They pretend being a girl is this great experience to con us into wanting to serve men."" It was all a conspiracy to me. Pairing that attitude with the constant self doubt I had from seeing things other people didn't as a kid, and I had very little confidence in the validity of my feelings.

I have mixed feelings about institutionalized gatekeeping for trans health care, but for my part, I do appreciate that I had to go through extensive therapy to make sure my gender dysphoria was divorced from my other issues. I have CPTSD (due partially to sexual abuse), social anxiety, and schizoaffective disorder, so my doctors understood the importance of separating my experiences with my gender identity from other factors. It's been frustrating waiting for hormones, but for me it was worth it. I'm doing HRT now, and due to the amount of research and psychotherapie I've done, I'm able to separate my experiences suffering as a trans person from my experiences suffering as a mentally ill or traumatized person. It's very helpful to separate delusions of self hatred from hating my body's sexual characteristics, and I think it's made my experience on hormones better. I haven't expected testosterone to solve problems in my life it won't solve, but the small things like not being disgusted by the size of my hips, being more willing to speak in public, and getting excited about facial hair are all the more joyful because I can value them for what they are."
asktransgender,fjkh44w,t3_fdpa20,1583426726.0,"Preach.

In my adolescence/early adulthood I dealt with poverty, mental illness, and being trans. I've always been hyper-aware that the fact that my parents didn't decide to move to Texas from Canada and the fact that I pursued my career in the EU instead of the US has been a big part of the arguable success I have today as a young adult. Even the smallest policy changes with regards to health care, social security, and social justice can have massive effects on the more marginalized people in society, and people should really think long and hard about how much they sound like a fucking sociopath when they idly comment on how voting is pointless and the system sucks so they don't have to do anything at all."
Socialism_101,fjaum31,t1_fja8zmy,1583180920.0,"Yeah, because Canada is a socialist country.

An argument can be made that Canada is an arguably successful socially democratic country, socialist it is not. 

That being said, an argument can also be made for baby steps, and at least (mostly) universal healthcare and a decent social safety net is an improvement on the US system."
asktransgender,fhiuuy7,t3_f3ahgn,1581632297.0,"Honestly, even before I came out as trans, I dated both trans masc and trans female people...and I still enjoy seeing both body types in erotic media.

Imo, it depends on intent. For me, I love seeing trans bodies in erotic media both because they are beautiful, and because they make me feel less self conscious about my own body. If you find something attractive,  I see no reason why you shouldn't indulge in it safely, provided there aren't any glaring issues with your attraction. Enjoy the human body and what you see as beautiful :)"
asktransgender,ffniyvi,t3_eu4ov1,1580066533.0,"Only one person has done this with me...but it was my first meeting with an ex of mine who I hadn't spoken to in over 5 years because of some fucked up shit that went down between us. We'd both come a long way since, and considering the person I was last time I spoke to him, I kind of appreciated the gesture. Our dynamic pre-fallout was pretty fucked, and he's straight (I'm ftm), so I kind of actually appreciated him approaching our meeting that way.

That being said, had it been anyone else, I would have been pretty annoyed, I think. it's pretty presumptuous imo to assume that since you saw a trans person as their innitially assigned gender before they came out, you didn't know them. Personally, I shared the parts of myself that I felt mattered with my friends and colleagues before coming out; yes, I'm a bit more direct about some things now, but it's not like I was deceiving them before I came out."
asktransgender,fexf8rk,t3_eqt3tn,1579430029.0,"The way I explain it to people is that I don't see intentional misgendering/transphobia as something as simple as ""calling me something I don't like"" - I see it as an accusation. It's someone else accusing me of being (a) delusional, or (b) a liar. That might not be their intention, but if you use some abductive reasoning to follow the motivations for transphobia, that's where it has to come from, from an ideological standpoint.

Transphobia is essentially someone explicitly disrespecting my and my community on a very basic level. While a lot of cis people wouldn't feel upset if someone on the street came up and referred to them with the wrong pronoun, they might feel differently if someone started calling them and everyone like them delusional liars."

asktransgender,fbqnche,t3_ee38ku,1577033385.0,"My parents are devoutly Christian as well, and I have had to explain trans identity to them (and their pastor) from a 'biblical perspective'. These are the things I have emphasized:

1. the Bible does not reference trans people. There is no mention of any phenomenon resembling transness in the bible. However, the Bible talks about the results of original sin, such as being born blind, or without the ability to walk. I portrayed the fact that I felt I was born with the wrong body as a similar thing. If they're at least somewhat scientifically aware you could talk about how all fetuses start off without a biological sex, but as most Christians teach, they start off with a soul. You could talk about how it's conceivable that you were created with a female soul but due to hormones in the womb etc your body ended up developing as male. To be clear, I don't buy this explanation at all, but it does appeal to what a lot of Christians believe.
2. God, throughout the Bible, emphasizes the importance of the soul, of your internal beliefs and feelings over the physical realities of the body. Your soul is what goes to heaven, not your body. In your spirit/soul/heart, whatever, you know that you are a woman, and that is the reality God cares about most.
3. God created men and women with different roles (again, I don't buy this, but they probably do) which they are best suited for. However, you feel you are best suited for the role of a woman. Rather then performing poorly in a role not meant for you, and suffering because of it, wouldn't God rather you thrive as a woman?

That's the main gist of what I talked about. Overall, they (and even their pastor) have turned out to be both accepting and supportive. My mom is even talking about flying all the way across the globe so she can take care of me when I get top surgery, lol.

Best of luck, and if you need any advice/input from someone who knows way more Christian theology than they want to, feel free to DM me :)"

schizoaffective,fb59nd8,t3_ebbkgn,1576523581.0,"I agree with others who have said you shouldn't give up. That being said, you need to be realistic - this doesn't mean lower your expectations, though...it means approach your expectations strategically.

Part of schizoaffective disorder is ups and downs - some people can manage this with a healthy lifestyle and medication...but I'm not one of those people. The best I can do is have back up measures in place for when the inevitable downs arrive to fuck up my life.

Running a company is a really difficult career choice for someone with SZA, imo - it's unpredictable, high-stress, and there isn't much room for fuck ups. That doesn't mean it's not possible, though. What I would suggest is to find one or two collaborators to found your company with, who are at least somewhat aware of your situation. I think this is important for two main reasons:

1. Accountability. Being accountable to other people is important; if you have too much freedom, it's far too easy to lock yourself away for days or weeks, or just give up. Having someone around who can be understanding when required, and give you a kick in the pants at other times, can be really useful for maintaining a sense of responsibility and applying pressure where needed.
2. Sometimes, you *will* need time off. That's just the way it is. Usually I can work for 2-3 months without any issues, and then have some sort of breakdown, and need some time off. If you're running a company, you're going to need someone to pick up the slack at times like this - someone you can trust to do the job in such a way that you don't have to worry while you should be resting.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. I hope everything goes well for you! Feel free to hit me up if you want to chat ever :)"

AskAcademia,fau1fb7,t3_eae0j8,1576343446.0,"I think that rather than trying to guess if there's some sort of underlying meaning to her words, you should just ask. I don't think it would come across badly to just ask her if her concern is your ability to do research, or the job prospects in your field, or something else. Over the years I've struggled a lot with poor self esteem and was constantly reading further into the words of teachers/bosses than I should have - it took me too long to realize that asking in a calm, neutral, respectful way if there was something else they wanted to communicate is much better than wasting your mental energy and time on trying to decipher someone else's words.

That being said, I do think there is some merit to taking a break between undergraduate and graduate school to explore career options. It's one thing if you're 100% sure of what you want to do, but I find that most people aren't after their undergraduate degree. It's possible that there are career options out there that might be better for your life goals/personality in the long run, or even fields that you're not aware of yet that could prove to be interesting for you. Personally, I took a year off to work, save money, and develop my professional skills as a programmer after my bachelors degree, and another two years after my masters to develop my skills further and do independent research on fields I was interested in pursuing at a doctoral level. The result was that I came into my doctoral program with a lot of practical skills that my colleagues didn't have, as well as a very clear idea of what research I wanted to pursue, because I had taken the time to carefully define my interests.

A final thing to note is that while it's not uncommon for people to go back to school in their late twenties, their thirties, or even later to pursue a graduate degree, getting your first job in industry at 27 after graduate school and virtually no industry experience will be *extremely* hard in a lot of fields. Unless you go into a field where everyone needs to be in school that long in order to qualify (such as medical doctors), most of your competitors wills have at least 2-5 years of work experience by that age, and that can make a big difference. 

Tldr; you should ask your advisor about her reasoning if you're concerned about her comments, and you should strongly consider getting some work experience before grad school if you think it's possible that you might not stay in academia."
