I have finally just started to really accept myself as who I am, and I can only imagine that with these way the LGBT narratives are these days, will give this generation mental anguish, to say the least. For too long I've given myself anguish, no thanks to the establishment LGBT mafia, grief over being gay and conservative. I thought I was some kind of monster for being gay and Christian, and supporting traditional marriage, etc. I extremely pity those in that situation now who feel the way I do. My only hope is that they see past the BS pushed through the LGBT narratives -- God  knows, it's taken me way too long."

Even though I never have used THC carts, which appears to be causing these issues, I still threw my Juul away and have quit smoking — going on four weeks now, this on account of valuing my long term health. I would recommend you do the same.

HealthAnxiety,eyushkk,t3_cyh7lf,1567470966.0,"I would imagine that these counterfeit THC carts which are spiked, traced to these sudden vaping illnesses over the past month(s), are probably all coming in form a central location, probably Asia, and are more than likely produced over there, and shipped overseas here to the States in massive quantities. Vapes have been on the market for around ten years now, and really hasn't become popular until the last five years or so. If these cases were solely to blame on vaping, either nic or real THC, we would of heard about them by now. This is why I think these cases stem from the aforementioned.

Cigarettes in particular, because I use to smoke, can cause both short and long term respiratory issues (no shit), albeit nothing (debatable, but you get the point) as sudden as what we are seeing with these ""vapes"". The tobacco blended into cigarettes is checked with a fine tooth and comb before it ever leaves the factory.

You probably would of had symptoms by now, again as others have stated, the people who use these fake carts get their symptoms suddenly, now this is not to say that our actions of putting tobacco smoke, or THC vape smoke may or may not effect us in some shape or fashion down the road, I find it unlikely.
