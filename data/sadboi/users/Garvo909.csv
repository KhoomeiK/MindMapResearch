Not to be mean, but like, isn't that kind of obvious? The virus has 3 different names that are all as easy to pronounce and spell as ""ChinaVirus"", so it doesn't really make any sense that someone would just jump to using the unofficial name and not understand why calling a virus ChinaVirus, or even Russan virus (which I've never heard of) is at least kind of racist lmao but that's just my honest opinion on the whole thing plus Ebola wasn't anywhere near as deadly as coronavirus, but the symptoms were terrifying so there is that."
