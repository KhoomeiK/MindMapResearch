If I was able to make more money it would be closer to a dream job.. I guess. That’s just because it’s easy and I can make my own hours. I hate the thought of having to work my life a way. “Work to live not live to work”. 

My job isn’t miserable but I have worked places that made me miserable and cry though. Which is why I will hopefully never ever go back to retail.


I also find that turning your hobbies into a dream job can make you not like them. So the saying, “find something you love and you will never work a day in your life”, really isn’t true. I started a blog about traveling just as a hobby. I ended trying to turn it into something where I could make money. It made me not want to write or travel anymore. It just wasn’t as enjoyable. 

I don’t know though. I still feel like if I had a critter catching job, It would make me pretty happy. I just probably would never want to go out and herp, bird watch anymore as a hobby if it’s something I did because I had too. I just don’t know without giving it a try."

It’s getting to see people do all the things I want in life. It doesn’t help that I am financially struggling. 

I am not really alone and I have lots of interests. I garden, I hike, etc (I just don’t like doing them alone.) My husband and I go on birding field trips with other people. I sometimes volunteer at a community garden on Saturdays. 

The problem is I work from home as a pet sitter so Monday-friday I am at the house all day. When my husband comes home we eat dinner together and then he will go play games and discgolf. We have a specific day we always hang out on and he doesn’t game or anything and when I am having a really bad day he spends time with me. 

It’s when he’s gaming or out and I feel like I am stuck at the house. I hate being alone. I mean I HATE it. I feel like I could give more back story but this is already sooo long. 

I even have a friend that comes over on most Fridays and we go out or hang at the house. I am loved and have friends and family. 

I have even decided to help myself. I am going to find a workout buddy to go walk at the park with in the evenings so I am doing things outside of my husband. I am super dependent on him.

Rain water is always the best to use as it has all the nutrients(this goes for any plants). You must use the water soon because the nutrients can dissipate. (Lots of stuff about oxygen or gas that I can’t remember.)

Basically, water once every two weeks if in a container that holds moisture. You do not have to bath/dip “airplants” like most people advise. These types of plants soak up water through the leaves/flower not roots. You may need to water more depending how hot or how much light they are getting.
