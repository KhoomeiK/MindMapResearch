DeadBedrooms,fabqkrc,t3_e8burz,1575927220.0,"Be forward. Tell her. Show her. It's a little hard to resist an oiled up cock and balls. Do you shave? Because that could also factor into it... Maybe sometime you should wait for the kids to be asleep or gone,  sit in bed, oil your meat up (coconut oil gives off an almost irresistible smell) and just massage and toy with it until it's throbbing . Then text/call her. Ask her to come in, you need her for something. Maybe a ""please "" would be nice. I doubt she could resist that. I doubt I could resist that. Just a pitch. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

raisingkids,f8ca27s,t1_f8c8m65,1574455912.0,"Having a solid bond with your kid has a glorious impact on obedience and trust. Try a trust building activity before homework time. It can be draining to be a parent but you need to remember that they're a little person figuring things out still. try a game of hide and seek, a quick yoga session, or sitting down with your kid and watching a funny YouTube video. These things are small, quick, and can have a good impact on your relationship with your child. These things show your child that you enjoy spending time with them and that's very important."

If he gets all three checked off for a day, every day for a week, he gets something cheap and easy that he likes. Like candy, a food he likes, or he gets to go somewhere he likes to go to. If there isn't anything fitting that category, take privelages from him and only let him indulge in those said privelages if he's been doing his work."
