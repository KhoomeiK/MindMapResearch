AskReddit,fr0ygkx,t3_glr6jd,1589809610.0,"Dreamfall. I cant really describe why but it would be a great one to study/interpret. The game involves dream consoles - where you can dream up anything you'd like - which end up being addictive. The consoles also take personal information from your dreams and relay it to the government. I described the premise poorly as there's much more to the gane than that. But yeah, it's good. A lot of themes in there."

1800slayyyter,fo9jbq9,t3_eh8hq3,1587621173.0,I was (maybe still am - it's complicated) a fan of her music. You have a reason to be mad. She didn't address the issue properly. Quite frankly she even managed to make the apology about herself (which celebrities never fail to do). It kind of makes me think that her behaviour was passed down from her family - hence why she thought it wasn't wrong to post those things but it seemed really out of character. You know what's weird? One of her favourite books is To Kill a Mockingbird. She should go back and read it. Unbelieveable.
