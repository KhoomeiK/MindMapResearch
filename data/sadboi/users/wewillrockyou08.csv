selfimprovement,f77zs52,t3_due3gz,1573481269.0,"In a similar situation! I think about switching majors every time there's an exam. Not many people are 100% sure on what to do don't worry.

I know how shitty it is being a perfectionist. It's really hard to focus on school with all your attention when you got other mental stuff going on. 

Just keep trying your best! It's all you can do. Work on a schedule, try to meet people with similar interests to feel less lost maybe?"
selfimprovement,f5woi00,t3_dpj7k6,1572527839.0,"I had a similar thing except I would only day stuff like that to gfs. I felt too embarrassed to ask for advice to friends. I always felt the need to ask that everything was okay and what to do. 

I was so reliant and when they inevitably broke up with me I would feel lost and anxious for months. 

What has helped me:
1 - detailed schedule everydat, so that I know what to do and when to do it 
2 - journaling and trying to remind myself that it's not the end of the world and that things are going well
2 - building confidence. So working out, studying , etc 

I still got alot to work on so don't think anyone has all the answers ."
Anxiety,f5nsb15,t3_doem5t,1572303588.0,"Feel the exact same way. I'm so stressed currently and just everything is hitting at once. I was doing fine for a the first bit of uni and now I feel like I just want to die. 

Both my grandparents got sick , I had 2 exams and 2 labs the same day and then my gf broke up with cause I stressed her out too much. 

I'm trying so hard. I study just has hard as my peers for the exams but I do 20% worse it's ridiculous. I went to an exam review session for genetics and I made the dumbest mistakes , I knew the answer I was just so stressed that anything that seemed somewhat right I said yes too or i completely over thought.

I cried in the car like an actual child once I got home. Like bruh why am I so I'll adjusted. I'm on a waiting list for 3 months to see my psychiatrist, which doesn't help much regardless


But, I know what you and I gotta do... Exactly whatever one says workout, take meds or get help etc, sleep better, eat drink water, try to do fun things, breathe and keep studying 

I just hope I couple bad days make me feel even worse and I lose all hope"
Anxiety,f4ioy9w,t3_dkp7l8,1571607482.0,So true! Flipping back to old pages of my journals that I've been writing in for years really reminds me how far is come and I feel a tiny bit better
Sourdough,f44rgs8,t3_dj917f,1571357487.0,"So wonderful to see a meme about bread. I was doing work on yeast in my genetics course in uni too, Kept sniffing the agar plates, which was probably not great for me, but they smelt great."

Anxiety,f3wslk0,t1_f3wfj3l,1571218994.0,For me personally it's right on my sternum
BreakUps,f3vb917,t1_f3v9k0a,1571173844.0,Thanks man. You are right. I already take meds for anxiety and stuff like that. I deleted her on anything and just gonna try to cool off. I think it's already to late and I'm sure I nagged her too much. Don't have too much self respect but I'm trying dammit
Anxiety,f3r6h2s,t1_f3r5dt8,1571084841.0,Thanks! I'll check it out. It's so cloudy out rn . Imma take a break from working on genetics and workout. Wish you the best
Anxiety,f3r4kf8,t1_f3r3pef,1571084343.0,"Yeah I have been writing my my journal alot more recently and trying to make more time for friends. Unfortunately I've already talked to my now ex about it and I felt really pathetic cause of it. Regardless you are right. I no longer feel like my anxiety/depression is gonna kill me, but it's just baggage I want to shed. As for therapist. I haven't seen her in a while. I should probs see her sometime . Thanks for responding from the void friend :)"
Anxiety,f3qiwom,t3_dhsybu,1571075468.0,So proud of you! I've been having a shitty week but we can do it !
Anxiety,f3qipf2,t3_dhskja,1571075372.0,It's always my chest.. it sucks so bad. Putting vaporub or some peppermint oil helps alot. At least for me. It's worth a shot
selfimprovement,f3oe7cv,t1_f3obvf8,1571015522.0,"Maybe . She does have anxiety and wasn't in an okay  is having a tough time id hate to just blame her to feel better and I was great for a while before it. Nothing every black and white I'm sure it's a little bit of anything . 

I do have a special lamp that I use to study often. Not sure if it's a sun lamp as you said I just kinda went to the pharmacy and got a winter sadness lamp thing it's called ""thermalite.""

 Anyways I have so many things but I feel like I so far from where I want to be. Gotta keep at it this I suppose. Thanks for the response it did help me maybe not glorify this girl too much . Goodluck with your stuff guy"

I feel uper alone and insecure not doing anything so clubs during the school year and a part-time job rn helps alot. It also can help you make more friends and the such! Gl!"

I've been a similar goal thing before, but I usually do checklists. I've been trying to gain weight so every pound I've made a checkbox for and going to the gym. I definitely think the spreadsheet is better tho cause I can do it everyday instead of just a vague timeframe. Maybe an agenda could work as well"

My trick is to blast music and sing along as loud as I can to stop myself from thinking . Also when I'm just bored at home I force myself to keep busy. Apply for a job, volunteer at things or even do things alone that don't make you feel sad. Reading and drawing works for me. :) I went through a bad breakup a couple months ago that left me with no friend group in my lectures, but as I joined random clubs I managed to meet some really great friends and kept myself from beating myself up!"
