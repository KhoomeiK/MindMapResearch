AskReddit,fip8kdv,t3_f8rn5x,1582600435.0,"For my wedding, we booked a block of rooms for the wedding party and family/friends at the same hotel (very nice 4 star one). We asked for a nice suite for us (the bride and groom) and were assured we would have a special one. Imagine our surprise when we checked in and realized they put us in a suite connected to my dad’s hotel room! Like our two rooms were part of the same suite. Literally the absolutely last room I’d want to be in on my wedding night. And they were completely booked so there were no other rooms available. We ended up switching rooms with my brother but I was furious."
AMA,fip69qx,t1_fip4sbb,1582598965.0,I was wondering about how he divided holidays as well
breakingmom,filn4wv,t1_fcb54v0,1582505535.0,I was thinking AFRID as well. There is a Facebook support group for it so it might be a good place to connect with other parents who have been in your shoes. Your story sounds very similar to some I’ve seen there. I thought my son might have it for a while but now think he has something different. I’m so sorry you are going through this!

Also, I’m so sorry that this happened to you."
AMA,ff36odl,t3_ere8pq,1579534968.0,"First of all, I’m so sorry that you experienced that. I’m glad you are safe now. 

Do you have siblings and if so, were they abused as well?

Also, what was your mother’s childhood like? Any ideas about what contributed to her being abusive? (Like drugs, history of abuse, etc)."
Anxiety,fep63a1,t3_eq5lp4,1579312960.0,"Yes, For me the scariest part is the unknown (of where you go, what it’s like) and that it’s completely out of my control."
AMA,fell1xz,t1_fekyn4k,1579224731.0,Is that when your parents found out too or had they known since you were born?
AskReddit,fdm03nz,t3_elssvy,1578536628.0,"I asked my grandpa to read me a story as a kid and he told me he’d love to but couldn’t because he didn’t know how to read. My whole childhood, i tiptoed around it because I didn’t want him to feel bad. Fast forward 30 years to when he passes away. Around the funeral, everyone was talking about his life accomplishments and I added “it’s really amazing all that he accomplished, given that he was illiterate and all”. Everyone was like “wtf are you talking about?!”. Turns out that fucker just wasn’t in the mood to read me a story that day lol."

AMA,fbwr0zp,t3_eeh5r0,1577157150.0,I would really encourage your sister to tell them soon. My husband found out he was adopted by accident as an adult and it really fucked him up. It will come out eventually and they will resent her for keeping it from them.
Anxiety,fbwof6n,t3_eer2xv,1577155204.0,"I’ve had anxiety about death as long as I can remember and while I’m not super religious, it really helped me to read the book Proof of Heaven about a neurosurgeon who wrote about his near death experience. It just made death sound pleasant and not scary and somehow made me less anxious about it. https://www.amazon.com/Proof-Heaven-Neurosurgeons-Journey-Afterlife/dp/1451695187/ref=asc_df_1451695187/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312174487654&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12870437313221062486&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061285&hvtargid=aud-801381245258:pla-434634421156&psc=1"

I know it seems impossible right now, and it will be really really hard to get there, but you can do it and I really believe in you."
addiction,fbfg8h8,t1_fbddzfg,1576809834.0,"Sorry, one more question if you don’t mind. In the past, her withdrawal was more shaking, extreme discomfort, pain, anxiety, insomnia. Can the withdrawal symptoms change from episode to episode?"
addiction,fbff6gp,t1_fbb6p87,1576809097.0,"I asked the nurse about serotonin syndrome and he kind of blew off the idea. Seems worth looking into to me because she takes tramadol, an SSRI, and also Zofran which I also read can contribute to serotonin syndrome. So frustrating when the doctors won’t listen to you and nobody looks at the big picture vs the individual symptoms. I’m going to bring it up again tomorrow."
addiction,fbfer89,t1_fbc3pce,1576808800.0,"She’s still delirious 3 days later in the hospital and she’s been on IV fluids so I don’t think it would be dehydration but she tested positive for c-diff so there is definitely a gut infection. The hospital doctor thinks it’s unrelated to the delirium though. Which seems unlikely to me, but I really don’t know what to think."
addiction,fbfeix7,t1_fbddzfg,1576808641.0,Ok I didn’t know that. Do you think she would still be delirious 3 days later from withdrawal?
addiction,fbfeewv,t1_fbcwu54,1576808566.0,She is 67
addiction,fbb4ty0,t1_fbb2upg,1576693327.0,Yes she also takes an antidepressant so that could definitely be it. I was actually reading about this yesterday but assumed the doctor would have looked at that since he can see all the meds she takes (and shame on me for assuming that!). Really appreciate the suggestion - I will ask about this.
addiction,fbazt20,t3_ec6j2q,1576690307.0,"I don’t have any advice but just wanted to say that you are not alone. I’m in the same situation and also struggling to get through to my mom. Her problem is with opiates which she is prescribed and like your mom, justifies her pill abuse because they come from a doctor. It has ruined her life and is traumatizing our (her children’s) lives. It’s so painful to watch and to not be able to do anything about it. Hang in there, I know how tough it is."
addiction,f8x1f8e,t1_f8w3hwq,1574905644.0,"She is on medicare which can be tricky to find places that take it. But if she was willing to go, I think my siblings and I would just find a way to make it happen even if we have to take out a loan. Thanks so much for the informations."
addiction,f8x1a96,t1_f8w2jen,1574905538.0,Thanks so much. I will look into the book.
addiction,f8vmqvq,t1_f8vmjoh,1574872928.0,"Thank you, I will look into that! The only inpatient program she did was just detox and only 1 week, I don’t think it was medication assisted. They did recommend she go to rehab next but she wouldn’t go."
