bangladesh,fnprd8q,t1_fnojebv,1587150592.0,"Dude shit happens. I basically make music (beats) 24/7 and I cannot survive without it at all.

 My laptops got broken quite a few time and my third laptop stopped working just a month before quarantine.
I lost all my fucking songs and everything because I dropped my hard disk as well(just a bunch of fucked up mental shit)
Now I gotta wait till the shops open and spend my whole quarantine without it.

I really feel fucked up but what can I do anyways.
It's hard but now I'm kinda getting the hang off it.

I hope this helps somewhat and I also hope you're doing good."
