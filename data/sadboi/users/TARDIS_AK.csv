anchorage,fq5so2g,t1_fq5b6s8,1589116385.0,"I love how it says ""95% of the facility is filterated"". Then why the hell did they buy a larger facility just so we can ""breathe better""? He would literally say ""there will be more space and people will breathe better"", everytime we had a meeting about moving a team over to the new location . The place they bought wasn't much better than the original location. The only difference was it was a little bigger, but that facility ended up having poor filterateration as well.."
anchorage,fq52xow,t1_fq50lqq,1589090861.0,"Some of us wore PPE. I have some things documented from that time, but it's not enough. They could have chose to modify and renivate their original location than buying an entire warehouse full of useless weed, a lot of people would have breathed a lot better. But it is what it is, they move their money in shady ways.

It wasn't my crew, I merely worked there as a long time employee. Many of us brought many problems to people's attention and nothing was done. Some of us eventually quit or were fired."

anchorage,fq4rtm6,t1_fq4r9fw,1589082675.0,It was sold at their stores under RC Tinderbox's name until the official switch over because all the moldy weed was grown by RC Tinderbox. I remember Bowser as one of the strains that was sold.
anchorage,fq4qt5c,t1_fq4q2e2,1589082014.0,"When I worked there (this is the exact time period this happened), we packaged grams, eighths, quarters, half ounces and ounces of this crap and sold it. We used used every drop of it and did not extract it.

Edit: I have listened to the audio about four times now. And I worked there for 2 years."
anchorage,fq4nu7r,t1_fq4n4kd,1589080132.0,"1) RC Tinderbox was for sale and GNC bought them. They operated as RC Tinderbox for awhile until completely switching over as GNC. 

2) It depends on the environment the cannabis is being grown in or harvested in. Usually humidity plays a big part in that. 

3) Well, they could have swapped samples. Calling this strain that and boom new results.

Edit: RC Tinderbox was a cannabis cultivation that was for sale."
anchorage,fq4fg1o,t1_fq4eszn,1589077080.0,"I worked for them and I witnessed and many others witnessed this whole thing. I packaged the questionable product.

You're absolutely right, not every cultivation runs the same and not every product you buy from a dispensary is going to be a consistently great product.
