But then I tell myself, you re just making excuses, go do it.

And then I hear myself say; I don't like dealing with people but I do like helping them and my brain just spins around thinking about it all."

I stopped K2 and then picked it up again but then stopped and watched the end. Lolz. I have to stop doing that! 

I sound like this happens all the time but honestly,  I do watch entire series 😁

I'll go back to Kingdom. 👍

Let's Eat 1 and 2 aren't too bad. It taught me a lot about how to eat Korean food; what to mix with what.  Let's Eat 1 ... the ""ugly"" office girl is hilarious. I absolutely love her."
kdramarecommends,fnklq7j,t1_fnfxzf8,1587031888.0,"Yeah. Keep going. All the little mysteries come together and the last ep. is worthwhile. I even kept a screenshot of the last scene it was so poignant.

Lee Minho ... yeah, he's quite wooden and she is really annoying but don't you love the king and queen? I really like them together as you progress through."

I didn't really like her character in that drama but I wished they had have made her less kooky in Wok of Love. It could have been a great part for her character to grow and learn. But nooooo. They had to give her that stoopid horse 🤗

I can't believe you went back for a ""second helping"" 😁. But I know what you mean trying to give a drama a second chance. I did it with The K2 and will do it for Kingdom now that there's a series 2 out! Something must be working for it."

I love the Viki Ratuken side comments from viewers. Was watching an old drama where one character was always sad and complaining and her cute little doggo came up to her and ran off again when she got sad and a viewer wrote, ""Even her dog is sick of her sh*t "" was funny at the time!"
KDRAMA,fidmhiu,t1_fibu0b2,1582368801.0,They also dressed him up like a grandpa with those awful cardigans and shoes which kinda took away from his action scenes.   He looked MUCH better in his latest.
