BPD,fkfjmzs,t3_fi06qa,1584135870.0,"I was doing this a lot so I stopped (2 days clean) and I'll try to stay off it until I get a better handle on my mental with my coping skills. Still, I'm two days in and it's the start of a weekend so we will see. I feel you though"
BPD,fjxnkv0,t3_ffbofr,1583678786.0,"I can relate, and I don't know how to fix it. I just try to be upfront with the people I care about the most and then try to be non judgemental about how I am with others. I think overtime as I set more boundaries in my life and stuff it will get better. You're not alone in how you feel"
BPD,fjxna1h,t1_fjwk51m,1583678557.0,You hit the nail on the head. I was feeling this way too and had to cut out everyone in my life who isn't trying To better themselves. It's been a lot easier for me since then because it feels a lot less futile and isolating.
BPD,fjxmnbs,t3_ff8ckq,1583678065.0,"Thanks everyone for your responses. I was high the two times it happened so am thinking I should lay off the weed until I'm in a more stable place. 

It feels really comforting to know it's not just a me thing"
BPD,fir8d62,t3_f9ch7m,1582659398.0,"Yup! A car door slamming. A truck passing. Thunder, an airplane toilet flushing... What I hate most is the sound of a hand dryer in a small public bathroom. I've been trapped before just covering my ears in the stall until the noise stopped long enough to rush out wash my hands and leave. It's seriously anxiety inducing"
BPD,fiqcfjz,t1_fiq68kd,1582641074.0,Yea I agree with that. I looked around and settled on this group after getting diagnosed with BPD for the second time (and finally accepting it) specifically because it seems to have a good community with strong admins. Thanks for providing input and congratulations on overcoming some of those fears! I hope I can stick with it and not give in to peer pressure to get back on.
BPD,fiqbsnw,t1_fiq1h4v,1582640625.0,"It's good to know that a year in you feel a marked improvement in your life. Most days I don't feel anything, and the social media hits have really been emphasizing the spirals and boredom. I'm hoping this can be a positive step in healing for me. Tha ks for sharing ♥️ I appreciate your input"
BPD,fiqbnsq,t1_fipmdhs,1582640528.0,"Thanks! Their monopoly terrifies me because even though I think I escaped it, they own WhatsApp too - my main form of communication with my loved ones. As I said above, it is day 1, but it's just another addiction that I have to pull myself away from. Most of my friends and colleagues can't understand it because they think I'm exaggerating, so thanks for the support. It will be easier to stay away knowing others are this affected too."
BPD,fiqbgwf,t1_fiptbw3,1582640392.0,Yea I tend to internalize what I see and just spiral. It's good to know that it is the right decision even if that means I have to start shifting away from communications professionally. Thank you for sharing ♥️
BPD,fiqbd5l,t1_fipe35w,1582640317.0,"Yeah, you're absolutely right. I woke up this morning feeling much more free and drank some water while I played with my dogs before getting ready for work - instead of the usual fetal position Facebook hit. I know it feels so life changing because it's Day 1 (and most Day 1s feel amazing) but you are right. Social media has been a nightmare. Plus, I do forget that there are other less manipulative ways to get information and stay connected to the goings on online. I'll stick with this decision I think. Thanks a lot for the input♥️"
BPD,fi9j20o,t3_f74c1a,1582267732.0,"Hey Hope, 

I too joined tonight because I got diagnosed earlier this week and have suspected since my teens that I have BPD. I started therapy again this year because I had a major panic attack and then a strong but short period of depression. Then a burst of energy. Then repeat. 

All the symptoms fit and I guess the scariest thing for me is that I don't know if normal is possible. It all seems like a lot of work and I don't have a support network that is strong enough to help me through this. 

So yes. I 100% relate, down to an intense codependent relationship ending in November with a guy I felt like I fell in love with after two very intense weeks. He gave similar reasons as you mentioned and I was told once again I am too intense. 

Anyway, I am here for the same reason and your post kinda calmed me a bit so thanks a lot for sharing. It helped me and I hope this helps you."
BPD,fi9hso0,t3_f763rk,1582266376.0,"I'm in a similar situation right now and it's greatly affecting my ability to work and maintain connections. I am therefore in no place to give anyone advice, but I can say I am sorry you are going through this and you aren't alone. You sound absolutely exhausted and if it helps, when I catch myself shutting down, I am forcing myself to engage in mindfulness in a safe space. I am also seeing my therapist weekly and keep those sessions as a kind of beacon to break up the ceaseless cycling. Worse comes to worst I just write my stream of consciousness through the fog to get some clarity. 

I hope this message can help you in some way. All the best ♥️"
