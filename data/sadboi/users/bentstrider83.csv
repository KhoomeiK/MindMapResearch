Best bet would be a training company like Schneider or Prime Inc. Training program is quite thorough and as long as you stay away from the lease, a year on with either will be free training.

I don't if it was just where I used to live in CA(High Desert), but there were very few gun shops around and most seemed very exclusive when it came to a new customer. Going to some gun friendlier states like UT and NM definitely had a different vibe. You could actually hold the merch and despite not being a resident at the time, the staff in these two states did everything they could to explain ownership steps to you.


Fast forward to 2012 where I finally moved from CA to NM and it's been a few purchases every other year since.

Interestingly enough, the thought of over crowding and disease related woes is what kind of dropped the ball on an urban move.

Went shopping and to the gym during times where the crowd was minimal. Avoiding any place that appeared to have something going on, those sorts of things.  


But since I drive a truck for a job, I still have to go out. I do what I can to keep my contact to only those that need it. I keep my face covered, grab my papers from dispatch, and get to where I need to go. If anything, I begin to panic when someone is coming towards me to ""say hi"" or just wants to talk. I've had a couple of outbursts over the past, few weeks telling people to keep their distance. And finally a panic attack this morning.  


I honestly feel like the ""deprived extroverts"" are ""out to get me"". It's nerve wracking."
introvert,fmyv5pg,t3_fxblup,1586496730.0,"I drive semi trucks as a job in rural NM, so I got to leave the house when there's tankers to be moved. I drive locally, but I'm either shuttling trailers between empty drop lots, or getting tankers unloaded at a pretty sterile facility where we just chill inside the truck.  
The only thing I did with other people were these ""social night bicycle rides"" I'd travel all the way up to Boulder or down to Austin for. I was already kind of limited on doing those due to distance, fuel costs, and vehicle wear. So after the organizers put the kibosh on them until further notice, it was quite easy to take it in and do without.  
Staying at home when I'm not working is pretty easy. Hit my weight set, play with my trains, and just take long naps to pass the times away. Of course it would be nicer if I was further out in the boonies. All in all, I'm handling it pretty well and could keep it up long after everything finally settles down."

introvert,fmvwfy1,t1_fmnkpqj,1586433222.0,"I drive semi trucks and only have to deal with security and intake personnel at the same plant I get my tanker unloaded at each night. Everyone's masked on and keeping their distance. Drivers stay in the truck and take a nap, play on phones., etc 

As far as shopping goes, I try to schedule an online order to be picked up later at a local grocery store. Roll up, pick up truck gets loaded and I'm gone. I've got absolutely no empathy for these crowds that can't just go in and get out at places like Wal Mart. Of course sadly, just like before the pandemic struck, they hang out there out of boredom. Managers need to put their foot down and kick em out."
introvert,fmvw0ei,t3_fw8h7a,1586432822.0,"I'm just like you, OP. Only go out for essentials when needed, head to work, and spots where I know there aren't a lot of people. Of course I also live in what could be considered the ""hub"" of a rural area of NM. While the pace of life is relaxed here, there's also alot of social butterflies in the area that crave interaction.

I made it my business to avoid crowded looking spots before all the panic. And now take more steps to do so. Once this all kind of mellows down to a more relaxed level, I'll be looking towards a move further out of town and out into the boonies."

mentalhealth,fmspo2g,t1_fmsdc6d,1586359971.0,"Most definitely. I also read up on recoveries and such. The news outlets, especially the ones here in the US, seem to thrive on sensationalism. For all the doom and gloom out there, the more fact filled, straight laced stories fall the way side.

While the state I currently live in, NM, seems to be handling the whole thing better than some, I've been appalled by the lack of care from most that live here in this stateline community. Being right next to TX, there exists that more militant ""my rights"" type of mindset that some just have to be proudly vocal of. Of course I've been dealing with that on some level since moving out here eight years ago. So again, really thinking the next best thing once this all settles down a bit is to run with my move into a further remote area.

Of course apart from a small subsistence garden, I'll probably have to look into some other profession that doesn't require leaving the future homestead much. Kind of a hard thing in and of itself to do when I barely graduated high school 19 years ago and have only recently managed to get my footing in a troubling subject like college algebra.

On the upside of things, I wouldn't call myself defeatist in taking this further isolating route. Never have been in a relationship and don't have kids of my own. So perhaps all those years of staying on the outside of that drama has somewhat prepped me."

mentalhealth,fmrznvx,t3_fx2qdr,1586341419.0,"I feel safer being at home. But have to go out due to being on the ""essential"" list and driving a semi. Luckily I don't come into much contact with people on the job, there's still the supply runs I got to make every few weeks. I've taken to either pickups of online orders for grocery, or going shopping when the store is noticeably empty.
Either way, I'm performing little self diagnosis on my self each day. And already looking at taking up gardening and looking at remote properties in the state once this all calms down. I felt I was getting over my social awkwardness. But now I feel like my old habits have turned back on and see the outbreak as an excuse to become permanently distant again."

thewalkingdead,fmntjpl,t1_fmiuxc5,1586234882.0,"And then on the other end of the spectrum, I could see those taking social distancing and spacing to extreme lengths. Someone starts getting too close to one of those people might end up getting popped."
liberalgunowners,fmmb7fx,t3_fvn7xs,1586202147.0,"There's three of them here in town. I only support this one that's inside a tool store since they seem to be pretty chill and have enough stock on hand to keep one coming back. Of course I haven't bought anything since last year, so I don't how it is now with the general chaos soup.
The other one is connected to a range and I go there occasionally. But it's a bit of a drive.
The third one just has people hanging out in there all the time flapping their gums about conspiracies and the usual, far right banter."

Both of them seem to follow the party line rhetoric to a T. And both of them are ardent supporters of 45.
But mention a firearm to them and you get read the riot act for why one shouldn't have it.

Of course both of them would shit bricks if they ever saw my collection. Then again they're back in CA and I'm in NM."

Then everything got switched over to online a few weeks ago. Dealing with it plus work(essential, driving trucks) has me unnerved.
I'm just going to drop it and get back to it whenever things begin to calm down."
