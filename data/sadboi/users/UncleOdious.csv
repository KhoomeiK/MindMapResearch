InfowarriorRides,fp7brmr,t1_fp6e736,1588367654.0,"tl;dr This isn't about a love of guns. It's about their personal definition of freedom, liberty, and Constitutional rights. It is a not so nuanced threat to those that would impose limits on their *personal* interpretation of the Constitution and the rights given therein.

I'd argue that this has very little to do with a like/love of guns, but rather it's a statement about ""freedom"" and ""liberty."" More specifically, it's about their strong belief that they are part of a small number of clear-headed, free-thinking, Americans (say, III% *wink, wink, nudge, nudge*) who *truly* know what the Constitution is and what the Government is for. This is about their belief that America is going (has gone?) to hell, the Government is tyrannical, and they will exercise their Constitutional rights (specifically 1A to talk about 2A) to reclaim the country for the ***REAL AMERICANS and PATRIOTS*** by fighting against what they perceive to be tyranny. 

Ironically, these folks are also likely to be huge supporters of the military and law enforcement, who they will likely be shooting at when they decide it is time to reclaim their American dream. 

To be clear, I do not endorse this display. Personally, I think such displays are clearly an  indication of a person with a persecution complex and a extremely narrow world view."
