I’m learning piano ($100 per year iPad subscription), biking (free since I own a bike), hanging out with my cats (free), watching movies with my partner (minimal cost) and doing meditation and yoga (free and free). I just feel mentally and physically healthier and I’ve realized that I can live off of very little. Cooking all meals at home has really helped too.

I hope that I can keep this up when I go back to work."

CanadianTeachers,fmf4533,t1_fmexvk9,1586019556.0,The French will really help you job-wise. It depends if your doing elementary or secondary. I did secondary but even in elementary French you will have many courses in French. Read up on the DEFL exam and the CECR before coming if you want to be ahead.
science,fmehht3,t1_fmdyjvt,1586004083.0,You are amazing at explaining !!!!
CanadianTeachers,fmeh1hf,t1_fmdm5az,1586003651.0,"I (see post above that I made for reference) am turning 29 this year as I graduate. I was 27 when I started the program. It does set you back financially and new teachers don’t make much (that’s if you even GET a job vs. Sitting on the supply list). Since I have French I know I’ll get a job quickly once this COVID stuff is over (plus my experience gained before teacher’s college) but I have non-French teacher friends who have been qualified for 8+ years and are still on the supply list/ doing the odd LTO. 

What are your priorities? 

Do you want a stable career with guaranteed advancement and immediate good pay? Do you have French/Biology? If no, it might be a long road for you  

Not to be a pessimist but I work for 3 different boards and this is the sad reality for most people. I am also a mature student and know the struggles..."
CanadianTeachers,fmegp88,t1_fmdmibf,1586003322.0,"The program is just tedious. I had already been an unqualified supply teacher (with 2 LTOs) under my belt) and knowing what I knew, I just didn’t feel teachers college and it’s courses were useful at all. They are mostly just busy work. It’s just a long 2 years. The tuition is also too expensive. 

BUT
A) you will make friends
B) practicums are great experience
C) you need the certificate to become a teacher, which is a great career

I should add that I have French which really helps. What are your teachable subjects?"

My program was entirely course-based plus performances so it was a lot of work, but the beauty of supplying is that you don't have to work if you are unable. When my coursework became heavy, I took the time off that I needed. Most principals seemed impressed by and okay with the fact that I had limited availability due to being a full-time student.

Another great perk is the dynamic between being both a student and a teacher at the same time. If anything, I felt it gave me an extra layer of understanding and compassion towards my students.

My social life definitely took a hit from working so hard but in the end the debt I avoided was worth it!"
