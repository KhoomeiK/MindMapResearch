I wish I‚Äôd done it earlier. 

When I woke up from that final surgery I woke up a little slowly. It was only an hour and a half, so super easy. We took my ovaries and cleaned up more endo. As I was waking up I kept expecting pain.

endometriosis,fjilwsf,t3_fdmfxw,1583370522.0,"Oh girlfriend. I am so sorry you are in this place. It gets better. Buckle up. Imma tell you my tale. 

I found out I had adenomyosis in 2016 after I had an excision lap with uterine biopsy. My surgeon had discussed this possibility at length so we agreed on a pre-sacral neurectomy while I was under. Recovery from surgery sucked the first couple of days from all the gas in my back and shoulders. That surgery was five hours. 

My adeno was the diffuse type. My uterine muscle was nothing but endo like tissue. If I‚Äôd had focal adeno the PSN might have given me more relief for longer. 

I went back to surgery with the same surgeon just over one year ago. She took out everything, even ovaries for mental health reasons. Surgery was fast and oh so easy. I woke up with no post surgical pain. It was my first taste of freedom from pain. That‚Äôs a fucking head rush - realizing there is nothing, no pain, just nothing. 

I‚Äôve been staunchly child free since I was about 10. Kids just weren‚Äôt the path I wanted. The closer I got to that surgery the more I started to freak out and wonder if I wasn‚Äôt making a huge mistake. That maybe I should push off the surgery to have a kid. The surgery was just so massive and final to me at that point. 

It‚Äôs your lizard brain hanging onto that last shred of urge to procreate. I had to remember that to get through the day sometimes. If you need to, make lists. They really helped me see the pros and cons of having a child logically. I also have some kick ass friends who supported me through those feelings of guilt and the possibility of not being enough. Of slamming the door on a chapter of your life instead of gently closing that door with menopause. 

All that said, I wouldn‚Äôt trade my hyst for the world. It was literally the best thing I have ever done for myself. You will make it through this. I‚Äôm here if you want to talk."

k9sports,fah4bpv,t3_e8xdtk,1576078856.0,"USAR person here.  My team requires a four month probation before you can become a training member of the team.  You have to go out to at least 50% or the trainings and volunteer your time.  If you can commit to that, they will take you as a training member.  You have a limited time window to complete the K9's training before you can be fully rostered to the team.  Does the team you are looking at have a situation like that?  Something you can try before you commit with Baron?

Also, SAR is a calling.  From your hesitations, I would say that now isn't the best time to really commit to a SAR team.  Your PhD will require a great deal of your time.  You want to explore all of the dog world and compete for prizes (I know many USAR dogs who compete in disc, agility, etc in addition to searching), which would be limiting it you commit to SAR.  SAR is EXPENSIVE.  Don't worry so much about him not being purpose bred or being a little older - my team takes them as old as 2 years old to start training.

TLDR: I think SAR is something for you to explore further in the future.  If there is a volunteer option for your local team, do that to stay active with them.  Give yourself the time to finish your degree, explore the dog world with Baron, get on your feet financially, and see if you really want to pursue SAR when the time comes.

From what my docs say, diffuse adeno tends to have a rougher time getting the PSN to work.  If you have focal adeno the PSN has a higher success rate.  The only issue is that it's almost impossible to tell the difference without a hyst (and even then it's dicey).

As my pain increased I reached out to my specialists again.  We opted to go for the full shebang on surgery (I have mental health issues that led to the removal of my ovaries to control hormones).

Dogtraining,f47f88a,t3_djn592,1571421593.0,"Two toy game works well, tugging with two toys to develop an ""out"" command helps too.  Another thing I have used is treats.  I keep them on me and ask the dog to bring the ball to me for a quick treat then I toss it (short throws) and repeat."
ContestOfChampions,f471tin,t1_f471m35,1571416334.0,I hope that‚Äôs not the issue but I‚Äôll happily exchange the phone if it is. Sigh. Thanks for the info!
ptsd,f46ztam,t3_djo29f,1571415640.0,Definitely a form of abuse.  My ex-husband would do this to me no matter what reason I was in the bathroom.  He wanted to make sure I wasn't talking to other guys.  Definitely not ok in any situation.  Bathroom time is private time in my book.
ContestOfChampions,f46z0ct,t1_f45wpiq,1571415320.0,"Yep!  It's an iPhone.  Hasn't happened on any other apps, just MCOC and it's killing me!  I have a ticket into Kabam, but we shall see how long that takes."
ContestOfChampions,f449sji,t1_f448w35,1571349597.0,Already done. No dice
DMT,f3v48xs,t3_di6j1f,1571171417.0,I giggle.
adenomyosis,f3qx9i9,t3_dhq4rn,1571082225.0,I had mirena and had an increase in symptoms.  I can't do any progesterone (initially thought it was estrogen).  I had my mirena pulled after 6 months.  I have used marijuana for pain and have found edibles to be better for pain.  Smoking marijuana just made me care less about the pain.
adenomyosis,f3qs01m,t1_f3qrv5g,1571079828.0,So far I still can't log
adenomyosis,f3p8r4e,t3_dhldul,1571049932.0,I had the same. I also had diffuse adeno and was in pain at least 3 weeks out of each month.
ContestOfChampions,f3olhqq,t3_dhiakw,1571021136.0,I can‚Äôt even log into the game now. Keeps popping up that it can‚Äôt connect to the server and to try again. Two days of this.
Endo,f3kku14,t1_f3eztio,1570966775.0,I don‚Äôt take it orally. I take it vaginally. This helps prevent blood clots. Maybe your doc could look into it for you?
Endo,f3cgtyh,t1_f3b2jd0,1570823902.0,"I misread the title initially and thought you were going to get a hyst.  How are you doing post op?

I am great now!  I woke up from surgery in no pain and have continued with that.  I am able to do HRT with straight estrogen.  I finally feel like I am not on a hormonal emotional rollercoaster and there is no pain.  It's honestly been a bit much to wrap my head around, but I am getting used to it."
Endo,f3buvo7,t3_dg6kpv,1570816436.0,"My best friend was convinced she had endo.  I was convinced I did not.  Both of us had laps.  Her lap showed nothing, though they did test of IC, which she has.  I had stage 3 endo and adenomyosis.  You never know what they will find.  If you don't have endo at least you know and can start to find out what the symptoms may be from.  My friend has IC and Rheumatoid Arthritis - not endo - but the symptoms for her were similar to endo."
Endo,f39nb99,t3_dg4vs9,1570751864.0,"Adeno as well? 

I had my hyst in February. Total with bilateral oophorectomy (mental health concerns drove that decision). It was hands down the best thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself. I hope your new normal is blissful and pain-free üôÇ"
adenomyosis,f2wsjhs,t3_deks3w,1570469670.0,As in orally?  I have used THC oil orally with good results.  It really kinda makes you not care about the pain.
endometriosis,f2dktwp,t3_dczauh,1570156906.0,Yes. I had both. I had a few surgeries then had my hysterectomy. It gets better. If you want to join r/adenomyosis we‚Äôd love to have you.
