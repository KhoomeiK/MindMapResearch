Not gonna go in depth about how i feel about the story but I guess point is, besides the whole anti-revenge thing, is also that this abby person we're playing as really isn't that different from Ellie? Feel like that's what they were going for with the minigame where she's shooting arrows at targets. Similar to how Ellie did with the water guns. 

Like the point is how people can be nice and fun loving sometimes but also capable of brutality and that goes for both sides?"

Rather than judging yourself for your circumstance and the way you are, understand and accept who you are and why things have ended up this way. I promise itll get easier if you do this. Be kind to yourself.

Its perfectly normal to feel a sense of inadequacy if you're not getting any, but theres no need to feel this way. It's just nature and the sex drive fucking with your head, making you feel like shit because it wants you to have sex by any means possible.

Intimacy is a human need and a natural instinct but dont let it affect your sense of self worth. Theres more to life than that. Stay strong and dont stop searching"

i'm currently with a good therapist who has tried to help me remeber previous traumatic experiences in order to determine the source of my compulsions, as well as doing some soul searching and attempting to understand what makes me tick on my own part.

I'd love to know more about these ways of healing guilt you're talking about"
Guilt,fix6uvp,t1_fghw4c3,1582814068.0,"yeah i have considered that as well, I think this video by bill gates addresses that quite nicely:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obRG-2jurz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obRG-2jurz0)"
Guilt,fiwsaaz,t1_fiws2gn,1582800748.0,Yeah I do a daily meditation with Sam Harris' app. I have been doing so for over and year now and I genuinely do think it's made a big difference to my quality of life. It's not a cure-all of course but it does make it a lot easier to recognise certain thought patterns and stop them.
Guilt,fiws14c,t3_fa4trh,1582800385.0,"First of all, let's put this in perspective:

What have you done that's so terrible? Smoked some weed without your parent's knowledge? I realise it's difficult, but ask yourself, is that really so bad?

How many kids all over the world over the years do you think have done something behind their parent's backs in the name of feeling good or having fun? How many current parents do you think did the same thing in their teenage years? How many of your friends have done exactly what you've done? Do you consider all these people terrible monsters?  

The fact is, this incident with your parents has left you somewhat traumatised and the guilt you feel is your survival instincts way of assuring you don't piss your parents off again. Why are you so afraid of pissing your parents off? Well once again, it's your survival instincts at play. You rely on your parents for survival, or at the very least, a comfortable life. So this guilt you feel is not because you have done something genuinely terrible, but because you're afraid of a repeat of what happened last time. 

Understanding oneself and why one reacts in a certain way to certain things is key to overcoming these kinds of issues. Observe your reactions and understand without judgement. That last part is especially important. It needs to be without judgement as far as you can manage that. Even if the conclusion you come to is unflattering. 

Remember, you're only human. Be kind and compassionate towards yourself. 

In terms of what action you can take right this minute, I would recommend staying away from the weed if it's causing this kind of reaction. Search up some deep breathing exercises or meditations to temporarily help with your anxiety issues. And as others have said, self-care. Shower, cosy bed, low fi hip hop beats to chill to playlist etc.  :)

Good luck and take care."
Guilt,fiwrjzv,t1_fiwgo2g,1582799711.0,"Thank you. I am trying to do that through self-reflection and therapy. Guilt seems to be at the heart of OCD for many people. 

I think altruism is important because I think suffering matters. But like I said the conflict is still there because I don't know where to draw a justified line, and I realise I'll never find one my mind is happy with. But that doesn't stop it trying. 

You're absolutely right there is no one act that can eliminate this."

DeathStranding,f9pvq0w,t1_f9pvage,1575549920.0,"Possibly, but actually the walking aspects of the game were what intrigued me the most, as the challenge of walking from A to B seems to be one of the main mechanics of the game, such as figuring out how to get up a mountain safely, while the vehicles seemed to me to be the most boring looking part of it. 

I was getting bored travelling by vehicle from one outpost to another in MGSV, so I can't imagine that doing it for miles in Death Stranding is going to be much fun for me. But there is an audience for that kind of thing, hence why games like Euro Truck Simulator exist, which is why I think a demo would be such a good idea.

You could even create a demo mission which others a ""vertical slice"" of the game, a bitesize offering on what you can expect from the game as a whole. So let's say the demo mission is an hour-long, you could design the mission to offer half an hour of walking and half an hour of driving. Of course, there are also other elements like avoiding BT's and mule camps which you may want to squeeze in there as well."
