shrooms,fpmrhxq,t1_fpmqxvy,1588739812.0,Aight thanks I‚Äôll probs paper towel them up with no bag. Hopefully the smell won‚Äôt escape the paper towel ü§ûüèΩ
shrooms,fpmpvto,t1_fpmpblj,1588738656.0,Dam that‚Äôs a little tough. I‚Äôm trying to stay lowkey about them so hiding them is my only option
shrooms,fpmpo83,t1_fpmpex7,1588738505.0,that‚Äôs legendary
shrooms,fpmphy8,t1_fpmp699,1588738382.0,Alright thanks. I live with my parents so It would be so risky to put them in the fridge and letting them breath would probably risk me getting caught. My only option is to seal them away under my bed and hope they stay cool
shrooms,fp9iekk,t3_gc5cfo,1588426997.0,Love it man
shrooms,fp5s15a,t3_gbh3hd,1588338568.0,Look like a lightskin tiddie lmao
shrooms,fp5dmfr,t3_gbeqmf,1588325428.0,Shrooms just tripled this mans IQ
shrooms,fp58k3f,t1_fp511j7,1588320067.0,"I don‚Äôt have a scale that weights grams in my house so I couldn‚Äôt weight them but I took 3 pretty small wet subs. I only halucinated slightly at the peak and saw little things like squiggles/blurr in the corner of my eye and the posters in my room slightly jiggling around. Although the hallucinations weren‚Äôt the part that made it fun, just the free and relaxed feeling of pure joy and energy was what I enjoyed. I only noticed difference in my thought process slightly at a few points. I‚Äôd just realise things that I didn‚Äôt before. I was playing a game and the longer I played it the more I understood little hints and links in the lore that I wouldn‚Äôt have realised."
shrooms,fp50xjp,t3_gbcde2,1588312837.0,I was in the exact same position as u last week man. Did a small dose for the first time while my parents went to bed. Honestly wish I did more but atleast a got a feel for it for the first time.
shrooms,fp50mc0,t3_gbcgeb,1588312572.0,Damn you find this in your child‚Äôs room or something lmao?
shrooms,fp1io09,t3_gas1cf,1588236834.0,How long after some rain did you find these?
shrooms,fp19wbf,t1_fp19hcr,1588228677.0,"Yeah no worries, thanks man. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be eating these anyways"
shrooms,fp19630,t1_fp17a9z,1588228036.0,"I picked some and ate them in the exact spot that were subs/ everyone was telling me they were, looked the exact same, same stems. I‚Äôve also done a lil research online from them and the stems can vary."
shrooms,fp129u1,t1_fp11ryy,1588222471.0,"Yeah bruh, they look a lot worse in the photo than when I picked them tho that‚Äôs for sure"
shrooms,fp11v97,t1_fp11nog,1588222176.0,Thanks. so I‚Äôll try and get them dryed ish and analyse for any maggot and blue bruising. I‚Äôll most likely toss them though cause they look pretty gross
shrooms,fp117qr,t1_fp10fg0,1588221714.0,Ohh righto I see I picked them in the rain. So they were probs still wet from that. Should I dry them out a lil or just throw them in the trash?
shrooms,fp10d3a,t1_fp0w2cg,1588221124.0,Fr? I thought they were subs. Some have blue bruising but haven‚Äôt ID‚Äôd shit yet. Are you saying this cause they not subs or cause of the shape?
shrooms,fp0uk2o,t1_foz3r4b,1588217247.0,Usually about an hour and you‚Äôll notice a different possibly earlier
shrooms,foxr2tv,t1_foxoutn,1588153314.0,Wym by gauge?
shrooms,foxoqnh,t3_ga5yi0,1588150938.0,I‚Äôd say 2 thirds of the bar to get a better experience of what shrooms are like but for a first time I‚Äôd say maybe half now and then you have half another time? But since it didn‚Äôt have an effect on you last time then slam the whole bar
shrooms,foqjchn,t1_foqeyx1,1587994871.0,Your a genius this is the response I was looking for hopefully I can make this work. Thanks legend
shrooms,foq5pfy,t3_g8yaoj,1587983946.0,If his mood is good beforehand then he has a good chance to enjoy so surprise him right beforehand or during the come up I‚Äôd say. Make sure to take care of yourself too though :)
shrooms,fon7e5y,t1_fon6kzo,1587913846.0,Yeah pitch black area and reasonably cool. Nothing over around 20 degrees Celsius. Air drying would a little tough as I live with my parents and brother and don‚Äôt want to raise suspicion/ get caught out.
shrooms,folyzzi,t3_g87nen,1587873922.0,"You know the name,  just google if they are ¬ø"

shrooms,foj7qc8,t1_foj7gd8,1587811706.0,"Done, the new photo dosnt really differ that much."
shrooms,foj79e2,t1_foj5oxh,1587811177.0,I checked on them and I think the blue bruising has started to show more. If I knew how to send a pic without posting I would
shrooms,foj75ah,t1_foj5oxh,1587811050.0,makes a lot of sense
shrooms,foj5ih1,t1_foj56xf,1587809193.0,"Fair enough. This might be an extremely dumb questions but what if I ate a tiny pinch of one just to determine if it has any slight negative effects on my body, I‚Äôm talking like the smallest bit. I‚Äôm sure this is still an extremely dumb thing to do but I thought I might aswell ask cause why not ü§£ü§£"
shrooms,foj4vo9,t1_foixbpr,1587808473.0,aiight thankyou so no blue bruising = throwaway
shrooms,foiwqmp,t3_g7pbw6,1587799616.0,Thought about this too
shrooms,foiv88j,t1_foiuzmi,1587798135.0,"alright thanks , they do seem pretty a little old/ dry so I think they were starting to die when I picked them resulting in them not bruising well"
shrooms,fnz9bj5,t3_g4rqch,1587389267.0,Damm where do these grow?
shrooms,fnz3a5g,t3_g4n6lj,1587384835.0,How u going now man? You will be alright just know that your not in any danger

shrooms,fnvrwqx,t3_fztngc,1587303124.0,Defining these always confuses me
shrooms,fnsuqwx,t1_fnspbu9,1587229173.0,Also will I have to spore print every single sub I find and post them here in order to be 100%? Surely there‚Äôs a more convenient way :/
shrooms,fnsuehw,t1_fnspbu9,1587228986.0,Alright thanks. subs terrify me there‚Äôs such a fine like between having a good trip and death
Anxiety,fnsp513,t1_fnnz5ux,1587226109.0,"Wow that‚Äôs crazy, I‚Äôm the exact opposite and my anxiety completely disappears after about 9 at night. Although I wake up stressed and anxious. L-theanine has definitely helped although hard to notice any difference until about a week in when things just felt slightly easier. Since we are in isolation I‚Äôve stopped taking it although Ive noticed the increase in anxiety without it."
Anxiety,fjg335c,t3_fd7lez,1583309306.0,"I‚Äôm super proud of you Mikey, I‚Äôm 18 and don‚Äôt have autism but I struggle with the same problems.

Anxiety,fi3983b,t1_fi2zxd3,1582107252.0,"Damn thanks for your advice I‚Äôll definitely look into that next time. I just ordered some and im so relieved that my parents were chill with it. I went with nutricost, hopefully they are a good brand."
