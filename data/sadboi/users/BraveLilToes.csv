On a similar-ish note, and I've never told this to anybody until now, but sometimes I'm in so much pain that I fantasize about a loved one dying (nobody in particular at all, just any person very close to me) just so I can focus on myself and have an excuse to really think about my life and if I want to really continue it or not.

Celebrated my 26th birthday in the hospital and the nurses got me a cake :')

I got there on a Friday night, which sucked because my hospital doesn't run therapy groups on the weekend, so I had to wait a few days for some structured schedule where it was easy to talk to my peers and share our stories. Most of us on the unit were survivors of trauma, so none of us went into detail about our traumas as to not trigger anybody. We had art therapy, process group therapy, and trauma group therapy each day.

They check in on you every 15 minutes 24/7 and I was terrified to use the bathroom, which only had a curtain, because I didnt want then to walk in when I was using it lol so I learned to time my bathroom trips to start right after they did their 15 minute rounds. 

There are some weird patients that you'll meet, but you will make some great people there, too. After all, you're all at rock bottom together, so you bond crazy amounts as you're each individually trying to get help.

I'm a 26F loser here, and spent my 26th birthday inpatient. The best thing that happened to me in 2019 was me going to the hospital and getting help. For multiple reasons...
It completely changed my family life for the better. In high school, after a traumatic event that happened to my mom in our house, I asked my parents if I could go to therapy because it left me with worsening anxiety and depression, and my dad told me that I'm a perfectly normal teenager and if I needed therapy then every last teenager needs therapy, even though I had just seen my mom attempt and nearly succeed (brother did CPR) in ending her life weeks prior. He finally said that I can go, but also told me that if I dont tell him what happens during my therapy sessions then he isn't paying for it. ($50 a session) 
But anyways, finally, back in August I almost shot myself and was hospitalized for 36 days and was in intensive therapy for 4 months straight. While inpatient, the very first day, my dad changed his thinking. He started being super supportive of my mental health and has since been amazing towards me. I think the reality set in for him after he realized that he almost lost his youngest daughter. 

Have you been inpatient before? It's truly amazing. It puts life outside on a pause, and you can deal with your struggles with professionals. You'll meet some AMAZING people, both staff and patients. I still talk to a few fellow patients I met there, and even hung out with a few on the outside a couple times! It will feel amazing being cared about by your therapists and nurses and techs there. It will feel great being able to take the weight of suicide off your shoulders, because it's impossible in the hospital. You'll feel more like yourself in there and grow greatly. When you're in there, you can also opt for family sessions with your social worker, where your dad could be told by a professional that your mental illness is 100% real and valid. I know it sucks right now with your dad, but I'm really excited for you to go to the hospital because it really is lifechanging. It took 2 back to back admissions (from August to October, 36 days in total between 2 admissions and partial hospitalization program) for me to finally feel like my life is turning around. Nothing much in my life changed except for my thinking, and that's what has saved my life. And most days, I'm even glad I'm alive and I NEVER thought I'd be able to say that! 

Good luck in there :) I know it doesnt seem like it now but you're starting 2020 off on the right foot. Take care of yourself. Love you"

And I bought them! And they were 2 sizes too big and they felt like stiff clown shoes. The thing I hate more than buying things is RETURNING THINGS, and also I didn't want to waste my money that I didn't want to spend in the first place, so I wore the shoes when I needed to, and I got painful blisters, but sometimes it felt okay with a couple pairs of thicker socks.

*Canon HD DSLR Camera - I went into Best Buy to browse the camera selection, not intending to actually buy anything, but wanted to look around because that's what me and my friends used to do when we would hang out back in the day-- we would go window shopping inside stores. Well, this nice salesman came over and spent a lot of time telling me about the different cameras and then highly and repeatedly suggested that I buy this expensive camera, and so I finally caved and I spent every dollar I saved up on something I didn't want, regrettably barely even used it and sadly have since moved several times and don't know where it is now...

*MacBook Air - I went into the computer store actually intending on buying one, and this salesman was so funny and nice and he would make us laugh and we would make him laugh and he kept highly and repeatedly suggesting (as all salesmen do), so I finally bought it, even though I didn't want the Air because I wanted a CD drive and also a laptop that wasn't so fragile. I didn't like it, but I didn't want him to feel bad so I emptied my bank account.

*A BRAND NEW CAR - I went to a car dealership to buy a new car. You know how long those appointments are.... How intimidating salesmen are.... well, long story short, it is years later and I'm still paying off the car that I didn't even like when I bought it with my own money.

On a similar note, NEVER BE ""THAT GUY"" ON THE TRAIN THAT IS LISTENING TO MUSIC OR WATCHING LOUD VIDEOS FROM SNAPCHAT OR INSTAGRAM. Please, just use some headphones, and if you don't have any with you then I'm pretty sure you can wait until you get off of a crowded train to play all those snapchat videos of your sl***y drunk friends singing and twerking in a crowded bar or club, with music so loud in the background that the microphone loudly muffles the entire video."

I would be at school, like 2nd-5th grade or whatever idk, and there was this intruder who came in to kill everybody except for the 6th graders. The intruder was a reaaaaally skinny guy, like really bony, and he was bald and had an adult diaper on, and didnt even have any shoes. The 6th graders lined up behind him as he marched into each classroom and killed each student just by pointing at them and making a whining noise and they would just drop dead. He came into my class each time but I hid in one of those agility tubes that they have at dog parks."

I wasnt feeling well and I farted and instantly knew I shit myself and I was scared because he would obviously smell it in the car, so I walked home instead. My creepy uncle lived down south and was just visiting and didn't know the area, so he got lost and it took him like an hour to find his way back even tho it shouldve taken him 5 mins. When I got home, I took my nasty panties off and hid them in my bedroom closet. My dad got home from work and walked by my bedroom and smelled it from the hallway, so when he went to the bathroom I put my underwear in a plastic bag and tied it and threw them away somewhere. 

I'm a girl btw so idk, it just made it worse since I wanted the whole world to think that girls didn't poop, let alone shit their pants."

We work at a pediatric psych hospital and he whispers horrible things to our patients while they're in a crisis. The child will be completely vulnerable while in a restraint due to severely aggressive or unsafe behaviors, and this asshole whispers things in their ears like ""I f***** your mom."" Over and over. And tells them ""wait till I catch you off camera, I'm gonna f*** you up"". 

I've reported him several times, but unfortunately it's my word against his. The best thing I can do during situations like these, is to wipe the kid's tears away and kind of ""pet"" them, in a comforting way, and tell them that they're safe and that they're loved.

BE PATIENT WITH THEM!!! Don't speak slowly to them or louder and slower like they're deaf or stupid. They're far from stupid. Give them time to take in the information. 

Never yell at them. Most people with autism have hypersensitive hearing and it might make them uncomfortable and therefore agitated. Also, in general, don't yell at anybody. If somebody doesnt respect you without yelling, they definitely wont respect you while yelling. 

Also, I wish the word ""autistic"" didn't exist because it makes it seem like THAT defines the person, whereas it should be said ""(person) with Autism"", since that is one of the experiences that the person may go thru. (Like how the OP said it! Good job OP) üòä"
