ect,fmm39q8,t3_fvvjnn,1586197977.0,I went through 15 rounds of unilateral last winter/spring. I felt a lot of the ways you feel. I expected the memory impairments but I was really bothered by the cognitive impairments. I had enjoyed writing poetry but like you I guess I had trouble with word retrieval. I could barely write a simile. I’m pleased to report that that has gotten better a year out. I think ECT just severs many of the interconnecting pathways in our brain and it takes some time to rebuild those pathways. I’m back to writing poetry though :)
bipolar,fmlo0ud,t1_fmlkhnr,1586190058.0,"Thank you so much for your response! I really appreciate all the info and the links. Thinking of my brain rewiring itself is an oddly hopeful concept. I have definitely thought of this major episode as a really traumatic experience but I wasn’t sure it properly could be called one. It explains a lot—I don’t feel like it’s in the past, I feel like it’s looming over me all the time. I think therapy is a really solid suggestion."
bipolar,fmlnem0,t1_fmlkus5,1586189751.0,"Thank you so much for your response. It sounds silly but having you say you’re pulling for me made me shed a tear. It’s really nice to get support from people who understand (that said, all support is really heartwarming). Establishing routine and taking baby steps is a good suggestion. I’m working on that—taking my meds at the same time everyday, eating healthy and at regular intervals, etc. Still working on sleep and sadly with this pandemic exercise is kind of tough but I think I’ll try some yoga. I’m looking into a therapist but I’m very intimidated by sharing all my feelings right now, though I think that means I need it."

depression,evnbvqn,t1_evnas2u,1564622233.0,You could always just have mixed episodes instead. Something to consider. Bipolar 2 and MDD and are often mistaken for each other.
depression,evnab2u,t1_evn9j65,1564621436.0,There are two types of bipolar disorder: 1 and 2. The difference primarily is that type 1 experiences full blown mania and type 2 experiences hypomania.
