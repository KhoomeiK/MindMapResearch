- What was the inspiration and/or reasons behind ‘Ketamine’? It’s one of my absolute favorites. 

You have such a beautiful voice and it gives me chills every time I hear it. I’ve never had a voice effect me so greatly on a physiological level. Thank you so much for sharing it with us. I adore you. 

- Any thoughts on recording some covers? (Bowie and Blondie would be incredible). 

- Can you please record a cover of ‘Creep’ by Radiohead for me? Pretty please with a cherry on top? I need more of your voice! 

Stay safe and wonderful, xo."
