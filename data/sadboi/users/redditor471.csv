I don't care if people will consider me a pussy for running, I'd rather people think I am a pussy than be possibly stabbed, shot or hit with some other weapon, or just be really hurt. If you can not in any way turn or hide, fight. Really be dirty when you fight. You know those rules of fighting you know? Abandon them. Don't play fair, don't be even, do everything you can to absolutely obliterate their sorry butt. Except hitting the guy's nuts. If you have a chain, whip them with it, punch them with it, whatever. If you have a rock, threaten to hit them with it. If they don't want to stop fighting, hit them with it. Other than that, push them, kick them, shove them, punch them, tackle them, knee them, whatever. Everything. That is my guide. The end."
