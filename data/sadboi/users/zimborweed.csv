Not being loved is rough. It hurts to see the things others have and feel like you are pathetic in how you long for it and no matter what you try, you just can't match up

I have friends though (just a few) I've made friends who betrayed me, and I've been cast out of communities at least 4 times now for just being weird (ostracized)"

* Confidence - Telegraphs status
* Height - Telegraphs Status
* Job/Wealth - Associated with status
* Race/caste - Associated with Status

In the end women attracted to **status**. I suppose men can want that too, but they aren't seeking that on a default. Most guys want someone loyal, honest and they can relate to but will never have it (and yes, hot... but women want a hot guy as well, duh). But women want something more than they are and amount to, and they will always get it. That's normal. Men? That's not normal and we call that being a cad, or a parasite. But if you call a woman that then that's 'hateful' 

For the woman, it's not about love or even a fun time, it's about being with someone and part of something that makes you feel less inferior.\*

That's also an error. You are always going to be inferior taking this route if that's how you look at men and pick them out."

Take pride in the times you can see that yourself. It makes you stronger and odds are if you are feeling particularly lousy you feel that way because you know people connected to you who have it better and are softer. That doesn't make them better. It just makes you feel worse.  


It's the times I get lost, and really confused. and frustrated why things don't just work out that I lose sight of things and doubt myself. Sometimes therapy can help with that but I find it really irelevant. Real solution towards real problems: Not experiencing sexual fulfillment or developing in a normal way because of it, not being loved, being abused on a day to day basis by others, being judged for shit you didn't do or treated like criminally minded neer-do-well, being betrayed by friends or those you trust, Feeling stuck at a job you don't want or living with parents who give you grief, Some days the list never ends and it becomes too much, and I don't have an answer beyond reach for whatever cope you must to make it through another day."

No, not really. People are indifferent to stuff beyond their own little world.

Everything is predatory. To act otherwise is just ignorant.

You basically have to keep her on a dark triad leash to make sure she knows her place. Otherwise they are gonna monkey branch.

Most men can drop a woman and take on a new one. In my mind i'm like a 1/10 for men. I can't compete with a bio woman. But digging deeper into it, most sexual attraction and interaction is similar. It spins around the idea and the circumstances surrounding it, rather than the release itself.

&#x200B;

Being a sissy is, however a more laborious task that I first realized. And that is something true whether you are hetero or not. Going trans is something I was wanting to do but I didnt want to do it alone. I also thought more about things like this and it made me second guess myself.  


I could play with cocks and enjoy being 'in the role' as a bitch as a bottom as a sissy. but what abotu something more than that? It's hard to imagine."
