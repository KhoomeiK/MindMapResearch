SuicideWatch,fnc45dq,t3_g0o0yj,1586828227.0,Well I hate my life rn as well.Im a 19 year old Male who just broke up with his girlfriend last week. For the past month iv wanted to die. Someone died last night and I wish it was me instead.  I feel selfish to everyone who cares about me but these last 6 weeks have been the worst in my life. My job laid me off. My ex girlfriend doesn't even give a shit about the breakup so I'm left here asking why does god take those who love life instead of me. Everyone else is happy except for me
