depression,ewwshxh,t3_cn5vlj,1565834242.0,So I'm 26 an I have so many things around me daily that should make me feel happy . I've just been accepted into college and yet I can't seem to find my way back to the happiness I once had . I wake up every morning an I'm either angry or just feeling bad for my self as if I've done something wrong . yet my day has just started . I've never been one for meds but at this point I'm lost it feels like I'm drowning constantly like no matter what I can't make it back to the surface to catch my breath . should I try the meds ? I'm scared to admit my problems to those I love cause I don't want to be judged as crazy or unapprochable . what can I do to beat this ?
