heroin,fqa69gs,t3_ghpym8,1589213567.0,"I'm a very casual H user, I only ever snort the stuff, and once a week max (usually a lot less than this as I do not always buy it!)

I initially tried it to see what the 'hype' was about, come to find there isn't really one - but this is the downfall. Thinking that H is 'less' than was depicted, wondering how people get addicted so quickly when you haven't is problematic.

*""Its not happened to me, so I can take more and take it more often, right?""*  \- wrong. When this mindset manifests it can become very dangerous and a slippery slope.. 

My advice to you is try to moderate your usage, maybe set vague limits - such as once a week or once every 2 weeks? But sometimes go longer? Use it as an occasional treat? 

My mentality is, I really do like the stuff, but that is what scares me. If I feel I've worked really hard all week or I realise its been a while since I've had some, I'll make a nice evening out of sniffing some H. 

Try not to sniff through the 2 grams in less than 2 months (\~0.25g per use across 8 weeks), and try to limit usage to once a week to ease tolerance build up. If you can make it last longer thats great! Stay safe."
IBO,fpwb8yc,t3_gfo87k,1588960417.0,"As others have advised, take a couple moments and breathe. 

IB is tough, so try not to be so hard on yourself. Remind yourself that this is not the be all and end all, just because you are currently at a 22, does not mean you will be at the end of your second year. 

You seem to have a willingness to achieve a higher score and go to university - let this be your motivation. Take some time and think about subjects that you find easier than others, try and bring those grades up. For instance, I always found physics very difficult but I found subjects like business management and english easier - I focused on achieving at least a 3 or 4 on physics, but pushing my english and business grades up to at least a 6. 

It is more than achievable to bring things up in your second year. My brother was in a similar situation to you at the end of his 1st year - predicted a 21. He used this 'shock factor', as motivation I guess - worked really hard in the 2nd year and managed to bring his marks up to a 35. In terms of university applications, yes it made it very difficult; but there is always clearing or adjustment. 

You can apply to universities that will accept your current grades and use those to fall back on if things do not look up. But if you work hard and bring your grades up, you will be able to apply to other universities and courses through clearing. This might even give you some more time to really think about what you want to do at university, or as a career. Bare in mind that what you do at university does not dictate your future job or career. 

This is not the be all and end all, you got this."

I feel weird wearing lingerie, 'sexy' underwear, sex toys and masturbation. I'm just not into it, it makes me feel so uncomfortable, I just don't feel like a sexual person or 'being' at all.

I love chilling, watching Netflix, playing sims, doing small crafts around the house. 

I have no desire to be a CEO or head of a company, I don't want the responsibility. Imagine being a managing director and having to deal with this outbreak?! No thanks. I want to be an employee, do my job and go home to my sanctuary.

Increasingly, I'm feeling an unsaid pressure from family and significant other to 'better' myself and do productive things - ""if you aren't growing, you are shrinking"" .. or something like that. It makes me feel shitty for being the way I am.

BPD,fo8apwy,t3_g60xws,1587592992.0,"I resonate with this so much!!

I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm lazy through and through, I do make an effort to exercise (ordinarily I'll go to the gym twice a week and do a couple home workouts), however my interests include Netflix, the sims and general chilling. 

I like to be at home and relax, it makes me happy. However my partner, much like yours, is a doer. I'm happy for him, he has all of this energy and motivation to 'do things', but I hate feeling like he looks down on me for my habits. 

I'm not going to be one to change for someone else, but for myself, I do actively want to find more hobbies to add to my 'repertoire', if you will. I am a home gal (well everyone is now lol), so I've been looking into creative things I can do from the comfort of home that makes me feel a little less lazy. I've ordered painting by numbers, scooby dos, and I've downloaded Pixelmator to try my hand and digital image creation. 

To answer your question on 'how to get a lust for life', I don't think there is a straight up answer. Its cliche, but I think the 'lust' has to come from within. For me, I wanted to find a new hobby as netflix and the sims is getting a bit dry and boring. I've not 'channelled' my creative side for a while, so I figured now might be the best time to do so. Maybe there is a part of you that wants to find a new hobby? xx"
BPD,fo7z4mz,t3_g61u5j,1587587045.0,"I never considered this to be even remotely true, until recently. 

I've always felt comfortable in relationships. Being with someone fills my need for external validation and I like having someone to talk to, cuddle and just do nice things with in general. 

However recently, I have come to realise that being in a relationship can be such a time suck. As you mention, when in a relationship you are often putting so much time, effort and energy into someone else, that sometimes you forgot about yourself. I'm seeing someone right now, but I cannot help but think that I would be in a better place in terms of my job, my fitness regime, my eating habits and my finances if I were single. 

I don't feel like I am ready for a relationship, I'm newly diagnosed and still need to learn coping mechanisms for triggers (which are largely, if not entirely, due to anxiety of partners leaving me or general arguments). I don't think I treat myself well enough, and if I don't have that baseline self-care and ability to treat myself right - how am I supposed to treat someone else right? 

All things considered, as someone else mentioned, the joy and comfort that stems from being in a relationship is lovely. I like the routine, I like the support, I like the stability. And being completely honest, its really nice having company during times like these. 

I'm going to 'ride the wave' of this current relationship, but when it does end, I will not rush into another until I am comfortable and self-assured that I am ready."

sex,fnae7fy,t1_fna4z7z,1586795945.0,"Thank you for sharing! Whilst I am in the complete opposite situation than you, I do understand the frustration. If the roles were reversed, I would be left feeling unsatisfied and insecure - like there was some reason why my partner doesnt want to be intimate with me. And just general sexual frustration isn't nice!! 

From your partners perspective, I can only share my own feelings. I've never been a hyper-sexual person, I experience periods of high libido for sure, but usually its rather low. Its frustrating for me, because I feel like there is something physiologically wrong with me - why don't I feel the urge to fuck like mad all the time? I worry that this issue I have with myself is something that would be a turn off for others when it comes to future relationships. 

I'm sure this issue is something your partner is conscious of and worried about. I'm sure they do want to pleasure you, but it is hard to perform your best when you just are not in the mood but are trying to make it seem like you are (no one wants their partner thinking they are just doing it to make the other happy). I've been in situations where I've engaged in sexual activity when I didn't want to and it does take a toll on mental health. 

Its tricky to come up with a simple solution for a complex problem, I think venting out on these communities is great, but stewing is not! Try and communicate more, if you don't already. And try to think of potential solutions. 

Solutions myself and my partner have discussed include him 'sorting himself out', me trying to get in the mood more often (sometimes it is a mental thing that you need to turn on and off?), engaging in more of a 'build up' (kissing, foreplay.. etc - anything to make me **feel** that sex is not the end goal)."
sex,fnacbao,t1_fna2lkz,1586794983.0,"Thank you for your input and for sharing your experiences. It does sound like you are trying your hardest to invest in your sex life, and I know it can feel shitty when it seems that you are the one putting in all the effort and it not being reciprocated. 

I am not your wife, but I feel I relate to a lot of what you've said about her and I can try and empathise. I'm sure she appreciates your efforts, but might not realise you are trying as hard as you are - maybe communicate this to her, if you haven't already? (that you really are trying, but don't feel like she is?) Or perhaps, as you mentioned earlier, your sex drives just are not compatible and she tries to make up for it in different ways? 

It's never nice being left to feel shitty and insecure about yourself, and I'm so sorry to hear you feel this way. It sounds like you have so much to give, that you really care for her and are trying your hardest to make things work. 

I can relate to what you've said, with my current partner. I know he tries, I know he invests time and effort into our relationship and goes an extra mile to make me feel secure, but I often fall up short when it comes to reciprocating. Often I don't realise what I am doing, so I appreciate it when he tells me and puts me in my place - why should you settle for much less than what you are giving? I try and change, but as you say, things level out and we are ultimately back at square one. I know that this is my fault, and something needs to change on my end - and I really am working on it. 

What I'm trying to say is that, maybe your wife doesn't realise how much you do invest in your relationship. Maybe she could benefit from some communication and you expressing to her how she makes you feel. Sometimes, we need a reality check.  

All in all, thank you for sharing, you've helped me understand some things about my relationship and how I can improve. And I hope you can find some clarity in what I have said, or at the very least, feel a sense of 'release' from sharing and typing out your situation."

BPD,fn9mx4o,t3_g0gsmu,1586778834.0,"Everyone is going to tell you that its going to be hard being friends with an ex - how can you be sure you don't feel anything for them? how can you be sure they are over you? how can you be sure that neither party get hurt? how can you be sure that feelings do not come up again? If it does work, then great, brilliant.

In your case, I think the fact that you dated for 2 years might be an issue. 2 years is a long time to have been romantically involved with someone, and feelings as such do not just go away over 6 months of not speaking (or maybe it does?). I have a close friend who was an ex, we were friends before, dated for 3 months, didn't speak for a month then slowly introduced each other back into each others lives. I feel if you do it slowly, and set boundaries it can work very well because you have that care for each other. 

The issue now, is that your feelings of him being your favourite person are returning - forgive me, but I do not feel this is healthy for you. I understand you want him in your life, but if he now considers you as merely a friend, and says things like 'I dont miss my friends but I miss my girlfriend' which hurt you, really think about how you feel and what you want. 

These FP feelings, whilst they might not be romantic now, could potentially develop into romantic ones? But irrespective of that, having an FP as someone who was an ex who is now with someone else is going to be really difficult, and might not be worth the heartache for yourself. 

Point blank: think about yourself - how is the current situation making you feel? If it is making you feel negative emotions, then try to change the situation. By all means keep him in your life, but try to set boundaries to keep your FP emotions at bay. Try to reach out to other friends, relatives.. etc for support as opposed to your ex-boyfriend. 

I hope this helps even a smidge, I know its hard, but just keep yourself safe and try not to get yourself hurt x"

On the other hand, it seems it is a big deal, and it is a 'fragile' topic of conversation for us. I understand its not something I can 'flip a switch' and just change - I feel maybe doing some research, speaking to a doctor about things I can do to increase libido could help."

It's hard to deal with, because you feel you've met 'the one' and you want to be with them and  make them happy (or maybe you just get addicted to talking to someone?) but remind yourself that you or the other person has ended it for a reason - ultimately, both parties would be better off without the other (remind yourself, you are better off without her). 

In every situation, it just takes time. A couple days, try to get your mind off of things - talk to someone new? watch a new tv show?

However in your situation, remind yourself that you were looking for something more than she was. You could have either lied to her (and yourself) saying that you didn't want a relationship and happy just being friends and being physical - but how long could that go on for? I think you did the right thing in being honest with yourself and her, you want more and **she cannot give you that**. Try to bare in mind that she is not right for you, not right now at least.

dexcom,fn6izgb,t3_fzrv45,1586700512.0,"I have had the Dexcom for 4.5 years now, and I absolutely love it. Its improved my quality of life so much, I'm sorry to hear it hasn't done the same for your husband. 

&#x200B;

1) Try placing it on the **abdomen** instead? This way you won't be worried about snagging on clothing.. etc (and if it does come off, contact Dexcom support and they send you a free replacement and might throw in stickers to help adhesion - the **customer service** is excellent!) 

2) Again, perhaps change the location where you place it? Again, I would recommend the abdomen - unless your husband sleeps on his stomach too.. 

3) **You can turn the alarms off**! I know this is a key function of a CGM, but there are some alarms that you just do not need. 

For instance, I've turned off my 'high glucose alert' because I get small banner notifications anyway! I would never do the same for low blood glucose, for obvious reasons! Yes it is such an obnoxious sound, but when you're seriously hypoglycaemic and in a deep sleep at 3 am, what else will wake you up? (And you can adjust the range at which it alerts you of a high or low!) 

4) You cannot manually test on the  Dexcom (it self-calibrates!! which I find amazing and so convenient) You can test on a separate Glucometer and input the reading to calibrate the system.  

&#x200B;

**Other positives:** (note: I have never had the Libre, so I am unsure if some of these features can be had with the Libre as well)

* tells you your reading every 5 minutes (no scanning, button pressing.. etc required) 
* provides indication of what direction your sugars are going in - rapidly increasing? decreasing slightly? 
   * (this really helps decide what to do in that moment - how much insulin and how quick? How desperately do you need sugar?) 
* people can 'follow' your readings via the 'Dexcom share' application. 
   * For instance, my mother lives halfway across the world from me but she can see my readings and she gets alerts herself (worries her sometimes, but she would rather know). 
   * Your doctor could download the app, see the readings and be able to formulate more suitable advice accordingly 
* the Dexcom 'clarity' application. This application, just wow. 
   * It 'banks' your Dexcom data for up to 90 and gives you full on REPORTS on your blood glucose. Your average sugars (i.e hbA1c), your best day (in terms of blood glucose), your personal blood glucose 'patterns' (e.g daytime highs, nighttime lows)
   * You can share these reports with your doctors so they can advise accordingly 
* if you have an apple watch, you can get the dexcom app on there too! So no need to take your phone out everytime you want to know how your sugars are

I would definitely recommend Jesmond in terms of atmosphere, proximity to the city centre and safety.

It is a popular location for students, which might be unsettling considering your family, however there are some areas and roads that are not-studenty. Such as Reid Park Road, Grosvenor Avenue (roads close to Jesmond Dene).

In my opinion, students aren't usually as bad as depicted. Sure, there will be house parties and some late nights, but if you ask students to keep the noise down, the decent ones will.

Jesmond is a lively area - bars, shops, restaurants and the park (Jesmond Dene), is lovely too.

Alternatively, Gosforth could be a good choice too. It is less studenty, not as many house parties for sure. It's still close to the city centre - maybe a 30 minute walk, or a 15 minute metro (if you live near Ilford Road or South Gosforth station).

I have walked all over Jesmond and Gosforth (to my knowledge these are the more affluent areas). at all times of day and night and have never had any trouble as a 21 year old female.

In terms of rent, of course it was cheaper for me as I was a student; I never paid more than 450 pcm including bills. Living costs are relatively low compared to other areas nationwide. For myself, I was able to live on around 900 GBP pcm including rent, bills and living costs (bare in mind I did go out a lot!!).

I hope this helps, and feel free to drop me a message if you have any queries regarding popular student roads in Jesmond/West Jesmond."

Drugs,eyrn1r6,t3_cy8t3d,1567372880.0,"around 2 years ago, i was taking mdma more or less every weekend for about 4 months. 

at first, i didnt feel much in terms of ramifications, id just need to take a little more each time.

but slowly, the 'magic' started to fade. i didnt feel the intense rush of euphoria. i wasnt really chatty and i wasnt affectionate anymore. 

when this started to happen is when i decided to take a break. 

for time scale reference, i was taking the drug weekly from mid november to mid march, which is when i decided to take a break.

i didnt feel any ramifications until that summer (july-august specifically). i began to feel quite down and depressed almost. i wasnt 'thinking' the same positive way i used to and things i once enjoyed didnt really interest me anymore. this 'slump' did go away, but of course i did stop taking mdma. 

mdma has never felt the same for me. i now get anxious and i just dont really have a good time, and my comedowns are horrible. 

in general now, my brain feels 'frazzled', i feel anxious - especially in social situations (which i never ever used to) and i am very sceptical of most things. 

however this has just been me, i know people who have taken more than me for a longer period of time and who are still going and are fine (seemingly). 

tl;dr - yeah, it can f\*\*k with you. it made me more anxious and i believe it sent me into a small period of 'depression' (?). to this day i am more anxious and sceptical and i do actually put it down to drug use (as a whole)."
Cutters,eypahem,t1_eyp9dx1,1567294584.0,"I think it would be good to identify urges, so you can be prepared (?) for me it was always anger, frustration and feelings of ‘inadequacy’ (if that makes sense lol) and from that I can realise what the triggering events may be and try avoid them. 

Regarding therapy, I think that’s a good thing to get into! It would be great to have someone to vent to who can be completely objective :) depending on where you are this can be easy or difficult to do without your dad knowing - if you’re in the UK, I’m sure you can just go to your GP and tell them of your troubles.. they could refer you to someone and your father wouldn’t necessarily need to know. 

Alternatively, you could be honest with him and just say that you are struggling mentally and would benefit from professional help. He might respect your wish to be discretionary or he might want more information. Either way, your father could be a good support system too... it will be hard to open up at first but having your dad to talk to who (as well as a potential therapist) would be great for you.

Best of luck xx"
Cutters,eyoz8dv,t3_cxnzgb,1567286057.0,"first of all, i'm heartbroken to hear about your situation :( i hope you're okay. 

second of all, I understand the want, urge and the 'need' to cut, i do - its a relief, release and expression of emotions. 

but it's pointless for me to say ""don't cut"", but I want to ask you to try and identify the thoughts and feelings that you experience prior to the urges to cut. what are the triggering emotions? what are the triggering events for these emotions? 

i think if you try and figure out what causes the urges, you might understand your own situation more. and when you identify the events and triggers, you can try think of and research coping mechanisms? things to take your mind away. 

i think researching coping mechanisms anywho would help, if you dont want to think about the triggers just yet. things to occupy your mind and time with.

as someone whos been there (literally exactly your position when i was 14), things DO get better - as the cliché saying goes ""this too shall pass""

Drugs,exmfixf,t3_au89r0,1566430646.0,"the other week, i took 600mg of pregabalin. its great! you feel floaty and chatty - it love it. 

around an hour later, i had a beer. it added a nice buzz; i felt good! but then i kind of felt the pregabalin waring off.. 

another hour later, i had another beer and then i got super super tired. like couldnt keep my eyes open.. etc 

i probs wouldnt mix pre and alcohol when going out clubbing etc. id like to take it when chilling, in a relaxed environment."
Drugs,ex3f2de,t1_ewybem4,1565984549.0,"Thank you for your advice!

I love the relaxing effect and the slight similarities to MDMA. 

But i dont want to be falling asleep during the festival.. how does drinking mix with it? (I do intend to be drunk lol)"
Drugs,ewy9zzm,t1_ewy9r61,1565877445.0,"Thanks! I probably won’t be taking stimulants - they don’t mix well with me anymore and I don’t like comedowns 😂 I think Redbull is as mix of a stimulant as I’d go for right now! 

But also, last time I took pregabalin, I took 600mg and it was great. But then I got very very very tired around 8 hours later (and it wasn’t even that late). Is this normal? Also, what dose would you recommend?"

afinil,ewpit79,t3_cpakx3,1565642106.0,"I started taking modafinil around March, whilst I was completing my dissertation for university. I didn't take it everyday at first, but started to as the weeks progressed. I began taking it every day to revise (I was doing 8-12 hour days); this continued for around 2 months.

&#x200B;

Sure, taking it gave me energy to get up and to remain focused for extended periods of time, I doubt I could have done such hours if I hadn't taken it. I wasn't feeling any negatives at first - I still had an appetite, could still sleep at night and I wasnt anxious or jittery. 

However, as time passed, I developed side effects. I lost my appetite and I started to feel anxious. My heart would be very fast and loud in my ears. I wasn't able to sleep at night even 12-16 hours after dosing. I began getting jittery, my hands would shake and I couldnt sit still or relax. When I would run into others in the library, I felt as if my mind was frazzled. I couldn't follow a conversation properly and I'd find I would say the wrong thing - I began getting socially anxious and not wanting to speak to people. SO many negatives - but how could i stop? It was this, seemingly minor issues, or my degree. 

&#x200B;

I starting taking propanolol (beta blocker) for the anxiety and jitteriness. I started taking diazepman and melatonin at night to be able to sleep. I was LIVING on sugar -  chocolate bars and sugary drinks. I could sleep, not get hunger pangs, and not be jittery and THAT anxious. But the mind frazzle and social issues were there. 

&#x200B;

Its been about 9 weeks since I've last touched the stuff, and I still feel anxious and not totally 'right'. But maybe that was due to my early 'not very reputable sources', or maybe thats just me and the way my body has reacted to the stuff.. I will never know. This is just my personal experience. 

&#x200B;

(I never took more than 200mg per day, usually in halves)

&#x200B;

Tl;dr - took it everyday for about 3 months. I felt anxious, jittery and socially awkward (i am NOT an awkward person). I had no appetite and had trouble sleeping. After stopping taking it the side effects went away or subsided. I still feel a little brain 'frazzled' and socially anxious/awkward."
opiates,ewphi7z,t3_cpg1me,1565641298.0,"painkillers are anti-inflammatory. they inhibit cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes which ultimately lead to the production of prostaglandins (PGs). Prostaglandis are pro-inflammatory and cause more inflammation and more pain. when you take aspirin, for exmaple, the activity of cyclo-oxygenases is inhibited, and prostaglandins cannot be produced. 

aspirin = no COX activity = no PGs = no more inflammation, no more pain.

(at least that what I learned in my degree, someone correct me if im wrong!!)"

Drugs,et7qbdp,t1_et63i4f,1562535886.0,"I still drink alcohol on occasion, like when I go out and sometimes socially. But I don’t go out much anymore and I decide to not drink with dinner more often than not.

&#x200B;

Bars and pubs are generally safe - as a 21/F; I've always felt safe in town, bars, clubs.. etc 

&#x200B;

there are loads of societies and activities that the student union has to offer, there is bound to be something you're into!!

&#x200B;

as for walking around with a camera; it should be fine.. people take pictures and you gotta do what you gotta do! just keep it secure on you and don't go to seemingly 'dodgy' places in the dark (parks, alleys.. etc)

&#x200B;

there are so many worthy places for photos!! the quayside is gorgeous, leazes park, jesmond dene (during daylight hours), architecture in town and even some roads in jesmond!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bowsden Court, Castle Leazes, Liberty Plaza, Park View Student Village, The View, Turner Court and Windsor Terrace (all of them self-catered, ensuite.) Any suggestions? I'm not very used to parties...also, I don't know if parties are more intense in the UK :p

as for accomodation; I would advise against Bowsden court as it is not near the city centre and you will need to get the metro everyday, and a friend of mine was placed in a flat with post graduates (not ideal). 

&#x200B;

I LOVE liberty plaza - deffo best bet! there are 3 blocks, a great common room, courtyard -  perfect location and sociable!! the view is a close second although there is no common room/outdoor area... etc

&#x200B;

castle leazes.. eh - i've heard mixed things. it is the oldest one, i have heard its very sociable but that its also quite druggy, and full of people who are friends from high school.. etc. 

&#x200B;

I dont know much about turner court, windsor terrace or park view.

general tips: its a great city! very easy to get around and cheaper than other cities. you will meet people - join the photography society; im sure there is one!!!"
