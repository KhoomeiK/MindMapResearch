And I truly hope you'll enjoy Ultraviolence. It is my number one album. Would love to hear your thoughts afterwards!"
vinyl,fpqz1l3,t1_fppac67,1588836697.0,"Yes, that's a Pro-Ject.

On my list are (not in order):

\- Suspiria (Remake) Soundtrack

\- If possible get at least one with The Last of Us Soundtrack

\- If You Leave by Daughter

\- All The Neighbourhood ones

\- All Lana Del Rey ones

\- Dogviolet by Laurel

\- Electraheart by Marina

\- Melodrama by Lorde

&#x200B;

Just a few of the many I have on my mind as of now. Would love to hear some recommendations if you have any? I strongly recommend these, especially Ultraviolence by Lana Del Rey, if you are interested. :)"

I've thought that it might not be too benefitial to have it on the same surface as the turntable. The vibration thing makes absolutely sense. Anyway, I'll try a few things out. :)

vinyl,fpniala,t3_gei3ix,1588763815.0,"I've always dreamt of having my own record player, and been saving up the past few months to finally buy it this week. My boyfriend helped me a lot to select the parts I need and recommended me everything, since I'm not really a techy person.

Basically, I wanted a decent set up for an okayish price. It didn't have to be ""too much"" nor a crosley record player. I'm honestly really really happy with my set up and it's everything I've wanted but I'd love to upgrade some parts someday, not anyone soon though. It looks beautiful and sounds beautiful. What more could I ask for?

I'm also so so so excited to enlarge my collection, since as of now I only have three albums (all three from Lana Del Rey, If I may add.)

Next on my list are the suspiria one, one from the neighbourhood & probably one from lorde and daughter.

I don't mind album recommendations! Very welcome actually!"
