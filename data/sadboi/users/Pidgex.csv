ForeverAlone,fma3u5p,t3_ftty6m,1585883138.0,"Yeah it’s tough man, I usually seclude myself from a group when I’m feeling useless to see if anybody cares enough to hit me up, but it never happens. It usually ends with me feeling lonely and awkwardly coming back to see if anybody cared enough about me to notice I was gone for a bit (like a week or two) but it never happens.

I also feel like talking about my problems is just bugging people which could turn into them being annoyed by me. I usually drink my problems away and on occasion have a drunk breakdown with friends that have it far better than me about how I’m a useless piece of crap because nobody cares about me. Might not be the best advice to take to heart though.

Although it’s been getting better lately and people are actually starting to enjoy my company more, so there is at least a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. Doesn’t mean they help me with my mental state, but hey it’s at least something. Most people will only try to help you if they’re confronted with it, because they don’t want to say ‘I don’t care’ straight to your face, since it makes them feel like assholes too. But once that is over, they will just go on and not think of you. However, there really are some nice people in the world that try and help people because they feel like that is the right thing to do. But those are few and far between."

depression,fkqhyti,t1_fknt6r6,1584446466.0,"It’s nice of you to say that, but I don’t think it’ll get better that quickly. What I do know is that I’ve learned that people won’t try to act like they care in a situation where they don’t care. They will only try to mediate a situation if they’re confronted with it. And if the friend you care so deeply about shows the same affection towards you and tries to help you in situations where you can’t handle it on your own, it means they really care about you. They will not act like they care to get clout from others or try to inflate their own self-esteem.
