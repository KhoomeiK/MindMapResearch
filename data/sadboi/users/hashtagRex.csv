I can't explain it any better than you, but often what you'd think would be a basic easy task, like cleaning, showering, paying the bills, becomes this giant thing that my insides are screaming at me not to do. I've been off from work and home alone for three weeks, so right now like a lot of people I'm at home much more than I was when I went to work every day. Anxiety is pretty high for me, I mean it's a literal global pandemic out there. Keeping up with cleaning is something I need to do, so I kinda made a bargain with myself that if I do something positive I can do nothing for an hour. Do nothing basically means watch tv (not the news), I don't have anything else to reward myself with that's not booze, or weed. Right now I'm cleaning my bathroom, but in pieces. If I clean the sink, I can chill for an hour. Sweep the floor, I can chill for an hour. Piece by piece it ads up. I wish I had a better solution to offer. Good luck!"

I do not live near my parents so it is easier for me to move on and just cut them out of that part of my life. They refuse to talk about my mental health issues and ask me things like 'don't eat your pills around us' or 'don't leave your med bottles on the bedside table- somebody might eat them and get hurt.' So I just cut them out. It has made our relationship difficult- like there's this huge part of me they will never know and I resent them for it. They only know a piece of me, the piece that visits one or two weekends a year. I'll talk to them on the phone every few weeks, but they never visit me, even though I have a lovely house near the ocean with plenty of room. At this point I'm like whatever, your loss. It sucks at first to cut out the people who are supposed to be the ones who care the most, but you eventually have to face the fact that they are incapable of understanding. 

As for your future- don't worry. Stuff works out. I moved here 30 years ago with no contacts, few friends and a basic college degree- and BP2 and PTSD. Now I have a great job that I'm good at. I have a house and a car and dog. I date off and on. I have a few good friends who are like family. I take care of my mental health with therapy, group therapy, meds and willpower. It doesn't always work, sometimes I have episodes of depression or mania, but I get through it. My work boss kinda knows, I have a modified schedule to allow me to go to therapy, but I've lied about being in hospital. Doesn't matter. My real friends know and try to understand- through all the ups and downs. 

Don't doubt the meds. Do work with your doctors to make sure you are on the right dosages and mix of meds. Mine changes every so often.

Hope your insurance crap gets worked out. Sorry your mom isn't capable of being there for something so big."

It's helpful because there are others with similar situations and issues and you get to hear from a bunch of people what they think or feel about what you are talking about. Also after a while you get to really know the other people, better than even your closest friends. It feels good to be actually seen for what you are by a group of people.

bipolar,exttezn,t3_cudqgu,1566574522.0,I'm currently going through this everybody is freaking making me so angry. I called in sick yesterday. Today I closed my office door and am just trying to not scream at everybody. I know I'm depressed- I'm isolating and shutting the world out. It's a miracle I came in today. I just wanna sit at home curled into a ball streaming some show I'll forget immediately .

BipolarReddit,evclzrm,t3_cj9hxu,1564418201.0,"Retail or customer service jobs might not be the best, but if they are your only option you might have to go down that path. 

I work at a University and there are jobs in offices on campus for students. Not just academic offices like the Psychology Dept office, stuff like the Controller's Office, the Bursar or Human Resources. Typically you're filing or making copies or some other kind of boring behind the scenes thing. My office employs two or three every semester and they typically work no more than 15-20 hours a week. I'd ask around campus, tell them you're just looking for like 15 hours a week and you don't mind doing boring, repetitive stuff like filing or copies."

bipolar,eu7yz4i,t1_eu39o7v,1563546143.0,"For me cotton is definitely my favorite. I like flannel shirts and flannel sheets when its fall/ winter. I've tried amazon's 'best seller' sheets that are some kind of synthetic that's softer than cotton, but I prefer the 800 thread count sheets from bed bath and beyond.  I like flannel shirts and flannel sheets when its fall/ winter. 
In the summer I wear LL Bean linen long sleeved shirts- they are super soft. I am always looking for long sleeve cotton tshirts that don't have a cuff and are soft. 
Part of it is just finding what feels best. If I find a shirt of sheets or whatever and I like how it feels I'll buy multiples. I own like five of the same linen shirt I wear to work, and I own it in a few other colors. Sheets are the same, I found some I liked so I bought four sets. 
The biggest issue I have is that the brands that I find I like are more expensive then like Old Navy. I rarely feel like I'm getting a deal, I'm always paying a little more for the extra soft."
bipolar,eu33rg8,t1_eu1uuso,1563404648.0,"I work an office job and sometimes my dress shirts make me itchy and uncomfortable. It’s really bad when I’m manic but does happen when I’m depressed. Depressed it’s different- I mostly just can’t change into anything besides pajamas. I love LL Bean flannels- pjs, shirts, and sheets. It’s worth the $$."
bipolar,eu1ti5i,t3_ced67p,1563375084.0,"I get this way sometimes. Not sure why it happens. I literally can't wear a lot of my clothes because the texture seems irritating or wrong. My skin crawls at being touched, even shaking somebodies hand is horrible. 

I don't have an excuse except to say that typically I wrap myself in super soft flannel pants and shirts and hide out for a few days.

For me it isn't a huge deal, I just need to stay up on my email's. I will also call in sick if I think I am getting manic and I'll take a day to focus on eating and doing some exercise.  I also book extra doctor appointments if I think I'm getting manic."
bipolar,esliend,t3_c8aa2v,1562086223.0,"I have been on and off anti psychotics over the years. I'm 50+, been diagnosed since my early 30's I guess. Right now I'm tapering down the Seroquel  from 300mg to 50mg. Its been a few months of steady reduction, then monitoring my behavior, mood, sleep, etc.  I haven't had a real manic episode for more than a year and I'm feeling mostly ok. 

Congratulations on weening down your meds!"
bipolar2,erxhejw,t3_c4mq7x,1561384799.0,"I'm 50+, have a full time job, own a house (make payments on one at least), have a dog. I do ok, but I'm nowhere near 80% beating this. It took me a long time, most of my 30's and 40's to get here, but I'm ok. I have a whole system of therapy and routines to keep my on the good path, but I still struggle. However at some point the good outweighed the bad in my life and I fell into a groove.

Its not perfect at all and I still have problems, but I don't feel like I'd be better off dead.

This weekend I went to a concert. It was a big stadium show and I went with my friend and a bunch of his friends who I kinda know, but not really because I struggle to go to parties and stuff. I only found out about the show Saturday morning, so I had no pre warning and no time for my brain to say yes then no then maybe then stay home. I actually went. I did ok. It was a lot of talking but if it got to be too much I'd pretend to have to pee or something to get away. I didn't do drugs or drink because I needed to take a benzo so I wouldn't freak out about the crowd and benzos and beer don't mix for me. I have mirrored sunglasses I wear to these things so people can't see my eyes and it creates a barrier that I find helpful.  I made it through the show with out having a panic attack. I got home late- like 2am because of traffic and stuff and then on Sunday I couldn't do a thing. I stayed inside on the couch all day. I didn't speak to anybody or get anything productive done. I tried to go outside but the sun felt poisonous. All the stuff I intended to do didn't get done (except I emptied the dishwasher).  I wish I would have gotten the yard work done and stuff, but I didn't and I guess that's ok. 

So overall I can function well enough that I can have a kinda normal existence. I still have episodes of depression and mania, and sometimes my meds stop working and need to be adjusted and fucking panic attacks happen out of nowhere, but I don't wish I was dead all the time. Sometimes I'm even happy. If only I could find Miss Bipolar 2!"

bipolar,erfa0iq,t3_c1poi5,1560803471.0,"FMLA is a big deal. It sounds like you need a few days off. Using FMLA is like pouring gas to start a fire- its something you can't take back and its a big deal because legally your employer has to do a number of things. If you need a few days off talk to your boss. If you want to take a few weeks, try new meds combo, go to intensive outpatient, or ramp up therapy, then FMLA is good. 

For me my therapist thought I needed it- I was in the middle of divorce and I'd lost 35 lbs. I signed up for intensive outpatient for three weeks and started new meds combos. As soon as I told HR I wasn't allowed back to my office, or near any type of work. I couldn't even tell people about the things I had pending. People from work were not allowed to contact me to see how I was and I wasn't allowed on site. 

After it was over I was kinda known as the person who needed to use FMLA and go the the asylum. I wouldn't say anybody broke the law treating me different, but they treated me differently."
bipolar,eqrngtv,t3_bzd3wb,1560265373.0,"Yup. I had a break up that lead to a hospitalization. I got manic, stopped sleeping and eating and two weeks later I was admitted after passing out at a restaurant. 

Its good that you've noticed you are heading into manic times, can you call your doc and schedule some extra appointments? They might increase your meds for a while to help you sleep. 

Stay safe & get some sleep."
