If you want to start preaching about this, you'd better be living on a hobby farm that produces enough food for you and those who live with you to live off of, using personally owned electrical production through either solar panels or a windmill, and had better not be doing anything to prevent animals from eating your crops.  And drive an electric car that is powered off your renewable electricity stock.  And not using chemical cleaners, because those are terrible for our ecosystem too.

Be it wine, a sauce - anything that would cause her dress to be ruined and force her to go home and change.

If that's too petty for you, maybe make a comment of how embarrassing it is that a wife and mother forgot wedding etiquette, and how bad you feel that she's done something so humiliating.  Nothing stirs gossip and shame around with the aunts than humble shaming."

Basically main girl is lactose intolerant, and the *one time* at school that she decides to drink a carton of milk, it's the one that has her face on it from when she was taken as a young child.
