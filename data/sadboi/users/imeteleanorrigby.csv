trans,foixpkn,t1_foi41m9,1587800601.0,"This. The thing that convinced me was this thought experiment about having a button that would permanently change your gender. My only thought was „sign me up“! 
Still, my self esteem issues don’t make it easier to come out and I still freeze in panic even thinking about it.
I hope, things turn out okay for you. All the best :)"

asktransgender,fo5q74f,t1_fo5ozi3,1587532338.0,"“On the days when you’re fine with being a man, if you were a woman instead & everyone was seeing you and interacting with you on that day as a woman, would you be upset?”
Absolutely not. 

“You sound like you’re scared about the experiences trans people go through”
Yes. I’m short of breath and almost tearing up even thinking about it. I’m not actually sure I’m trans yet but I think the reason I’m hesitating is my fear to face the consequences. I’m absolutely terrified.

I admire all the people who had the guts to come out."
asktransgender,fo5o86n,t1_fo5ng4e,1587530738.0,Idk if I’m in denial or what’s wrong with me. I’ll have to figure it out. Thank you for sharing your story :)
asktransgender,fo5n67h,t1_fo5miio,1587529909.0,"I’m not sure about dysphoria. I don’t really like my body, mainly because I think it’s kind of uncomfortable to look at. I’m very skinny and I have scars from self harming and I’m very insecure about that.
I love it when people call me she in online games and I prefer to be called by my nickname which is kind of a less masculine version of my actual name"
