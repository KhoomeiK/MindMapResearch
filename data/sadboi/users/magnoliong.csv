They all laughed when I set up my mask business,

But who's laughing now?

(You can't tell)



I sell toilet paper as well,

Circulating the pubs, stripping

A few squares here and there,

Then gluing them together with spit

And a bit of elbow grease.



I threw tampons to scatter the tramps.

Tragedy is bad for business

If it is not happening to people with families and homes.



I have my own to look after,

Two little tykes and a wife

Who takes the social distance thing too seriously, 

she went out for kitchen roll

And hasn't come back for two days. 

But she will, I have all the canned goods.



People live for this stuff,

I am giving them life.

Hand sanitizer isn't cheap 

So I mostly save that for customers.

If I get sick then they do too

And sick customers spend spend spend."

musicproduction,eqorhhi,t3_byvyfq,1560191798.0,If you use Ableton they have some decent enough free Orchestral sample packs on the website. And if you don't have the money right now there are quite a few cracks of full VSTs so you don't have to settle for the limits of free software. Obviously you'll buy the proper versions when you're living off your music but for now saving the £200 and still getting to enjoy Serum is worth the fiddliness in my view.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,epc1kjf,t1_epbil5w,1559149190.0,Yeah that's the sort of thing I was thinking. Just a bank of odd textures and samples to give me sounds from left field (not the band). There are so many sample collections out there and I tried this one out and thought it seemed a bit too good to be true with how much was available and accessible. I think I'll give it a go next time I've got some solid hours to dedicate to digital stuff. Thanks a lot.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,epb1ma1,t1_epat8ec,1559136491.0,"Wow that sounds like a crazy job haha. What's your day to day?

&#x200B;

And thanks for the response. I was interested in just utilising the sample base for experimenting with weird sounds. I've used the free trial but just wondered whether it was something people found they used regularly or just for odd bits. Sounds like you find it to be a really useful resource for quickly getting a patch or something together."
