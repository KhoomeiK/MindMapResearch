 ""Bipolar disorder is one of the most damaging mental illnesses, and  Austin audiences got a brutal and honest look at its devastating effects  earlier this month in a pre-screening of A Fine Wife, the debut  documentary by musician-turned-filmmaker Randy White. The film covers  the ecstatic ups and horrifying downs of his marriage to Michelle White,  who was misdiagnosed for most of her life and self-medicated with a  range of drugs until finally committing suicide in 2015. The film was  constructed by White from home movies and video he shot as a record of  her erratic and often dangerous behavior. During the post-screening  Q&A, White (a self-described Texagonian, having moved from Portland  to Austin after Michelle's death) said that he gathered the footage ""so  that I would capture the reality of it, be able to present it back to  her and say, 'What the fuck?'"" He called the film ""a training guide"" to  recognizing what living with someone with bipolar disorder is like, so  that other families won't suffer in the same way his did. He said, ""This  story is not unique. This story has happened millions of times to  millions of different people."""""

RAILER RETURNS - Live in Austin

Railer - A Portland,  OR born and Austin, TX reborn Alt rock band that have been compared as a  mix between Smashing Pumpkins and the Pixies.

When the  band first formed with the original Portland lineup (Randall  Scott/vocals, Zev/bass, Andrew Wisler/guitar, Jason Sechrist/drums, Ray  Rude/keys), Guns-N-Roses' former manager flew the members of Railer to  Los Angeles to play for a gathering of major record labels.

Metallica's  equipment was moved offstage at SIR studios, and lead singer Randall  Scott proceeded to blow the the band's chances at a major label deal by  lap dancing the girlfriend of the president of one of the record  companies while the members of Weezer watched.

Compared  to bands such as the Pixies, New Order, Smashing Pumpkins, and The  Cure, the band signed with Invisible Records in 2003 for the release of  their first album ""Frame of Mind"" (produced by Martin Atkins of Ministry  / Public Image Limited fame).

Their first album ""Frame  of Mind"" landed at number 13 on college music charts, and over the  years Railer has served as an incubator for musicians, including members  who went on to play in Portugal. The Man, Black Veil Brides, and  Builders & The Butchers.

With the tragic death of Randall  Scott’s brother, followed some years later by guitarist DD Desade, the  band took a step back in 2010 and later reformed with new members to  bring forth their sophomore album, ""Zeroes and Ones"".

Then,  after the suicide of singer Randall Scott’s late wife in 2015, Randall  relocated to Austin, Texas where he has reformed the band once more,  this time as a smaller unit including Kevin Kelly (bass) and Chris Strom  (drums).

Railer are currently working on their third album."

Review: A Fine Wife ☆☆☆☆☆

Blown away. I'm hysterical crying  and so is my bps. Our deepest condolences to you are Charlotte. Heart  breaking is not enough to describe your journey. After 33 yrs of living  with this, we know and can relate to EVERY SINGLE moment you've  experienced. This opened up avenues for real conversation for us.  Through you he sees my despair as the spouse. BIG WARM hugs to you and  Char. Happy to supply you with any review of this masterpiece. I pray  that you continue to heal and that you find peace and joy. You are a  wonderful husband and father. You were there 1000% of the time giving  more then you mentally/physically could. Much peace and love to you  always. Thank you, is not enough.

 Wow, what a powerful movie. Thank you so much for sharing this with us.  It is a much needed film that doesn't romanticize the life we go  through with our spouses.

 I have never seen any documentary that shows an up close look of what  it’s like to love someone with bipolar like yours as. I have a feeling  that what you have made here is going to open a lot of eyes. I love that  it shows all sides. The good, the bad, the ugly. The compassion, the  unconditional love, the rage, and most importantly, the forgiveness.

Hiloree B.

\-----------------------

 I am completely speechless. I cried so much and was moved beyond words.  I cannot even fathom what it was truly like for you...just from  watching the footage and your narrative that you shared in the  documentary was truly eye-opening to a disease I never really  understood. The fact that it was in her family and she even warned you  is incredible. After I watched it I felt very reflective and deepened. I  am sad for you and for Char, but grateful that you made this in my  humble opinion award winning documentary that needs to be shared across  the globe. I know this will help others understand what bi-polar is and  Michelle's legacy will help many others who are living with someone who  is afflicted by it or has it themselves - to seek help. Can I just say  to you that I love you Randy. You are a brave man who has been through  so much. Thank you for taking your struggles and channeling it into a  masterpiece. ❤

Star R.

\-----------------------

 Randall that was incredible! Im amazed at the footage you took of  Michele prior to her passing. Such an incredibly moving film. You have a  wonderful talent. This is a story that will reach many and an amazing  gift for your daughter when she's ready to see it.

Tina B.

\-----------------------

 Wtf can anyone possibly say after viewing that. Chronicling your  experience was the right thing to do. If the viewer (me) is left drained  from the precious tragedy of simply viewing that, what would be your  respite?! One of the most moving moments in the film was when you were  walking solo down a road, black cowboy hat, and you so honestly asked,  “Where do we go from here?” So Fucking Real. Such a shared, universal  question. The best, most moving parts for me were your direct commentary  to the camera. The hardest part was hearing you flip your shit...and I  felt your sobs thru my very soul. What struck me throughout was how  beautiful, so very beautiful, Michelle was.

Cynthia R.

\-----------------------

 Your film is deeply moving. It definitely has a few triggers for me,  I’m sure it will for many people, in my case I found that was a good  thing Bc it furthers my own introspection and growth of my mind, heart  and soul. I escaped a relationship with a true toxic pathological  narcissist. Narcissistic personality disorder. Psychopath, sociopath,  narcissist- there is a reason these are the most dangerous and  frightening. Dark triad crap. Ha. Narcissistic abuse survivors- haha I’d  rather tangle with Ted Bundy in the woods. Murder of the body vs slow,  plotted murder of the life, mind and soul? That’s crosses my last line. I  know it’s far different, yet sharing your story I imagine will help  heal and reflect all kinds of people who’ve dealt with all different  types of issues from the people they loved. Thank you for sharing this  with me.

Kristen P.

\-----------------------

That  was the most intense and touching movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry for  what you and charlotte had to endure and I'm so sorry that michelle  wrestled the way she did with addiction and her disorder. Thank you for  sharing your story.

Theresa S.

\-----------------------

 This film is raw and brutally beautiful. The most accurate and genuine  representation of what people close to, those suffering from bipolar, go  through to keep their loved ones happy, safe, and present in their  lives. It's absolutely heartbreaking, yet simultaneously inspiring to  see how hard someone will fight to save their true love from destroying  themselves, and their relationships from a disease so malicious it hides  in plain sight, and leaves no mercy to the victims of its destructive  path. This isn't just a tragic love story though, it's also a tale about  the strength of heart and spirit required to walk away from destructive  relationships with love and empathy still intact.

&#x200B;

""WOW. I’m honestly overwhelmed. 

 First, you did a beautiful job with this film. I’m sure to some this  will be shocking and unbelievable- to me it was raw and realistic. It’s  not something you can explain to people who haven’t witnessed the  devastation that coincides with a brain you can not trust. You did a  wonderful job showing the cycles and the reality of this madness. It’s  still too soon for me to process it all, but none of it shocked me. How  sad that statement is... 

 My husband of 20 years has saved my life. Figuratively for sure, and  maybe more. I doubt he knows how serious I am when I say that I wouldn’t  survive this world without him. Thank you for loving Michelle, and for  giving her a chance at a normal life. My gut literally twisted listening  to her rattle off the things she knew you had enabled her to  experience: her education, owning a home, building a family, having a  career. In the end it was all too much- but you gave her the opportunity  to experience those things. That’s a blessing that I intimately  understand and can attest would not have been possible without the  safety and bravery that comes from being wholly loved. 

Thank you  for loving Charlotte enough to make all of those hard decisions. It is  so evident how much you loved Michelle, and I know that if she could  have been saved you would have saved her from herself. We aren’t all cut  out for this world- and bipolar disorder robs you of the tools  necessary to travel light. But please know that you and Charlotte give  the best parts of Michelle meaning- and that’s fucking beautiful.

 Listening to you read Michelle’s suicide note was so difficult. I  wonder daily the impact of my crazy on my daughters. My story is very  different as I was diagnosed early and have been diligent in my care,  but it’s always there. I won’t give up, but I struggle to be mad at  Michelle. My life without the endless cycle of psychiatry and  medications would be utter chaos and I don’t know that I could have done  it either. But this life is no walk in the park either. I hope she is  at peace. 

I hope that you and Charlotte are happy and thriving.  I’m not asking you to understand, but I do hope that you come to accept  Michelle’s decision. I believe that she truly believed she was doing  this to protect you all because she loved you so much. You are a  beautiful person and you deserve a beautiful life. 

In peace-""
