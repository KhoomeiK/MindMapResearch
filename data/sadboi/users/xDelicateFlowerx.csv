DID,fr0r49g,t3_gljyah,1589804590.0,"Thank you for sharing, I will begin reading it as soon as I can. Some many mental health professionals seem to not be aware or have in depth understanding of dissociative disorders. So to think, 110 years ago it was documented is amazing."
ptsd,fqvsrz0,t3_gkwu87,1589684356.0,"I am a survivor of domestic sex trafficking and I experienced arousal to the same sexual acts being done to me consensually. Not to go into too much detail but I believe survivors of sexual trauma tend to shift to one extreme or the other and then find their own healing with it over time. In my case, hupersexuality has been the side of the spectrum I tend to swing too. 

I used to trigger myself a lot by watching Law and Order SVU. I think it was a way to control my CPTSD and triggered responses while also making what happened to me more real. I suffer from an extreme dissociative disorder which makes it hard to be connected emotionally or logically to the sexual trauma I have experienced.

My reaction to triggers can vary wildly from arousal, disgust, self hatred and a sense of freedom. It depends heavily on whether my defenses are up, if I'm stressed, looking for an escape or trying to process through my trauma."

OCPoetry,fpd6hti,t3_gcrc25,1588520842.0,"I love your poem, and the struggle I interpreted with the person walking down the garden path. My only critique would be the stanza ""How could things have come to this?"" When I read it the first it didn't work for the flow I was experiencing while reading the poem. On my third time through , I removed it but I think it being changed would better than not having it at all. Reading that one section with only three lines definitely didn't sound as good to me as you originally have it. All in all, it's a wonderful poem."
OCPoetry,fpd5s0u,t3_gcrgvk,1588520420.0,"I enjoyed reading your poem but became lost in the flow of ideas and descriptions. My critique would be to add to do some grammatical changes like spacing and punctuation. Organization of thoughts in a poem help me as a reader conceptualize the poem better when reading. 

When I read back through the poem a second time, I was better able to connect the dots between the purple man, and the idea of dreaming. The description of the war, being in locked in a cell and choosing between sight or living in hell was interesting. It kept me wanting to discover the outcome of the purple man. The way you described his sight coming back was beautiful. 

Great poem, OP."
OCPoetry,fpd4h67,t3_gcmh2u,1588519644.0,"First I would like to say, what an interesting and well written poem. I found myself feeling and envisioning each description in your poem. I think the title of poem fits perfectly as well. I also felt very moved by the poem and thought how ordinary acts of human beings can be powerful force. My only critique would  be the last stanza and the ""Gallavant out and about with a starry-eyed Mona Lisa"" . The last line left me with a sense of confusion and the other felt somewhat out of place for me. Overall, it was a wonderful poem and I look forward to reading more of your work."

The current therapist I am seeing is not a good match for me even though she has helped greatly. But with covid its difficult to meet new therpist and find one that will work for me.

I also agree with othe commentors that some people experience SA or CSA and suppress the memories or blame themselves to the point of compartmentalizing that when it happens to someone else they have little to no empathy or compassion. I hope our society grows in this area and learns more about what SA , CSA, and domestic trafficking ng look like and the warning signs.

Its these instances in which my post is referring. But I was able to get through my day. It just hit me hard because it's a reality I'm still adjusting too.

I work around people and many of our customers are older and I almost cry at times thinking I may not see them if they become sick. People where I live are being so greedy taking way more than need as well. But I have also noticed that many people are scared. A woman purchased 30 gallons of milk, which is such a waste but I also believe that she is so flooded with fear that she isn't thinking clearly. Another women was sobbing in a store because she couldn't find toilet paper. My heart goes out to everyone whether their hoarding toilet paper or nonchalantly acting as if this is hoax. People are freaked and I do hope we all start coming together instead of tearing each other apart.

I do think that expecting other people to heals us or take care of us in terms of ""fixing"" is unhealthy. But I have also learned that I need healthy people in my life who are willing to walk this journey with me, not for me, in order to continue healing.  A therapist once explained it to me like this, I have trauma stemming from past experiences with many big ""T"" and little ""t""  however, ultimately all the trauma I experienced is rooted in relationships with self, others, and my community. I need healing in each area in order to relearn and manage my current and past trauma responses. So yes, I must foster self compassion and healing from within but I also need to experience safe, healthy, and caring relationships in my life. It's sort of like finding a happy medium between reparing the many facets of relational trauma while not ""expectating"" others to do it for me."

Some books made for survivors but very informational are, ""Body Keeps the Score"", ""From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker"", ""Trauma and Recovery by Judith Herman"" ( she is actually the therapist who coined and discovered CPTSD). And as for DID materials, I was recently diagnosed with OSDD so I am unsure of any books and resources outside of trauma.org and a Youtuber I follow called Silver. She is a system and explains alot both DID and OSDD and in a way that people with systems and allies can understand. I hope this helps and others comment with more info for you.

I have done the same thing in an attempt to remove the assault from existence. At the time I had no idea it was even a trauma repsosne to being assaulted.

I remember mentioning it to a therapist and she was almost surprised that I had been that bad. I think there is an idea that once someone has been a victim and/or survivor then, generally speaking they aren't capable of being shitty. I think everyone is capable regardless of whether a person was the victim or abuser. 

I hope though you are able to forgive yourself and still realize that you deserve a good life regardless of the bad stuff you may have done. Oh and as mentioned earlier seeking out professional help like with a therapist may help as well with healing if,its something you find right for you."

Crying in the fetal position, angry out burts, self harm, revealing clothing, and individuals who were clearly to old to be running my life would be let into my home through the front door. 

I think the one time I recieved clarity was right before my mother passed away. We bonded in a way that never happened before and she said she was sorry. She saw what was happening but she said she didn't know how to protect me. We were both gonna run away together and start over then she passed. I guess I'm lucky that at least one adult admitted to it in the end and recognized something was wrong. The rest of both my families (I'm adopted) still think its just what happens to people using drugs. Like yeah children are trafficked when they act bad, oh well. 

Sorry for the wall OP, I hope at some point you receive peace or clarity. It blows my mind that no one saw what was happening with you and idly stood by. No child should be treated like their invisible."

A trauma incident a few years prior and around when I was nine sparked my mental illness. Years of many traumas, emotional abuse, feeling abandoned since i am adopted and then later in teen years my addiction began. 

All in all, i have been diagnosed with ODD, bi polar, BPD, Depression, PTSD, GAD, panic disorder, anti social disorder, psychosis and a few others I think. The only ones that are "" accurate"" are CPTSD which includeds depression, ptsd related psychosis, and anxiety disorder."
mentalillness,fimv8m1,t3_f8lclz,1582548103.0,"I believe everyone finds success or a better life in their own way. I also dont like the bias that because some or many people completely people recover doesn't mean everyone will. We are all so different and effected by mental illness, obesity, addiction, ect. in different ways. 

My therapist truly believes that one day I will be cured of my CPTSD but I disagree. At times I believe she has to have the hope to continue helping me versus me actually needing. I personally see a better life at being able to work a job with meaning so I no longer have to worry about poverty every single day. And be stable enough to have a few friends and meaningful relationship. I wouldn't define it as a cure but maybe achieving a decent life. 

With that said, everyone experiences is valid. No one has to play rescue ranger and I believe people need to accept where a person is at instead of trying to change them or find them the exception to the rule."
CPTSD,fi8j822,t3_f6yd0k,1582241520.0,"I can relate somewhat with your experience in that I experienced so many levels of severe trauma that I began compartmentalizing it. I made up imaginary friends at like nine and since grew into like 5 different personas or shattered selves. It was a coping mechanism for me to keep living in such a chaotic environment and not completely fall apart from it. I'm super sensitive as well so literally locking parts of myself away in different areas in my psyche kept me somewhat sane. 

The ""T"" I see thinks I'm somewhere between severe dissociation and DID but I honestly dont think its DID since my symptoms experiences seem very different from those diagnosed with it. I also haven't found a way to make it go away nor think I need too. Maybe its because I haven't fully settled into a non trauma life. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I do relate and definitely think its strongly linked to trauma."

ptsd,fhsm1hv,t3_f4oixq,1581862584.0,"I don't think trauma occurs less over time but rather the circumstances and treatment of trauma do. Experiencing trauma and developing PTSD is a ""normal"" part of human development. Meaning humans have adapted to find a way to live through trauma. Also, what is classified as a traumatic today may not have been over the course of history. I think r*pe culture exists because this heinous act has been normalized for a long time in the sense that it continued to happen but little acceptance, change or treatment was provided to victims. 

I think this can be seen today in the society I live in and even globally. Acts like incest amongst tribes and royal families was considered normal in earlier times. Young girls were commonly married off to older men and this is what we describe as phillia nowadays and yet still occurs in some countries. These acts were and can still be viewed before as normal traumatic acts to commit against other others. So, yes I think types of trauma have been  ""normalized"" by cultures but also I think trauma is woven into the fabric of the human experience. Meaning its happens globally and is tolerated or punished by different standards depending on the culture.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fhoixpz,t3_f43jz6,1581759149.0,"I was able to stay clean in NA but had a lot of experiences that agitated my CPTSD. I ended up leaving completely over 6 months ago. The fear of using went away and I no longer have any drug dreams. It's definitely possible to stay clean/sober without 12 step programs. I kept what worked for me from the program and let go of the rest. It's been an adjustment but everything I do for my MH is the exact same thing I need for my recovery. 

For instance, working, listening to calming music, reaching out to others for support but also seeking out like minded healthy individuals. Volunteering even in small ways, eating right, not isolating, and going to therapy. Working through my trauma has had a huge impact on my life and recovery. Finding what works personally for each person's recovery I think is crucial."
survivorsofabuse,fhl5hny,t3_f3owyc,1581695578.0,"I can relate to this stage of recovery through trauma. Once I started adjusting to a new norm which did not involve abuse. The yearning to return to what I knew lessened. It's not completely gone but its definitely gotten better. I also do therapy to help me and learned that talking about it with a T or in a ""safe"" support group helped me to not feel so alone and judgemental towards myself for feeling this way. Learning to live outside of active trauma and the predicatability/familiar acts we learned to survive through will take time and finding what works best for you.

CPTSD,fhhekbi,t1_fhgwm2x,1581602274.0,"| I used to wonder what was wrong with me, then it kind of became ""there is something wrong, but it's not me it's what I've been through""|

This part right here helped me so much! I have been struggling for awhile on making sense of my past,  living authentically and non-judgementally in the present, while holding onto to hope for the future. This reframe of how I can choose to see myself will help me move one step closer to finding some inner peace."
ptsd,fhajk3j,t3_f1wwhv,1581413784.0,"I relate with this so much. It wasn't till about a few years ago that loving, kind, and honest people entered my life. I always that before they arrived in my life that I was inherently bad or I was somehow bringing it on myself. But its total bull. I was still me through and through and hadn't done a lot of inner healing work. And you know what? Most of my close friends and even my SO  tell me that loving me comes naturally to them and it isn't a struggle. 

I think growing up around so many toxic and abusive people that I began to believe that I was hard to love or the ""problem"". The abusers and toxic people are the problem and chose to take advantage of others. I hope one day you are able to feel loved, validated, and appreciated. I agree with other commenters that boundaries are a must have when socializing with people. 

Wishing you the best!"

survivorsofabuse,fgvuxp8,t3_f0kr5s,1581153363.0,"Hey OP, your experience is valid and I am sorry that you have had to live through such a horrific experience. There is a sub just for men who have been abused. It might also be helpful for you. r/MenGetRapedToo

Also, I am not sure what has been said so far. But getting into therpay helped me a lot and finding a few friends I could trust to talk too about my experience. Finding support groups also helped me feel less isolated while the memories started coming back. I do hope you are able to find healing sooner than rather than later."
mentalhealth,fgmn48x,t3_ez0zpk,1580927974.0,I agree wholeheartedly! Its tuff for me as well to make a reply to each person but just reading this post gave me courage to engage. Good stuff OP!
CPTSD,fglw5tr,t3_ez3b7h,1580912391.0,"I can relate with your experience. I also live alone and have been on my own since 17 for losing my mom. Its tuff to balance ""normal"" obligations while handling all of my MH responsibilities. And I just started working again to prevent me from becoming homeless or moving in with my SO. He is super understanding and patient but lately our relatioship has been strained. 

At work, I keep cool and try to appear as a fun, carefree 27 yr old. I work in a fast pace  customer service environment so I'm constantly making small talk, greeting customers and doing my best to not mess up. All the while my anxiety is so bad that my chest hurts after each shift. To keep myself going I literally just tell myself I can quit life at anytime. Its morbid but it helps me feel less like I'm trapped till whatever this is passes, well hopefully. 

Definitely having a small support circle can add to this. I totally get the anxiety in bonding with new humans. I do hope adulting and balancing CPTSD gets better for you. In whatever way you define better."
mentalillness,fggnxjs,t1_fggegdf,1580765792.0,I appreciate your answer and I apologize I made a typo. I was asking for anyone who is diagnosed or living with the mental illness not for myself.

ptsd,fgc8of7,t1_fgc5njj,1580670218.0,"Of course! And yeah it can take awhile to sort through everything. It was like that for me and still is. It takes time to figure out what caused the PTSD or maybe agitated it through other traumatizing life experiences. I know something that helped me in the beginning was making a hierachry of my trauma. I decided what's at the top or bottom by how much it still affects me presently. A previous therapist was the one who suggested I do it. If you ever want to talk feel free to dm anytime. 

Oh and I hope the healing comes soon for you rather than later. Even just a little."
ptsd,fgbdp9s,t3_exlwka,1580661062.0,"Yes, yes, and yes. I have had severe MH and CPTSD since I was a child and things I did to myself physically have created another level of trauma. Much of the physical stuff I inflicted on myself will never heal and I will carry permanent scars on my body which are very visible for the rest of my life. 

You are definitely not alone and your experience is valid. I also agree with the other commenters that seeking help if you decide to could be beneficial. You are worthy and deserving of help and healing.

CPTSD,fg60d5t,t1_fg5gpz6,1580547085.0,Thank you so much for your repsosne. Its nice to know that this part of my journey is a stage and not the destination.
CPTSD,ffvxmua,t3_evfnwh,1580276435.0,"I relate with this so much. After learning of my situation being much darker than I ever knew and memories resurfacing of how so many individuals could have stopped it and did nothing. The resentments I have honestly eat me alive. It's strange really that most of my family and adults/caregivers saw what was happening but assumed I was just a troubled kid. Yet, they knew it was illegal however, I was the only one to blame. This has been one of the hardest parts of my healing is realizing no one ever came for me or stopped the pain. 

I hope one day you are able to make it through this in whatever way works best for you. You didnt deserve to not be seen or heard as a child. Children should not be invisible."

ptsd,ffip2er,t1_ffikk6k,1579979183.0,"Hey OP, with a partner of mine I actually found a list of things to say to them online. I was trying to find it now but I believe I have a copy on my laptop. Basically, I took the statements and rephrased them to fit my specific triggers or challenges I am working on. With my current SO, I have learned through therpay and other resources what my needs are. One big one is sometimes I cannot be touched. I let my partner and he understands. Or I let him know that when I become emotional and irrational that I need to step away to regulate my emotions. I let him know this so it doesnt come off like I am shutting down emotionally or giving him the silent treatment. 

It takes a lot of practice for sure. But I have learned over time that being open and honest, owning my stuff and admitting when I have crossed the line or need something, most often than not we work it out. 

Oh and if I find the list would you like a copy? And best of luck to you on journey too!"
CPTSD,ff3amc5,t1_ff2unp1,1579537479.0,"The last sentence hit me hard, "" But I know my story and this is my happy ending."" I have missed many years of opportunities and have several wisha, shoulda, coulda, but I have been able to gain my truth and that is priceless. Some people walk around aimlessly and then leave this earth never knowing."
CPTSD,ff2g68q,t3_er66bo,1579504734.0,"I agree with this wholeheartedly. I am not a person who responds well to responses like that. Especially, the one ""it's in the past"", like yeah I know that but the symptoms of CPTSD clearly indicate that my brain is wired to ""relive"" the moments of trauma that happened in the past. I almost think at times that those phrases equate well to ""just get over it."" I mean if could I wouldn't be paying for therapy lol."
CPTSD,feyimk1,t3_equc8n,1579445952.0,"Everyone definitely doesnt share this worldview but there a lot of broken systems in place that foster child abuse. 

For instance, in my situation as well, cops, my family, teachers,counselors, high school friends,  their parents, and social workers new of and in my mothers case she saw the individuals subjecting me to CSA. My mother did not do those things but rather did nothing except call me names and viewed me as being an ungrateful child, while knowing that what was happening to me was  illegal. 

l think it's one of the hardest things survivors of child abuse go through. Children should be protected not victim-blamed or reprimanded for finally speaking up. I hope if you are able to reach out again that someone listens, believes you, and does something about it. Sending healing and love if wanted. ❤"

ptsd,fenhs93,t3_epz26j,1579284974.0,"I find this study and the other research articles posted recently  to be very interesting. I truly hope though that natural occurring physiological protective functions dont become viewed as maladaptive. Because honestly, the symtpoms described in the research article are the actions our primitive brain takes in order to save our lives in traumatic situations. I agree that intervention and preventive care is a must. But I also think reducing trauma in its many forms, providing adequate awareness and education could also potentially reduce later development of chronic PTSD."

I hope were both able to make it out the other side. It truly is bizarre and almost makes me wonder what my mother when through. I know her husband died several years before she adopted my brother and me. I think sometimes that she was so afraid of relying on another man that she trusted me to handle things that she believe my brother would be incapable of handling simply due to him being a guy. 

I hope at some point I can move past it and grow from realizing how unhealthy some aspects of my upbringing was. I also hope the same for you."

CPTSD,fdz2oxy,t1_fdyqrzj,1578786042.0,"I'm glad it helped you. I often struggle to find the words to express what I am feeling and I too do not want to continue the cycle. I can say that when I caught myself it definitely showed me how much I have  improved over the years. I also can relate with you in that my SO treats me so well. I think being aware and having a strong commitment to repeat the cycle while working on selves will prevent doing to others what has been done to us. 

Wishing you well."
