tappedout,fr4baor,t1_fr49wl8,1589882495.0,I do see him in other Springfields but he’s not running away he has a knife and when i type on him nothing happens!
TheVampireDiaries,fr4b9de,t1_fr49bie,1589882458.0,Yeah it doesn’t prevent me from sleeping either aha. I’m just really curious and like debating 😌 Yeah some people only care about their ships and not even the storyline or other characters :/
TheVampireDiaries,fr4b5el,t1_fr493qw,1589882345.0,"Same! But honestly that makes him just more real. In the show every character stereotype him as the perfect good guy but i like that sometimes he’s annoying lmao. It makes him more human and it makes the show more coherent. Otherwise it would be too idealized. And i like being angry at my favorite characters too sometimes because it’s just like in real life, even the person you love the most annoy you and do wrong things at time.

LMAO i saw the grinch tweet!!!😂 Not to criticize appearance at all but one thing i also don’t like is how the mimics of Damon were SO sexy before the real life break and then boom he couldn’t act anymore around nina. His acting annoyed me during late seasons and nina’s too at times 🤦🏽‍♀️ but i get it, it’s awkward.

That’s just wrong to come at an actor’s appearance omg. And like you said it has nothing to do with the character. I also did notice nina’s physical change and it just surprised me because i couldn’t get why she looked so different but it’s normal. They started the show in 2009. Do they expect them to stay 20 forever and be real lives vampires ?"
TheVampireDiaries,fr4at1m,t1_fr48xsq,1589881991.0,"Yeah i agree too. I felt for Damon especially during the early seasons. I can understand when Stefan blames Damon because they are brothers and it’s normal that they fight given their history. But when everyone think so this is when i have a problem, this show is too much into stereotypes. Just like everyone thinks elena is pure and sweet and can never do wrong 🙄"
TheVampireDiaries,fr4aplg,t1_fr48kmx,1589881891.0,"Yeah i saw this also. I don’t really understand because for me if people get kill as a shock factor, yes it’s fun bcs it’s a vampire show, but it’s part of the storyline. I don’t associate it with the character. That’s why i love what Damon and Klaus bring to the show but it’s also good that not everyone is like them because otherwise the show would be just an incoherent bloodbath."
SuicideWatch,fr48auy,t3_gma8gz,1589879394.0,Personally in my religion there is an afterlife. We believe that this life is just a test and that once you die you’re still conscious. That’s why the body must be respected. Once you’re in your grave you feel everything and still hear and see but can’t move... And you wait until judgement day. That’s why i don’t have the balls to kill myself because i’ve read descriptions of hellfire and i’m so freaking scared.
TheVampireDiaries,fr4842q,t1_fr478gy,1589879196.0,"Exactly! It doesn’t make sense to ship people just for their amazing scenes together because for example the motel kiss could have been given to anyone really. 

Also i don’t mind the fact they made out right after it because i understand that they hold back for so long but they could have just made this « second first kiss » genuine without any sexual connotation. I don’t mind lust but they are supposed to love each other before lusting over each other. They could have just make them hug and damon caressing her face like he usually does. It would have been so cute and 10x better in my opinion. Also jeremy walking on them made me feel so CRINGE 🤢😂"
TheVampireDiaries,fr46oye,t1_fr45nfo,1589877718.0,"Yes that’s exactly what i think too. And after the mess delena was i knew it would never happen but i don’t see how Elena could have choose Damon. The whole delena thing was so unfunctional it just proved stefan was the right choice. In my opinion, with Delena scenes when they were dating iconic sceneswere there (rain kiss and more..), some iconic quotes and songs were thrown and that’s what made it so appealing.

Hearing about delena and watching delena edits before i started tvd, i thought i was going to ship them. But boi I WAS SO WRONG. They feel so superficial, there is no depth to their relationships. They almost feel forced and fake. But stelena they were magic, epic. Like you said i could feel the love through the screen. People call healthy relationships boring 🤦🏽‍♀️ If i was Elena i would have gladly spend eternity with Stefan."
TheVampireDiaries,fr45bps,t1_fr44v3t,1589876338.0,Exactly. There’s no denying Elena and Damon had something before they started dating but then they just threw the vampire thing and made it 10x times easier for them to get together. The thing that was very appealing with them was the internal conflict/forbidden thing. But they ruined it. To sum up : You want two characters to be together ? Change everything about the first one’s personality to avoid all illogical things and obstacles lmao.
TheVampireDiaries,fr444ei,t1_fr3ockc,1589875146.0,"Same. I hate that they had to change her whole personality to make her date damon, it doesn’t make sense. They disguised it as elena being a vampire the problem but i know it was just for plot convenience because when she turned only « her feelings for damon were magnified ». But not that compassion part of herself, not her strong feelings for stefan, not her kindness and everything we saw in the previous seasons. She just turned into a total narcissistic. She was selfish, annoying and rude sometimes (especially with people who are only trying to help her). And she was obsessed with damon. It was unhealthy. It felt forced unlike the previous delena s1-s3."
TheVampireDiaries,fr43tsl,t1_fr3d7se,1589874865.0,No. Stefan also says to elena in 5x18 « we fell in love on our own ». And then when they’re both pretty aware they are soulmates he says « i’ll always love you elena » to which she replies « i will always love you too ». https://youtu.be/8eFMwdGmmxw
TheVampireDiaries,fr30omz,t1_fr2ycqa,1589847591.0,Yes i loved the 6x22 dance too and delena have some pretty iconic scenes that i loved as well! But for me it will always be stelena 😌 I wish they were endgame too and i’m happy we got to see the flashbacks of their future together during season 5 because i can picture how lovely they would have been and at least i can pretend this is them in a parallel universe aha
TheVampireDiaries,fr2spyc,t1_fr2p6u5,1589843154.0,"Exactly ! I loved that Damon loved elena so much but so did stefan. The one thing that did it for me was stefan and elena were amazing together and so functional. They were so healthy. With what we have seen of delena during season 5 i can’t picture them growing up together like i do with stelena because there’s just passion, argument and solving arguments with sex. Otherwise they almost never communicates, never do fun things like going on a cute date or hanging with their own friends. Also, they are 24/7 with each other, it’s like they can’t function without each other it’s unhealthy for me."
TheVampireDiaries,fr2qcdn,t1_fr2e9aw,1589841884.0,Yeah i agree. And i also don’t like romanticizing abuse. Like it’s fine if there’s an abusive relationship in the show because sometimes it happens in real life but when they start acting like it’s healthy it’s just EW
tappedout,fr2q7r0,t1_fr2i0kv,1589841816.0,Oh i see! They could have fixed the issue for everyone then lmao
TheVampireDiaries,fr2q4hx,t1_fr2g2gq,1589841768.0,Klaroline was THE shit.
TheVampireDiaries,fr2pqe6,t1_fr2fngt,1589841562.0,"Yes. I understand that they wanted to explore delena but they should have at least give them a better ending. In my opinion, the best thing they could have done was stopping the love triangle. It was just so hard to watch elena breaks stefan’s heart over and over again. And i’m not saying this because she moved on, but at one point she clearly wanted them to both still love her. First she started becoming rude to stefan, she couldn’t stop talking about her and damon in front of stefan and then when he finally moves on and sleep with rebekah she’s mad. What the actual fuck."
TheVampireDiaries,fr2p0r9,t1_fr2ff9a,1589841186.0,So true! I got into the show hearing only about delena and i thought i was going to ship them more than any ship i ever had. But it ended up being stelena for me :)
TheVampireDiaries,fr2owan,t1_fr2mqhb,1589841123.0,"I know right. That’s why there are plenty couples in the show. No matter who the character ends up with, you can always come back and rewatch the precious moments of your ship. No need to hate other shippera"
TheVampireDiaries,fr2dgf2,t1_fr2cog2,1589835390.0,Agree omg! Season 2 is definitely amazing too but the originals were epic.
TheVampireDiaries,fr2cnrz,t1_fr2brl2,1589835001.0,"I agree. Shipping is literally about preference, i don’t understand ship wars"
TheVampireDiaries,fr2bcx7,t1_fr2an6g,1589834369.0,"Sorry i don’t understand, are you referring to me? Or the toxic stans i mentioned in my post ?"
TheVampireDiaries,fr2b6mo,t1_fr28y76,1589834283.0,Yes! Tyler and Caroline were similar to delena in a way because they were a bit toxic (with tyler’s angry issues) yet still epic. But in my opinion they were written a 100 times better than delena WHILE they were together. Relationships and the show in general were so much so much deeper and better during season 1-3.
TheVampireDiaries,fr2aq0k,t1_fr296gc,1589834053.0,I agree with you!
TheVampireDiaries,fr26dl2,t1_fr24tdr,1589831922.0,"Yes it’s one of my issues with delena. They made elena become another person by season 4, as if she couldn’t be with damon as her old self. It sends the wrong message. You shouldn’t have to change yourself to be with the person you love.

And i agree delena s1-s3 was fantastic and iconic. I shipped both during these times. They ruined everything after that. There’s so many things that make me feel like delena is wrong (and tbh a bit disgusting) like the sirebond [i know it doesn’t affect feelings but it almost like she was her slave, she did everything that made him happy and she had sex with him during these times 🤢], the damon killing jeremy part, the selfish elena she has become, the absurd arguments and the whole crazy sex obsessed thing..

It’s like after they got together Julie didn’t know how to make it passionate anymore so she just made them having rough sex 24/7 lmao. I would have loved to see damon and elena evolving like i pictured it in my mind. If elena remained the same person she was during the first seasons delena would have truly be incredible."
TheVampireDiaries,fr254h2,t1_fr24sos,1589831313.0,"Exactly! And even the little things like the way he touches her hair to comfort her, gives her many hugs and their little dates are so cute 🥺 Their love was epic. Even the quotes, like when Klaus said “crazy or not, that kind of love never dies” ! I loved delena before they got together, after that it was just sex and toxicity."
TheVampireDiaries,fr24e1w,t1_fr22gsn,1589830956.0,Exactly! Like you said they had it all. There was still drama to make it interesting but i always thought that i was such an healthy relationship considering all of the issues they had to deal with!🥺
TheVampireDiaries,fr242w1,t1_fr2272d,1589830803.0,"Exactly! And why did she have to make everyone obsess over them anyway ? Stefan and caroline didn’t have to only talk about them during season 4. And even people who « stand up » to this couple during the other seasons, i feel like it was just a way for us to pity damon because everyone is like « damon is a bad guy and he doesn’t deserve elena ». Then damon is sad and says they are toxic and elena is like “i don’t care about all of the awful things that you have did”. Repeat this about 500 times and we have season 4-6!! (Joking of course) 😂😂"
TheVampireDiaries,fr23nwi,t1_fr225ct,1589830597.0,You mean steroline right ? I thought they were cute and i respect your ship :) But if stelena was not going to be endgame i would rather have Stefan/Katherine and Caroline/Klaus together. But that’s just my opinion!
TheVampireDiaries,fr20sez,t1_fr1zvuf,1589829194.0,"Yeah i understand your point of view but personally i almost felt like Julie was afraid of delena stans lmao. I love the idea of making damon better but why always bringing up the fact that it’s for elena only?? Shouldn’t damon change for himself. When he truly did like with rose or bonnie, i absolutely loved it!

What i don’t like is downgrading stefan just for plot convenience and to prove damon is better. Damon kills people ? Oh but it’s because he suffered too much. Stefan is a ripper addicted to blood and fighting every single day but loses control and killing someone ? Elena acts like he’s the worst person ever.

And like you said, Julie was pretty aware fans LOVED bonnie and enzo together. Killing Enzo was fucked up enough but who did she choose to make him kill him ?  Stefan of course. Because stefan is so lovable she had to do stupid shit like this to justify killing him lmao. I don’t hate the fact that stefan died, i love it actually but Stefan was already so selfless. She could have just make him sacrificing himself without « ruining » his character to justify damon and elena ending up together."
TheVampireDiaries,fr1zhrh,t1_fr1ysl7,1589828574.0,"Exactly! And it’s another topic but to add to your original post, what the fuck was that « damon is the better man » lmao??? I swear julie plec tried to brainwash us. Like hello, we watched the show. Stefan saying this just prove once again how selfless he was. 

[I love Damon but c’mon stefan was a thousand times a better man]."
TheVampireDiaries,fr1z2r8,t3_gcasf8,1589828371.0,Yes. Not to be annoying but Klaroline had so much potential. Plec truly ruined an epic love story.
TheVampireDiaries,fr1v7m2,t3_gdsbcw,1589826508.0,Stefan
TheVampireDiaries,fr1ur3g,t3_glljsa,1589826289.0,This!! And the fact that every single character became stereotyped. In the end it was just about « the good guys » vs « the bad guys » but it wasn’t even accurate. Katherine had so much potential for redemption before they ruined a character! She suffered her whole life. Yes she did awful things but her background story was what made some of us love her despite of everything. And in 8x16 she just came back to be this lame ass vilain + the whole plot with vicki and the donovan’s mom seeking revenge was irrelevant 🤦🏽‍♀️

unpopularkpopopinions,fqxasy0,t3_g9c70s,1589729120.0,"Same. I like Lisa but it’s not like the other members. There’s something about her that « annoys » me?? I think like you, it’s mostly the fact that she’s overhyped as fuck. When people start stanning blackpink they only care about lisa. Personally rosé and jennie have always been my favorites.

I love her rapping and she’s cute and funny but for example lisa stans literally worship her and picture her as a goddess. I tried to see what’s so special about her but i really don’t see it. I find her beautiful but she’s definitely not the most gorgeous blackpink member or kpop girl like they claim.

I also hate the fact that everyone ships her with everyone and they claim that every male idol is crushing on her. I love blackpink sm but lisa is definitely my least favorite member."
u_RolandJFallenHero6,fqvh8be,t3_gl2jwo,1589677210.0,"Hey you. 💕It’s been a while ! This world was not meant to be perfect otherwise paradise would lose its value. Have you reflected on what we talked about ? I understand if you don’t chose islam but trust me, only Allah can help you get through this.

Allah says in the quran that whoever turns away from his remembrance will have a depressed life. We were all born muslims, then our parents « chose » our religions. There are many many stories of people who were about to die or who were depressed and who found Allah and Allah saved them.

I only want what’s best for you, you seem like a great person that’s why i hope one day inshallah Allah guides you. If you ever decide to read the quran you will understand. If you chose Allah, you will never be alone. For every single pain you will experience, there will be a reward in the next world.

If they were nice guys they wouldn’t have done this + the first one had anger issues and told me himself he did messed up things to his first girlfriend.

They also were pretty insistant and i felt uncomfortable. As soon as i said no they dated another girl. So it just shows that they didn’t want me. They wanted anyone, really."

But again, the second guy was of my religion and he was an ass so.. lmao.

And in my religion we believe that every person that you met God sent him/her for a purpose (to teach your a lesson for example).

I understand having no social skills. Are there people at your work who’s around your age ?

Try to associate rape with disgust/hate and suffering not intimacy. It’s just violence. Let’s say you’re straight and someone of the same gender rapes you would you be okay with it ? (I just took this example but it could be the other way around)."

During these 3 years i made a lot of sacrificed and i don’t want it to be in vain. I’m scared that it’s just the depression talking and that if i change i will end up regretting it in a few years. There’s also the « pressure » that comes with changing because i will feel like a failure either way. I don’t really know why.

If i had a realistic dream job i would be the happiest person in the world. I would change immediately to do what i love."

I don’t know what you’re going through but i do know the pain of being alone because i’ve been since i was born. But i can’t imagine finally finding it and then it all disappears.

What i do know, is that he loved you until his last day and he would surely want you to be happy. I’m not telling you to force things, just do it day by day as you have done for already 8 years (again you can be proud for being so strong).

He’s probably watching over you. He will love you forever now, just like a part of you will always love him and remember him. One day you will find someone else, he will never take his place but you deserve to meet someone. You deserve to be happy. I understand that for now you don’t want to but things change, maybe in 10 years from now your life will be transformed.

There are many people in life that will love you that you have not met yet. And there are many incredible things that you will do and become that did not happen yet. As long as God keeps you on this earth, it means that you still haven’t accomplished your purpose. Life is like this. One day for you and one day against you.

You probably never thought something as awful would happen, so why can’t something truly wonderful happen in your life as well ? I’m here if you need anything, i’m sending you lots of love and prayers 💕"

My family is very dramatic too but i wouldn’t call the cops on them. My parents also fight very frequently ever since i was young and sometimes they say disturbing things that really messed up with my head i guess.

I can’t really explain. Sometimes they’re sweet, sometimes they’re awful. And for some reason i’m always the bad guy. Also my sister is quite successful in her studies so i’m the piece of shit of the family. They don’t understand mental illness.

Truth being said, i’ve wanted help for a long time but after being called an attention seeker and much worse things i just don’t care tbh. I don’t want someone to follow me medically or anything like that. I’m better off on my own.

Then college happened and depression hit me hard and i stopped studying. My mom values school far more than my mental health. My grades are awful and everyone just treat me like a failure, even my friends.

I’m kind of not going to have a job.

When my mom found out about my eating disorder (in high school) she beat the hell out of me instead of helping me and it traumatized me. She thought i was just faking it and it was ridiculous.

2) Like i said, i’m really dumb. I won’t make it in life as an adult. I’m just really really awkward and dumb af.

3) Never had any relationship and probably never will.

4) I have an eating for years now and my mom bully me for it. It was anorexia at first but turned to binge eating and now my sister and mom both call me a fatty.

5) I’m already ugly enough, now i’m overweight and my body really looks awful.

6) After being hurt by people i started isolated myself and i developed social anxiety. It’s hell going outside for me. I do have friends that i met a long time ago. But i don’t get anything out of life anymore : i never meet anyone (actually i met 2 people this year and they were dick to me lol), i don’t do what people who are 20 normally do. I still behave like a teenager.

7) I’m failing hard at my studies and i kind of want to drop everything.

I’m glad you have find something that makes you feel better. Personally i was born a muslim but never really learned about my religion. But ever since last year, i started to read about it and i fell in love. I know that medias give a really bad and violent image of it but it’s really not the truth. The religion itself ls filled with love and most importantly -for me- hope. But like any other religion, it is the « believers » who interpret wrong or try to justify their evil doings.

Don’t feel ashamed about your beliefs. If it makes you feel better that’s what’s more important !💕

I agree with you about the suffering part but you know God never does anything without purpose. Suffering has a purpose and sometimes the people who have it all (fame, money, love...) are still depressed. 

Despite feeling hopeless sometimes, i’m convinced that our lives have purpose and that one day we will also meet that person who will love us unconditionally, or have that job who will bring us success and happiness or anything else destined for us, really! 💕

Which religion have you discovered -if it’s not too personal- ? I also do believe in one religion, which is why despite having suicidal thoughts i struggle so much to take action. Religion helped me for a while too, and it keeps me alive. Otherwise i would be long gone.

Don’t be sorry, it’s actually relieving to hear other people who are struggling as well -not that i wish that to you or anyone.- When people just tell me « you’ll be fine, there are worse things in life » and then go one with their lives, i feel even worse.

Maybe you don’t want to hear positive stuffs but.. there are SO many people on this world. It’s impossible that no one finds you attractive. Even if you were the ugliest man on the planet i can guarantee you that you’d be handsome in the eyes of someone.

Beauty is subjective. You haven’t find the one for you yet. What about the women who feels just like you ? Just focus on being a good person, on your goals and love will come to you. I’m sure it will.


+ i’ve happened to find men who weren’t my type at all extremely attractive due to their personality. Maybe you’re extremely kind, maybe you’re a hard worker or very generous.. It could be anything !
