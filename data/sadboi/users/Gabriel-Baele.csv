Christian,f6xuv3i,t1_f6xupkk,1573259200.0,"> The dead know nothing

This is obviously false because Christ talks about the OT Patriachs awaiting his coming, they hear his preaching in hades too. John the Baptist descended to hades to preach before Christ, obviously the dead know things. Ecclesiastes is before the harrowing of Hell so this is irrelevant, the dead are not 'dead' anymore, they are fully alive in Christ.

> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

The saints praying for us is not them mediating our interactions with the Father. For example:

We pray to Saint -> saints pray to Christ -> Christ mediates to -> The Father. 

There is still only one mediator here, just like if you asked me to pray for you (which the Bible instructs us to do)

""Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed""

Whether its from a 'dead' person or one living in the flesh is irrelevant, if me praying for you is not breaking the 'one mediator' clause then the saints in heaven praying isn't either.

Im not sure what point 3 is mean't to refer to. 

> “You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; (Exodus 20:4)

Read St John of Damascus. Christ is truly human, we can represent human nature, we aren't Muslim heretics.

God himself tells people to decorate the tabernacle with images of heavenly beings:

""Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and crimson yarns; you shall make them with cherubim skillfully worked into them"" (Exodus 26:1)

""There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the covenant, I will deliver to you all My commands for the Israelites""

You need to read some serious theology instead of trying to blinding interpret Biblical quotes.

> Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.

We agree. Interesting question for you, if we can only come to the Father via Christ, what are we to say of the acts of the holy spirit? If the saints praying for us is a break in this clause then surely the holy spirit influencing us is also. Or maybe you're being overly literal (not even literal, you're stretching the quote far beyond its meaning)

> What is wrong with these people that pray to saints, why don't they read their Bibles

Maybe its because we have read our Bibles that we do. Anyway, where do you think the Bible came from? The apostles, who founded our Church and Christ who ensured its holiness. 

> praying to those demons instead of God

The saints are not demons, maybe you should read your Bible, attributing the work of the spirit to demons is a VERY serious sin. They are holy people filled with the holy spirit, have some respect.
