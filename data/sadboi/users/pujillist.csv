MakeupAddicts,ffuawyv,t3_ev7sw5,1580238141.0,I have super dry skin & use the rose gold oil from Farsali. It’s literally an oil so it’s super moisturizing & my skin just sucks it up. I’ve also tried to limit the amount of times I wash my face in the day to two & use a natural toner when I am feeling grimey or dry. I think it’s helping!

BingeEatingDisorder,eqr0a7a,t3_bz25cq,1560240938.0,"I was diagnosed with IC about ten years ago & have suffered from flare ups on & off since then. I have not attempted the elimination diet as of yet, but I just wanted to reach out & let you know that you have someone who can relate to your struggle with this pretty obscure diagnosis. I have never heard of anyone other than my old doctor even mention IC, so I felt compelled to reach out. You can do this!! You are bigger than any mountain put in front of you. 💕"
