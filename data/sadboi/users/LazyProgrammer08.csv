depression,f923cdn,t3_e36ib4,1575010787.0,"To be fair, meds are actually just as much of a gamble as telling someone that life is worth living. Because depression can affect everyone in a very different way there isn't a way to treat everyone with a generalized drug, meds will have a different affect on different people, and for some it either won't work or it'll make their depression worse. So I feel like the only thing that you can do for someone is to just be patient with them and be there for them in a genuine way, and not just as a skin deep ""look at me, I'm helping people"" way.

Life is only worth living if you can find something that's worth living for, on its own, it's boring and has no substance other than a bunch of requirements that need to be met in order to keep living to keep meeting those requirements, like breathing, eating, drinking, etc. So nothing exciting or even fulfilling can happen without us making something like that possible.

I agree with you that people that are just there to say stupid and generic shit about not doing it or about life being worth living or even ""think about your family"", that last one gets me because if I or anyone else decides to do it, then why would it matter what anyone thinks because I or someone else won't be there anymore, so our reality stops and nothing matters to us anymore.

Before I sound like I'm advocating that everyone should just do it, I'm not, but I'm also not going to ever force someone to be around any longer than they want to be. But I would like to say that in my own experience, the only way that I've been able to in any sense overcome the overwhelmingly strong feelings of literally just throwing myself into a massive car accident or off of a tall building, is by trying to find any small glimpse of happiness in anything that I've found enjoyable (like a game or a YouTube video, or even in some songs) and using that to maybe (if and when I feel like it) to find a way to do or get actively closer to the things that I'm passionate about, in my case it's programming and basically any tech.

I do know that some of you might not feel passionate about anything other than the intense feelings of self hatred and sadness, or even anger, and I get it, I've been there to, I've felt so angry at the world for being the way that it is, that I wanted to leave it and never come back, I've felt so heartbroken and dissapointed in myself because of all the things that I've badly messed up just purely because of the person that I am and was at those points, it's not easy and so there is never going to be an easy answer and to be honest, you can't save everyone, even though I personally wish that I could save every single one of you and help build a better world for all of you and for all of us living on this planet, so that we wouldn't have so many reasons to want to die. Because even though life has a crap ton of horrible things in it, it does still have intense potential, and yes the people at the top do little to nothing to make this world a better place, but if it were different, if we could make it different and if we could aggressively fight back the disgusting things that people put out into the world then I honestly feel like we would all be able to find a reason to live for, or at least we'd be happier about being alive in general.

Ultimately the choice is always in your hands and it always will be, but if you can in any way find something that you enjoy and that even in the smallest sense makes you happy, then I beg you to please grab onto it and take it for everything it has to offer you u til you can pull yourself far enough out of everything you're feeling and then make the choice, and know that whatever it is, it's truly what you want.

If this helps even one person to just take a step back or even just pause for a second and think twice, then I hope that you can try and do the same for someone else. Just be there, especially if you know or have known what it's like."

But if your family does listen to you and helps you out then there's always the chance that you feel like some kind of failure as a result of not being able to cope in the real world. I think kids should grow up knowing the truth, it doesn't have to be the cold truth, but it needs to be true enough for them to realize that it isn't easy, but it also doesn't have to be an immovable mountain either, you have to teach your kids to find happiness in the challenges, or at least find a way to keep an eye on the end goal while going through the lows."
