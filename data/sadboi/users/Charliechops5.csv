You aren't a buzzkill. Anxiety is crappy and causes us to cope in anyway we find helps, unfortunately self harm comes into this. You are more than welcome to send me a PM if you fancy a chat, I'm not a qualified professional, but any support is better than none :)"

It's very hard to stop and I can't imagine your struggle, please don't put yourself in harms way, and get some help.
