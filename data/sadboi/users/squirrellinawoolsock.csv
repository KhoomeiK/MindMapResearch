TooAfraidToAsk,fr5hcem,t1_fr51yr5,1589908576.0,"I definitely don’t disagree with you. There are a ton of barriers that go into people’s decisions to not touch the foster system. 

I definitely agree that some foster children come with a lot of baggage. However, while it is difficult to foster a baby because everyone wants those, it is possible. Furthermore, with fostering and adoption, I’ve heard a lot of people say “but what if it has (insert whatever name here) disease?!” My response to that one is: what if your bio kid does? I have a cousin whose daughter had a rare form of Hurlers Disease and she died at 3 after having a very rough life from the start. Mental health concerns? You could have to pay for a ton of therapy for your biological kid too. Lots of my family members have schizophrenia, depression, severe anxiety, autism, I’m bipolar and so is my mom (hence the reason I won’t reproduce among other things that a child would be genetically predisposed to if I decided to create one)... Creating a new person is a wild card. 

Yes, it is possible that the parents can gain custody of the children before you’re able to adopt, and I totally understand that’s heartbreaking for people who become attached to the children. It is rough, and I can understand people not wanting to foster based on that alone. However, on the flip side— I know a few people who successfully adopted from fostering (one adopted a baby, another adopted a 5 year old) and I’ve had a few cousins unfortunately go into the foster system who were eventually adopted by wonderful families. Two of my cousins were able to stay together with the same family and were adopted at 3 and 4. Another was adopted at around 13. I’m incredibly grateful to the families who adopted them and provided a better life for them than what some of my sorry ass cousins could. I also know firsthand of a family who fully adopted a boy when he was a baby through traditional adoption and the father fought to gain custody of the boy when he was 4 and won. 

I’m definitely not saying it is an option for everyone. It is rough and comes with a lot more ropes. But it is an affordable option if someone would like to adopt a child but doesn’t necessarily have the financial means for a more traditional adoption. Typically with foster care, the government basically pays for the kid until the kid is yours anyway if I remember correctly so they provide food stamps and Medicaid and stuff for the child’s needs. I could be wrong because I didn’t fact check.

Also, good on your parents for making that decision. That’s amazing and it takes a lot of maturity to be able to make that decision, especially when family isn’t as supportive."
TooAfraidToAsk,fr4xpxe,t1_fr4py7c,1589898856.0,"You can foster to adopt for a LOT less. Just most people don’t want to deal with the foster system. Most people don’t know that you can choose age ranges and say no to kids that you feel aren’t a good fit for your family. 

Also, I 100% agree with OP and I’ll even go further to say that she’s using her child for social media likes. Nothing pisses me off more than people using their children (especially ones who are disabled/have some sort of condition) for internet likes. Fuck those people."
truechildfree,fr2b5lu,t3_gm90sd,1589834269.0,"Going to come at this from a slightly different perspective because I’m married now. But I definitely had the mindset of wanting to stay single and only casually date longterm before I met my husband. I wanted to focus on earning my degree, starting my career, and really just living my life without restrictions set by another person, be it a spouse or a child. I didn’t want a commitment to another person unless it enhanced my life. Most of my relationships were very short term (like 3 months max) so I eventually just stopped making even a dating commitment. They always ended on good terms (except for that one but that’s a whole mess of a story). It was typically because we discovered we didn’t want the same things in life.

So, when I met my husband, I was only interested in being friends with him. I honestly had crashed and hit rock bottom due to undiagnosed mental health problems, had to move 1800 miles back home to live with the parents, no job and the one I’d had lined up fell through. I was in no place for anything besides friendship. He also was in no place for a relationship either. His job takes him away from home for all but like 6 days per month (sometimes 6 days every 6 weeks), he’d just gotten out of a pretty bad marriage, so he was also only looking for friendship. I was 26, he was 29. It evolved because we connected on a much deeper level and we ended up enhancing each other’s lives the way I’d always expected a long term relationship would and should. We dated for two years, were engaged for one, and then we got married last November. I was 29, he was 32. 

So, I had extremely positive experiences being single and childfree and loved the flexibility to go anywhere I wanted whenever I wanted. But I’ve also had extremely positive experiences with my husband but only because our relationship is right for us. We both still get to be independent. We still get to focus on our careers, hobbies, and interests outside of each other. We don’t hold each other back, and instead we ensure that we’re laying the foundation for the future we want and we’ve collaborated to build a great life together. We’re both firmly childfree. We both love kids but don’t want the responsibility. 

Had I not met my husband, I would still be happily single and childfree, working on my career, traveling,  and taking life as it comes. I’d definitely suggest staying single unless and until you meet someone who makes it 110% worth it to not be."

Literally the morning she passed, I was standing by her bed (hospice, in her bedroom) and my mom and sister were in there as well and my mom said, “you might not have accepted the church in this lifetime but we’re getting your work done ASAP” and my sister said “yep, already set the calendar date a year from now”. I was so angry because I felt like it went against her wishes. And I doubt they’ve mentioned it to my dad (baptized to shut my mom up, super inactive, spiritual but not religious).

Considering he and I would spend that much in the week that he was home (if not more) every month, the fact that it’s now my monthly budget AND covers our food when he’s home really makes a huge difference and has left us money to spend for other things we want.

I called my mom to tell her and to get reassurance and she told me that was my “ministering sister” from the church. I asked how they even knew where I lived because that made me even more anxious and she told me she’d given them my address.

Also, my mom doesn’t even live here. She lives an hour away. Mormons have this creepy-ass network and I constantly feel like I can’t get away from them and from experiences like this.

AmItheAsshole,fptkl94,t3_gf6x2a,1588892998.0,"NTA and actually, he’s wrong. Yes, you should prioritize your child’s needs. But you and your relationship are a higher priority. 

If you’re on a plane, they always say to put your oxygen mask on before you put on your child’s. Why? Because if you’re not alert, you can’t help your child. You have to take care of yourself in order to be able to take care of your child, otherwise you’re all fucked.

From another perspective: if your relationship isn’t stable, it’s not providing the stability you need for your child and your child suffers the consequences. If your mood isn’t stable, your child suffers the consequences.

Your child is here BECAUSE your relationship existed first. Your relationship doesn’t exist because of the child. And if you prioritize the child and neglect your relationship or yourself, the child is actually NOT being prioritized because children need stability and your priority is making sure they have that.

Your SO needs to grow the fuck up because he’s acting like a child himself.

Also, if he’s not taking care of your needs now, like so many others have said, you should re-evaluate your relationship with him."

Do you have any hobbies or interests? Anything you can possibly do as a group to meet new friends that can kind of help take your mind off of it? What worked for me was forming relationships with people who I had common interests with. For me, the relationship with other people is most important so, while it sucked to it have a SO, I at least had love and support from people I cared about and we could always go do something together. 

I truly hope you find a solution because I totally understand being trapped in an area where everyone is so family-focused. I even currently am and my husband is rarely home. I actually ended up getting along super well with our next door neighbors so we hang out when my husband isn’t home. They even have a 2 year old son. I also have a couple of CF best guy friends who are awesome as well. So, when my husband isn’t home, I miss him and nobody can take his place, but I still have people to kind of curb that a bit.

When I was traveling to Ireland, I ended up hanging out with a family during our two days of flight delays who’d traveled from Nashville to New Orleans on their trip. It was their third one over and they decided to see the country a few snippets at a time so they could fully enjoy the experience. But I completely understand where you’re coming from.

Try independent study for graphic design. You can do online courses for as low as $50 or find some pretty awesome ones for a few hundred. Hell, there are even FREE resources to follow along with to help familiarize yourself. So, not getting into a university or being able to pay for it is no excuse. Get a side hustle to earn more money if needed. 

Your portfolio matters more than a degree in graphic design. You can create a bomb ass portfolio and send it to several print shops, advertising agencies, etc. Don’t be afraid to take a shit job at a super small startup to gain experience to learn and grow and move on to better. I did it. I worked at a concrete company doing super small time marketing for a while before I finally was hired on at the second largest ad agency in the world. 

I’m not here to give you the attention you want. I’m giving you solutions to the problem at hand and information that you can do whatever you want to with. 

I get it. Life sucks. I had my dreams crushed while i was in college. I was raped in my freshman year and lost all of my scholarships I’d worked my ass off to get. I failed every class that semester and was forced to take a year off for something that wasn’t even my fault. I was lucky my family was poor I suppose so i was able to get financial aid/student loans. But i was under financial probation and HAD to get my GPA up from a 1.1 to a 2.5 within a year to maintain the ability to receive aid. I didn’t. I was forced to take more time from college and save up to pay cash for another semester to get my grades over 2.5 and then I had to appeal to the financial aid department to get the ability to qualify for student loans again. Then, because my family was poor, i ended up working full time through a year of college to help support them. It drained ALL of my savings that I’d put back for study abroad. Crossed that hurdle. Saved more money up so I could move out of state and start a better career when I graduated. Except, a week before graduation, my family needed help again. So I stayed. Took a job I hated that at least gave me experience. Had zero savings and $300 in my pocket when I was FINALLY able to move out of state and get a better job.

Take the time to really explore the city/surrounding areas. If you’re into the outdoors, find some hidden gems, a trail or two. Find some local haunts to dive into when you don’t want to be at home/where you can potentially make friends. Whether you’re a reader or not, libraries usually have a variety of programs and events where you can meet other people and pursue interests. There are also community centers. 

Personally, I’m a city girl who loves the outdoors, so downtown SLC was pretty much perfect. I had two small trails within 5-10 minutes of my apartment. Dozens within 30 minutes (along with a few ski resorts). And hundreds within an hour. When I wasn’t in the mountains, I was walking around downtown. There were several restaurants, coffee shops, and bars that I’d meet up with friends at. Even without friends, I found places that I lived the atmosphere and would just go grab a snack or a drink and enjoy my own company.

As far as missing family and friends, that’s the difficult part. Luckily, we live in the age of FaceTime (or whatever other video chat you use). Part of my motivation to move back to Louisiana was because I was using all of my PTO to visit home instead of to go to other places I wanted to travel. In hindsight, I should have visited home every 6 months and taken another trip every 6 months. Instead, I visited home every 3 months. I also flew my family up to stay with me which was pretty fun for everyone. Having friends who became close like family there really helped to lessen the homesickness. 

All in all, it was probably the most empowering experience I’ve ever had and I’m definitely better for it. It boosted my confidence exponentially. I was pretty independent and confident before I moved, but when I realized I was making it 1800 miles from home and everything I’d known, I knew I could do pretty anything. 

The experience is what you can make of it. And I highly suggest exploring ASAP and finding your niche. Use Meetups to find people with similar interests. Best of luck!"

TheMonkeysPaw,fov4qyn,t1_fov0f8p,1588095359.0,"Yesss i feel that on such a deep level. I probably worded my previous comment wrong on that point. Because I meant exactly what you just said. Like, it sucks for everyone right now, but those of us whose brains were already a whole mess and a half are struggling a bit more. Because we already struggle under normal circumstances. 

What’s worse is when you’re questioning whether your medications are actually working or not. Like, I had to message my doctor and ask if it was normal that I was rapid cycling again since I’d gotten stable and he told me to wait it out a couple of weeks to make sure it’s not just all the external factors. So I did. Turns out it was just all the uncertainty because I’m balanced again. But it’s mental hell right now. Especially when you’re questioning yourself."
TheMonkeysPaw,fouzzao,t1_fouz4ry,1588093149.0,"Yeah it’s been rough as hell. I’d finally found a medication that was working for me. Sent home to isolate. Threw my mood into a shitshow of rapid cycling which was a total shock considering I’d JUST balanced out. Luckily, I’m able to work from home so it’s helped keep me in a routine. And my moods have stabilized again so I’m somewhere between pretty stable or hypomanic. My meds treat the depression more than the mania.

I hope things start looking up for you soon. It’s rough as hell out there right now and is taking a huge psychological toll on a lot of people, especially those of us with preexisting mental health conditions. Take care, it’s more important now than ever."

Anyway, when people ask what I’d like, I let them know anything is fine as long as there is a gluten free option. And I also let them know that they are in no way obligated to provide a meal for me because I can easily bring my own or pick something up to prepare with them. People have been very understanding and have been kind enough to ensure I can have at least a decent meal from options provided, or that we go to a restaurant with plenty of gluten free options. And I appreciate it very much. But I do always makes sure that my diet is not their responsibility to cater to. All I ask is for a heads up if there will be no gluten free options so I’ll know to eat beforehand.

OP is NTA. If someone with severe food intolerances can be responsible for their own food and not expect everyone to cater to them, someone with an aversion to  certain foods should be able to do the same."

Furthermore, I would NEVER copy the CEO on ANY email I send unless I was directly asking him something. That’s asking for trouble.

unpopularopinion,fo20p15,t1_fo1zl3d,1587446273.0,"I totally agree. I understand why people want to celebrate their wedding day. But spending that much money? No. I know people who have had nice weddings for as little as $2500. Some friends of mine have a $6000 budget for theirs. I think their parents are pitching in a bit also. 

When my husband and I were planning a wedding, we were figuring between $6000-$10000. We ended up looking at even those numbers and deciding it wasn’t worth it because neither of us actually wanted the wedding anyway lol. Pretty glad too, that was going to be on April 4th of this year so I’m pretty glad we didn’t have to change all that last minute. We got married in November instead for $40 and spent like $120 on dinner and drinks after. So $160 total and we loved the way we did it. But again, neither of us wanted a wedding to begin with. We haven’t had our honeymoon yet because we’re working on financial stability more first and ensuring we have the funds to go all out on it.

I think our original budget was reasonable, especially without receiving help from anyone else. But we’re also 29 and 33 with well-paying, stable careers. So we have the stability to reasonably afford it. 

The couple I know with the $6000 budget is 22, she’s a stay at home mom, and he works multiple jobs and is trying to figure out how they’re going to afford it. I’m legit concerned because I know it’ll be a huge disappointment for them if they have to cut expenses and not get the wedding they want. They’re already having to move it back a few months because of current circumstances. 

And then there’s the ones who could’ve bought brand new trucks with the amount it cost them to have a wedding... Especially because some of them didn’t have houses before they got married and now homeownership isn’t realistic for them for a while because they’re in so much debt and they’re miserable because of it. They all say if they had it to do again, they would’ve had a much smaller wedding or eloped."

Spending a few grand, I can totally see. But some people spend so much money on their first wedding that they’re still paying it off during their second marriage."

I wouldn’t want to drag a child through every mania-induced whim I have, or have them feel the repercussions if I accidentally spend way too much money.

Also, my mom was undiagnosed bipolar for my childhood and it definitely was not fun. Considering I still go through mood cycles, I’d probably be the parent that gets overwhelmed and then my grumpiness would be tenfold, my depression would be tenfold, bipolar rage is a thing, and I definitely remember all the nights my mom wanted us to help her clean until 2-3 am even though we were tired. 

It took a lot of growing and understanding that my mom wasn’t meaning to be so extreme, she was just unmedicated for a severe mental health disorder. But, even medicated, you’re never fully stable. Like, my medication finally had me fully balanced and then isolation threw me right back off balance to the point I had to call my doctor to make sure it hadn’t stopped working suddenly and to get validation that it was normal to experiencing such deep mood shifts. 

My 6yo nephew stayed with me for the past week, and he’s a great kid so it was pretty easy. But he’s also pretty independent and can poop on his own so the biggest issue we had the entire time was when he ugly-cried about having to eat mashed potatoes lol. But even he has pushed my buttons to the point that I’ve had to go to another room to calm down. And I typically only keep him for a day or two at a time.

Because they’re pretty gross too. I don’t do well with bodily fluids. Like, I vomit when my dog vomits. I’m also bipolar and finally found meds that work for me and literally nobody (including myself) wants me to come off the meds for any reason unless they stop working and I need to find a new combination. So, like you, if I ever wanted kids, I’d prefer to foster/adopt and I’d go with a kid who knows how to potty (or is at least of the age to learn). But my husband doesn’t want to do that because he’s afraid he wouldn’t feel the same. He’s more of a fence sitter, leaning toward childfree the older we get.

Or a student living at home (even if they’re a bit older and getting a master’s degree), again, as long as they’re contributing. Basically, be an adult and more like a roommate if you’re living with your parents and older.

The problem is, I know 28 year olds, like my friend, who are still spoon fed. I know 32 year olds who have children and are still spoon fed. I know 29 year olds who have literally never held a job and stay home and play video games constantly (true story, promise) because they “don’t have motivation yet”. I know so many people in their late twenties/early thirties who don’t know how to function or really just don’t want to. And I was drawing from that personal experience when I commented last night.

I have noticed that the people in my life who haven’t done much of anything to make themselves more attractive candidates and who whine about the way their lives are, are definitely the ones who were (and still are) spoon fed by their parents. One of them has been given a house, several cars, family still buys groceries for them, and so on. But because they’re having to do Waitr for money and aren’t able to get a job making very much per hour, they whine constantly about how much their life sucks and they don’t have money. This person is single, nearly 30, nobody to support and still receives support from parents and grandparents. They also refused to do any type of education or certification after high school. Like, wtf do you think you’re going to get unless you want to do manual labor (which they refuse to do)? Even that sometimes requires a certification of some sort. 

Meanwhile, my sister, who is the same age, is a single mom, receives no support from kiddo’s father. Lives with my parents but helps them with bills and groceries. Bought her own car, pays her own bills, and is currently saving for a down payment on a house and is on track to buy in a couple of years if all goes well. She has moved into a supervisory position in less than a year at her job and is planning to work her way through nursing school within the next 5 years or so. She also never whines or complains about how her life sucks. She just works to make it better, even if she’s never wealthy.

The example that came to mind was the handful of people that I personally know who actually haven’t done anything to develop their skills or themselves but constantly whine about lack of opportunities.
