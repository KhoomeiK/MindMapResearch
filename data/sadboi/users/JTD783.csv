Shareef O‚ÄôNeil, who has recently put his name in the transfer portal or whatever it‚Äôs called for college basketball, had yet to decide where he‚Äôd go after leaving UCLA.  His family, given that his dad is Shaq, and the Bryant family were very close, to the point that Kobe was like a second uncle to him.

Around 8:00 that morning, Kobe texted Shareef and asked him how he was doing, and checked in to make sure he wasn‚Äôt having any problems during the confusing/stressful time in his life.  Shareef responded around 10 am by assuring his wellbeing and thanked Kobe, then asked Kobe how he was doing.

Kobe was never able to respond.  The helicopter crashed about an hour later.

Shareef posted their exchange on twitter the next day.  He was crushed, heartbroken.  It‚Äôs very clear how much supportive male figures can make a difference in someone‚Äôs life.  Shareef was lucky to have him in his life while he did."

btd6,fpufbtr,t3_gflmcu,1588911480.0,"Assuming you have maximum monkey knowledge:

1. Play in easy mode.  Everything is less expensive.

2. Use Ezili.  Her level 20 ability kills any BAD regardless of HP.  All MOAB-class Bloons scale in HP in free play.

3. Gradually add defenses.  Ninja + Alchemist is almost always a good combo.

4. Spam farms.  I think the most efficient way to farm, for most maps, is spamming 2-3-0 farms and rushing 2-5-0.

5. Get an Energizer.  Makes abilities, like the 2-5-0 farm, recharge faster.

6. Get even more farms.  Fill the whole screen with banks, or get a 5-2-0 farm and surround it with 4-2-0 farms.  As long as your defenses are good just keep farming. 

Steps 7 through 12 should all be done at the same time, in between rounds.  With enough farming this can be done before round 100.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

7. Get a 4-2-0 Super Monkey.  The optimal sacrifices are $50,000 worth of primary, magic, and military each.  So $150K sacrifices plus $85K to go from 3-2-0 to 4-2-0.  Farming is important.  Make sure it‚Äôs in the middle of the map.

8. Get a Vengeful Temple.  This is done by sacrificing another $50K worth of each category: primary, military, magic, and support.  Outside of the 4-2-0 temple‚Äôs range, place a x-5-x and x-x-5 Super Monkey.  Sacrifice them and you will have the Vengeful Temple.

9. Place a Permabrew (5-x-x) alchemist to buff the Vengeful Temple.

10. Place a 2-5-0 village in the vicinity of the Vengeful Temple.

11. Get a x-5-x Ultraboost engineer.  Buff the VT ten times to get maximum attack speed.

12. Place more 4-2-0 Sun Temples.  Give them the same sacrifices as from step 7.  They should be within range of the VT so they can buff it.  Place as many on the map as possible.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

13.  Get a x-x-5 alchemist.  The Bloon Master Alchemist is arguable the most powerful late-game tower as it OHKOs any non-BAD Bloon regardless of HP and at a faster rate than Ezili‚Äôs ability.

14. Place a few 0-3-2 alchemists.  Unstable Concoctions are extremely powerful against grouped MOAB-class Bloons. 

15. Fill screen with powerful towers.  Most tier 5 towers are good choices, as well as 2-0-4 Dark Champions.  Note that due to being sacrificed to the VT, you cannot get a new Anti Bloon nor a Legend of the Night.  The VT is so much more powerful that it doesn‚Äôt matter.

16. Buff all towers with villages, Permabrew, and Ultraboost.  Use the x-4-x helicopter to move Permabrew around the map.  As long as it doesn‚Äôt get sold, all towers it buffs will remain buffed even if it‚Äôs moved away from them.

17. Constantly activate Homeland Defense and other abilities to make the rounds go by faster.

18. Just keep waiting as the rounds go by.  Eventually your defenses will be overrun as the HP of the MOAB-class Bloons becomes too high to beat.  

This will last you well past round 200.  I don‚Äôt know what the record is for most rounds in free play is as of the latest version (17.1) but you might be able to make it to round 300 before your computer explodes from lag.

Keep in mind that after round 100, all rounds will be randomized.  A round could send you nothing but MOABs and BFBs or it could send over one hundred reinforced BADs.  All that is guaranteed is that their HP will keep scaling higher over time.  Certain rounds, like 101, 163, 263, and every multiple of 100, will still have a set pattern.

Every multiple of round 100 will give you an insta monkey."
