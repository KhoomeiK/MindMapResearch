Atlanta,fhxf1dj,t1_fhwc92z,1581952850.0,"Sam Nunn is currently full on their parking garage space. The nearby pay lots run about $7 at the early bird rate for the day. 

Highly recommend Marta. Getting to work usually takes me 10-15 minutes when I drive from Lindbergh, takes me easily 40 minutes to get home and sometimes much longer depending on accidents.

ETA: My employer also covers the cost of the Marta card."

TwoXChromosomes,fcup5hq,t3_ej0rx2,1577985701.0,"Hey dude. Very similar situation, just gender flipped. I think airing that out might not be the best idea just yet. I would recommend just letting her know up front that you want to take it slow physically/intimately and she shouldn't expect sex to be part of the relationship in the immediate future. Tell her you're okay fooling around in other ways if she would like (and if you're comfortable). If the relationship continues and you've built up considerable trust, then you can consider talking that out with her. 

Not saying that you have PTSD, but r/PTSD has some posts on very similar issues if you ever need some solidarity. You can move past this and have a healthy sexual future. Good on you for establishing boundaries and taking care of yourself."

ptsd,fb3g7l4,t3_eb90xm,1576472213.0,"Hey friend. I also have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and am in the military. I had a breakdown last year and very nearly ended up committed or in IOP. I fought like hell against it for fear of losing my career. Instead I ended up on a temporary profile and started going to behavioral health. My career is ay okay.

ptsd,f7d4xwk,t3_dvibeu,1573607720.0,"Hey hey. 

I identify with a lot that you're saying here, even the lumping into groups. I used to get so strung out over ""if what I remember is already awful, how much worse is what I can't?"" Especially the aspect of someone knowing more about what happened to my body than I do. But honestly, it just doesn't matter. He doesn't matter. I matter. 

It doesn't bother me as much now, but I can't exactly nail down why. My only thoughts are that I'm working on what I do know. The pieces/parts that I remember are enough for me to work with/fix. No need to fix the missing parts, my brain's already done the work there to protect me. 

Hope any of that makes sense?"

Another therapist told me later on that the first one had been wrong. I don't know which one was right, but my lie by omission saved me the legal side of it that I was NOT interested in pursuing. Just food for thought."

I'm a math nerd, and I imagine my life on this nice upward trajectory until the trauma hit, and then the PTSD. 

But over the years I've come to think that maybe I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. It sucks. But I would've changed in other ways regardless. And as others have mentioned, it's helpful for me to find the positives. I know I'm infinitely more compassionate than I would've otherwise grown to be.

Keep pushing OP. Make a new trajectory."

Similar to where you're at, my posts at the time had a ""positive"" spin, so I think that helps readers process more positively.

Only thing I would say is make sure you're in the right headspace after the fact. Several people followed up and asked me questions in person over the next few days, which can be a lot. 

Congrats on meeting this goal for yourself!"
