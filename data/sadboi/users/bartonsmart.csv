Guitar,fpqw31j,t3_gf0yqi,1588833977.0,"This is the dilemma of just intonation. If you stack major thirds according to the pure ratio of 5:4 you won’t achieve a pure octave of 2:1. The discrepancy is called a comma and in equal temperament this distance is dispersed equally between all notes, meaning all ratios are somewhat sacrificed. (except for the octave). An equal tempered major third is sharp compared to its just intoned counterpart. No matter how purely you tune your guitar’s open G chord (emphasizing the pure 5:4 between the B and G strings), when you switch to an open D chord you won’t have a pure perfect fourth between those strings playing D and A respectively."
