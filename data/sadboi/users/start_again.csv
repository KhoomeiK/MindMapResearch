No matter how cluttered or messy your home is you should be able to tidy up a small area or find a wall to use as your background.

Awwducational,fn01ylg,t3_fy7hsv,1586533966.0,"There used to be these clients that would keep bringing their morbidly obese dog into the vet where I worked because he was struggling to get up. When the vet told them it was because their dog was morbidly obese and if they put him on a diet he could get to a healthy weight it would be able to get up easier and even be able to go on walks. They were adamant that something else was wrong with their dog. They insisted on bloodwork and X-rays. In order to rule out any underlying fractures, soft tissue damage, arthritis, metabolic issues, etc. the veterinarian obliged and ran bloodwork and took X-rays. These all came back normal of course. We gave them an actual food measuring scoop and told them how much to give, how often, and to avoid all other snack and treats and monitor so the dog couldn’t get into any other food. Each month they would come back, insisting they were following our instructions, but the dog would weigh more and would have more difficulty getting up. Eventually the dog did develop arthritis, as well as diabetes. The diabetes helped contribute to infection of the skin that was broken down from pressure sores from being obese and unable to get up and walk around for any significant amount of time. Now we all considered this animal abuse, but this isn’t the type of thing that animal services considers to be severe enough to intervene. Eventually they stopped coming because the dog was getting worse and our solution was always the same. Feed. The. Dog. Less. Food. I felt so bad for not only the dog, but the entire family. Especially the children. They were all obese. Each one of them looked so uncomfortable. None of them could even walk the half flight of stairs to get up to the clinic. They always had to pull up to the side entrance. But what can you do? The problem is much bigger than just a fat dog and beyond what a monthly vet trip could provide for intervention.  It was very sad and we all felt so bad for the dog because you could tell he was miserable but just wanted to be a dog and do dog things, like get up and wag his tail to say hi."

ptsd,fm7v5ob,t1_fm7l4pc,1585837428.0,"Maybe what this person is trying to say is one person doesn’t get to define what another person’s trauma is. Your opinion, which of course you are entitled to, implies that OP’s trauma was not sufficient enough to lead to PTSD, which is the exact attitude that prevents many people with a PTSD diagnosis from admitting to and/or being treated for their disorder. It’s because they don’t feel entitled to help, which is a common symptom of PTSD in and of itself and is only reinforced by statements like the one you made. You know, like you can’t have PTSD unless you’ve fought in a war. You didn’t say it like that but it came across the same way. The facts are that what OP is describing sounds like acute stress disorder (ASD), which is the body’s physical and emotional response to an initial traumatic event. There are a variety of signs and symptoms and if they don’t subside within a month and still of causing distress in a person’s life then ASD is no longer acute and is reclassified as PTSD. Obviously a cheating boyfriend does not compare to say combat in Vietnam but try to think of PTSD as a spectrum. And yes, maybe OP can eventually ‘get over it’ but it would more than likely just be a form of remission. I bet if they ever got cheated on again by their current SO or somebody else in the future it would take them right back to where they are right now and all the same feelings and physiological symptoms would come flooding right back like time had not passed at all."

He will not engage with us, is difficult to work with in group projects, and resistant to anything we have to say that can be perceived as criticism. For example, if we gently talk to him about how it is inappropriate to chart using words like 'diaper' when referring to an adult, he will argue that it is not insensitive because it is just semantics. He has had multiple complaints from the nurses he has worked with as well as his patients. Yet he is unable or unwilling to alter his approach. To top it off he told my preceptor that none of like him because he is ""smarter than the rest of us"". He is not the highest scorer on the exams, so this is not true. He will not initiate contact with us, even though all of us have tried to incorporate him into the things we do.

I’d made a shit ton of upgrades, starting with burning it down and building it back up again. Then I’d join forces with the nursing school one block away and make it a teaching nursing home. But first and foremost I’d give every CNA a fat raise and work the floor with them and give those poor residents a much better life than they have now. There had to be a better way we are managing our long term care in the U.S. It’s pathetic as of now. I’d make an amazing philanthropist. Just give me a chance."

For pain that has been around for 25 years. “Sounds like tension,” she said. I don’t want to appear like I’m doctor shopping so now I’m on Wellbutrin. I am more focused and have less of an appetite, but still in pain. I don’t know what else to do."
