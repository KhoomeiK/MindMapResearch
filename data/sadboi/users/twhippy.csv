The good days do feel like I'm welcoming home someone who has been away for so long. Just like that long lost friend they always leave too soon."
crafting,evj851j,t3_ck3syw,1564557308.0,"So you have what we cup resiners (a word I made up) like to call fish eyes. Little gaping holes in your resin. Essentially something in or on the canvas disagrees with the resin and repels it. 
The easiest way to deal with this is to apply a shiny or matte spray on polyurethane top coat (though I'd stick to shiny if you want your panting to massively shine), and once it dries apply your resin. 
Other options include lightly misting with rubbing alcohol, but that could damage your painting. Many times it's oils in paints preventing the resin from sticking. 
I hope that helps."
