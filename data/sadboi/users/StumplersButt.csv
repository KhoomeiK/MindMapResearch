OK, I'm going to try not to get angry, but words have meanings. I was raped: Someone broke into my house and threatened to kill me by suffocation if I did not quietly allow him to force his d*** into me.

Worse, I spent ten minutes being raped while thinking the next step was being murdered.

This person GAVE CONSENT. The person having sex with them had NO IDEA that anyone might possibly consider this rape, because there was mutual consent. My rapist deliberately and maliciously caused me a great deal of harm.

Not only are you putting the idea into people's heads that something as horribly traumatizing as RAPE has happened to them when it HAS NOT--which is very bad for them, mentally and emotionally; how are they going to process it when something terrible DOES happen?--but you are also belittling my experience, and diluting the meaning of the word. Now, thanks to people stretching ""rape"" to cover every mildly regretful thing they've ever CHOSEN to do, when I tell people I've been raped and need mental health help, they think, ""Oh, well, maybe she just had drunken sex she regrets; I'll save that free therapy for someone with real problems."" I feel sorry for this person, but they were NOT RAPED and it is incredibly responsible for anyone to mess with the meaning of a word that is so charged and important.
