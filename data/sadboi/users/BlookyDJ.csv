There are 4 different campaigns, Leon, Chris, Jake, and Ada, i found out originally ada was not cooperative, but an update was released to allow coop by allowing P2 to play as an Agent, basically, he doesn't exist within the story, it just allows cooperative play. RE6 also has online play and sometimes you can even get 4 Players too, only online and at specific chapters. RE6 Also has gamemodes like agent hunt, in agent hunt you play as a zombie/enemy and try to kill the player. Then there's the mercenaries, a gamemode where you fight for survival until time runs out."
