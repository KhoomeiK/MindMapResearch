In regards to sources, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but I've read many articles regarding that issue. And to a lesser extent, I've known a couple parents who made their kids dress as the opposite gender, despite them not wanting to. 

Personally, I never brought up gender as a kid, because my parents were VERY strict with me, very emotionally manipulative and abusive. So despite me feeling depressed and often suicidal with them forcing me into things I didn't want to, I learned to just do as they say so they'd love me. 

The point of me bringing that up though is that kids WILL do what their parents tell them if they feel it'll make them be nicer to them. They're easy to manipulate. Maybe not all of them, plenty of kids WILL resist that shit, but many go along because they want to be safe, mentally or physically."

I've heard so many cases where minors got on hormones pretty damn easily and then soon realized they weren't trans, and then of course it was too late at that point. Even with ADULTS, I have a family member who has a LOT of mental issues, but she had the same issue: Got on hormones with ease and then regretted it, realizing they weren't trans. And that's kinda why I argue for having an age limit. Because even adults can screw themselves over with it, so feeble-minded, indecisive children would be even worse with it...

I'm an atheist, but I can still offer advice/support. I've read the Bible front to back many times, and there is NOTHING about watching porn or jacking off. Yes it says stay away from fleshly desires of whatever, but every desire is a ""fleshly"" one. Craving sugar? That's a fleshly desire. Want a glass of wine? That's a fleshly desire. But Jesus drank wine, and even turned water into it. So, I don't care what the religious leaders say, touching yourself isn't wrong according to the Bible. It's not fornication, and it's not a sin. And if God didn't want people touching themselves, why'd he make the clitoris? You can argue that's for sex, but it is 0% needed for baby making, which religion often says is the only reason for sex. So obviously, God doesn't care if you pleasure yourself now and then. So don't feel bad just because you like feeling good.
