dating_advice,faao6xz,t1_faan884,1575911384.0,More on this right my friend currently has a girlfriend and I know they have been texting since I introduced them. Right before this I was in the middle of a situation where his girlfriend found out he cheated on her.(with his ex)  Alot of drama came into my life and low key I feel this is going to happen again. The girl still hits me up now and then but I feel like I am getting myself involved in another situation. I am only asking this cause she texted me 2 days ago asking me if I have been avoiding her.

depression,eoh1m4w,t3_brsy1y,1558570730.0,I am back in college after a year off. I tell myself every morning not today and there are still days when I just skip class to take a break. You have to appreciate the fact that you are trying to be better.
