civically oriented. 

I’m sure your chapter (if you have a chapter) could use this for printing literature, holding meetings, and your general smash the fash’ stuff but if you want to do some real good in your community, maybe use that money to help the less fortunate. Do stuff out of the box of what’s already being done. Maybe buy a large amount of mensural products and hand them out to the street involved folks who need them. Donate money to trans groups that supply binders and gaffs to those who can’t pay for them traditionally. Find some immigrant based community centres that help families get settled in their new country. 

Also after you’ve donated your money, consider doing the same thing with your time. The most important thing is to protect vulnerable communities and you can always do that but spending a few hours a week (or many of your so inclined) giving them a hand in ways they need. Two awesome things happen. You feel good for doing your part and they feel like their community is embracing them despite their differences."

polyamory,fmznxj9,t3_fyc1ic,1586525654.0,"This is particularly relevant to me so i’ll touch on this.

I’m worry but your partner does not care about how this is making you feel and he is indeed cheating on you. You’ve expressed to him many times at this point that this person gives you bad vibes (when a partner tells me this about a new love interest I tend to take this to heart. They care about me any may see things I don’t see.) and he chose not to listen and be friends with this person anyways, ok but not great. 

The best huge red flag is seeing him use D/S terms with her while he has maintained that their friendship is platonic. This is a big deal. D/S relationships are a big deal. I know if my dom or sub was using these terms with someone without mentioning to me that they were entering a new dynamic it would hurt me a lot. It’s another sign that he didn’t account for your feelings in his actions.

The most egregious and final nail in the coffin is the “I love you’s”. This man fell in love with another person behind your back. You told him about how dating this person gave you bad vibes and you were right. He cheated on you. He lied to you every step of the way and left you to piece it together on your own. 

I’m sorry but your partner is being very irresponsible with your heart and his behaviour is an indication that he doesn’t much care about how that makes you feel. If you were my friend I’d caution you to look at the patterns of behaviour and the willful lying before continuing a relationship with this person."

polyamory,fm7qysa,t3_ftljd0,1585834842.0,"i feel like some of the responses you are getting here are overly critical of you and how you’re conducting your relationship. here’s my two cents:

think about how you’re feeling extensively, what you want, what you need, where you see your future, how you want to spend the rest of your life. if you need to keep posting while you’re going through this journey then do it because resources and support are good. you really need to figure out if you’re having a little bit of a poly existential crisis (we all have them) or your just not built for the lifestyle and this time spent was some needed exploration on a curiosity. 

the thing i urge you to do is take your time and think. don’t make any rash decisions and hurt your partner. my past relationship my partner did little to no work on her jealousy and it ended up eating the relationship. she ended up hanging on too long to her feelings and ended up breaking major relationship boundaries because she felt slighted from all the time she spent jealous and hurt. that’s the thing though, you’re girlfriend isn’t hurting you, she’s just living her life in the honest way she was when you met her. if you are not working on your feelings or are staying in this even though it’s not right for you then i’m sorry but you are hurting yourself. there are lots or resources when it comes to unpacking jealousy. it’s an emotion that every poly person is familiar with but we regularly challenge with logic. it’s possible to get on the other side of how you’re feeling if you’re willing to take a look at yourself and change. 

just take your time, pal. don’t do things out of hurt. don’t wait till your pain gets too much and you do something you’ll regret. work on this stuff every day if you want to be poly, and if you don’t, then be honest with your partner and let them continue living their life.

Indigenous people are done with how Canadians treat them. We act in this country as if racism doesn’t exist but here are some facts:

•Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to go murdered or missing in Canada. Often these women go missing near natural resource projects like CGL because of the transient male
workers who are posted near indigenous populations. The police are more willing to let these cases go cold because of the sheer volume and again, racism.

•Residential schools were ran into the 90’s where indigenous youth were removed from their homes, taught english and forbidden to speak their languages, beaten, in more than a few cases sexually assaulted by religious school staff, estranged from their culture and community, and taught a deep self hatred from all the reconditioning. These schools took language away from many of my people and language is how a culture exists. Many of my friends and family have first or second hand trauma because of these schools.

•Indigenous adults account for 30% of Canada’s prisoners while only making up 4% of Canada’s population.

Well, it's months later now and he has done 13 going on 14 interviews, all with basically the exact same questions, and seeming less and less genuine as time goes on. The last few interviews were basically background characters in this whole debacle giving very little new information and spending most of the time on stream participating in conjecture. Now with this new information regarding Vincent and his wholesale unprofessionalism is making me think this this whole think is kind of a farce. I am starting to believe that Chris isn't really in contact with the FBI and this whole ""investigation"" is basically just a ploy to string along everyone that wants to see some justice for for Greg's victims.

The country is systematically killing off the poor with restricted access to healthcare, poisoning the environment in places like Flint, and rounding up POC and poor people to throw them in jail because they resort to the “illegal” economy when the “legitimate” one has failed them.

polyamory,eux1r63,t1_euwhjae,1564082230.0,"Very. I feel like OP is being a little gatekeepy and not really understanding of how others like to conduct their polyamory. For instance, I don’t advertise that I’m queer on my profile sometimes because I really don’t have to but you bet I let people know when we’re messaging. Withholding information until you know you’re in a safe presence is valid as long as you’re forthright before things progress off the app."

I think you’re mixing up morality with preference here."
