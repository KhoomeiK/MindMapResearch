“Z” tools are widely recommended in forums etc and in the lower/mid price range. 
But, agree w first poster - I’ve been using a pretty cheap one for more than 3-4 years and it’s still the first thing I reach for. 
Seems like buying a great crosscut gets you better rips than vice versa.

The solution I haven’t tried yet is to use wood glue to glue wood shavings (like from a wood plane) to the leg joint to build it back up. Then glue it back into the joint with the wood glue working because no longer gaps or need to span. 
Makes intuitive sense to me after trying/failing with many of the solutions mentioned.

solar,fkss651,t1_fksqxd5,1584497144.0,"Apples and oranges. Buying vs energy contact. I’m saying in most markets you would pay $0.09kwh for your power with a monthly obligation (vs your $0.12kwh rate). FPL is offering you the same deal for $0.14kwh because there is no one competing with them. No one is competing with them because they lobbied to have no one compete against them. 
Buying a system is different. You are right at about a 6 year payback period at $0.12kwh rate. Over a 25 year period should equal a tidy 10%-20% IRR. 
But FPL is keeping anyone but themselves from offering non-purchased solar systems. And charging more for it than current rates (when the solar generated power costs less than their own fossil generation). 
It’s win-win-win for the utility and all loss for the consumer. 

It could be so much better and FL could be a vibrant solar market. But this is how utilities keep competition out by smoke-screening their PUCs."

I may crib either from this but am currently leaning towards an over/under haunched tenon (pinning it was a dowel or drawbore to avoid glue where the rail meets head and footboard to enable disassembly).

But, maybe if I put the side rail haunch on the bottom (and pinned w/ dowel) that would do it. Liking this the best so far, especially since the rails are \~5"" still have some room for healthy tenon.
