To be honest, it's one of the most helpful things I've ever done - taking shrooms. It helped me to accept my psychosis and see the situation as not so scary and intimidating. I get major paranoia if I even think I'm slipping into psychosis, but experiencing psychedelics helped to reassure me that it wasn't this terrifying loss of control."

BPD,fpea263,t3_gcy79e,1588543370.0,"Hiya! I don't know where you're from so it might be different, but I can give you an overview of my assessment experience in the UK. I've had a few and in different settings so hopefully some aspects will be the same for you

You go to your appointment and there will usually be very little small talk. The assessor will either have a computer or a printed form with prompts. It's likely that the assessor knows these prompts very well and has carried out assessments before, so they're usually open to, and quick to answer, any questions. 

There is an order to the questions but you can ask to come back to certain topics or jump to another topic if it's particularly fresh in your memory. The emphasis your be on the accuracy of your account, not the process. 

Topics include your childhood, living arrangements, past trauma or abuse, history of mental illness in your family, recent notable events in your life, your mood and how you react to situations, self-harm and suicide attempts, violent thoughts or intent towards others etc. 

When you answer the questions, you will need to be very clear and specific and will often be prompted to explain your answers if they are unclear. A personal tip: don't worry about using euphemisms if it makes it easier to explain something.

Two out of three of my times I've had someone of the same sex and they've given me some insight into their professional opinion immediately after the assessment. This doesn't necessarily translate into a diagnosis but it's a good indicator. Since you're in such an intimate conversation already, absolutely take the chance to ask any questions you want to about what happens next. 

I hope that helps!"

AskReddit,es1lmsx,t3_c59kyp,1561499692.0,"You might hear that ""surrounding yourself with good people"" is the best at to build confidence but it's not always easy to find people. If that's the case, it's really important that you look at the people who influence you. For my generation and younger (millennial), the people that influence me are online e.g. YouTubers or celebrities. 

There are so many people on YouTube who ooze confidence and care about themselves in a positive and healthy way. Watching those people can start to train your subconscious to become more self-confident and love your mind and your body. It's the same with celebrities. If you find it difficult to surround yourself with friends or family who inspire confidence in a healthy way, tailor your online influencers to do that."

AskReddit,er0i85c,t3_bzxm1q,1560417326.0,"Visited Disneyworld when I was younger with my family. None of us had been before. We went on Space Mountain for the first time and loved it, so we bought fastpass tickets to get on a second time. At the beginning of the ride, it pulls you up a short incline and holds you there. There are two parallel tracks, so it holds one track while the other goes first. We knew this, so were just chatting while waiting for our coaster to start moving. I remember thinking, this isn't right, we should have gone by now. But the second track kept moving. After a while, no coasters were coming up the second track. Another 10 minutes and the lights turned on. (Space Mountain is completely in the dark with LED lights and tunnels.) There were no ride attendants anywhere and at this point my whole family were concerned.

&#x200B;

Long(er) story short, there was a big storm and something went wrong with our track so they let all the other fastpass holders onto the second track then quietly evacuated the building without telling us a thing. We were there over an hour by the time they lifted the safety holds and let us down the stairs to get out."
