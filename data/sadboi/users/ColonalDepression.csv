unpopularopinion,f4n3aud,t3_dkyy2v,1571685250.0,"I think the biggest issue with this (non-ethical) is that not all severe disabilities are present/noticable/developed to diagnosis at birth- so youd only be culling specific disabilities. 


Again, ethics on hold for the sake of this conversation, things like Quadriplegia can occour any point after birth so that wouldnt be ""prevented"", however conditions like Down Syndrome would be ""prevented"" at the loss of many people who live long, healthy, fulfilling and productive lives. 


You would also need to go through and very thoroughly define ""severe disability"" as depending on who you ask I imagine that could cover anything for Ehlers Danlos (not ""noticable"" at birth nor severely limiting in the majority of cases- though a struggle for sufferers) to Severe Deformities which with the rate of medical discovery could be ""fixed"" within a persons lifetime.


This would, as a byproduct, mean forcing any parent with a genetic/inherited disability to either not reproduce at all or risk having any child they birth with their genetic condition (be it present or skipped their generation) being killed.


It may sound merciful to kill the ""severely disabled"" people before they suffer but I think it's a unanimously held belief that at the very latest, after a person is born it is cruel/amoral/unethical to kill them. A disabled person should be allowed and assisted to end their life if they chose its what is best, but that isnt anyone elses choice to make (unless by medical proxy)."

AnorexiaNervosa,f3tix0k,t3_di3vql,1571136106.0,"I notice it too, my theories are:

Heat = expansion, all things get larger in the heat probably including parts of our body like the water in it.

Sweat = discomfort, which I've noticed we tend to mistake for feeling ""big"" because we've spent such a long time feeling discomfort about our weight.

Sweat + Heat = sweating more, which both means dehydration/water retention and drinking more which can end up being distributed as water weight in odd places (I've noticed my ankles, even).

All this combined- fatigue, discomfort, dehydration- likely preventing you from moving around as much as usual and perpetuating the feeling of ""bigger"".



On the flip side,

Cool = compact. Like ice, when most things are colder their structure tightens and appears smaller. Like with heat, I imagine this can make us feel ""smaller"".

Cold body temp = slightly higher BMR in order for your body to maintain homeostasis, which can make you feel hungry faster which I've noticed we associate with feeling ""small"".

Clothes - most winter clothes are over sized and comfortable which can make us feel more hidden and less ""large"". In summer people typically wear tighter or more revealing, bright, clothes which can trigger body image issues and draw attention to ""flaws"".

AnorexiaNervosa,f2qw2ad,t3_de1cq0,1570367301.0,"Your mother had almost definitely eaten before the BBQ, and likely picked more calorie dense foods or carbohydrates making her feel fuller faster.

She has also, most likely, been eating 3 full meals (and possibly snacks too) in the days leading up to the BBQ and so could still be feeling bloated or full from that.

Dont let this blip derail your recovery, of recovery is your plan. You not only tackled eating, but you did so around people and without counting calories before eating. That is *major* progress with an ED and you should feel proud- hell I'm proud of you. It may not feel like it now, but that BBQ was a win in spite of your mother being tasteless with her food comment."
therewasanattempt,f2qlwn9,t1_f2nugv8,1570364157.0,"I wouldnt call it rape, however I'm not sure what else to call the trapping of a panicked cow, forcing into a small cage type structure, and then doing the scientific equivalent to a turkey baster up and in. 

Sometimes a farm hand will also have to probe the cows anus with their hand and lower arm to make sure the ""Turkey baster"" is in the right place and they're not wasting quality bull sperm.


It sounds traumatic, even if cows arent as sentient as humans they are still very clearly intelligent and aware of what's going on around them. Some will run away from the slaughter house for no logical reason but that they can tell they will be killed. 

So, yeah, I dont think animals can be ""raped"" in the sense we imagine, but if they could be raped this would absolutely be it."
therewasanattempt,f2ql83p,t3_ddpzy2,1570363814.0,"The majority of cows end up as low grade meat once their milk production slows down, as farmers dont want to sink the cost of feeding, watering, and sheltering an animal that is less productive. 


Male ""cows"", IIRC, get slaughtered younger because their meat is the only valuable thing to come from them in the industries eyes.


The same thing applies to chicks, they are sexed (the correct term for determining their gender) and the females are kept as egg layers until they start to lay less eggs. Male chicks are usually immediately ""disposed"" of. 


So technically OP was right, even though cows arent slaughtered for dairy almost all of them will eventually be killed for meat."

I went for an ultrasound as a teen- not pregnancy, ovarian cysts- and the woman performing the scan went a little quiet before informing me that I have 3 kidneys as opposed to the standard 2.

It's still funny to see peoples reactions, and I'm secretly banking on Private Organ Donation becoming legal in my future so I can see off 1 or 2 of them providing they're all still functional independently.


It's a shame I couldnt get something cooler, like an extra heart, but I'll take what I can get considering it is yet to cause any kind of medical issue and the high demand for Kidney transplants."

AskReddit,f2k187v,t3_ddh8vm,1570280248.0,"Mid 2000s I'm on the tube to school, central London. I'm staring out the windows because I was too young for an iPod or anything.

I know this sounds insane, but I swear *I saw what looked like a small room inside one of the tunnels* with a few people in it. The ""room"" was lit and I only saw it for half a second at most, but they didnt look like squatters (because of the light) or builders (I didnt see  the tell tale neon yellow). If my eyes weren't deceiving me I think there may have been a table, too, but this is 15 years ago now so I could be wrong on that part. I was going from Brixton to Oxford circus for context of the route.



I've looked for information and seen a documentary that covered part of the history of the London Under ground (riveting I know) where I heard that there are some un-used stations and lines from the past.

 I have a theory that it was an old tube line that they closed down, but that still doesnt explain why it would be lit or have people in it while trains were running past it. Especially as anyone that's traveled by tube in London knows the force of the wind alone can be dangerous- another reason I dont think it was builders or maintenance in the ""room"".


I don't think I'll ever get an answer, but I still remember it vividly."

She ended up sleep microwaving food from her pantry instead that night.


In the end they concluded that falling asleep with her lights on was stopping her brain getting into a real deep sleep and ""turning off"" her body. I'm not sure if turning the lights off helped as they ended her story there."
