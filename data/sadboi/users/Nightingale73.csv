This summer, I visited the live-in babysitter my mother brought in when I was a baby. I was the third child. 

Without realizing it she said to me, ‚Äúyou used to call and call to me in the early morning to get you from your crib which was in your mother‚Äôs room. I was 19, an immigrant and not sure if it was okay to go in. But your mother never wanted to get up, even though you were in a soaking wet diaper so she gave me permission and I came in for you every morning. That‚Äôs why we had such a special bond. When your family moved away, I was heartbroken because she wouldn‚Äôt let me say goodbye to you.‚Äù

I am grateful to this now elderly woman. But my heart broke at this story. I am a mother myself and can‚Äôt imagine this scenario. I am 46 now and still struggle to trust.

Your mother was broken and your heart does time for her crime. I‚Äôm really sorry. I hope comfort will find you in another form if the blankies wear out. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

She also said God had shown her ‚Äòthe man‚Äô, an ex of my older sister, ten years my senior. I was discouraged from any extra curricular high school activities in order to prepare, wear winter undies to prep for garments and study my scriptures.

The entire next year, my mother built me an extensive trousseau, bore her testimony at church about ‚Äúthe bridegroom cometh‚Äù and they contacted the man, who took an interest and began to date me. He was a horrible person, demeaning, selfish, frequented strip clubs and gambled. I broke it off. My 18th birthday came- no husband. I got a job and left home. My family‚Äôs response? Granny was not wrong, the man used his agency for wrong and foiled the revelation.

My big brother went to the bishop and explained the craziness. He refused to speak reason to my mother.

This is the first time I have shared this outside of counselling. Hard not to blame myself for believing them, thinking they were led by God. My teenage was kind of robbed. I eventually married the first man who asked (met him on a mission), had a family, divorced, left the church and got a Master‚Äôs degree.

I felt pretty bad. I heard it all growing up and didn‚Äôt realize I kept the tape playing. Going to work on it hard."
Coffee,f40g0n8,t3_dj1f8p,1571297369.0,"I was mormon my whole life until a few years ago, then I quit. (Coffee & tea are forbidden to mormons).

When I found coffee, it changed everything. The glow has never worn off of a cappuccino every morning.  I feel incredibly happy each morning after having it and I love the routine. It has also seemed to fix my ever-touchy stomach by having it every day."
exmormon,f40fkls,t3_diyjkb,1571297056.0,"I was telling someone one day how when I left, my kids and I lost all our friends. But then I got thinking about whenever stakes/wards do a boundary change and you never see or hear from those people again.

Yeah, not friends, never really were. More like people who hung around tou to validate their own beliefs. It has nothing to do with you as a person."
Paleo,f40euy3,t3_disxb7,1571296542.0,"I‚Äôm at year 7, my weight is stabilized and I exercise daily. Remember, it takes time. It‚Äôs a life shift.

Like others said, I was strict at the beginning and then gave myself Sundays off. I can honestly tell you I began to routinely wake up Monday mornings feeling lousy so just gave myself the travel/social setting pass. Literally everything convenient includes grain so travelling sometimes you have to make an exception.

I did it less for weight and more for chronic tummy troubles and minor health issues that my doctor couldn‚Äôt pinpoint. Literally all of those disappeared. I love dessert and most of those cravings left too. 

Have a slice of birthday cake though when you‚Äôre at a party. So much of eating is ritual and togetherness. And stating ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have that‚Äù in a group is a real buzz kill."
CPTSD,f3yhpc5,t3_dipov5,1571254168.0,Absolutely. I almost wish I could control the emotion better because my reaction is so internally intense. Especially with males. The guy at the service desk at the pool where I swim recently helped me and I went home teary.
AskReddit,f3yfu3n,t1_f3xqf3t,1571253354.0,Yes. He‚Äôs 19 now and a pianist and med student. His hands healed with scarring but work fine. Thank you for asking. ‚ù§Ô∏è
AskReddit,f3xq9c0,t3_dirfpu,1571242245.0,Cars exploding. My dad had to tell me as a teenager it really didn‚Äôt happen.
AskReddit,f3xq33n,t3_dirfvd,1571242174.0,My 1 yr old son was learning to walk and toddled to the gas fireplace and placed both hands on. Third degree burns. Probably the worst day of my life.
AskReddit,f3xpnn8,t3_dimtei,1571241997.0,-40 C in the winter. People can‚Äôt even bear the thought but kids play outside in Canada all winter w/o a second thought and many Canadians actually love the whole season.
raisedbynarcissists,f3xpghx,t3_dimsz6,1571241898.0,"I hope the acknowledgment at least validates (as you said) that you were a child and he was the adult, and begins the road to some healing. Knowing something happened and having it be constantly denied is crazy making and you bore that aspect for far too long. It took courage to confront and courage for him to admit. Huge."
ptsd,f3xou2j,t1_f3x5mlw,1571241621.0,"Thank you for the kind answer. For the past 5 years since diagnosed, I never reacted with panic. That only began recently for me and has felt like a setback. I‚Äôve been testing myself with little things at home but the public aspect is frightening to me. Your ‚Äúworking your way up the mountain‚Äù is an image I will remember and remind myself of."
ptsd,f3xoagj,t1_f3xmvmr,1571241383.0,"Ah, good thought. Thank you for explaining. I am new to managing the panic aspect.

I was away for work this summer and caught a musical one evening with a friend of a friend I had just met. I was triggered and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I had to lean over and say as much. Even though I didn‚Äôt know her, she reached over and just took my hand. 

Wish the world was that kind in general."
CPTSD,f3wsggi,t3_dil6vg,1571218762.0,Yep. Mid 30‚Äôs. So hard to implement but still trying a decade later.
CPTSD,f3wscm8,t3_dikymw,1571218588.0,"Yes. And a specialist years ago, when finding absolutely nothing wrong with my entire gi tract said, did you suffer abuse in childhood or adolescence? I said ‚Äúyes, why?‚Äù He said, ‚Äúyou have no idea how many women I see where trauma is the sole common denominator. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I avoid almost all grains, all junk food, just many things that leave me knotted inside from years of experience. I also feel safer when I prepare/cook my own food. Potlucks terrify me.

So grateful, once again, to feel ‚Äúnot alone‚Äù for a moment. Thanks."
ptsd,f3ws33m,t3_digbjo,1571218155.0,I‚Äôm torn. My counsellor says that part of the key to overcoming triggers is to not avoid them but face them. Difficult to do when certain ones will leave you out of commission.
AskReddit,f3wrzvw,t3_difgvd,1571218005.0,"That despite what the news would have us believe, humans are living longer, being raised out of poverty faster, infant mortality is at an all time low and children are better educated than ever before, worldwide."
CPTSD,f3wrugd,t3_diij3s,1571217757.0,"Love. Every time I try with love, my brain starts doing this. When my parents divorced, my mum put me on my dad‚Äôs driveway and drove away. It was just before my 10th birthday.  All the counselling and education in the world have not managed to overwrite my brain- that someone who says they love you can very easily unlove you for even a minor infraction. So I remind myself why I am safe and competent alone in prep for this."

exmormon,f3u6stz,t3_di7z56,1571154104.0,"A class act. I admire her. It takes courage to say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù to anything after the church has told us we know everything. It‚Äôs good for children to know their parents don‚Äôt have every answer and that it‚Äôs okay to figure life out as we go, one day at a time."
exmormon,f3p5wjz,t3_dhfh15,1571045417.0,"I think it‚Äôs a pretty easy transition into an abusive marriage if you‚Äôve always felt like a zero who couldn‚Äôt measure up. I remember honestly thinking, ‚ÄúYou love me? Okay. This chance might not come along again.‚Äù I‚Äôm 6 years divorced now after 18 years in with the abuse. Stay strong. There‚Äôs light and hope ahead. Not religious light, of course. Your own light that was snuffed out for too long."
raisedbynarcissists,f3p54cs,t1_f3p4plz,1571044122.0,"Knowing someone understands it is enough. Thank you for your words. So much of the problem is the internal isolation and loathing. ‚ÄúA problem shared is a problem cut in half‚Äù, as my granny used to say."
