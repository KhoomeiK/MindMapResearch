I can totally understand why you would be peeved about it and not realize it, I think I'd be the same way. Doing makeup doesn't have to be for the sole purpose of attracting attention which is what is implied with the phrase ""dolled up"". I decided to google ""dolled up"" to just look at dictionary stuff for origin, etc, and I don't think the phrase by itself is anti-feminist, but the concept that someone (mostly women) would only do makeup/dress nice for the benefit of someone else, the benefit of being pleasing to look at is what is anti-feminist. 

So I could see how the phrase itself could just be pointing out someone did their makeup, and it doesn't really imply anything other than that, but considering we live in a world where putting effort into your appearance is still mostly seen as something women only do for the ""male gaze"" or only do for the benefit of someone else, ""dolled up"" really does seem to perpetuate that."
