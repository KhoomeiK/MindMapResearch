I did use the words of the question explicitly throughout my essay though to show that I am continuously referring back to the question and staying close to it when answering the question. I think due to the limited word count there is not much point of writing the full KQ in the essay.

EDIT- sorry that^ was about the IB prescribed questions. If you use secondary / subsidiary questions (which I did in my essay) that derive from the essay question then you should state the full Knowledge Q e.g â€˜a further knowledge question that may be derived from this is â€œto what extent ....

The major exam (A level) have been cancelled, as well as presumably btec / pre-Us etc. I just donâ€™t understand the difference, both A level exams and IB exams involve a large number of teenagers sitting in one exam hall, which is a risk and against social distancing. Also Boris Johnsonâ€™s announcement today that all pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms etc will be shut across England must be reason enough to cancel the IB in the UK, since Boris is pushing for social distancing.

But so far I have offers from Leeds and kings so it really isnâ€™t that bad!!

However if youâ€™re looking for a fun university experience, then St Andrews is a great option! I wouldâ€™ve applied there myself if they did law (also itâ€™s Scottish law so not helpful in my case)"

I have like you applied to both UCL and Kings but UCL does have a higher global ranking. But both universities are recognised worldwide which is really good.
