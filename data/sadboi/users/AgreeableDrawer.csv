It’s eery how blissfully ignorant people are. Also, fuck UW TACOMA. You’d think Inslee would divert funds for folks like us. I can’t get sick and I already live off funds from college and don’t know how I’m going to make rent with my fiancée."

MMA,fh2hohs,t1_fh1zivn,1581253116.0,"Is Jon truly that good? Or did his little hgh tummy help him out? I literally have not seen him fight well while not clearly on a cocktail of god knows what, besides probably grams of T. 

Jon is not the GOAT. Ngannou would take his soul. If Jon can’t handle a shot from a LHW and runs fingers out, what do people think ngannou is going to do to him? He would never sign the contract, the same against miocic unless he had enough picograms to fill a kiddy pool. Even then he’d get slept. Joe Rogan sounded like a retard. You know the whole reason Reyes moves backwards is to bait into a baptism. And yet he never shut the fuck up about Jon’s control.


Sure joe, he’s the goat and lost three rounds at his freshest and I quote “the best shape of my life”

The guy is a top tier lhw if he was actually off roids but any time his cycle is cut short he looks like dog shit. Reyes tuned him the fuck up. 

Someone explain how Jon is the goat when somehow he goes from massive, pulling 600+ to looking like a bit of a pot belly who hasn’t hit the gym in a year., you don’t lose muscle that fast. That’s not how bodies work. Call me a retard but his brother chandler doesn’t have any issue holding 295lbs. Why would Jon be any different?"
MMA,fh2h1zz,t1_fh1z4gl,1581252379.0,"Watching Reyes floor Jon in the first round and every time Reyes pulled Jon into following him only to mollywhop him because jones felt real power.

Reyes made Jon look like a joke on the ground and feet. So you’re the GOAT but a ufc fighter with 6 fights almost puts your lights out? Haha okay then"
