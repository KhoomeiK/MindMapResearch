AskReddit,f9gf8d6,t3_e4zjz7,1575298365.0,"Close to my house is a small forest that has a few dog walking routes scattered throughout and one of them is a perfect shortcut to a friends part of town. I used to walk along this route daily at points in my teens and a couple of years ago while leaving my buddies house I decided I'd cycle home through the forest, it was late and dark but I had lights on my bike and knew the route would likely be completely empty.

So I set off home and about 15 minutes into my journey and maybe a 3rd of the way through the forest it went silent, not a natural silent either, all I could hear was my bikes gears and chain clicking away and nothing else, usually you can leaves and wind, the odd bird or whatever else make a noise but this was _total silence_ so I stopped and it was almost as if I were deaf, I snapped my fingers besides both ears to make sure it wasn't just me and then went to get the fuck out of there!

But around 10 feet further down the route someone had tied fishing wire between two trees, thankfully as I had just stopped I wasn't going fast enough to injure myself but slowly being pushed backwards off of my bike by seemingly nothing scared the fuck out of me. It was still creepy quiet too so I didn't hang around and I fucked off back towards my buddies house and went the long way home.

That night creeped me out, I can't explain the silence but it stopped me from cycling into that wire at full speed. I don't even want to imagine what would've happened if I didn't stop but the silence itself gives me chills thinking about.."
