curledfeetsies,fibkt2m,t3_f7dlwh,1582324109.0,"I’m in utter shock! My cat is also called Addison, and I’ve never ever met someone with a pet with the same name. (Side note: I’m in Australia where it is an exceptionally uncommon human name, too). She’s so cute, I wanna love on her."
raisedbynarcissists,fi2o1xh,t1_fi2fjyw,1582084373.0,"Not at all too harsh. Actually super helpful to read, so thank you. I still am in the thick of it all, as I’m at uni and don’t live out of home. I need to be reminded that the way I act around them is ridiculous. I shouldn’t be sucking up so much. Reading back, I know I sound pathetic. I’d like to say in the past 3 years I’ve gotten a stronger back bone (which IS true), but I’m still a long way from a healthy relationship."
