GCSE,f73i4s6,t3_dub2z6,1573391741.0,"Your quote is a very good one to use in essays. Especially one which asks for a comparison of the effects of war with e.g Bayonet Charge or Exposure.

Basically, Armitage is trying to emphasise that these soldiers who get sent to deal with these people are doing this on an almost every day basis. The quote shows that there is a lot of uncertainty in the soldier's minds - do they fire or not? They don't know whether the people are armed or not, but as we see later in the poem, they continue with their job.This could be used to highlight that the soldiers have had their minds become ingrained with the ideology that whoever they get sent out to kill, they are expected to do so. This links to ideas of dehumanisation and the menta fragmentation of the soldier's minds, further supported by the links to PTSD with the quote ""the drink and drugs didn't flush him out.""

As the poem goes on, you get a further insight to how the soldier is dealing with the undermath. We are told in gruesome detail and in colloquial (informal language) terms that the people who they killed had their guts ""tossed"" in the back of the truck. This image stays in the soldier's mind and almost eats away at his mind which leads to PTSD and Psychosis ('he's here in my head when I close my eyes' and 'End of story, except not really').

Hopefully that should be enough for you. Remains was one of my favourites at GCSE and the one I used with War Photographer which we got in the Summer GCSE. Good luck for yours next summer! :)"
