And it's not bad to encourage self acceptance in others. But I bet it's helpful to yourself and others when you are raw and honest about struggling with such things yourself. It's better to not feel alone, and it's okay to be human. 
I think you're being too hard on yourself, as we anxious people often are."

I think our eyes could be very different and we could both have Exotropia still."
ADHD,ffqz00r,t1_ffc7hy4,1580146813.0,Yep! Me too. Exotropia is a kind of convergence insufficiency basically
ADHD,ffqyya6,t1_ffcbm23,1580146783.0,"Yes, this is essentially Exotropia. The eyes have a harder time turning inward to focus and maintaining that. I used to have to practice trying to go cross eyed to strengthen the muscles."

I use to not be able to cross my eyes or read very well. I got diagnosed with exotropia and had to do eye exercises. I also have ADHD."

AnxietyDepression,fcz8ucn,t3_ejl7gh,1578096002.0,"Hey there, it's going to be okay. I know that going back to school stress. I'm feeling it right now but with work. 

The nice thing about a lot of schools is they often have mental health resources. Is there a counselor you could talk to at school? That helped me in college when I was lonely, they helped me come up with ways to calm down and try to meet new people. 

Maybe you could try joining a new club to meet people. It will take some time until you form close friendships, so don't feel bad if you don't feel like you're making progress right away. 

And i'm sure you and your doctor can find another medication you can take regularly, I think it's a great idea to ask about. 

Even if your friend's parents split up i'm sure they all still care about you and you'll still be able to visit. Change can be scary and you sound like you have a lot on your mind, so the reason it's upsetting you so much might be because you're already on edge.

2020 is a new year, it doesn't have to end up like last year. You're already reaching out for help which is a great first step. You're gonna be okay."

Have you looked at any therapist with a sliding scale rate of pay? Or training therapists from a local university? Just wanted to share those possibilities in case you weren't already aware of them. 

I know you said you're avoiding medication, but meds made it so I could start working on my mental health and open up in therapy. They didn't take away the illness but made it so I could begin managing it. Just something to consider. 

I hope you at least share these feelings with someone in your life, a friend or boyfriend. You deserve support.

And my one coworker who found out about my anxiety is not very sympathetic, she just doesn't get it. So I feel like I have to hide it. And my ex dumped me recently, and I think part of it was because of my anxiety and how I needed to lean on him sometimes. 

It just feels like most don't really understands what i'm going through, and i'm afraid to lean on those who do because my ex has now made me afraid I and my anxiety are too much to put on others.

There isn't anything wrong with having lots of partners if that's what you choose to do. Which, it really wasn't your choice entirely. But, I just want to say that there isn't anything wrong with being promiscuous. Some people are just assholes and will judge you no matter what you do. 

Also, I don't think that that is that high of a partner count anyways. I know plenty of people with more partners at a similar age, I would never call them a slut.

You were assulted, assaulted, you shouldn't be the one taking responsibility for that. Those horrible boys are responsible, and they are fucked up and it has nothing to do with who you are as a person. 

You aren't damaged goods. Anyone who thinks so isn't worth your time. I'm sure you will find people who value you."
