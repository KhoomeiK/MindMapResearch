The guilt and anxiety is incredibly distressing. My only advice would be to talk to a professional or look up therapeutic methods that may help (CBT for example), if you haven't already done so.

Fetishes and any kind of sexual attraction is not something you choose or can control the fate of, it's just something you have, so it says nothing about your morality. The fear of people judging or hating you is understandable, but there are many people who would accept you, and even those close to you. And even if they don't understand it, you have the opportunity to change their perspective, part of judgement can be a lack of understanding rather than a genuine concern of something's harmful nature.

Also, a good psychologist would not judge you, leave you, look down upon you etc. that is not their job. If anything, they may have a much better understanding of your feelings than the average joe who comes across these things on the Internet and doesn't know what they are. They know what they are, what causes it, why people feel this way etc. and can help you deal with it judgement free."

mentalhealth,fdypmzf,t3_ene2qm,1578782295.0,"I used to spend some days with a group of people (only a small number I would consider friends) and would feel lonely afterwards. Because of my social anxiety I wouldn't say much and tend to fade into the background and could probably walk the other direction and feel like no one would notice or care. What helped me was learning how to appreciate my alone time, I essentially became my own best friend. I would go on walks while listening to music and thinking to myself. My advice would be to try and emotionally connect with yourself if you have not already, and enjoy your own company, once I started that it didn't effect me as much how lonely I felt.

Also, there are a lot of people in the world, all with their own unique behaviours and thoughts, and you will meet someone who you know you are good enough for and will emotionally connect with. And you are good enough for people, even if you don't feel it, everyone has something unique and positive to offer."
