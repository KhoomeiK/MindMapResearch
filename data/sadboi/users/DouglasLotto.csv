   I only ever met my father 2 times I remember cried because I was afraid of him. He was made out to be a monster by my mom. I‚Äôm bipolar and suffered from addiction a constant need to feel ok and warm not alone and afraid because your brain isn‚Äôt normal. I understand why he found himself in the place he did I just wish I could of hugged him and told him I love you and it‚Äôs ok we can get through this. But the world my mom included saw him as a threat and pushed him towards his only source of comfort the one that took him from me before I was old enough to figure this out for him."
