Glad you are still with us. Personally I use a song called Weightless by Marconi Union and keep ear buds handy. I step away and listen to it while using grounding techniques. A dear friend of mine hears voices and it's helped her in moments of panic, it works by having the bpm of a resting heart.

I love you, you are worth loving, there is a specialness about you that only you have and that light inside you I hope is always felt and known by you.

In 2010 I'd have never given up owning music it was still CD or MP3, now there's too many performers I love that spotify is my go-to love. I LOVE finding new content on there.
