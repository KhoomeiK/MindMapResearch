The thing is, is I actually don't care about the people I'm talking to. I don't mind assisting people. When it's an easy question I'm completely fine. But it's all the protocols that trip me up. I guess the only way to learn is by doing it? I don't know. There's so many things that it's kind of impossible to even have notes. Otherwise I'd have 100 notes."

But if I'm expected to work all my hours an do mandatory overtime and such, no thanks. I work to live not live to work.

My previous job I worked every other weekend. That gets old. I did like having off during the week, but it's not really worth giving up the 2 days off every week. Those two days recharge me."
callcentres,fqhvtvw,t1_fqf6mfd,1589385483.0,"I've been there trust me. It's good that you asked because that's how they get you. Otherwise I believe they can get sued if they say oh no, you're going to do this. Then your job changes. You could sue and say I quit because they said I'm a cook, but I never cooked and I did hosting only. Then you at the very least would get unemployment payments most likely due to their negligence.

With that said, it's rare anymore to find a job that will tell you that ""you're doing this one job and that's it"". Unless it's a labor job. Like a machinist or machanic. Typically those people do one job and have to get trained or specifically ask to do another job because it's too risky to put someone who doesn't know/isn't trained to do it."

depression,fq2qi49,t3_ggnfkp,1589058657.0,"My husband has that. It took that long for him to get diagnosed too. He almost died and they thought he had cancer and such. He lost like 40lbs at 13 years old.

He had to take steroids for awhile and it fucked him up. But now he takes other meds and an injection and he's doing much better. 

He's still very ocd about eating and when he eats. However he's not in pain 24/7. 

He doesn't drink alcohol at all. His doctor told him a long time ago not to. I don't drink either so it's fine. He had to find medication that worked for him. I think you can too. Multiple people in his family have it."

1. Technically, telling two people to hang out when you don't really want them too is a bad idea. I'm not saying keeping them apart would be a good idea, it's just that was probably a mistake.

2. The good news is that if you have nothing in common and two different beliefs, you might be better off. I'm not saying it's not possible to end up being soulmates, but it's honestly unlikely.

I like writing and I do attempt it sometimes but I very little motivation or discipline. You have to have discipline to finish writing a book. I paint, garden, and write and that's basically it. 

I've thought about working at a garden center. Maybe that would at least make me happy? I don't know. I wish I could tell you. But I'm in the same boat. My goal is to have a job I can get by in and afford my house and hobbies. Maybe get lucky one day and write a best seller lol."
AskAnAmerican,fp5rhlg,t3_gbh5fb,1588338187.0,"I know people who get up very early every single day and I know others that tend to not like mornings. I think it's what you learn as a kid. I've always been a night owl since I was a teen. 

I've worked middle shift most of my life. I tend to do better during that time because my brain is fully functioning. However, as I've gotten older, I find later shifts getting more difficult. Mentally it's a bit better for me, but my body doesn't seem to like it. I feel lazy all the time and tired. I also tend to not get anything done on days I wait around to go into work. 

Each shift has its ups and downs. I think middle and night shifts are becoming more common. But you're right, I tend to get a vibe from people sometimes that it would be better to find ""normal hours"". 

I do think in general, day shift is probably the best for our bodies. That's what I've found. I've done all three shifts. Night shift work wise is great, but lifestyle, health, sleep wise it's pretty bad. I felt like a walking zombie most days. 
Middle shift has a lot of ups, because you still get sleep and can sleep in. But with kids it can be out of the question. Also, I would say full time 8hr middles can get rough. It feels like all you do is sleep in and then get ready for work. And in my position, middle shift is the busiest. 
Day shift is so common so you see people, can go out after work, typically have the weekends off. But you're dealing with management, waking up tired and the winter time when it's dark out is rough.

They all really have positives and negatives. Day shift is just very common in America. Most people with degrees have those jobs so that's probably the main reason it's valued highly. 9-5 is probably ideal for me. But my father for example rather get up at 4am and get home at 2pm. He likes getting work over with."
jobs,fp4v6a8,t3_gaoqji,1588308223.0,"Your best bet is to look into hospitals or disability services. Hospitals tend to be less chaotic when it comes to social work jobs there. But it does depend on what it is. Also some disability services jobs tend to be a little better depending. Like waiver services, housing, events and so on. You feel like you're actually helping people. 

Any kind of rehab/addiction centers will slowly kill you. Also, group homes and such are tough. You will ultimately get burnt out. I worked at one for 4 years and by the end I thought I might kill myself tbh. The environments tend to be toxic and negative.

I majored in psychology. Thought I wanted to be a therapist. I still think being a therapist is probably the best bet in the field. But I never bothered spending the money for a master's and moved into healthcare instead. Social work is a tough and mentally draining gig. But it can be rewarding in the right environment."

I'm actually considering not having kids even though I want kids. Just because then I might be able to afford working just part time in ten years instead of being forced to work full time until I retire/die. I find part time work pretty doable, even in shittier environments. Just knowing you have so many days off does so much for my mental health. 

I also am trying to stay in my current network because we start off with 160hrs of PTO and it goes up from there the longer you stay. I don't know if I could ever survive at a job where my pto is like 7 days or something and 2 sick days.

Also, I've learned to call out when I want to call out. As long as I don't go overboard, I do it. Sometimes you just need to. 

If you really think you're going to be depressed and feel like this for the rest of your life because of working, think about living with very little. Grow your own food. Eat out rarely. I don't know what your living situation is, but consider just renting or buying a trailer, half a double. Something less costly. Work and save for the next 5 years or however long you need to have a chunk of savings. Then consider retiring early or working part time. Just remember that America sucks (if you live here) and you'll have to buy your own health insurance or get hit with a bill that's like 75k.

The other option is finding a job you can stand. Meaning, okay coworkers a manager who stays in their office and you rarely see, decent pto. Yes, just being able to stand a job sucks, but hey, you'll have money and a roof over your head."

But I applied to a position in another department for scheduling and I start next week. I'm pretty sure they are swamped and they aren't furloughing anyone because there is a backlog of appointments needed. 

I almost wish I never applied to this job because right now the ER job is very easy and it's like I'm being paid to do nothing. Then being furloughed once in awhile would be kind of nice. However, I know it won't be like that forever. Eventually patients will be pouring in again and so on. So hopefully this new position works out because I can't really quit right now.

My least favorites are Annie and Chang. I'm not into annoying perfectionist overbearing characters like Annie. In real life or in shows lol. Her cutesy oversexualization was funny at first but I found it creepy after awhile. I do feel like she changed for the better later on, but I feel like her relationship with Jeff should have completely dropped. I don't know the last episode yet, but I feel like her growing up should mean a future without Jeff. I feel like they are creepily toxic. And not because of age, but because of the way I feel like Jeff is an emotional vampire to her. Like he's using her to feel young himself this whole time. I want her to get her wings and fly free and find someone good for her. 
Chang I find annoying. I liked Peirce a lot and the crazy shit he'd say and the drama he'd bring to the table. When he left, honestly I felt the show was missing something. 
I love Britta, but honestly started to not like the show as much when they started to poorly write her character. Her relationship with Troy was done poorly imo too. It went on too long and should have ended quicker. I think it's such a shame that it almost felt forced to try and make Britta goofy to the point of unlikable. 

I love the show, but I have my problems with it. It's like it missed out on some potential."

The creator definitely has some fucked up relationship ideas. Because the sexual relationships in the show I found to be kinda bad. Britta and Troy's relationship was badly carried out. Started off with potential. But then half the time he was kind of rude to her and it lasted too long. I like that the relationship happened but I feel like it was badly handled. Britta herself became a punching bag for 2 seasons with 0 character depth. 
Jeff and Annie's relationship gives me the creeps and not because of the age difference but because of Jeff being a manipulative creep at times. Not to mention their relationship did start off pretty creepy.  I like to think Annie grew up and realized Jeff wasn't the end all be all of the universe and went and found someone better.

In general, the show just kind of lost a flow. I don't know what else to call it. There were definitely some good episodes still, but the first two seasons were perfect. I kind of feel like the story itself kind of lost its way."

- People who are positive and asymptomatic can continue to go to work. People negative get sent home. People with symptoms get sent home until negative. 

- Close all borders in the US. The only allowance is truckers and work purposes with proof of movement. 

- Have a timeline of how long the strict measures would be in place with a date of when general population can begin to return to work. 

- After that period of time, anyone returning to work gets tested for the virus.

- From there any locations with outbreaks go back to the strictest measures. 

The only way to slow it down and stop it is to go medieval. Locking the castle down and quarantine. Does it hurt? Yes. But it can literally abolish the virus if done correctly. It would take a few months and basically stop all large monetary transactions. Putting a pause on anything financial. It would require large scale military personnel. 

Outside of that, we find a vaccine or open everything up without a vaccine and just overwhelm the health system and run of medications, medical equipment, coffins and workplaces shut down anyway due to so many workers getting sick.

As someone who works in the ER, nurses and doctors and such, are more exposed to the virus on an hourly basis than anyone. They need to be switching masks more. Right now we are wearing them longer than we should be. 

The general public have no need for an N95. Nobody should be around people enough to be wearing them. A basic mask is fine for general public. Unless you are riding the bus everyday or going to work in a cramped office with others."
China_Flu,fn246vo,t3_fyvlgp,1586577391.0,The world is so fucked. Can't people just get the fuck along and take shit seriously? It's amazing how adults act like 5 year olds in this day and age.

China_Flu,fmwvxgz,t3_fxum1z,1586453981.0,The day the world opens up everything will go right back to a new normal. Economy up and everybody wearing masks. There will be outbreaks here and there. Eventually either a vaccine will come or herd immunity.

China_Flu,fmwvf6d,t3_fxw6w5,1586453725.0,Only doctors or medical personnel know the answer. No regular bum can give a good answer to this.
China_Flu,fmwutc0,t3_fxt4gz,1586453419.0,"I understand your concern.

I'm in the lane of listening to doctors and scientists. When their is a pandemic, I'm going to listen to science. But that's just me. 

Now, let me give you an example. I'm middle class. My husband and I are both working. I work in a hospital and my husband works at home. We have several thousand in the bank and are comfortable, but not rich. I suffer from depression, anxiety, agoraphobia and my husband has anxiety and ocd. I haven't seen my mother in months because she has high blood pressure, a previous heart attack and medical problems. My dad is overweight. 

If anyone should be pissed off about the shutdown it should be me because I was supposed to get a position out of the ER but it got pushed back due to this and now I'm stuck in the ER with COVID patients gasping for breath. Running out of PPE and in the middle of a clusterfuck. 

What I'm saying is, we are all people with problems. Right now we are trying to protect one another. Can the world shut down forever? No. But right now this needs to be done because the alternative is a disaster. The economy will jump back the day the world opens again. Lives will not. When your dead, your parents are dead, your grandparents, child, relative...you aren't getting them back. They will be gone forever and you can catch covid at their funeral. This is the unfortunate reality we are in. But it's the safest for all.

Covid doesn't care if you're rich or poor or ugly or pretty or young or old. 

 Right now at work, people are coming off of ventilators because they are getting proper care. If it was an overwhelmed system they would die."

Too bad Republicans said it was hoax for months."
China_Flu,fmwa64n,t3_fxo3rg,1586442731.0,Trump downplayed the virus since the beginning. He still doesn't believe in science. He's a total moron. Thank God for doctors.
China_Flu,fmwa36l,t1_fmvuw8b,1586442683.0,Trump supporters are inbreds. They don't believe in science or facts. There's no use talking to them.
China_Flu,fmw9rq4,t1_fmvtdbm,1586442503.0,"I don't believe you supported Obama even a little bit. Total lie. Republicans did nothing but call his wife a monkey and said he was a terrorist. You lie.

Republicans are the most hateful inbreds in this whole country. Many will die of COVID due to Trump's poor handling. Considering Republicans have many underlying complications in the south due to their inbreeding, meth use and obesity."
