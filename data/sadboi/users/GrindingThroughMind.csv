BipolarReddit,flt1tis,t3_fqr0mb,1585456741.0,"The hospital is for when you think you could be a danger to yourself or others. Although if you don't have providers (like a psychiatrist) to do continuous treatment, a trip to the emergency room may mean they connect you to such resources. But the short answer is that if you don't think you're going to try to hurt yourself, the hospital might not be the answer unless you can't find other resources to come up with a treatment plan. 

In a situation like this, it can be hard to think clearly about where you're at, and if these criteria apply. In which case, something like a crisis hotline may help, as they are generally equipped to help evaluate where you're at. Albeit they will tend to be conservative in recommendations and recommend hospital treatment because it is more defensible to recommend more treatment than might be necessary than less. 

Regardless, connnection with  a mental health expert may be necessary. Best of luck, and feel free to ask follow ups or DM if needed (I'm not always available to respond, but will do so asap when I can)"

I have kids though and can't help having some of their snack foods around.

I think it's tempting to be nostalgic for this sort of thing. I think it's possible to fall into a trap where that structure, that ability to forget about and put everything else aside (which is necessary at times) can feel like THAT should be the normal status quo. I've seen people take that too far, not taking their treatment seriously enough, almost pushing themselves for things to get bad enough that they can then push it all aside for a while in the hospital.

So yes, I miss it sometimes. But I never let myself forget that it's not a place where you can get all the treatment you need so much as it's a place where they make you solid enough to begin the REAL treatment, which can be messy and hard. 

Please understand I'm not saying I'm against hospitalizations, and not against repeat hospitalizations. I'm saying that precisely because they offer a reprieve, that can be intoxicating, maybe even addictive in its way.

I have a different issue with sickness when it comes to stomach viruses. In the early stages before I know it's just a virus, the stomach feeling strongly mimics symptoms of anxiety & guilt, and it's not uncommon for me to have an anxiety attack.

Again, if it's been a little effective in the past, there's combining drugs. Sometimes low/moderate doses of 2 or 3 meds will work better in combination than the max does of a single med. That's actually my situation: 200 lamictal, 1mg risperidone, 300mg seroquel.

For other drugs in the lamictal class (anti-convulsants) that are used for BP, the depakote and tegretol.

Aside from that there are many, many other options. It kind of depends on your particular symptoms though. More prone to lows than highs might recommend different meds than the reverse.

There's nothing wrong with someone in a relationship fantasying, being attracted to other people, etc. It's biological! And if the conversations etc didn't amount to a continuous contact with a subtext of likely intimacy (your call on whether that was the case or not) then it wasn't ""emotional cheating"" either.

From the sound of it, you feel guilty, but it also sounds like that's *YOUR* issue, *NOT* some type of actual transgression against your BF.

Alcohol at least you might be able to do in moderation, if you don't have addiction issues at least. You can have a single drink. Weed is a bit different, with its impact highly variable based on tons of factors. Something to consider.

Overall,  you have to come to terms with the fact that you simply cannot do the same things that everyone without your problems can do without having to worry about the aftermath. It's not just a BP thing, the same goes for just about any chronic illness. My wife has diabetes, since she was a child. Fully insulin dependent. She can't drink alcohol the same way another person could without risking, maybe minor but maybe serious effects. Getting buzzed or drunk can mirror the effects of low blood sugar, and if she thinks she's just buzzed but really has low blood sugar it's blackout + hospital time. She doesn't drink (not that she couldn't, with caution). She can't eat a simple meal without taking into account the impact it will have on her body. Growing up, she had friends with diabetes that took your attitude of ""but I want to"", and they ended up in the hospital numerous times, sometimes close to dying.

It sucks, it's shitty, pretty much everyone here gets where you're coming from, but you have an illness. With it come certain red lines. When crossed, shitty things can happen. Try to get your head around that. Therapy helps in general with BP, and if you're in therapy, discuss this issue.

Also, deep breaths, find something like a ""mantra"" to run through your head. I breath in on ""I'm"" and out on ""okay"" over and over. None of this is perfect, none a silver bullet, but might take the edge off. Also, you can always take a few minutes in the bathroom by yourself and let it all loose, cry, whatever you need. Sometimes the release is enough to help you go on a little better afterwards. 

Finally, if you truly just cannot handle things, you can leave, tell them you're sick. I'd caution against that if you can at all push through, keeping a normal routine, hard as it is, can be better than letting yourself fall further into the depression.

1) Is this likely to pass on its own in a reasonable (say, few weeks tops) period of time?

2) Is this impairing my ability to function normally, for example getting up, going to work, basic hygiene, etc.

If #1 is ""no"", or if #2 is ""yes"", then I'd say a med change may be warranted. You may not always know the answer to #1 though. It can take weeks to figure out. #2 is a bit more clear cut.

On another note, I'm on a semi-stimulant, or maybe atypical stimulant is a better term. Modafinil. One of its common off-label uses is to help with depression (or sleepy side effects of other meds).
