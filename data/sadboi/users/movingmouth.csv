Louisville,firm30y,t1_fipdfc4,1582666968.0,">All voters must produce identification or be known by a precinct officer prior to voting. Acceptable types of ID are personal acquaintance of precinct officer, driver’s license, Social Security card, county issued identification card approved in writing by the State Board of Elections, U.S. government-issued identification card, Kentucky state government-issued identification card with picture, credit card, or another form of ID containing both picture and signature.

So, you could be 75 years old, have lived in the same place for 50 years, never driven a car, and voted in every election that you've lived there, but this law says you can't vote unless you have a license or government photo ID. Just b/c your license is the easiest form of ID for you, does not mean that's the case for everyone."

Not that I am an expert but Booker (who I really like and support), would almost definitely not win against Yarmuth at this point in time, barring something very extreme on Yarmuth's part. Booker might do better than terrible in some pockets, but District 3 contains more Democratic votes than the reliably democratic ""Portland"" (which - I'm not really sure that's where Booker lives or grew up, and I think he currently lives in Russell). (Are you using Portland as shorthand for ""West End"" or another neighborhood in the area?) and I don't see Democrats overall (esp. in south and east ends) voting for anyone over Yarmuth. In fact, challenging an incumbent progressive and well-liked Democrat in a primary would likely cast Booker as an unserious and fringe candidate, all but doing him in as far as future elections aspirations or candidacies are concerned."
