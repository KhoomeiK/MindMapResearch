expats,fp1wbqj,t3_gaimte,1588249603.0,"I lived in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for 3 years, left last month. I take both alprazolam and Zolpidem and lamotrigine (epilepsy med) on a regular basis. I had no problem whatsoever getting these prescriptions filled in KL. Most doctors in KL are trained in the UK and overall my experience working with doctors and getting treatment in KL to be a breeze (and affordable) as compared to the US. In many ways, doctors give more attention and care and more open to patient needs and input.

If you’re okay with tropical weather, heat, and developing country, Malaysia is good. And KL and Penang are both great for expats. KL is big city, but feels small. (I regularly ran into people I knew across a city of close to 5 million people, much more often than I did living in a city of 500k in the US) Penang is better if you are looking for a more midsized city. I can’t speak to living there, but I hear it’s as good for expats as KL. 

Nature is incredible, if you don’t mind TRULY going out in the wild (think leeches, monkeys, tigers, elephants). Don’t expect anything manicured or organized like US national parks.

Though note, like most countries across the world right now, Malaysia is on a fairly rigid lockdown until May 12th (expecting that to be extended). And closed to foreigners as of Mid March like many other countries in Asia.

Of course, like anywhere you might live, KL and Malaysia have their downsides. I could go on about that if needed. But overall, it’s super laid back & affordable. Although a developing country, it provides all the comforts of a first world country to those who can afford it. Which at 2k a month of passive income, you can more than afford it in KL. 

Last note on medical stuff. Overall, medical care in Malaysia is extremely affordable and inexpensive compared to the US. With no insurance, little as $15 for GP, $50-75 for a specialist. Although while medical professionals are cheap, those medications (while easy to access) are not cheap. For 30 day supply, expect $200 for Lamotrigine, $100 for alprazolam, and $100 -150 for Zolpidem. Compared to my $10 RX coverage with insurance in the US, those prices are high. But given how cheap it is to see doctors in Malaysia, the costs balance out, and you probably come out ahead overall as compared to US.

Let me know if any other questions about Malaysia. Can make doctor recs too."

(Or at least traveling around NZ for a while) Then Coronavirus hit. We’re frantically trying to close up shop here, get work permits canceled, etc. so we can accelerate our departure to NZ but not sure we will make it before the “gates” of our respective countries close. Any insight to someone considering coming to NZ right now in the midst of all this? I’m convinced it’s going to hit and get bad everywhere. It’s just a matter of deciding where would I rather be when it gets bad."

Being at home all day allows you the opportunity to go slower, be more relaxed, and intentional with your day. Suddenly you have much more time. Try the things you’ve always wanted to. Try yoga, challenging exercise, apply lotion s l o w l y. Make the best omelette known to God. Paint, face mask, push ups. You have more time to dedicate to your health through exercise and healthy eating. In the end, your body will be better for it."

expats,f8dhcik,t3_e0apm8,1574490857.0,"Yeah, this doesn’t sound like culture shock. It sounds like frustration. I can relate. I moved to Malaysia from the US three years ago, and one of the things I miss most about the US is the comparative ease and efficiency of most basic services in the US. I feel a bit trivial and entitled to admit this. (The definition of FWP) But I know what you mean and it can really put you off an entire culture/ place, as terrible as that is. For me, the headaches and frustration have only been increasing over the three years I have been here. What I’ve found helps me most is to stay focused on something you’re looking forward to in the future. Whether that be a family vacation, plans to see a movie next weekend, aspirations to get your Master’s degree in a few years, or your next move (maybe back to the US?) a few years down the road. If you’re not feeling  fulfilled with the present, keep your mind on what’s next."

Cyclicvomiting,f3b7ad1,t3_dg85w7,1570803488.0,"I’m really glad you posted this. Sounds super similar to my experience. I have found little to no medical evidence for how or why, but diet change was also able to put my symptoms at bay. 

But there it is. 

After a late onset at age 30, I struggled with CVS for about 7 months. I only had one good day for every 20 bad day. It was all awful. Pretty much ruined my life over that 7 month period. Jobs lost, social life lost, etc. Of course, I tried every medication, every test possible done. Nothing worked. 

Finally, out of desperation, I just quit eating and went on an extended fast. My fast lasted about 11 days. Then once I reintroduced food again, it was gone. No problems. I really didn’t start fasting with the intention that it may help, but it did!

It wasn’t until about 3 or 4 months later that I had another light onset of symptoms, but I was able to reset again with another short 4 day fast. I have no idea why it worked, but it did. And I am so so grateful. I was living in hell with CVS. I have no idea how or why this works for us. But I’ve been told that fasting puts your body into ketosis, so essentially creating the same effect and possibly same reason why keto is helping you. 

There aren’t many stories out there like yours and mine. I hope more people on this sub try keto or fasting as a way to control symptoms. Maybe it would help others too! Thanks again for posting!"

I wish I could say take your meds, but can’t bring myself to. I don’t think that’s anyone’s choice but your own. 

Nonetheless, I’m also gonna jump on the analogy bandwagon:

Better to take the stairs down now while you still can instead of waiting for the building to collapse."
BipolarReddit,f2jgomr,t3_ddhpr7,1570272283.0,"I’m not from California originally, but I lived there from 2008-2010. I was put on a 5150 in 2009 at the age of 23. If you were held at Langley in Feb, hey, maybe we shared a room.

I’m absolute in my belief that 5150’s are not the answer for every person that’s experiencing mental health issues, including psychosis. It definitely wasn’t for me. 

I completely agree with one of your comments that first line of defensive should be intensive outpatient first, not an involuntary hold.

The first time I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was locked up on a 5150. Here’s a tip for doctors. If you want to ensure that someone fights hard against believing their bipolar diagnosis and if you want to set them up for months of noncompliance to medication, put them on a 5150 when you make the diagnosis.

I have never fought something so hard and become so enraged as the time someone took away my personal freedom and held me against my will due to a label of “insanity.” 

Was I psychotic? Probably. Was I a danger to myself or others? Not in the slightest. 

I was not suicidal nor had I threatened violence against anyone. Therefore I feel like my 5150 was completely unjustified and unhelpful. 

Hospitals are not the best places for mental health recovery. You’re in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by strangers, many of whom are deeply experiencing their own mental trauma. You’re literally stripped of your clothes and personal belongings. You’re untrusted to be alone, have shoelaces, toothbrushes, and you’re constantly being watched. Being under lock and key against your will is only adding to the injury. This environment is completely unhelpful and I would argue, further traumatizing, to someone struggling with mental health problems. In truth, the 5150 only adds to the problems. For me, it helped amplify my paranoia against people who cared about me, it ensured my resistance to medication, and deepened the depths of my sadness, my aloneness and despair. 

I would abolish that legislation in an instant if I had the means to. No one else should go through what I did. 

Good luck with your work."

BipolarReddit,f1ii06h,t1_f1glj0t,1569510737.0,"Very interesting to read some about your experience. Sounds like you’ve experimented a lot and learned some valuable insights!

Over time, I’ve slowly learned a little about some of the solutions you mentioned, but I really feel like I’m just scratching the surface to understanding what can help. 

The cold water thing that you mention is interesting, because I haven’t read a lot about it. I realized almost by accident that cold water can be enormously helpful for my mood regulation. If I’m rocketing into unbridled rage, cold water can help slow me down or bring me back to a normal range of thought and emotion. I haven’t actually explored it as a way to remedy brain fog though. Would love to hear more about that.

Overall, of the things you mentioned, what has been the most helpful behaviors or techniques you use to counter the issue of brain fog?"

And of course the universal hand-signal for “call me”
