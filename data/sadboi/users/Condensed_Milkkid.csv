depression,fb65emh,t3_ebhs7s,1576541817.0,"I kind of get what you mean a lot of young people feel like they can't talk about their disorders because older people always push it to the side like ""oh they're too young to be depressed"" "" life's so easy nowadays what have you got to be depressed/anxious about"" it's exhausting. Tho I'm not white I get it"

Anxiety,f9vt3c9,t1_f9vsk2p,1575679013.0,...I'm not sure if you read my post wrong or what but like... I didn't say I think people are faking it...  I'm talking about people who don't have a disorder and pretend they do. I get people need attention but I feel like faking a disorder isn't the best way to do that?
