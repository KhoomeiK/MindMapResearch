hsp,fpqqqjm,t3_geviep,1588829536.0,"My answer is a little different. I’ve been doing therapy for 5 months and on and off years before that.
In the last year a few things have really helped me heal.
I found a therapist that I really have developed a trusting relationship with whose helped me make some great breakthroughs.

Another is going to burning man and microdosing  psychedelics there. I know it’s very cliche but I experienced a sense of one ness with other humans and a feeling of family way beyond what I feel in the normal world, which I experience a lot of tension and social anxiety in.

For some reason that dose of experiencing reality in a different way kick started a more positive mindset for me because it made me realize I didn’t need to hold on to the fear of lack as much as I needed to appreciate the abundance of love/people/joy that is out there for everyone. 

There’s a reason psychedelics are being researched a little more seriously now for therapy in dealing with trauma and mental illnesses. They not only help you break down your though processes, but also help you face and process your emotions and fears, and help reprogram your thinking to be more positive and open and less fearful.

I’m not saying everyone should go out and do drugs, especially not in every day settings, but depending on where you are in your brain reprogramming journey, it’s an amazing tool when done in the right place and environment and around the right people. It can help “purge” some of that really deep, sad, angry feelings and help you come out lighter because you faced and acknowledged and validated that emotion.

That being said I am more sensitive than average to drugs in general so it can def be very intense. Therefore I recommend starting with baby steps and microdosing and working your way up as you’re comfortable with. I have a hard time giving up control so it’s a challenge for me at times but So far I’ve largely had positive outcomes."
hsp,fpqpgzz,t1_fpq4tr5,1588828544.0,"Wow this is so relevant to something I’m going through lately. I’ve been doing CBT for about 5 months and only recently started feeling like I’m getting somewhere with it.
The whole family/parents neglecting emotions and leading that to the suppression of emotions is something I’ve just recently started to understanding.
The counter measure to this is largely learning to o validate your own feelings- either by processing them yourself in some way, or sharing them with someone, really just something to acknowledge that what your experiencing is real, is valid, and you’re allowed to feel what ever you need to about it. 

Getting away from and limiting contact with “toxic” family members really helped me move along and evolve, so I don’t know how old you are, but know that you’ll get away from your parents eventually and can let the healing begin then"

I don’t think we hallucinated it, pretty sure it was a fancy bought out white tie event, but I thought it was pretty funny to be walking by it and causally randomly experience a dinner party going on the front lawn there.

Btw- the trailer park right next to it is probably an example of some of the biggest, fanciest “trailer”/I.e manufactured homes I’ve ever seen. Like full on trailer park mansions?

I think it’s great to be vegan for environmental reasons but if someone eats meat there’s a number of ways to do it properly. The way I see it the true culprits aren’t people eating meat, that’s a natural craving to have as an omnivorous species- it’s mass factory farming, monoculture, and not eating a local diet, and being unaware of where meat comes from, excessively eating meat. 
I.e if you decide to eat meat at least know who is killing it and what the animal is going through to become your food. And then they should waste not want not.
Kind of like the native Americans did- with great respect for nature. They thanked nature for its sacrifice and then used every scrap of the animal, and they never took more than they needed.

AskReddit,fnnqlpi,t1_fnnmrck,1587098918.0,"I know, but just to be real, many small retail business owners have been hit pretty hard by the shutdown, and with the economic uncertainty people just aren’t spending as much. Or they’re saving and choosing to spend their money on things like booze and alcohol instead of jewelry or clothes. They don’t have anywhere to go out to and flaunt their stuff, and no reason to buy it! I really hope things spring back a bit soon but I can also see things not returning to normal for a while.

I making a decent living doing freelance design and working on other projects here and there so thankfully I know I’ll be alright even if I shutdown and shift my business or energy towards something else"
AskReddit,fnnq8ze,t1_fnnnzji,1587098647.0,"I try to stick to sterling silver and gold filled materials where I can, especially on necklaces (because they contact with skin and there’s nothing worse than getting a rash from a crappy necklace). 

Most of the earrings w hooks have either stainless steel or hypoallergenic hooks. Same with the studs.
There’s a few styles that I might recommend avoiding if you are concerned about a nickel allergy- simply because they are made from “metal alloy” I’m not 100% sure what’s in them. That being said when I source some components or styles from somewhere I make sure to wear them myself to make sure they’re comfortable and don’t cause reactions. Everyone’s different but I’m fairly sensitive to metals as well and if it doesn’t pass that test I won’t sell it. 
I write materials in the product description, if theres any other questions or concerns you have about a specific product please feel free to email or message me!"

Probably gonna clear out my inventory (sale!) and shut the site down soon though.
Accessories and jewelry seem really superfluous and not important with everything that’s going on right now. 
But check it out and buy something if you want and use the code LUCKY13 if you wanna get a discount on it.

Right to repair? Sure, we’ll give you the right to repair! But also we don’t have to hold companies to any sort of quality standards anymore so they can make unlimited quantities of crap! Oh and also 1 million extra for every rich person!"
