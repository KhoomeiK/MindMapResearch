So if you want something long-term, your SO has to know how your disease works and be willing to accept you for you. If you find someone, open up. Watch videos on it. Go to counseling together so they know where your at and you know how they are feeling. I've been married 10 years, I don't know why she stays sometimes, I'm such a ass and so depressing. But she has her own issues also. There are times I do try to isolate for weeks from her. And I hate myself for it, but she is kind enough to forgive and keep going. It's not impossible, but it is work and forgiveness and love."

How your disease affects you. At times in my life it was exercise, then it was playing multiplayer games and chatting online. Now it's feeling like I have a purpose in life, so I try to volunteer some and fix small engines. But as I write this, I'm laying in bed. Some days the bed just wins. But, it much less often now.

I'm sorry if I sound judgemental, maybe I read the post wrong. I only wish you the best, I would not tank your main relationship for someone who has flaws to you and perhaps even lies. ‚òÆÔ∏è"

To anyone saying a mobile home is a waste of money. Not to me. If something breaks, it's a quick fix. It's not complicated like a house. I've owned both, and at 42 years of age I spend most my time keeping up with my parents house. That is a money pit."

Every time I got manic I felt like a god. I treated her horribly.  I would do anything for a do-over. Now I'm medicated, now I could be that guy she thought I was. I spent years mutilating myself, to not feel that pain/ to punish myself. NOT RECOMMENDED. It's good that you're to the point you want him to be happy. Your happiness will come.

bipolar1,f6tikep,t3_dsk3vw,1573149453.0,"My first wife left me after I had a 2 month sex/drug binge. I was in my early 20s and not taking any treatment. I remember coming out of that episode not even sure what really happened and what might of happened. Until the credit card bills  and divorce papers hit. I lost my soulmate, the one I compare all others to. It use to consume me, that loss. But my disease is one of emotion. I will still have days I hate myself/wish it was over/ball my eyes out. After half a lifetime, I have come to realize that every passing second is nonrefundable. When I mess up, I try to make it up. It's really hard to think of myself as a good person. I'm depressed right now so this post is not so much enlightening as it is therapeutic. Take care, be open with those you love."

bipolar1,f47pbgm,t1_f462wtg,1571425946.0,"Not an outsider. There are many people in your situation. Maybe not exactly, but can relate. I just got done sleeping 11 hours, it's in the 40s today, and there's this hole under my house I need to patch. I don't see that happening, I'm probably going back to bed. That's part of my cycle, so I'm just going with it. Bipolar 1 is a disability, you can get disability especially with a rough work history. But there has to be some TV show, movie, game, hobby you enjoy. If your really down today, indulge yourself. Make today less crappy. Tomorrow try not to isolate. If your at the end of your rope, think about the hospital. Doesn't sound fun, I like to call them vacations now. Atleast I get 3 meals a day and hang around a bunch of other people feeling the same way that you can relate to. Whatever you do, don't give up. There is a way of life for you where there is still some happiness, even if you have to endure long depressions. My thoughts and prayers are with you."
bipolar1,f45kch0,t3_dj4b65,1571380893.0,"As someone diagnosed in my late teens and I'm almost 42 now I can tell you every single person with Bipolar has there own unique version. Late teens to 28, manic more than depressed with periods of hypermania and lows of trying to take my life. 28 to 35 was 50/50 high and low. 35 to 42 I'm mostly depressed, no meds seem to be working, but this is my one life and there good moments still to come. Personally, feel I have a blend of diagnosis that will make me more depressed the older I get. With PTSD, general anxiety, chronic fatigue, bipolar 1, ect. I can't seem to treat one without it affecting something else. I would ask your Dr about chronic depression and chronic fatigue, but also be honest with yourself. Ask friends or family of they have ever seen you in a manic state. Read about different manic states and explain it to people. Like I said, my disease is my journey, my road. No one else will walk it. But if your over 35, I've heard multiple people say the depression starts to take over the older they get. I have had to find my own work, make my own jobs. I have not clocked into a job somewhere in 13 years because I can't get out of bed for a week or two. It's not hopeless, but it's really hard. Best thing you can do is talk or type to  others who atleast are familiar with mental health and how they cope. I wish you the best."

What I would give for some Adderall or something to JumpStart me out of this. But of course our country has to be overly anal over drugs that would actually help a person through there disease. In the 90s medical philosophy was a patient should never have to suffer. Now it's, but what if he becomes a addict and Sue me? I guess you can't Sue me if just kill yourself.

Congratulations, your part of a higher class of bipolar. meds, diet, and exercise-repeat. Don't let yourself have the ability to spend more than $500 unless you have talked it over with someone.

Definitely try to get some anxiety meds and someone you trust to watch over your financial choices during those extreme times. I was fortunate to marry someone who knows all 3 of me very well.
