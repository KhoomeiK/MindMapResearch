I didn't feel like helping to pick out my girlfriend's cosmetics one day at Ulta, so I wandered over, saw Johnny Depp's handsome face on the ad poster, and the rest is history.

My first purchases were Sauvage EDP (which I honestly still like, but to a lesser degree now) and Mugler A*Men. Let's just say there was a nuclear level of trial-and-error sprays that may or may not have caused dozens of casualties lol"

malefashionadvice,fdqbykj,t1_fdpgom8,1578662496.0,"Chanel Egoiste Platinum. I recommend this because it was huge in the 90s, but it hasn't remained popular the way something like Acqua di Gio has. But, older people *will* recognize the smell and make very masculine associations with you then, I think. I'm sure even younger people like my age (23) would say 'woah, that smells like a man'. It has gorgeous lavender and oakmoss in it, plus some very dry and bitter floral and herbal notes. Works well across all seasons and weather except for the extreme cold imo, so it's quite versatile as well. I think it would be a great way to help your image/'aura' as you transition. Best of luck!

side note: it may be hard to find this except in some department stores. If you're unsure, email Chanel and ask for a sample. They mailed me several before. I don't think it's necessary personally, I don't see how anyone could hate this gorgeous cologne, but everyone's nose is different so better safe than sorry."

malegrooming,fdgtw7d,t3_el3hx7,1578408210.0,"1) If you order from Maggard razors, their in-house brand has many razor heads to pick from. V3A is the most mild and the one I'd recommend for a beginner. My girlfriend uses this one for leg shaving. Excellent razors for the price. Great way to start. After you're more comfortable I'd move up to the V3 which I currently use. By far not the most aggressive, but it's a good balance for me since I sometimes shave a bit carelessly and would likely cut myself with a more aggressive razor.

2) I have issues growing facial hair too. Comes in thick, just in the wrong places. Ever since switching to a safety razor I've found that it's a joy to get a nice close smooth shave, and have embraced the baby-face ever since. It's almost a disservice to call it a baby-face because that might imply that it's unattractive or unmanly, which in my experience has been the opposite since my girlfriend seems to enjoy me not having harsh, unsightly stubble."

But if a vintage jacket in question is from the era, then it was made to milspec and any difference in quality would be negligible since they needed to be battle ready. As long as you can verify that it is an authentic garment I wouldn't be too concerned about what company made it. I went through all of these hurdles when I bought mine so I'm trying to spare you the headache haha. If you insisted on buying one brand new I think the Alpha Industries one would be fine, even if they do outsource the labor now.
