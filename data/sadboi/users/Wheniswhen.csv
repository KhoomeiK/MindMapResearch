Nootropics,fpem68d,t1_fpeljd3,1588550231.0,"Oh ok that's a lot better haha. You had so much knowledge on it that it was hard to decipher. Well so far it's been a week and I've noticed great results In a number of different areas. However, I'm not sure if it's the supplement or my anxiety which is causing horrible insomnia. I've only been getting about 3 hours of sleep a night which is unusual for me. If if doesnt let up tonight I'll have to stop and reasses to see what is going on. Thanks for the info though! How did you find all of that and piece it all together? I typically read tons of Wikipedia pages on it and haven't seen anything as complicated as what you stated. Sounds like it came out of a medical journal or a text book"
Nootropics,fpeccck,t1_fpe7n6j,1588544701.0,I have no clue what all that means but it sounds pretty damn smart haha. So is it dangerous to take or no?
Nootropics,fpds7hn,t1_fpdrou6,1588533167.0,"True. My doctor wants me at 2400 preferably but it seems a bit much imo. I'll stick with the 1200mg and see how it goes. If things continue to improve I'll stick with the side if not I'll up it slowly to the desired dose. 

Hopefully all goes well. Thanks for your input!"
Nootropics,fpdr9hu,t1_fpdlsyn,1588532625.0,"That's definitely comforting. Thats the thing though is that even though there is some evidence that NAC may harm the heart, my doctor still advised me to take it and this is a supplement that's well known and used. You would think that if there were serious cardiac issues involved someone would be reported it by now and you would've seen a recall."
Nootropics,fpd3n3s,t1_fpd3a8e,1588519144.0,"It's definitely helped me in terms of some somatic obsessions, depression, and anxiety that I have. I feel like I can think much clearer then before and I'm not obsessively concentrating on my breath. All of which are good improvements. I'm just super concerned about the cardiac and alcohol interactions I might have had with it. 

I do overanalyze things which makes it basically difficult to get any sort of treatment since I'll take something, see some benefit, then research the he'll out of it only to find some obscure unproven study, comment, or personal experience which showed some dangerous side effect. That's the case with NAC."
Supplements,fpd1ufq,t1_fohga9l,1588518035.0,"Jumping in on the cardiac issues here. I take 1200mg of NAC just started a few days ago and was directed by my doctor. He said he hasn't heard of any such thing when I asked him. I also did some resesrch and the only studies I see that support that are animal studies with high levels of the supplement.

Also, I think just common sense wise this supplement was in use for a long time and it's not some obscure supplement no one's ever used before. You would think if it causes cardiac issue we would've heard about it by now. Just my opinion, I'm not a doctor, but I had the exact same concerns as you.

What's everyone else's opinion?"
Nootropics,fpd0q7a,t1_fpd0cmc,1588517323.0,What? I only drink occasionally. I didn't think it was a big deal since it was only 2 drinks and over 14 hours passed since I took my NAC. Plus my doctor didn't say anything about it and the only evidence I can find to support liver damage from NAC and alcohol is an animal study saying it caused liver damage if taken 4 hours after drinking. I waited 4 times more than that. I thought I was safe.
COPD,fooeqlg,t1_fooe2qd,1587937645.0,"Yeah! That's sort of what's going on with me. I've been to so many doctors and ERs just to be told that there was nothing wrong me with me and my Xray, pulse ox, and physical were fine. It is really odd though because I can't breath even though there is no trigger. I really hope that it is my anxiety and not some sort of lung. I'm just not sure though because this happened after I started smoking the hookah and continued since I stopped. I have an appointment with the lung doctor but this virus is pushing it back."
HeartDisease,fng12ys,t1_fncm6kt,1586919856.0,"I honesty was leaning more towards this. It doesn't seem like I can get a diagnosis for it though. I tell my PCP and he just says that it's anxiety then I tell my cardiologist and he believes its dehydration. Both of them don't seem to take my concerns seriously. Who can I turn to to get a diagnosis of this? Also, any personal experience with this issue?"
depressionregimens,fli5h6v,t1_fkrok4m,1585175700.0,"Just wanted to give you a bit of an update with my meditation regime and its effect on my mental health. So far I've seen continued improvement in my wellbeing, depression, anxiety and attention issues. I'm starting to go for walks everyday and actually enjoy them. I'm able to articulate myself well and with an adequate amount of detail. I just feel a lot more present and calm overall. Definitely a great and worth while addition to anyone's regime. I typically do mindfulness meditation for about 20 minutes every morning. The difference is unexpected considering all I'm doing is just focusing on my breath but it is definitely a game changer for me. Best of luck!"
HealthAnxiety,fli4d8f,t1_flhz935,1585175080.0,Thanks for the advice. I'll try to push through it and direct my attention to something a bit more productive and entertaining.
HealthAnxiety,fli46x2,t1_fli2alo,1585174985.0,"Hello! Great to hear from you. The funny thing with my body is that I have the complete opposite reaction actually. I take this multivitamin every now and then and it seems to make my symptoms flare up! Very odd and distressing. It's horrible and terrifying having the sensation of not breathing. Luckily it finally ended a couple hours ago and I am back to  somewhat normal. 

I've been to multi doctors, multi ER visits, Urgent Cares you name it haha. They've only ran an X-Ray, physical exam, and pulse ox. Everything was completely normal. However the last time they referred me to a pulmonary doctor mostly because I just kept coming back to them. 

Thank you so much for the empathy and it honestly makes me feel much better to hear that I'm not the only one struggling with this too!"
HealthAnxiety,fli3odx,t1_fli2q1x,1585174706.0,Thanks for making me feel a bit less alone with this issue. It definitely takes some of the suffering away. These bouts of air hunger are the worst but thankfully it ended a few hours ago.
HealthAnxiety,flh5l92,t1_flh5g1t,1585156511.0,It's the worst at night. I honestly have no clue what to do at this point. I've pretty much bothered every healthcare provider I know about this issue to no avail although I'm seriously struggling.
depressionregimens,fksl27t,t3_fgpimw,1584492502.0,"Rexulti for me was a tricky medication. It really helped with my depression and anxiety to the point where i was much more functional and satisifed. I thought that I finally found the medication for me! No noticable side effects at first just all positives. I stopped ovethinking, enjoyed life, and wasn't anxious or obsessive. Then I started to notice that I was becoming increasingly impulsive. I was drinking, taking money from people and going on random road trips to different states for no apparent reason. I was like what the hell is going on with me, I knew I was not like this before. I looked it up and aparently this medication along with Abilify can cause impulsive behavior. So I immediately stopped that thankfully before any permanent damage was done. Just from my experience my advice is to give it a try but look out for any changes in your personality. Like are you having impulsive sex, gambling, or engaging in unsafe drug use. This all happened in a matter of a week or two btw. It worked pretty fast."
depressionregimens,fkskjhu,t3_fhzs3i,1584492164.0,"I have ADHD and depression among other things and I can tell you that stimulants, at least for me were a very tricky thing. The first week of taking a stimulant when you are depressed is great. You feel so much better; you can think clearer, you have the motivation to participate in life and the confidence to go about your day. Then things began to dip after the one week mark. I began to become horribly depressed, anxious and angry. It definitely was not worth it in the end for depression. I don't even think it was worth it for my ADHD symptoms either just becuase of the huge amount of other problems I was dealing with. I believe that if I can take care of my depression and anxiety that my attention and organizational problems wont be an issue. I would of course talk to the doctor about it because everyone  is different. However, I can say that Modafinil,Armodafinil worked well for my depression, attention, and marked cognitive issues while not causing much of a worsening for my depression. Despite this I had to discontinue it becuase of my anxiety."
depressionregimens,fksk1t4,t3_firzeo,1584491847.0,"If we are not talking side-effects then Trintellix, lamictal, or Effexor XR. Either of those worked well for my depression but caused bad side effects so I had to get off them."
depressionregimens,fksjwru,t3_fisjvs,1584491756.0,"For some reason a multivitamin or B-complex gives me a little boost of energy or vitality. Coffee works too like you said. Dark chocolate, a protein shake with fresh fruits and vegatables, or going out and talking to people or hanging out with friends...if I had any!"
depressionregimens,fksj046,t1_fkq9opr,1584491179.0,For some reason this seems like the most effective answer yet for another reason I can't bring myself to try it. Maybe i've become too dependent on medication to lift my depression. I really should give CBT a fair shot
depressionregimens,fksiwtx,t1_fkq5fcs,1584491122.0,"I really hope the pessimistic prediciton is not accurate haha. I am really hoping that psychedlics can usher in a new age of treatment for depression and such. We've been using the serotonin agents for quiet sometime and although I hear some success with them, there are still tons of people who do not see any or very little improvement. Hopefully some MAOIs will enter the market without dietary restrictions. Or perhaps  a balanced triple reuptake inhibitor."
depressionregimens,fksioi8,t1_fkro73r,1584490972.0,"I've been thinking of bringing up the MAOIs with my doctor but I am way too afraid to take them. The dietary restrictions scare the crap out of me. Hopefully one day they can find a way around them because it seems like people have a lot of success with that class of medicaiton. 

I'm trying to take a look at my environmental factors too so I can get a grasp on my situation. Perhaps there is more than just brain chemistry at work here."
depressionregimens,fkrpcrs,t1_fkrok4m,1584473360.0,"Well its been about a week like you said but so far I am seeing sustained modest improvements that don't seem to be the result of anything else at this time since nothing has really changed. However, you do make a good point that it's only been about a week since I started this. I will have to try to take a bit of break sometime in the future to see if there is a difference. It may get worse again but that is ok since this is something that I can pick up again so I am not too worried! It si better than doing nothing at this point though hoenstly haha. Anything to help!"
depressionregimens,fkrkmst,t1_fkrkdiw,1584470720.0,"I gave it a try. Made me really mad, anxious and ultimately more depressed after a month of taking it. I think that I am going to try and go off medication for awhile and really put some effort into getting outside, meditating, working out and finding a part time job right now. It is going to be difficult but I am going to really put in some effort to work through everything and not let my mental health stop me."
Anxiety,fkpa8t4,t3_fjobz7,1584405349.0,Literally me. I've gone pretty much my entire life completely caged by my inability to communicate via text or post because of my need for perfection and anxiety over what other people will think. I will type a response or text but can't send it because I keep going over it ang changing it or editing it. Then I eventually give up. Or I will look at it and think it sounds weird so I wont send it. I've spent up to half an hour trying to send a two sentence text only to delete it because I was getting too frustrated.
benzorecovery,fkp9zh1,t3_fjlh2g,1584405175.0,I need to give this a try! Currently struggling with the lingering effects of benzo withdrawal from a few months ago. Also another strong one for me is mindfulness meditation! 30 minutes a day helps tremendously.
depressionregimens,fkp8wva,t3_fjr64y,1584404467.0,"From my understanding the atypical antipsychotics work on the serotonin system turning on, off or partially on different subreceptors. Each of those receptors have a specific function and from what I believe help ameliorate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, this also helps with depression as well. They also act on the dopamine and other receptors which may help with anxiety, panic, and OCD. In summary they work blocking or modulating the dopamine and serotonin system to help lift depression. 

With my personal experience, they do work depending on which ones. Rexulti (which is the successor to Abilify) worked suprisingly well for all of my symptoms. Unfortunately it caused severe impulse control problems. Seroquel helped a bit with my depression and anxiety but caused massive weight gain and slowed my thinking down as well as causing severe sedation. Risperdal helped my OCD tendencies but caused slowing of my cognition and short term memory issues. Vryler mellowed me out but caused extreme restlessness. Zyprexa just caused me to become a slow....very slow zombie. Again these are all personal experiences at varied dosages so please take that into account. 

All in all, atypical antipsychotics are helpful but, at least in my case, cause horrible unwanted side effects which completely outweigh the positives. I am not a doctor but as someone who has went through the healthcare system for severe OCD, depression and crippling anxiety of all sorts, antipsychotics cause much more harm than good. In my unprofessional opinion, I believe that they should only be used for psychotic disorders as the huge amount of side effects can cause permanent issues. For example, I still have a slowed metabolism because of antipsychotics and my cognition is faulty as well. Now I cannot conclude that this is due to the medication but it is suspicious that I now have these problems after taking antipsychotic medications."
alcoholicsanonymous,fko5bcz,t1_fko56uo,1584380397.0,The majority of the time I can limit myself to a few drinks or just sip and I am fine. However there is this weird urge to drink alcohol that comes out of the blue.
benzorecovery,fkkoms6,t1_fkkoemt,1584288669.0,"Thanks. It's just so difficult because now I am in this position where I am asking myself ""Did I have this much anxiety before benzos?"" Then I say well maybe I need this medication and should be on it for the rest of my life. Then I take it and am like no it definitely seems like my brain is not done healing from the damage caused by this medication. 

Thanks so much though! I needed to hear that. Hopefully my anxiety and brain can come back to what they were before benzos."
depressionregimens,fkipx71,t1_fkiorpt,1584225825.0,Oh sorry I meant to say drink alcohol. Not water
depressionregimens,fkipsp5,t1_fkik0yl,1584225740.0,Makes sense. Maybe my brain is getting some mixed signals from the Klonopin or something. It's odd because usually I drink and am able to control myself without the urge to indulge the next day. I'm typically fine. But I just started to take this medication and then suddenly my brain wants alcohol. Very odd and a bit scary. Definitely not going to take this medication again. Hopefully the cravings will subside soon.
depressionregimens,fkiisbd,t1_fkif7pd,1584220993.0,I was thinking the same thing. Good bye sweet cheeses.
depressionregimens,fkhdsph,t1_fkgqeia,1584196324.0,I'd take habit forming over being nonfunctional and suffering all day.
depressionregimens,fkhdqcp,t1_fkh6vlk,1584196276.0,Yes. I was trying to give Trintellix time to work because it not only helped my depression but really allowed me to focus and remember things a lot better. Also improved my attention. So much so that I don't think I needed my ADD medication. However it made my anxiety so bad that I constantly felt like I was going to die. Although I'm sort of like that already. Well I will ask him again if I can restart it.
depressionregimens,fkf91eh,t1_fjt4uqw,1584129417.0,"I've always wondered about that. If there is a bipolar aspect to my depression. However, I've been on the mood stabilizers before and I have not noticed much of an effect. I think its more likely that I just have a lot of anxiety and whenever I am put on SSRIs they exacerbate my anxiety. I'm not too sure honestly and I am afraid that my options are limited. 

I tried pretty much everything under the sun in terms of medicine so I am at a standstill. I am going to switch my psych because I feel like I don't mesh well with this one. 

On the TCA note, I am completely horrified to take TCAs becuase of their side effect profile. For some reason i really want the help and I know that medication can help but every time I go to get put on something I freak out about the side effects and just can't do it anymore. I spend all my time researching endless about the side-effects, thinking about them, watching antipsychiatry videos etc. 

It is almost like a split in my personality. One side wants help and really wants to listen to the doctor's then this other side just freaks out about the side effects no matter what medication it is and makes me stop taking them.

Life is hard right now and I am trying to see what my options are. I just got a new job and interviewed and everything without having any medications. I am actually super proud of myself that someone accepted me and wants me to work somewhere even though I thought I was a nervous and depressed mess. Maybe things aren't as bad as they appear...at least on the outside."
depressionregimens,fjom1dx,t1_fjolsmj,1583530480.0,Oh wow actually I'm having the exact same issues. Sometimes I look at things at they start to bubble or breath or something. I'm not like hallucinating but it's really weird and sort of freaks me out. I'm also pretty detached and super anxious all the time. I'm not too sure what to do. I'm pretty sure being on all these medications might've messed something up with my brain.
depressionregimens,fjojxhv,t1_fjojkly,1583529251.0,"Yeah that's the thing. I gave up on meds for about a year because I literally tried pretty much all of them. I tried pretty much all the SSRI/SNRIs including Lexapro, most of the atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepine, mood stabilizers, pretty much everything the doctor had to throw at me. They either didn't work or had too many side effects. I'm sort of at the end of my rope here. I even tried Ketamine and TMS. 

I'm honestly thinking of just giving it a month of no psychiatric medications what so ever and see if things improve. I don't feel the same after being on so many medications. 

I have no clue where to go from here."
depressionregimens,fjoiwpw,t1_fjoipqs,1583528657.0,"Darn. That's a shame too. For the first time in my life I was starting to get into a routine, was doing well on some interviews and enjoyed life. That damn anxiety though was killer. Also I pretty much barely ate. When I didn't take it, I ate so much the day after. The anxiety is still there though. Hopefully it will get better"
antidepressants,fismm62,t1_fisme1s,1582687945.0,Yeah I took my BP today and it was 103/70. Not sure if that's too low or not or could explain some of my symptoms. I take magnesium nightly for the palpitations however after looking at the interactions I'm not sure if that was a good idea.
antidepressants,firqijh,t1_firq5ih,1582669453.0,"Yes i agree. The side effects are due to the medication since I've been on it before and the same thing has happened. I thought maybe I was just worrying too much so I contacted my psych and he decided to restart the medication yet here I am suffering the same debilitating side effects as before. 

The thing is this though. Ok yes the side effects are unpleasant but if they are not dangerous why should I worry. However that's the problem with me...are they dangerous? I have no clue and that's what scares me and us making me stop the medication. Although my doctors suggest otherwise I am too worried about the symptoms to continue"
DrugNerds,firq3w7,t1_firpp87,1582669237.0,"Yes I've seen a few studies saying the same. Unfortunately the health anxiety, which is the main reason for the prescribing the medication, seems to be winning at this point. I was thinking about giving it another couple of weeks but my anxiety is telling me that I'm going to be one of the first ones to have a life threatening cardiac event from the medication despite having a thorough workup prior to receiving the medication. 

Welp, struggling with an anxiety disorder is very difficult and irrational I suppose. Maybe I'll have a change of heart (No pun intended)"
antidepressants,firlpwq,t1_firlie4,1582666772.0,"Yea I'm getting similar feelings. Except I also feel a bit weak or faint. I told my psychatrist but he doesn't believe it's related and my therapist believes its anxiety.

I agree though I'm thinking of discontinuing as well."
DrugNerds,firipfi,t1_firidch,1582665145.0,"Darn I wish I can get a more clear answer on the topic so I can determine whether my palpitations and faint feelings while starting this medication are due to the heart or anxiety. 

I try to argue with myself that if this medication did produce arrhythmias that it would've been caught either in clinical trials or practice. 

Any thoughts on that?"
DrugNerds,firgc7s,t1_firfyet,1582663860.0,"Interesting. Well I hope that time will tell whether or not this medication has adverse cardiovascular events. Hopefully I am not in deep water here.

HealthAnxiety,fi6mmiy,t1_fi62nii,1582201229.0,It's always when I'm just sitting around not doing anything or at home. It feels like I can't take a deep breath or my oxygen isn't getting to my lungs. It's comparable to a drowning feeling or that feeling you get if you wear an uncomfortable tight shirt or something. It's really distressing. Whenever I go to the hospital or the doctors though it clears up by then and my oxygen saturation looks good. They all think it may just be anxiety.

Again the doctor isn't worried and was reluctant to get an ultrasound. Hopefully it is nothing to stress about

ClotSurvivors,fhzc9xl,t1_fhzc47y,1581995853.0,Oh ok that helps a little. I was wondering a bit more like one day you were able to go for a run and be fine then the next day you felt like you couldn't breath. Then a day after you were back to running again.
ClotSurvivors,fhydpnm,t1_fhyd6me,1581973842.0,"The problem is that they keep on writing it off as anxiety. I've had this shortness of breath for about 5 months now and everytime I go there they always say that it is just anxiety and there is nothing to worry about. I even asked them if they think it is a blood clot and they said no it isn't. 

Then about a week ago my ankle was a bit tight. No one I showed it to said it was swollen so I just wrote it off as my mind playing tricks on me. Then three days after it goes away but I still keep having this occasional shortness of breath. 

I am honestly not sure if I should keep going to the hospital and if it is appropiate to demand that they do more testing to rule out a clotting issue."

It's not like hyperventilating more like hypoventilating. Like I can't breath. All the doctors say it's just anxiety but in not convinced and am not too sure where to go from here. I have an appointment next month with the lung doctor but I'm worried about the time between then."
HealthAnxiety,fho478b,t1_fho3zd0,1581740907.0,Thanks. Although the headache isn't that big of a deal I don't know whether or not I should get this checked out or not or if this is just a symptom of my hypochondria. I know that you can't really recommend anything but again I don't have anyone to bounce this off of and am really unsure so I don't think that it could hurt.
HealthAnxiety,fhkv1g4,t1_fhkuvaa,1581691731.0,No that's the thing. It was only one ankle but I literally asked everyone around me and they all said that it didn't look swollen and they don't know what I'm talking about. But it did feel tight so I'm not sure what to do honestly
HealthAnxiety,fhk2prf,t3_f3n7hm,1581664240.0,"I'm mot a doctor but what I learned with health anxiety for those who already live an unhealthy lifestyle, such I used to, that it is a warning sign. 

I believe a second opinion would be valuable considering your situation however I believe it's important that you stop the stimulant use completely and start a healthy lifestyle.
 
Maybe today it will be anxiety but sometime down the road things may take a turn for the worse. Of course I cannot predict that and I don't know your situation but I think your anxiety is telling you to make positive changes in your life.

Anxiety can be helpful at times. Keep us updated! Best of luck"
HealthAnxiety,fhk2gir,t3_f3ar80,1581663935.0,"Wow, I had to reread the post to see if this was made by me. I literally am going through the same exact thing and to be honest I wish I had the answer but unfortunately I don't. I can offer support though because I am literally currently going through the exact same thing as we speak. I've been having all of these weird symptoms like chest pain, arm pain, can't breath, heart palpitations. I've visited the doctors and went to the ER several times but every time I was sent back saying that it was just anxiety. I'm still not fully convinced. Honestly my belief is that after doing this for some time I'll just burn out and say f*** it and stop obsessing over it. That's just my opinion. Medication can be useful although my problem, as I'm sure is yours, are the side effects. Either real or imagined.

I'm sure we will get through it though!"
HealthAnxiety,fh5oidx,t1_fh5mhxl,1581290920.0,No it's true. For some reason I want a diagnosis. It's almost like I'm looking for a medical issue so that I can feel better. Not too sure if there is a subconscious reasoning behind it or not. I hope it resolves. This has been happening ever since I was taken off diazepam.
HealthAnxiety,ffgqeab,t1_ffgq5du,1579912407.0,Thanks so much! Hopefully I will someday. I will keep pushing forward despite my fears and find peace of mind one day.
HealthAnxiety,ffgptgh,t1_ffgpj4r,1579911993.0,"Yes, i've given that a try but I typically don't have enough energy to even clean up my room, do the dishes, or just get out of bed most days. So after a few days of trying it I just get so overwhelmed."
HealthAnxiety,ffgp466,t1_ffgo9ej,1579911499.0,"It Well I keep getting these random pains in my chest and left arm combined with a hard heart beat, odd heart beats, and random squeezing sensations. Sometimes this escalates to a full blown major panic attack where my heart starts pounding really hard and super fast. In these moments I am convinced i'm dying and call the ambulance only to realize that it was a panic attack.

Its not that I don't trust doctors its more like well what if they missed something? What if there was something that changed just before I got to the doctors office that would've been pivotal in a diagnosis? All of this happens as soon as I get out of the office or er or whatever.

Thanks on the advice for the propananol. Well the thing is that it is a once a day formulation and the doctor said it is a low dose. It honestly has worked wonders to help with the hard heart beats. I guess it wont kill me....but what if the doctor had missed something is all.

I go to therapy and so far it has helped part of my OCD (Pretty much all my anxiety is caused or fueled by OCD type symptoms) but the health anxiety is so heard to defeat becuase it is there everyday. 

I live with my heart beating in my chest and it is always there so there is no way I can get a break from experiencing it. 

I will give a call to my doctor on Monday. I am pretty sure he is getting enough of me considering I saw him like 4 or 5 times in the past few months but i need the reassurance."
HealthAnxiety,fdilzl2,t1_fdilsgy,1578445879.0,"I know but it's always something different with me and I know it seems ridiculous but the little voice in my head is saying 'Oh no but this is symptom 1 of *insert horrible disease problem found through searching symptoms on the internet*. In your experience and personal opinion...if there is something actually wrong, would I know it without a doubt? Or do actual serious illness present symptoms that are ambiguous."
Anxiety,fdcj4js,t1_fczk4ov,1578276177.0,"Wow I didn't know there was someone else in the same position who actually got through it. Typically I tend to research things to death (no pun intended). Like I'll look up famous actors who had heart attacks due to drug use or the rate of death from smoking or something similar and it will just throw me into a whirlwind of fear and panic. Glad to know there is someone who's been through it, I'm sure there are others as well haha."
Anxiety,fdcipzy,t1_fczpj7j,1578275894.0,"I know but the symptoms just keep switching up on me. For example, today my legs and limbs felt heavy sort of like bricks while I was having palpitations. That's sort of new and freaked me out. I really wanted to go to the hospital but since I just got back from there yesterday for a similar problem I tried to just wait it out. I still sort of feel out of it. 

Did you know for certain there was something wrong with your heart? Like was it like oh shit yeah this is definitely for sure a heart attack or did it feel just like anxiety?

Typically with my symptoms im always uncertain. It's like I THINK I could feel my heart or I THINK I could feel my limbs becoming heavy but it never really pans out to anything when I get it checked out."
Anxiety,fdbroiq,t1_fd0ksum,1578260984.0,"I just went yesterday and they ran some tests including an EKG and said that everything looked perfect and given my condition it's likely that it's just anxiety. However they said to check with my doctor on Monday because I was experiencing some weakness that they didn't know what to attribute to. 

I'm having the same thing happen to me right now and am fighting off the urge to run to the hospital again. It would be the 3rd time this week I look for emergency help if I go. Just trying to remind myself that everything is ok. 

I'm really grateful for the article you shared. I reference it often and it calms me down. Hopefully I'll get through this episode with little trouble."
OCD,fa0ol4v,t3_e7fhyt,1575758052.0,"Yup, that's about right. Knowing and trying to move forward and act rational but being completely torn apart and hyper focused on the horrible things in the past. It personally speaks more to my Pure O. ie I have to keep checking with my past to make sure that something horrible hasn't happened or will happened. A lot of reassurance seeking and knowing that I need to move on but I just can't."
benzorecovery,f8d9m7b,t1_f8d9iqo,1574482566.0,Ah makes sense. I have OCD and it is one of my obessions. I tend to get way into the side effects of my medications. I thought I had serotonin syndrome from my 50mg dose of pristiq or cardiac arrest from my ADHD. Probably something I should work through with my therapist.
benzorecovery,f8d8dup,t1_f8d4dv3,1574481435.0,"Yeah I agree. Perhaps I should get into some sort of consistency and talk to a doctor about it. I definitely notice huge ups and downs when trying to wean off the medication by just taking it intermediately. 

Long story short the doctor thought my anxiety was so severe that it wouldn't be a good fit. Also I don't follow directions. Like I would take my meds then not take them then restart them. 

I basically did that though because the side effects were way too much but after trying to get off them I couldn't so I had to get back on them. After awhile it just became a mess. 

Yeah I will have to talk to a doctor next week about it but for now, i'll see how I do without it. I feel a lot more anxious but I notice some triggers. Some huge ones for me are sugar, coffee, even tea. Give myself some to recover but definitely need to get a doc on board asap.

The funny thing is that I am tired and sleepy all the time and don't have like tremors or anything like that like what other people describe. But the panic, nervousness, and my OCD are in full swing. Also a lot of agoraphobia Fml lol"
benzorecovery,f8cuyxo,t1_f8ctq3r,1574470082.0,"Yeah definitely sounds horrible. Well, I will give a call to find a new psych at the start of this upcoming week and if anything gets too overwhelming I'll give a call to the ER....for the 6th time lol.

Thanks!"
benzorecovery,f8csz0o,t1_f8cspsl,1574468474.0,"Wow that sounds like hell. That is a bit surprising since it is such a low dose of Klonopin. Yeah I know the only problem is actually standardizing it since I barely used it and I went 8 days without it and was fine but then had a full blown panic attack and started it again. So honestly just really confused  haha. I don't mind tolerating the withdrawal symptoms as long as I don't have a seizure.

I need to get into contact with a new psych. Ever consider tapering off the Klonopin? I'm sure you can do it!"
OCD,f5swkrs,t3_dozyu4,1572444973.0,Honestly the thought that I don't have OCD scares the crap out of me because that might mean all the thoughts inside my head might be actually true or happening.
OCD,f5rr1tc,t3_dorby8,1572400903.0,lol basically me.
benzorecovery,f5rqcnb,t1_f5m15w6,1572400446.0,Yup! Definitely am! A lot of what was happening was my OCD returning back to haunt me but I found out that the more I get outside and the more I spend some of my brain energy the better my symptoms get. Like earlier today I was certain I would have a seizure but instead of looking it up online I went to play pool with a friend and everything got much better. It is still a huge struggle but I am coping better than before. Thank you so much though for checking back in. I hope all is well with you!
benzorecovery,f5ji3il,t1_f5jh0dd,1572229179.0,Oh God thank you. I suffer from OCD and its hard to tell the difference when the lines are so obscured between what is real and what isn't. Like oh shit is this it? Am I going to have a seizure in the middle of class and embaress myself? Then all these thoughts rush into my head of me convulsing and then my heart rate ramps up and I run out of class or the bus. That's reassuring though. Thank you!
afinil,f4t5lwl,t1_f4t51pi,1571784278.0,"I am not a professional but from my understanding i was drinking in moderation like a 2-3 beverages every other day but the thing is I don't typically have cravings for alcohol. It didn't make my hangover worse but I can tell you that it 100% made my anxiety worse which is why I am considering just self medicating my ADHD with coffee or getting back on my normal meds, or just taking the brunt of it for the semester and wing it. Not sure but I don't think anafinils are for me.

Just was curious about other's experience"
afinil,f4t44lc,t1_f4t3xsx,1571783871.0,That is true but I was just curious if anyone else had any similar experience with this.
OCD,f3w6om6,t1_f3w3po0,1571193327.0,Thanks for the reassurance. It is hard sometimes when I get lost in the weeds. You are not just a random redditor on the internet there is a person behind the screen. Thank you very much I appreciate it
ADHD,f3vm3xb,t1_f3sx8m3,1571179251.0,"I've tried Effexor. Helped with OCD but I wouldn't sleep, had too much energy and wasn't able to focus on my shcool. Same thing with Cymbalta."
OCD,f34vkz7,t1_f34u3of,1570661769.0,"Medical marijuana, with the right strain was God send for me when I lived in a state where it was legal. Unfortunately though at college in this state they don't allow it. Also would you happen to know what the observable difference would be in medical marijuana vs valium? 

I have to interact with people a lot and I don't want people noticed that I am high but then again I am not sure if someone would know if I am on Valium either. That's probably the only hangup. Any experience with that?"
OCD,f34rxd7,t1_f34rmmi,1570659261.0,"I've tried Ketamine infusion already and although ti did work well for my depression and social anxiety (actually extradornarlly well lol) it did nothing for my OCD. The bodly sensations are the worse. Every little movement in my body or feeling is a sign of a heart attack or seizure and half the time I don't even know if they are real feelings or if i'm just generating them myself. 

I agree with the risk of dependence. I will give it a few days and perhaps this will pass. Yeah GABA-A receptors are vey touchy and adapt way to quickly. Especially to high strength short acting benzos like alprazolam. Although they are effective short term, I wonder if anyone out there had experience with long term treatment."
OCD,f0wj0qx,t1_f0vic1v,1569008349.0,"Literally me! Then when someone says that I am weird I have this 'aha!' moment! Confirmation bias I suppose haha. 

Honestly though, the feeling that I am stupid and weird has limited me and held me back so much in life. It's pretty severe. I hope things get better for you!"
OCD,f0wiujq,t3_d6t91z,1569008270.0,"I don't personally but I know that my sister does. She always says, like how can I trust you? Or she has the same feelings that they have done horrible things as. I don't really get it but I always have the feeling that i've done horrible things and am beyond the pale.

Hang in there! Nothing is as bad as it seems! If this is really OCD then I am sure reassurance will only further deepen the issue. One thing that I've found helpful in these situations is simple yet difficult: Just do something new and engaging. Like go for a walk, talk to a friend, workout, maybe something productive to distract yourself.

Best of luck!"
OCD,f0n0qub,t1_f0l5m57,1568757591.0,"Haha it's ok! I'm sure things will pan out. As for me though it seems hard to keep my head up at times considering the complexity and complete contradictions of my diagnosis.

Honsetly just looking for a solid and sustainable treatment plan. 

Either way, glad to know that there are others out there like me. However, I do have to ask...does it ever seem to get lonely being so different? 

I feel very alone in the sense that other people seem to find me very odd, different or weird and I am certain that it has to do with my mental health issues. Yet I can't seem to find similar people anywhere. Such an oddity. 

Oh well!"
OCD,f0n0i0t,t1_f0kyifs,1568757421.0,"Will do! I was evaluated by a clinical psychologist and was diagnoised with ADHD and OCD as well as a hint of some sensory processing disorder but the current treatment doesn't seem to help. I am just wondering if there is an alternative explanation for my cluster of symptoms.

Thank you for the input."
OCD,f0n0cuf,t1_f0mzjww,1568757323.0,"No worries at all I appreciate you sharing your story. Yeah, some things don't really seem to fit with me. I just find it a bit coincidental that I was diagnosed with OCD and ADHD yet the majority of the medications have provided little relief of my symptoms with agrevating the others. In addition, it seems like I have some sort of auditory processing disorder as well which can play into my ADHD at times. However, I haven't been to the neurologist as was recommended by doctor because 'I didn't have time' (I actually just keep saying that i'll do it tomorrow but its been quiet awhile haha. I'll just take a look at your book recommendation though! 

&#x200B;

Thank you again!"
ADHD,exs3uis,t3_cu04iy,1566531512.0,"Happens to me all the time. I sort of have to catch it while it happens then readjust myself to the task at hand. Also I read this article on how we can burn through our executive functions like attention very quickly. The author advised breaks, positive motivational statements, and (ironically) sports drink with sugar to provide the brain with the glucose necessary to activate our attention areas of the brain."
DSPD,exs35fr,t1_ewwb2yr,1566530937.0,"Yeah I definitely agree! About 100-200mg of modafinil very early in the morning helps. However my pesky anxiety disorder which makes it already difficult to leave the house becomes 10x worse. Depending on how bad the anxiety is that day, I might just end up hiding inside thinking I might die haha but usually if I can muster up the strength to leave the house im fine. 

I was thinking of just taking such a small dose but honestly it makes my OCD so bad. Stuck between a rock and a hard place haha. Welp starting school this upcoming week and am going to try to make it by with my Ritalin and hopefully a doctor to help with the sleep disorder."
ADHD,ewu2onp,t3_cptx32,1565761983.0,"I have to agree with the first post. This definitely seems more like a symptom of depression. What i've noticed is that ADHD is not neurotic like depression or anxiety. With my ADHD, I am actually a really happy, bubbly, joyful type of guy who enjoys being around people. I have difficulties in a lot of areas most of us have, like attention and forgetfulness, but it definitely doesn't make me depressed. I just can't remember thinks as well as others or come off as odd or different while socializing. If I like something, then I REALLY like something but if I don't then I can't really bother with it. Sounds like you are losing enjoyment in things that you used to enjoy which is definitely a sign of depression. Now this can be because of your ADHD putting a lot of stress on you or other factors and genetic predispositions you have. I'd definitely suggest talking to a therapist or your doctor about this. Doesn't really seem like ADHD to me.

Best of luck! Things get better, they always do :)"
OCD,etghs0a,t3_cbizz1,1562791270.0,"OMG me too! This literally happened once at college! I was at a party and for the first time as a freshman in college and smoked some of the devils lettuce. When the night was over I went home woke up and a thought popped in my head. 'What if someone took a picture of me and posted it somewhere online!?' I sorta freaked out and couldn't stop thinking that all day. I felt like I needed to do something so I found my friend who went with me the night we went out and he assured me that no one took a picture of me smoking weed. This reassurance really helped me but it was sort of temporary as I searched facebook endlessly to see if there were any pictures of the event. 

In reality though I worried myself sick for a week or too and needed to confirm or deny this false belief with hard facts. It was way over blown but now years have passed I can look back at it and laugh"
