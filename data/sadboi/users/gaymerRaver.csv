so we had new neighbours few years ago, they ripped their flooring up, and put wooden flooring down (against their own tenancy agreement)

my ceeiling in the bedroom is cracking all over the place, it‚Äôs all wonky now.

to further investigation, our ceeiling isnt at the specirication on paper (meaning the builders didn't do the job on paper,properly)

she lives on a 2 floor maisonette and we live in a flat. Hear everything when she comes thumping down like an elephant at 7:50AM because she smells weed from somewhere (not my problem when we are asleep so don‚Äôt make it my problem) their washing machine has shaken our doors,radiators and the window frame to which I have videoed for use on later days. ‚Äî  My partner has lived here for 15 years so has a great understanding of neighbours different patterns above him, and it‚Äôs never been like this

no one wanted to do anything about it, housing manager (ex shall I say) made some highly inappropriate comments and I had enough at that point so the ombudsman are investigating the internal issues. So far head of environmental and the housing manager were ‚Äúdemoted to non customer roles‚Äù (I fucking wonder why???)

we have legal aid help for it, but obviously since the outbreak that‚Äôs made things much harder.

epping forest district council are dickheads, but so is my neighbour. I have PTSD (diagnosed) and the constant trigger has 100% harmed me as lack of sleep, self harm because I cannot cope with this on my own with the flashbacks at the same time, failing exams countless times since it‚Äôs all happened (didnt fail exams before like this) I also started punching walls (unprecedented for me) just kinda triggers me a bit. I used to play piano (classical) when I was younger, I‚Äôd love to get back into it one day, but punching walls will not get me there when my knuckles hurt because I can‚Äôt twist my hand going up/down an octave.

It‚Äôs gonna be a long arse process given the outbreak. We reckon when they first created these flats they run out of money and did a botched job on our flat as the ceiling isn‚Äôt consistent throughout the block even though they were all built the same year, but who knows, all speculation and stuff."
