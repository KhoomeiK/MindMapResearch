stopsmoking,fbxqw6z,t3_eezsjb,1577197996.0,"2 months locked in a psych ward with ""smoke breaks"" being the only reason to get yard time."

bipolar,fbdx6v3,t1_fbc9z8z,1576773344.0,I love this and agree I want to be part of reducing the stigma. The government policy Five Year Forward talks about Paid peer support in the industry I'm looking at. Unfortunately my gut is going with everyone who said don't. In this case I legally have to disclose my disability to Occupational Heath who will then inform my manager so they'll find out within weeks of hiring me if I get the job.
bipolar,fbbwhha,t1_fb93com,1576709694.0,Better. I tried enough combinations that didn't work to know what does and what side effects I'm willing to work with and which I'm not. I made the decisions this time around and my care team ate giving me a lot of say in how much and when to increase/decrease my dosage.  It helps.
AmItheAsshole,fb7z3qz,t3_ebwkoe,1576602595.0,I'm a nurse and do weird shifts. I got a daylight alarm to wake me up without waking my other half (the light doesn't bother him). And my Fitbit alarm buzzes silently on my wrist as a back up.  I'm gonna go with NAH because I know how difficult it is to wake up at stupid o'clock.
bipolar,fb7yni0,t3_eby62f,1576602309.0,Took me 11yrs :/
BipolarReddit,faek0be,t3_e8nnxq,1576002352.0,"I think I'm lucky.  My partner of 7+ years is ex army,  has his own issues with depression and occasionally substances.  We make a great couple.  When he's down I switch into caretaker mode and when I'm nuts he's an angel. 
Look after each other.  You'll be fine."
BipolarReddit,f9u822u,t3_e6znet,1575646073.0,Yes. Yes. And yes. It's disgustingly wintery here and that's the best response I can come up with till the antiDs kick in.
schizophrenia,f92fgph,t3_e3bexb,1575028597.0,"I always wondered why shadowy dark cloaked figures in top/ boulder hats are so common.  I've got a regular who comes in various shades of detail who seems to crop up in movies and shows.  Old Georgie in cloud atlas, the ghost with the cane in The Haunting remake series.  He's everywhere."
nursing,f90zp4u,t1_f90hjkx,1574979859.0,"It wouldn't be comfortable if that was the only income,  and if you needed to pay for childcare it would be very difficult."
AmItheAsshole,f8z85a4,t3_e2x5dm,1574958086.0,"YTA. You said a natural colour, then changed the game on her.  Unfair."
BipolarReddit,f8z6qiu,t3_e2zfz3,1574957532.0,"Yes. Bad. 
But a small dose of 5htp and a large dose of Bvitamins dose wonders.  I can't take SSRIs at all in an outpatient setting so had to get creative."

BipolarReddit,f7dziyw,t3_dvnp8c,1573638481.0,Yes please.
AmItheAsshole,f6pth48,t3_dsi2jj,1573063909.0,YTA. It's people like you who make work life crap.
schizophrenia,f5ykc24,t3_dps5qt,1572557507.0,State dependent memory... a psych told me that once when I asked why my memory of certain episodes sucked.
schizophrenia,f5yjqfq,t3_dpl40b,1572557248.0,Yeah but in my case I think it's the meds. Higher dose=worse dreams.
BipolarReddit,f52ibz8,t3_dmmiwb,1571950597.0,"I have a really strict diet. I'm coeliac so that helps. No carbs after 6pm (stops the carb binge when I've taken my meds). No food upstairs. It's hard,  the cravings are intense but I haven't gained more than 4-5lb."
BipolarReddit,f52flkz,t3_dmf9xp,1571949943.0,Loud fecking music that I sing out loud and dance to like... well a crazy person. That's probably my very first warning sign.
BipolarReddit,f31v0ar,t1_f2minjl,1570585487.0,Definitely.  Your evidence base is anecdotal and the few references you have are poor quality and sensationalised. Ben Goldacre eat your heart out.
BipolarReddit,f2jhrs7,t1_f2jh4k8,1570272731.0,"But hey chemo causes cancer, stem cell transplants have a very good chance of killing you, radiation therapy causes burns that never heal.  Would you rather stick with the cancer?"
BipolarReddit,f2jhlqb,t1_f2jba4f,1570272662.0,"Sorry meant to add that too mine
 May be the brain damage."
BipolarReddit,f2jh4k8,t3_ddl0go,1570272462.0,"All the alternatives aren't an option with me. But quetiapine is amazing.  I feel great, stable, have actually lost a stone in the last year. I'm motivated, working, have a sex drive, and no episodes no hospital admissions in two years.  There is literally nothing else that works so please  don't try telling me the alternatives are better."
EatingDisorders,f27ljz1,t3_dca606,1570040923.0,"My therapy is based on teaching me how not to be a perfectionist and a control freak.  I relapse like clockwork when life becomes unstable and things are out of my control.  For me, it's not about weight. I know I look and feel sick when I'm  underweight but it's not about that."
