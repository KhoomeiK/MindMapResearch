In the past two months however I’ve lost like 35 lbs and counting by entering a caloric deficit and it seems to be the only way where I’m still satisfied with what I eat while still consistently losing weight. 

A caloric deficit is basically consuming less calories than the energy you waste in a day and they’re are calculators for this online. For example, according to my weight, my sedentary lifestyle (not rlly exercising), and how much my goal is to lose a week my caloric deficit is to consume 1,500 calories a day. Which sounds like it’s not much but I honestly never even hit 1,500 a day even though I eat and get full and satisfied. If you exercise, then obviously that number will be higher since you are wasting more energy so your body needs more calories to maintain healthy. I’d definitely suggest looking into it.

I’d also like to add, that I have PCOS which also makes it increasingly difficult to lose weight and keep it off, but since I been doing this it’s been staying off."

I think they need to be reminded that you, the younger one, are stepping up and doing them a *favor* by coming to take care of your mom when you already have your own child to take care of by yourself and that if they can’t find some respect for you and your child you need to end that favor and go back home."

He’s 18, in college, and instead of choosing to go out and party he’s trying to better himself and his health, I’d say that’s the very opposite of acting childish.

From a mother’s perspective I understand that you are worried about him and it being night time makes you agitated but honestly if something bad was going to happen to him it would happen at any time of the day and there’s worse things he could be doing than trying to control his health so I say ease up on him.

I do agree that if the roles were reversed people were most likely going to side with you and encourage you to seek some type of justice. it’s unfortunate that there are still people in this world who don’t understand that men also deserve the decency and chance to consent and revoke consent at anytime and that it does affect them just as much when they feel their consent was violated.

Dietandhealth,fjynwqz,t3_ff7ei1,1583700814.0,"In pounds it’s a little over 4 which is technically a reasonable amount to lose in 2 months. 
Also, the number on the scale doesn’t always accurately show progress. What I mean by that is,  me and another person could both be the same weight on the scale but I might look thinner and healthier than the other person. 

However, the biggest tip to losing weight I can give is for her to make sure she’s eating at a caloric deficit. Meaning to make sure she’s eating less calories than the ones her body is burning daily. If you google a caloric deficit calculator there are lots of websites that can help with that. 
Caloric deficit calculator will determine how many calories her body needs to maintain her current weight then subtract however many calories needed in order to achieve weight loss based off her current weight, how active she is, and how long & fast she wants to reach her goal. 

For example, in order for me to lose 2lbs weekly at my current weight (which I won’t include) and because I currently have a sedentary lifestyle (don’t work out or move much) in order to eat at a caloric deficit I need to eat no more than 1,238 calories daily. If I did work out more, the calorie count would be higher since I’d be burning off more energy.

P.s. if she really feels like she’s trying her hardest and is still not losing weight then maybe getting a cortisol or thyroid test would be the next steps to see if there’s a medical reason why it’s hard for her body to lose weight. 

Hope this helps!"

I’m not Mexican but I am hispanic and I know how harsh Hispanics can be also, how easily they claim it’s “endearing” or just “jokes” when someone tries to call them out on it. Making jokes about you being white is not Mexican culture lmao so you should not feel bad for feeling uncomfortable at their constant taunting. It seems pretty clear that they just have a problem with you not being the same ethnicity. 

I wouldn’t say you should take it so personal as had you been a black woman they probably would have had a problem with that too, but I also do think that as your in-laws of 3 years they should be understanding of your feelings and if they cared about you they shouldn’t have a problem with not saying things that make you uncomfortable. 

As for your man, I understand the being called “chubby” all too well, in my family everyone calls me “gorda” (fat) even when i lost all the weight. And when I was younger I kinda let it slide but as I got older I wanted it to stop and any person I’d try to get to understand why it made me uncomfortable they did the same thing your in-laws did. Gaslight me. Flip it on me, get offended that I didn’t understand them, call me sensitive, and always made me feel like I was the asshole for wanting some respect. Now, I do as your man and just let it slide because I knew it was a fight I couldn’t win. 

However, that doesn’t mean I don’t still cringe Everytime I hear it or that it didn’t affect how I viewed myself growing up hearing those “endearing” fat jokes and it doesn’t make them any less wrong for using gaslighting as a tactic to manipulate & continuing distasteful dialogue. 

I say next time you go over there, put your foot down. Maybe they’ll be surprised and think you didn’t have it in you. I’d say something along the lines of “listen, I’m not some random white girl and I’m not planning on going anywhere. If you guys actually tried to get to know me maybe you’d see me for me and respect me the same way I respect you. A few jokes here and there are funny but it’s getting old. I want to be able to spend time with you all as a family without being made to feel like I don’t belong here.

While low cholesterol is most often better than high cholesterol again I’d like to say that it’s off by such a small quantity that I wouldn’t even worry enough to change eating habits or anything like that especially since the rest of your bloodwork is writhing normal range. However, things that raise “good” cholesterol are foods such as: olive oil, beans, fatty fish like salmon, chia seeds & flax (could be incorporated into smoothies if you have some or throw on yogurt/ fruit bowls), nuts (to be eaten in moderation), high fiber fruits (apples w the peel, bananas, strawberries, oranges, ect.) 

Not to sound like a broken record lol but again, I wouldn’t make any drastic changes considering the quantities you were off by. I say just definitely drink more water.

EffexorSuccess,fikz42h,t3_f4xdzw,1582490162.0,Have you thought about taking it at night? When I started I took it at night but I felt like what it must feel like to be on a ton of coke so I decided to start taking it earlier in the day instead but if it’s making you drowsy maybe switching it to night time might be better for you

I was feeling so fucking down words can’t even express how done with life I was.. I even cried to my dad that Day, I was ready to kill myself and wanted to go to the hospital for my safety if I didn’t feel better by the next day. I took the pill right before bed, and despite all the terrible side effects I felt the first day I woke up feeling brand new (emotionally) mind you I was nauseous as hell, had a terrible headache, kind of dizzy, and still I felt lighter. I had a blank mind but in a good way. First day in a really long time I woke up and my first thought wasn’t suicidal. It’s been almost a week now and I’m still feeling lighter I hope this feeling stays and I’m glad to hear it’s working in the same way for someone else. I hope it keeps working for you as well!"

I thought it was just the Effexor side effects but I haven’t drank since that day and haven’t felt that way again"

Try to just work on soothing it, and getting swelling down if you have any, wash your face only with cold water, stay hydrated (sounds dumb but very important), ice it from time to time (in hopes that it’s just bruising), and if you’re feeling pain or discomfort take an anti-inflammatory pill like ibuprofen (Advil)"
