“I wonder if I’m not good enough” simply isn’t a thought someone with adequate self-worth or mental health would have in this position. If she valued herself properly, she’d be *furious* for the way she’s being treated or *disgusted* by him.

Clients have my empathy because they’ll never be my competition- they can never be my friends, lovers, or even coworkers. I feel like they believe in me because they keep coming back (they’re not mandated, they always choose) and for choosing me I appreciate them. It’s just me listening and trying to help (using my evidence based tools)- I’m authentic during that time so for them to come back to me after seeing something “real” means a lot. (I tell clients when I don’t know something. Which is hard for me. Everyone else gets bullshitted). Their success is my success. And with all of the professional boundaries in place, it’s easy for me to feel empathy for them because it’s confined and contained. All children have my unconditional empathy, and I don’t care how awfully they behave. I don’t know why, they just do.

I don’t want your love unless I earn it, because when it’s given to me unconditionally it’s as insignificant as a participation trophy. I measure myself in inches, pounds, ribbons, trophies, certificates, degrees, applause, stares and nothing else. I climb and climb, but the higher I get the worse I feel. My hand can slip at any moment, but as time goes on, what will happen if I fall only gets worse and worse. So even when I sit at the top of the mountain, all I can think about what would happen if I fell, and that’s what keeps me up there. I know I’m awful, but I don’t mind because I move so fast that no one can focus on me long enough to notice it. 

I am happy when I’m able to see progress in the clients that other therapists didn’t want to deal with.  I never got better, but I got here. Deep down, I think my client’s unconscious mind knows that I don’t belong on this side of the couch....and I think that they like that. The ecstasy that comes with a manic episode, the inner fire that comes with an anger outburst, the power from manipulating another person, the feeling of invincibility that comes from stealing something- We fear losing these things, and they make us hold on to our mental illness and never want to let them go. 

And I understand that, because I hold on to a piece of mental-illness too. I hold on to self-hatred as tightly as I can, and I’ve held it so close to my heart for so long that it burns in my heart now. But, don’t misunderstand what I’m saying- I am happy. I feel competent, competitive and confident. I like myself because I hate myself. I know as long as that fire is lit, I’ll accomplish more and more. As long as it’s burning me, I’ll keep shedding skins and evolving into something better. If it dies out, I don’t know what I would do. 

Even though they aren’t the same as mine, I know clients have fires like that too. Some therapists try to extinguish those fires, but then what will they be? I refuse to leave anyone’s inner light dimmer than I found it....even if that inner light is a forest fire. So, I assure mine that I won’t do that. Together, we’ll find a new, better material to keep it burning. I’m not afraid to stick my arm in the fire and pull branches out. And, I feel strong enough to pick that new fuel source up and hurl it in, until the old source is all burnt up and the new one keeps the fire alive. 

So, I throw their ecstasy, power, control, and invincibility like a lump of clay on to a potters wheel, and we spin it and shape it until they’re satisfied. My own wheel is jammed, but I’m still a good potter."

mentalillness,ezuqnmi,t1_eztrsr7,1568158886.0,"Thank you :) I think there’s a big difference between sympathy and empathy and I aim to give clients empathy (although there are a few situations in which sympathy is appropriate too). I see sympathy as giving someone a fish, but empathy as giving someone a fish and letting them eat it as you teach them how to catch their own.

I always tell people that I’ll never fully understand or know what they’ve gone through, and I’ll never fully understand how they’re feeling in any moment. But, what I can do is help them to understand it, find peace with it, or work on changing it if they desire. I stay totally honest about what I can and can’t do. I’m Board Certified as a Life Coach with a speciality designation in health and wellness coaching. So, helping people get motivated, healthy, and get “unstuck” is a forte of mine. People who go to the gym a few times a week but want to go more, people who have made some healthy changes but wanna take it to the next level- I’ve got that. But, I’ve never worked with a person who’s had an eating disorder, and I’m totally upfront about that. I have a really strong desire to work with obese individuals. It’s close to my heart, having been obese myself, and having special training in trauma makes me feel like I could help a client in that area (obesity is very frequently linked with trauma at some point). However, I’d tell a client exactly that. And it’s their choice to work with me from there. I’m comfortable with people who are or have been suicidal. Unfortunately, I had those clients thrust upon me at another site (not that it’s unfortunate to work with suicidal individuals in general, it’s unfortunate to be afraid and unsure of your skills but have them as your first clients knowing that if you don’t counsel them, no one will).  If I hadn’t had that experience, I wouldn’t have known I am able to help them efficiently. It’s a hard thing because in order to work with a population, it means you have to counsel some people with issues you’ve never worked with before. But I let them know that. I’ve found that they sometimes really like it. Because the “standard treatments” for their problem hasn’t been stamped into my brain, so (after consulting with other professionals before the session) I’m with them things that the other people they’ve had didn’t do. Like I taught a boy with violent outbursts how to sew and weave. Everyone thought it was crazy (and were like “are you stupid how are you not scared of this kid with a needle”) but him being able to stab, cut and pull the strings hard was really soothing for him. And I think he still sews. I’m (yet) comfortable working with addictions and would make sure that client went to another therapist at the practice. What I do know how to do is cognitive behavioral work, self-esteem work, EMDR (almost - by the time I’m all set up in the office I will), and I’m learning Neurofeedback. But I do agree with you that you gotta tell clients what you know. To not do that is disrespecting them"
mentalillness,ezsgy6y,t1_ezsfbn6,1568091274.0,"Thank you :) I’m happy to hear that you have such a great relationship with the clinician you have found! Im sure your therapist knows that you feel very sorry after calming down- we know that bpd can be like a roller coaster where your emotions are the ride and you’re the passenger strapped in. Even after the ride ends (aka, you’ve calmed down) you can still feel “off”, that’s not your fault and we do understand that (even if we don’t know the full depth to which you feel that). 

I think those statements she’s making could be related. Remember your therapist is a person... it’s possible that she herself is a little uncomfortable saying “I care and I want to help you” to you. I care about my clients a lot, I’d even go so far as to say I love them. (they’re all small children, I think my biological clock is ticking so don’t blame me 😂)Some of them have been in foster care, and there has been 2 or 3 times, Ive bought a MegaMillion ticket after work because if I won, I could afford to adopt them. I’ve daydreamed about my clients being happy, and still, saying I care can be a hard thing for me to say to a client because sometimes, they’re like “no you don’t” and then I (yes, the therapist!) personally feel rejected. 

Why would someone want to be a “good therapist”? It’s likely they want to be a good therapist because they care and want to help you. What would someone who cares and wants to help you in her position do? They’d try to be a good therapist. Just something to think about. 

Im glad to hear that her sharing that helped you. Personal disclosures are something I think very long and hard about. I can’t say I’ve ever done one. I don’t want to tell clients I’ve struggled because I don’t want them to hold back. I feel like if they know what I’ve been through they won’t think I’m strong enough to handle what they throw at me. But, that’s just me 🙃"
mentalillness,ezsfehi,t1_ezsalsv,1568089760.0,"I was actually just at a training for EMDR this past weekend. Im about 1/2 way there as far as learning that goes. With EMDR, the processing you do continues after you leave the office, so you’re probably not going to be able to pinpoint the moment where you feel better. Maladaptive thoughts are in their own little neural network, unattached to anything else. EMDR is supposed to start tying them in to your positive thoughts that are part of your overall network. So once they become linked up and integrated to the positive they lose some of their power. Being tied into the overall network dilutes them in a way. 

All the clinicians at the practice I joined operate from an attachment-style perspective. They’re very in tune to people’s attachment style, and I imagine something like that would be ideal for you. I don’t feel like we got much of that information in grad school, so I’m working on seeking out my own additional training on attachment style. But understanding attachment style is very underrated in the field, I believe. 

One things for sure, I absolutely don’t have a cold or harsh style. i worry that I’m too nice with clients? Is that even a thing? (All my clients have been kids who experienced trauma and I felt like being extremely warm and kind was the only way to get through to them.) I didn’t do anything weird, but I took really careful notes on what they liked and made therapeutic activities special for them. 

[[[Like I had a child client with anger outbursts who was OBSESSED with Easter. So, I would hide anger words in eggs and he’d find them and we’d talk about it. I’d also hide frustrating scenarios in them and we’d act out how to cope. He had issues overacting when others kids annoyed him, so I’d put on this obnoxious hat and pretend to be “the most annoying person ever” and follow him around being annoying and he’d have to cope with it appropriately (asking to stop nicely, tell a teacher for help, belly breathing when you start to feel annoyed, etc)]]]

But the thing I noticed was that being this way made clients want to get to know me. If I didn’t come in 100%, they sensed it and wanted to know how I was feeling (like if I wore less or more make up than normal, they’d ask about it). They wanted I was doing over the weekend, my hobbies, etc. If i checked the time... they were dying to get a glimpse at what my lockscreen was. 

My clients had more interest/curiosity in me as a person than other therapists had, and I don’t think this was good because I felt like they emulated me (or tried to) in a lot of ways? I want them to be the best version of themselves... not a mini-me. To connect (because they were kids) I did share small things about myself in the beginning when asked (I have a pet frog, I like to run outside, my favorite color is pink, etc). When I left my site and transition them to a new therapist, I learned my clients were mean to them and I was shocked. When I left, my clients were genuinely surprised that we couldn’t “be friends” afterwards. They were all told this, but just thought it didn’t apply to them or that I couldn’t possibly mean that. (And I felt terrible, and if it wasn’t totally unprofessional I’d be happy to catch up with them over ice cream and make sure they’re doing okay.) 

I want to build a connection that’s genuine and strong with clients.... but I worry that the connection is too much and they’ll be hurt when they progress enough to not need therapy? But, this connection is what allowed them to make progress in the first place. 

Ugh lol sorry for the word vomit essay, but if you’re not fully comfortable telling your therapist that then it’s probably a good thing. It means there’s some boundaries in place there. The clients who could come tell me EVERYTHING with no reservations or hesitation struggled a lot upon terminating the relationship. I’m NOT saying you shouldn’t tell your therapist that you feel that way- I’m just saying it’s okay for you to be close to a therapist and still be nervous to say some things to them. It means you’re “contained” and clients that are totally uncontainable face a unique set of difficulties. If you do tell her that, she shouldn’t judge you at all, and it could be really helpful for you to work through that with her. She might even know already. I’ve had clients “admit” to me that they felt that way.... but I had already known that because I could sense it. However, as the therapist it is NOT my place to bring that feeling of theirs up. It can make a client feel embarrassed and exposed, so feelings a client has towards a therapist are generally discussed when/if the clients feels ready. I don’t wanna tell you what to do with your therapist- that’s your call. But, feeling a crush like you describe is not unusual, rare or weird in the least. 

But anyways, I apologized for word vomit and then kept going so I’ll stop 😂"

Advice,ezbapzy,t3_d0i13k,1567816941.0,"Having a type can be bad when it becomes a race-related fetish and you’re attracted to the person simply because of their race instead of who they are. 

Example: If you were to take a scroll through my (now deactivated) Bumble, you’d find a lot of black men, so other people would think they’re “my type”. 

If you were to ask me what my type was, I’d say I’m drawn to men who have very muscular builds and are very athletic. I seek out confident men and I’m extremely turned off by men who are quiet or soft-spoken. I also adore guys with really white teeth and my brain fires on all cylinders whenever guys who have a space in between their front teeth smile. In my opinion, a lot of black men I meet fit this description of what I’m drawn to. However, not all black men do. So, I don’t go running after any man who’s black. And I also see men of other races who have the traits I’m looking for. So, (in my single days) I would be open to dating those men as well. 

So, even if all the people you end up dating are the same race, it’s not a bad thing. It just depends on WHY you dated them. 

Dating black men so that you can “have a cute mixed baby”, to anger your family members or just to “try something new” is offensive because you don’t see that man as a unique humanbeing- he’s just a walking race to you. That man (unless he doesn’t care about you) would probably feel objectified if he realized you thought that about him... dating a guy only because of their race is really no different than dating a girl only because she has big boobs (and people can understand why that’s wrong). But, if all your girlfriends just so happen to have knockers and other traits you love them for, then it’s cool"

All of those (the authoritarianism, tribalism, lack of empathy, intolerance, and other basic instincts) don’t always present themselves though. Example: A lot of US veterans don’t have the lack of empathy, but they display the tribalism. It’s documented that in many therapy groups for veterans, the veterans end up giving therapists they find helpful some sort of badge/military item. The significance of the item is to make them an “honorary member” of that tribe. Once that happens the therapy group usually starts to go deeper and makes a lot more progress.

On the surface, you rose above everything and found success, yet it doesn’t feel that way.  I think often we strive for achievements because we think we’ll be happy or feel better once we get there. I think you finished school and got married and “got there” and couldn’t understand why it wasn’t enough to feel better. There’s nothing anyone can accomplish who can make them feel better. That’s all internal that you have to decide you are going to feel better, and then work at it. Feeling better takes as much, if not more work than getting better (if that makes sense.) You’ve accomplished a lot, and sometimes it takes a while for our minds to “catch up” and appreciate all the good we’ve done. If you’ve gotten this far, I have NO DOUBT that in time you’ll reach the happiness you want to ❤️"
TheHandmaidsTale,exhpnnt,t1_exhh8yr,1566311172.0,"I haven’t read much research about parents who were murdered. I had been researching the topic when it pertained to a client, but it was different because the client had lost a father due to gang activity. If one parents was murdered by the other I imagine that would be very confusing for the child and open the door to a lot more complicated issues. 

These boys are in a difficult situation, but aren’t in a situation that would damage them like children of Gilead. (Those kids often see their parents die in front of them, are beaten, forced into rigid routines, see violence every day, can’t express themselves, etc.) By age 3 and 5, they’re bonded to their parents and that’s a difficult loss....but at the same time the children (particularly the 3 year old) aren’t losing a very in-depth emotional connection. By that I mean a 3 or 5 year old doesn’t have the complexity of a 12 year old, and even though moving on is very hard, a younger child can do it a bit more easily. A 3 year old would lose “mommy”. A 12 year old would lose “mommy”, but they also might lose a trusted confidant, best friend, emotional supporter, role model, cheer leader, teacher, etc. when a parent dies. It’s hard for both children and I don’t wanna diminish the loss for younger kids because it’s still a huge deal and devastating. Younger kids are just able to bounce back a little better because even though their mom and dad are still their parents and they’ll always love them, there’s time for other loving people to fill those roles (like how you can love your real dad and a stepdad) and they feel less like they’re missing something. Love isn’t limited like society makes it out to be at times. A loving family can protect a child from a lot, and a loving family doesn’t always have to be biological parents, so children like that can absolutely still become healthy, happy, well-functioning people"

TheHandmaidsTale,exho6dw,t1_exhbod2,1566310157.0,"Happy to hear you’re moving on :) As difficult as it is, I feel like people who have endured emotional trauma and then healed have a level of depth to them that people who haven’t often don’t have. By level of depth I mean like a certain kind of more advanced empathy, and people who need that can sense it and connect with you. Even if it’s just smiling at a stranger. I think by healing after trauma you have a certain little thing about your energy and just “being you”, you can be a light to others"
TheHandmaidsTale,exhnsl3,t1_exgrx9m,1566309889.0,"This tip seems stupid, but don’t worry about what other people think, and don’t expect to make friends. My classmates were MEAN. I was gossiped about a lot (people couldn’t get over that I worked part time at Hooters while I was in school) The same people complained that I “talked too much in class”.... but I literally only raised my hand so much because NO ONE else was. So, don’t be afraid to raise your hand as much as you want and contribute. You’re all paying the same to go to class, but by being part of things you get more knowledge than the rest. 

We had support groups we had to attend with the other therapists, and they sucked. Be careful if you have to go to those- you never wanna be “that person” who spills their heart out. I know people in other schools had positive experiences in these groups, but they weren’t like that for me. A client cut my hair (and I was super upset) and it happened right before the group. I ended up saying it to them because we had to share about our days, and my classmates were literally happy about it. So, move slowly if you have those groups. 

Grad school is expensive and difficult, and if there’s ever a time to be ruthless and take whatever you can, it’s now. You’re all paying the same, so try hard learn more and be more valuable than the rest. Everyones gonna be competing for the same jobs when you’re out... and honestly the “good” jobs are few and far between so you want to be one of the best to get one. Don’t be afraid to be made fun of, or say something incorrect. And don’t skip class unless you think you’re dying. 

Also, PRIORITIZE SELF CARE! I watched many of the other therapists fall apart. And I noticed that quite a few of them hated themselves. Personally, I’ve had my struggles (like everyone else) but I’m in the gym 7 days a week and honestly I feel like I sweat out any negative  energy absorbed by clients (not saying my clients are bad, it’s just hard to hear the bad parts of people’s lives without taking it to heart and being impacted). Make sure you find what does that for you- don’t keep other people’s issues bottled up in you."

I didn’t realize how much children were drawn to me (although other people said it, I didn’t believe it).

I definitely think some boys might struggle in the way you’re describing, but even with the superiority, boys aren’t safe either.

TheHandmaidsTale,exgfv01,t1_exge6la,1566262995.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate that :) I had inner-city elementary school aged children as my clients for a year and a half. I did individual therapy and planned my own therapy groups based on what was needed. Prior to that, I worked with 2nd grade girls (many with special needs) in an all out-door, electronic-free setting. The purpose was to help them unplug, connect with their peers and enjoy nature. 

....Now I’m feeling like I’m slowing dying because the state of NJ is taking so long to give me my formal license to practice 😭 (the other one was temporary, I need the new one now that takes months to process). I have a woman who is kind enough to let me join her private practice..... she’s got a huge wait-list of children who I’ll be working with. So at least when I get the license I can get up and running fast. 

I’m very upset because we keep seeing shootings and violence......yet the government takes their sweet ole’ time getting fully-educated and qualified therapists out there 😞 Sorry to get political, it’s just super frustrating.

TheHandmaidsTale,exgeeht,t1_exgbbn8,1566261934.0,"Thank you! The splitting with Rebecca was startling to watch. I feel like most of those kids would struggle with splitting after being freed. It’s kinda weird to me that splitting is most frequently associated with personality disorders, considering it happens to so many people who don’t have them.

(Splitting is seen in eating disorders frequently, clients believe they’re eating “perfect” or eating “wrong”. Over-achievers in school can split, believing anything that isn’t an A is a failure. Even alcoholics split in a way- they either drink an excess or not at all.)

I agree it’s an interesting topic, and If it’s personally relatable you can feel for those kids. Relating makes it all the more interesting to learn about (because the added personal insights that accompany the learning). I think I’m headed to an attachment-based trauma therapy training sometime soon... I’ll have to update this subreddit when I learn some new things!"

TheHandmaidsTale,exgdkr4,t3_csov49,1566261338.0,"That scene had me BALLING MY EYES OUT😭 I had a life changing experience working at a summer camp with girls, most of which had Down Syndrome or other disabilities. I applied for the job at the lowest point in my life, and I genuinely believe they saved me. 

The special needs girls I worked with were literally beacons of light- they forced me to see how good people could be. I had a group of 15 girls who were my “team” all summer and we quickly became an extremely close knit group. for I watched one little girl with sensory sensitivity (hated dirt/sticky things) truck through waist-high mud for our team during a relay race. My entire group of [tired] girls walked back down a big hill in 100 degree weather at the end of the day because one girl (who couldn’t tie her shoes) was left behind at the bottom and needed help. One day, I was crying to female coworker about a break up.... some of them overhead me, brought a male employee over and presented me my “new boyfriend” 😂😂😂 

That was my first time working very closely with girls with special needs, and I don’t have the words to describe how incredible they were.   With no makeup, a messy ponytail, a lot of extra weight, while wearing old tees, basketball shorts and crocs... they still greeted me like I was The Queen of England every day! That scene made me picture them as grown ups and felt like a punch in the gut. I was devastated to part with them when they went back to school.... I can’t even wrap my head around how excruciatingly painful it would be to lose a sibling or child like that. 

Sorry for the novel, just letting you know you aren’t the only one who was freaking out during that scene 😅"
90dayfianceuncensored,exgavdv,t1_exgaa0w,1566259384.0,"Right???! I feel like I should be annoyed and yet I am not. 

I bet you’re right and there is a lot to unpack there. But metaphorically, as her therapist you’d be unpacking a LV suitcase 😂 Because she’s a well functioning person- it’s just her emotions and expectations that she needs help with."
TheHandmaidsTale,exgans0,t1_exg7wgy,1566259247.0,"I’ve thought about that too. Soon I’ll be working at a new place, and I was told I’d be working with some children who are going through the adoption process. (Previously, I delt with children being removed from the home... so this is an exciting and happy change for me)

But, it made me think about this show because....Who’s helping these kids adjust? 

Even if Gilead has instilled extreme fear in these kids, that’s not enough to make them just “adjust” and look like everything’s okay.

So, while kids might not openly rebel, there would surely be issues manifesting in other ways. I’m sure there’d be children who would totally stop speaking after this trauma. Some children could develop vocal conditions as a result of the PTSD.... so what are they doing with those situations? Force can’t always make these kids talk. There’d likely be a lot of self-injurious behavior- kids scratching themselves, biting themselves, head banging, etc. Many “new parents” of Gilead would have sleepless nights because there’d probably be tons of night terrors. Some kids might even disassociate all together and have little grasp on reality. 

A lot of these children would have serious issues.....so this seems like a realllllllly bad time to kill all the therapists. The therapists could have been valuable weapons for Gilead and for a while I assumed the therapists were forced to further brainwash the children! (until I rewatched the first episodes and realized they were dead.)"

TheHandmaidsTale,exg9cv8,t1_exg1rll,1566258401.0,"I’m sorry to hear you had that difficult time. That’s a lot to handle for anyone, but it’s extremely overwhelming for an 11 year old. At 11, kids just don’t have the wide range of coping skills that a healthy adult would have. So that’s why as a society, I pray that people will stop diminishing things that children struggle with. 

You can easily carry 25 pounds of items, I’m assuming. But, would you judge a child for not being able to carry 25 pounds of items? Probably not because they aren’t developed enough physically to have that strength- Emotionally is no different. Kids can’t “carry” those heavy emotional things like adults, so I really hope that 11 year old you had people who validated you and didn’t make you feel “less than” for struggling.

I’m glad you were able to make some personal connections and gain some insight! I feel like the show has definitely done that for me as well, which is one of the main reasons I like it. Best of luck to you :)"
TheHandmaidsTale,exg8jag,t1_exg34eq,1566257867.0,"If you want to check out the [non-adult stress scale ](https://www.pedagogy-inc.com/PedagogyInc/media/PedagogyMedia/PDF/Non-Adult-Stress-Scale.pdf) by Holmes and Rahe I’ve linked it right here. They have two scales- adult and non-adult. Personally, i think there should be another one for smaller children, but this is a general idea of what would cause them stress to varying degrees. Divorce is a big one. Changing schools is listed as well- and that was another one the Gilead children faced. 

Abuse is absolutely a stressor, but it’s not on the scale because the scale measures events (where as abuse is typically more of an on-going thing). I think they measure events because they’re looking at what “normal” changes would stress a child to the point of increasing their chance of becoming ill. So, abuse doesn’t need to be listed because abuse is never “normal”, abuse alone increases the child’s chance of becoming ill...so doesn’t need to be combined with anything else.

The majority of children who suffer from abuse would not turn out like Serena and Fred. Some probably would, but most would not. Children learn how to have empathy, but in some abusive homes there’s no opportunity for that. If a child is in a situation that’s so awful- such as them being abused by both parents, it’s advantageous to focus on keeping themself safe. Feeling bad for the abuser feels is unlikely. I imagine these Gilead children often learned empathy from handmaids and marthas. Marthas who stopped by their rooms to see if they were okay, who comforted them during flashbacks, etc. modeled empathy for these children so most of them had the chance to learn it. 

I don’t think any of the children are “doomed”. Even when the damage caused by abuse is severe and irreversible, there is still hope for that child to improve. They might not have as good of a memory or as much cognitive abilities as they would have if raised in a loving home, but they can learn how to love, how to have healthy relationships, and how valuable they are. Once they feel safe, they can put their energy into things like self-development. There’s critical times (which are the best times to learn certain skills) but when abuse is so severe a child doesn’t focus on those skills. They’re surviving only. A kid who has to put the bulk of energy into surviving doesn’t have enough left to thrive. Many children with severe abuse don’t have hope that other children have. Without hope, there is no desire to thrive because there would be no reason to. 

There would probably be a lot of children who may turn these negative feelings and the abuse inward through self-harming/sabotaging behaviors. Serena and Fred turn their negative feelings outwards for the most part, as we’ve seen them hurt others numerous times. No matter how they turn out, most would not be like Serna and Fred. So, overall these children have probably all been exposed to empathy and sympathy in various forms and I would guess that most would probably choose this path for themselves."
90dayfianceuncensored,exg0t5n,t3_csjpnb,1566252847.0,"As a therapist and certified life coach.... I really wish I had Darcy as a client. 

She’s a beautiful woman who’s built a very successful life for herself (her clothing line is a big deal!). She’s raised daughters that are lovely and kind, she has a supportive and untreatable friendship/relationship with her twin sister, and they all share such a nice home. 

Yet....she’s unhappy and it really seems like the big thing standing in between her and happiness is some self-worth/self-esteem issues. She repeatedly puts her happiness into the hands of others and watches helplessly as it crumbles, again and again. It’s almost like she doesn’t understand that the love she puts into people will not always come back around to her. 

She really is a smart woman. Yes, she likes to be silly and act ditzy/playful (which is okay) but that definitely doesn’t take away from her intelligence. She could absolutely learn to help herself and take charge of her own happiness. I hope Darcy does get in touch with a good therapist (or life coach. she appears mentally well [no clinically significant mental illenss], so she doesn’t necessarily need a therapist and a life coach could help her make big strides)."

A kid from the inner city joins a gang because the world around him is a mess and he doesn’t feel safe (like the people in Gilead). This kids friends pick up up, and once he’s in the car they say “Oh, well because you stole a some snacks from 711 with us, we’re gonna go steal from the Hermès store now.... What do you mean you’re not in? You steal. And you chose to be a part of this gang.”

TheHandmaidsTale,esnj0zp,t1_esnib8j,1562134341.0,Ooops I totally misread your comment! I thought it said “I’ll never understand what the directors were trying to do” 😂
TheHandmaidsTale,esnis07,t1_esnh152,1562134037.0,....Honestly I was thinking that fake pinky was going to catch on something and fall off during the dance
TheHandmaidsTale,esnip4m,t1_esnib8j,1562133944.0,"I interpreted that scene as a visual depiction of how they NEED each other in order to be successful in this world that they helped create. 

When Fred was alone, no one was particularly interested in him. Serena chatting with the women wasn’t anything special either. 

But, when they came together and danced that’s when they got the attention and approval of others.  I though this scene was basically showing us how much more powerful the connection (even if only political) between Fred and Serena is than either of them could be individually."
ChoosingBeggars,esmd5aj,t1_eslz0d6,1562102968.0,"Oh that’s absolutely what I did! It’s kind of a long story, but I called a shit group out in front of the entire class and completely embarrassed them all. It was a sight to behold. 

To set the scene: Most of my grad program was older, established adults. And I had put a jacket over my uniform, but I rushed to class from work, and it was still quite obvious that it was a Hooters uniform....Being publicly roasted by a 24 year old Hooters girl with BBQ-crusted hair is not the kind of thing most people forget."
ChoosingBeggars,esmbf1t,t1_esm8hd3,1562101949.0,"Same! Well to be fair, I had a frog in grad school, he needed to be fed 3xs a week, it took me 30 seconds to do and he ate from the same food jar for 8 years (it lasted his entire life)

But this lady I had to do a project was literally like “I can’t handle this I have 4 dogs”.....😭😭😭"
ChoosingBeggars,esloduj,t1_eslbuzr,1562089115.0,"I noticed that group projects didn’t get better in college as well. 

But, I held on the belief that they’d get better in graduate school....

They actually got WORSE. People expecting me to do more of the work because....

(1) I was younger, so I had a “better memory”
(2) I was younger, so the technology was “easier for me to use”
(3) I’ll have “more time to be in the workforce” so I need the knowledge that comes from doing the project “more”
(4) I didn’t have kids to take care of, so with more time on my hands I should do more for the project 
(5) I’m not responsible for any pets (yes, someone had the nerve to tell me that)
(6) I don’t have a house to manage, so I’ve got more time to do others work 
(7) I get good grades, so I should do more because it comes easier to me 
(8) I only worked part time (two part time jobs, btw) in addition to school, so I should do more of the project than people who had full-time positions 
(9) I have more energy (this idea came because I’m an athlete and would show up to class in my gear at times), so I should do more of the research to “put my energy to use” (wtf)
(10) I’m “creative” (this idea came because I brought 1 painting to a lecture, 1 time!) so I should do more because my “ideas will be better”

Those are only my top 10. People get out of control when it comes to group work, and truly I believe this NEVER gets better"
bodybuilding,esgp6k1,t1_esghkzw,1561960649.0,"I agree with you. It’s verrry hard to find a flattering figure suit! 

I feel like you can ....
(1) choose to make your legs look longer with a high cut, but then your core looks shorter, 
(2) choose to elongate your core, but create the illusion of shorter legs or 
(3) pick something in the middle.

Something in the middle would have probably been a better choice because she’s very well proportioned. (Perhaps the suit was bought too early in prep?) Her torso is so long and lean, and her legs are also super long and lean. Neither upper or lower body over power each other. Often, choosing a suit is so strategic to create an illusion, but it seems like she didn’t need to create an illusion because her shape and conditioning are so spot on. 

It’s so frustrating trying to find a suit that fits right (especially as you change through prep.) And it’s extremely disappointing to place lower than someone because your suit no longer fits as well and flatters the body you worked so hard on. Thankfully, the quality of her physique shined brighter than the suit selection and she won!!"
mentalillness,es5gqqx,t3_c5r3pv,1561611376.0,"5. The Attributers: “It’s because you don’t get enough sleep.” “This is because you aren’t willing to be patient.”These people think they know exactly why you are struggling in the way that you are. This can be hurtful because when someone is struggling, there are often a lot of factors that come into play. (For example, a person could struggle with depression because of a bad break up, poor sleep schedule, inadequate diet, less than ideal living situation and external pressure from family.) When people think they know what causes the person to struggle, they often believe pointing this is helpful to the struggling person. However, it comes off as reductionist and makes the person feel misunderstood. The Attributer sees a single rock on top of the struggling person, but the struggling person sees the entire avalanche."
