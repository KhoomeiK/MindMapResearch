hoarding,fqqioet,t1_fqp5exj,1589566194.0,"I've had issues with being messy since I was a little kid but when I got my own 2br apartment I let it get out of control.  I hit a breaking point and have been (off and on, over several months) working bit by bit to toss/sort/organize everything.  Things like finally having friends and coworkers over to visit are ofc awesome, but there were small things I've really appreciated, like having space to play fetch inside and being able to leave my blinds open without feeling anxious/ashamed when people walk past.

I'm already incredibly critical of myself for not having the energy to be able to keep my place clean, and the worse it got the more unbearable and overwhelming it was.  Growing up, my family would comment on how messy my room was, but instead of working on some sort of cleaning routine or teaching organization they'd just criticize me.  If they were trying to motivate me to clean, they went about it the wrong way by saying it was messy/dirty or it looked like a hurricane had swept through or that sorta thing.  The way in which they said it put me on the defensive, I took it more as an insult to me as a person rather than a comment suggesting that I need to clean.

Shortly before Covid-19 stuck my area I'd gotten my place clean and organized enough to where I felt comfortable having people over.  One of my friends is pretty awesome - shell help me out with things here and there with things that I struggle with.  Like last night she saw my garbage can was full and took it out when we went down to smoke.  My depression's been kicking my ass lately which'll make me fall behind on everyday chores.  She'll ask before moving stuff and ask where I want things.  Instead of any criticism she's got a positive attitude, if I apologize for something being messy (I over apologize) she'll let me know it's all good and not to worry.  I said I felt bad making her help me clean, at one point, and her response was that she wouldn't offer if she didnt wanna help.  Sometimes it's the little things that can really help out and mean a lot.


You can't make someone change though, you can only support and love them, imo, and help them if they're ready to."

I used to work with someone who told a handful of the same stories multiple times.  It was just the two of us working the night shift, 5 days a week together, so we had quite some time to chat on breaks over the years.  I had a couple of times where I was a tad annoyed at hearing a story that I'd heard several times before, but once I realized how happy it made him to not just tell a story but rather relive memories of better times I'd enjoy  each and every one he told me.

reactivedogs,fp8gua9,t1_fp5vilj,1588391948.0,"I've been on both ends of it and I was terrified every time.  I was honestly the most scared when it was my dog that got away.

  I just adopted a 6lb deerhead chihuahua last August.  He was kept inside the majority of the time, and wasn't one bit leash trained or potty trained.  He'd just freeze up and shake and refuse to move.  My other dog is a 10 y/o black lab mix who's reactive (she'll lunge and bark and ""start shit"" but she's never bitten or actually participated in a fight) and I'm worried that Lil Guy's picking up her behaviour.  Now he acts full of confidence, although he still gets a bit nervous/fearful here and there.  He now loves sprinting and bouncing around and loves fetch and knows a few basic tricks.

A couple of months ago I'd had a couple of beers before bed after work, around 8 am (a few hours past my bedtime) and had both dogs out for a walk when my lab started pulling towards another dog she saw.  I was focusing on her and Lil Guy started running full speed towards the other dog.

His leash went flying out of my hand and he ran to the other dog, jumping and biting at its side.  I, of course, had sprinted/dove for him and his leash and didnt catch up fast enough.  Ofc I apologized like crazy (after grabbing him and getting a few feet away) before I started bawling my eyes out.  My hands/forearms/knee were all torn up and I was shaking like crazy, but I was more than lucky that the other dog didnt react.  Iirc he's a very calm/laid back husky/golden retriever mix, with a super thick fluffy coat.  He wasn't hurt in any way whatsoever and the person walking him was nice about it but it could've ended up way worse.

I walked them separately for a bit, after that, as it made it a lot easier to work on problem behaviour, up till a few weeks back.  Thanks to Covid we're up to walking a few miles every other night or so, they're so worn out by the time I get home that they're way easier to walk."
raisedbyborderlines,foufup0,t1_fooia6v,1588083278.0,"In all honesty I'm not sure, but BPD is my first guess when it comes to my mother.  I wish my parents were more open with discussing mental health, as I still struggle with opening up about my own issues (with people irl).

I asked her once if she had bipolar and she said no.   We'd been on the subject of seeing a psychiatrist and refilling a prescription, and I was kinda surprised since I was simply curious what she'd been diagnosed with, but  instead of getting an answer she almost seemed kinda upset/frustrated.  I wasn't trying to be mean or anything and was genuinely trying to understand her a bit better.

I told my friend a story last week involving my mom going through my mail (after I'd asked her multiple times not to) and reading my medical records.  Looking back on all this now, it's a bit frustrating how she wouldn't talk about her own issues but would go through my shit.

Sorry for the really long answer to a short question.  Tl;dr: I think one of my parents may be bpd although I doubt I'll ever know for certain why either parent acts the way they do."
MurderedByWords,fotk5pw,t1_fosw4gt,1588056442.0,"Back when I worked in fast food, I had a coworker that was raised in a Christian family.

She made a comment along the lines of only religious people having moral values, more out of ignorance/naivety than maliciousness.  

I'm not religious at all, but I do hold to my moral values, and I shared that with her.  I like when others are kind and friendly to me, and I like when others treat me well.  I grew up hearing ""treat others how you want to be treated"" and try my best to be kind to everybody I meet.  

Most people are kind in return and I figure some people are either just grumpy people or having bad days, just as I do here and there.

Personally, I find the idea of needing a book to tell you right from wrong, and the threat of eternal punishment if you dont follow those rules a bit ridiculous."

  There are currently people starting to domesticate foxes, breeding the ones that are considered more friendly towards people, although there are a lot of genes that affect friendliness.  These semi-domesticated foxes now have some unique coat patterns that isn't seen in wild foxes. 

 It's true that we don't know exactly which genes cause a dog or fox to be friendly or not, but in a way we've selected for friendly loving traits in dogs over thousands of years."

TalesFromYourServer,fnlvgsv,t1_fiyh3o5,1587060434.0,"I don't often notice replies to comments so sorry this is a bit of a late response.  I understand that text doesn't always convey attitude or tone of voice all that well, but I tend to be excruciating polite and patient when I'm out in public.  I'm sorry that people have given you so much shit for your service dog - legally they're (I'm sure you know) only allowed to ask if it's a service dog and which tasks they're trained to perform.  I've seen videos where people with service dogs are harassed, some go on for 15-30 minutes, which is insane.  Asking for paperwork and stating nonexistant rules/laws and all sorts of fucking frustrating shit.  I try to spread the two service dog questions to those who don't know, I've met a few who weren't familiar with it whatsoever and had an assistant manager who thought you needed paperwork or something.  I've got loads of random (mostly useless but interesting) facts that I love sharing, but that's one I feel rather strongly about.

 In general the places I take Coco allow dogs inside - petco and pet stores are the only ones I'll let him walk around in, letting him sniff and explore.  I hold my arm in front of my abdomen area and he'll literally just lie on my arm, or sometimes sit and lean against my chest.  No one's mentioned him or asked about him for the most part, he goes with me to the bank, the dispensary, the gas station, the mechanic, all sorts of places.  I've only had one store ask me not to bring him back and that's because the owner's wife and child were allergic.  I had asked if it was okay to have him with me and then offered to put him in the car (it was a cool but relatively nice winter day) but was told it was alright as he was working alone that day (although they were often there), he just asked me not to bring him in the future if they were there (but I simply havent brought him, just in case).

The restaurant in my earlier comment is one of the few food places I take him into.  It's a small restaurant within walking distance of my place.  Sometimes i bring both dogs, in which case I'll order and then go wait outside with them.  Most of the time I only go over there when I've been drinking (it's one of the few food places I can walk to), as it's relatively expensive but really really tasty.  I asked the first time I had just Coco with me if they wanted me to wait outside and the lady shook her head and said I could sit at the counter while I waited (I always do togo when I'm by myself).  He would stay in my lap and hang out, while I generally would end up chatting with old guys drinking their morning coffee.  Seriously, you seemed to take a lot of offense to my earlier comment.  My dog goes mostly everywhere with me, although I'm respectful of where he is and isn't allowed, and he's perfectly fine being left in the car while I run in to one store or another.

If anyone were to ask me to take him outside or if they were to ask if he was a service animal, I'd apologize and take him out just as I'd be honest about him being a pet.  I wouldn't make a fuss or be upset or be rude in any way whatsoever.

This dude's 6 pounds, I can't reach him without sitting/crouching down sadly, and I pet/rub/scritch his back/head/ears when I'm anxious.  It's kind of like a self soothing sort of behaviour and it looks way more normal to the public to do that sorta thing to a dog than to myself.

So, sorry I'd been aiming for a quick response, my bad.  There's a large range of conditions (not sure if that's the right word to use) that qualify people for the use of a service dog and I'm hoping that one day I'll get to the point where I can have a professionally trained service doggie to help me out in life.  My two dogs help me plenty in every day life, although there're a handful of tasks I'd love to be able to train them to do but can't (due to me not knowing how, moreso than them not being able to).

I haven't seen a doctor/dentist/psychiatrist in years.  I'd been working to the point where I was too exhausted to do normal adult things, I just slept and worked.  I'd been trying to save up money so I could get some things taken care of and then Covid-19 popped up.  I finally worked up the energy to go on an actual grocery trip a week or so ago, for the first time in months.  I'd just been grabbing a stack of frozen dinners every once in awhile and mainly eating fast food and food from work.   As much as I'd someday love one, service dogs are time consuming and expensive to get.  I don't think it's shitty of me and I dont think it's abusing any sort of system.  If I'm asked to leave or put him in the car I would do so in a polite manner.  If I were to lie or start trouble then ye, that'd be different."
prolife,fnkvg6d,t1_fnjab2v,1587040990.0,"From my experience, the people I've personally known that had an abortion would not have been able to properly care for a child, which would have likely been born addicted to drugs and/or with mental disabilities.

These people were fun to hang out with, when I was in my early 20's, but they smoked cigarettes and weed, drank alcohol, and some did all sorts of other substances as well.  They lived in poverty and most of their money went towards partying, there's no way they'd've had money to spare for baby supplies as some couldn't even afford regular meals.

One girl in particular comes to mind.  She was a few years younger than me when I knew her, so maybe somewhere around 16-18.  At one point she had an abortion and was prescribed affordable (if not free) birth control as well as a bunch of information.  They moved in with us sometime around then, as both she and her boyfriend were homeless.

I have no children myself, although I'd like to foster/adopt once I'm ready, both emotionally and financially.  I love watching videos/reading articles about raising children, whether it's academics or dealing with problem behaviour or raising those with neurological disorders.  I think high schools ought to have a class for helping teens learn about adult stuff - like oil changes and rotating tires and filing taxes and how to raise kids or work though conflict in both romantic and business environments.  Not everyone has strong role models in their lives to teach them.

I've heard some awful stories of neglect and abuse, because, sadly, some people just aren't fit to be parents.  Just the other day I listened to a youtube collection of some ask reddit responses, asking drug dealers about the times they'd called CPS on a client.  One that stuck out to me was the dealer that came to sell to this couple (who were in the garage or something, out of the rain), and saw their baby strapped into a car seat maybe a handful of feet away, crying, sitting in the rain.  The couple were both passed out iirc and were too far gone to be aware of the crying, let alone that the baby was cold and damp.

If that couple had gone in (when she first realized she was pregnant) and aborted the baby, would it be better to end his life prematurely than to let him live his first year of life neglected by his drug addicted parents?  Would it be better to have aborted him knowing that he'll likely grow up in foster care and may not ever know his real parents?  I want to put my heart and soul into the future kids I wanna foster and I'm sure there are plenty of foster families that love and care about their kids, but I've also heard some awful stories from people that grew up in foster care, sadly.

Obviously, birth control is the better option. Hopefully we, as a society, will get to a point where nearly everyone is on birth control unless they're actively trying for a child.  I dont know too much about them, but those arm implants that are long term birth control are pretty neat.  Hopefully we'll get to a point where unexpected pregnancies are rare, where people settle down and are stable in life before they choose to try to get pregnant.  Where high schoolers all get a rod or something put in their arm, and they don't have to worry about babies for the next decade.  When I was in high school, protection was glossed over and they spent much more time talking about abstinence.  I didn't even know where you'd go to get birth control and as far as anatomy was concerned I didn't even understand my own parts, let alone anyone else's.  I didn't know anything about menopause, until my mom and one of my coworkers went through it at around the same time.  That one was fun to experience.



Sorry I kinda rambled for a bit there - I had a beer and I ended up putting a lot of time/thought into the topic.  I guess what I'm getting at is it's not like people get abortions so they can keep fucking around.  Sure, ideally if someone abuses drugs/alcohol and they get pregnant they quit, settle down in life, and raise their family.  I wish the world was sunshine and rainbows, but it's the children in those sorts of situations that'll likely suffer, sadly.

Like lots of things in life, it's not a black and white issue.  It's a combination of problems that lead up to this issue and hopefully one day we'll get to a point where abortion isn't an issue, simply because accidental/unwanted pregnancies don't occur.  If only it were easy to get large groups of people to listen and follow advice, covid-19 is proof of how hard it can be - while a good portion of people are sticking to something of a quarantine, getting EVERYONE to follow the rules is pretty tough/frustrating."

I've had a lab mix for about ten years that helps me out, although I'd walk her to the store (gas station convenience store or restaurants) and then leave her tied up outside (worrying about all the various awful things that could happen while she was alone outside).

Last August though I took in my ex-neighbour's lil 1 y/o chihuahua.  He's done well with being held since I got him, though teaching him not to eat non-toys, potty training, and leash walking have been a battle as he knew nothing about those when I got him.  I take him with me to the nearby restaurants and he sits or lays in my arm quietly the entire time I'm there.  Despite being afraid people were going to ask if he was a service dog and worrying that they'd tell me to leave, no one's asked yet.

Long answer to a short question, my bad.  I work in a restaurant and have no issues with well behaved dogs, though luckily I haven't really had any badly behaved dogs brought in on my shift.  Someone supposedly brought in a llama on my day off, I was a bit crushed that I missed it haha.

The people that bring in untrained pets frustrate the hell outta me.  I worked in a grocery store a few years back and saw some people shopping in the produce area with an extremely hyper pit.

Conservative,ezs0r42,t1_ezps3ke,1568081294.0,"Not every kid prefers toys/activities that appeal to their gender, I was never into dolls growing up and preferred books and outdoor activities (playing in the forest/field behind my house, playing games with my neighbors and brother like hockey, soccer, and tag) as well as video games once I was a bit older.  To this day I still have little interest in babies and one of my favourite things to do is take my dogs down to the river or park.

My parents were rather laid back when it came to gender stereotypes, they mainly cared about us being safe and kind to one another.  I had an aunt that would get me a doll every Christmas, although like I said I didn't care for them, but I was told to show appreciation for the gift I was given, as it's the thought that counts.

I was quite frustrated as I got older, as my little brother got to go camping in scouts and did all sorts of stuff that I thought was really neat.  I had a little bit of resentment towards Girl Scouts, as we stayed inside and made bracelets and stuff - which I found fun once or twice, but I wanted to go camping and exploring.

I feel that any kid should be able to enjoy any age appropriate toy or activity, regardless of which gender they are and which gender the game is geared toward.

Parents shouldn't be upset about the things their kids enjoy, within reason."

Apparently (I was told years later) we went on vacation and she must've fallen out of the car at one point.

The first time was when she got into it with my friend's dogs, they were bonded and dominant in personality, and at one point the two of them teamed up against my girl in a battle to claim leadership of the bed in our room.  They weren't full on fighting, but they were at the point just before where they were snarling/growling and making threatening jabs at each other.  I grabbed my girl by the back end, right where her legs meet her hips, and tugged her back, quickly and forcefully, away from the two of them.  This scared the shit out of her, and she turned around, yelped, and nipped my finger.  I remember her eyes widened in fear and she rolled onto her back and peed herself all over the carpet.  It did work, however, as all three girls cut it out instantly.

Tl;dr, the only time I tried pulling my dog out of a possible fight by her back end, she was able to turn around and bite me although it did work.

Outside like in a park or on a hike I'd see no need to stop a person from using any sort of stim, so long as they stay safe.

The only stim's I can understand stopping someone from doing would be those that could hurt themselves or others, such as biting, hitting, or bonking their head into a hard surface.

I was watching a video a little while back and it had a bit involving something like aba therapy.

I tried telling her that autism's a spectrum, and though some people perhaps couldn't keep up with the fast pace, there are also plenty of people who can, albeit it perhaps requiring a bit more effort than a NT.  She didn't seem to listen to what I said, and her response implied that I just didn't understand what it's like.

It's frustrating as fuck since I'm (pretty certain that I've) got undiagnosed autism, along the lines of aspergers, and am too shy to openly tell people so.

My anxiety took over and every here and there, for months on end, I've wondered if she was implying that I should find a different job or that I didn't do well at what I do.

As far as parenting goes, it's frowned upon to give in to kids whining/crying to sleep with you.  I've seen some kids on nanny shows come up with reason after reason to not sleep.  The longer they have the habit of crying in their own room and then sleeping in their parents' room, the harder it is to break.





Not saying that OP's kid is whining in any way whatsoever, rather I think something's waking up the child.  It could possibly be paranormal, it could be some naturally explainable thing, or it could be something mental (like sleep paralysis/nightmares).

That's inhumane and cruel treatment.  As far as I know, husky's aren't used as guard dogs, but even guard dogs need regular exercise.  They also don't sit tied up, that does nothing to defend against an intruder.

No animal should be forced to live/sleep in the same area they pee/poop in, and dogs naturally dislike eating/sleeping near their bathroom areas.

I'm sorry for that poor doggie, it'd be hard not to sneak over in the middle of the night and free him.  =("

I knew a couple of people, when we were teens, who got a couple of dogs for free off of craigslist.  Although the dogs were very well loved, these guys didn't have the money for basic necessities, let alone any possible vet bills.  After some time, they returned the dogs to the original owners - they tied them to a tree outside the house and left them.  Years later, I'm still pissed, as I'd've loved to have given those two a home.  They were a husky/wolf mix and a husky/collie mix, and were both absolutely amazing ^^

Where I live (west coast US), it's common to see cats outside here and there, but I almost never see dogs outside without their owners.  The only times I have, they've been pets that have gotten out.  There are lots of dogs up for adoption (and even more cats) but they're not abundant enough to roam around freely."
