depression,eyf9o9j,t3_cwl19g,1567045491.0,"I used to feel this way. I knew I would never kill myself, but if something were to happen to me. I was ok with it. I knew my depression was bad when I went to see my psychiatrist. & she asked me “what about your daughter? Doesn’t thinking about her without you make you not want that?” & not even my daughter made me give a shit if I died. I’ve been on my medication for over a year now. & I’m glad to say things have gotten a whole lot better. I hope things get better for you too."
