Unrequited feelings are some of the worst feelings. Try not to let it get in the way of your confidence, though. Yeah, easier said than done. But from what I can see, you’re worth it. 

As for the friends — I truly believed most of my friends hated me. And some of them did. I didn’t have the self-esteem at that time to cut that toxic bullshit out. Or to recognize that I deserved better. So, I will tell you: you can cut that toxicity out of your life if need-be. Fake friends are a dime a dozen. But also be sure you’re not perhaps imagining some of this feeling. 

You’ve got this. You are amazing."

I was afraid of coming out to my old therapist. I mean, the whole concept of “coming out” sounds more complex than anything I’m comfortable with anyway. So I just went out with it. And he said, “oh, I knew that.” Like, okay? 

I asked him why he didn’t tell ME then and apparently it was for me to accept on my own.

Anyway, after that point, I was able to open up about a whole new group of insecurities I hadn’t realized I was storing and it’s been an amazing journey of self-discovery. Any therapist that makes you feel less comfortable for coming out isn’t worth shit."
