Every player has a mood that could change based on a variety of things, but maybe some of the guys don't like your locker room or they didn't want to be traded. Guys can feel like they should be ""middle of the line up"" hitters and if you have them in the back end of the line up, they'll perform worse.

&#x200B;

You should also look into the batting coach that you have. If he's someone who focuses on contact hitters, he won't get the most out of your power guys. Finally, consider your stadium. A lefty who is an extreme pull-hitter and hits flyballs will play out much differently in Baltimore than in Oakland."
OOTP,fpumdb2,t1_fpu9sui,1588916824.0,"You should look into your pitching coach. They have personalities and preferences that impact what's happening. Your PC can be focused on groundball pitchers, power pitchers, or finesse pitchers. It makes a difference if you have a power pitching coach trying to help get the most out of Tim Wakefield.

If you go to your personnel, you can see what players each coach will have a better relationship with. If you're in commissioner mode, you can see even more information. The stadium you're playing in has a ton to do with it as well, so you may want to consider how important great pitching is. When I play as the Orioles, I sometimes go for elite infield defense and mostly ground ball pitchers. After all, it's hard to hit a home run when the ball is on the ground."

Because we ALWAYS have someone on shift, we’ve never called at vote in the middle of any of our individual (8, 12, or 4) meetings. Historically, practice has been to tally the votes at each meeting and see where the majority falls when all 3 meetings are combined. 

What makes this more complicated is that our shifts rotate. So the people attending our 8:00 meeting in April May be the ones who attend 4:00 in October.

People view wanting to die as a mental health issue regardless of your circumstance. I’m a believer that there are some scenarios where it’s reasonable- if you’re diagnosed with an incurable cancer, if you are in constant pain in your final days of life, etc. 

To that point, a lot of research has found people who survive a suicide attempt are happy to still be alive. The issue with that being that the research makes a general assumption, but even if 99% fit that research, there is still a part of the population that still regrets being alive. 

I’d never suggest suicide to anyone, but I think most of those arguments are about the person saying ending life is wrong. I find that a lot of those arguments come down to a person’s faith or the fact that they don’t want you to “go”."
