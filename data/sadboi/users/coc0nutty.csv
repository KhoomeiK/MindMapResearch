It really could’ve been the best it could be despite these changes. It’s understandable to not enjoy the ending for what it is. I’m just glad that Star and Marco are together."

Janna really be the only one other than Jackie that somewhat seemed cool. Hence they switched to the world of Mewni, and tbh it really could’ve been the better show if was in mewni from the get go and pace it off of that. Also Marco’s friends were just straight forgettable."

Y’all really need to get on Uzi’s ass to step up his production so much so he got his older song charting for him. I love Uzi, but his music be extra extra repetitive now. Luv is Rage 2 brought the bangers “The Way Life Goes” , “20 min”, “Feelings Mutual”
You know this guy got talent, don’t take this rushed poo poo album for surface value."
