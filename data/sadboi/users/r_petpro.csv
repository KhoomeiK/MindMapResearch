DoctorsAdvice,fnydvk2,t3_g4likf,1587360232.0,"Not a doctor but im almost sure thats an infected ingrown toenail. Best thing to do is call ur doctor and let them know, they will tell u to come in so they can pull the nail out (a painless process done with a local anaesthetic) then they will most likely give you a topical cream to help the area through the healing process. In the mean time, i suggest soaking your foot in hot water with some Epsom salt (not sure if thats how its spelt but its a bathing salt found at just about any grocery/drug store)  in it every few days and applying peroxide to the area every day (poor it over dont use a q-tip/cotton pod it will not help) this is all what i was told to do with mine it might not be 100% correct but i did this and nothing went wrong :)"

I got my first tattoo when i was sixteen with my older sister (we got beautiful matching ones in memory of my aunt who passed away) the artist made my mum sign a consent form and he was very strict about everything.
