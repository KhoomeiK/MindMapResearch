I’m standing around 24 blocks from the grinder. My design doesn’t have a water flush system and instead relies on mobs falling off by themselves, so someone told me they might’ve gotten stuck or something.

As for the caves, I’m not sure. My farm’s built around 70 blocks off the ground I think, so I’m not sure if I’m in the radius for mobs to spawn in caves. Then again, there’s a chance."
