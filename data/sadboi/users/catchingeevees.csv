BPD,ff3kx9l,t3_erb9pz,1579543239.0,"For me getting the diagnosis changed my life for the better. At the time I'd just made my most serious suicide attempt and a week before that had run away from home. All because of an unstable relationship. 

It's been exactly two years this month since I was diagnosed and for the first 18 months it was horrible. I over thought every little thing I did, lost any confidence I had and pushed away a lot of people. I couldn't shake the fear that I'd manipulated or abused people I'd cared about without knowing before my diagnosis and was going to do it again. 

But when therapy really started working, I had the right medication and I was working on myself, things started changing for the better. I'm still self aware but I'm not being eaten up by it. I'm not terrified that I'm going to manipulate or abuse people because I know that's not me. My bpd symptoms are getting less extreme and easier to manage. My confidence is coming back and I'm making better friends than I had before because I'm allowing myself to be me around them, something my bpd would never allow before. 

Everyone has their own timeline in recovery though. I know some people that got their diagnosis and were managing it within 6 months and there's people in my group therapy that are 4 years into their diagnosis and are just getting a handle on things. Being aware but still stuck in those thought patterns is the worst stage but it does pass. Best of luck to you ðŸ’›"
BPD,fexfxmc,t3_eqrdtd,1579430339.0,"It's such a struggle. Sometimes I feel like I'm managing it really well and then something triggers it and I'm back to square one. I start overanalyzing why their not using as many or different emojis than they normally do, why their messages are shorter than usual, what the full stop means, why they're taking so long to reply.

My friend has been dating a girl for a few months now and when he's with her he doesn't respond to my messages and it's so hard not to fall down the rabbit hole of him preferring her over me and getting ready to leave me. I know it's stupid because when I was with my girlfriend I didn't message him but I just can't shake it."
BPDmemes,f33lfyl,t3_dfhhem,1570640672.0,I want to staple this on the faces of everyone I know
BPDmemes,f2lw8yn,t3_ddmjjy,1570298897.0,Personally I consider it a bit of both. Your thoughts and feelings are more intense if you have bpd so it is a constant thing. But for a lot of the time that might not be noticable to others unless something triggers you and your emotions become a lot more extreme. That's when things like splitting can happen. Hope this helps :)
BPDmemes,exuzqu3,t3_cu1igb,1566590415.0,My therapist just referred me to a 6 month specialised bpd course because she thinks I'm coping great with my symptoms and I'm ready for intense therapy. My life is literally in shambles lmao
BPD,ewcmnwl,t3_cnj048,1565287220.0,"I'm torn between the idea that I'm going to die early and just not going to die lol. I've smoked since I was 16, I kicked my drinking problem nearly three months ago but I fucked my liver up plenty while it was in full swing and I have no doubt I'll relapse eventually and my overdoses also probably haven't helped my liver either. And yet I've been in so many situations where I should have died and didn't that part of me is half of convinced I either can't or is doomed to live until I'm ridiculously old and watch everyone I care about die. Either way I guess it's a pretty glass half empty point of view"
BPD,evcrlxw,t3_cixwsg,1564421735.0,"Totally. I've come to terms with the fact that I can't kill myself, most because of the effect it would have on the people I love. But the idea of being stuck in this head for the rest of my life drives me crazy sometimes. Always having to have a mind that is going to spiral into an uncontrollable depression over the smallest thing, that thinks the most distressing thoughts, that jumps from one emotion to the next and the next so fast I get whiplash... It just feels unfair that this is what I have to spend forever with."
BPD,ev020y6,t3_chpc8a,1564130463.0,"I totally get this. Most the time when I'm feeling awkward or anxious I turn into this complete mess of clumsiness, weird body positioning and just general awkwardness. At my new job I constantly struggle to move around people without looking like a T-Rex doing ballet unless it's really busy and my mind is focused on that rather than whatever I'm anxious about. Then occasionally I can switch into this ultra confident self that's almost this tiny bit arrogant and I know how to move, how to place myself and is complete secure in what I'm doing. But it only takes one knock back and I'm back in that usual state of not knowing what the hell I'm meant to be doing. It sucks. I wish I knew how to just switch it on when I wanted and needed it."
BPDmemes,et6o8jb,t3_ca5j5r,1562516422.0,"I was suspected to have bipolar since I was 15 by my therapist and psychiatrist but they were reluctant to diagnose me because of my age. Dropped out of therapy when I was 18, finally started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist again when I was 21 when things were very out of control and got diagnosed with bpd. I'd only ever heard of it once or twice and hadn't ever considered the possibility I might have it... Probably the stigma of personality disorders at play there"
BPD,estn3i8,t3_c91b16,1562270000.0,"I've managed to steer pretty clear of debt so far by only allowing myself one debit card that won't let me pay for anything once I'm under Â£20 and never any credit cards (I got very strict on myself after my first manic shopping spree). But I've blown my savings so many times. I bought a motorbike when I couldn't even drive. Once I'd managed to get together just over Â£2,000 and blew it all in maybe two weeks. It feels like I'm fighting a losing battle, spending months working my way towards where I want to be and ruining it all with a few days of impulsive choices."

BPD,ess9vqe,t3_c8vqnd,1562247921.0,"Can definitely relate. Sometimes it's predictable like job interviews, even though up until I walk through the door I'm having a complete internal meltdown but once I'm in the door I'm fine. I've never not got a job I applied for, a couple of which I'm barely qualified for. Most the time it's completely random though.

BPD,esicpv4,t3_c7ruk4,1562011169.0,"Up until about a year ago I almost never cried. Like, maybe three or four times a year if that, I was compartmentalizing my emotions and blocking any trauma so intensely nothing was coming through. Now so much gets to me. The other day I was having a really low day and cried trying to open my curtains. But it's weird, I'll cry for a couple minutes over what initially made me cry, then go numb, then whatever made me cry will resurface and I'll start crying again. Then it's just a cycle of crying and going numb for however long and when I finally do stop I'm numb for hours after."

BPD,es0vakt,t3_c5abi7,1561483729.0,"I'm mostly scared of unintentionally manipulating people. I found out months after a very rough patch in my mental health that I'd been very manipulative to someone I love more than anything and... I can't really explain what that's done. I don't think I'll ever really forgive myself for doing that to her or be able to look at myself for being able to do that to anyone I love and care about. I analyze everything I say and do now, constantly going over past conversations, always wondering whether I'm being manipulative. I almost never feel like I can properly open up to people because I'm having to filter everything I say in case anything could be even slightly manipulative... It's exhausting but I'd take this every time over hurting her again or anyone I care about."
BPD,es0b1sy,t1_erzn8b7,1561470908.0,"I completely agree. This person doesn't seem to have the faintest idea what bpd actually is or how someone  with it functions. While I think there is a place for a positive outlook on bpd, to overlook everything that bpd is and make it into something it's not isn't helpful for anyone. It just makes people with bpd less likely to work towards recovery because they're unaware of the areas they need to work on and people without people with bpd think we're gifted in areas that we actually really struggle in. A very misguided article in my opinion."
BPD,ert69hi,t3_c3qfr8,1561233593.0,Thank you for this huge burst of motivation!!! I'm starting back at college in September after a three year break and seeing you achieving I think is exactly what a lot of us needed. Keep being amazing!!
BPD,ergrwg2,t3_c1qmm9,1560855135.0,"Definitely! With sound I'm not too bad but I never go anywhere without a pair of headphones and unless I'm actually talking to someone I'll have them in because I need to have control of what sounds I'm hearing. 

With touch it's much worse, some days I can take more than others but when I'm having a low mood I can barely take any of it. It's tough because my best friend is very physical affectionate and finds it hard that I don't constantly want that. And when my mood is low his first stop at trying to comfort me is hugs, holding hands, all the things that make me feel worse."
BPD,erbzxf2,t3_c144cx,1560698984.0,"I honestly thought I was the only one who did this kind of thing... It even comes down to who messages first, who asks to hang out, things like that... If I feel like I'm putting in all the effort I become convinced they don't want to be friends anymore and are only talking to me out of politeness or because they feel bad. It sucks and I know I've come off as not caring at times but I just can't help it, I just don't want to seem needy or annoying and push people away even more."
BPD,er9n5tp,t3_c0v94j,1560626272.0,"Yes! I feel like having a mental illness and my home life as a child made me grow up much earlier and gave me this maturity that made it so hard to relate to people my age. At my first job I got on far better with my coworkers that are 30-50 years older than the ones my age. But at the same time I have this immaturity that comes out at times because I never really had time to enjoy my childhood (not whining, I'm most over it now). 

Relating to people my age has gotten easier as I've grown up but I still feel more at ease with people older than me."
BPD,eq7mp12,t1_eq6p2e2,1559849533.0,This is completely off topic so I apologise in advance but I always thought allisitic was used to describe non-autistic people and neurotypical was used to describe people without mental health issues... I could be mistaken so please correct me if I am!
BPD,epx3z3e,t3_bw54wb,1559591474.0,"Yes!! I made a playlist of love songs for an ex maybe a year or two before I was diagnosed with BPD. I never ended up showing it to her (thankfully) but I listened to it a few months ago and you could probably compile the entire diagnosis criteria from the lyrics in that playlist. 

It's made me look a lot closer at songs and their lyrics since then. Does make me wonder about people that seem to have the perfect relationship and yet their favourite songs have some very unsettling lyrics about relationships... Maybe that's just me though"

BPD,epojcyy,t3_bv860w,1559345444.0,"God I relate to this so hard. I've nearly always managed to pass off my bpd except to a couple of people very close to me. I was in a meeting with the doctor who diagnosed me a few months ago, hadn't seen him for years and the first thing he said after going over my history since then was that he was glad to see I'd stayed ""high functioning"" 

I hate it. Staying above water is exhausting and yet you feel like you can't tell anyone that because then they'll know that you're swimming when they're on jet skis."
BPD,epohmee,t1_epoagf1,1559344569.0,"I totally relate to that feeling of not knowing whether to abandon your FP or let them slowly abandon you. When I can feel them pulling away and putting distance between us (or my bpd is telling me that, whichever it is) I get the urge to leave and convince myself it's like pulling off the band-aid. That way I can save myself the pain of every day feeling more and more distance between us. But then there's that other fantasy side that convinces myself everything will be okay eventually, this future I've created in my head for us will turn out in the end, I just need to be patient... It's such a struggle to know what the right choice is

It can feel very overwhelming when I have so many feelings but that tends to be when I've had something big trigger that low mood. Then I'll have all the usual emotions I have whenever my mood is low plus the feelings caused by whatever actually triggered the low mood. It's like the world's worst game of Jenga. That's my next step, it's a bit of a big one as it means letting go of my coping mechanisms that I've always felt comfortable in but aren't good for me and finding healthier ones but I know it'll benefit me in the long run"
BPD,epnynik,t1_epnvcwl,1559335578.0,"The intense overwhelming emotions are definitely a struggle for me. Personally, when I start getting overwhelming my head tends to just close into this thinking of 'I'm sad' or 'my FP hates me' when there's actually a lot more going on. I'll fall into this horrible black hole where I feel like all I can do is lie on my bed and stare at the wall listening to sad music for hours, or much more unhealthy coping mechanisms.

My therapist gave me this worksheet which is essentially just this A4 sheet covered in lists of feelings. So when I start feeling that black hole closing in I can go through and instead of thinking ""I'm sad because my FP has done this"" I can say ""I feel upset, betrayed, abandoned, etc."" Sometimes there'll be 5-8 emotions I'm feeling that I hadn't recognised and just being able to pinpoint exactly what I'm feeling has calmed me and lessened the intensity of whatever I've been feeling. 

Thank you, hopefully we'll both be able to figure our way out of our little messes"
BPD,epnu2ne,t3_bva81u,1559333353.0,"I don't know you, but I feel so proud of you. The honesty it takes to have with yourself and your bpd to write this is incredible. Both things you asked of your girlfriend are fair and realistic and I think if you enter into a relationship with her again there'd be nothing wrong at all with that, and it would really benefit your relationship. And like you said, you're not demanding it of her, it's just a suggestion that you think could help her and in turn you. 

One thing I would suggest that has helped me a lot when I've been in this situation and struggled with no contact is texting myself. It sounds silly but being able to text ""her"" really helped me during that time, even if it was just silly things I'd seen during the day or a good morning or good night text. Best of luck to you man, I really hope this situation turns out well for you."
BPD,epnruxq,t3_bvaru1,1559332249.0,"I'm in a bit of a mess with my FP at the moment so I don't know if my advice will be any help but there's a few things I do that I think have helped me not ruin our relationship entirely. 

I think most importantly for me when I'm feeling something very intense towards my FP or am going to act a certain way towards them I try to ask myself if I would be doing this if it was someone else. For example, if I texted her in the morning and I can see she has been active throughout the day but hasn't messaged me, it reaches the evening and my mood is really low because of that or I want to message her asking why she's ignoring me/if I've done something wrong/something angry... I try to think how I would if my friend had done this. I'd probably just brush it off as them being busy, not seeing the message, forgetting about it... all things I've done before. 

It doesn't really get rid of those feelings but it does help me rationalize them and help me not act out as much."
BPD,epnhguv,t3_bv9uo9,1559327517.0,"I'm in the same situation, it drives me insane. Nothing effects me the way my FP does and I hate it. I don't want to depend on anyone that much but I just feel completely helpless to the extremes of emotions my FP causes.

Yet it doesn't really matter what arguments I have with family members, friends, coworkers, anyone, I always can manage to bounce back reasonably quickly.  

It's like my emotions are a river and recovery is a dam to help me deal with these extremes. other people might have the power to take one or two sticks away but she can just knock the whole thing down with one word. It's hell, even when it makes me feel great because the high never lasts."
BPD,eph2hg0,t3_burz98,1559221542.0,"I've had three jobs and I can kinda relate to this. First job I was almost always frustrated and came home feeling stressed, emotionally exhausted and unhappy. After two years my contract wasn't renewed but after all these negative feelings I was genuinely upset at having to leave. My co-workers threw me a leaving party and I cried in the bathroom, but I think it was mostly because I'd grown really close to the people there and had never had the support like they had given me. 

Second job was very much like a rinse and repeat of my first. I grew very close to a couple of people there but my mental health went down the drain while working there. I also met my FP there and after she left this made me hate working there even more. My relationship with my co-workers was practically non-existent and I dreaded everyday, by time I quit I was convinced I'd never regret it but now I consider it one of the worst decisions I've made in my career.

Third job I hated it after a week. I only stayed there a couple months and during that time had three weeks off sick due to stress. I haven't regretted it yet but I'm still waiting to start a new job and wish I had held on a little longer because being between jobs is never good for my head. 

I don't know, I don't think I'll ever be happy at a job. Having to balance the face I put on for each person is so hard when I have to interact with so many people during the day. It's exhausting. I want to feel like I have a purpose and I'm helping people but I always end up sacrificing my own health and happiness to do this and end up making myself sick. By time I get myself stable again no one at work takes me seriously again and only sees me as that person with the mental illness, which makes me want to prove myself even more and it turns into this vicious cycle. 

Bleh, maybe one day I'll figure it out. Or marry rich and not have to face my issues haha"
BPD,eozqfbr,t3_bthmwe,1558964830.0,"My FP once told me that when we're having an important conversation and she feels like I might be holding back she'll hold back to see if having some time to think makes me offer anything extra up to the conversation. That's actually been quite helpful for me and I've used it myself for other people too. 

I think it's all about context though. Expecting a specific response really fucks with my head like... No matter what I say at that point I feel like it's not right and the conversation really goes downhill from there"
