psychologystudents,eyvyu1l,t3_cysyu2,1567516204.0,"Reading your post and some of your replies, I would personally suggest looking into whether you really want to be a researcher. It takes a lot of time to get through the dredge and build up status to move away from the entry level tasks. What you’ve been asked to do is really common in undergraduate research labs as a way for you to complete your hour commitment without you constantly running experiments. In my experience, my first lab I joined I ran experiments although I wasn’t super involved with where the data went or what it meant until we talked at our meetings. My second lab I’m more involved with the data entry, actually being in the experiment, coding some of our results. I would say I’ve moved up in terms of status but I’m actually doing more of the “mundane” work. Often times you don’t get to have or run your own experiment until you’re accepted as a grad student or if you begin writing your honors thesis with the school. I think that if you either a) bring up your concerns at your next lab meeting b) take up both/either of the grad students offers at more responsibilities whatever it may be it shows you want more or c) stay there for the semester but be actively on the lookout for a research professor that aligns with what you want. I don’t disagree that your expectations of research and a research lab is slightly unrealistic. Research labs should be a good fit for you but you should also be a good fit for the lab. If you made a commitment, honor it. Source: am undergrad in psych labs currently writing honors thesis"

Unrelated but since you’re still in high school I’ll throw this out there- if your school offers a statistics class, take it and keep all the notebooks bc stats in psych is pretty big for research and it’ll help you get a leg up when you have to take the college course.

They come 45min-1hr late sometimes, messing up our in/out times and since we can’t offer them a rewards program pitch it hurts those percentages too, which I need to keep at a certain standard to keep getting shifts. It’s absolutely ridiculous that I do almost all of the work for them, they show up late and still steal whatever tip I was supposed to get."

vandwellers,eukr8tc,t3_cfx5rj,1563892133.0,What are some trailer vs van conversion points that you guys have? I’ve definitely seen less trailers and more vans here (not a big surprise)  and wondering what some downsides to an airstream would be
warpedtour,eu5da4e,t3_ceutmn,1563475097.0,"Freeze 2 1 liter waterbottles overnight: keep them sealed, by the time you’re walking around and everything they’ll thaw but still be cold. Saved my boyfriend and i for the last 6 years"

CBD,eu1qjr0,t3_cebr3o,1563373072.0,"I feel like when I’m actively smoking I’m “chilled” but afterwards, I don’t really feel anything. I have a relatively high tolerance to thc even after taking a couple weeks break to lower it again, I wish I could feel more of an effect with cbd. But also I bought a 250mg cart from a store that just opened up so maybe this store just sucks and I wasted $30."

TalesFromTheCustomer,etmnej9,t1_etmmtyx,1562963937.0,"I hope whatever server gets you as a customer ignores every need you may have, and provides the barest of service for you."
TalesFromTheCustomer,etmmqda,t1_etmm1th,1562963483.0,"We get paid $7 an hour to provide you with a pleasant eating experience and cater to your ass; if you can’t cover tip in a country where those are factored into our wages, don’t fucking go out to eat. God bless any server that ever has to come across your cheap, miserable ass."
TalesFromTheCustomer,etmlz8f,t1_etmla2u,1562962982.0,"If you can’t tip, don’t go out. Stick to fast food and vending machines if you’re going to waste your server’s time like that."
hapas,etljl38,t1_etkxhls,1562938208.0,"Thank you and good point, in the end it only matters that we’re happy with ourselves and our choices"
hapas,etljgvn,t1_etla06z,1562938118.0,"I hate speaking Spanish in front of anyone because I know they’ll speak it more naturally. I can understand what people are saying but it’s hard for me to be confident enough to string together a few sentences out loud. Then they get disappointed I “don’t know” Spanish even though I’m Hispanic. It’s a cruel circle haha. I had posted a photo of myself earlier but took it down and I completely understand, I am a pretty good mix between my mother and father and sometimes I can pick and almost see which nationality a feature came from (if that makes sense)."
hapas,etlja10,t1_etkgfyy,1562937972.0,"Thank you, when I was younger I envied all my white friends who knew exactly what they were and were confident in the places their ancestors came from but as we grow older I’m happy I’m almost literally a melting pot and there are parts of my cultural identity that are yet to be found"
hapas,etlj6k9,t1_etkt19r,1562937899.0,Yeah when I first found the page I didn’t know it would be called that and then everyone commented and was so nice I was surprised people thought it was an incel page. I think I’ve internalized preferring a specific nationality of mine for a long time and it’s going to take a while before I break out of those ways of thinking but I’m glad I found a community that can help. It’s gotten better as I’ve grown up and moved out of that suburban area though and people constantly ask me what my nationality is because they can’t put their finger on it.
hapas,etliz95,t1_etk5ce0,1562937742.0,Well hi!
hapas,etliyv1,t1_etk2gaq,1562937734.0,Ayeee that’s us!
hapas,etliy3c,t1_etk0whe,1562937717.0,This is me making it simple haha. There’s little bits of other nationalities on my fathers side I believe but I am *mostly* these big 4. I really want to do one of those 23 and me tests lol
hapas,etliuz0,t1_etk09tg,1562937651.0,"No I love the advice, I actually just started getting closer with my dad and his family (the black and Puerto Rican side) and slowly learning more about myself. Thanks for the kind words friend :)"
hapas,etliryg,t1_etjz97d,1562937584.0,"I hope it does, my only concern now is how many people love the idea of a “mixed baby” and how good they can look when they grow up. It’s a weird thing to focus on but I feel like i hear so much about it and being “lightskin”"
hapas,etlip4g,t1_etki7uo,1562937524.0,"Honestly, I grew up in a pretty mostly white suburban area. It wasn’t an exclusive “I’ll only date white people” it was just a majority of people around"
hapas,etjrbsw,t1_etjpubs,1562879723.0,Glad to finally find a name other than mixed! Was surprised to find out I was banned from a couple subs shortly after posting though
hapas,etjr95w,t1_etjqcxg,1562879676.0,"Thanks for the heads up, I was pretty worried about that too that’s why I didn’t post an image straight up"
