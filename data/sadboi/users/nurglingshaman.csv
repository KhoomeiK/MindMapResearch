BDSMcommunity,f7kdxou,t3_dvnqnf,1573805187.0,"Nothing too dramatic but when I was picking up my baby boy from the animal shelter a volunteer commented on my 'necklace'. I wear a steel ring collar and I've gotten innocuous comments in the past so I didn't even think about it. Later on Slam is getting checked out by the vet before we go and I get a good look at the volunteer, she's wearing a padlocked chain mail collar!! Like, first off how the hell did I not notice, second I almost died because no one has ever 'called me out' so to speak."
