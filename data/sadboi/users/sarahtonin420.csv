scoliosis,fijigdo,t1_fiji187,1582449466.0,"It's not that bad for everyone. It was traumatic for me because it was uncomfortable, humiliating and a constant physical reminder of my deformity. I was always painfully aware. It made me feel less than human 20 hours a day for a year. I felt disgusting and wouldn't let another person touch me, not even family. I already have anxiety so it was so much worse. Up until the brace, my scoliosis was just an X ray and some back pain. The brace made it painfully real and clear and I couldn't cope."

According to my psychiatrist, I was traumatized from wearing it, as I already had depression and anxiety. Wearing a back brace was the worst and longest year of my life. No one could have prepared me for the self loathing I would experience. I was isolated, and had no human contact. I was suicidal, and developed a self harm addiction. One year after taking it off, I am still recovering mentally and only just beginning to feel human for the first time in years. 

If you feel yourself spiralling, get help. I wish I'd had a therapist through that time, because the back brace seriously exacerbated my mental health. Sincerely, good luck."

What confused me was that she maintained a relationship with her parents for a long time. Very similarly to you, we only visited my grandparents a few times a year, and I was never alone with my grandfather. The visits stopped a few years ago, but now I wish they'd never happened in the first place. I can't imagine having an obligation to someone who betrayed and hurt me in the worst way."
