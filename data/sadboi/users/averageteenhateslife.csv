The worst thing that can happen is she says no, and even if she does don’t take it hard, I’ve been told no before and you just have to not take it personally, just do it bro! You won’t regret it! I’m assuming you’re in high school, I wish I still was, dances are so much fun and I regret all the time I didn’t go because I was scared. As long as you’re nice, fun and push past social anxieties if you feel any of them. Go to the dance as a friend date and if you feel more then that then act on it slowly, she’ll let you know or show you if she’s also interested! Do it bro! I believe in you!"

I know how bad things get, I went years without having a stress free day, everyday I cried myself to sleep. I know it sucks, but suicide is such a horrible idea, I know it seems nice so often but please don’t, I lost a friend during my junior year and it was the worst thing ever. He believed nobody cared for him and ended it all and I can’t ever bring him back. So please don’t, you can do this, one day at a time. Seriously."

I am a little stressed about the future but finally getting through high school is such a relief, it does generally get better, some people do have to work harder for things to get better and that’s not fair but it CAN get better, I know that sounds generic as hell but I’ve lived it, I never thought I’d live through highschool, I genuinely believed I would end up being another statistic of suicide at my school but after a failed attempt I tried again and got through it all.
