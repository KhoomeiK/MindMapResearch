honesttransgender,fhzlmyk,t1_fhzkmu7,1582003042.0,"But to an extent it's true, that's a good part of the reason that detransitioners exist. Most people who think they're trans experience dysphoria but there are some people who get caught in trying to fit in and that's where detransitioners who resent the trans community come from. I personally believe that a good evaluation and a letter of recommendation isn't bad at all and is actually useful. Of course I'm frustrated that I have to wait another three months to start hormones but it makes sense to try to make sure that people don't detransition. Yes it was their decision but just as we should all have access to transitioning and it should be made a little easier, I admit, they should also have access to transitioning. Saying that they don't deserve empathy will just make trans people look worse. I'm a bit of an idealist I guess but I believe spreading hate isn't going to help anything. I mean look, TERFs are completely founded on hate and an unwillingness to understand what trans people have to deal with on a day to day basis. Be that dysphoria, relationship problems, discrimination, exc. We can't just do the same things to detransitioners, that's how they turn into terfs. If they gain easy access to detransitioning and are informed of why trans people actually transition the majority of them won't become terfs or hate the trans community. Everyone is human and most humans aren't filled with hate, at least not until they have a reason to be."

Something a terf would say is to not give any empathy to trans people or detransitioners. The more empathy and understanding people give each other, especially in the LGBT community, the more conflicts are resolved and things generally work out better. I agree that it isn't right for detransitioners to blame the trans community for making them transition as it is their choice but the girl above me did make some good points and many teens, especially younger teens, don't have a fully developed brain and people can do stupid things if they're desperate to not be alone, even more so at that age."
