I gotta put the self titled last just because I only listen to like 3 songs from there and I'm not a big fan of the production quality on some songs. For example Catch Me If You Can is a great song but could honestly use a remaster to make it hit as hard as it does live."

Now that I've had time away from my loop to clear my head I know for a fact I don't wanna go back when they call and I wanna find something else to stay afloat but I'm not sure what to do. I'm a music producer and I love everything that has to do with music and the arts so I hope one day I can find a way to make myself financially stable doing what I actually enjoy.

I'll take these points you've made here and try to build a progressive mindset. Thank you for the insight!"

unpopularopinion,fnf4duw,t3_g17qii,1586901188.0,"Exactly. This saying is just incredibly misinterpreted because money does put you in positions that make you happy. Therefore money buys happiness. I think the phrase means it doesn't buy happiness as in you going to a store and literally purchasing happiness in a jar.

In another aspect at the end of the day you have to be with yourself and deal with your mind forever so whether you're rich or poor it won't make the difference if you're just a miserable person. Some people will get money and be happy and some people will get money and still find something to be miserable over. I guess that's where the balance lies."
