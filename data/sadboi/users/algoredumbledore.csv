Anxiety,fpbr7th,t3_fnz5n3,1588476706.0,"Hello! I just wanted to share something that's really helped me on my bad days throughout this whole thing - **making a list**.

I'm already someone who finds enjoyment in lists. I love writing them and I love crossing things off as I go. I have a stupid amount of colored pens for the lists I make. It feels organized and comfortable to see things laid out plainly in front of me in little manageable chunks.

Right now, a lot of what's going on around us seems unmanageable. A lot of it is also out of our direct control which can cause anxiety and frustration, even in people who weren't prone to those responses before. Some people here are old friends with their anxiety and some people are experiencing it for the first time. One thing we can all agree on is that it really, really sucks.

On my worst anxiety days (even before all the virus stuff) it could be hard for me to get my thoughts straight and feel any sense of motivation or focus whatsoever. It's so hard to feel like you're living your life when you're trapped in an anxious spiral or weighed down by dread. I know how hard it is to escape that feeling. A one-day-at-a-time mentality can be more helpful than you might realize, especially on those bad days.

**Just focus on one day.**

Don't worry about tomorrow or next week or next month. Sit down in front of a sheet of paper and think only about *today*. What do you *need* to do today and what do you *want* to do today? Write those things down, no matter how small they are. In fact, seek out the small things so you can really see how much you're still accomplishing day-to-day. It might seem silly or stupid, but write it all down. Include things you need to do for work if it's a work day. Cross those things off as you go or at the end of the day.

Today, I needed to take a shower, take out the trash, do a load of laundry, and pay some bills online. I wrote those down. I wanted to watch an episode of a TV show, make pancakes, take a walk outside, text my best friend, and drink more water. I wrote those down too. It might seem dumb to write down something like ""take a shower"" but seriously, if you're in the deepest pits of anxiety it can really seem like a gift to be able to pull your brain away for even a little bit and focus on something as mundane as a shower. When you're going through your list, focus only on the thing you're accomplishing right then and there as much as you can. If you're standing in the shower and finding it hard to focus only on your shower, let your mind think ahead a little bit, but keep it to the concrete list you made. Think about how you will accomplish those things. Think about what else you want to do **today** and might be able to add to the list.

None of us know the future, so to speculate about it with worst case scenarios is extremely detrimental to the anxious mind and causes us to fret over unrealistic outcomes. Ground yourself with only the facts of what you can control - this day in front of you, in which you need to feed the dog or ride your bike or make some eggs for breakfast. Those are all 100% in your control and if you try to focus only on those things you'll be surprised how much better you can feel and how time flies. With every day that passes, **you are getting through this, you are getting closer to feeling better, and there will be better times ahead**.

Lists might not help for everybody, but I thought I'd share since it has helped me so much recently. If it doesn't work for you, I hope you are able to find whatever way you can to focus on the here and now instead of letting your mind wander off into what-ifs or how-longs. You can do this and you're not alone! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Anxiety,fp34rkn,t3_fj2y1a,1588273069.0,"As things start slowing down, some people have shifted their worries to a supposed ""worse second wave"" as the headlines have liked to call it. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine published a paper concerning ""waves"" of pandemics today, and while it doesn't say there definitely won't be a second ""wave"" (they take issue with the term wave in some cases) it does say that after studying 10 past pandemics of respiratory illnesses, only two were found to have more severe second waves - one in 1889-1892 for which documented information is already limited and the 1918-1920 Spanish Flu outbreak, which they mention had many factors that would influence reported severity, including country censorship of case reporting and lack of documentation, that don't apply today.

Of the remaining eight pandemics

* **Five did not have any second wave at all**
* **Two** (H1N1 Swine Flu 2009 and 1957-1958 Influenza) had two ""phases"" of **equal severity** (i.e. no abnormal, scary mutations to suddenly make them worse). For Swine Flu, both phases were categorized as **mild**.
* One (SARS 2003-2004) had multiple phases over the course of **one year**

We also have to look at coronaviruses specifically and what we know about coronaviruses tells us they tend to show seasonality (meaning they're likely to pop up more frequently when other seasonal illnesses do like colds and flu). This does **not** mean it will be worse in severity. There is basically zero evidence that we should expect an increase in severity from the virus itself. This also does **not** mean we'll see an insane explosion of cases come fall/winter as a new ""wave"" crashes down.

The CEBM had this to say in conclusion:

>We do not know for certain whether COVID will recur in phases, or sporadic outbreaks or disappear altogether.  
>  
>Making absolute statements of certainty about ‚Äò second waves‚Äô is unwise, given the current substantial uncertainties and novelty of the evidence. As we cannot see the future and our understanding of this new agent is in its infancy we think preparedness planning should be inspired by robust surveillance, the flexibility of response and rigid separation of suspected or confirmed cases. These measures should stand for all serious outbreaks of respiratory illness.

What we do know is that it will not mutate into some super virus come fall, it will not catch us unaware ever again, and by the end of the year we will have made so much more progress on treatments and vaccine development that we'll be more prepared than ever before to take on any isolated outbreaks or phases in the future.

Anxiety,foeqawq,t3_fnz5n3,1587711169.0,"I've seen a lot of people who are anxious about the uncertainty surrounding day to day life and how long things will be locked down. People are missing friends and family and they're missing the days when they didn't feel afraid to leave their house, go to the grocery store, or pass someone on the street.

These are all valid feelings, but the fear that it will be this way forever, no matter how strong or disruptive, is not based in facts or data or precedence.

It comes from the part of you that doesn't want to lose the people, the places, and the activities you love. That part of you is not an expert on the economy and that part of you is not an epidemiologist, a statistician, or even a voice of reason. That part of you takes what you fear and it amplifies it until it's all you can think about and your heart pounds or your thoughts spiral with what-ifs and worst case scenarios. That part of you doesn't have to tell you the truth of the situation and often times it will not.

Regardless of how many bad days you have and how many times you fall into that hole of anxious thoughts and stretches of worry that this is it, this is how life will be forever now, know that **this will end**. There will be a day where you will feel better and there will be a day where you'll see the people you miss in person, you'll go to a cafe, and you'll walk outside without worrying about being safe from this virus.

For those who haven't seen it, I recommend this article from The New Yorker called [""When SARS Ended""](https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/when-sars-ended) that was written by an editor who was living in Hong Kong in 2003 when SARS swept through the city.

This is written by somebody who experienced loneliness as he was separated from his family for weeks and who worried whether or not the food he ate was likely to give him SARS. This is somebody who wore a mask every time he had to leave the house and saw restaurants, shops, and venues shuttered for extended periods of time. This is also somebody who saw all of that end and saw the world return to how it was.

>The end of *sars* was accompanied by a curious combination of hope and fatigue. We had been living indoors, secluded, behind masks, for so long that at some point it had become normal‚Äîeven boring. I can remember the first time I saw someone wearing a mask, at the start of the outbreak: I had been taking my three-year-old daughter for a walk around Victoria Peak, and she had pointed him out. But I can‚Äôt remember when I first saw someone without one, or when I myself decided to leave mine at home. I suppose that, one day, I must have woken up, got dressed, reached for the N95 as usual, and then thought, Is this really necessary?  
>  
>The government didn‚Äôt tell us to go out‚Äîand, in any case, it couldn‚Äôt have legislated away our fear. Instead, some internal calculation seemed to show that the benefits of living our lives newly outweighed the risks of catching *sars*. I know as I write this that it sounds ridiculous, but it felt as though the virus itself had grown weaker‚Äîas though it had been wounded. It seemed like a miasma had lifted from the city.  
>  
>My family members came back from their exile. Restaurants reopened. The viral spell broke; Hong Kong seemed to wake from a fever dream. There were magical spring days when the sun flooded Victoria Harbor. We talked, in person. The virus had reduced everyone‚Äôs life to a binary‚Äîyou either had it or you didn‚Äôt. Now, there seemed to be seven million different stories.

I wish I could answer that question for you, but I hope you find even a little comfort in the fact that it's not a question that's being pushed off indefinitely. It's probably the biggest question every world leader, medical expert, and scientific advisor is working through right now. When is it safe to allow gatherings? When can we open clothing stores or movie theaters? When will the ""new normal"" start looking more and more like the ""old normal"" again and when can someone feel safe and comfortable going out in their community? These whens are being asked, researched, and evaluated every day around the world and every day we get closer to knowing the answers.

Nobody wants the world to be locked down for any longer than is absolutely necessary. Businesses don't want it, governments don't want it, and the people at home don't want it. We abide by it because it's necessary right now, but **it will go away**. It's not a matter of if, it's when. Always when. We've been wading through the whens this entire pandemic.

It wasn't ""if"" a country would get a case of COVID-19, it was when. It happened.

It wasn't ""if"" we would reach a peak, it is and was when. It happened in places and it's happening in others right now.

It isn't ""if"" we will be able to hang out with friends, visit a movie theater, or just go sit at a coffee shop again, it's when. It will happen.

Take it one day at a time and know, with certainty, that time will pass. This will end. Time doesn't care if you're anxious, depressed, scared, or tired. Whether the days feel like they're dragging or flying by, time passes just the same, and it will continue to do so. You will reach a point where you'll look back and the worst of this for you will be over. You'll be held by your boyfriend again and you'll spend time in the quiet company of your friends.

* Surgeries that were previously on hold to increase hospital capacity are allowed to resume.
* California to increase PCR (nasal swab) testing to 25,000 per day by the end of April and then up to 60,000-80,000 a day in the weeks following. California will add 86 new testing sites to the already 200+ sites across the state.
* California has purchased 1.5 million serological (antibody) tests and is interested in continuing to invest in that direction. Though Newsom encouraged caution and recommends we don't get too attached to the idea that antibody testing will immediately allow us to reopen everything, he did say there is ""a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm"" around serological testing coming from the public and coming from officials and they plan to pursue more study and widespread research there. More data is always better so this is fantastic news.
* California has a large network of tracing and tracking in place to help once positive tests do come in. The state already has experience and infrastructure in place for tracing and tracking diseases like STIs and HIV, and though the scale of tracing and tracking required by COVID-19 is much larger than those infections, he wants people to know we aren't starting from scratch. We don't have to imagine an entirely new system for tracing and tracking but rather expand the ones we already have in place with the experts and trained professionals who already do this daily for other diseases. The state will also train 10,000 additional healthcare and health sector employees at the local and state level to support this effort.
* The state saw a 0.2 percent decrease in hospitalizations and a 1.8 percent decrease in ICU numbers.

For people who don't live in California, I hope it can be helpful to know these are the kinds of things state and local officials are looking at, thinking about, and planning for in every single state right now. No one is sitting on their hands and waiting around. California is working with other states and hopefully more states announce similar plans soon!

Anxiety,fnq3n5r,t3_fj2y1a,1587157054.0,"Hello! üëãI'm a bit earlier this Friday than previous Fridays, but I'm back again to remind you that you made it through another week! A lot has happened over the last week and sometimes the pace of change can be overwhelming. We have data on clinical trials of potential treatments beginning to come in, new cases and hospitalizations are slowing in many locations, some countries are beginning to relax restrictions on open businesses and other countries and regions are making public plans to do the same in the future. There really is a lot to celebrate right now. Every day the light at the end of the tunnel gets brighter.

Let's start with a study from the Oxford Centre for Evidenced-Based Medicine that suggests COVID-19 is behaving less like a traditional pandemic illness and more like a severe outbreak of a seasonal virus. This might seem obvious to some people, as we've had coronaviruses circulating seasonally in our communities for decades. The difference between those coronaviruses, which on any given year account for 10-30% of respiratory illnesses in adults, including the common cold (Source: [a research paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759815) from The Journal of the American Medical Association), and COVID-19 is that COVID-19 is new and we still have a lot of questions. Its novelty is why we must implement measures to protect our at-risk communities until more is known about severity, spread, and immunity.

It's worth remembering that our current response to COVID-19 (social distancing, business closures, increased vigilance in regards to personal hygiene) is **not** due to it being highly severe but because it would be irresponsible to those who are in at-risk groups to let a new virus spread unabated before we know the best ways to manage and treat it.

But back to the study from the CEBM. Researchers looked at the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic in 2009, as well as historical data on pandemics in general, and found that COVID-19 doesn't line up with pandemics of the past. In most pandemics, younger people are more likely to develop severe complications and die from the pandemic disease than if they were to catch a seasonal illness like influenza. To put it plainly, in most cases a pandemic illness will kick your ass way more than the flu or a cold and it doesn't care how young or fit you are. Now, months after we began tracking the spread of the virus and gathering data, COVID-19's risk for otherwise healthy young adults and adults lines up pretty well with your typical seasonal illness. It might kick your ass while you're sick, but it's going to do so like the flu or a cold is going to, depending on the individual (not to mention the question of how many asymptomatic cases are out there).

>In a pandemic, the proportion of deaths among the young should increase (See [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9652423/) and [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19423872/)), and [several studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841239/) have further demonstrated this age shift in deaths to younger populations.¬† In a 1918 scenario, the major prevention strategies are to target [younger people](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18558871/) to minimize the loss to expected years of life. An analysis of three other pandemics over the last century also suggests pandemic viruses¬† cause excess mortality in ‚Äò[unusually young populations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20352125/).‚Äô

The study goes on to say that as of April 4th, in countries and U.S. states with at least 250 COVID-19 deaths, over 95% of deaths occurred in people >60 years old, and 50% in people >80 years old. These are a good chunk of the people we're trying to protect right now and it illustrates the fact that this virus is targeting the same people seasonal flus and other seasonal viruses target - the elderly and the chronically ill.

>The data support the theory that the current epidemic is a late seasonal effect in the Northern¬† Hemisphere on the back of a mild ILI season. The age structure of those most affected does not fit the evidence from previous pandemics.

This should serve more as a reminder that there are people we need to protect right now while more research is conducted, but this is not the black death descending upon humanity. It is likely a seasonal illness that will be here to stay, but once we have treatments and a vaccine it will not trouble us the way it is troubling us now.

In other news, there have been some people worrying about supply chains and food shortages. A few meat processing plants have shut down for deep cleaning after workers tested positive and, as the media does, an influx of articles poured in that alarmed some people and gave them a new worry to occupy their brains - will we run out of food at grocery stores? No, we will not run out of food at grocery stores.

An April 15th article from Forbes reported that demand for food from grocery stores and food banks has increased due to more people staying home and cooking meals themselves. This new demand, coupled with waves of panic buying, has created pockets of temporary, local shortages in things like eggs, meat, dairy, and of course, our lord and savior, toilet paper. I say ""temporary"" and ""local"" shortages because it really does depend on when you check the store and where you live. It is variable and things that are sold out are likely to come in stock within a few days.

The Forbes article says **any food shortages related to plant closures or supply chain delays would cause these kinds of localized, temporary gaps in stock**, but that's what they are. Localized and temporary. The meat shelf will not be empty for weeks on end and it's likely your trips to the store will still result in you finding the majority of items on your list. Our access to food will not be gone, but our access to variety is likely to differ based on location and timeline. There might not be a specific cut of beef or variety of frozen chicken product for a short period of time, for instance, but beef and chicken will be available.

>There‚Äôs plenty of food in the U.S. with [hundreds of millions of pounds of meat](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/business/coronavirus-food-supply.html) in cold storage, the challenge is the lack of processing options (with facilities like Smithfield closing), which could result in less product variety, ‚ÄúWe have a lot of pork, we have a lot of chicken, we have a lot of beef in cold storage,"" said Steve Meyer, a Kerns and Associates economist to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/business/meat-supply-coronavirus/index.html). ""We can draw on that should we have some shortages.""  
>  
>The food retail system is a [$1.46 trillion](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-service-industry/market-segments/) industry in the United States with American grocery stores bringing in [$650 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/grocery-stores-carry-40000-more-items-than-they-did-in-the-1990s-2017-06-07) a year.

While there may be a lack of options for all the reasons mentioned above, shoppers today will likely walk away from grocery stores with everything they need‚Äîexcept, maybe, toilet paper.¬†

Anxiety,fng01nj,t1_fnfz2q0,1586919189.0,"One thing I've seen overwhelming agreement over is that while transmission from surfaces is **possible** it is way less likely than direct contact with an infected person, and likely somewhat prolonged contact at that.

I'm not talking about the guy who passes within 3 feet of you for one second as you walk by each other on the sidewalk. I'm talking about the potentially infected person who lives with you and you're sitting in a room with them breathing the same air all day, or the potentially infected person at the grocery store who ignores social distancing to chat with someone for five minutes face to face.

The fastest way to become infected is to inhale droplets from an infected person's respiratory system. If you're staying a good distance from people and washing your hands, you're really not giving the virus much of a chance at all.

Your chance of getting a virus from brief touch contact of a surface (which, the virus immediately becomes less effective the second it touches a surface and eventually become inactive) and then brief touch contact of something like a straw, fork, whatever that goes into your mouth is so insanely low that I really do hope you don't worry about it."
Anxiety,fnfyj3w,t1_fnfxtaq,1586918227.0,"I do understand that. It is very hard to maintain that level of vigilance when it's not what we're used to or when we're worried and scared, but I can assure you that something as small as touching your straw and then putting it in your mouth will not sicken you. Consuming the virus (whether it may be on food or utensils in trace amounts) is not a means of infection. Period.

Anxious people have a tendency to overdo it. Yes, be vigilant, but that doesn't mean taking it to such extremes where you're worrying yourself sick over touching a straw. Experts do NOT agree that that level of alarm is warranted, but anxious minds will do as anxious minds do. I'm familiar with it as my mind sometimes takes something and runs with it in a bad direction before I have time to stop it.

But maybe limit your Reddit time specifically? If you desperately need help (not reassurance) then we are not the ones who can provide it as most of us are not professionals. It's okay to reach out with worries every now and then but if it's truly impacting your mental health this often I would recommend speaking to a doctor or counselor."

The department has developed a guide, which is available on its¬†[website](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/insects-pests-and-weeds/insects/hornets/trapping), for beekeepers and residents to build their own traps. Traps are plastic bottles filled with a mixture of orange juice and rice cooking wine.

Anxiety,fn1ot92,t3_fj2y1a,1586566668.0,"Hi again! üëã It's Friday evening in the U.S. and yep, you made it through another week! Maybe it felt like it flew by or maybe every day was a slow crawl for you, but the destination was the same - another week closer to better days.

It's worth a reminder that every single day is another day full of data that helps us narrow down the most effective treatments and really get a better understanding of the virus itself. We have so many questions still and likely will for a while to come, but we've answered some questions too.

Does social distancing work? **YES**. This has been the resounding answer from medical and scientific experts around the world as we've seen cases plateauing and even best case predictions being remodeled to show vast improvements in the number of people who will avoid infection or beat the virus. The current estimation for COVID-19 deaths in the United States is roughly **40% lower** than the _best_ case scenario originally modeled by experts. These models are being updated daily and show that the hardest time to come up with these kinds of figures is on the fly in the middle of a pandemic. So if you see something that scares you, know that it's constantly in flux and in almost every case likely to be lower when all is said and done.

Can we tell who already had it and recovered? Yes, thanks to **antibody tests**! We've come far in the last week here, as there are already labs in the U.S. joining in on the antibody trials other countries have begun to try to gauge the true spread of the virus by finding people who might have been asymptomatic or mildly ill and recovered without going to a doctor or getting a formal test. This does at least two good things for us.

One, we're able to see who might already have immunity to the virus (we're not yet 100% sure having the antibodies makes you immune but if it follows the pattern of many, many other viruses that should be the case) and those people could take on a more active role in the healthcare industry and in the economy as a whole in a much safer way. If that cold you had in March turned out to be COVID-19 and now you have some level of immunity to the virus, it's much easier to allow you to interact with sick or at risk groups or resume a gradually more normal day to day life as restrictions are lifted. If you're a healthcare worker who asymptomatically became infected and have since recovered, you could fill more at-risk roles for people who don't have that extra immunity boost. There is still a lot of research needed here, but it's so promising to see countries placing priority on antibody testing alongside vaccine development and treatment trials.

Two, the antibody data gives us a much clearer view of how much the virus has spread and if any pockets of herd immunity already exist (multiple researchers have suggested this might be the case in California! Source: [ABC News on Stanford study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abc7news.com/amp/coronavirus-covid-19-herd-immunity-california/6091220/)). As we find more mild and asymptomatic cases that were never reported, we start to see the real percentage of cases that become serious and need hospital care and the real fatality rates, both of which will drop as these cases are discovered.

I know a lot of this isn't new to people who frequent this thread but sometimes a reminder is nice that people with years of experience and specialized training are looking into these avenues of data gathering so we can get as complete a picture of this disease as we can. There is not a single second of a single day right now where there aren't tests being run, trails being conducted, and data being recorded and analyzed all in one single effort - to grind this virus into the ground and save lives in the process.

We're already 1/3 of the way through April, believe it or not. Some countries and states and cities are getting ready to say ""the worst is behind us"" and some are a week or two off from being able to say the same. It isn't some far off goal now. It's happening. We will still have tough days but it will not last forever.

You're going to feel better and you're going to be stronger when this is over.

Anxiety,fmd9zwo,t3_fj2y1a,1585962718.0,"Hello! üëãIt's Friday evening again in the U.S. and that means you've made it through another week! I'm sure you've had good days and bad days and plenty of ups and downs in between - we all have and you're not alone in feeling like you're operating at less than your best right now.

Keep in mind, as always, that this is *temporary.*

You will feel better. Cities and countries will slow down and recover. The world will open up again. For now, we're going to continue with our social distancing so we can keep the good trends going (lowering the burden on healthcare, protecting those who are most at-risk, and keeping an eye on our own mental well-being in the meantime).

Let's bring up a few things while we're here that might help you out. You didn't realize you were getting a novel here, did you?

First, even the countries hit the hardest by the virus (especially Italy and Spain) are beginning to show statistical data that they're rapidly reaching or are already in their peak period as growth of both new cases and daily deaths has **plateaued** (Source: [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)). What this means is that there is good evidence that social distancing and quarantine measures are helping these areas get to the point where we should soon start seeing those figures decrease day by day. With fewer new cases comes fewer hospitalizations and less stress on the healthcare system. With less stress on the healthcare system, more people who need specialized care have access to that care and healthcare workers can get a little bit of well-deserved relief. This will happen to every location, so if you're in an especially hard-hit region right now or you've seen some scary prediction headline about peaks for your area in the next 1-2 weeks, know that it will pass and the more people follow social distancing and self-care guidelines (stay home when you don't feel well and wash your hands!) the lower those peaks could be. We're not out of it yet, but there is an end in sight. Every day gets us closer!

Second, with more time and more data comes more accurate estimations! This week, the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) updated their best-guess estimate of the Infection Fatality Rate (or IFR, the % of people who die out of *everyone* who gets infected with a virus) to be **0.1-0.26%**. That means out of everyone who gets the virus - **including those with pre-existing conditions and the elderly** \- it is expected that anywhere from 0.1% to 0.26% will die. They point out that it is just impossible to 100% accurately predict these kinds of figures *in the middle of a pandemic* and that only after everything has calmed down will we begin to see the real numbers, which will certainly be lower than current estimates. (Source: [CEBM](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/))

>We could make a simple estimation of the IFR as 0.26%, based on halving the lowest boundary of the CFR prediction interval. However, the considerable uncertainty over how many people have the disease means an IFR of 0.26 is likely an overestimate. In Swine flu, the IFR ended up as 0.02%, fivefold less than the lowest estimate during the outbreak (the lowest estimate was 0.1% in the 1st ten weeks of the outbreak). In Iceland, where the most testing per capita has occurred, the¬† IFR lies between. 0.01% and 0.19%.  
>  
>Taking account of historical experience, trends in the data, increased number of infections in the population at largest, and potential impact of misclassification of deaths gives a presumed estimate for the COVID-19 IFR between 0.1% and 0.26%.\*

Third, the amount of testing each country is doing is absolutely skyrocketing, which is fantastic for understanding this virus. The side effect to this is that we will be seeing way more confirmed new cases coming in over the coming weeks, but please try not to equate more confirmed cases with a sudden explosion of the virus. Viruses don't work that way and when you see that one area's case count rose rapidly from one day to the next, it is almost certainly because more and more tests are being performed and a higher number of results are coming in. **More cases does not mean the virus is exploding, it means we're finally seeing the cases that were already there.** Take solace in the fact that more testing means we have more data and knowledge to put to work on cures, vaccines, and general understanding of the true severity and spread. (Source: [ourworldindata.org/covid-testing](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing)).

Fourth, not only are supply lines doing well, even the effects of the waves of panic buying are disappearing. Stores are stocked in all countries and no one is going hungry due to the virus, not even in the hardest hit areas. A bit anecdotally, Tesco in the UK had this to say about grocery store supply lines just 3 days ago (Source: [Tesco](https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2020/our-latest-response-to-covid-19-a-message-to-customers-from-dave-lewis-tesco-ceo/)):

>In fresh food, our stock levels have returned to almost normal levels, with plenty of fruit and vegetables available. In packaged groceries, the recovery will take a few more days ‚Äì most stores will have stock of just about everything, but in a few product areas we may still have some gaps.

This really is a waiting game at this point, which can be so frustrating, mind-numbing, anxiety-filled, or worrying. Some people get scared because they worry there is no end in sight, that the disruption to their lives will go on indefinitely. That is not the case. We are disrupting life now to protect those who need protecting and things will get better. You will still have those bad hours or days, but you're allowed to have times of vulnerability.

Just try to keep yourself occupied when you can and don't slack off on allowing yourself some time to feel as good as you can. Sit in the sun. Watch a TV series or a couple of movies. Read a book. Do some pushups and stretch your body. Cook something you really love to eat (I'm impatiently waiting for some homemade lasagna to finish!). **You will get through this and you will be stronger for it**, even if you don't feel that to be true right now. Your brain is not a medical expert or an economics guru. When it tells you to be scared or to lose hope, it's not coming from a place of knowledge because all of the knowledge and data points to you making it out the other side of this a better, more resilient human being. Be kind to each other! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Anxiety,flpimtg,t3_fj2y1a,1585360362.0,"A surgeon named Dr. Wesley Schooler in Santa Barbara, California (as well as his wife and son) tested positive for the virus and spoke about their experience.

Dr. Schooler felt ""nausea, chills and discomfort"" at first and because he works in healthcare and people at his clinic were being tested after having flu-like symptoms, he went ahead and got tested. It took 6 days for the results to come back with the positive diagnosis, so he spent much of his symptomatic time not knowing he had the virus and just resting as you normally would with a cold/flu.

""That weekend he then developed more discomfort symptoms and diarrhea but assumed it was contracted from his son who had a stomach virus.""

He never had a cough or fever, mostly just stomach discomfort and chills/aches for about a week. His family's symptoms were ""a cough, dizziness, short of breath and a low grade fever."" His son had a milder case (they don't mention his age but I assume he's not an adult from the way the article is written).

One thing he wants people to know is that
""Symptoms are variable. 80 percent will have vague mild symptoms like malaise, headache, nausea. Fatigue and malaise seem very common.""

Just another anecdote about the mildness of a majority of cases and the importance of staying home when you feel sick, even if you don't have a cough or fever! We'll all get through this together üí™‚ù§Ô∏è

It means they're not testing as many young people because tests are still primarily being performed on hospitalized or at-risk patients, of which most are going to be older since it is less likely for someone, say, in their 20s or 30s to require hospital care for this virus than a 60, 70, 80+ year old."
Anxiety,fl1veqb,t3_fj2y1a,1584737110.0,"Some patient recovery stories. I know hearing from people who have recovered or are recovering is very helpful, because it shows both that thousands of people are literally recovering from this daily and gives a voice to the milder cases.

I think it's also important to point out the common advice across everyone is to make sure you take care of yourself, which can be so hard when you're worried or scared. Trust me, I know. Eat enough food that's good for you, go for a walk or get some exercise if you're not sick, make sure you get a good amount of sleep, and try to focus on managing your stress levels so your immune system is up and running at 100% and kicking ass! So much anxiety comes from what is out of our control but taking care of you, right now, is absolutely in your control and it's something your body and mind will appreciate ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Tia Davis of Hazel Crest, Illinois**

>They can treat a symptom. So if I have a fever, they could treat it with Tylenol. If I have a cough, they could treat you with cough medicine. But my body has to fight it off. So I have to take the time to rest, make sure that I'm trying to keep down as much food as I can and let my body do its job.

>It's a lot scarier when you see it on the TV or when you read about it than what it actually is.

>I'm quite baffled as to why people are interested at all. I'm just this guy that's got a positive diagnosis with no symptoms stuck at home. But I guess people are fearful, and I'm sad about that. I think I'm proof that even if you catch the virus, you can be just fine."

Just knowing there is some hope in sight for Italians, who have been so strong through this, is worth posting. I hope it's two weeks at the latest and within 14 days people can begin to have more hope and see improvements in their home! This doesn't last forever. It might last longer than we want, because we want it to be as short as possible, but it ends. People recover and life inches back towards normal every single day. Even as more restrictions are put into place, they're done in an effort to make sure a more familiar normal returns to us sooner rather than later and more people are protected in the meantime!"

Anxiety,fl0socn,t1_fl0130r,1584714874.0,"It mostly comes down to money and need. After the outbreak, we didn't have human cases (or many). There's no money in developing a vaccine for a disease no one is catching and spending that kind of money as an investment for MAYBE helping with some mystery future disease isn't a priority when they could be working on cures and treatments for diseases that kill many, many more people like heart diseases, cancers, genetic diseases, etc."

That statistic will vary from day to day (including going up some days and down others) and doesn't represent total number of active cases, but they're testing more and more people each day and if there is a day with a lower % positive, that means they tested a bunch of people and more came back negative than the day before, which is a good thing."
