sleeptrain,fqnteyo,t3_gjugpk,1589501055.0,"Ferber worked very well for us. My son was 4 months old the night we started. Before sleep training, he would wake up and nurse 2-3 times per night. We had been “bedtime” training him and using some of the ideas of Ferber since he was about 2.5 months old, so we had a pretty good bedtime routine and LO could go to bed drowsy but awake most nights. 

We sleep trained and night weaned cold turkey. My husband did the checks because I couldn’t go in and not pick up the baby.

It took us 2 nights before LO slept through. Night 1, he woke at 10pm and cried 10 minutes, 1am and cried 15 minutes, and 4am and cried 5 minutes. Night 2 was very similar, but slightly longer bouts of crying. 

Night 3, he slept through. He has slept through every night since. He occasionally wakes up and fusses for a few minutes at night, but we don’t go in (unless he’s stuck in the bars of his crib), and he always puts himself back to sleep within three or four minutes of mild fussing. 

Bedtime itself is pretty good. Sometimes he’ll cry for 10-15 minutes at bedtime if he’s overtired, but we don’t even do checks anymore and he eventually settles."

I’ve noticed he’s become a lot more confident in his exploring since I’ve been able to leave him alone for a few minutes.

newborns,fpi24ts,t3_gdeq8r,1588632173.0,"Looks like you’ve gotten a few good answers but here’s my advice. My LO is 7 months old. 

- Feed on demand. Their bellies are so little and empty so fast. Cluster feeding also helps your milk come in. If my son cried and wasn’t wet, I’d just give him my boob. Either he’d be hungry and eat, or use me as a pacifier and fall asleep. 

- Routine won’t happen for a while, which sucks. But your baby will have a natural pattern that you’ll figure out. There are lots of baby tracking apps that can help you discover your child’s patterns and make it easier to predict what your baby needs. Around 6 weeks, things started to improve a bit routine-wise. By around 12 weeks, he had fallen into pretty predictable eat and sleep patterns. Now at 7 months, he’s like clockwork. It’ll happen eventually, but newborns just need everything on demand. 

- I was also so freaked out about the pacifier and breastfeeding issues, but I caved and gave one around 5 days. My son never really liked the pacifier, and hasn’t used one for a few months now, but even after giving one pretty early, I didn’t have any latching issues. Honestly, do what you need to do. I frequently would just let my son use me as a pacifier til he fell asleep deeply enough that I could put him down. 

You’ll get the hang of things and you’re doing great! The newborn phase is so hard, but it goes so fast and before long you won’t remember a time before you had your baby. I absolutely hated the newborn phase but things improved quickly and now my son is my world. Enjoy the snuggles and cuddles and your baby’s beautiful face when she sleeps on you. It goes so fast. At 4am you might be wishing for her to just grow up already, but now I wish I could go back to those times.

Edit: forgot to mention, trust yourself! There are lots of things I don’t do “by the book” but if it works for you and it’s safe, go for it. The only thing I don’t compromise on is safe sleep and car seat safety. But other than that, trust your instincts. Don’t want to sleep train at 4 months? Then don’t. Want to wear your baby all the time? Do it. It won’t spoil her. Want to formula feed because you’re exhausted and hate breastfeeding? Do it (formula is just as good as bm - I switched at 4 months). No parent is perfect but the most important thing is that your baby is safe and loved. If she’s safe and loved, your baby will forgive you if you’re not the perfect parent."
homeautomation,fos3xd4,t1_forr9tv,1588023524.0,"Yeah, I’d probably just leave the other switch the way it is and not even replace the second one. I’m just wondering if the dimmer will still work. I can’t think of a reason it wouldn’t, but I didn’t know if anyone has experience with it"
baby,foomzzb,t3_g8d8ou,1587942235.0,"Here’s the thing - there will be no perfect time. You might just be making excuses, or you might have genuine reasons for not wanting to be a parent yet. But you need to figure out which it is.

We decided to start trying for a baby when we were 80% sure it was the right time. Because we knew we would never get to 100%. There were always reasons not to: House projects, promotions at work, money concerns, friends’ upcoming weddings.

That being said, if you’re not sure you want kids and you’re just doing it because your husband wants kids, then you need to really think about it and have an open dialogue about what’s important to you both. Having a baby changes everything. I didn’t realize how much my life would change and it really took me by surprise. Your life is no longer your own. Your baby will dictate your activities, your schedule, how much you sleep, how clean your house is. Everything becomes the baby’s. Every aspect of your life. Eventually, you get some of it backs your child grows and become more independent, but the initial change was a huge shock to my system. 

I do absolutely love my son, though. I love seeing him learn and grow. I love how much he loves me. I love when I’m the only thing that can comfort him. Even on days when I’m exhausted and frustrated and just want ten minutes to myself, my son is worth it. 

So, the only advice I can give is that you need to be honest with yourself and figure out exactly where you stand. Are you apprehensive because you’re nervous about having kids even though you really want them? Or do you not want kids but are trying to make your husband happy, but you’re making excuses to put it off because you know deep down that kids aren’t right for you? If it’s the former, just take the dive and do it when you feel mostly ready, but don’t wait for everything to be perfect because it never will be. If it’s the latter, you need to be open with your husband and see if you can reconcile the differences in what you want in life."

I’ve installed a 3-way switch using one of the Kasa switches in a different fixture, but that one didn’t have a dimmer so I wasn’t sure how it would work.

WhitePeopleTwitter,foa1b6r,t1_fo9yrbz,1587637210.0,"Yep. When I was pregnant with my son I used to call him “my little parasite” (in a joking, loving way). When I was breastfeeding, he still felt like a parasite, but I enjoyed the bonding time with my parasite. Now he’s 6 months and formula fed and more like a barnacle that’s always stuck to me. I don’t mind though because he’s an adorable little barnacle and I like snuggling the barnacle."
newborns,fo5apu8,t1_fo4h0ai,1587521220.0,"Same boat. My mom was supposed to be daycare when my husband went back after paternity leave. We didn’t see her for a few weeks, then made the decision to include her in our circle. Working from home with the baby was nearly impossible for me, and I needed the help. Plus, she missed her grandson who is growing up so fast. My mom is under 60, lives alone, and is healthy. She’s able to come over and see my son under the condition that she doesn’t see anyone else (except for errands like groceries). 

The way I see it, it’s no different than if she were in our household. It’s actually been really nice, because we’ve been able to go to each other’s houses to get a break from the monotony of our own homes."

newborns,fo5a6a5,t3_g5m358,1587520871.0,"We’ve been seeing my mom. We stayed away for about three weeks, and then I needed the help at home (husband still works outside of the house and I’m now WFH).

My mom is 57, no health conditions, and lives alone. We’re more of a risk to her than she is to us, because my husband is still going to work. I told her that, and told her that she can make her own decision and that I’d be okay with it either way. She’s been coming over to see the baby and help me while I work under the condition that she doesn’t have any contact with anyone else (except essential errands, which we’re doing too). If she does, then it’s another 2 weeks before she’s seeing my son. 

My baby is also 6 months old, so he’s not a newborn anymore. I think if he was a newborn with a weaker immune system, I would be a lot more worried."

newborns,fo1gdlr,t3_g4wmpo,1587432708.0,"I had been back at work for 3 weeks when the school where I teach closed. My husband’s paternity leave ended at the beginning of April, and he works in a restaurant so he’s working out of the house. This is my third week working from home with the baby.

Any work that I can do after hours, I do at night when my husband gets home or during nap time. I’m only required to be “live” with my students three times per week for 30 minutes each time. Today, my son sat with me while I video chatted with a student. I just gave him puffs to keep him busy and quiet! During meetings, I keep my mic on mute, I put him in his exersaucer or doorway jumper and he’ll stay busy.

I record my teaching videos during nap time, or at night when baby is asleep. My husband has two days per week off, and I get a lot done on those days.

During my work day, the only things that I have to do real-time are answer emails and live “office hours” video chats. Emails are easy to do with the baby around, and my students have enjoyed seeing my baby when he’s there for office hours.

It’s not easy but it’s doable, and so many people are in the same circumstances so I think most people understand if you’re sitting in a Zoom meeting with a baby on your lap."

baby,fn1gtcb,t3_fy9qh6,1586561711.0,"I found that baby classes are like 50% breastfeeding propaganda, and there’s some evidence that using pacifiers can make breastfeeding a little more difficult. It’s for the breastfeeding reason that people discourage use before 3 weeks, but in general there’s nothing unsafe about giving them from birth. 

Some hospitals still give pacifiers to newborns. In my personal experience, giving a pacifier at one week didn’t change anything with nursing. They also have been shown to decrease likelihood of SIDS.

Here’s my unsolicited parenting advice: cut yourself some slack when it comes to doing things “by the book”.  You will break all sorts of rules when it comes to raising your child, and that’s okay. As a FTM, I wanted to breastfeed for a year. At 3 months, it just wasn’t working anymore for a bunch of reasons, and we started introducing formula. I felt SO guilty from all the “breast is best” stuff out there. But formula turned out to be the right choice for my family and LO is doing well on it. I’ve broken lots of other rules too. My son moved to his own crib at 10 weeks instead of 6 months, and we all sleep better now. My son occasionally napped in his swing or bouncer.

Trust yourself and your decisions. Do what works for you, as long as your child is safe. If you’re really concerned about whether or not your choice is safe, call your pediatrician. Becoming a parent for the first time is an awesome but terrifying experience, because there’s so much pressure to do everything “right”. But you won’t do everything right, and that’s okay. If your baby is safe, fed, cared for, and loved, the you’re doing everything right."

She said if he’s strong enough to get himself into that position, he’s strong enough to get himself out. And it might not seem like there’s breathing room, but there is probably space under his nose. 

If you keep flipping him, he’s just going to keep flipping back over. You won’t sleep. It looks like you have something that monitors his breathing, so maybe that can give you peace of mind. I have an Owlet for my son and it definitely helped me relax when he was belly sleeping. 

My son is 6 months now and has been sleeping on his belly since 10 weeks when he first rolled back to belly (he was an early roller). He slept face down for about two weeks, then decided it was more comfortable to sleep with his butt straight up in the air and his head to the side!"

sleeptrain,flpcjl0,t3_fq52z8,1585356336.0,"Sounds just like my little guy when he was 4 months. He was waking around the same times you said. Pediatrician said he didn’t need to eat at night anymore and recommended Ferber. It took 2 nights of hell, but on the third night he slept 12 hours. He has slept through the night every night since, and that was two months ago. 

I was worried about him being hungry, but his pediatrician said it’s like an adult waking up hungry in the night. You might want a snack, but you don’t need it and you’ll be fine til morning. His nutritional needs are met during the day. Even though he ate, he was still waking out of habit. 

Im not much help with naps. My little guy was also a 40-minute napper. Just recently (he’s about 6 months now) he’s started taking 90 minute naps instead of 40. We just let him nap when he’s tired, and it’s pretty easy to tell when he’s tired."

Hang in there. For now, just survive. Do what works. Rock and nurse to sleep. Let the dishes pile up and take naps when baby finally sleeps. Put the baby in a swing or bouncer and watch Netflix.

teaching,fktsuxe,t1_fkts6wd,1584533514.0,"I’ve been making YouTube videos for my students (I keep them unlisted so you need the link to watch it) and I post them in the Classroom stream. Depending on how old your students are, you can use it as a discussion tool where they can make posts and reply to each other. My kids (3-5th grade) don’t quite have the maturity level to handle that, so I tend to turn that feature off. 

The best thing about it, in my opinion, is how easily it integrates with Google Suite. In my actual classroom, I often have my students work on collaborative Google Slides presentations. One huge limitation of Classroom is the inability to have group assignments. You can either have the entire class edit the same doc, or make a copy for each student. When I do group work, I set the docs/slides to “students can edit” and then I just monitor to make sure the kids are only editing their group’s document. I’m not doing much group work while we’re doing remote learning, though. 

The topics feature in the class work page has been very valuable for our remote learning days. I’ve been making topics for each day of remote learning, and posting 2-3 assignments for my students to complete. That way they know exactly what to complete that day.

If you have specific questions, feel free to PM me! I’ve used it a ton and I’m pretty familiar with most of its features, but it’s tough to list everything you can do with it.

If you’re looking for more interactive assignments from home, I do have a few suggestions of other things you can use. 

I’m using Flipgrid a lot on remote learning days. Flipgrid is a video discussion tool where you can post a topic, and students reply with a short video. They can also reply to each other in video format. 

Quizlet is an online flash card website, that can turn vocabulary sets into interactive games for students to practice vocabulary.

I’m guessing you’re probably already familiar with Kahoot which is an interactive quiz game, but they also have a single player mode now where students can play the quiz on their own.

I thought I’d miss the ability to comfort him with a breast, but I’ve found new ways to do it. Now when he gets startled or bumps himself and needs to be comforted, he nuzzles into my neck while I hold him close. I like the hugs more than nursing him.

Formula has made it easier to feed him anywhere and at any time. I don’t have to be stuck to a wall pumping. My husband can feed him as easily as I can. When I’m at work and my husband takes him out, he doesn’t have to worry about finding a place to warm a bottle (LO drinks room temp formula).

I found formula feeding to be so freeing, and I really don’t miss breastfeeding at all. I’m glad I had that experience for four months, but switching to formula turned out to be the absolute right choice for my family."

The only solace that I can find is that this is a national problem, and the more people affected, the more help there will (hopefully) be. There’s already a bill that passed the House guaranteeing 2/3 pay to anyone with job loss due to the pandemic. 

Also, I have to remind myself that I am lucky if the only fallout we have from this pandemic is financial. So many are losing loved ones, so I’m trying to keep it in perspective.

Last night I was surprised he flopped around for so long because we could barely keep him awake during his last bottle before bedtime. I wonder if maybe the short times he fell asleep while eating were enough of a nap that he wasn’t tired anymore once he got in his crib. 
 
His daytime sleep is usually between 3-3.5 hours. He’ll usually do one long nap (1.5-2 hours) and 2 short naps (usually 40 minutes on the dot). We haven’t really tried to get him on a schedule for naps and tend to follow his natural schedule. Do you think nap training could help?"

newborns,fjbqqjn,t3_fc4zeq,1583199357.0,"It gets better. It gets SO much better. And sooner than you’d expect.

I had that EXACT same feeling. I hadn’t thought of it as homesickness, but now that you phrase it that way, that is exactly what I was feeling. In my own experience, I think that feeling was missing my old life. I missed when it was just me and my husband. I missed doing things on my schedule. I missed sleeping. I missed spontaneous nights out. 

Also, babies are sort of potatoes when they’re that tiny. Very loud, needy potatoes. You don’t know each other yet. And they’re not really that rewarding yet. No smiles, no cooing, not much interaction at all.

At one week, your LO hasn’t learned how to sleep. You’re probably up all night, every night. And all day. And you’re still in pain from giving birth. You may even resent your little one. 

The constant nursing is difficult but it doesn’t not last forever. Cluster feeding sucks but it happens for such a short time. If you’re really tired and can’t get any sleep, ask someone to watch the baby and bring her to you when she’s hungry. Then, nurse side lying and you can probably sleep through the nursing session. Just have someone stay with you to keep an eye on her. When you’re done feeding her, have your support person take her back. I got some really good naps in this way. My mom would watch my son and stay with me while I nursed in my sleep. Or, if your baby will take a bottle, consider pumping and having someone feed expressed milk. 

And just know, this is all normal and it will pass very soon. Believe it or not, you may miss this time someday. 

I did not love my son when I first had him. I resented him. I didn’t feel like he was mine. I didn’t like how he had changed my life. I didn’t like that he kept me up all night. Sure, I cared about him and I felt protective, but I wasn’t too fond of him. I joked with my husband about giving him up for adoption, but I was only half joking. 

For me, part of it was sleep deprivation, part was difficult adjusting, and part was PPD. 

It gets better. My son is now 5 months and he is my world. At 2 weeks, he’d stare into my eyes. He started smiling at 3 weeks. At 6 or so weeks, he “woke up” and was much more aware of me and his surroundings. At 10 weeks, he rolled over and started moving around more. At 12 weeks, he laughed at silly noises I would make at him. At 3 months, he’d respond when I sang his favorite songs. At 4 months, he got very interested in his toys. Also at 4 months, he started sleeping 12 hours through the night. He’s awesome now. When I get home from work, his face lights up and he giggles. He smiles at me when he wakes up in the morning. He is my favorite person, and I can’t believe there was a time when I felt like I didn’t want him.

And you’ll get your life back, too. It’ll be a different sort of normal, but it will start to be normal. You’ll feel like yourself again. When your body heals from birth, you’ll start to feel human. The baby will start getting into a feeding routine soon. If you’re able to introduce bottles soon, you can start going out for a little while without baby. As soon as you feel comfortable and baby can be fed without you there, you can have someone babysit and go out for a night. My husband and I went on an overnight trip a few weeks ago and left our LO with my mom. I felt like a person again. I’m back at work, and that helped me feel like my own person again.

We have our new ways of doing things now. We play so much. We have dance parties in the kitchen. We listen to music and sing together. We go for walks. We make silly faces together. And, we do things my husband and I enjoy. We go out for dinner, with or without the baby. We go shopping. We go to breweries and drink beer while wearing the baby in the baby carrier. We go to our friends’ parties and they play pass-the-baby while we enjoy ourselves. Life changes when you have a baby, but it’s not over. You can still do the things you enjoy, and you’ll find new things that you can enjoy as a family. 

When I was struggling in the beginning, some people would tell me “get used to it, this is your life now,” or “welcome to parenthood,” when I expressed how I was feeling. If people do this to you, don’t listen to it. There are so many positives to parenthood, but it takes a while to adjust. It will start getting better soon.

And if it doesn’t start getting better, talk to your healthcare provider about PPD. There’s no shame in needing a little help to get feeling better. PPD is so common but there is help available if you need it. 

I hated being a mom for the first two weeks of it, and then it slowly started getting better. I promise you, this time will go fast. It will get so much better, and soon you’ll wonder how you ever lived without that tiny person you made. 

Feel free to PM me if you want to talk. When I read your post, my heart ached for you because I remember feeling that way. And it has gotten so, so much better since then.

ETA: I forgot to mention this, but what helped me so much was getting out of the house every single day, as soon as I felt up to it. We would go for walks at the park, shopping at Target, my mom’s house, or the library. I found other moms with babies and we’d get together for mimosas and brunch at someone’s house once a week. I’d wear the baby in a carrier and go on a short hike. I’d go to Starbucks and sit and enjoy a cup of coffee. Getting out of the house kept me sane. Some people freak out and say not to bring baby out in public for 2 months, but that didn’t seem feasible to me. We went out at day 5 and pretty much every day since. In the beginning, we just avoided crowded places or times (for example, we’d skip Target on the weekend, but we’d go on a Wednesday morning with a cover over his car seat). Getting out of the house helped me so much in the beginning."
