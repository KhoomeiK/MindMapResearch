I know that it was commonly used as a description of many native peoples from the early 1900s to maybe 1930s/40s (amusement parks had displays of native peoples like they were zoo animals). How long past that time it was a common phrase used by highly educated whites I can't say for sure (I should really be grading). I can't imagine that a bunch of anthropologists and sociologists sat around and were cool using the same language as Coney Island though, but at the same time the term was used widely in Western novels and even early tv and movies (so it still had popular usage if not scientific usage).

They were horrible to me and still would be if I gave them room to be. They called my degree ""garbage man school."" They made burger flipping gestures at me. I was repeatedly told I was wasting my intellect, and then they all just started mansplaining everything they could to me and even trying to tell me why I was wrong about the things I was studying and proposing in my eventual thesis and dissertation.

Engineering culture is like this, and it's something that is broken about the world today. Valuing STEM above all else is probably not something you can fix in your brother. Since he's family you can't just tell him to fuck off, but over time he will see that you can be successful too.

Here's the thing: I got my bachelor's a few months after 9/11 and I finished my Master's just a few years before the housing bubble burst. There was a recession. Nearly all my engineering friends got laid off. They didn't think it was very funny when I had a job, they didn't, and I made burger flipping gestures at the rudest one of all of them. 

His hatred of what you are doing comes from a place of fear, most likely, and also some entitlement and bullshit he's been fed about what degrees are worth. However, if there's one thing I've learned through national tragedies and recessions it's this: nobody can really predict what's going to get you a job because when the world changes and bad shit happens layoffs can happen in fields that we never would have predicted being damaged just a few years before. Right now I'm pretty terrified my University might close. Twenty years ago when I made the choices I made to start school that wasn't on my radar or anybody else's. 

It's hard to deal with now, but give it a few years and he might shut up. We are going to need just as many people in the social sciences and humanities to get us out of our current mess as we will scientists and doctors (because socially we're a disaster of a world it turns out), but we might not need so many engineers. ;)"

If they are adjuncts and it is a continual problem we may not ask them back (it depends on a number of other factors. For one, we'll ask them why. Some courses do not allow for grade changes or incompletes without permission all the way up to the Dean, so sometimes grades will be held a day or two to allow a student who has cancer or a documented death in the family to get things in. Sometimes people are just lazy. We have to know.) If they are tenured, the whole department can be punished, though what that means varies. We have had a Dean that keep department funding back until all grades are turned in, or will remove some department funding based upon how late grades were, but usually that means that multiple teachers were late."

It got me absolutely tortured in school, and because I knew they cared a lot more about my hair and how ""beautiful"" it was than they seemingly cared about me (since I would be punished severely whenever kids did anything to it--and they tried every single goddamn day), I had to just sort of go along with it and be miserable. I got it cut all the hell off the day I turned 18. My mom is STILL angry at me for cutting and dying my hair. I WISH somebody had seen it for the abuse it was. All my teachers just were like ""oh she wants her hair this way.""

AskMen,fpsck47,t1_fpqlxxy,1588871180.0,"Being stuck in a car and unable to get to a bathroom is my nightmare, so I hear you.
I have a xanax script that I take during attacks now, but I did not when the IBS went away the first time. However, I have actual panic attacks during IBS attacks (can't move, feel like I'm having a heart attack, not helpful in getting to a bathroom panic attacks). A lot of doctors are pretty leery of handing out xanax too. 
Anyway, things like sauerkraut, naked juice (the green one is lovely... but terrible), and such also make me fart up a storm but kombucha is safe. The Trilogy and Cranberry flavor ones are best for me. 
The immodium turned out to be a real problem. I was always on it so was always at some stage of being constipated even though my crazy body was still pooping a little. I feel like it caused some attacks to be worse because there was just more to poop if that makes any sense. I'll still take it if I'm out if I'm having an attack, but I'm not taking it just to leave the house (if that makes any sense)."

Anyway, what I know now that I didn't know then is that probiotics are more helpful than a lot of things. I try to avoid immodium unless I am out of the house. Kombucha is a great friend. Those little ""gut shots"" that they sell at Target and Trader Joe's (different brands) are also fantastic. I had a big flare earlier this year but it only lasted about three months instead of a year and a half, which I would call progress. 

There are some restaurants (Applebee's) that will always set me off and I just have to avoid them. I can't even drink water there. If I have to go to one of these for a friend's party or something I just drink bottled beer. No glass. 

I also have just learned what sets it off. Don't feed me in the morning. Better still, don't get me up early (I will fart till everyone around me wants to die). I love vegetables but have to avoid a lot of them if I don't want to gas or poop myself to death. Food journals in general didn't help, but paying attention did, if that makes any sense. I didn't need to break anything down by ingredients, it turned out I was more reactive to the way some businesses wash their dishes (or what they wash them in) than I am specific ingredients."
