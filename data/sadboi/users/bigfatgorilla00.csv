I think the first step that you should take is stop the black and white thinking. There are no such thing as bad foods. Food is food. Some are just more nutritional then others but that‚Äôs pretty much it. 

I had a BED myself and what really helped me is the book ‚ÄúOvercoming Binge Eating‚Äù by dr. Christopher G Fairburn and ‚ÄúPotatoes not Prozac‚Äù by Kathleen Desmaisons. 

The book overcoming binge eating is one that my therapist uses in her practice. Its a book that explains everything about binge eating disorders and it really helps you to understand your thoughts better. With all the information it gives it contains a 5 or 6 (can‚Äôt remember) step plan that will make you stop binge eating.
The steps are to start journaling, write down how the time you eat, what you eat, how you feel eating it and where you are eating it. This allows you to see patterns as in why you are binge eating and what triggers you to do it. You will start to notice that some foods, places, thoughts or events trigger a binge. 
The other step in the book is eating every 2 hours, i know its hard to be eating that much out of no where but it will really help to go your false hunger go away.  Later in the book they will teach you how to stop being afraid of gaining weight, why you‚Äôre not gaining weight during this process and how to stop looking at yourself in such negative ways and how to stop ‚Äúbody checking‚Äù and they will teach you how to start adding in you ‚Äúfear‚Äù foods again. And last but not least, ones you learned how to feel an upcoming binge, you can start doing other things to replace your binge so the thoughts will go away, such as calling a friend, working out, watch a movie, pick up any activity that you LIKE doing instead of binging. 

Its a bit much to explain but I would defenitly recommend it! Potatoes and Prozac is more a about why your body CAN be addictive to sugar. I think if your considering doing this plan it‚Äôs best to cut out sugar for a while. When I stopped adding in sugar + eating regularly the bingeing stopped immedenitly. With ‚Äúno sugar‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean it in a restrictive way. For me sugar was just a big trigger and I‚Äôd rather have lets say a pizza or some chips in my eating.

With that said, I would also recommend you to go to a therapist so they can help you with your journaling, reflecting and with this plan in general. Eating disorders are hard to overcome by yourself. I told this myself for 4 months until at some point I just gave up, I couldn‚Äôt do it. Now I‚Äôm at a therapist and I‚Äôve made huge steps! I started with being diagnosed with anorexia, with later lead me on to having a binge eating disorder (some would call it extreme hunger), and now its safe to say that I‚Äôm no where near where I was! I still struggle with the black and white thinking sometimes but i barely binge anymore and I‚Äôm happy with what I eat.

If you have any questions or just wanna talk, you‚Äôre not alone and you can always message me if you like :) 

Goodluck! I‚Äôm 100% sure you will overcome this üíû"
EatingDisorders,foxwcib,t3_ga4cyc,1588158516.0,"This is a huge mistake that lots of people have about having an eating disorder! Most people with eating disorders have an average weight. It doesn‚Äôt always have to be psychical. I think just having ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù about food could be just as bad if not worse! Eating is something you have to keep doing all day everyday, and if you feel guilty after eating food that must be tiring and exhausting for you, that‚Äôs not healthy!

If you feel bad or guilty after eating food it‚Äôs safe to say that your relationship with food isn‚Äôt the best. Its good that you notice that there‚Äôs something not right about your relationship with food, that‚Äôs a huge step in the right direction. If I were you I would defenitly get help from a therapist if you feel comfortable with doing that. 
Having an eating disorder is not easy, and it can be quite hard to get rid of these thoughts by yourself. 

Please don‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt deserve help‚Äù because you have don‚Äôt fit in the boxes of having a typical eating disorder. Eating disorders are one of the most perplex disorders out there and its safe to say that most people that have one don‚Äôt fit in the boxes. 

I can also promise you that you will get rid of these thoughts, sometimes it feels like this is forever but I promise you they will go away :) i‚Äôm struggeling with an ED myself and within 3 months I‚Äôve made huge steps! If you wanna talk about or have any questions it feel free to message me üíû"
relationship_advice,foxvi4u,t1_foxvd8t,1588157701.0,"Calling/ FaceTiming for the first time will always be awkward the first view seconds. But I think ones you do it the conversation will go naturally. But yeah, I think in that sense you‚Äôre right. Its easier to do something together like fortnite during calling because then atleast you have something to talk about. Don‚Äôt worry though, you‚Äôre in a relationship so you and her will make it work :) just enjoy each other‚Äôs company even though it‚Äôs just your voices"
relationship_advice,foxv9dw,t1_foxv4i9,1588157461.0,In that case defenitly start with calling! Make sure she is comfortable and maybe if you notice she likes calling with you (which I‚Äôm sure she will!) move to FaceTime to make it a bit more personal
relationship_advice,foxurzd,t3_ga72gf,1588156994.0,"Maybe try do activities during FaceTime? Draw each other through FaceTime, Do an online pub quiz together through the phone, Bake the same recipe through FaceTime and eat it together to see if you taste any differences. There‚Äôs also an app called houseparty that allows you to play games together. Netflix party is also a good option to watch movies together

What you also can do is maybe send them letters? Tell her how your day was and ask her to send one back?

These are all sorts of activities you can do to keep your relationship fun and will allow you to get to know each other better, try to maybe do them ones a week so it will stay special and you won‚Äôt run out of ideas
