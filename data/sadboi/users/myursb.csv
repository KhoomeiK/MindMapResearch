Nothing brings me joy, I can't even write about my thoughts without annoying myself. I overthink everything so much it's exhausting just to get up in the morning. I can't leave the house or socialize which is how I normally distract myself. All of these thoughts keep circling around my head and yelling at me. I'm just so tired and I'm panicking"

I think it's too loud, isn't the right sensation, you don't see anything happen other than being slightly red, plus when that really good band breaks it's honestly heartbreaking. Plus (as strange as it sounds) it's not practical"

BPDlovedones,ff6zd9h,t3_cowcmt,1579638008.0,"I understand this but it's such a hurtful stereotype. I feel like sociopaths, pwBPD, and schizophrenic people have some of the worst stigmas around them. You might argue that  they're all crazy or manipulative and only care about themselves, but that's not a reasonable argument. It's like saying every person in a wheelchair is just trying to get people to feel sorry for them or act like they have it worse than they actually do. There's no proof to back it up and there never will be. You may have had a bad experience with someone with BPD, but that doesn't make them all bad, much like saying all men are bad after one sour experience. It's not fair"
