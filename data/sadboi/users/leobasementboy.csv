relationships,fposdfq,t3_geoj17,1588789838.0,"That sucks, man. I’m sorry you feel lied to and betrayed. Trust is a very important part of a relationship and transparency is a part of trust. I understand that being told after 2.5 years is probably shocking. It changed the very foundation your relationship was laid on. 

However, you definitely need to step back and think about her motivations and feelings. This reads like a cheesy teen dream rom-com, which isn’t a bad thing. In my opinion, it’s incredibly romantic that both her and your family brought it upon themselves to make it happen. They believed that you would be so happy with each other that they constructed a parent trap-esque scheme to get you two to hook up, and clearly it worked! 

Don’t get me wrong, it seriously sucks that she lied about her interests to get closer to you. But she may have developed a genuine interest in those things because of her interest to you, or talked about them because she loves seeing you excited and passionate about your interests. I know that’s how I feel when I talk to my boyfriend about things he loves that I’m not that interested in. I know about them because he tells me, and I love to hear him talk and light up when he has the chance to go into detail with someone who’s receptive and engaged. 

It sounds like this woman really loves you, and it sounds like you really love her. I would suggest working through this with her. Relationships take a lot of work, but that’s only because they’re too precious to slack on. 

Have a talk with her. Explain your feelings calmly without any buzzwords like “sham”. Give her a chance to explain how she felt back then, and how she feels now that you’ve reacted this way. Let her know you love her, but you’re not happy about the situation and you need her to be fully transparent with you in the future. 

If you love her, make this a bump in the road instead of a brick wall. Work with her, let her in, and let her work with you."

If a woman can get an abortion and forfeit her responsibility to her child’s life, a man has every right to do the same, for any/all of the same reasons. In fact, if you were a woman, many people would be telling you that you were sexually assaulted or abused on the basis of nonconsensual withdrawal of contraception. Because you were. 

Her neglect to tell you of her change in contraception means the terms on which consent was obtained have been disregarded. Even if you don’t consider it a form of sexual assault, your trust, life, and future have all been put in jeopardy by this woman.
