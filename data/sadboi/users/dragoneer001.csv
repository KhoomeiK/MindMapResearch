But three? Really? Those shells make tier 7 battleships worthless, I can't get close enough to be effective, and if your team's Yamato players are incompetent or go afk, your team is done for. I'd say reduce the max number of yamatos per team to 2, at most. 3 is just too much. Also, platooning in just yamatos has been a definite problem, they just sit at the back, let destroyers spot, and all three of them focus on the same target, being WAY too effective, I watched 5 battleships fall to this tactic in one match, this is ridiculous. I don't see why 1 Yamato was a problem and I didn't mind the 4v4 format, it was somewhat playable. This whole '3 Yamatos' thing is unplayable if you use tier seven battleships or cruisers.

Life has become so hazy, I feel disconnected from myself and the people around me which I truly care deeply for, and with every social interaction, no matter if it's successful or not, I feel like a creep or a douche. All I want to do is help. I just want to help everyone I know and be nice to everyone so they don't have to feel like I do. I wouldn't wish my condition on my worst enemy. I've been beating myself up mentally for years and I don't know why or how to stop. Being smart may seem like a blessing, but trust me, it's not worth it to have a mind that can think about one problem from 6 different angles and create new problems from that, along with the normal problems of everyday life. Being 'the smart kid' is a curse. It's really been a downward spiral for most of my life. Now I've dropped so low and I have no motivation for anything, and despite everyone that is physically around me, I still feel incredibly isolated and lonely, which only amplifies other problems within, and digs into me, slowly but surely. I do have my good streaks, but that's usually followed up by something not so good and not so small, so whenever I think I'm on an upward trend, my hopes are crushed right in front of me. I think I'm capable of normal things, but then I get on to thinking about how useless I am and how little work I do due to my severe lack of motivation, which I then berate myself about, which also, only makes it worse. I don't know what to do. My whole life I've considered myself very mentally strong but that was undone in a few years, so now it's very easy for me to go from having an okay time with some friends at lunch to wasted in my bedroom trying to dissacociate from reality because I don't want to think anymore. Then when I wake up, I start thinking again. _I shouldn't want to not think._ I know it's very unhealthy for my mental health but at this point I don't know where to start, and that's only my mental health, not considering my financial and domestic future, which also plays it's part in my mind. I don't know much about certain rules on Reddit so I have ommitted a few things for sake of privacy, etc. In the past I've tried pressing my own F key, but I failed and had a mental breakdown, and now I'm too much of a wuss to try again and I fear that my mind will be my undoing instead of my hands or the hand of death. So, don't worry, I won't be leaving anytime soon."

Play like a front facing slow cruiser. Also keep your cool in tight situations and you'll make it out successfully, with the Gneisenau and Tirpitz I usually end up with 3+ kills a match"
WoWs_Legends,f1kv9hf,t3_d7d82c,1569541122.0,"I've been driving both the Tirpitz and the Gneisenau, and with both I actually drive straight at my enemy, and this is where things differ between the two ships, but for my explanation, I'll stick with the Gneisenau. I drive straight forward towards my opponent and give chase. Yes, I chase people in a battleship, but for good reason. The Gneisenau has three turrets, two facing forward, one back, so I utilize my forward guns as if they are my only guns, and I let my back gun spin around and whenever it's usable, i'll use it, but for the most part I ignore it. Secondly, when approaching another ship, you have to be able to avoid torpedos, and that's also why I drive straight, it makes the entire ship skinnier, and harder to hit, and easier to weave in-between a spread of torpedos. I chase down destroyers, avoid their torps, and keep firing. Save your battleships torpedos for when you're as close as possible to avoid them missing, but if you need to use them, use them, just don't waste em. Another important aspect of chasing people down, speed, rudder shift time, and secondaries. The high tier German battleships are fast, that means they can catch up to a cruiser and even destroyers if need be, and rudder shift time determines how soon you start turning, so that steering upgrade that you passed up is more important than your propulsion or damage control. Now then, the big thing about German battleships, are the secondary batteries. Each of the battleships has a solid range on their secondaries, but the upgrades are where it counts. I myself will only upgrade secondary range if it is already a high number, like the Gneisenau at 5.5 without any upgrades. The Bismarck base secondary range is 7.5, and with every available upgrade, that can go up 45% of it's original range, meaning that with a buttload of work, commander upgrades mostly, the Bismarck can have it's 25+ secondary guns firing at over 10km, without you even doing anything. That leaves you free to shoot at the important targets and concentrate your main guns damage because you already have that extra secondary damage going. Especially with the tirpitz. No matter how fast your battleship is, it's still slow to turn it's guns, so if a destroyer pops up on the opposite side of your main guns, you have to rely on your secondaries, or move to engage, but the German battleships VI and up have amazing enough secondaries that I can ignore destroyers on the wrong side of me, I can just focus on my Target and avoid the torpedos. One move I like to do to pretty much any ship is to use the appropriate shell (HE for destroyers and weak cruisers, AP for heavy cruisers and other battleships) and take out the engine, for destroyers you'll need to do it twice because they'll fix it with their damage control party consumable, they always do. I come around the backside, all the while still firing and I drop my rack of torps and execute. Very effective."
