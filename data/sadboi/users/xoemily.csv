They ask family history, and if his biological father has something that runs in his family, he needs to be made aware of it. Or at the very least, keep his (essentially adopted) dad from mentioning his own family history when taking him for drs appointments. 

Do you know if your sister cheated on him to have the child? Or did they just happen to get together/get back together around the time the child was conceived?

Because if you stand by, and you ignore the votes, you ignore when someone is getting slurs screamed at them, you ignore seeing someone who's gay pushed around or someone who's trans spit on... you're a bystander and kind of part of the problem.

Anyway, I ended up going to middle school and high school in Tarpon Springs (half an hour from both Clearwater and Oldsmar.) When I first started... I believe it was high school, the school had an ""open house"" so the new students could look around the school, see where things were, meet the teachers, etc. Someone recognised me, and my parents recognised her right away. I was clearly confused, and my mother realised I wasn't putting two-and-two together. She asked if I remembered my friend Lexi from Oldsmar, and after a minute, I did. Like I said, I was very young when I lived there, but we were best friends as toddlers/kids.   
Similar to the other story, we kinda caught up and talked a bit. We *did* try more than me and my childhood crush did to rekindle our friendship, especially since she literally lived walking distance from where I lived, but as expected, you change a lot between 7 and 14, lol.

We were pretty close friends in grade school, and he moved and changed schools our last year.

I'm still best friends with one of my friends from elementary school (we've known each other since 2nd grade and she is my ride or die), and we like to reminisce about people we used to know, and we decided to search for people we used to know on Facebook. I found him on there, shot him a message to see if he remembered me, and he did.   
No, sorry, this isn't a fairy tale romance of ""we reconnected and fell in love."" We talked a little bit, mostly interact by liking each other's posts on IG and Fb now. I did happen to run into him at the mall not long after, which was strange timing and ironic (we grew up... generally? in the same area. We never lived more than an hour from each other, so it's honestly surprising it didn't happen prior.) It was a pleasant conversation, we both recognised each other right away, gave each other hugs, talked a little bit, and went on our separate ways.

You...literally have no reason to tell him? It's not the 50s, it's 2020. You don't need to disclose that your daughter is biracial.

It seems like this was the first you heard about his family's issue with it. 

Blocking him was a good call, you dodged a bullet, discovering this before you got in too deep. He's clearly not willing to stand up to his (racist) family, and based on how he acted, it seems like he may be one as well."
