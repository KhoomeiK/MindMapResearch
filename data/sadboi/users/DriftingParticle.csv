RocketLeagueSchool,fkvl30a,t3_fkrc9a,1584571408.0,Learn a rhythm with the boost. I never run out. You can get into a flow in your rotations where you always pick up boost. Which allows you to be in places golds can’t get to. Golds are constantly running out of boost and screwing up plays because of it. Lots of setups and no execution. It’s mostly chaos with bits of luck and the occasional player who is better and stuck solo queuing making all the shots. Gold 3 is a trap for solo que players who are good enough to be better than their teammates and even opponents but not good enough to completely lead the random team to victory consistently. A lot of time teammates trying too hard with chaos mechanics self sabotage and always project it to their teammates lol being faster was a huge strength that helped me get to plat. And I’ll dog pile onto the collective message. Defense lol

RocketLeagueExchange,fghmju9,t3_ey6ti9,1580788250.0,"I had a guy upselling his item hard core to me for my items, his 1 for my 2. Explaining to me how they’ll be going up soon even tho insider showed stagnant for the passed month..explaining how it’s an easy sell and my items are a hard sell and actually 2-300 under and I should be adding but he’s not gonna ask for it. 

I commit to the trade. 

Two days later he comes back to me not even remembering me (because for some reason on RL trading post people have a hard time reading previous conversation above) and was up selling these items I had just traded him and telling me how the item I had (his old item) was not really worth those two items but he was cutting me a deal. 

This profit trading hustler attitude is so repulsive and gross and above all...exhausting. I don’t understand how they can stay so vigorously engorged in it all. I just want items I think look cool when I’m scoring dank goals lol idgaf about profit trading or stacking up a catalogue of items that are essentially just pieces of code. Tw octane is a piece of code that makes 5 percent of the vehicle white and because of that it’s worth 15 times all other octanes lol it’s silly. I digress though."
RocketLeagueExchange,fgfldfg,t1_fgfaxlg,1580741841.0,For Rocket League. Not fortnite as well. Fortnite makes 300 million a month. Of course it’s not going to make that much. Just the rocket league game alones profit margin.
RocketLeagueExchange,fgfatow,t3_exrqin,1580732710.0,"There’s too much money to be made off of it lol you all SEVERELY underestimate how much Epic cares about their profit margin in this game. If they put the tw oct in the item shop even for just 12 hours they would make more in that 12 hours than all of the last 3 quarters of their fiscal year. So all of the other details of what is and isn’t with the game..they will do it. It will happen at some point in time. There are only so many options the item shop has before it comes to that, the holy grail. End game. Suck it up and deal with it. Idk why you think they give a shit about these things unwritten parameters of the game. The game is about making money and even more so now. Nothing spells cold hard cash like the tw oct and some sweaty teenagers dreaming of it every night. It transcends the boundaries you all seem to think matter here."
RocketLeagueExchange,fgelc7m,t1_fgel7wu,1580702359.0,We’ll see I guess.
RocketLeagueExchange,fgekxfq,t1_fgekort,1580702050.0,"And the octane would be an import. I think it’s obvious they will definitely do it. They don’t care about the trader market. They want everyone to have a chance at coveted items. It’s only a matter of time. Maybe Christmas this year. Who knows. But it’s a ticking clock until it happens. Also it’ll be trade locked obviously. So it’ll be cut in half in price which is a good thing for Xbox because its double steam and ps prices. But either way, they won’t release apex or other bigger items. But the octane is the center of the game gear. It’ll happen for sure."

RocketLeague,ffe6y8q,t1_ffe6eq3,1579838343.0,"Yeah players who’s otherwise never be able to get them on the market will gladly pay 20 for them or spend 15 to use 1100 cr for the tw dominus. But it’s also a discouraging move from our position because they are openly showing they only care about the profit and not about the quality of the game. It’s come so far because of original idea and now it’s turning into a carbon copy following the formula of profitable success. It’s working quickly too. Easily another 100k players have been added to the database in the passed couple months. Which means we can expect this method to increase tenfold becoming less recognizable each quarter as they experiment on how to maximize further. It’s fine up to a certain point but when they start controlling the market like they are now with a majority of items by controlling the blueprint build cost, that directly affects the price. The item value is becoming a combination of blueprint value plus build cost. Luckily not all the items have blueprints yet but that’ll change soon I’m sure."
RocketLeague,ffe4qiz,t1_ffe3jfq,1579836655.0,"I can get on board with most of what you’re saying. No I don’t think they consume a game and it’s rights just to accept a red line profit margin. But I do think the rocket pass alone or even the old formula of purchasing keys for crates was creating huge profit margins, enough to generate more than the initial investment. What they are doing now seems to be manipulation of the market and it’s users to an almost fraudulent degree. In my opinion anyways."
RocketLeague,ffe1dc8,t1_ffdvnd3,1579834170.0,You don’t think they are making plenty of money off of the game itself and rocket pass?? Also epic makes approximately 300 million a month from fortnite. They definitely don’t need all these extra purchases.

RocketLeague,ff9ystz,t1_ff9y43h,1579724414.0,This is why reddit is such a great place of open minded thoughtful individuals where you can come and have civil conversation and open discussion with rational people.

He picks one that says rookie striker. Opens it. It’s insanely hard shots that even I have trouble with. It’s not rookie. He turned my attention to it by saying “dad I suck I can’t even do this rookie pack”. So I it’s like a small troll. Upon looking into them further, there are tons of them like that and it’s silly for kids or newbs trying to get better. In their minds it sets an unachievable standard.
