I feel happy, I think everything is going to be ok again,  I decorate for the holidays (haven't for years) then BOOM dr. says 'you seem a little larger than life'..... fuck... is this mania.... can't I just be happy or must it always be suspect... how much money is this going to cost me.... where's the next stalker I'm going to fuck... how long will the depression last after this episode and do I have a little time to set things up for my inevitable failure???"

ShitRedditSays,evl7ssf,t3_cjzqlj,1564591384.0,"Older lady here... there is an element of truth to what this young man is saying. However, we are savvy at this age and like nice young men who could benefit from mutual sexual gratification and yes even a little personal validation. Which is a nice side effect if any kind of mutually satisfying relationship. We do not interpret our sexual desires as 'desperate' as most men of ANY age are dtf (espically if it's with older ladies or chubby girls in high school. Many men feel less threatened by a demographic they perceive as subpar). Incels like op do not qualify to reap the benefits of fuhreakay!!!"
