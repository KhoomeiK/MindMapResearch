This is just like  “3G or 4G” they have a specific controlled spectrum on which they operate. The ability for us to tap into additional, what USED to be undesirable wavelengths not because of concern for safety, but because it wasn’t financially viable. With our evolving miniaturization of technology and increasing capabilities of data processing companies can turn a profit on this technology right now. 

If you go outside right now and just stand there, you’re subjecting yourself to the same EM spectrum irregardless if there is a “5G” receiver attached to the telephone pole above you. I suggest looking into the electromagnetic spectrum, just check out the wiki article, it’s not super complex science. 

Tldr; the term “5G” is referring to a specific set of frequencies in the EM spectrum that already exist. These wavelengths are just like anything else that emits wavelengths, we see things in the “visible light spectrum” because that’s the wavelength how our eyes evolved to perceive.

Psychosis,fot906g,t3_g9g1lu,1588047462.0,"Understanding that the love you have for your partner and yourself is real. Chemical reaction driven by thoughts and emotions when you don’t take your meds can cause instability in all areas on ones life, especially on what “is and isn’t real”

I’ve been there many times before, so has my mom (undiagnosed) and so have many of the people I know diagnosed with Bipolar or psychotic episodes ect. 

When you are at your sweet spot, that well rested, stuck to your meds, not using rec drugs or alcohol (if that disrupts your ability to center yourself) I challenge you to write your emotions, written them down- don’t make complete sentences, just tap into that primal emotional experience. Everything you write is valid- from the darkest to the lightest and most pure thing. Accept them for what they are, emotions, in which we have no true control over. 

Our emotions are on a biological level fluid, and when you suddenly hit that state of emotionless limbo remember your feelings- even if you can’t tap into them right there, know you’re in love, realize you’re scared of losing or pushing your loved ones away. 

If you’re uncomfortable with saving that paper destroy it and scatter it across an empty parking lot at 2 am. I kept one in my wallet that I wrote mid psychotic break induced by giving in to smoking down a huge multi-strain joint with a stranger at a party where I wasn’t emotionally stable- 

“Never forget this feeling.” 

Keep all of those feelings in your mind, process them as you see them and remember them, and in your own time try to find a way to tell your partner if you’re comfortable with doing so how your *experiencing* of emotions will sometimes just stop- like a short circuit. Is the whole system there and the groundwork and dedication and love still there? Absolutely. A short circuit just needs to be reset and for you to return to a state of balance and emotionally fluid state. 

TLDR; emotions flow, sometimes they short circuit but the love you feel is real. The fear of guilt is the inability to vocalize this to your partner and requires inner work, make sure you’re comfortable explaining it to yourself before you explain it to them.

Psychosis,fo53t8b,t3_g5na8h,1587516900.0,"I’ve had very similar experiences in my past making that leap into a sudden spiritual awakening through discovery whilst in psychosis. When you meditate and you listen to your inner self, when you’re finding that peace, and when those tiny moments of distraction and physical sense of materially being dissolved, what is actually there? what is felt in the absence of sensory input? these entities, be them angels or guardians, do you feel their presence, do you feel their energy flowing around you, is it coming from within you? 

To be honest I’ve started having a rocky rediscovery of my own; we will always ask for signs until we no longer need them- that is your sign; for your extra-ordinary  thoughts, in those moments do you exclusively take things objectively, do you consciously parallel them figuratively?  

An example, the book you were given, this love story that was written, did you write yourself into it? Did you project your thoughts, intentions and feelings; using the book to decode those inner thoughts and feelings? Did it act as a medium for you to create a greater understanding of what relationship you had that you might not have been able to ever put into words? 

Those realizations during psychosis or abstract as they all tend to hold seeds of truth self proselytizing is one of those, to be honest it’s kind a common, but my hypothesis follows: 

If we truly look inside ourselves and recognize that we are what creates reality around us, that everything in existence exists to us because we observe it- are we not all gods? 


You cannot conceptualize an idea unless you are in the same state of consciousness as to which that thought was conceived; therefore when trying to translate an Epiphany or greater understanding that transcends language, some people would call that crazy, other people will have a similar understanding of to yours in their own way. Both of which acknowledge the abstract supersedes the categorizable nature of existence.

I thought it could have been something of a pineal gland firing but I have yet to explore deeper. I had an inner calling of intuition saying something to the extent of “come and See” but my own response was “I am not ready I must practice and learn.” This energetic presence/ field felt like it was beaming energy into my third eye; this was after I recently did my first cleansing, or banishing of a dark entity a sort of “sea urchin-like” negative energy nexus. I believe my progress is coming to fruition in many ways but this experience was transcendental. Synchronicities keep occurring between friends of attuned minds and it’s an incredible feeling. I will absolutely try this third eye quartz cleaning technique, I have a good feeling about it.

I’ve since then switched rooms with my brother who lived upstairs; upon discovery, there is a high powered repeater for cell connection and WiFi extension in that exact corner above my old room below, there was a lot of negative energy collecting here and the kicker is it is positioned next to a full room sliding mirror; I’ve journeyed deep into the mirror dimension when on my first shrooms trip, I’ll have to dive in again once I train in order to cleanse that plane too.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqSdmNNwW4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJqSdmNNwW4) 

Alternative to NSAIDs, you can use cold compacts, hot baths with Epsom salt, and topical anti-inflammatory such as Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel 1%. I have used this for my spine conditions and deep muscle spasms and has done wonders for me ever since. Because it is a topical gel/cream it has a reduced systemic effect and nearly zero toxicological impact as well. This is the optimal choice in my opinion as the inflammation that would be seen elsewhere in the body would not be directly effected, and allowed to run its course.

The more time and effort, concerned and constructive effort that is, put into changing yourself and your perspective is far far more rewarding than riding that manic high, skating on the edge of stability and chaos, that ever shrinking window of escape from your own undoing. Please, talk to your psych about your meds, get other opinions and try to create a list of what exactly is different. You might realize just how many subtle, unconscious changes are happening and how much stability and healing you’re undergoing. 💜"

As a forum and a community we have helped each other, everyone collectively spreading awareness, not ignorance or social shaming. This is surreal, to see people going about their daily lives- I’m here in north LA and people just couldn’t give less of a fuck. 

Support each and everyone who takes this seriously, who understands the depth  of the world wide consequences. I want nothing more than to bring my loved ones into the light, but time and time again they mock and shame those who show any concern. 

TLDR; support the prepared, we’ll be the ones who can make a difference, an informed one. ✊🏻"

Virology,fklsg6m,t1_fklnwfm,1584313583.0,"There is actually a very small, but significant amount of viral dna incorporated into our own, when evolutionarily speaking did that come from? That’s a lengthy study. Because bacteria, viruses and other pathogens exist without regard to one another with any collective intelligence they will just reproduce until conditions become unfavorable to do so. They don’t have a collective goal or consciousness and therefore simply survive by infecting and sometimes killing other creatures. 

Viruses actually do best when they dont have visible or lethal effects- have you ever played that game Plague inc? The best strategies tend to be high spread, be it airborne, contact, water or “extreme” temperature resistance, and then lethal mutations once there is a critical infection point. (Madagascar closed its borders) 

Because this is an RNA virus it attacks the cells and then highjacks them into viral production factories- a side effect of which kills the cells due to damage and immune response. The virulence of these strains is due to the high mutagenic nature of rna viruses, making both vaccines hard to create, and targeting of their bodies difficult. This also creates potentially lethal host mutations, be it cardiac arrest, neurological distress ect. 
Viruses are fascinating and actually the focus of my degree pursuits, I’d love to continue this conversation if you’re interested!

*edit* 
Pathogens don’t choose mutations but can transfer genetic material through horizontal gene transfer. The most efficient viral strains will spread the most and therefore through natural selection dominate other, less effective strains"

mentalillness,fka585e,t3_fhasgw,1583992966.0,"As much as I’ve personally experienced and seen; lived with and through, it sounds like you are trying your damned hardest to do what you think is the right thing. You can’t control her actions, she doesn’t have to keep a consistent story because she can talk in circles. You’re asking for help, that’s one of the best actions you can take. A few points to consider or general questions to keep in mind:

1.) If her therapist hasn’t found a way to connect with and start to decode her actions, in itself a “language,” she needs to see a new therapist for plans and specialists in your area, Psychologytoday.com 
is a fantastic resource, and can help you gain a better understanding of different approaches to atypical neuro-characteristics.

^this wordage is just a different way of saying “mental illness,” as I’ve found changing the associated language used to address symptoms can help someone feel less isolated or like an outcast

2.) meds can help but they’re not the solution, there are many types of medications across the spectrum- drugs.com has a free app which you can check medication interactions and keep a chart of what she has/ or is taking for your own peace of mind 

3.) you’re only human, and so is she, nothing is instantaneous and in your situation the pathology of her actions is beyond challenging. 

4.) breathe. Under so much stress and with chronic conflict there might be a muddling of intention, for all parties. How old is she if I may ask? Is it possible to have her focus on centering her mind and body without having to work full time or attend school daily? 

5.) this list has been brought to you by a human who has abnormal neurological thoughts defined as Rapid Cycling Manic- Depressive Disorder <Bipolar> major depressive disorder, ADHD, social anxiety, ect ect. Everyone has a different perspective, you cannot see eye to eye with her without changing your perspective and she can’t see through yours; sometimes asking and finding ways to communicate and interact that are just human, helping her focus on other aspects of her development as a human. 

6.) Ask her to write a list, not under pressure or time constraints, just for her to write things down, get them out of her head. With some much constantly flying around in life, fully of chaos and constant fluxes, if we aren’t synchronized with society we can suddenly depersonalize, fragment, similar to what you described earlier in your post. Different fragments of what she might be visualizing, and defining as people or images of her past self may be representative of a buried, unresolved trauma. I sat on the phone with my friend while he tried to commit, I’ll never forget that night, in many ways I try to even now. 

TLDR; 

You’re doing the best you can- ask her what she needs, and work together to find a healthy way to get there. Mental illness can be the hardest thing for a family to overcome, but you will all overcome it, one day at a time. Stay strong and message me if you want to continue or follow up on anything. I’m writing this at 2:02 am and I’m beyond delirious."
