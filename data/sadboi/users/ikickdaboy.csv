depression,fp0sszl,t3_gaipig,1588216126.0,"The ""dark place"" is scary, and I know, because I've lived in it for as long as I can remember. It's suffocating, and a lot of the times, it makes me wish I didn't exist, or sometimes even makes me feel like I already don't exist, like I'm not a person. It's really really tough during those times, I can barely get out of bed.

But there are also times when somehow, the world seems okay. It's rare, but I am genuinely okay during those moments. Maybe because everything just happened to work out that day, or maybe with the help of prescriptions. At those times, I think about death, and it scares me even more than the dark place. Death means I would stop feeling the way air fills my lungs, smelling fresh coffee in the mornings, hearing my cat purr, or feeling my stomach and cheeks hurt from laughing too hard. When I'm going through a rough patch, I could care less about those things, but I do remember the way that fear sat heavy on my heart.

Having control over whether you die or not feels powerful. To have control over one aspect of your life when you seem powerless to control anything else, it's nice to have that power. But once you're gone, you have no more options. Death is an unknown, but at least while I'm alive, I know I get to choose what to eat for dinner, what music to listen to during my commute, or what scent of fabric softener I want to use on my bed sheets. And maybe it's stupid, but god damn, it would suck if I could never eat a breakfast burrito again. Maybe, you can find that one thing, your breakfast burrito, and cling onto it. I know it's tough, but it's always hard to consider the harshness of death when you're lost, and I don't think you should choose whether to die or not when you are feeling that way. (On top of all the mumbo jumbo of being missed, but I think you've probably heard all that before)"

BoJackHorseman,fid6jtz,t3_f7laca,1582363235.0,"I read an article about the writing process they went through for that episode. They kinda just chose to make Bojack drown after so many fans had pointed out signs that Bojack would die by drowning. 

For a lot of shows when they don't know when they'll be canceled, they just plant seeds so they can use them later. All the drowning symbolism was just anonymous one, since there were also times where they hinted at Bojack dying other ways as well."
BoJackHorseman,fid505e,t3_f7ntnz,1582362546.0,"House M.D. is pretty good. It is a detective doctor show, but the main character House is pretty depressed like Bojack, and he struggles with vicodin addiction, as well as pushing away loved ones and manipulating people. It has very interesting character arcs that will make you feel like you're watching Bojack again. Also, I just realized they wear almost the same outfit. Jeans, a t-shirt, and a sports coat. (Actually, I guess Bojack wears a sweater, huh)

Not exactly in the same genre, but The Good Place was also really good. It's mostly a comedy, but it eventually becomes more serious, talking about the meaning of life and so forth as the series progresses. Will definitely give you an existential crisis. (Bojack and The Good Place both updated their last episodes on the same day, so it was definitely an emotional rollercoaster)"
BoJackHorseman,fid3cis,t3_f7p9nk,1582361825.0,"The point of having that episode is to show Bojack how scary death actually is. He's put himself in harm's way multiple times, but has never faced the consequences of those actions. We all know death will come to us one day, but don't actually think about what it will be like when it eventually does come. Once it's happening to him, he realizes how hard it must have been for everyone else who died in his life. They didn't just become nothing, they were scared in those  last moments before death. Bojack needs to live for that, and live for them, because otherwise, he didn't actually learn anything from it, and it was all meaningless. 

And the point of the poem, is that there is no way to see how simple things are, and how even if it's a struggle, there is a way to make things right. But you don't think about that until it's too late. You can't truly know what it feels like, until it's too late. Bojack gets to come back from it though, and actually change how he is. We've all wanted to just see Bojack be at peace. Well, that death isn't peace, it was terror. Him not dying, and actually figuring his shit out is peace.

Lastly, I read in another post, that having successful suicides of characters or celebrities always raised suicide rates after. It raises it by quite a lot, and I've seen a 30% increase once. And it's no secret that a lot of people who watch the show are also struggling with their issues, and if they had really given Bojack that ending, I don't think it would have helped anyone. It would have just made the series just as unhelpful as 13 Reasons Why."
BoJackHorseman,fi6qjd3,t3_f6pmrd,1582204715.0,"From my own experience, of having friendships with older men, I don't think it's inappropriate at all. In my case, I was pretty mature for my age, so they could see me as their equal, while still understanding the age difference. For Bojack's case, he's emotionally stunted, and they even showed him stooping down to Penny's highschool drama level when talking about her crush. 

I don't think Bojack used Penny as a substitute (up until that last moment), I think he actually thought he was her friend, and that's why he was so relaxed about suggesting going to the dance with her. 

I've also been in a situation where I was flirting with an older man, only 34, but it was still a huge gap between 34 and 18. At the time, I wanted it, and I thought it made me an adult. It isn't until now, a few years later that I can see how questionable it was that he fed into it. It still makes me feel icky sometimes, but I don't think it would make me as traumatized. I think for Penny, I think the source of the trauma could have come from the fact that she trusted Bojack as an adult but also a friend, and he let her make that decision. 

(I just also want to point out that I don't think Penny could have been traumatized because of his reasons for going to New Mexico, or the stuff that went down with Charlotte, because even in the last season, Charlotte was vague when talking about what happened in front of Penny, because she still hasn't told Penny all the details)

His reasons for going to New Mexico were terrible, and for trying to break up the family even after getting to know them, was also bad. But I also think that if you cannot stand what happened with Penny, that you should also have issues with consent laws. I don't think it's appropriate for some places to have such low ages of consent, and to also not have any laws prohibiting people over a certain age to have sex with people under a certain age."
