Luckily my parents are well off enough that I was able to move back with them, and I'm able to go back to school and stay with them while I recover from leaving my situation with my (abusive) fiance. I still feel like such a burden though, and I worry for the future as I'm 22 with no references. The feeling you're describing is terrible, and I understand.

If I can't say anything else to help you, I want you to know that no matter what you were taught, your lack of a current job doesn't make you worthless. You're struggling with depression and chronic pain, and you're applying for every job you can find, despite the fact that the deck is stacked against our generation in this current economic climate. 

That means you're trying your hardest, and that is the real measure of a man's worth imo. You also seem concerned about how your family would react if you disappeared, which is also admirable, because it's hard to still have a heart of gold when everything feels like it's falling apart.

I'm not asking you to make a huge commitment or pretend to love life, but just try giving it a few more years. You have time to see how it all turns out and not much to lose. I know that I'm doing a lot better than two years ago, when I was 20. Not great or completely fixed, but still so much better since starting at the bottom and giving myself room to grow a little.

But this man has a troubling pattern of getting physical with you quickly and disappear without a warning. With 3 suicide attempts under my belt, I REALLY understand the struggle with depression and how hard this is. But at a certain point, you have to ask if you're being used.

You deserve better than to be emotionally available to somebody who doesn't give enough of a shit to not disappear without warning every time you sleep together.
