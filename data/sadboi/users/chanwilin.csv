ArtefactPorn,fqamgji,t1_fqai5wt,1589221561.0,"i can see your point about nationalism and personal interests being involved in matters of history, but this happens all the time, and only those who do not read history can believe in fully impartial versions of what happened in recent or remote pasts.

but i also see that you have packed very diverse examples in the same bag. it is not too scientific to compare a +4000 year old ice-man to early modern artifacts about which creators historians know quite a lot. denying direct cultural bonds between contemporary nigerians and the benin civilisation is, to say the least, inaccurate.

also, i would point out how much the relevance of an institution called, well, the BRITISH museum can do to support certain chauvinistic feelings, such as the cult of nation and the glorious past of the empire. i hope you do not fail to see this.

as i said, i prefer having nigerian researchers and general citizenship having most resources at hand. it saves them money, time, creates meaningful bonds, and ultimately does not exclude the possibility of the british museum, or any other institution in that case, collaborating with the preservation of the artifacts and projects with a significant impact on art and history education. but the dynamics of imperial/colonial museums are essentially paternalistic, i.e. having all the control on resources and their interpretation (“this was not stolen, but exchanged”, etc.)

still, a good beginning would be assuming that nigerians cannot take care of artifacts, let alone being their own or not.

also, i find it revealing that you mentioned the iraq looting of museums, which happened right after a ~very colonial~ invasion…"
ArtefactPorn,fqadbqq,t1_fqa2om6,1589217132.0,"in all fairness, i’d rather have nigerians learning about their own past from an imperfect museum, than preserving these artifacts forever, away from their best possible usefulness. kinda the toy story 2 dilemma.

Acid,fndo1aq,t3_g10s1h,1586874175.0,"when i was fourteen, my parents caught me smoking weed. mom particularly did a huge drama. it was literally my third time trying weed and she swore i was doing it since age 10. if ""you're not taking the bull by the horns, i will"" were her words amidst tears.

i learned the lesson for a few months, then became more cautious. fast forward 15 years later: it's my father's retirement party and my family and i are completely drunk. dad tells us this story when he and mum went to watch akira kurosawa's *rashomon*… in acid. my mother's face reddens from utter embarrassment. i just turned my face to her and told her:

—*you know* what i'm gonna say.  
—this doesn't mean you CAN do drugs, ok?  
—look, i won't tell you what i did in the past, but from now on i think i can share my life with you without shame.

i'm not cynical with her and brag about every trip or toke i do. she still doesn't like me doing drugs, but she knows i am a responsible adult and i can take care of myself.

it is not my intention to compare my personal experience to yours and the pain you have gone through. you have had it much tougher, and the only thing i can say about that is i admire you for your immense strength. my only point about telling you my story is i think you did the right thing by speaking the truth. it might be hard for her to digest, but hopefully one day she will understand that you are a responsible, adult human being, able to take care of yourself in every basic respect.

our parents are what they are and there's not much we can do about their past mistakes and omissions, but just like any other relationship, there should always be space for negotiating future interactions. if there isn't, at least you should be able to set the topic aside and go on with your lives. still, bear in mind you did the right thing by trying to have a relationship that is not based on lies or half-truths.

your freedom is precious and you're using it wisely.

best of vibes to you!"

Acid,fl43r05,t1_fl18mly,1584805230.0,"i definitely thought of taking a small dose again. i considered the idea of spending time with myself, drawing, listening to music. but there's definitely a risk of these memories coming back with the same intensity and then not being able to run since, well, i'd be on acid. i think time and moving are doing a good job already.

as i said below, solving *specific* personal problems was never the intention for taking acid. it gives me a wild beautiful boost of reality during a few hours, after which it makes me feel better in general, so i'll stick to that. if i'm gonna understand or forgive any situation, i'll do it in advance. any realisation that comes afterward must be spontaneous.

i do not have schizophrenia history in my family, but i do suffer from bipolarity with a tendency towards depression. some psychotic episodes now and then in my life, but they're controlled now thanks to a good deal of self-awareness. acid helps me so much with depression and lack of focus and i'm actually considering microdosing.

Acid,fl43afe,t1_fl167n3,1584804925.0,"you're right. senses been so open and fragile during an acid trip, it's easy to saturate the brain. time and moving are already doing their job.

i've been in great acid parties with 12-15 people, but also there was plenty of space to roam around, everyone minding their business. this time it was only a large table with four of us having endless conversations about everything. just a couple of breaks to walk dogs, during which, by the way, we DID relieve tensions and spoke about nicer things. environment matters so much.

no one is to blame, but as you said, acid brings out the true self of people."

in any case, solving specific personal problems was never the intention for taking acid. it gives me a wild beautiful boost of reality during a few hours, after which it makes me feel better in general, so i'll stick to that.

- be ready for a long trip and reserve some time. depends on the person and dose, but you might be high for at least 7 hours. don’t panic, but if you do, you might want to be with a friend that is either experienced in acid or didn’t take anything so they remind you that you’ll be ok.
- consider at least a full morning for the comedown and some hours for resting.
- bright lights can be annoying and may give you a headache. in my experience, dim, warm lights and color screens are ideal. you don’t have to buy anything, just be creative with the materials. i use color scarves, boxes and corners in order to create better lighting conditions.
- a toke or two can significantly improve the experience.
- personal problems, stress and other drugs may have a negative influence on your trip. if this is the case, it’s better to be surrounded by good friends.
- music, visuals, jokes, writing and all things creative are tolly welcome. this is the right moment to remember what you like the most in life. sex can be awesome too.
