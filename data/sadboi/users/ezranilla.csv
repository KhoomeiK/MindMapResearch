Anxietyhelp,fpb9nmw,t3_gcb95k,1588465097.0,"Me too. Turning off the news and unsubscribing from all Coronavirus subreddits have helped a lot. Grocery stores give me anxiety when there's not a pandemic so I go to Aldi because you can be in and out in 20-30 min. I also disinfect all of my groceries and throw away any packaging I can. And I put my clothes I wore to the store straight in my hamper.q

Other than those things, I know I'm doing the best I can. I know cases range from asymptomatic to really bad. I've read that if your initial exposure is small then you are less likely to have severe symptoms. That helped my anxiety as well."

The only important thing with that is you should only put it on at night and you should put sunscreen on those spots during the day.

I'm also a college student and can relate. The only thing that's really consistently helped me is to file my fingernails down to nubs (including the tops). Usually I do that in class to have something to do with my hands. But now I can't because it looks like I'm not paying attention. Unfortunately I have no answers for dealing with the urge to pick."

leaves,fo4mk6h,t3_g17dts,1587507146.0,"I just found this community today and I'm glad I found your post at the top. I've gone back and forth about this for years. I don't live in a legal state, so part of this is I rarely know what I'm getting. 

I've always been able to walk away from it when I run out and come back to it later, so I would like to think I could stop for good if I wanted to. Generally I buy a half, go through it in about two weeks, and then my tolerance is rlly high so I take a break so I'm not just burning money.

My options as I see them are:
- Stop smoking entirely and throw out all my stuff or give it away
- Stop smoking for a while and reassess later
- Continue the current mode of operation
- get a medical card so I know what I'm getting (my state just passed medical and I qualify for it, but it costs $100 for the appointment and I have to request some medical records. Also no dispensaries have open yet)

I relate with 6/17 of your points, but maybe that's enough that I should stop. I know you don't know the answers for me, but yeah. Thanks for this post"
