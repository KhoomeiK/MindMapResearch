onepagerules,f2583rs,t1_f25363c,1569968149.0,Sweet looking forward to it
onepagerules,f252r61,t3_dbvne6,1569964749.0,Are the stl files for these (and the other armies you mentioned) available anywhere? I‚Äôve been out of the hobby for years but I have a 3D printer and have been wanting to print up some armies and play grimdark.
tarotpractice,f0msn22,t3_d5hynz,1568752256.0,What deck is this?
WhiteWolfRPG,eyimij0,t1_eyijo6q,1567104436.0,"I'm thinking or running the Manitou Springs that was mentioned above using WtF because I've seen it in play a little bit and have some idea of how it works. If I do that I'd set Manitou Springs in a vanilla world without any larger setting.

Assuming everyone likes the game and wants to continue the chronicle, would it be difficult to then continue to play with the WtF rule set but bring in all of the factions and threats from WtA?"
WhiteWolfRPG,eyieit9,t1_eyidvn0,1567101360.0,Would it be hard to run Forsaken in the Apocalypse setting?
WhiteWolfRPG,eyidjkt,t1_eyi8f3j,1567100932.0,Manitou Springs sounds just like what I was looking for so thanks. I‚Äôll probably start with that and if everyone enjoys it then keep the chronicle going and look into pulling in the setting from Apocalypse.
WhiteWolfRPG,eyicws9,t1_eyi7gtb,1567100666.0,That clears up a lot of questions I had about the differences so thanks!
roguelikedev,evw3y32,t3_cldxq7,1564854516.0,I‚Äôll throw in a vote for A
