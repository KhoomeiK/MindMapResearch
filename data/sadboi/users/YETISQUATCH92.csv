He didn't abandon you, he fell out of love for whatever personal reasons him and your mom dealt with. He is the reason you you even have the skills/experience necessary to run the business.

You know what changed my mentality? Watching my step dad take his dying breath 6 years ago. Starting your own business isnt a asshole move, but stealing clients that has caused his business to fail is going to fucking haunt you for the rest of your life. You just dont realize it yet! When he dies and you get slapped with feelings of shame and regret, I highly suggest you see a therapist. People change man. Your dads business failed in a big part because of you after everything he did because you are butthurt your parents grew apart and your dad found aomeone else to make him happy?? Wtf??

As for your wife, well some mothers are blind to reality. Thankfully my mother isn't like that and will tell me when I'm being a dickhead without hesitation, but I watched my step brothers (who were the ultimate spoiled little shits) get away with the most unbelievable things because of my step mom. Example: I was caught smoking pot in the outside garage while my dad was on the road working, and step mom decided I wasn't allowed at the fucking house unless he was around. About a year later my step brothers tell me she let them smoke pot in the bedroom whenever they pleased. I'm talking having friends over every night and non stop bong rips, blunts, basically a little trap house. Thankfully they got older and realized how fucked up that was. We can thank the father for being a hardass and raising them the right way. Oh and my father divorced that shady snake of a human being and she lives a sad lonely life. Karma came in clutch and wrote a happy ending to that story. Puts a smile on my face. Lol Anyways, good luck and thanks for being a proper parent!"

Oh so because she is a lesbian and pregnancy won't be a problem its ok? This is a unfortunate situation, but she is a 15 year old, thats sexually attracted to girls. If she allows sleep over its the same as a boy staying with a girl because of her sexual attraction. Wtf is wrong with people? How does a rational mind permit this? Just stick with your decision and I can assure you it won't have a negative impact in the future. When she grows the hell up she will look back and say you were right. People shit on traditional values like thats whats wrong with the world. No, fuck that. Traditional values have been ran off in majority of today's parenting and look around? The world is shit. Most of the only good people left were probably brought up not allowed to have sleep overs with the sex they are attracted to. Will she find a way to? Probably. I know I did my share of sneaking around to get it in, but at least my parents weren't idiots allowing them to come over. Don't look at it as her being a lesbian or not. Thats what the gay community strives for, right? She should be treated like a normal ass kid and that shit don't fly.

ApexLFG,et8n2bp,t3_cae9qi,1562561863.0,"I stopped playing for a few weeks. Just started back a few days ago. My 3rd spot with thebsquads I ran with is basically filled. Anyways, im bronze 1 but I assure you thats only cause I just started back. I'm chill and looking for chill squad mates. Ill play however you want bro and as long as you aren't a douche we should have fun. Lol

depression,et4vrhl,t3_c9qvu7,1562458524.0,"I just found this sub. I have so much to say but its hard to find the words to explain it. This fucking post man. From the moment I read ""what the fuck happend to me"" I felt comfort. Is it fucked up I find comfort? I'm so lost in my head bro. Non stop bullshit that fuels this viscious cycle. These fucking chains that no matter how hard I try, how bad I want to be free but my mind WON'T FUCKING LET ME. I have a beautiful daughter. Amazing mother to my child that feels so fucking bad for me and ""just wishes i could help, it hurts so bad watching you tear yourself apart more and more"". I'm holding her back. I should just be alone but I I'm terrified of losing them. I'm terrified of everything. If it's almost impossible for me to understand why, how the fuck could anyone else? Stay strong people cause no matter how shit it seems, and how hard it is, another day above ground is a blessing."
apexlegends,et30gj7,t1_et1x1ck,1562425938.0,"How did I getting downvoted for basically saying the same thing? I think people misunderstood me. After my cunty , scrub ass, ignorant random squad left the match before I could revive them, I proceed to drop items off the cliff (just like your 92 upvoted comment says) and commit suicide then queue back up. Lol the people down voting must be those salty ass players that can actually be reported/punished now for being trash and leaving early."
apexlegends,et2zll3,t1_et2ydf3,1562425599.0,No it's YETISQUATCH92. Idk man I think I reached a point getting so fed up with randoms that when they (quiet often players with TTV in name) would rage quit and I had a gold item I would throw everything off a cliff then jump and queue back into a new game in hopes to find a team that doesnt quit immediately. Lol

AmItheAsshole,eslhn9q,t1_eskdj4t,1562085848.0,"Yeah that behavior is fucking disgusting. You shouldn't tell a teenage soke heavy shit like that even if they are mature/respectful. Sure as hell don't tell some disrespectful little shits like that anything. I'd be fist fighting those kids if I was the dad. Lol oh and if I was the mom id bitch slap the life out of the Mother In Law for thinking it was time to tell the dead baby comedians anything besides ""grow the fuck up and stop being little shit stains of the world"" ."
AmItheAsshole,eslgqik,t3_c879l2,1562085388.0,"NTA-beat the skin off those kids. Im so sorry your mother in law fucked things up. Its the age your children are. The 17 year olds balls are newly dropped so he is feeling all these emotions and anger about the issue which in his immature mind is ""the end of the world"" . Any grown ass person with a ounce of respect wouldn't be making dead baby jokes or thanking God the other family died. Those kids need put into check real quick. DO NOT BABY THEM, because that will tell them its ok to act like that, that they are right. I would ask your husband, the father, how he thinks you should handle them and suggest a major ass beating/3 month grounding AT LEAST be laid upon them for being so fucking insensitive. I'm so mad your kids are acting like that. Good luck and I hope your pain and stress goes away soon. For you and your husband."

AmItheAsshole,erjsco8,t3_c27c01,1560945163.0,"NTA. I come from rural area myself, grew up on a farm. My dad had a whiskey every night after dinner. I on the other hand am a recovering alcoholic and I'm tellin you and all these other people who actually think you are in the wrong, are crazy as hell. A couple whiskeys on ice aint shit. Unless you're verbally/physically abusing her, or pissing the bed all the time, just keep drinkin your whiskey and I'm sure she will be just fine. You could be a crack head, a dope feign, alot of things. So the ONE thing you have at the end of the day, that isn't causing any harm, is just that, harmless. Try brushing your teeth before bed and I'm almost positive she will let it go."

They either gave me nicknames or just called me white boy. It never bothered me, but if I was in your position I would feel uncomfortable. Why the fuck is it so hard to remember your name? Sounds like you work with some people that just dont care. You should DEFINITELY start saying random names! Lol"
