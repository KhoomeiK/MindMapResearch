I agree with not letting anyone tell you to cut someone out of your life for reasons that may or may not be important to you and that ending relationships of any kind with people because they're not vegan is not necessarily productive. However, if a vegan does decide it's a dealbreaker, it's not because of someone's diet, it's because of having a different moral code.

I think it's an oversimplification because I've heard people be like ""why should diet be so important in a relationship?"" when it actually is a dealbreaker for someone. I've seen people so baffled by why a vegan would not want to be in a relationship with a meat-eater I'm just fed up.

If there is uncertainty about whether or not a creature is sentient, the moral cost of subjecting it to possible pain is higher than the cost of assuming it just might be sentient.

Insects can sometimes be hypervigilant of stimuli that caused them to suffer an injury. It is possible that some insects have a more complex experience than others, but even if merely driven by instinct, they would still be higher up the scale than plants. As such, there's no reason to cause more harm rather than less harm, even if the difference isn't that big compared to other animals.

If you rape/mutilate/harm a brain-dead patient, they don't feel pain either (either if a human's capacity for pain is high, sure), but is it morally justifiable to do so? Unless you have a very, very, very good reason to do it, probably not, because you don't have to. You'd still be viewing them as an object, something for you to take or exploit.
