I was hoping that someone here might be able to tell me why I am able to quietly hear my voyager when I mute the audio from my computer. I was thinking that it could be a wiring issue. Do I need to switch the types of cables I’m running (can try to figure out what they are if that would help)? Attached is a link to the audio interface’s user manual and a diagram of how I’ve wired things. Thanks for any help!

audioengineering,fes1tgq,t3_eo3xua,1579360581.0,"Hello all. I was hoping someone could help me fix some playback issues that I'm having with my focusrite scarlet 18i8. I was getting dropouts that sounded like clipping so I adjusted the buffer size and now there are just slight little pops (think clicking). To problem solve, I have adjusted all power settings to high performance and disabled as many background processes as I was comfortable with.

 I am also running the DPC latency checker and am averaging around 1300 us of latency. I have taken the recommended actions suggested by the program, e.g., disabling devices through device manager, but nothing has helped make the clicking go away. I also have been working through ""Glitch Free"" by Robinson, which has also not helped. I'm running windows 10 on an older system with a 3.4 GHz AMD phantom II X2 511 processor.

 Does anyone have any hot tips for what I can do to try to fix this? Could I just be running on outdated and under-performing hardware? Further, if I choose to record with this issue present, will these clicks make it into the audio, or is this just a playback issue? Any help would be great. Thanks!"

 I also don't think there would be much of a distinction between a fresh grad, and someone who continued taking rigorous course work.  Would it be wrong to assume that it's not necessarily knowledge of course material that employers are seeking, so much as it is just being good at applying yourself to hard problems?
