I was *devastated.* Even just thinking about it now puts a lump in my throat. I had people who were honestly concerned that I would die of heartbreak, because I was so grief-stricken. He was my heart-dog. That dog was by my side for 9+ years, and was a rescue, so we basically saved each other. We spent (literally) almost every moment together, and he helped me get my life back. But near the end, he had been ill for a while, and the day we had to put him down, I was screaming at everyone. I felt I had let him down and like I had killed my best friend, which I guess I technically did. I shouted at my family and boyfriend that none of them cared about him, and since he had gotten a little difficult to take care of in the months prior to me making the decision to put him to sleep, I accused them all of being glad he was gone because now they didn't have to help take care of him anymore.

No words can express how much I regret saying those awful, terrible things to my loved ones, but *especially* since they all loved my service dog as much as I did. They knew how much he meant to me, and he meant a lot to them, too. But they were basically the ""safe"" people, because I think I knew subconsciously that they would see that I was lashing out in my grief, and I'm definitely not someone who blows their top often. Needless to say, I definitely get why OP's friend was so furious in the midst of grieving for not only her close friend/mentor, but a beloved pet she had had for years."

I don't mind kids interacting with him then, and I've definitely had hilarious moments like that. Some days, I might even be in a good mood, and if a kid (or adult) asks politely, I'll take my boy's vest off, while warning them that not every SD handler does this and to please not go around bugging people, but that I'll allow it. I'll let them pet him, then put his vest back on, and he's back being serious. It's nice to explain the transformation to curious people, because they might try to pet him, but he'll deliberately duck away and not take his eyes off me.

I've had to (patiently, because if I wasn't calm, *I* would be seen as the irrational asshole) explain to people that they should not distract my service dog. That includes making kissy-noises at him, as well as cooing, clapping, and barking (?!) in his direction. Half the time, these are grown ass men and women doing this!

I mean, just look at King Arlan's reaction to Baldur's death when he said, ""My son...my precious son..."" while cradling him. Uh...your son was an abusive jackass to not just his brother, but other 'lesser thans.' But I was willing to overlook that slightly, since this *is* his child that we are talking about, and who he just saw murdered. Still, something tells me that the family dynamics were horrible on Aerin's behalf. He said that is exactly why he listened to the Shadow Court's temptations, because of his family, but I don't think he's corrupted permanently. I believe he can be pulled back and atone somehow. Baldur's abuse, and perhaps King Arlan ignoring (or encouraging) it, has now led to all this.

...Or maybe I'm just looking for excuses to save him and he is lost to us 🥺️😭"

It's strange, because many people naturally have a certain bias against black-furred dogs, because their expressions can be hard to read. But in the vet tech community and dog rescue circuits I'm in, we don't (usually) have that problem with other black-furred breeds (like rotties lol). There's just something else about Chows that make them unpredictable. Their bite rate statistics would undoubtedly be *much* higher if they were a more common breed, tbh. They are not for the lighthearted or first-time owners.

My SD sorta fell into my life unexpectedly, so that decision was basically made for me by pure luck, but it was definitely a tie for the breeds! Hell, it's been 2 decades since my family had to put our second rottie down, and my dad *still* talks about that dog lovingly, and how much he wants another rottie haha (only reason he hasn't is because they're into dog rescue, too, and just haven't found the right rottie yet)."

Yes, this is *such* a rottie thing! My family had 2 rotties when we were younger, and we had to constantly reassure people that they weren't growling at them. It's easy to mix up that grumble for a growl, too. Once you know them, you can recognize the difference, but it's definitely intimidating if you don't know them. I used to be a vet tech, and I was always laughing with owners about their rotties being so loud, because that's not something people mention often. Everyone talks about German Shepherds and Huskies being vocal, but not Rottweilers. I swear, my childhood rotties were always complaining about something lol! Is their water too cold? Grumble. Are we not throwing the tennis ball to their satisfaction (aka *all* the way across the yard, instead of a half-hearted toss)? Grumble. Not giving them attention? Grumble. Wanting a piece of ice from the ice-maker? Grumble. Their food being a few minutes late? Grumble! They're some of the most vocal dogs I've ever met.

aww,fpar4n1,t1_fpacbva,1588453971.0,"Your dad is wrong. Every few decades, the public usually likes to pick a dog who is ""mean"" and run with it. Right now, the worst dogs ever to some people are Pitbulls. Before that, it was German Shepherds, and then before that, it was Dobermans, then Rottweilers. It's an unfortunate cycle, because I've never met a mean Rottweiler. Not only have I had all those ""mean"" breeds (Pitbulls, Rottweilers, etc.) before because of my parents always having a soft spot for them, but I used to be a vet tech, and I work in dog rescue now. I've never had a problem with the rotties that came in. Our biggest issue when I was a vet tech and now my fostering is -- as you can predict -- the smaller dogs, like the Chihuahuas lol Many of the rotties we had in our clinic were very well-behaved goofballs, and so were the few that I had throughout my childhood. I've never gone to a breeder, so I can't help you there, but our rescue rotties were total sweethearts.

However, one thing I would caution you on about them is that they are very prone to cancer (the reason one of our rotties was put down in my youth) and hip dysplasia (the reason our second rottie was put down in his old age). It's heartbreaking, because they're such lovely dogs, but it's not uncommon for them to develop either. That isn't to say it's inevitable, though! Keeping them lean, on a good diet, and taking cosequin makes a difference. They *can* live a long, happy life. One of my friend's retired service dog is a rottie, and she's still alive and healthy at 13 years old. But I just want to make sure you're aware of the risk. From my personal experience, they're gentle giants for the most part, but can also be headstrong and stubborn. Training is a must, no matter what, because they also tend to stick to their family and be wary of people outside that bubble. The last thing you want is a dog who might get defensive on your behalf. When it's a rottie you know, it's really easy to forget they're big dogs, but other people find that intimidating. Having a very well-trained rottie is the key! :)"

People like to make a lot of assumptions about others' situations and feel entitled to that information and what they have.

It all sounds so ridiculous and like ""ohh, wealthy people problems"" and that shit, but my family is well-off, so technically speaking, my siblings and I don't need to ever work. We all do anyway (or I did before I became disabled. I was a vet tech), because we wanted to, even despite our inheritances.

But the problem is that while I won't say my family name is in ""high circles"" or anything, it's still kind of...really well-known in my area, I guess? But to a lesser degree in the grand scope of the world, or even my country. To drive the point is that my siblings and I were kinda spoiled (and we fully acknowledge that), went to private schools, were allowed to do things without worrying about money, etc. So we lived in *that* kind of upper class world. I don't mention my surname or talk about my more wealthier known family when I go out and about, though, because I've definitely had situations where people just automatically assumed I'll pay for their meals and things like that. Don't get me wrong -- I'm always more than glad to do that anyway without prompting when it comes to dinner with close friends, my boyfriend or his family, etc. but when you have a near-stranger saying, ""Oh, you've got money. You're paying!"" to you, it really teaches you to keep your mouth shut about your finances.

I kinda agree with you -- especially about this probably being a way to strengthen the darkness -- but at the same time, we've seen that the Light isn't all that great, either. Whitetower is a religious city, but if you took the diamond scene with Nia and Imtura, we see how shitty the people there treat outsiders and even each other. Nia even comments sadly on it, and how the Light is so strong here, but its citizens are not. She expressed a lot of doubts about not only her responsibility as a priestess, but what she and the other Light priests and priestesses were supposed to stand for. Previous chapters have shown that her faith is not quite as strong as it was when we first met her, and she no longer sees the Light as the pinnacle point of purity.

I mean...even just the general way the Light works is scary. It literally takes the magic user's life source away and cuts down their life. Nia (I think) mentioned that many spells are just a few seconds or minutes off your life, but as Tyril pointed out, those quickly add up. The Light is a terrifying thing, so I'm not surprised the church is also maybe corrupt, and may have been for a while, potentially even without the Shadow Court's influence (though I wouldn't be surprised if they were the sole instigator)."

childfree,foyfxkz,t1_foxbpmk,1588171810.0,"This was me af with the Try Guys 😩 I *love* all them as well as their wives (or Matt, in Eugene's case), but I can't stand all the talk about Wes. I still watch their videos, but if it includes too much of Wes (i.e. one of the Try Guys babysits him without Ned and Ariel around, the comparison of Ned's life before and after Wes, etc.), I skip it. Basically all Ned talks about is Wes now, and it drives me nuts. I didn't mind it when he was always talking about Ariel, and even found it cute how he's so in love with her...but the Wes rambles just doesn't interest me. I used to be such an avid fan, and now I skip quite a few videos due to this. It doesn't help that their vlog stuff is funny, imo, but Wes is *always* there in Ned's segments (obviously, since they're all quarantining right now). Gahhh. It's really diminished my love for the guys."
childfree,foyfcn3,t1_fox8yai,1588171509.0,"I will never forgive the writers for doing that to Haley. Her character arc was amazing (how they dealt with her insecurity during that one episode where the family went to see that college for Alex legit made me cry, because I identified a lot with Haley there), but it went downhill as soon as Dylan was reintroduced. Just...*why* did they bring him back? It sucks, because of all of Haley's boyfriends, I hated Dylan the fucking most, and I was so glad when they got rid of him. His character is stupid and bumbling in a way that I've never found funny. I don't find his incompetence endearing at all...I reckon they were trying to draw parallels between him and Phil, but it did *not* work. Dylan is nothing like Phil, imo. I'm also not one of those fans who thinks she could only ever fit with Andy; I think they should've gone with anyone *except* Dylan. The pregnancy plotline was the shitty cherry on top of an awful sundae :( Surprisingly, I liked when Gloria's pregnancy plotline happened, and I even almost wanted Cam and Mitch to have adopt another baby sooner. But it simply didn't *fit* with Haley, you know? I suppose I wouldn't have even minded seeing her grow more as a single mum, but them having her basically follow her parents' footsteps exactly, including getting back with Dylan, was very disappointing (and this is coming from someone who likes the Dunphy family the most of all three families. Claire and Phil are my favorite parent pair on the show). They really did ruin her character for me, tbh.

dogs,fow0cks,t1_fov85dy,1588110697.0,"This is what I do with one of my dogs (a rescue, and most of is his teeth were grinded down/some of them removed by his previous owners...), though it does make it easier for them to inhale. Since it creates soup and softens the food considerably, that takes out the chewing equation out entirely, so this may or may not work for OP. One of my other dogs is like OP's, and the water-in-food thing does *not* work for her haha"
dogs,fovt364,t1_fovbe9i,1588107046.0,"Same here...honestly, as strange as it sounds, this is a fear of mine: developing an allergic reaction to dogs lol allergies run in my family, and one of my aunts is even allergic to dogs (mostly hives, and it's not serious, but she definitely gets uncomfortable around them). While I'm not allergic to anything, a lot of people can develop them later, and it can be completely random. Even here in the comments, people mention they were completely fine with dogs almost their whole lives, then suddenly had reactions to them. I love dogs so much, and I wouldn't be able to handle maybe not having at least 3 in my house throughout my life!"

All I know is that I'm definitely not convinced that things are gonna end well for the purification. There's no way it's all gonna be just fine and dandy. It just feels like it's been smooth sailing, relatively speaking, and no big failures yet for the gang to get the shards. Nah. Something is gonna go horribly wrong! I just know it (...and hope for it, cause that means there's definitely a second book haha)."
Choices,fouv6oe,t3_g9k9wy,1588090938.0,"Ohh! This is a very good theory that I hadn't considered. I mean, it's been literally thousands of years since the war ended, and it makes sense that information either gets lost in time or severely twisted. It's like the worst game of telephone, and is exactly what happens in real life: if things aren't recorded perfectly, then history gets twisted. 

So what if, going along with your theory, there *was* some truth to the purification process once upon a time, but it was recorded wrong? I mean, 12 (I think) elves locked away the Shadow Realm, but then they all died. Before they performed their magic, though, they may've left records of information somewhere, and that could've been interpreted wrong? I'm not sure if it would be the case of the shards have to stay apart, or more-so it's possible that the priests (including Nia) were taught the wrong thing on how to purify the shards (or weren't given all the information, and filled in the blanks?), and this is what leads to an infestation of the Shadow Court throughout the world. Inadvertently, I do think MC and the gang could accidentally open the portal (or portals...), and that is what leads us to book 2, as well as the discovery that Kade is being possessed by the Dread Lord ;p I just hope he hasn't been killed like Kaya was..."
