depression,ffpvjio,t3_eu7fur,1580107340.0,"This might sound really weird, but this post helped me. I was browsing this subreddit, wallowing in self pity because I constantly think about how my friends always forget about me unless I'm there to remind them that I exist, and how when it comes to all of my friendships I'm always the one to put in effort. But I read your post, and you said ""I thought of Kris."" And it made me....feel better. My name is Kris and no one has ever told me that they thought of me before. And I know that you definitely weren't thinking of me because we don't know each other but the fact that someone out there that I don't even know might be thinking of me cheered me up a bit. So thank you."

My dad actually died when I was around 6 months old, and from the letters he wrote for me before he killed himself, I would consider him my ""best friend."" My mom got remarried to a man who sexually harasses me along with her, as well as physically abusing me. I don't understand why you're so obsessed with debunking my problems."

ApplyingToCollege,eooubi0,t1_eoou313,1558748062.0,I agree that the amount of outrage seems to be adding to the problem and not helping it. Also the essay does reflect more on the applicant than the SAT adversity score does. CB is shady af for this tho. Also glad to come to a civil agreement.
ApplyingToCollege,eootnts,t1_eoorbal,1558747626.0,"Lmao what are y'all the College Board? I don't owe you any explanation for disliking it, but if you insist.

The SAT isn't a good indicator of college success. Many people who do poorly on the SAT go on to do great in college, and vice versa. Adding an ""adversity score"" will not fix the problem. It just turns people's real life misfortunes into numbers. It turns them into statistics that just simplifies the multilayered problems we face in our everyday lives. We will rely on stereotypes and stigmatize students, assigning them a number not on their experiences, but on data about crime, poverty, and ranking just on where they live. Also the mere fact that the SAT *needs* an adversity score is proof that the test is flawed. 

The adversity score has three main groups: family, neighborhood, and school environment. Family focuses on income, whether or not there is one or two parents in the house, education level of the parents, and whether or not English is a second language. Neighborhood focuses on housing values, and crime, poverty, and vacancy rates. School focuses on free lunch rate, amount of AP courses are available to students, and how frequently students go to colleges they're overqualified for. Of course, some of these won't exactly explain why a student did well or not on the SAT. Say for instance, a student living in a two person household could still face hardship if one or more parents were abusive, or addicted to drugs/alcohol.
