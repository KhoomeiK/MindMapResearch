EatingDisorders,fo7njza,t3_g5ym0c,1587581382.0,"I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I have similar issues, but here's the thing: I live with my long-term partner. At first, living together was enough to halt the urges to binge, but as I grew more comfortable with him, the bingeing gradually returned. So, I think you're on the right track knowing that living with him would ""fix"" it, but ""not really."" (You nailed it, there). What has helped for me is to **eat more** throughout the day so I'm not underfed in the evening  (sometimes that alone is enough) and then, if I do find myself eating or wanting to eat more, I have to be really curious about why I want to eat - I'm usually trying to avoid feeling something (tired, bored, lonely, insecure, self-critical, etc). The biggest, most helpful first step is to forgive. I have to forgive myself for those urges and for the times I slip. It's counterintuitive, but that's the only thing that stops me. Be gentle to you <3"
yoga,fnstppz,t3_g2pkgi,1587228611.0,"I think the consensus is not to beat the elephant in the room to death, then? It helps to hear that from so many people because I think there's this urge to talk about it until it feels like it makes sense or something profound can be gleaned, and it feels like we are just nowhere near that place yet. Plus, while yoga is about connecting, arguably to a larger consciousness, it's also vital to connect to ourselves and maybe that internal connection is the one that needs fortifying right now. I appreciate what you've all shared and will plan my class with this in mind. Thank you for everything."
EatingDisorders,fnmutsu,t1_fnkvpdc,1587078584.0,"Your experience is horrifying. Especially because as you point out, it is not a unique thing. It is not okay for doctors to explain away disease because of race. Ever. And I am ashamed that more people don't know about the institutional racism that continues to cause so much harm. I am so, so sorry for how hard it was for you to get the support you deserved. It takes strength to share everything you did and I feel grateful to have read it...thank you."
EatingDisorders,fnmu7tp,t3_g2c2gp,1587078250.0,"Bless you for caring to ask. Seriously, for having the humility to recognize that your patients' lived experiences are valid and valuable. 

I think the most helpful thing a medical doctor ever told me was: **""This is not your fault.""** A lot of people with eating disorders have shame. Recovery is hard, and there's a very harmful narrative that people need to just want it badly enough and then they will get better. No. This is wrong. Also, please, please, please, please look into **HAES** and weight stigma. My own recovery has been undermined multiple times by doctors not appreciating the necessity of weight gain often PAST a BMI of 18.5 (which is erroneously considered weight restored). 

I think you're going to make an exceptional physician and wish you the best."
wholesomememes,fnbny0o,t3_g0n2th,1586818935.0,"As someone who's struggled with both self-worth and an eating disorder, this is wonderful."
BodyAcceptance,fmxu84f,t1_fmqoyw7,1586471962.0,"I'm so sorry we live in a world that doesn't easily notice your beauty and worth. I think our culture is really messed up that way, and that's 100% the part that we can only control by not buying into it. It doesn't change that other people may continue to see things that way, though. Anyhow, I think another commenter posted about cultivating more positive feelings by focusing on what your body can do. Which is great advice. Your body - no matter what your size/shape/ability/gender/race, etc - the the container that you interact with the world from. That in itself is a goddamn beautiful miracle to me. The more I remember to get in touch with my senses, the more I appreciate this ""meat sack"" (I hate that term, but it does a good job getting my attention) I'm moving around in. My body lets me see and hear and feel and taste and move. 

Another mental exercise that's helped me is to think about all the varieties of trees in the world. We might have a favorite - maybe I love palm trees or something, but I think we could all still admit to the beauty of other trees, I can still see how great a pine is or an oak, etc. We live in a world that's brainwashed us that palm trees are the best and so it takes a lot of inner strength and stamina to look at the other trees and realize they're 100% lovely the way they are. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if any of this helps, but I am thinking of you and I hope you get to feel some ease around this. You deserve to feel worthy exactly as you are."
BodyAcceptance,fmneqit,t3_fw9ep8,1586224390.0,"It sounds like this is really frustrating and I want to just start by saying you're not alone. It might be that specifying a specific body type (in your case what you describe as rectangular) is sending you down a rabbit hole about ""fixing"" or changing your body. I think for anyone struggling with body acceptance there's two pieces to address. The first is how you're relating to your body. And the second is how the world relates to your body. You can't control the second (which is a damn shame because our culture is fucked up and many people never question the problematic beauty ideals). But you can work on the first. Acceptance, by definition basically, is independent of your shape or size. I would keep looking for help, but unless you're just sharing your experience and story, abstain from qualifying your shape. Focus instead on the feelings you are having (more than why) and the feelings you'd like to cultivate about your body. For example, in my case it's discomfort and insecurity and shame. And I'd like to cultivate comfort, worthiness, inner peace. So I try to put energy into doing things that promote those feelings I'm after. You deserve to feel at peace in your own skin and to live a full life without this body image stuff taking up so much energy."
EatingDisorders,fmmsg7w,t3_fvo5ug,1586211197.0,"I don't have advice, I am so sorry! But I wanted to drop a line to say I'm kind of going through something similar. Except I am 34. I've tried many times and been in pseudo recoveries that always led to relapses. My only wish is that I had done it sooner. I don't think it gets easier or that there's any hack, honestly. I also think there's been many studies on over-shooting set-point weight in the recovery process. I am trying to keep in mind that this is normal and temporary. I have a friend who had to take life-saving medication for a while that caused her to gain weight. Eventually, she was healthy enough to stop taking the medication and she returned to her previous weight, but there was no way to skip that stage of healing and save her life. I try to use that as an analogy to what I'm going through. Maybe I can't get to healthy without going through this phase. I'm sending you lots of love and courage and hoping you have a pair of comfy sweatpants or leggings!"
BodyAcceptance,feo7n3h,t3_eo1bk6,1579296271.0,"If you feel comfortable being as candid as possible, I'd ask her out for a walk or something. Tell her you don't want to make her uncomfortable, but that the focus on your diet and body has made you uncomfortable. Tell her what else you'd like to talk about - your family, the weather, politics (LOL), whatever. My MIL is/was similar, but after a few times repeating how hard those comments are for me, she seems to have moved on. She meant well. And, you're spot on the comments almost always come from their own insecurities. Good luck!"
selfhelp,fbjx37g,t1_fb2j75o,1576941416.0,"I've been thinking about this comment for a few days now, trying to assess its value. And, sorry, no. Perhaps you meant well. But unless OP stated that they needed support to make the decision to end their life, I'm not sure how your comment is in any way helpful or appropriate. I DO agree that suicide is a valid option - as any option someone may choose is valid. I've entertained the option and made a couple very half-assed attempts myself. But the original post came nowhere near to exhausting all other avenues worth trying. And it's been posted in a group called self-help, which makes me feel like the role of us commenting is to encourage the poster to seek support and help from whatever means available. I have a few friends who are terminally ill and one who is severely, intermittently psychotic or depressed or dealing with side effects of the only medications that keep them from being psychotic, depressed, or anxious to the point they'll tear themselves apart. For these people, life is so painful that it is almost always hell. I would understand and feel compassion for their choice to end their lives, but these examples have chosen to remain alive for now. They have cats they love, artwork that brings them comfort, penpals they've found online, music they enjoy, favorite foods...I'm not at all saying I know everyone's experience - certainly not, how could I? - but unless someone says they need your blessing to take their life, I think it's safer to ask questions and offer support for sticking around."
NaturalBeauty,fbbnbf6,t3_echrrg,1576703992.0,I've had similar issues. I had to skip shaving for a bit and take a couple days off. But since then I've been using this and I LOVE it. I found it randomly at Grocery Outlet of all places. [https://www.stinkbugorganics.com/](https://www.stinkbugorganics.com/)
bulimia,fbbjg3n,t3_ececeu,1576701720.0,This is HUGE. I've been up and down in my own recovery process (right now...down). And I feel like moments like this strung together are the path. Cheers to your rational mind and I hope class is a great distraction.
selfhelp,fbb914q,t3_eb1c5y,1576695571.0,"I have tons of student debt and no degree either. I'm sorry. I know it's a stressor and it does indeed feel like a trap. Sometimes I fantasize about faking my death and secretly moving to an island where I can live and work off the grid. Very unlikely story, haha. I find a little comfort and purpose in just being kind to people I interact with. It's a challenge with some folks - a lot of us are miserable for so many reasons - but it's good for me to try. It's like a mental or emotional discipline when I am feeling worthless or hurting to at least not make the world any worse. I have not gotten myself out of it. Maybe there is not a bright side and maybe nothing I do - good or not so good matters. But it does help a little to act out this experiment in kindness."
bulimia,fbb2xge,t3_ecbfj5,1576692182.0,I am SO sorry that was his response. Our culture's concept of beauty is effed.
EatingDisorders,fakp3kv,t3_e9md5o,1576170811.0,"If you are thinking about this enough to post your question, I am sure you deserve help. ""Sick enough"" is definitely a disordered concept and invalidating oneself is one of my own disorders favorite ways of tricking me. Eating disorders affect people of all weights and sizes and the fact that we don't always acknowledge the disorder in people in bigger or average sized bodies IS a sign of a cultural disordered relationship to food and fixation on outward appearances (as opposed to relevant symptomology)."
EatingDisorders,fakog77,t1_fajwwer,1576170504.0,"This is accurate. Culturally, we have normalized dieting. But dieting is very much a disordered relationship to food and internal hunger and fullness cues. Like, you wouldn't restrict your bathrooming times or amounts. Food is necessary for an organism's survival. Any attempt to ""manage"" that beyond what is sensible based on time, finances, preferences and availability is arguably unnecessary at best and a dangerous trigger into a full blown eating disorder at worst."
bulimia,fakme8s,t3_e9fidp,1576169544.0,"Thank you for posting. I hope whatever time you have left is as peaceful and comfortable as possible. I see you're wearing a Vonnegut shirt. For some reason, his writing always reminds me to find joy and lightness in spite of everything."
bulimia,fa6qzhj,t3_e7uy19,1575827689.0,"I'm so sorry you're having such a hard time with the behaviors. As scary as it is, going to a hospital might give you a little relief. I've had to be inpatient before myself and it was hard to get there (LOTS of tears) but I did get a little break from feeling crazy and awful. You might also suggest that your dad call either the mental hospital or an eating disorder support number to chat with someone who has more insight into what's going on with you. I'm sending you a huge hug and hopefully a few breaths where you feel a little more ease. <3"
Gastroparesis,f92rp04,t1_f901vei,1575039918.0,YES! My gastroenterologist talks about the middle path. Licorice sounds interesting. I'm taking ginger and tryptophan at bedtime and that is helpful. I sometimes rub an essential oil blend on my tummy and that has anise. In case you're interested:https://www.saje.com/product/gutzy-GUTUS01.html
Gastroparesis,f8zwv26,t1_f8z08w6,1574965736.0,"Good for you. I think sometimes I forget that I am allowed to make my own choices and not be a slave to restricted eating. I hope we can all stress less, because honestly, I can get sicker from stressing myself out than any food I might decide to eat (besides alcohol maybe...)"
BodyAcceptance,f8zw572,t3_e30ei5,1574965465.0,Thanks for this reminder. I'm heading to a huge family gathering and know people will say things that feel stressful to me. I'm planning to use it as a challenge to work on my 'change-the-subject' conversational skills. I'd honestly rather debate the validity of global warming or reproductive rights than diets and body size with any of my right-leaning extended family members. Probably safer to brush up on how this football season is going...but I know literally zero about that.

bulimia,f8zuhk1,t1_f8yt3af,1574964993.0,"That's an easy response, and I \*promise\* you, anyone who has dealt with this disease for more than a few months has had that thought and tried. Multiple times, probably. It's like telling someone who is stressed out not to stress. I'm sorry your nephew is struggling. There are multiple factors that contribute to the development of an eating disorder. Three main ones for myself and many others are: 1) Societal pressures from our culture and sometimes our family (people in smaller bodies are frequently rewarded, while people in larger bodies are shamed), 2) genetics (many people go off and on diets, but for some people, a diet sets off a physiological response that involved nerve and hormonal pathways that lead to severely disordered behaviors), and & 3) trauma (the disordered behaviors around food provide a coping mechanism that protects the sufferer from current or previous traumatic experiences."

EatingDisorders,exogw75,t3_ctuyb4,1566476301.0,"I have been in and out of treatment for over 20 years and because of my personal experience combined with what others in treatment have shared about their eating patterns, I have a different perspective. I think ""true"" binge eating is actually quite rare. I believe it's more accurate to call it ""reactive"" eating. And I suppose that definition about feeling out of control fits with whatever we call it because what is happening is your higher prefrontal cortex decision making has been set aside while your survival instincts kick in and direct you to keep eating. You do not have to be low body weight for this to happen - it's related to complex hormonal pathways. Any time I restrict (calories or my eating window) I will eventually compensate by eating a lot - I can't help it. I also understand the GI drama that can lead to one wanting to limit intake, but because it ultimately leads to reactive eating (which is definitely hard on anyone's digestion), it ends up being a counterproductive action. Your experience with food is valid, as is the suffering you feel. I'm sorry this has become something in your life that needs your attention, but if I can encourage you to let go of restricting your food and eating windows, I really think that's the only path toward real health. I wish someone would have told me this 20 years ago, although I'm not sure I would have listened. Sending you lots of compassion."
