migraine,ezmpzik,t1_ezm0h7r,1567995527.0,What did you do without Topomax? I tried to get off because of the cognitive stuff but the migraines came back so hard I had to go back
Buffalo,exdusyi,t3_cs1osk,1566187398.0,"So glad to hear this! I thought I was being cynical. I think the only reason people like it is because everyone has wanted a children‚Äôs museum for so long and now they have one, so it‚Äôs better than nothing. But they put SO MUCH MONEY into it and could have done so much more. They should never have put it into the hands of the people who had the East Aurora museum, they should‚Äôve started from scratch with more capable leadership. And yes, not a great location. Hate to be negative, but what a huge disappointment. Very poor execution, money that could‚Äôve been so much better spent."
aviation,evpnyka,t1_evltw4b,1564677127.0,Thanks--is it common to cancel that far in advance for a thunderstorm?
aviation,evpnsm2,t1_evlmf1a,1564677042.0,"I guess that's what I'm wondering. I've never heard of an airline cancelling 12-18 hours in advance for thunderstorms. Is that common? (I'm not being obtuse, I'm really asking:)"
aviation,evpmy4n,t1_evlnxi6,1564676608.0,"Now that Southwest has taken the current Max planes in their fleet off the schedule until January, and has to take out the additional 44 planes it had planned to add to the fleet this year, they are still rescheduling."
aviation,evpmudn,t1_evlxpl5,1564676552.0,"Well, they are cancelling and rerouting flights on all planes. They don't just take the flights that were set for the MAX and cancel them, they try to take the flights that affect the fewest people and cancel those--according to Southwest anyway. They haven't just canceled every flight that was scheduled for a MAX. Those were taken out of commission and they're rejiggering everything."
MuscularDystrophy,evpm2kp,t1_evpfcwq,1564676136.0,"Thanks. Do you ever get that ""restless legs"" feeling, where you just can't keep your legs still?"
