it's always muslim men too, it's like they expect the women of their shitty faith to be submissive and motherly and care about the world and shit like that when i just want to be treated like everyone else. i never smile in public and try to look as unapproachable as possible, but this stupid costume i'm forced to wear ruins the facade. 

it's fucking bullshit and i wish i could run away but i'm not even 18, have no money and nowhere to go and don't even know where to start.
