TwoXADHD,fn3hkvx,t3_fz6d3u,1586620887.0,"Hi there, just found this sub and your post so I thought I‚Äôd chime in.  Absolutely talk to your doctor about your concerns; they are knowledgeable about common side effects and should take your history into account as well.  I have comorbid diagnoses of ADHD and bipolar II (with generalized anxiety sprinkled in for good measure).  I‚Äôve been quite stable on my current medications for about 3 years now.  It took me a couple of years to find help (mental healthcare is a nightmare without insurance).  I started exploring medication options and some of the meds I tried were awful.  

Finding a good provider was life changing.  I got on the first combination of meds that helped more than hurt and I‚Äôve been on the same meds with different providers ever since.  I‚Äôm telling you this to hopefully help you make the decision but also to let you know it may take some trial and error but there is help out there if you need it.  I am on Lexapro, Ritalin, and Seroquel.  Weird combo but it helps me.  

For the longest time I was really only concerned with the bipolar diagnosis.  The anxiety and ADHD seemed less tragic.  The older I get the more I realize those other conditions have contributed just as much to my mental state over the years and learning about all of those aspects has helped me understand myself better.  I hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for and that you‚Äôre coping.  Best of luck. üíó"
