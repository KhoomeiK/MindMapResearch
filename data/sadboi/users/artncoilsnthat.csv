I don’t want to make it seem scary, it’s just that if anything happens or goes wrong it might cause you to panic. 
It’s easy to mis-perceive things on acid too. Like a face might look demonic or a chair might look like a hunched over fiend in your living room.

Because it’s your first time there is just too much unknown that can happen within your mind, and also outside of your mind.
It might be very difficult to regain composure/control if you experience something disturbing.

It’s best that you have an *Experienced* person to trip sit you. 
But i know this isnt always possible. Just make sure the person you do it with is someone you are very comfortable being around. Someone you can trust to not judge you. Someone that will help you if need be.

Tripping alone is fine, it’s just for your first time you’re better off safe than sorry.

Extra tip: try to find something to occupy your time while tripping. 
Like art, music, some type of hobby, dancing.. just something. If you sit staring at a wall tripping it can lead to weird or bad places. 
Best of luck, treat the substance with respect and you’ll be just fine :)"

It’s pretty evident that people don’t want these futuristic trampoline shooters. CoD was never meant to be so fast paced. 
This iteration of CoD is great, and to be absolutely frank about it a lot of the arguments i see being made against the game boils down to “i didnt check my corners and died so the game is shit”
You give people a level of complexity to deal with and they can’t handle it. The only map that’s really fucked is euthanasia bridge. 
Otherwise people need to learn how to have a gunfight. The fact that sprinting to ADS matters now is good. The fact that you have to think about where you are moving and such is a big improvement to “i pressed Q and won”

Someone has to say it, some of you bring it on yourselves. 
You can only be told how to do the mechanic so many times before you get kicked.
