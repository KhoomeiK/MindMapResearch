He just wants to give people equal opportunities that raise the standard of living. My main point is that it‚Äôs stupid to recognize that there is a problem, point the root of the problem at the White House, but steer clear of any ill comments to the current administration and opt into blaming a possible future one."

Even the professor whom I assist is not sure how they‚Äôre handling payment for TA‚Äôs. I did however find a website today called ‚ÄúUberTesting‚Äù that made me a little more at ease. Essentially you browse a webpage while following commands and thinking out loud and you can make about $30 an hour ($10 for a 20 min recording/survey) I highly recommend checking it out, it‚Äôs not a lot, but it takes my mind off of things temporarily and I‚Äôm making a little money."

exchristian,ez4hcs2,t3_czu362,1567686883.0,"I am in the same boat as you on the family side of things. I‚Äôm coming off of 20 years in the church and it‚Äôs honestly been a very smooth transition for me. My mom would threaten disownment if she found out, and probably turn my brother away from me (he‚Äôs the only remaining one of my siblings who‚Äôs religious, and he‚Äôs currently attending school to become a pastor). I have 2 sisters who also have lost belief. 2 of us are in college, so we‚Äôre waiting to tell our until we don‚Äôt need her financial records for FAFSA. She has threatened to not give us that info before because of things we did that went against her christianity. I‚Äôve found it best to not tell the truth, but not really lie. If she still thinks we believe, she doesn‚Äôt really have any incentive to ask us if we do specifically, so just staying relatively quiet about the topic works well. And anytime there‚Äôs a religious discussion in my house, I try to just listen and not talk. They think I‚Äôm trying to learn more, I stay out of the spotlight. Obviously this won‚Äôt work well for everyone, and I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt give much advice on the church side of things. Maybe instead of going to a physical church, watch sermons online that teach in similar ways to your current church? That way your saved from any embarrassing excommunication and you‚Äôre still getting to see a sermon. And you could always see if your pastor will keep in touch to meet occasionally and talk with you outside of the church. I‚Äôm really sorry about your situation."
exchristian,eywmck8,t1_eyweijm,1567532798.0,"I love this! It‚Äôs a very interesting way to look at the world. Me and my girlfriend are constantly talking about how life and what we do within it simply doesn‚Äôt matter, but we have these social constructs that constantly tell us otherwise. It‚Äôs a long bridge to cross, but that realization can eventually provide so much peace of mind in the long run."
exchristian,eywlv0j,t1_eywl0j6,1567532473.0,"Thank you for the disclaimer! If I‚Äôm being completely honest, it‚Äôs a way for me to feel security about what happens after death, and a way for me to feel purpose in the world. I have no fact or evidence to support that, and my beliefs could be completely different even a week from now. And differing beliefs/disagreements about my opinions are completely okay! Disagreements start discussions and that is SO important especially in theistic beliefs. I just don‚Äôt believe in the widely held christian perception of god. How can a church preach acceptance and rely on a book that promotes love above all else, while simultaneously attacking minority groups and removing individuals in those groups from the congregation? Obviously not all churches do this, but I grew up in multiple southern Baptist churches and they were all so toxic looking back on it. My belief based on that experience simply comes down to the fact that I like the idea of something being out there, not much else haha."
exchristian,eywl0u0,t1_eywczty,1567531914.0,"This is awesome, thank you! I definitely think that it‚Äôs great to just be the best person you can be, without hindering other‚Äôs perception of that which in my experience is the biggest issue with christianity. It‚Äôs basically a group of people with a superiority complex based on morality because of an opinion in theistic belief. It makes no sense. Everyone has their own morals, and just because you believe everything in an ancient, contradictory book doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre better."
insaneparents,ewnuk3g,t1_ewnu60o,1565591318.0,"Not trying to blame it on Christianity at all, I‚Äôm just saying a lot of the time Christians feel superior to others because of what they believe, and they don‚Äôt respect others who don‚Äôt.
