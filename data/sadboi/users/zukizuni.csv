Also I've been drawing since before kindergarten so I win (maniacal laugh), but to your credit, I've been drawing circles and squares at that time and writing probably takes a better-developed brain... like that of a 4 yr-old (XD).

Also I tried lucid dreaming like 5 years ago, but I ended up having like inception dreams, where I dreamed of myself recognizing a dream is a dream. It was kind of scary, especially considering the content that's usually in my dreams. I felt like I could never truly wake up. So I stopped trying it and after a couple of months I started to have single layer bad dreams again (:P)

Again, thanks though : )"

I get the meaning is usually not that but it kind of has the connotation of ""you are gifted with something special at birth which others weren't."" I've never met anyone who spends more time drawing than I do, and I think my being comfortable with drawing is a product of that, not talent (if we're talking genes no one in my family does any form of art)."

I've done creative work my whole life (though every time I say ""my whole life"" to my grandma in a conversation she's like UR WHOLE LIFE HAHHAHA), and I agree with Steve Toltz: (paraphrased) they take something integral away from you in exchange so you become unable to feel content/happy. In short, I'm not a fan of bringing things out in my head either (:, P).

Note: the ""aoligei"" part is an internet slang. It originated from Kuai Shou (I guess it's like TikTok? I'm not sure) and its root was another internet slang ""gei li"" (给力) meaning something along the lines of awesome, brilliant.

Even if Emika wasn't lying about the not being in ichi-gun(一軍) part, if she does those not-reserved things, even if they might be a phase, she has the yearning to be more outward, unlike Tupas, so she's not completely innocent. Maybe because I've grown up in east Asia, so culture makes me agree with what the panel is saying the whole time (esp YAMACHAN!!) and I do think she's leading Tupas on. But not the sleeping with Ryo part, that's just a fun conspiracy theory which I don't think is meant to be taken seriously."
terracehouse,fgerfmi,t3_evp7tt,1580707420.0,"As a fine arts student, I don't think either Peppe or Kaori had extraordinary technical skills (but I love them both). You can tell they both aren't the type of people who have loved to draw, and drawn a lot since kindergarten (which many people in my art program are, including myself), or the type of people who went through a rigorous art program and taken life drawing lessons. and I think this is part of the art school problem Kaori is insecure about. However, although his lines aren't yet very confident, Peppe's drawings look like someone who can observe well and has a good idea of how things should look like. Especially, the colored pages in his manga, which he probably spent longer on than his content pages, were very nice.

So I don't think either of their drawings are very special.

With that said, Peppe's manga's content is fascinating, and Kaori's subjects are interesting. For example, I loved the drawing in her exhibition with the dog in a bag. What Kaori said about Peppe might just be out of her own insecurity and she clearly looks up to him. I do too. The convenient store scene made me cry. I love Kaori for her sensibility and I admire her for her accomplishments before her illustration career. Kaori also has a great sense of fashion imo."
