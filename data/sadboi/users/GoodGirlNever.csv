Divorce,fmfzjve,t1_fmfy6qh,1586038142.0,"It's hard to let go of something that you once wanted, worked hard to earn, and still value in some way. So hard. So so so hard. Write down why you are resigned to leaving... and reread it when you start feeling that confusion again. 

Plan for the weak moments, the triggers... the things that get in your head and skew reality. 

Hope is always a wonderful thing...until it hurts you over and over. 

You have one life. One.

Divorce,fmfv3mv,t1_fmfdo9k,1586035465.0,Exactly this! This is what I was thinking and then I saw you write it out- better than I could have. I am kind of excited to run for the hills.
Divorce,fmfuppl,t1_fmcdg6u,1586035239.0,"Aw, it sounds like you have moved onto bigger and better. I am really happy for you for that. You describe the world I would like to find myself in. The place I rented is right by the grocery store and restaurants as well!! 

I am nervous to date. My budget is going to be very very tight... so I think I need to find a part time job to make a little extra. 

Yesterday morning I was convinved that I needed to stay because I am a couple hundred dollars a month short of being comfortable and 'not to tight' on budget. I cried all damn morning. 

Today, I realized that I would rather work -on top of my 40 hour a week job-doing something- anything- for grocery money than I would rather stay. Essentially, I would be putting the price of my happiness at 200 a month and when I though of it in economic terms that is ridiculous. 

So I have enough... just no extra with my regular job. Getting a part time job can help with finances and get me out meeting people!

I am thinking hardware stores like Lowe's or Home Depot... because: Men. lol"
Divorce,fmfu6rx,t1_fmc22y9,1586034924.0,"Hello. Wow, you do have an awful lot going on as well. I understand how it feels to find someone that is not meant to be yours. That is difficult... but I think they are placed in your path to teach you about yourself, your situation... let you see that the thing you want is out there. It can be found with another. Hard to picture when someone rocks your world, but it's true. 

Staying for the kids is truly wrong. It messes their heads up with what a real loving and rewarding relationship should feel like... and the last thing you want is for your kids to grow up and live your marriage. 

That being said, finances and hunger are real problems as well... we all have our priorities and choices. Sometimes we stay to make sure the kids can eat and get to school. The basics...

My youngest just turned 18... she confirmed that staying for them was no way for things to be. Luckily it wasn't until the last couple years that hings started to feel rocky. 

Kids are smart. They know whats up... they can feel tension just like you can. Maybe even more.

I hope the best for you and your situation. I understand that things are never simple... never easy. Life is complicated- and the black and white thinkers are just not seeing the reality around them."

I needed to read that. Thank you!"
Divorce,fmb3llo,t1_fma9a8s,1585917392.0,"That is what I have done. My youngest turned 18 a couple months ago and is about th graduate. I have thought of leaving multiple times over the years.... and that ramped up as the kids got older. I always decided to stay in order to maintain the school they were in and our very middle class income with 2 adults working. 

I read somewhere that one way to know that it is a good thing for you to leave is to start looking for apartments. If it makes you feel nervous and wrong... then maybe wait. If you are excited and see it as possibility and future and growth then you need to do it. 

When I started looking at place it made me excited. I still imagine myself in this new place:  Watering my plants and cooking in the tiny kitchen with weird paint colors and hardly any cabinets, but brand new appliances... (and wishing I had the big kitchen of this house lol!)

Three years isn't very long when you have already put in a lot of time. But now, for me, three weeks to getting my keys seems SO LONG! Weird how that works..."
Divorce,fmb2gds,t1_fma5nvz,1585916449.0,"I suppose the thing I mean is that together we dont make a lot.... and separately we will both struggle. Having 2 incomes is always better in that case. 

We bought the (small) house because I thought we shared the same goal of using it as an investment and fixing it up and eventually selling for profit. He never wanted that as it turns out... long story. 

It ends up that I was the main one pushing for the house that we have. So leaving him with that big bill....

But you are right!! If he wants it then he will pay. If not, then he will sell or lose. That is not on me. I know I don't want the house though. I can't carry the responsibility alone or on my lone income. Plus, I want to live in the city where the restaurants, bars, and fun stuff is. This place is nothing like that.

So maybe I am actually more worried about me making it on my own. Low self-esteem has become a factor since the 20-year deadbedroom went 100% dead a couple of years ago. That really affected me. And now I wonder if I will ever be able to be good enough for anything. My budget will be extremely tight. I am afraid that I am going to fail myself. One thing he has always been is dependable on getting the bills paid. Having that was really important when my kids were little. They are older now. I guess I am afraid I am going to let myself down.

Thank you for listening to my ramble. My worry on finances seems to be a general life theme. Writing you made me see that perhaps I am more worried about my own finances and am projecting that onto him as if I 'owe' him something... who knows!"
Divorce,fmb1ryq,t1_fma5jp1,1585915861.0,"I didn't like the tone of the article all that much either. The moral obligation- I would feel that because I do care about him still. Part of me will always love him. I have spent my entire adult life with him and he is the father of my kids. 

I am sorry to hear that your husband was useless during your illness. Having an affair while being useless means he was selfish. Somewhat similar for me... not a physical illness, but I have spent the last year and a half dealing with extreme depression (treated and medicated- still breakthrough depression). 

Over the years it was always me that pulled him in daily. I would push myself to be positive and engage him. Always initiate intimacy, always making sure to have him weigh in on things. 10 years of his binge drinking, 2 years of AA meetings, multiple fights. I pushed through. He has been sober 15 years now, but still remains naturally withdrawn and quiet. And then a year and a half ago I could barely stay alive let alone mentally support him too. I realized that I had been catering to him. I thought it was my job to make him feel special and cared for and that he would do that for me.

So when my depression escalated and became resistant to medication I needed him to step it up and pull me up... hold me up, want to make me smile, go out of his way for me in some way. 

Instead, he pulled into himself and I got an attitude - basically for not paying attention to him anymore. 

Truly, I set the precedent a long time ago that I would basically cater to him. Obviously that worked well for him. He cannot reciprocate that and I feel ignored, neglected, etc.... add a 20 year deadbedroom into the mix and resentment becoes the Name of the Game.

Sorry I keep going on and on. Honestly, you saying he left you hanging during your hardship is basically what I have been thinking as well. 

Glad you got out. Your own four walls and freedom to (eventually) meet someone one day has to be relieving."
Divorce,fmb0xq2,t1_fma4fcr,1585915108.0,"Thank you for your words. You are right... there is never a good time to do it. Never. And with everything feeling so unsettled around us, it feels even more wrong because he is a safe bet... like living with Dad. An extra set of hands, two incomes making things easier- by far, in this world.

He would rather I want to stay.... but I cannot ever find what I am looking for if I stay with him. A genuine and romantic relationship. The deadbedroom thing has been going on for years and years. It has done a number on my self esteem and belief in myself. I am really trying to pull myself out of that, so I am trying to be very aware of the pandemic giving me an excuse to chicken out.

Like you said, there is never a good time. I needed to be reminded of that."

Divorce,fkzmbfn,t1_fkyi375,1584674416.0,">It's time to petition to modify your support order(s). Being a martyr does not make you a good father, it makes you a broke as fuck single dude who barely sees his kids. Nannies, daycare and preschool are perfectly normal and perfectly fine and mom needs to get a full-time job after 3 years...

Clapping! 

This OP. It is time to change things up. After the world returns back to semi-normal, it is time for you to be in their life more. This requires you to have more available income. Day care and nannies are absolutely fine... and in some ways are actually a good thing as the kids get to have more people to learn things from. Plus, if you were closer, there could be less need for the daycare and nanny anyway as you would have them more often. 

She needs to work. 

These are difficult questions you are asking. I understand her concern, but I think it is overly worrisome. Really, if you wanted to be super safe you could wear the N95 when with them (although I can never breathe well in those things!) That might make her feel better though?

If I were her and the kids were healthy with no underlying issues, then I would let you see them as long as you were healthy! Meaning no fever, sore throat, body aches, cough. Those kids have a right to see you as well. And since it sounds like you have a really good head on your shoulders regarding Covid19 then I side with you on this one. 

Boy- isn't she lucky that she has someone paying for her world so that she doesn't have to choose between work or seeing her kids? hmmm"

Oh wow. I have never thought of this in these words. The concept I have thought of in a thousand and one ways... but the way you worded it is so straight to the point. This is what I have been dealing with in my DB.... (mow divorcing).

and this is what I am dealing with my AP... as recently, my AP and I have gone legit friends since we learned that we cared for each other deeper than an affair allows. Having him as a friend allows me to have his soul in my life without the complications. We are still trying to navigate those seas, but we are getting there. 

A few serious late-night conversations have revealed that we will always look back at the passionate part and want it in some way... but we know that will fade- where friendship is forever. I can't believe that I found such a close friend through this. But in all honesty, we were very broken when we found each other and we have helped each other through quite a bit. 

The fact is that he loves his wife, it was the sex he was after. We are compatible in so many ways... and when he started caring more deeply about me, having sex with me made him feel guilty. When it was just the physical part, he was able to justify his need differently. 

So now we are learning a new way to be. And things will change over time. I know this. But the care that I have for him runs deep. And I love the physical expression of affection, love, lust, care, need. It is hard to not be able to give in to that. And he has said the same. 

Soo, I have gone on and on... but that's because I hadn't put our situation into words yet, so forgive me... but I definitely understand what you had said. And I know that in time, our physical need will subside and it won't be as painful. He will stop lamenting as well. Well, lamenting while speaking in gratitude about our friendship. It is such a bizarre and crazy situation... but I am sure it is not something that someone else has been through before. 

Thanks for giving me a place to write this."

Like pulling on a rubber band... that penis is all stretched out now!!!

These are the mindsets that allow all the sales of the bullshit products that claim to enhance penis size. 

Old puritanical perspectives seem to insist on defying science."
adultery,fe5zjc3,t1_fdvxkym,1578878429.0,"Thank you for reading my words. Yes, it is heart wrenching to feel that connection that can never really 'be'.... So unfortunate, but that's the way it is, I guess."
adultery,fe5zfm0,t1_fdwp7l8,1578878363.0,"I know what you mean... things are complicated and once life gets rolling it is very hard to try to restart--- restart AND live comfortably on one income, that is... so divorce is a difficult concept because of lifestyle also!"
adultery,fe5za0g,t1_fdyudza,1578878263.0,No way to stop it! I think it has to run its course... and I hope it doesn't hurt too much in the end. But yes... every single time!
adultery,fe5xwda,t1_fe5xfau,1578877394.0,"I'm sorry.

But those women have done purposeful stretching and distortions to create that effect. Some have even had numbing medications injected to cause the effects. 

Pornhub does not offer an accurate medical depiction of men, women, or even sex.

I have worked closely with gynecologists and assisted many women through many different and complex situations. 

The female anatomy is not worn out by a penis. That is an old wives tale and should be finally laid to rest for the year 2020."
adultery,fe0rsc5,t1_fe06pi4,1578817858.0,This!!!! 🏆
adultery,fe0rqu5,t1_fe08vc7,1578817838.0,"No. A woman's pelvic floor is strengthened by orgasm. Muscle spasms are like ab crunches lol

Sex doesn't wear out our vaginas."

I'm currently seeing an AP who will become TOWGA... and boy is that doing a number on my fvcking heart.

I never protected them from it like I thought.  And that sucks. Buuut.... they are smart and adjusted adults now. Young adults but still...

Your little one will recover!"

adultery,fdzu66t,t1_fdzrylo,1578795873.0,"I'm leaving my SO by the end of the year.
He is not leaving his wife, so it's not like that... but, when I leave, I will need to move on. I don't want to be in this type of relationship anymore. I have learned what I want from a partner and exactly how dysfunctional my 23 year marriage has been. I had no comparison before... and my SO and my values and priorities do not align at all now that the kids are grown up. 

My AP will be a great love story and a soul that I learned from. But he is not mine to keep and I know that."

adultery,fdyzoaa,t3_enas82,1578785236.0,"Love is a strong feeling of connection. It often starts with a friendship. 

Sometimes it happens when you don't plan on it.

I'm not sure what is confusing about that... it's like that in many situations. From platonic friends to FWB."
adultery,fdyyp92,t3_enbgjc,1578784883.0,"Yeah, I'm fvcked too. 

Beautiful and painful.

adultery,fdwfeh5,t1_fdwc9bd,1578758172.0,Thank you so much. I enjoyed writing it. I'm sorry that you can relate... but it's also beautiful to have felt this before too. It's the loss that is heartbreaking.
adultery,fdwf85j,t1_fdwa4g9,1578758118.0,And maybe they feel it a little too. Or maybe that's wishful thinking...
adultery,fdw0w6d,t1_fdvz7uu,1578753881.0,"Aww, Thank you so much. You have no idea what your comment meant to me. 

I love writing. I have no idea how to break into the writing world, though..."
adultery,fdvxbu0,t1_fdvvzzn,1578752780.0,Absolutely terrifying. Thank you for reading!
adultery,fdvww9w,t3_en3ymc,1578752608.0,"You have said a few things in your responses that tell me that you want and already love this baby.

Women get to make these choices because women live with the consequences... either way. There is consequences to aborting and to keeping. Which consequence are you more comfortable with? 

You can send him info to connect with the child once born... as then he has the right to be involved. 

If you choose to abort, that decision should be yours and yours alone."
adultery,fdvvl5o,t1_fdtl0kx,1578752031.0,I like to think that if we feel it then it's likely that they know...

adultery,fdvvh7j,t1_fdvqhwg,1578751973.0,Yes. Both... making it so emotional.
adultery,fdvve99,t1_fdtxojj,1578751931.0,"And that's the problem...

I'm aware of it in the moments, too... making it bittersweet.

This is why I got emotional and want to commit everything to memory. 

It's like falling down a hill... I don't know how to stop."
adultery,fdt9hcm,t1_fdt3ay9,1578713667.0,It's surreal. Amazing.

adultery,fdszl2c,t1_fdszeou,1578709997.0,Yes. That's exactly the conundrum. I need to leave and make a real home...
adultery,fdsxcpg,t1_fdswc4q,1578709164.0,"Exactly! If it was like this at home, I'd have NEVER gone looking for intimacy. 

Definitely a sense of loss when we part... and at 3am when I would love to be held...

I hope that i find this in another soul when I'm single again."
