IWantToLearn,fjth382,t1_fjqv8da,1583607756.0,"This is most helpful for me. Somehow, breathing exercises tend to make me panic even more. So, like another commenter mentioned, ask them what helps (preferably before a panic attack sets in, so you know what best to do if it ever does), cos it’s not a one size fits all situation. 

This 54321 grounding technique helps me immensely; if it helps your friend, you may consider suggesting that they carry some sensory items around with them. I always have water and sweets on me, something to fiddle with, my earphones, and medication in case it gets too intense. Also moving to somewhere with the least potential for sensory overload (basically go to the opposite of bright, loud, and crowded). 

Human touch helps me a lot too. Just being there with a friend and holding their hand is very comforting to me. You’re a lovely friend to try and find out more, and I’m sure your presence is very much appreciated. I know I’m thankful as fuck for the friends who bother to learn how they can help and have learnt to spot me beginning to get an attack from a mile away. It is just the sweetest thing."

loseit,f48tip9,t1_f48rloq,1571448467.0,Thanks for these suggestions and all your advice !! I really appreciate it :’)
loseit,f48pjsd,t1_f470dbx,1571445268.0,"I havn’t heard of that term before but that’s exactly what it is! It’s tough because the nearest gym that I can afford is about an hour away, and I can barely manage balancing work, family, and friends as is. Coupled with the slow progress so far, I’m not very incentivised to go out of my way to work out. What do you think of home workouts, not those as intense as Insanity but perhaps just those no-equipment 30min workout tutorials they have on youtube?"
loseit,f48ouvd,t1_f46u7dx,1571444709.0,Wow thanks for all this! Will have to read up more but I’m pretty sure I’m under-estimating too. Guess I’ll have to buy a food scale and really be aware of my portion sizes. Thank you again.
loseit,f46lgyl,t1_f46kb47,1571410359.0,"Aw thank you for that suggestion :’) I’m trying to slowly be kinder and more accepting of myself, both inwardly and outwardly. It’s slow progress but progress nonetheless. I’ll definitely try to grab a copy of that book! Thank you again kind stranger."

loseit,f46jota,t1_f46hkr0,1571409674.0,"Yeah I’m in the acceptable range but I lean slightly towards being overweight. My self-esteem is pretty low and constantly being called chubby by everyone (family, friends, boyfriends, colleagues, even literal strangers) always made me feel pretty shitty, though I’m sure no one meant it maliciously. 

Man that’s some slow weight loss hahaha I guess I’m pretty much on track then! Hm I never thought of talking to a doctor about it. Maybe I’ll try that! Thank you for your advice :)"
loseit,f46hmlj,t1_f46gh5m,1571408919.0,"I try to stick to 900-1,200 cals a day. That’s true! Well, some people have told me we all have a so-called “default” weight and this is just mine, and that I won’t be able to lose much weight unless I really diet and exercise like mad—which I’m not aiming for as I know it’s not something I can sustain. But I don’t know if that’s really true, if my “default” weight when I was younger was much lighter. Or maybe that’s just ‘cos I was young heh."
loseit,f46glnh,t1_f46dfiv,1571408530.0,"Yeah I track using with My Fitness Pal and usually don’t exceed 1,200 cals. I used to take in about 3,500 on the daily, which felt ridiculous once I realised it. You’re right though, maybe I’m just not estimating my portions correctly. Do you have any suggestions on how to weigh/portion food while eating out? I have a problem with having to *always* finish whatever‘s on my plate, whether due to upbringing or greed haha, it gets tough to stop myself when I’m eating out and receive larger portions."
loseit,f46fi6b,t1_f46ddv1,1571408107.0,"I’m about 4’11. I’ve been using my My Fitness Pal, and I’ve started logging my food in Ate as well to try and identity trends in how I eat. 

Yea I guess I should look on the bright side. I made most of my lifestyle changes to be healthier rather than just to lose weight (though that’s of course also one of my main reasons) and I guess I do feel slightly less unhealthy nowadays."

schizophrenia,f1zzsi6,t3_dba864,1569852991.0,"I totally feel you. There was a lot of dissonance between how others viewed me and how I still felt and saw myself. 

It used to make me feel so lonely and misunderstood. Like if I was doing relatively better and appeared more stable than i did, then I was no longer having it bad in my head. And did that mean I was making it up, if no one could see how much shit I was still going through?

I realised that it’s okay even if I didn’t feel entirely stable, even if I don’t think I’d ever know what stability truly feels like, even if my stability was defined for me by others. I just had to make sure I knew what I felt about myself and I validated my own struggles without letting them weigh me down. 

Take it one baby step at a time. You’re doing great."
blunderyears,f1vhh55,t1_f1vfnwb,1569770947.0,Excellent versatility
Anxiety,f1f4i5t,t1_f1ezrgc,1569436823.0,"Agree 100%. Learning and drilling into myself some CBT skills and positive coping mechanisms was the toughest part. It’s not easy to inculcate by any stretch, but it’s helped tremendously. Now I can leave my room, take public transport, interact with others... I never dreamt I’d be able to do these things in the past. 

One app I can recommend is Daylio. You can track your daily moods by specific activities and that has helped me narrow down what affects me negatively. I also use Habit and Grid Diary to keep track of my days.

Anxiety can become manageable. It may not seem this way now, and certainly did not when I read this kind of advice and “motivational” posts, but eventually it gets better. I used a mixture of therapy, medication, and mindfulness (and other skills) to help me get back on track. 

I wish you all the best in your journey! Sending internet hugs :’)"

DecidingToBeBetter,f0xszu7,t1_f0wb4it,1569045371.0,"I’ve always been quite sickly and was told not to exert myself so I was never physically fit. After time grew to believe I was really weak; even walking up a flight of stairs would leave me panting. So one aspect of it is that I’m not used to the feeling of exercising and pushing myself. 

Another aspect is that I really dislike the way I look and have an anxiety disorder. So the combination of being around so many people and being uncertain of what I should do triggers panic attacks. Fortunately, I have friends who gym often who are willing to train me, which helps a lot but doesn’t totally remove the discomfort and anxiety I feel."
DecidingToBeBetter,f0w7ecm,t1_f0w6vij,1569000710.0,Thank you for your support :’) It’s gonna be tough but I’m really determined to push through no matter how uncomfortable it may get.
BPD,f0uhj6j,t1_f0ubmy3,1568940931.0,"Thank you for your words. Unfortuately, the main reason all my long-term relationships ended was because they either cheated on me or had addiction problems. I tried to make these relationships work even after, but my moods and emotions got too intense for them to handle. I’m still trying to work through the trust and abandonment issues all of that exacerbated, but I guess it’s hard when you don’t think you deserve love and truly believe you’ll never be enough."
BPD,f0ucxd0,t1_f0tze46,1568938046.0,"I feel you. But for me, the shitty feeling comes before and I usually talk to them because I feel yucky about how I was in the relationship and feel the need to apologise. Somehow they always make me feel a little better after I talk to them. I guess that’s why I keep doing it, but I want to be able to stop because I don’t want to continue being a burden like this."
BPD,f0uavvk,t1_f0sn10b,1568937103.0,"With a lot of love in their own way, whether it’s being affectionate, validating, or trying to make me laugh, they’re all pretty supportive."
BPD,f0u8l97,t1_f0sno4e,1568935993.0,"I’m much closer to some than others. A few I had more toxic relationships with are not exactly friends I hang out with, but they do receive the annual birthday text from me lol. 

No matter why we break up, I always end up feeling like it was my fault; if they cheated on me, it‘s ‘cos I simultaneously wasn’t enough and was too much to deal with. So the initial post-breakup conversations usually have me apologising and trying to make it right with whoever I feel I fucked over, making up for the girlfriend I was by being a better friend."
singapore,f0iived,t1_f0icgpy,1568642396.0,"Just to add on to the above suggestion, keep in mind that thinner condoms have a greater tendency of snapping. Typically when I’m looking for something thinner, I choose Okamoto over Durex as it’s failed me less in the past. Otherwise, Durex Extra Safe or Pleasuremax is a good bet. Also take into consideration that different condoms have slightly different sizes (like Pleasuremax is larger than Close Fit iirc) which affect how comfy it is. I’d suggest just trying out a couple and picking your fave! I mean... your friend’s fave.."
singapore,f04tpn7,t3_d39x1j,1568395398.0,"I was really affected by the death of someone I love very much. So it was something of a blessing that I had already been seeing a therapist for mental health issues, and spoke with him about some of my emotions which he then helped me to work through. Unfortunately, most of my family members who were just as or even more shaken than me never sought any kind of professional help, and half a decade later still havn’t fully processed their grief (in my opinion). 

I think a lot of it has to do with cultural norms. I’m generalising here but in my experience, most people from Asian upbringings still don’t speak very freely about emotions. Pain is seen as something all of us deal with, and it’s more of just sucking it up and soldiering on like everyone else. Additionally, I feel like seeking professional help is still viewed by most in Singapore as something only “siao people” do. And pretty universally, death and grief are also taboo/touchy topics that many refrain from discussing. 

But I do think we’re starting to see more acceptance and interest in having open conversations about such topics, so I’m remaining hopeful."
singapore,f04q709,t3_d3aau3,1568393144.0,"Honestly I wouldn’t stress myself out too much. When I travel in and out of SG, I usually have an assortment of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, mood stabilisers, and a lot of benzos with me—have always been most worried about getting in trouble for the zo’s as I typically bring a lot ’cos I may have multiple panic attacks a day. 

I only have a digital copy of my doctor’s note, and I’ve never been stopped or questioned despite my huge bag of pills in plain sight. (Then again I just never really thought too much about it so maybe that’s my bad.) Though it’s always better to be safe and apply for permits and such, if you can’t get approval in time I’d say don’t worry too much about it especially if stress exacerbates any negative symptoms you have. 

Hope you have a good time here!"
Parkinsons,eyz4kki,t1_eyx7h39,1567609408.0,"Your mom should be friends with mine! They seem so similar that if you didn’t mention the part about cooking, I’d think you were my sister writing this haha. I think half the reason my mom doesn’t want to try out a support group is the age thing as well. 

And I’ve started to exercise once a week with her (not a lot but it’s a start) by telling her that I want to lose weight and I need her help. That’s going pretty alright so I think you’re right about making it feel like I’m inviting her rather than telling her to do something on her own. I’m gonna start trying to do that with some other activities and hope it works!

Yeah it can get pretty rough, especially ‘cos I’m not a particularly patient person so I really have to be aware of the way I respond and act. I just keep reminding myself that however upset I get, she must be feeling it tenfold and I need to understand that it’s incredibly hard for her. 

Thank you for your words, and I wish you and your mom all the best ♡ Keep fighting the good fight"
Parkinsons,eyz2mqb,t1_eywutzv,1567608109.0,"That’s great advice, I’ll definitely try that out. I think she’s unable to see that she would be giving 193693x more than I do if the tables were turned. 

I’ve searched for support groups in the past but didn’t put that much effort into it ‘cos I don’t think she’d want to go. I also don’t want to force her into anything. But yeah maybe I should physically visit some of the existing branches of support just to find out more. They’d probably have a better idea of what I could do, I’m sure my mom isn’t the only one who’s rejected the idea of help. 

Thank you for taking the time to help out a stranger. I appreciate it so much."
Parkinsons,eyz1whz,t1_eywhooa,1567607617.0,"Before medication even comes into the picture, I think one of the biggest hurdles will be for my mom to accept help regarding her mental health. That’ll be a challenge.

I think her current PD medication has also been giving her many negative side effects like brain fog and feeling dissociated. Unfortunately, she says her doctor doesn’t address these concerns with her—but she refuses to let me go along during medical visits to speak with her doctor as I‘ve gotten quite feisty with my own medical practictioners in the past if they don’t seem to be listening (oops).

Anyway, your friend made me smile so hard :) She’s so adorable and I’m glad the both of you have each other."
Parkinsons,eyz0xnj,t1_eywdzez,1567606948.0,"Thank you for such a thoughtful response. I think it’s a mixture of all the points you brought up. I kinda knew these things on some level but they were all tangled up it was hard to understand, so you putting them down in a digestable manner really helps. Like I didn’t think of how I may have been exacerbating that feeling of losing control by trying to make decisions for her. I think the biggest problem is moving on in a healthy and productive manner from where she is now. Your words have really helped, and I’ll check that book out when I have the time. I wish you and your mom well ♡"

Met this guy for the first time at a bar and I had been drinking prior so I was already pretty buzzed. After we ordered a jug each, in my happy-drunk state I began to ask him how his day was. He stared me down for a good half minute, and just said, “We don’t have to talk, you know”. O-kaaay. We drank our beers in absolute silence. After I asked for the bill (which he didn’t even offer to split so I ended up paying for), he said, “So my place?” Um."
