with both jaws now recessed i cant see other way to resolve the problem then to push both jaws forward, which were to happen naturally if it wasn't for the bad orthodontics and tongue posture that i had when young. btw im 20 now"

Mewing,fnfzh72,t3_g1fxn2,1586918830.0,"actually no. your posture guides the way your teeth will position themselves, i cant find the pic now but ill try to explain: if u have a posture that your chin is always looking up, you are more likely to develop a overjet; if your neck is like a turtle neck, you will probably have a overbite. actually, u can mew, but if u dont keep teeth slightly together, closed lips at all times, proper swallow, its hard to get good results, because part of those results depend of your good posture. and u may yes be sometimes mewing wrongly and its very important that at those times your posture is at least good."

Mewing,fnal0zw,t1_fnaivx8,1586799330.0,"well we mostly eat processed food, which is extremely bad for our health since it doesnt have any protein, its pure garbage and thats why most people from the us are fat (these type of food dont feed us for long periods of time) and have undefined jaws, cause there is a whole culture about it, for example, fast food. there is too the fact that we mostly chew soft food, preventing us from literally chewing and making our face muscles strong, this impact in mostly two things: we dont have enough force to keep our mouths shut (lack of force), making our faces long with time, also doesnt let us have those amazing defined jaws. thats why people who chew gum everyday tend to have defined and strong jaws, they use their mandible. in resume, we eat soft food with zero proteins, and that makes our whole face 100% relaxed. one fun fact is that latin languages tend to use their tongue way more, in spanish for example all vogals touch the palate, sometimes the language that you speak can help you having a nice tongue posture but unfortunaly there is more involved for forward growth to happen."

from what i know, if your teeth are not straight, you need to expand your palate, this can be done with a hyrax or mewing, hyrax gives teeth a much faster result and mewing not that much, of course. what i recommend is to ask for your dentist a hyrax, to expand your palate, and after removing it, stop going, just mew. btw, if u choose first option make sure if your jaw is retracted, if so, dont go first option. go straight to my recommendation or option 2."

BPD,etp2eve,t3_ccs62a,1563043894.0,"hey, im here. im 18, also have bpd and a bad relationship with my parents, i know what is like.

one the thing that helped me was to start dating and kinda moving to my gf's house. what i mean is, getting apart sometimes helps to see the big picture. u cannot try to help him, he has to help himself, i mean, he has to understand what is happening, why is he feeling this way about you guys. your son can do this. just give him space.

the important thing about space is that basically your making him independent. stop treating him like a kid, if u do, he will think u are stupid or... idk. just let him do he's stuff, dont try to intrude, but also, show him affection, a distant one. i mean, here in my country i have to study to this huge test to pass in a public university, i dont want parents saying that i have to study, but also want to see them wanting the best for me. dont try to patronize him, just show love, a distant one.

always try to understand why is he like that. cause, u know, no one is born with a X personality , your personality is always a reflection about your family. so, try to see in yourself, and your husband, was is triggering him to be this way. u have to change too in order to make him the best of himself.

dont go to him only when hes angry too. what i hated about my parents is that they never wanted to know anything about my life. sometimes, when your kid is in a good mood, try to go talk to him like u want to know about his life in a soft way (?), dont try to initiate conversations, let things go in his flow. and u do this because u love him

to have a better relationship with your son again is

1. giving him space --> not treating like a kid
2. show that u care about him (but not like in big phrases, simples action)
3. seeing your flaws and changing them so he can have a better influence
4. being patient

if u have any problems, please call me on the chat. ill be happy to help because i was once your son. all my love and luck to u, sorry about the giant response."
