cats,fqszc2s,t3_gklmu2,1589624464.0,"I always do this with my cat. Offer her some of what I'm eating to be like ""see, you don't want this"" and now she's seriously adventurous with what she eats and she's kind of started staring at you while you eat, slowly inching closer until she's right up in your face. She ate some of my muesli bar the other day."

cats,fqh3eli,t1_fqh36ox,1589366452.0,"I'd say they probably do have a smaller impact. Maybe it hasn't been labelled as a huge environmental threat over here. Have most cats in America always been kept indoors, or is this something that's happened in the last few decades?"

cats,fqh2rry,t1_fqgyihu,1589365838.0,"In terms of the flightless birds, I live in an area where they would never be. If I'm being honest, my cat used to catch a bird every now and then when she was younger (she's 15 now), but none have ever been native thankfully. It's a fair point you make for sure, but like I said, I guess it's just a culture ingrained in our society over here. Cats just don't seem to be kept inside."

This will be your future, so do what's gonna fascinate you and keep you interested :) It may seem daunting, but I believe in you!"
cats,fnrwx8g,t3_g3l1fa,1587204744.0,"Has he ever done this before? My cat is 15 now, I got her when I was 7. She's always been a little evil lol. She'd attack me ALL the time when I was younger. I always had scratches all over me. Now that she's a bit older she doesn't do it much anymore, but she will still lash out sometimes. She's just feisty. I still love her unconditionally, and I know she loves me too.

I guess this is a bit weird is he's never done it before, but I wouldn't think too much of it for now. Cats will be cats."
