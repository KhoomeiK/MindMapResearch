DBZDokkanBattle,fpcj399,t3_gcipo8,1588502425.0,Unpopular opinion here but I really hope it's a set amount of tickets not a random number as for me personally I have been screwed over way too many times by it particularly the int LR gohan banner back in the day.

kakarot,fo5lgx7,t1_fo3aabw,1587528599.0,"I mean yeah that's true but remember big bang attack is the lost stupidly broken move in the game, I hate to be negative but I kinda wish it was removed it's too strong."

DBZDokkanBattle,fksn1c3,t1_fksmvnh,1584493791.0,I understand she's supposed to be defensive but she also looks like she'd be useful to give addition too as well purely for the attack and defense lowering

DBZDokkanBattle,fjmz744,t3_fe68iz,1583491357.0,"Best advice I can give you mate is to take time out for yourself do little things but don't push yourself too far into it, it's a rough and long path having to go through this kind of stuff (speaking from personal experience), however reflect upon yourself and find a drive to make you want to improve upon the amazing qualities you have hidden away. Go for walks or runs, see an old friend just take time for yourself first. Also you didn't lose your job they lost you I'm sure you were a good worker, but hang in their dude keep pushing yourself. Turanga wae wae and kia kaha."
