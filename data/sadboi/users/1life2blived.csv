BPDrecovery,fqtt668,t3_ggnxjl,1589645618.0,"In the process of recovery there are going to be times that feel ""wrong"" because they aren't something that we've experienced before in a positive way.  Or even it was genuine, real, healthy happiness sometimes people with BPD will label it as a ""bad"" thing because of the drop that can follow the emotional highs and idealizations we experience.  I is possible that what you are experiencing is a co-morbid MI, like Bipolar.  It is also possible that it's a dissonance that comes with change, or a unconscious reminder of something you experienced in the past. 

If you have a therapist it would be something worth mentioning. If not i would recommend being mindful and keeping an eye on it, especially if you do start to experience abnormal lows or find yourself having difficulty coping."

AskWomen,fc2lkx1,t1_fc2cern,1577366089.0,"In both cases it was hypothetical. 

If your child dies then you might want another baby. Thatâ€™s offensive to me not because itâ€™s possible that children die, but to think a dead child could (or even should) be replaced like a worn out t shirt. That is offensive because it is dehumanizing and devaluing that child. 

If you get a new husband he may want to have children with you. That offensive to me not because it is possible that she will devolve and remarry, but because of the weight placed on this hypothetical mans opinion about the mothers life choices. That man may never exist and yet his opinion is more valuable than hers? Thatâ€™s offensive to me because it is dehumanizing and devaluing that mother."

AmItheAsshole,fc1pltk,t3_eflpo2,1577325713.0,"Definitely NTA. 

First, and most blatantly because it sounds like you didnâ€™t actually do anything external. You canâ€™t feel guilty or be an asshole because of autonomic responses. You didnâ€™t CHOOSE to feel hurt and I personally donâ€™t feel like people are asses for things they didnâ€™t choose. 

Second, given only that information it definitely sounds to me like an unfair and hurtful situation. Iâ€™m sorry that you experienced that. I was raised in a large family and sometimes we didnâ€™t celebrate my birthday on my birthday because of scheduling conflicts. But it was still celebrated. Personally Iâ€™d say the parents are mostly the asses. Because I think parents are responsible for being more nurturing than they were. But the sisters were definitely being inconsiderate."

LifeProTips,fb9ojgb,t1_fb9asc7,1576644430.0,Just because something isnâ€™t marketable doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t beneficial. Hobbies can be really important for peopleâ€™s mental health even if they donâ€™t benefit from them financially. This is especially true for children.
