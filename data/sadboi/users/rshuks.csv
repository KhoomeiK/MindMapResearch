Read about bpd, dr Daniel Fox is a good YouTuber, you have worth and value. I’m still scared and lonely, I’m still very hurt at times, but I fucking matter. He’s not the right person for you if he didn’t stand by you. You’ve been through a lot and you deserve someone who doesn’t focus blame on your behaviour but sees how much you’re hurting inside and wants to be supportive in you getting through that trauma.

Everything about this experience will try to convince you you have no worth and you can’t be loved, but you’ll find yourself again with time. You are worthy of love and worthy of being stood beside, you’ll find a partner some day who won’t leave you because you are struggling. And also you won’t leave yourself, you can dm me if you’re feeling helpless because of all of this, I’ve been through it too quite recently and I know there’s hope.

CPTSD,f0o7ig8,t3_d5mpxr,1568799870.0,"Yep feels like people don’t get it when they say you’re so strong, you survived, as if living in fear, pain, shame and suffering is surviving.

I’m not an outwardly depressive type of person, but in my teens maybe, I started to think to myself “I get that I’m alive, but it’s as if I’m already dead”, it’s like I’ve given up hope of having a life where I am loved and safe

Being alive, just simply living through trauma doesn’t mean you aren’t crippling damaged by it to the point that you aren’t really living"
BPD,f0heumd,t1_f0havbv,1568620053.0,"I’m probably best described as high functioning quiet borderline as well. Although I’ve become less functioning over the years. I can be a good communicator in terms of relating with others and engaging with them when things aren’t hostile in any way. I’m quite able to be outgoing and stand up for myself with people I’m comfortable with, not necessarily people I know. Although when my self esteem is low the people I feel comfortable around usually whittles down to about one or two.

But if I ever feel threatened or like someone is trying to get power over me by making me look weak and less than, or say I wanted to debate with someone who I didn’t feel too confident that they’d take me seriously, they might outright reject me as an idiot - well I struggle to find my voice in those scenarios, and I become extremely passive and quiet. I may not speak at all. I may feel that I’m going to burst into tears, but my instinctive reaction is to cower and allow defeat.

I feel like the way I see other people with BPD dealing with these threats and emotions that I mentioned in my post, is to attack/to fight, and my natural response has become flight... I know it wasn’t always that way, I attempted to stand up to myself in the past, my dad and step mum used to be very cruel to me, and most often just frequently diminishing of me, and due to lack of social ability I couldn’t work out how to stand up for myself, there were times when I’d try and I might cry and they’d attack me for being so pathetic. I think I lost confidence in my ability to protect myself, and I honestly think I feel incapable of doing it now as an adult because I know it’s highly likely that I’ll just completely overwhelm myself emotionally and end up crying like a small child. I’m scared to revert like that because I won’t get taken seriously then for sure!

So at the end of the day, wow my dad fucked me up"
depression,f0c58wh,t1_f0a6rpc,1568535905.0,"Yeah I totally agree, good social responses have the power to make you feel like something and the power to break you. It’s important to self validate yeah but we’re social creatures and other peoples responses to us do effect us, which is why it’s frustrating when we can’t be the bubbly people we once were. I feel that way too, it’s definitely a disconnect, I started looking at people I’d known for years and felt like a completely different person, I couldn’t remember how to connect to them. I used to do the same, say all kinds of dumb stuff, people liked it, but things just kept hurting me in my life and I didn’t feel like making jokes anymore, I wanted to connect to someone in a more serious way, to feel able to share that pain with someone. It feels like you’re nothing, because you’re isolated in your pain, but you’re not nothing. From an outer perspective you’re someone who’s in pain, that’s not someone who’s empty, it’s the opposite. You’re a full human being who’s in unbearable pain"
depression,f0c2m4c,t1_ezz4kk0,1568534921.0,"I feel like life experiences can knock us back, for me usually the only thing which gives me some clarity is doing something very new or unusual. For example I went to a festival a month ago, after 5 months of seeing no friends, I booked it on a whim. I was still depressed at the festival, still strange to be around, I spent 3 of the daytimes in the tent and I cried on my own, but there were moments where I had fun, I felt new feelings! I feel like they’re harder to get through when we’re depressed, maybe we can’t spend the whole evening excited and laughing, but feelings can get through, just flickers but it’s enough to work with. When I left the festival I was in a good mood, and had hope which was non existent before. When you do something that could bring you a bit of enjoyment that you haven’t done in so long, sometimes this can spark a moment of hope that you might be able to work from. So I am depressed still now, but if I had kept up doing new things, I think I would have been on a better path already. When we get depressed things aren’t enjoyable that once were, but maybe we need to push ourselves to do things that are more powerful, to get through to us. Just think is there one thing that might give you some enjoyment, and keep looking for things like that, that give you a chance to trigger a new perspective. Another one which usually has the power to get through to me is going hiking. I hope this helps, it’s just something to try, obviously it doesn’t cure grief and pain but it can be helpful to try and find curiosity in life again and boost our confidence. It can also help to do things for yourself, as it reminds us we are deserving of being taken care of, even by ourselves!"

It does hurt a lot because I tried so hard to have a good relationship with him, however I do believe there are other people who will be validating of my experience. And you have done that as well so thank you. 

I agree, I’ve done so much research and there’s really so little out there to help with the core of BPD. Like the abandonment and attachment issues aren’t really approached. I’m on the NHS waiting list for ECS atm, which is DBT without one on one therapy, I’m hoping that it helps. I know what you mean, it’s been years since I was diagnosed and I feel like I’ve just been so on my own with it. I’ve tried to find bpd support groups and there’s just nothing in the UK!

I wanted to live but to be different, to be better, to be happy. It can be quite invalidating when people say “just focus on the positives”, “be grateful”, I think the most important thing is actually realising you are worthy. You don’t owe anyone anything, but you owe yourself some respect. I tell myself horrible stuff like you do, but I bet you know that if you got a chance to actually see yourself without bias, you’d acknowledge that you do actually have good qualities as well as bad. I scroll through reddit and see people writing shit that literally could have come out of my own mouth, you have no idea how many people feel the same as you. And I don’t necessarily find that reassuring either haha! But I guess what it shows is that a lot of people have this crap in their head, but also a lot of people change don’t they. If you keep trying to give yourself a little bit of compassion when you feel driven to talk down to yourself, slowly, just bit by bit, it will become habit and you’ll find your self worth. And realise you were always worthy, you’re not always going to feel this way and be trapped in this thought process. The people around you are not more worthy than you, we’re all as unworthy as each other so there’s no need to disrespect yourself. I have the same feelings, currently living with it, but also sometimes I get some clarity and realise nope, I’m not just a ball of evil!!!"

I am so sensitive to this as well, just wondering, did your parents speak to you like you were dumb? Because in my case my dad (I didn’t have a mum growing up), used to both shout at me and talk to me like an idiot, but I actually find people being disrespectful to be probably more triggering. Because there’s something less obvious about it, something people can get away with, but it’s actually almost more damaging than shouting because it just totally devalues you and makes you feel worthless. So if you had a parent who was like this with you, I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s got a part to play in why you get triggered by that now. And there is absolutely no shame in how you feel btw, it’s not your fault, I literally know exactly how it feels when people say hurtful stuff like that and you just burst into tears, and you deserve a hug because it’s the worst!!!"

Who even if this person? It’s not me. I’ve been this way for years now, and it’s hard to not wonder if it is who you are.

They’d also hear me blowing up at him for hours too and that makes me so ashamed. BPD has lead me to do hundreds of humiliating things, where people have come to the solid conclusion that I’m a crazy nasty selfish monster. But it isn’t true, even then it wasn’t true, you have to show compassion to your past self. You were never a bad person, you were just afraid, in pain, threatened. Yeah I did fucked up things and I still do when I’m in an overwhelming environment, but I care about others, I don’t want to upset anyone, I have been through a lot and I’m trying every day to find some way to heal from my childhood, which is so prevalent in my behaviours now.

I want to make a career out of it so that 1) I can afford to live independently and 2) in reality with all my MH issues, I am never gonna have to energy to work all day and then do my hobbies at the end of the day (I suffer from a lot of fatigue). Yeah I get that, I don’t want some big impressive job, I just want to find something that I’m passionate about which is an addition to the relationships in my life.

BPD,eyooxn9,t3_cxskso,1567280771.0,"I feel the same way, sometimes it feels like we don’t have a hope of getting through the pain we’ve experienced and having a life like all the people around us seem to. I often feel like I’m watching everyone around me live and grow whilst I’m trapped and stuck somehow. But I think that’s part of BPD, part of this illness is learnt helplessness, a feeling we can’t save our selves, because at the time we were abused we could not. Please don’t stop trying, skills are helpful but trying to find a way to grieve your past might be really helpful in getting further in your life. Someday you’ll accept your past, you’ll have grieved the time you lost, and what was taken from you, and you’ll have new things in your life, new people and interests. I know it’s hard that things didn’t go anything like you hoped or deserved, it kills me every day that I’m in the place I am right now, but you never know what could be coming. Just hold on to hope, no matter what I’m not letting go of hope, I feel broken too, but I know I don’t deserve to feel that way and someday I won’t. Nobody is eternally broken, it can certainly feel that way, but all people can heal, in the future you’ll still have difficult memories and you may always have some symptoms from your trauma, but there WILL be a time when it finally doesn’t rule your life anymore, there will be more and you will feel like a real, integrated person, and you’ll forgive yourself for the time you had to suffer to get there. People do recover from BPD, people do recover from trauma, there’s no reason you can’t too.

BPD,eybmbci,t1_eyas18i,1566987667.0,"Yeah for sure, I feel like inner child work/ re parenting is gonna be a big part of my healing. It feels important to look into current patterns and beliefs and how they formed in childhood.
But I was also thinking about victim mentality, I feel like part of why I’ve been so stuck is because I haven’t taken full responsibility for my own life and wellbeing yet. Wanting someone to guide you/save you, keeps you from being accountable for your own life, and keeps you a victim really, the one without power. I just feel like for me I need to take a step back from that perspective, because even though it does justify what I’ve been through and the fact that I was a victim, it gives away my power and control now. It doesn’t seem helpful anymore in adulthood to be a victim who wants to be saved.
It’s probably off on a tangent but I just feel like it’s part of what has kept me from moving forward"
BPD,ey98vmn,t1_ey8fb5d,1566937844.0,"Really resonate with this. In childhood I often felt helpless and was fed messages that I was not capable of things on my own, I fell for it and became comfortable with not making decisions for myself, with being told what I like. But since being thrown into adult life - I’ve realised how disabling that is. We definitely deserve to be in control of our own lives and that will always be more rewarding and meaningful than having someone else direct it"
BPD,ey981tw,t3_cvyqhz,1566937317.0,"BPD makes us badly equipped for adult life, it’s not our fault, we are wounded people and it’s difficult to take care of ourselves when we don’t know who we are and are plagued with shame and low self esteem. It is not a surprise adult life is so hard, I often feel like a child walking around in complete fear being forced to be an adult which I am not. At points I have fantasised about what you’ve said, I just want to be guided and have a parent figure to take care of me. For years I’ve found it impossible to choose my career and I feel like I’d be happy to work towards one if someone just told me what I’m destined to be doing! With exes I have tended to become dependent and want them to save me. I’ve always wanted to be rescued/taken care of. We weren’t nurtured enough to develop a real sense of identity or self esteem or develop the ability to regulate our emotions independently. BPD is like having the inability to achieve autonomy - not our fault but it’s what we have to work through. I think it’s strongly linked to how we were treated growing up, for example my dad constantly told me I was a child and unable to do anything right, slowly beating down my trust in myself and belief that I can govern my own life. It seems the only way out of this need to be parented/guided/saved is taking responsibility for our recovery. It’s true we were victims, but it may not be possible to save ourselves if we don’t change our perspective and see that we can change our own lives. We can take the power back and learn how to be autonomous, please don’t give up. I know how hard it is what you’re going through right now! I’m in the middle of it too, I think recovering from bpd may be taking responsibility for our lives, I don’t mean drowning in shame for our mistakes or saving ourselves because nobody else cares, I mean if we learn how to take back the power our childhood took from us then we’ll no longer be victims to it. And we may well be able to beat the illness"

It may be meant as an encouragement or a judgement, either way it’s more about how they don’t feel comfortable with you and want to change your behaviour.

For me I chicken out of buying the ticket because I don’t have any shorts that fit me atm and I also worry that I may have a mood swing in the class where I feel like a scared child/depressed,  But if the ticket was paid for I would be far more inclined to just accept that I’m going and go still. So I will try and find some shorts and then book the class"
