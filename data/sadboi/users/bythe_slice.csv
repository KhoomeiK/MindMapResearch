You definitely have time before this goes to collectors and it may never get there at all! You should call the hospital ASAP and discuss an interest free payment plan AND a discount. Both are possible. There are a lot of resources out there, but here's a simple article to point you in the right direction: [https://www.moneyunder30.com/paying-medical-bills-you-cant-afford](https://www.moneyunder30.com/paying-medical-bills-you-cant-afford)"
BPD,esmlfhk,t3_c8difs,1562108293.0,"Thank you! I did great in high school - academically speaking. Grades were a crazy focal point of my life. My temporary dip out of the top 10 students in my grade sent me into an absolute, self-harm fueled spiral. I actually think my compulsive attention to school and grades was - in part - due to my BPD and my desperate attempts to feel valid and gain parental approval."
BPD,es1om5r,t3_c5d5hw,1561501797.0,"I 100% do this. I do it less now that I'm aware of my BPD and my horrendous impulse control. I'm always chasing the novel - I want new people and new experiences constantly. I think because I've seen how I go up in flames if I stay in one place long enough - if I keep things moving, I don't get the chance to burn."
BPD,es19dvv,t1_es1421z,1561491919.0,"Wow, sounds like you really handled that well! Way to go! :D"
BPD,er69xi9,t3_c0nwg0,1560543069.0,"As someone living outside your head, it sounds like you're okay! I get the concern that your reputation with your manager might've changed, but it sounds like you're usually a reliable employee and your honesty is going to go a long way in solidifying trust with him. Take the rest of the day and weekend to get healthy again! Your number one priority is you!"
BPD,er65gh9,t3_c0mwwf,1560540376.0,"Hey - I've been there too, not all that long ago. The most important thing you can do right now is **NOTHING**. I know the kinds of insane mood swings you're having - shame, anger, emptiness - the only way I know to get through a FP storm without doing something regrettable is just lay in bed, call in sick, do *nothing*. If you want, write a bunch of shit - but don't send it to anyone. That helps me.

I was there just a few weeks ago - drunkly googling suicide methods and crying uncontrollably and having no realistic way to explain to anyone how something as simple as a text exchange that feels ""off"" could put me in such an inconsolable state. I wrote and shower-rehearsed several different versions of telling my FP how they hurt and used me, or how angry I was, or how sorry I was - even within a few days, my opinions on my relationship changed. If I had sent or said any of those things, I would've fucked everything up. Instead, I chose inaction, and now, things have normalized a bit. At least I'm not feeling suicidal anymore, and I didn't harm the relationships I already had."
BPDrecovery,eqweaqi,t3_bzn6p7,1560356129.0,"I have the same concerns. As I try to regulate everything, it means I can't obsessively and compulsively reach out to people and I'm worried that those actions might be what's holding the relationships together. It's hard for me to stomach the truth that people do grow apart, it's okay to release old relationships that you're forcing to keep around.

To be honest, I feel like I'm very close to needing to start from scratch. Making a BPD reddit account was one of the ways I tried to not be alone. It's definitely working at some level, but I'm honestly just working on building normal, healthy relationships in the real world one careful, intentional step at a time."
BPD,eqsjy0l,t3_bzfwoc,1560286595.0,"Something definitely similar - I \*definitely\* get pigeon-holed as a manic pixie dream girl for some guys. I feel shitty, because I intentionally try to make them like me, then when they do, I get super frustrated. I feel like they project a lot of things on me like, ""You're always so spontaneous!"" Like, nah dawg, I'm impulsive. Or, ""It's incredible you can be so candid with me,"" after I share my sexual experiences or preferences. Wrong again - I will literally tell anyone willing to listen."
BPD,eqs9nwd,t3_bzequr,1560279897.0,"I don't think they necessarily need to know your diagnosis to figure out how you work and use it. Just last week I found out the extent to which my favorite person has lied and used me for sex. As soon as he found another outlet, he dropped me like a hot potato - saying he can't see himself having a platonic relationship. I made myself so readily available to him because I thought it was the only way to keep him around. I was disappointingly correct this time. :("
