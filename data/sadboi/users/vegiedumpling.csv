BPD,fhogmf4,t1_fhog7qe,1581755661.0,i think you were very wise in your decisions. cutting them off was definitely the right decision as they have clearly displayed their lack of empathy and care for you whilst being fully aware of your struggles. they aren‚Äôt the kind of people you want to surround yourself with. so kudos to you!
BPD,fhogh38,t1_fhog3cs,1581755446.0,"i guess it‚Äôs cause there was some structure there, where as in the real world you have to create your own. which is exhausting. and structure is a fundamental part of feeling close to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. having routine in your days makes you feel like you have purpose, intent etc. it‚Äôs great having someone else instil those for you, taking the pressure and effort off you. working is good as it does give you that structure and routine. i‚Äôm not one to talk as i‚Äôm unemployed cause i can‚Äôt cope with working rip. i‚Äôm doing a diploma in april for those reasons tho. distractions are always good for bpd. trust me i know :(("

BPD,fhof6zx,t3_f46bd1,1581753605.0,"firstly, i‚Äôm so sorry for your losses. time does not heal pain, but it does help you become better at coping. these friends of yours do not seem like friends at all imo. a simple ‚Äúhow are you doing?‚Äù is the very LEAST they could have mustered. if they were a genuine friends, i‚Äôd expect them to catch up with you, it‚Äôs not that hard to do for someone you care about even moderately. i‚Äôm sorry to put it bluntly. you deserve people who do care. these people seem to have their priorities set in the wrong places. i wouldn‚Äôt bother reaching out because i wouldn‚Äôt expect much back :/ take some time to heal with your family for now. maybe try and reach out to new people? if that isn‚Äôt a possibility, and you‚Äôre really struggling with lack of friends, reach out to the ones you mentioned again and see how they respond, as a kind of experiment to see how they welcome you. that‚Äôs what i‚Äôd do anyway. either way, i think it would be best to move on and find some new, authentic friends. because fake friends aren‚Äôt friends. they‚Äôre just people to fill your time. i‚Äôm sorry for the long message! all the best of luck!"
