Same could be said for Marvel. 

I think Pixar is like any other creative entity. You have hits and misses depending on a huge variety of variables (leadership change, for starters). But to think their successes or failures hinge solely on the “Disney” side of Disney Pixar is thinking about it too simplisticly. Not to mention forgetting about all the critical and commercial successes they’ve seen since the purchase in 2006"
