Its like watching to people grow distant and closer at the same time, and I guess that's what was happening. There's so many emotions that flood back to me whenever I go through this account and all I ever do is reminisce about the feelings we felt in those times. I'm so proud of us for not only pulling through but being able to grow and still be able to love each other even more so. Ever since we reconnected things (in my opinion) have just been getting better and better. I love you so much. I'm so glad I stuck with you. I would do it all again. You're worth it."
