MMA,fqxn6id,t1_fqwgz15,1589734890.0,"Did you watch the NFL Draft this year?  *THAT* was gross, they were capitalizing off of every tragic death or sob story that could.  The broadcast was done by ESPN as well, however, I can't help but feel like this broadcast was the opposite of gross, since it was Walt's decision to sit down in front of the cameras and tell his story.  HE wanted to get the word out and tell people what and who he was fighting for.  I find nothing about that to be disgusting, I find it only to be inspiring and emotional.  During the draft, ESPN was airing out everybody's dirty laundry just for the drama and ratings, and it was disgusting and wrong because not once did we get to hear it from one of the players, it was always the network doing it for their own benefit, not the players'.  Walt went through a tragedy and hit rock bottom, and he fought his way back into the octagon and wanted the world to know his story, I don't think that's gross, I think that's inspiring.

The best D-backs we've gotten in recent years have all been un-drafted, and yet here we are over and over again wasting picks on DB's that aren't going to play for us.  Joejuan last year, Duke Dawson before that, and Cyrus Jones before that.  Other examples as you go further back, and all of them unbelievably terrible picks.  I expect nothing more from this pick.  I've been conditioned that way, I'm so disappointed.  We could have taken any other position and I would have found a way to be happy about this (despite how badly I wanted to take Kmet there).

edit: i doubt anyone will see this edit, but y'all are gonna eat crow so hard when he plays less than a hundred snaps this season.  On his call with Belichick immediately after being drafted, Bill was telling him about how he's not really going to play because he's behind a lot of good safeties already.  Which is entirely my point with how shitty of a pick this was.  We have actual needs on the team and this was a complete waste of a pick that we could have landed in the 3rd or traded up for.  Kmet is a legit talent at a position that we have ZERO talent at.  If the dude ends up being a great player then that's fantastic, but when the dude busts like all the other 2nd round reaches, you can't come crying to me."

Discover weekly playlist shows you music similar to what you have as saved or ""liked"" songs, and you get a new playlist every Monday. Listen to the playlist and save songs you like. You'll also get a playlist called ""Release Radar"" which shows you brand new tracks from artists you like/ artists you may like. The more music the save, the more accurate recommendations can become. Then you'll have multiple daily mixes which usually have songs you listen to regularly with a different song thrown in there every now and then. On top of ALL OF THAT, you can also follow people on Spotify, and it will show you the music they are listening to while they listen to it, and you can also check out all of their public playlists as well. I follow my favorite choreographers on Spotify, and often you see them listening to a song and then a few days or a couple weeks later you'll see a project of theirs pop up to that song, which is pretty fun. Sometimes I like to pretend I'm vibing with them and listen to what they're listening to and just freestyling to it :) Spotify has been my favorite way of finding new music for a long time now, I highly recommend it.

Main stream media doesn't want you to know that, they want to keep brainwashing you and the rest of the American public to vote against their best interests.  This is my last attempt to get you to understand that Bernie believes in the exact same ideals that FDR and MLK Jr fought for and believed in as well.  He hates the establishment just like you and I do.  If you truly hate the establishment the way it seems you do, you would take a moment to consider where you're getting your news from and the biases at play.  If you truly got your news from unbiased media (or at least media that clearly presents its biases) you would be able to clearly see the corruption at play here.  Bernie is fighting for you and me.  Again, let's join together and build a better world for ourselves and our children.  The facts are that we have been dealt a shit hand by the powers that be, and the goal of life is to always leave the world a better place than it was when you came into it.  We have a real opportunity here to bring real change to America and give *HOPE* to an entire generation of kids who currently see nothing but the fiery inferno that awaits them.  I can't think of a more noble cause than that of making the world a better place for *everyone*, not just a select few.

I say ALL of this out of love and concern for a fellow human.  I'm not arguing with you, I'm telling you the facts.  Join the political revolution and let's take our country back."

I'm definitely pointing out the people that i know that are working two or more jobs, and my situation is pretty specific, as I'm a dance teacher so to fill my schedule i HAVE to work at multiple studios. The vibe of my post was more centered around, ""if I know X many people that are in that situation, then how can it only be 5%?"" But now I understand 5% is actually 8 million people at least. And yes none of the people i know work two ""full-time"" jobs, but I also dont think that matters that much, if somebody has two work two jobs to make ends meet then it's because their first job isnt full time to begin with. That's just a little anecdote though.

Also yeah I don't blame Trump for the situation either. I'm of the understanding that the situation we have is because of a whole system, and years of corruption, not just the current President. Do I think he could be doing a better job? Absolutely, but I'm very aware that this didn't start because of him, however he hasn't done anything to help the situation in my opinion.

Also your point about having an extra job just for leisure is why I work once every other week at an Applebee's. Weed money babyyyyyy"

Why would the man that marched with MLK and has the exact same politics as him change his mind after risking his political career for it his whole life? Fake politicians take policy positions because they are politically expedient for them. Bernie has been standing up for civil rights issues since the civil rights movement began in the 1960's. He held gay and lesbian pride parades in the 80's. He has been fighting the same corruption that I'm talking about for his whole adult life, and you have the audacity to say he's lying. Tell me, why would he take those positions at the time that they were so taboo? Was it going to get him elected? Was it going to lead him to a prosperous life? No, it was because that's what he believes in as a moral and just person. And he fights for it the same way that I and millions of other people do.

There are thousands upon thousands of people who went and got thenselves a good degree, but unfortunately are working two or three part-time jobs to pay their rent,  It gets a lot more complicated when we start trying to factor these things in. So while it might sound bad, it might be better to just treat every degree the same. I do agree with you on this point, though. And also like you, I don't know the answer.

worldpolitics,fjo52cb,t1_fjo1wej,1583520684.0,"yes, I'm blaming other people for all of my problems. woe is me.  everybody feel bad for me. waaaaaaaaah

No. Nobody is blaming others for their misfortune.  We're merely looking at an injustice and trying to fix it.  I know the decisions I've made in my life and I'm very happy with them.  If I wanted to ""work harder"" to get a better living that would entail going to college and putting myself in the debt that we are talking about in other places in this thread.  The system is not designed for you to succeed.  It's designed for you to be a slave.  I chose to not play that game.  I'm a dance teacher, and I gladly make my living by teaching at multiple dance studios.  That's why I work multiple jobs. I work very hard and I love what I do, and I make enough to survive, but that is not the case for millions more Americans.

And did you know that having the highest median wages in the world doesn't mean shit when you're also being charged more than double the amount in healthcare costs?  Did you think about that? No you didn't, because you hear a number that fits your narrative and you don't do any critical thinking about it, you just spout it off and continue to give power to the establishment that gives no fucks about you.  Sad, really."
MurderedByWords,fjo4g3o,t1_fjo2wkd,1583520324.0,"I understand why you feel that way, it's absolutely human nature to feel that way.  For a personal example, my grandfather passed away from cancer two weeks ago.  The next day I heard a story about someone fully recovering from the same cancer and procedure my grandfather had, and I honestly couldn't give a shit in that moment.  It didn't feel fair that they got to live while my grandfather died.

The point here is that we shouldn't want ""bad"" for others just because we had it bad, too.  So in this case, it's completely and totally understandable that you would feel ""cheated"" in a way that you had to pay your debt off fair and square, and somebody else might get theirs paid off for them.  The idea of civilization and living is to make the world better for our young ones than we had it.  Just because we had a bad thing that doesn't mean that the future generations should also have to deal with that bad thing.  We have laws about wearing seat belts and having airbags in cars, we don't allow people to smoke in restaurants, we don't litter anymore, these are all things that the generations before us used to do, and they were all bad.  They got rid of them when they realized that they were bad for the future generations.  Even though it pains me to have lost my grandfather to cancer, I want them to find a cure so that nobody else has to lose their grandfather or anybody else to cancer.  It's the same idea with college loans, the same idea with healthcare... let's build a better future for our kids and grandkids!"
MurderedByWords,fjo3opy,t1_fjo1bo6,1583519878.0,"You've made a ton of assumptions in your comment, and have based your own arguments around those assumptions.  Engaging in semantics over the fact that more money will be in people's hands is pointless.  Trying to project ""trickle down economics"" onto me as if that's what we're talking about (it's not) is pathetic.  In relation to veterans (my brother served 16 years in the army), you've brought up a completely *separate* issue to the homelessness epidemic that I referred to.  A combat veteran should be taken care of in many different ways that has nothing to do with someone getting their loans paid off or not - those are completely separate issues.  You've been snarky, condescending, and patronizing in your comments, and yet you've dismantled exactly *zero* of my arguments.  I hope you can learn to be less aggressive in the future, as I'd actually love to engage in a civil discussion with you, but you're not showing that capacity.  

Lastly, I'm a dance teacher, by the way.  A teacher nonetheless, but you've made a pretty dumb assumption based off of the fact that my comments started with me saying I didn't go to college. If I was a school teacher and I was getting degree after degree, then I too would have student loan debt, and we've already covered that I do not have that.  If I did this conversation would have a biased opinion. So go ahead and gag harder, I guess? 

I love people and care about people.  You clearly don't love anybody but yourself.  You and I do not agree with each other, and since you've shown no ability to be civil in this discussion I will not be engaging in it further.  I wish you a good day and a healthy life."

1st and foremost, nice strawman. I don't ""think"" I'll get ""plenty of other cash benefits"", especially so since I didn't say that. I mentioned in my comment that if we also passed health care then I would save a lot of money. It's an overall point about how taxes are essential to a civilized society. If we pay our taxes and our money actually goes to things that matter and that benefit us, then in the short term **and** long term things will be better for *everybody*, not just a few lucky and privileged people. It's an atrocity that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world we have 500,000 individuals sleeping on the streets, including thousands of combat veterans. It's an atrocity that students go $60k-$100k in debt to get a degree to get a good job and live a good life and then not be able to get a job in their field and then have to workmultiple jobs just to barely be able to eat. The idea is that if we take care of our fellow citizens, then everything will be better, from an economic viewpoint as well as a standard of living viewpoint.

> - so not exactly altruistic as your ""I don't have student debt to be paid off"" is meant to imply. 

I'm not trying to pretend to be altruistic or anything at all for that matter. I'm saying how I honestly feel. I'm not out here trying to get approval from people who went to college and are suffering from crushing debt, I'm out here defending the ideas and policies that I believe in because I'm a moral person who wants to see real change in their country. If you got the ""implication"" that I'm being altruistic in my comment, it's because that's how I actually live my life. I care about other people and my country. I'm a teacher, my whole life is dedicated to giving knowledge to others and improving them as people. I've been a role model my whole life. My desire is for people to live good, comfortable lives, and I don't think that's very hard to believe, unless you yourself are an incredibly selfish person and you're just projecting your insecurities on to me."
worldpolitics,fjny86x,t1_fjnx19n,1583516726.0,"So I want to clarify that I do believe the statistic since it's an official number. I was more trying to get at the fact that 5% doesn't *sound* right. Somebody else below me mentioned that even if the number is accurate, which I'm sure it is (as I've stated, I was only expressing in my comment the feelings of denial I was having, not having the conviction of denial. I knew my comment was pretty vague / hard to comprehend because I was more or less rambling when i typed it), that the number would still represent at least 8 million Americans. So yes, I *feel* like it's more than 5%, because by nature when i read that number I thought ""barely anybody works more than one job"" not ""8 million people work more than one job"". Like I said, my siblings, my friends, even my mom works two jobs. It's incredibly common where I'm from, that's where the fallacy comes in, but when you extrapolate and realize that 5% means 8 million individuals then it makes it more digestible than it was at first.

no, I understand how it will be paid for because I've actually read Bernie's plans.  Yes, my taxes will increase, but I'll be saving more money on healthcare than I will be spending in taxes.  The money can and will come from many things, including the military industrial complex, a tax on Wall Street speculation, a wealth tax, and corporations actually paying their fair share of taxes.  We'll save millions on cutting out unnecessary administrative costs.  You or I will *not* experience any sizable negative repercussions, and in fact we and the economy will improve drastically with all this new money citizens will have access to.  

I'm 23 - I've been actually reading and critically thinking about political ideologies and world events for 5 years now.  Figure that out.

edit: and to add, the whole point of paying taxes is that it's a necessary evil if we want to live in a civilized society.  The way things are going, violent revolution is almost inevitable, we've been hearing people talking about eating the rich for a couple years now.

From 3rd grade at the earliest I can remember my teachers telling me about things that I'll need to do when I'm in college.  All through middle school and high school everything was about preparing you for what would be expected of you ""in college"", not ""in life"", and because of that you have thousands upon thousands of young people every year who apply and enroll in colleges after they graduate high school.  These young people often have no real plan for their continued education and realize after a semester or two that they've made a massive mistake, and drop out with $30,000 in debt after only a few months.  There are thousands and thousands of individuals in that situation every year because of the propoganda they're fed growing up.
