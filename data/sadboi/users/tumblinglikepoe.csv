I’m not too familiar with BPD, I know only a few things from what my boyfriend has explained to me about his ex. 

I’m honestly self conscious and terrified to talk to my psych because I feel like I’ll sound crazy and he’ll lock me away, so I hid a lot of stuff from him which my therapist has picked up on, and why he got me an appointment to see him sooner than originally planned. Usually he’ll ask about my week, meds (when I was on them), and any triggers or stressors, then he’ll increase or add on. So basically a quick overview of what I’ve talked to my therapist about. I’m dreading the conversation of “why didn’t you tell me this before,” but ready to get it over with and back on meds.

The toughest part is I only realize it sometimes. My therapist wants me to try and focus on what I’m feeling/doing pre-episode (once it’s over) so that we can identify triggers. I lose touch with reality a lot when it happens which becomes dangerous. Like he asked me about last week and for the life of me I can’t remember anything past “my moods fluctuated a lot.” After our talk he pulled some strings and was able to get me an appointment with my psych for this upcoming Monday, so I’m taking it that my revelation was concerning, but I’ll take it.

I had one therapy session about it then my parents stopped taking me. They never took my mental health serious and would often times use it against me. The episodes increased as I got older but was never everyday. Now I’m smelling things that trigger or worsen my mania, I’m hearing myself in my head have conversations/fights with people that have never actually happened, and I’m seeing things that haven’t happened. And it doesn’t help that I’ve been off meds for a little over a month because I couldn’t get in to see my psych.

I was misdiagnosed with major depression disorder in my late teens. When I was diagnosed with BP2 I wasn’t upset because in the back of my mind I knew. I’ve hallucinated since I was a child but my parents never took it seriously and I chopped it up as trauma related.

One day that missing piece will come and you’ll find something that’s worth it
bipolar,fgjra9m,t1_fgih5dn,1580849843.0,"I am on meds! In the beginning I was on 25mg of lamotrigine but there wasn’t much of an effect, so it was increased to 100mg. 

Alcohol def doesn’t help, it only increases the episode as you may have noticed 😅 so far I haven’t tried much to bring my hyperactive levels down. I’ve been trying to do everything at once, which only heightens is 😅

I’m not 100% sure about whether or not you personally could do it without. I know I had a very hard time reigning it in without it to the point where I was getting very angry and aggressive with driving and objects. But for you it may be different. I would consider talking to your doctor about it."
bipolar,fghtcrx,t3_eyhp49,1580793291.0,"Yes!!! So much truth in this! Everyday is battling your inner demon’s voice and reality. You don’t know whether your actions/thoughts/feelings are you or the diagnosis and it fucks you up. 

All we can do is keep pushing through and doing the best we can. Sending all sorts of love and support your way 💛"
Blogging,fghsazl,t1_fghrsdw,1580792437.0,"I get what you mean. If you think the posts are relevant to your niche and your new blog, then I think it’d be beneficial to keep them. Just tweak them a bit (update) and then re-introduce them on your social media or however you promote them."
bipolar2,fghre9b,t3_eykdzl,1580791735.0,"Is it the school work you’re finding a lack of interest in, or do lack interest in anything? Like are their any hobbies that you find that you do enjoy that you could turn into a career?"
bipolar2,fghr95m,t3_eyioon,1580791626.0,"My boyfriend, our dog, and my soon to be born niece. I try and sometimes succeed in wanting to live for myself and my goals in life, but when I really want to give up I think about those three and how I want to be around for a long to make memories with them and see their smiles."
bipolar,fghqzgb,t3_eyg9f1,1580791420.0,Bp2 human here. I told my therapist at my last session that I wanted to find a healthier way to get my energy out during my hypomanic episodes and mentioned embroidery. Does embroidering help you get out a good amount of energy and/or help keep your mind focused on just one thing?
Blogging,fghquvm,t3_eyj245,1580791326.0,"I think you could keep those posts (considering they drove traffic from the previous blog) and just update it so that it has a fresher look, y’know?"
bipolar2,fggzgtg,t1_fgea044,1580773081.0,Just ready in general. Like does your body/brain give a signal that you’re ready to try and move around or do you just do it?
BlackPeopleTwitter,fgguddk,t3_ey8bhx,1580769769.0,I thought Toni Lahren became irrelevant YEARS ago 🤔 the fact that she even thought to tweet that AND Jay-Z’s PAST shows just how annoying and problematic she is
bipolar2,fggtr31,t3_eycycf,1580769367.0,I’d say that mine gets worse. When I’m manic it’s usually intense energy or irritability/irrational. My mind moves much faster than my hands do so it’s barely legible
bipolar2,fggr64x,t1_fgey6nr,1580767734.0,"Just saying that is enough for me :)  I get so fatigued and self conscious that I don’t even want to get out bed and if I do, I usually end up right back where I started on the couch sulking. Unfortunately it’s going to be a trial and error thing until I can figure something out. 

I hope that you find some other healthy coping mechanism that work for you so you can rely on more than just one thing :)"
bipolar2,fggqxcf,t1_fgeupm7,1580767583.0,"I resonate with this so much! Subconsciously I know that what I’m thinking and feeling isn’t really me and has no weight behind it, but in that moment I believe everything my “inner demon” is trying to convince me of. 

I’ve been on mood stabilizers for a little over a month with a recent increase so I’m hoping that + therapy and learning coping mechanisms can help me handle this better than I have been. 

Thank you so much for this!"
bipolar2,fge2wxu,t1_fgdrlqy,1580690134.0,"I like to think that consciously I’ve accepted this, but subconsciously I’m still stuck in the “I hate it here.” 

So far, I’ve found that anytime I do something to get myself out of this funk when I’m not ready (like walk the dog, try and hold a normal conversation, clean, etc.), I start to cry before or after. 

You mentioned that if it takes you hours to get there you still count it as a win...how do you know  when you’re ready?"
Games,fgdv66e,t3_exnmus,1580687237.0,"If they could make a PC version that combines the story lines of Sims 2, the features (walking around town, cars, etc.) of Sims 3, and career mode of Sims 4 with the multiplayer option, life would be good."
bipolar,fgch38i,t3_exj26u,1580672599.0,"I suggest talking to your doctor about taking you off SSRI’s altogether. With bp2 you’re going to experience depression and going into hypomanic states, so there should be a mood stabilizer that could work for you and battle both. With SSRI’s you’re only battling one, while the other is getting heightened."
insomnia,ffvu71z,t3_evdwrb,1580273374.0,"I’m not sure if you see a doctor for your insomnia or anything else, but I think it’s definitely a good idea to tell them what’s going on. I’ve had insomnia for years and over the counter sleeping pills, melatonin, and the old “warm milk before bed” never worked for me. My doc prescribed me amitriptyline and it’s worked wonders so far"
BipolarReddit,ffsf88q,t3_eur442,1580180250.0,"I have to take my mood stabilizers by noon, or else I have to wait until the next day because they won’t take the full effect in time. So I have an alarm set for right after my first work alarm, that way I can actually get out of bed to get my meds + get ready."
bipolar,ffjqdwz,t3_etmed5,1580004281.0,"I had someone look at me with a worried expression and said “your eyes are bloodshot,” and I didn’t know how to explain that I have bp2 and don’t sleep during my hypomania 🙃

My doc prescribed me some sleeping pills and I feel like I’m getting less sleep with them"
