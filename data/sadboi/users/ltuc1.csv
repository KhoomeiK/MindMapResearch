depression,fr44rax,t3_gmdwmu,1589875774.0,I've felt this as well. There's times where it's not about living bout more about how little I care about what's going on or how little I can focus on it. It scares me honesty but idk what to do about it.
depression,foors2s,t3_g8nfod,1587945089.0,"Yeah I definitely get what you're saying. Currently where I'm at, I'm bored to death. Nothing here interests me anymore and I want a big change of scenery, but I don't really have control over that for a while. I keep watching different TV shows and keep wishing I was in their shoes. It's hard and I don't really know how to deal with it :/"
depression,fetps7l,t1_fesu55j,1579378126.0,"as much as it hurts, it's going to be okay, i don't really know your situation tho. relationships are hard and that was a main reason that my mental health was in the gutter for a bit. if a relationship isn't beneficial to you, you need to get rid of it. you have to keep going, because eventually, you will look back and see that you were better than her, cheaters are low, but you will get through it. we're rooting for you <3"
