Albuquerque,fqidcsp,t3_giu0nx,1589394491.0,"People will probably hate my for saying this but yes I do think we should open up. If someone isn't comfortable with it then they can stay home, as simple as that. I have people coming into my work complaining that we don't wear gloves for a second. It baffles me because the customers don't wear gloves OR masks and have the audacity to complain. like why are YOU not doing anything to keep MY health in check. Why do you go out if you're worried about getting sick?? Opening with restrictions is okay. Like we keep saying, no matter what, the numbers will rise. You can call me an asshole, selfish, anything but to me, things like going to the gym helped my mental health to no end. I know I'll personally follow the rules, but will everyone else?"

shameless,fpv0alc,t1_fpsvqns,1588930190.0,This one hits deeper than home cause I saw my mom do the exact same thing when I was 8. So it kind of gave me a flashback. My mom was bipolar and even though she might have seemed crazy i know people like her never had bad intentions of hurting anyone near her. Im bipolar too and I'm hoping to break the family curses of depression and being bipolar. So far I'm succeeding more than she ever did so wish me luck.

Albuquerque,fp6wc9y,t3_gb6md0,1588359722.0,Right before the pandemic hit I was getting ready to start college at CNM to get ready to quit the job I hate and now I can't get a hold of the place. I was starting to hit the gym and get all my shit together. Just recently my gf broke up with me and I literally have no friends to hang out with and vent to like she does. Life is great!!!

FFVIIRemake,for6wqk,t1_for5hww,1588007199.0,I definitely agree with the music part. When the cutscene played I was ohhhh okay it just sounds like game over music. Also agree with it not being completely terrible but couldve been better.

college,fmwon7d,t3_fxuzw8,1586450304.0,"I'm 21 and since I graduated high school I was working shitty jobs. At some point worked 2 at once and even then I didn't make a livable wage, I didn't have any time to enjoy life, just for pennies. I'm more than ever motivated to go to school cause I don't want to live in the same cycle. If I'm in huge debt at least I'll have the job I want, the education I needed. At least the stress will just be temporary compared to how it WILL pay off later on. I'll do anything to get out of the cycle I hate, but this pandemic postponed it for me even further. As soon as it blows over I'm going all out. Just realize that when you leave you'll regret it fully. You'll live the rest of your life wondering why you didn't finish what you should've."

FFVIIRemake,fmdvcg7,t3_fumnqs,1585979148.0,"This game was a huge part of my life. I started FF with FF Crisis core and I was blown away. That game was my whole childhood. All of my happy memories were with it and I always wanted to know what happened after until I found out that what happened after was already out for so many years!!! And then I played the og ff7 and I was in love. The music, the characters, the depth that they entail. I played the game over at least 7 times putting over 60 hours into it each time. I'm seriously even getting tattoos from the game soon after this outbreak blows over. My passion and love for this game is almost embarrassing, but on this subreddit I can share with many people the same feelings I have."
