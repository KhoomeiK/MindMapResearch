gaming,fnvz31u,t1_fnvx7k5,1587308047.0,"That doesn't address the fact Kunos can laser scan the tracks and not charge like iRacing do...

And I thought the new tyre model fixed that? I knew the old one was garbage, just going off what I'm told though.

Fact is, they would likely get a hell of a lot more subs if it weren't so damn expensive, which would offset the lower price. Kunos can do it, Codemasters can do it (they send a team to each location to survey it to make their stages - although they do embellish them sadly). I would be extremely surprised if iRacing couldn't do it.

Honestly the only major thing I see that separates them from Kunos is them running servers, and maybe more in detail physics."
gaming,fnvw01s,t1_fnvralb,1587306078.0,"lol that was never asked. And its niche, but it's very popular within that niche.

Hell, actual race series like V8 Supercars are using it for 'official' races and broadcasts while we're on lockdown."
gaming,fnvvfqg,t1_fnvqh8c,1587305701.0,"I don't do iRacing, mostly cause I'm broke lol

I don't buy into the laser scanning being so expensive thing. Kunos do laser scanned tracks too for Assetto Corsa; all tracks in ACC are laser scanned - they even flew to Australia to scan Bathurst themselves. Only Zandvoort & Trento in the original AC weren't scanned. They manage to keep it affordable. I've even heard the laser scan data for the Nordschleife is actually the from the same source for iRacing, Assetto Corsa and Raceroom. I've been led to believe the Oran Park iRacing scan data was actually from a student project done before the track was demolished. That scan data is still available to other parties AFAIK.

The work they do on physics - OK. They have an insane amount of detail in their new tyre model, right down to cutting up actual race tyres to get it right. Still, just a sub would surely cover the continual Dev work.

The business model is just over the top, I could understand buying the game outright and then DLC on top, or a bit more expensive sub, but as it is is just insane."

I also get massive hot/cold flushes, nausea and bad headaches if I go off them. I literally can't stand up it gets that bad.

It works long term, if you can deal with the side effects. The excess sweating is the biggest pain for me lol

Probably best to talk to your doctor of course, and please get someone to keep an eye on you if you're going to stay off them, at least until your mind calms down."

Was studying to try and open my own business, finally picked up some work & even started dating after my partner of 8 years left me end of September last year. Figured out I was bi and came out to my friends, which was a huge relief. Then wham, COVID-19, right as I hurt my back and couldn't work any more. Gym closed and I couldn't work out at home.

I spent about 2 weeks down in the dumps, stress eating and going suicidal. Thankfully I live with friends and was able to talk to them about it.

I've been lucky, my financial situation is set to improve due to the support packages put in place by the Aus government which has helped a lot. I've found working out in my room and going for runs has been a massive boost to my mental health, as well as talking to people online (admittedly on Tinder lol). Gaming has been a massive boost too, as I've still been able to catch up with friends and other people online. Highly recommend checking that out if you're able!"
