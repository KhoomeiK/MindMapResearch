BPD,fnolmix,t1_fnnhggv,1587128387.0,"It's fucking exhausting. You actually start to feel hopeful when you're in the active, motivated mindset and then once you feel yourself start to spiral back down, the whole world becomes dark and empty again. It just exhausts me."
BPD,fn23wr7,t3_fyq6c4,1586577173.0,"I'm so sorry :( currently I am feeling the same way - laying in bed, wishing I could kill myself but mostly wishing I had done it all those years ago. What have I achieved in those years? What have I truly come to? The people in my life would be better off without me. The people I love would be sad, maybe even devastated, but they would do better off without me."
BPD,fmy4m6n,t3_fwbgnw,1586478011.0,"Sorry, I guess I don't have any coping mechanisms to stay way from self harm, I just wanted to say I really relate to your post. This quarantine has my mental health 100x worse than it was, and it's not like I can go see my therapist now (which wasn't helping) or find any other help. I've been self harming badly again, which I haven't done (regularly) for two or three years. I feel completely lost and hopeless. I have those ups and downs several times throughout the day and it causes me to split on my FP. This is driving me mad and I'm not sure how I'm going to survive like this for much longer."
BPD,fmp6aip,t1_fmp429n,1586275230.0,"When I'm in those moments where I'm totally dissociating and feel reality slipping, I feel like I'm totally making it up, just like you said. I've been experiencing a lot of the things you explained just about every night and then I get very suicidal and sometimes self-harm if I can't handle it. This quarantine is really wearing down on my mental health. I can't keep up with school (online) and I haven't felt like an actual human in so long. 
I'm glad you're feeling better! And I'm glad you were able to recognize some of those similar feelings in your past. I hope we can both stay strong during this period and take care of ourselves. And when we can get back into the world - see our friends, go to work, go back to therapy - hopefully we can really work on ourselves and get better. All the best to you ðŸ’•"
BPD,fmoqaar,t3_ftphkq,1586266127.0,"Hi, I was scrolling through posts and saw this. I know you posted four days ago, so how are you feeling now?? Are you still experiencing these feelings? I'd have to say that this definitely sounds like dissociation."
BPD,fm2srsb,t3_fsjill,1585704578.0,"Wow... Same. It scares me how these subconscious behaviours of mine are so manipulative. Someone does something minor, like not respond to me for hours or my teachers and parents seem to give me too much hassle for not trying hard enough and I think to myself, ""well, they'd really regret all this if I fucking killed myself."" It's such a toxic way to think, but I hate myself for it when I catch myself thinking this way, cause I don't ever want to be that manipulative stereotype."
BPD,fl3l311,t1_fl351xd,1584789002.0,Yes exactly. I think I could handle a week up and a week down more. The crazy mood swings every second is so exhausting. I can't stand it.
BPD,fl3l015,t1_fl3dqi7,1584788893.0,"I love the way you described this - an envelope without flesh, bones, and thoughts. And I think that could do with the disassociation that can come with. You feel totally unreal. It makes me feel entirely uncomfortable to exist. It's a terrifying and frustrating feeling."

BPD,fl2zt2d,t1_fl1oqe2,1584764391.0,I watched the videos on ADHD that you recommended. I found that I related to them very much. It's so hard to talk to people about it though. My family thinks I'm just being melodramatic and I can't seem to talk to my therapist properly and openly. It's so frustrating. I really don't know what to do.
BPD,fl1ook2,t1_fl1nkek,1584733168.0,Thank you! I appreciate these sources. I'm going to check them out.
BPD,fl12fdo,t1_fl0y2ta,1584720683.0,"Really? I had never thought of that. I've occasionally wondered if AD/HD could be another problem of mine, but I just brush it off. I see a therapist, but for some reason I find it extremely difficult to share these things with her. I don't know why. I've never seen a psychiatrist, because my parents do not want me taking medication. I'd love to figure put what exactly is wrong though. Thank you for your input!"
BPD,fl0tia9,t1_fl0t7sk,1584715397.0,"Right... That confused, dazed feeling like you woke up on the wrong planet when you wake up in the morning. It's so unsettling to me and really makes me feel uncomfortable. My bursts of inspiration are useless and just exhausting, because like you said, I either take too long to get up or I over think it too much, so then that burst of mental and/or physical energy just makes me feel extremely exhausted."
BPD,fl0opj3,t1_fl0n7va,1584712232.0,"Oooh yeah. Later after having made promises and plans to people when feeling good and motivated, I feel like absolute shit and have no ounce of mental or physical energy to do these things that I've said I would do."
BPD,fl0jhms,t1_fl0iyvh,1584708337.0,"It definitely does help to know I'm not alone, because I'm surrounded by people who don't understand me, and it gets very overwhelming."
BPD,fl0jfgw,t1_fl0iifp,1584708287.0,Oh man! Our brains are absolutely crazy. It seems like something that no one can explain. I really hope we can find some real happiness and stability in the future.
BPD,fl0ies3,t1_fl0hh3g,1584707410.0,"It's really bizarre and confusing. It's like our brains are simply there to sabotage us. I still get the little, happy outbursts of energy on my shitty days for no good reason. I wonder what's going on in our brains to make that happen?? Maybe your therapist would be able to share the chemistry of the brain that causes this?"
BPD,fl0i9ff,t1_fl03wa1,1584707277.0,"This is just the worse. Many times going into something like work or school, I will feel absolutely on top of the world and like I can conquer anything that will come my way. And then practically as soon as I get there, I'm practically on the brink of breaking down and feeling completely overwhelmed at the thought of going in. It feels like we can't do anything at all - going to work, visiting an old friend - because our brains always have a way to sabotage us and make us feel like shit."
BPD,fl0i3as,t1_fl01ite,1584707123.0,"Perhaps this is our mania. I completely relate to ""it feels out of my control and like I'm going for a ride."" These feelings are so intense and out of nowhere, it feels like someone is yanking on some strings attached from me like I'm just a limp puppet. I can't stand it."
BPD,fl0hxl8,t1_fl013rt,1584706980.0,"Oh yeah, I'm usually alone when these little episodes happen, too. I guess when we're alone our heads have more space to over think things and get totally out of control. I don't know about you, but I feel like people with BPD keep their disorder so invisible. Yeah, people probably think I'm a bit weird at times, but they'd never guess that my brain is an absolute war zone. I guess we just keep it pretty under control and then once we are alone, our brains start screaming at us."
BPD,fkzyhm5,t1_fkzxgt0,1584684543.0,"I would definitely describe them as manic episodes. Like literally in the last couple of hours, I've gone from feeling just okay whilst I was getting some schoolwork done, to suddenly feeling downright miserable, wanting to cry, feeling like my mind was screaming at me, and wanting to hurt myself. And then I started to feel okay again and actually felt a bit happy and hopeful that tomorrow (well I guess today? It's 2 am here) will be a better day. And I just kept fluctuating with those two feelings. It's absolutely exhausting."
BPD,fkzxbpd,t1_fkzx4n0,1584683370.0,"Yep. Same - quiet, introverted, extremely hard on myself. I have phases of feeling okay, and sometimes even good about myself, and then phases of extreme self-loathing. I am such a disaster. It's nice to know I'm not the only one. It's impossible to explain this to the people around me, which makes it all the more frustrating."
BPD,fkzv3de,t3_flp7oe,1584681292.0,"Oh my god. Yes. It's so fucking exhausting. There's a constant war in your head. One second, you're thriving and proud of yourself for thinking rational thoughts and allowing yourself to be okay and then the next second you begin spiralling down toward a pit of depression, anxiety, and panic as you realize that maybe all these crazy thoughts are true. So fucking over it lately."
BPD,fjjjh3t,t1_fjicgum,1583399024.0,I'm so sorry you were experiencing these feelings. It's honestly such a terrifying feeling when you feel that heavy weight on your chest and what feels like a tornado inside you as you begin spiralling down. And then the humiliation that sets in after is like a stinging slap in the face. Whenever I act like this I feel completely unworthy of anyone's love or support. Like... I'm just this toxic person who acts like a three year old when she gets overwhelmed. I wonder what it's like to have a mind that deals with things pretty rationally most of the time.
BPD,fj8thd2,t3_fc2juh,1583121794.0,This is so painfully accurate. You described it perfectly. It makes me feel like a psycho the way I wait on my FP to text me back and then read into every little thing he does and doesn't say. Makes me hate myself.
BPD,fj8sr0j,t3_fbzli0,1583121246.0,"Yes I do :( I try not to, because it's such an unhealthy, spiraling thought pattern, but sometimes it just creeps into the back of your mind unannounced. I try to rationalize though and not let it negatively effect me. Also, I have never had a sexual relationship before him. He's the first one I've done anything with, but he went through a phase of being with quite a few people. Sometimes it makes me feel extremely insignificant ðŸ˜¥"
unpopularopinion,fj84vz4,t3_fbvj43,1583105211.0,"I 110% agree with this guy and I do work a minimum wage job where I (almost) always put my full effort in. I think of my coworkers, because I want their shift to run smoothly and the work ethic I was raised with pushes me to work hard no matter what. The longer I stay with this job, the harder I find it in me to put the full effort in, though. I'm a college student and earning minimum wage is not gonna fucking cut it. I work too hard to be earning next to nothing. The company I work for is sitting on bags of money and all they can afford to pay me is minimum wage?? They spread all their ""good ethics"" and care for their employees around, but it never comes back around to us. OP has lots of goos points. And for those raising equally good points about mom and pop shops or situations where they worked hard for min. wage and ended up promoted, etc., OP was referring to these types of shitty companies."
BPD,fj3t60y,t1_fj3rfo0,1582992627.0,"I don't know that authentic and genuine love is foreign to us... Yes, we often feel intense feelings that are not true, like infatuation. But some of us are in relationships where we truly love the other person. Sometimes we still act crazy with it... But it's genuine. I don't go through some of the shit I go through because it's not real..."
BPD,fistwup,t1_fish3i1,1582693239.0,"Literally this. I marvel at how intensely and intricately my mind perceives art - music, poetry, you name it... It makes me feel like an outsider, because I know normal people aren't experiencing it in the way I am, but I also fucking love it. It's incredible. Like we have this part of ourselves that's unlocked that other people will never be able to even find the key to unlock in themselves. There's so many crazy and unique things that make our brains so keen to all these untold stories in art and elsewhere. It's almost magical."
BPD,filo5bx,t3_f8g7qx,1582506235.0,"Oh my, you literally described this so perfectly. It truly cannot be described and put into words, which is so frustrating. But the way you worded it really hit him for me. It makes so much sense. It's so difficult living with the whirlwind in my head. I've got so much going on in there, but I can't figure any of it out or express any of it. I'm just an entire mess and not knowing exactly what's going on really upsets me."
BPD,fi0uw26,t3_f5twaw,1582045258.0,"This is 100% me. I don't even mean to. It's not a conscious decision on my part, I just say things that come to my mind. It's like I need the words to leave my body or I might combust. But I always feel very embarrassed and ashamed after I do. Especially when I know there's people who are dealing with things, but tend to keep to themselves, while I'm sharing every detail as it comes. I resent the way my brain works."
BPD,fhpr4ci,t3_f4d4bp,1581794018.0,"Happy birthday!! I can completely relate to you. Birthdays are hard, because it feels like those insecurities and sorrows are amplified. It sounds like wherever you are, the day must be over, but if you are able to, maybe you could get out with your boyfriend? So you're not alone. Or heck, take yourself out, treat yourself. Sounds like you stayed home and took care of yourself, which is good. You have a good attitude - tomorrow is a new day. I am sure the right people will come into your life. Just be yourself, cause that person is beautiful. I hope you can find some comfort and happiness in the little things today."
BPD,fhhy2by,t1_fhh5vvj,1581614013.0,This is literally me as well. I can't just be normal and have a good time. I'm constantly over analyzing every small thing that he says or the way he is acting. And then I just start to disassociate and I feel panicked. I ruin everything because of this.
BPD,fhfxms2,t1_fhft0dr,1581553739.0,Oh? I've never heard of that. That sounds interesting. I find myself disassociating a lot in general.
BPD,fhfqilm,t1_fhfoaju,1581548976.0,"I really thought I was the only one... Like, it's really involved. Not just daydreaming about characters living cool lives, but really developed characters in my head and I feel this really strange connection to them. There's a lot of things I do that make me feel like I'm regressing... I think I'm stuck in some undeveloped state of mind."
BPD,fhequtc,t3_f2r6hz,1581528038.0,"Maybe having a little goal for yourself in the morning. Like... Tell yourself, ""I need to get up so I can brush my teeth"". Just something simple. Don't have these big, looming goals for the day. Maybe conquering those small things will help ease your anxiety as you get up and start your day. 

I know this is easier said than done though. There's a lot going on in our heads stopping us from doing things, that for other people, should be easy and normal. I really feel for you."
BPD,fheqi6w,t3_f2p1ek,1581527831.0,"I used to make up characters in my head when I was younger and I would daydream endlessly about them in different scenarios. If they were me right now, what would they do? How would they act? Now, as I'm older, I realize I still do this. I have these idealized characters in my head that I feel like are a part of me, but I can never be. They oddly make me feel comforted, though.... I don't know, I'm strange. And clearly too stuck in my own head."
AskReddit,fhen3nk,t3_f2pe4o,1581525846.0,"In my junior year of high school, I was a cliche depressed, angsty teenager. I had an attitude, because I was lacking attention that I needed in that time of my life. I had quite an attitude with my teachers. My AP English 11 teacher included. At the time, I just hated the class and I didn't like my teacher. I was pretty terrible to him... I lacked respect and didn't put any effort in. After turning a paper in (I wrote an argumentative essay about the innateness of creativity in every human soul) and as he gave it back to me, he said ""I don't think I'm creative at all, and this paper really inspired me."" And it was graded well. It was simple. But this teacher that I had never treated very fairly had approached me to say this. It was very impactful, because I once had a love and passion for writing. But a previous teacher made me feel shit about it, and I just gave up on it. I think about this all the time. I wish I could tell him that I'm sorry for being such an asshole and that his words meant a lot to me."
BPD,fhcy43d,t3_f2is91,1581473297.0,"This. Seriously, this. I work so hard to be okay. The highs are so good. But when something goes wrong and I hit a low, it doesn't matter what I do. I'm trapped in my mind and I can't get out. It truly hurts so much. I feel like I am ruining every thing. I hate myself. Why do I have to be this way."
BPD,fh8k24k,t1_fh8isjw,1581361393.0,"Honestly, do whatever is gonna be healthiest for you. You don't really owe him anything. Just take care of yourself."
BPD,fh8hujk,t1_fh8gnnk,1581360051.0,"You definitely deserve better than that. Do you live with your boyfriend? If you do, maybe try to get away for a bit. Spend some time with those family and friends that love you. If you feel comfortable, it could be really helpful for you to open up to one of these people, just to talk to them about what you've been going through. 

It might even be nice for you to do a solo trip or something. I think in the next month or so I'm going to try to get a cabin somewhere pretty and spend a bit of time by myself. I feel suicidal quite a bit, as well, but I think getting away from the huge feeling of pressure will help me relax and help me get to know myself a bit better. What's more important than your boyfriend and friends treating you right, is you treating you right. The rest will hopefully follow. I know that's cliche... But ya know, it's important for us to find some peace within ourselves.

I very much understand what you're going through. It's very hard. You sound like a strong person, though. I think you can find the best way out of this situation. If it counts for anything if you're ever feeling confused or low, you're always welcome to send me a message. Sometimes it's hard to find people who understand. I wish the absolute best for you."
BPD,fh8eu88,t1_fh8ckpr,1581358238.0,"I really am so sorry that your boyfriend is acting in that way. It sounds like now that he knows about the BPD, he's found a way to use it against you. You are not just a ""textbook case"". And thank God you're not just a ""normie"", either. You are so wonderful and unique just how you are, and that is including your mental health struggles. They help make you who you are, which might sound scary and like a bad thing, but I've found that those of us with those inner struggles are usually the most intuitive, creative, and all-around lovely people. Sometimes others just don't understand us. I don't think your boyfriend does. He may understand, in terms of what a book can tell him, what BPD is, but he clearly knows nothing about who a person with BPD is. He is completely unwilling to help you. Maybe he has a good heart somewhere, but whether he is just frustrated with how your mental health affects you or is perhaps taking some of his own personal issues out on you, it's completely immature and unfair of him.

I cannot be the one to say you need to leave him. But I believe you need to be supported by people who love you and care for you. Even in the bad times, not just the good times.

Do you have any family or friends who you can go to for support during this?"
relationships,fh8aqqs,t3_f1qd9b,1581355736.0,"Wow. A lot of people on here are jumping to conclusions and generally being very negative. You can't just make assumptions about OPs girlfriend based on what he has said in this post. Some of the suggestions people are making could in fact be true, but we don't know that. I think the first step before just saying ""break up"" is to take a step back and have a conversation. Communication is the most important thing in a relationship. OP, it sounds like you don't fully understand why she doesn't want to have sex suddenly. She needs to be very honest with you and tell you what's going on. Maybe she is getting pressure from somewhere and someone else in her life and she feels guilty and thinks that it's only right for her to remain celibate until marriage. That's my first thought. There is something holding her back. It may be hard, but it's really important that you have a really open and honest conversation."
BPD,fh89rsj,t3_f1p5z6,1581355139.0,"Obviously I don't know the whole story, but the way your boyfriend is treating you because of your mood changes is completely not okay. Especially since he knows that you struggle with BPD. This isn't something we can turn on and off. It's hard to control. Most of the time, for me anyway, I am putting on a brave face, so what people are seeing is only about 10% of what I am actually feeling. I can go weeks ""being"" very BPD and I can go weeks doing very well managing symptoms as they come. My boyfriend is very supportive. He recognizes my mood swings, which are very intense and drastic. He never accuses me of anything though and does not get upset about it.

You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you along with your disorder. Not in spite of it.

I'm so sorry you're experiencing this OP. I've been toying with the idea almost every day of getting up and leaving without telling anyone. Life can be so hard to handle. It can be hard to even find room to breathe. Please don't put up with people treating you like shit. Like I said, I only know what you've said here. Maybe there is a talk that you two can have... Maybe he is willing to figure out a way to be more supportive? You deserve love and support."
BPD,fh1owl4,t1_fh1osgd,1581219978.0,Way too much. I don't even know how to explain. It's like everything inside of my brain and my body hurts. I feel like I can't get away.

relationships,fbu82pv,t3_eehksf,1577109565.0,"Take some time away from each other. In any relationship, it's important for each person to have some space, and sometimes that might mean for a prolonged amount of time. It will give both of you time to focus on yourselves (and your careers, since you're new professionals) and he will be able to properly think about things. It will add some perspective, and will hopefully help him figure out how he feels."
