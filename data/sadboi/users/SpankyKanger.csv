reddeadredemption2,fcnpzlp,t1_fcnhdpn,1577816250.0,"Yeah same here. I believe this game suffers from the vocal minority, where some people suffered with really bad bugs but I don't know anybody IRL who had any at all. I wish others wouldn't have had the issues because then maybe they would've made more games with those parkour and combat mechanics which were the best in the series IMO. I'd take Unity-esque games over what we got with O and Od hands down."
