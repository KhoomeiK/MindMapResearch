I don't hate American people in general, but I'm totally against your government. Same thing  China and Russia.

Trump has systematically making the worst decisions imaginable with everything he does (specially covid and climate change) and China is turning into Orwellian surveillance state and is having literally concentration camps. 

If my country had someone like Trump or Xinnie the Pooh, I would be probably making molotovs already.
