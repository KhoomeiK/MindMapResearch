For whatever reason it doesn't sit well with me that OP knew that her nephew wasn't eating anything the entire day and virtually did nothing about it. She knew he wasn't eating what she was making and then just continued on with her day? Even though she knew he hadn't eaten all day? Idk that is just a big red flag to me. It's not an ideal situation - obviously the kid's mom needs to learn to say no to her son and teach him some manners but again, it could have been handled by OP much differently."
AmItheAsshole,fqzzgow,t1_fqzyn91,1589779391.0,"It's more of 8 hours + in this situation though - the kid didn't have breakfast which means he hadn't eaten since the previous night. *That* is the context we're dealing with rather than the time between lunch and dinner, where 2 meals have already been eaten in the day. Also you know full well that nobody feels hunger while sleeping - it usually doesn't kick in until you wake up. 

I've also been fasting this month and I have been skipping the early morning breakfast because I just don't want to get up at 4 am to eat. This means that my last meal was at night and that I can't eat until evening - which is fine, I signed up for this. The reason I bring this up is that without a breakfast (which again, this kid didn't have) the rest of the day is brutal. The time between 8am-4pm where my last meal was the night before, is not a great time - and that is coming from an adult. It'd be worse for a kid. 

I really don't think it would have killed OP to make some nuggets just to make sure the kid was fed and then have a chat with the mom later. It would not even be a stretch to tell his mother that unless his spoiled behaviour changes, he can't stay at her place. But the mom is not in the wrong for being upset that her child hadn't had anything to eat the entire day."

It's not your fault the kid is a picky eater and obviously his behaviour is being enabled by his mother. But, you are the adult here. I don't understand how you had a child in your care and you didn't make sure that they ate.  I cannot fathom as to why you thought that would be okay. Yes, you made food but you were aware that he wasn't eating it and that he hadn't eaten all day and you STILL did nothing. You were responsible for him and under YOUR supervision he didn't eat. That is unacceptable. 

Also, it's not your job to parent him. Give the kid some chicken nuggets so you're not enabling him to starve and have his mother deal with the consequences of his actions in the future.

EDIT: If my little brother was in the care of a trusted adult and didn't eat, I would be furious. I can see exactly why his mother was upset.

EDIT: Hey instead of downvoting maybe you should all go ahead and explain exactly why it's ok to let a kid in your care not eat anything for 8 hours.

EDIT: So this is just in response to the comments, which are repetitive so I'll address them all here! 

1) There is difference between providing food, a basic need and parenting. If a mom is verbally abusive (not that OP is, this is just an example) but provides food and shelter for her kid, does that count as parenting? No. Parenting also refers to building character and raising your kids right. OP's role is not the parent - it is up to the kid's mother to raise him right, not her. There was no need for her to prove a point (although, a necessary one) at the expense of food. 

2) Eight hours without food *is* insane. OP says that the Kid didn't have breakfast OR lunch, which means he didn't eat all day. As an adult who is currently fasting for the month of Ramadan, eight hours without food is intense and at that point your body already starts to slow down. If OP refused something like TV time or video games - that's fine. A kid can live without those things. But a kid needs food to survive and to function. I don't care how bratty he is, leaving a kid hungry for eight hours is wildly unacceptable and borderline neglect. 

3) The Kid is a brat, yes. He should have sucked it up and ate what was provided as most kids do. But he didn't and OP kind of just let the Kid not eat for eight hours straight. OP should have been more concerned that the Kid hadn't eaten all day and did whatever necessary to make him eat. Period. She then had the option to pull the Kid's mom aside and let her know what happened, and that if he continues this behaviour again he can no longer stay at her place. 

There was a much, much better and quite frankly, mature way of handling this as opposed to just turning a blind eye to the fact that he hadn't eaten all day. You are the adult and it is wildly irresponsible to let a kid under your watch not eat all day. The kid's a brat, YTA and the mom is in the right to be furious at you. God knows I would be."

You have no obligation to have this girl in your life, nor your father. It's not cool that she's harassing you this way and quite frankly, she absolutely should know better.

That being said, you handled this just as immaturely. There was no need for a public confrontation when you could have discussed this privately. Plus, the language that was used was out of line as well and overall just unpleasant - I mean, you have every right to go off in private, but publicly may not be the way to go."

For a little context here, I speak both French and English fluently, and I grew up in an Urdu speaking household. Growing up, and even now, my parents would \*constantly\* implore me to speak to them in Urdu. Even when they would ask me questions in Urdu, I responded in English every time. Looking back on it now, I understand their frustration - they just wanted their culture to live in their daughter who grew up in a land foreign to them. Nonetheless, my parents have never, ever, ever, threatened to kick me out if I didn't speak Urdu. I can't even imagine it. 

I get the importance of encouraging your children to speak their native tongue at home - it holds a distinct cultural purpose. However, it does not warrant threats, especially when we are in the middle of pandemic and her boyfriend, who does not speak any French is staying with you."

My brother is Autistic, and the general consensus is that I will be taking care of him when my parents are unable to. However, they also understand that this may be limited, as I have my own life to live so they're open to the option of nursing home. 

I think it's wrong for your parents to assume that you will be taking care of your brother when they cannot - that is unrealistic and quite frankly, I'd understand why you would not want to do that. It would be detrimental to your progression as an adult, especially when it comes to starting a family. 

However, your comments which were  ""The day after you die, I'm sending Drew to a nursing home and I'll never visit him again"", were unnecessarily cruel. You very much should have had this conversation much earlier, but even then you should have come up with a compromise. Something along the lines of ""I'll have to send him to a nursing home, for the betterment of my family, but I will visit him regularly so he has family around"". I don't think that's unreasonable at all, and I'm sure your parents will come around to this suggestion as well."

I have to say, I am a bit conflicted. My brother also has severe autism, but unlike you I have a heart and actually give a shit about him.

However, you are an asshole for not caring for your brother. Fuck that shit. My brother is also severely autistic, and can barely get a single sentence out. But I love him regardless.

I always do it during periods of high stress- when I get a bad grade or have an exam coming up- things like that. I can't say for sure what was going on in my brain when I decided ""hey, let's try making myself throw up"" but I did it once and I've been hooked for months. 

Body image has never been a huge part of it for me. Because of that, I've felt that it can't be an actual eating disorder."
