Petioles,fqq4iwx,t3_gk7nlk,1589559265.0,"There is no one answer, I am on the same boat as you. I managed to go an entire week without smoking recently even tho it was in my house. that was huge for me. My husband is the kind of person who can manage his use and only smoke at night or not smoke at all if he‚Äôs not feeling it. I truly think it depends on your relationship to weed in the first place. It also depends on how much you actually want to change your habits. You say it makes you feel like yourself and you are able to be more creative and get through boring tasks. It‚Äôs your little helper to get through the day (same here) but then the side affects make you self conscious of your use. If there weren‚Äôt negative side affects like memory loss, increased tolerance, lower lung performance, and overeating I would smoke all day and not feel guilty at all. 

My husband sees smoking as a way to unwind at the end of a hard day when he just wants to bliss out. He used to smoke as soon as he woke up and blazed all day. There is hope but not for all of us. We first have to truly want to change our habits and pinpoint why we use so much in the first place. I think there is hope for you (and me) but not as you currently are. But in the meantime, try not to be too hard on yourself and taking baby steps to your goals is better than setting yourself up for failure and back sliding with your progress."

Im very codependent and am also a big introvert. I honestly never realized what a huge turn off this behavior is until recently and I‚Äôm trying so hard to keep it in check. I have been with my husband for 5 years and unfortunately comfort with someone makes my awareness drop even more to the point where I end up being an asshole sometimes because I‚Äôm too comfortable to remember to keep my emotions in check I guess. I can tell you are trying to see it from his side, which shows you really care. What helps me is when my husband reminds me that his anger or frustration does not have to be shared with me. Like, just because he‚Äôs pissed and I‚Äôm in the same room, that doesn‚Äôt mean he is pissed at me. I realized this was a huge symptom of codependency. I grew up around a bipolar father who was truly unpredictable and a mother who over compensated for a lack of affection by doting on my brother and I until we were useless little blobs. I can‚Äôt expect my husband to hold my hand through both my bad moods and his, but it helps when he reminds me that whatever he‚Äôs upset about has nothing to do with me and me making it about me makes him feel invalidated. Again, never my intention but I see how I make him feel like that and it kills me. Taking criticism about a behavior that feels like such an ingrained part of your personality is difficult because it feels like an attack on ones personality.

For reference we do not have kids yet but it‚Äôs something we both want and the cavewoman in me is just dying to mix our genetics together.

Do we fight like cats and dogs? Sometimes. Do we get in arguments about petty shit? Sometimes.

Not sure if some would look at my relationship and want it for themselves (I am rather undisciplined and go inward instead of talking about issues, he is extremely assertive and has deep seated anger problems and we both have trauma from previous relationships) but it‚Äôs my life and we have accomplished so much together as a team. The biggest lesson marriage has taught me is that humans are imperfect and will always make mistakes but you have to always chose love. We disappoint each other once and awhile, healthy relationships don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù . It‚Äôs about choosing every day that you want to be with this person. You chose this person as your partner and you must honor that. Or don‚Äôt and move along if that‚Äôs not what you want. We all have choices.

You may not feel 100% compatible with your partner all the time. You may have horrible arguments that make you wonder if you were truly meant to work out.

To get the full benefits of THC, of which there are many, regulation is so important.

Petioles,fm23knl,t3_fsdohr,1585689979.0,"So this may be counter productive since you say you view your smoking as unhealthy, but I would recommend switching to CBD flower. Get yourself some CBD flower and smoke on that when you‚Äôre feeling an urge m. Going cold turkey can be intense and lead to such bad insomnia that it makes you crack. At least, that‚Äôs what happened to me often when I tried to take a break. I now mix CBD flower and normal weed together when I smoke."
Petioles,fluh1z7,t3_fr6scm,1585502448.0,"Is it possible? Of course! But a lot of people do find themselves too tempted to smoke if weed is around. There are a lot of different reasons we smoke and those of us who self medicate may find weed a detriment to our physical and mental health after masking what our actual issues are. I‚Äôm guilty of that for sure. 

I myself am actively cutting back by smoking more CBD flower (hemp, not sativa) and forcing my sober brain to remember that getting high all day every day does NOT feel good. I have a habit (smoking daily in and off for a decade) and I do want to cut back. But I‚Äôve tried and tired for years and failed. Why? Because I never truly committed to it 100% and made the excuse that because it‚Äôs around (my husband also smokes) I can‚Äôt control myself. 

But I also want to be able to enjoy weed and be able to have it around my house. The only way I can do that is if I try really hard to stay committed and hold myself accountable. So I have to keep having self control and remembering why I want to smoke less. We all make our own realities and you are capable of making yours look how you want it. But only you know what that looks like.

Good luck! You‚Äôre not alone."
Unemployment,flse5ka,t3_fqvf0r,1585440110.0,I‚Äôm upvoting this because I am in almost the same situation. I work two part time jobs. I was about to start a new job but the state of emergency was declared right before my first day and my new job closed. I already filed for unemployment for my other part time job but I have no idea how I‚Äôm supposed to file a claim for two part time jobs.
Anxiety,fkvbxvv,t3_fkq88w,1584566111.0,"Dude welcome to the last 4 days of my life. My husband and I have been freaked out for weeks while our friends and family have been so cavalier. This was inevitable. I don‚Äôt think most of us really realize what is about to happen.... not only the loss of life but the absolute gutting of our capitalist system. This may well be our ‚ÄúFall of Rome‚Äù but we just have no way to tell yet.

The world is going to look very different in a few months. Even just a few days. Stay well and know that we will pull through this together."
Petioles,fjb8q4t,t3_fbsbxa,1583188734.0,"I feel you on the reliance issue. I have a lot of trouble sticking to my guns on the weekends. At 9 am while making coffee it‚Äôs always like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the harm in one small puff?‚Äù And then it‚Äôs all downhill from there unless I leave the house and don‚Äôt smoke again until much later when I come home. I find reading posts on this sub and also r/leaves helps motivate me but also puts my own use in perspective. It makes me realize that my use, like yours, is not so heavy that regulating and reducing is going to be a huge uncomfortable me challenge. I‚Äôm not stoned all day every day or spending hundreds of dollars a month on it, it‚Äôs my own impulse control I need to work on. Best of luck to you :)"
Petioles,fjb80y9,t1_fjalq0o,1583188331.0,"I tried it but got frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt seem to get it to register when I only smoke like two hits of the one hitter or something. And I don‚Äôt want the app to think I smokes more than I do, which is a stupid reason lol. Maybe I was using it wrong?"
Petioles,fjakvb4,t1_fjajpux,1583175470.0,Thank you! I‚Äôm going to need all the luck I can get üò¨
Petioles,fjakrnm,t3_fbsbxa,1583175414.0,I am about to try some hemp flower because I too love weed and I realized part of what I love is the ritual of smoking. Hemp gives you the CBD boost of a sativa so I plan to mix it with actual weed because i still like the THC buzz. My goal is to cut my use in half (I smoke about 1/8 every two weeks at the most). Good luck!!
Petioles,fjajcky,t3_fc356c,1583174666.0,"Hi there, I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôre moderating your use so well! I‚Äôm actually planning to order some hemp flower today to help me with moderate and reduce my use. With some breaks here and there, I‚Äôve been smoking basically every day for almost a decade, which is slightly terrifying. I am about to turn 31 and a great fear of mine is losing short term memory. That is the most unpleasant side affect for me, even more so than overeating it being a little foggy. I am very productive despite being a ‚Äústoner‚Äù and have hobbies I indulge in and I‚Äôm pretty active physically. My worries come from my trouble self regulating, and I hyper focus on this as I feel it is a huge negative. The more I hyper focus, the worse I feel when I over indulge, which often happens on a chill weekend. My husband smokes also but with no compulsion issues and it helps him with stress so I don‚Äôt want to not have any in the house just because I have self control issues. I long for the day when I can come home from work and truly not want to smoke. I just love weed so much. I only drink socially and don‚Äôt use any other drugs so it‚Äôs truly my one vice. I know I don‚Äôt need to smoke, but I really feel like I benefit from a lot of the effects, particularly the perspective shift it helps me achieve and the calming effects coupled with self reflection. High me has saved sober me from embarrassing both of us numerous times. 

Anyway, I smoke about 1/8 every 2-3 weeks. I would LOVE to lower that number to 1/8 once per month at the very most. Your post is inspiring me to keep at my goal of self regulating my use and cutting down my THC intake. Keep it up!! We got this :)"
FriendshipAdvice,fix845j,t1_fivql6s,1582814892.0,"Wow, what a bitch! Again I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this. I would be crushed if my own closest friend of 20 years did this to me. Take care of yourself and keep nurturing the positive relationships in your life :) This woman has proven she‚Äôs not work the energy."
FriendshipAdvice,fivhk2a,t3_f9xkl2,1582760421.0,"I think your friend is definitely in the wrong here. She totally mean girled you and you have every right to be hurt and offended. Do you feel comfortable telling this friend how this made you feel?

It drives me crazy how entitled some brides (and grooms) act. I eloped myself because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with any of this shit and we also weren‚Äôt trying to spend a bunch of money we didn‚Äôt have on a party we never really wanted. Getting married is actually super easy, no one deserves a medal or a big fancy slew of parties for doing it. If you can afford it, great, but I can‚Äôt imagine wanting my parents or whoever to spend $15-30k on a 6 hour affair. And no one deserves to feel badly for not having the means to attend these lavish things. One of my friends went into some short term credit card debt just to go to her friend‚Äôs bachelorette in New Orleans. 

Sounds like this friend values material bullshit over something as irreplaceable as a long term close friendship. Her priorities are fucked. I am SO sorry this happened to you. If this action fits in with her typical behavior, for your own well being, it may be a good idea to distance yourself from her. Taking care of yourself is #1 and no one deserves to be made to feel this way by a close friend."
lonely,fiq9yl0,t3_f98l6e,1582639284.0,"üíï we sound very similar. When I don‚Äôt have a good hangout for a few weeks, I start getting in my head and feeling like the most unlikeable person. I‚Äôm searching for ways to sustain that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù I get from fun social interactions. I have a long term weed habit I‚Äôm trying to get under some control so I can process my emotions better.

I suggest talking to your doctor about your fatigue. Maybe there is something they can do to help. It‚Äôs good that you were diagnosed and know that your thyroid is under active. Get some rest! You reaching out for help and being able to articulate how you feel so well is leading me to think you‚Äôre really not a boring person at all. I‚Äôm new to Reddit after lurking on it anonymously for years and I‚Äôm really loving how supportive users are to total strangers. I‚Äôm happy to be able to share my experience if it helps someone even just a tiny bit."
lonely,fiq4cu5,t1_fiq3kv5,1582634699.0,"So you‚Äôre not a boring person, you are an exhausted person! Do you think there is anything medical that could be causing that? Like a thyroid problem? 
I feel you with the therapy issue, I was in the same boat for awhile. Last year after my husband and i kept fighting about the same things over and over again, I pushed myself really hard to find a new therapist after not seeing one in like 4 years. I am so happy I found the woman I see now, she‚Äôs been amazing. But I felt like I had given up hope of connecting with anyone. I have a hard time connecting with people sometimes but I think a lot of that is from stress and anxiety. It‚Äôs awesome that your BF gets it and loves you despite you feeling that you are boring. And one friend is so much better than nothing. 
Being tired all the time makes everything so hard and daunting. I hope you are able to find a way to give yourself the energy boost you need to start working on the things you want to improve. I am a low energy person and finding motivation when you‚Äôre tired is HARD."
lonely,fiq2s6x,t3_f98l6e,1582633183.0,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling so low! I feel like this often but for me personally, I deal with low confidence and self loathing and don‚Äôt have a wide social circle of friends as I‚Äôm a shy and introverted person. But I want to ask you, are you actually a boring person? With no passions, hobbies, interests at all? Depression tricks us into feeling all sorts of terrible ways. It makes our own Brian‚Äôs lie to us. I woke up this morning feeling super sad because of an ongoing interaction with a friend who I guess I have more time and compassion for than she has for me. I like her a lot but she has repeatedly made me feel so unwanted and shitty without even trying. She has no idea that she‚Äôs made me cry multiple times. But a lot of that is my own sad expectations not being met. She tells me she misses me and wants to hangout but then the next day when she‚Äôs supposed to let me know what she‚Äôs up to so we can meet, I don‚Äôt hear from her. She did it to me Sunday when we had something important to do and it kills me. Did I not cross her mind at all? Are all of her other friends so interesting and fun that I just look like the wettest blanket in the entire city? She has a wide group of friends and is a very ‚Äúpopular‚Äù adult. I‚Äôm not. So I often feel boring and not good enough and it kills me. 
You are not alone. I know deep down that I am not a boring person and I bet you aren‚Äôt either. It sounds like you could use some good self care and positivity. I wonder if there is anything you could do to help increase your engagement with the world and lift you out of this depression. And I agree that saying shit like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll go out and join a club, try more‚Äù is NOT helpful. I‚Äôm not sure if you are in therapy already, but talk therapy has helped me a lot personally.

Edit; I know you‚Äôre not asking us to ‚Äúfix‚Äù you or give you lots of advice. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it all before. Just sharing what I find helpful when I feel the way you feel (which is often)."
Anxiety,fip8djk,t3_f9193i,1582600310.0,"I just put in my notice last week after nearly 3 years on the job. That's the longest this 30 year old has ever stayed in one place. I will miss many aspects of the place and I truly wish I had a thicker skin and didn't internalize so much stress so I could've maybe stayed longer. But I think my job would be difficult for anyone, especially since it should really be at least 2 if not 3 jobs if I weren't just doing it all begrudging. And to my serious detriment.

I had an email drafted giving my notice so that my bosses weren't blind sided. I honestly expected them to give me the ""what the fuck"" treatment too when I gave notice. My husband took a look at it and cut out SO much personal stuff I had written about how I was feeling and all the extra stress the job brought into my life. I have a laundry list of reasons I should've left that job 6 months ago. Hubs said it was too personal and even though I have a fairly casual relationship with my bosses, he suggested I not give them all these feelings in writing. So I took his advice and edited the email down and sent it. Turns out, my bosses could tell for a couple months I was unhappy and were not surprised by my notice, although sad to see me go. I so wanted to tell them just how miserable the job made me sometimes. How I felt lonely and isolated until someone wanted something from me. How I managed a new aspect of the business for an entire year because no one else would do it and that was what really broke me.  How I felt left to my own devices until they disagreed with an action I took most likely under stress when no one else was available to advise me. I honestly wish I could say all this to them! But for my situation, seems like it was unspoken. They knew, I didn't need to rub it in but goddammit I really wanted to.

Please be kind to yourself. What happened today happened and now no one has any doubt why you are leaving and perhaps they can take steps to make positive changes so your replacement doesn't end up feeling the same way. Try to focus on what's next for you and all the positives. And the job is sad to see you go, while that's a bummer for them it shows they value you as a part of the team. It was the job that wasn't a good fit for YOU, not the other way around."
