InSickness,fq5ta8s,t3_ggwjqk,1589116867.0,"Hiya I'm in a similar boat, actually are situations are almost identical. We had sex once last year and haven't since. It's just too painful for him. Our sex life used to be very active before his chronic pain got worse. I suppress my feelings now too, and don't bother initiating anything. I miss it too, and it's very hard. All I can say to you is: keep communicating and talking to him about how you feel... you may be able to find workarounds (can you masturbate, get sex toys etc). Is there another outlet for you to fulfil those desires? Like your husband, mine brought up the possibility of an open marriage but I refused and have never really been into the idea myself so I try to find ways of fulfilling my own needs with toys etc, and talking to him about it if I need to. Just hearing that he misses it too, and that he wishes he wasn't in pain, can help... I totally understand the strain and if you ever want to DM me for an outlet you're welcome to."

There was so much more they could have done, but I feel they fell into a lot of tropes and stereotypes here. it felt very generic. If we look at Dark Room, it pales in comparison. There were no omg moments for me, no massive twists, no high stakes."
lifeisstrange,ey5sfrt,t1_exrhnev,1566839262.0,"I enjoyed Episode 1 and 2, but this episode was a massive disappointment. I agree with you completely, and couldn't have worded it better myself (in fact, I came here to see if any fans of the game agreed). I found the reverend to be very two-dimensional. Another problem I'm having is that because they're on the road, they're introducing characters randomly that serve no narrative purpose and aren't heard from again (Lyla, Captain Spirit, the journalist guy, the truck dude, some of the kids from Ep 3). Because they're spreading themselves out across all these characters, the main ones feel underdeveloped. 

I know it's unfair to compare, but if we think back to LiS 1, we had all the crazy Jefferson shit going down, massive plot twists... compared to a generic ""evil"" reverend who punishes homosexuals and brainwashes kids. It was all a bit predictable and underwhelming. I just feel like religious cults have been overdone, and there was so much potential to do something else based on Ep 3. 

I didn't even like the hospital segment! I expected it'd be harder to escape, I expected more interaction. We didn't even get to be involved when Sean was hot-wiring the car, e.g. by pressing buttons. And during the final scene with the reverend there were so many times I wanted to be given dialogue choices, but wasn't."
