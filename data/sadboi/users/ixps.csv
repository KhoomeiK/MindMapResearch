Just looking over your clothing.html.php page, starting at line 74 to 90, you have a large PHP block that echos a lot of HTML. Without having a live demo to look at, I'm guessing this is at least part of the issue. You can actually close the PHP, write the HTML like normal, and then have a new PHP tag afterward to close the loop. E.g:

    <?php
      while ($row = mysqli_fetch_row($result)) {
      /* Your PHP stuff */
    ?> <!-- close the PHP tag -->
    
    <!-- Your HTML stuff -->

Others mentioned that you need to be careful with prepared statements, and that's the truth. The problem with allowing a user to enter variable information is that they can input their own SQL (aka SQL injection) and manipulate your database in ways you didn't expect, like writing a statement to grant user rights or deleting a row or table.

Ways to protect your DB from it is to limit how your user can input their data and scrub the variable after it leaves the user to be processed by the server... like having the PHP ensure that the value is an integer and only an integer, or forcing strings to be a specific length and format, and when its not to either set it to a default variable or give the user an error message.
