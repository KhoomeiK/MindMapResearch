13ReasonsWhy,etwoo88,t3_cds5ch,1563279463.0,"TW graphic suicide description. Self harm.

In some ways I think the scene should've been MORE graphic, when I watched it I fell to pieces and cried my eyes out, all I could think of was my best friend finding me like that or me finding her like that, my heart shattered when her mum found her. But as I said, I think it should've been more graphic because suicide is even uglier and harder to do than what they show, there are usually hesitation marks all over the wrists before someone manages to do it, and they often cut through their tendons as well, and it hurts so much. As an ex self harmer and suicide ""survivor"" I can say that from my own experiences trying to kill yourself can be absolutely hideous, the thoughts alone ""I don't want XYZ to hurt because of me, but I can't keep living, but maybe I should try to hold on for another day?"". I've never seen suicide depicted so well in the media and taking out the scene makes the suicide seem glorified. I think there should be more trigger warnings in place, I can't remember if there's one right before the scene or not, I feel there should be because it brings you back in to the real world for a minute.
I feel the episode is far more dangerous now and has just lost its point and gravity."
