bipolar2,fmpdcj8,t3_fwjs9g,1586278815.0,Thank you for this. Everyone around me keeps talking about all the organizing they are doing and cleaning they caught up on. I am just trying to not slip into a brutal depression. Most of my routine is destroyed and I am having to rewire my brain to cope...
bipolar2,fkiiead,t3_fijabc,1584220730.0,"No matter how productive I truly am, my anxiety will tell me I am not."
Paladins,fk0usw9,t1_fk0byd4,1583766629.0,Nintendo wasn't sure and I sent a support ticket to Paladins too. We will see what Paladins support says. Thank you for looking.
Paladins,fk0upu0,t1_fjzs95u,1583766576.0,I hadn't tried restarting my router. I will give that a shot.
Paladins,fjzjhu4,t1_fjz9uhf,1583721200.0,I tried that and it affects both my switch and sons switch lite.
Amd,fi5dj55,t1_fi49dkn,1582160671.0,Exactly and that's what I did with my last card but nothing is showing in my and rewards account üôÅ.
Amd,fi49uty,t1_fi47mni,1582136879.0,I have but it's been  week and still no code on the and rewards site. I also got an email from and saying I needed to go through the retailer to get the game code which doesn't sound right.
Amd,fh4fvmt,t1_fh2f65p,1581278246.0,What about the gigabyte model with the three fans?
Amd,fh4bsp7,t1_fh3z8it,1581277175.0,That is good to know. I will keep doing a little research before I buy but I will probably go Newegg instead of Amazon since you get some stuff there with your purchase.
Amd,fh3g4r1,t1_fh2f65p,1581268645.0,"When you say good, what do you mean? It seemed like a lot of the 5700s are similar in performance. Are you referring to cooling, power, and other stuffs? I really want to get something I can be happy with for a couple years."
Amd,fh3fu9k,t1_fh25hve,1581268554.0,"Have you flashed your bios to the XT bios? Also, what driver issues?"
Amd,fh1ofh0,t1_fh1jz1p,1581219624.0,I will have to look into that. I didn't think about undervolting.
Amd,fh1oe1z,t1_fh1hmiz,1581219594.0,Is there something else you would recommend? This seems like quite a deal in comparison to the 5700 XT prices.
bipolar,fcxspck,t1_fcxsfps,1578069942.0,"Yeah, winter and holidays usually beat me up, but I am always my own worst enemy. I over analyze my depression and spend too much time trying to solve it. This case seems to be worse then normal. Thank you for the kind words."
heroesofthestorm,f7dejy8,t1_f778m9o,1573614695.0,"I really appreciate your response. I am glad to hear that people haven't forgot about what Blizzard did. 

Don't get me wrong, the game is still probably amazing and the devs see to be doing their best. I think I just want to look over the fence and see 2017 and 2018 again. I try a game or two and see where it goes."
heroesofthestorm,f76k5zc,t1_f76ibjd,1573428988.0,"Yeah, I basically stopped playing Blizz games after the cut of HGC. Seems like things haven't changed or are now worse. It's too bad since Blizzard seemed to be a player focus company until they got consumed. I don't think I have a lot of interest investing myself again. Just curious if things changed."
MagicArena,f5j710b,t3_do0ki1,1572222146.0,I have also had a really hard time with this set in draft and not lucky enough to draft any bombs. It seems like you really need a bomb or two or crazy mill to win.
MagicArena,f4b766i,t1_f4b2yrn,1571507862.0,Kk. What is the discord?
MagicArena,f30x5yn,t1_f30buw5,1570564018.0,When is ranked draft available?
MagicArena,f1lcrlh,t1_f1lbtgn,1569551352.0,Oh word! I haven't played this much attention to a release on arena. Thanks for the heads up.
magicTCG,ez52l11,t1_ez4kcxp,1567695232.0,"I love the format too, but the decks are a little boring. Played about 5 games with each deck and I'm good until the release. I just want to make my own awesome decks. This at least gives me a good on what I want to build though!"
magicTCG,eywnh1z,t3_cz5fkh,1567533535.0,Is this something we all can watch or just those who received an invitation?
GodsUnchained,exewxno,t1_exeaou5,1566227343.0,"Yeah, it definitely feels like a Hearthstone clone. Not sure how much I can get into it, but might stick around for a bit. I have already found some issues I would like to submit. I am going to have to send something out to the devs."
GodsUnchained,exe2m6p,t1_exe1a6w,1566195593.0,What do you mean by it has a lock on it?
GodsUnchained,exe0ifz,t1_exdxcse,1566193142.0," I left Hearthstone and Faeria because of the poor monetization. They were both cool early on and changed. Got back into a magic a little, but nothing serious. What do you like about the gameplay so far?"
magicTCG,ex742yu,t1_ex6146k,1566055705.0,Agreed üòÅ
magicTCG,ex3mexh,t1_ex305ij,1565987887.0,"Right now I am playing Arena. It is surprising how many cards you get for just playing the game. I feel pretty caught up on rules for the most part. The biggest thing I worry about is that the meta is dominated by one or two decks and everything else isn't viable. I will probably not have money to play older formats, but I could see myself digging into Arena for awhile as its better for my lifestyle (young kids). I am teaching my son magic, but still a ways off until him and I can go to FNM.

So, I could see myself maybe getting into standard, but looking to see if the meta is healthy first. I do LOVE draft though. Not sure what it is, but open packs and picking cards to create a deck is just the best."
magicTCG,ewtlazc,t1_ewtiw8m,1565747854.0,Oh cool! I have been watching their stuff. Time for another video!
magicTCG,ewtl7pu,t1_ewtj5kr,1565747792.0,"What about the block was so bad? I just didn't find it very fun, but I am getting back in and impressed with everything. The story arc over the past several years, fun mechanics, and magic arena is pretty fun too. The new set looks pretty exciting too. Unlike the whole fairly tale theme. Seems like a good time to jump back in."
magicTCG,ewordpx,t1_ewkvj95,1565624936.0,This seems like a good time to jump into magic! A fresh start seems like exciting...or did I miss out on everything important?
magicTCG,ewor77g,t1_ewld25c,1565624820.0,Are the novels good?
magicTCG,ewkthih,t1_ewkqg2l,1565494138.0,It seems like this will be a detour right? Doesn't seem related to the previous arc.
MagicArena,ewftf1j,t1_ewczzwm,1565367193.0,Is there a time when they do a live draft on arena?
MagicArena,ewd00us,t1_ewczz0v,1565292965.0,Cool! Super excited.
MagicArena,ewczfp2,t1_ewctofm,1565292676.0,Thank you all for the clarification! I am looking forward to my first draft. Does this mean I can win a game and come back later?
Steam_Link,euvrs0h,t1_eum7b8j,1564064785.0,I will try that. Thanks for the heads up.
CherokeeXJ,eu8am24,t1_eu84g0e,1563553237.0,The engine seems to run rock solid with no strange emissions. I am first going to try tstat and radiator cap. I am also going to double check what the coolant and tranny oil for anything unusual.
CherokeeXJ,eu843r1,t1_eu7je8v,1563549285.0,That and wouldnt there be smoke coming from the exhaust?
CherokeeXJ,eu6uddd,t1_eu58z11,1563509236.0,Would I start to lose coolant if the head is cracked?
CherokeeXJ,eu6ubgr,t1_eu5rsa4,1563509196.0,It doesn't seem to loose any coolant.
CherokeeXJ,eu6u8t8,t1_eu5vzms,1563509142.0,I will check that out.
CherokeeXJ,eu6u2nr,t1_eu63ftv,1563509016.0,The coolant doesn't leak and drives great. I am definitely replacing the thermostat and radiator cap since its cheap and easy.
bipolar,et51pv8,t3_c9vf6i,1562462194.0,This is really annoying because this happens to me every damn time.
DivinityOriginalSin,es7jg3k,t3_c67le7,1561672173.0,Done and done.
Steam_Link,eqs1rjt,t1_eqrhbb6,1560274780.0,No. It was hit or miss. Pretty weird how it would work and then suddenly wouldn't üò´
bipolar,eqfnhfh,t1_eqc1cuy,1560023568.0,This is what I usually say.
bipolar,eqfk9po,t3_byb62t,1560022155.0,"I have been suffering from bipolar since I was a kid. Everyone thought I was just hyper active. I was the freak out kid. Then it was ADD, then it was blamed in my crappy family life. Then I just thought I was stupid. Went to a bunch of therapists and none of them caught it until my primary care doctor had me take a test and noticed my swings. Finally, after like 15 years I am finally on medication and it works. Go to a different doctor and take a test."
bipolar,eqfjn9g,t3_by7ufo,1560021876.0,"I was just thinking about this yesterday. I am noticing that my mania is subsiding and I am entering a depression. I feel so tired, I can't think, and I don't want to do anything. I sometimes forget how difficult it is being bipolar while my mania is rolling. Then it hits and I am like I wonder what it's like to not have a mental illness."
faeria,epqamap,t1_epno9q1,1559402572.0,"Definitely keep going! I left hearthstone for faeria and faeria has been a ton of fun. I haven't had as much time to play for awhile, but this game deserves to keep moving forward. Great work! Is this going to be a regular expansion or something different?"
bipolar,epqa53f,t1_epozdz3,1559402342.0,"Wellbutrin was quite surprising and improved my libido. I have heard the opposite more often, but a pleased customer here."
Games,epq9m9q,t1_eppvixm,1559402078.0,"I would love split screen. I use to play this game split screen almost every time I played. I realize that we might end up playing controllers vs keyboard, but still...the nostalgia and fun for my friends who don't own gaming computers."
heroesofthestorm,eovbwqu,t1_eor1ecu,1558892124.0,"Well if it was a subscription, then I would have dropped it too. I wonder though if a subscription model would do something for mobas. With all of the other free to play mobas, that probably wouldn't work."
heroesofthestorm,eovbnxo,t1_eoreokq,1558891976.0,I am impressed with what the team has done and it seems like people are trying to keep the pro scene going which speaks volumes.
heroesofthestorm,eovbjnn,t1_eos169f,1558891920.0,"Well after almost 4 years, my wife might consider it a relationship üòâ. I work in development as a product manager so it hits home to me."
ShouldIbuythisgame,eovbf17,t1_eov8sa6,1558891861.0,"If anything give it a try, but is there a 4 pack? This game is a great lan party or coop game."
ShouldIbuythisgame,eov37nt,t3_bt4aca,1558887691.0,Isn't it free for the weekend?
heroesofthestorm,eoqzrh5,t1_eoo66kj,1558799009.0,"If the player base is still there and the game is still fun, then I could probably come back. I am glad to see people are still playing the game and that its being updated even though its a bit slower to get content. 

I think I will play it today and see what I think. I will need to change the announcer from Kevin though. Makes me sad."
heroesofthestorm,eoqzcrt,t1_eoo7m9c,1558798841.0,"I definitely sympathized as I watched a lot of HGC and watched a lot of streamers lose their jobs. That was pretty miserable to see that go down. Especially since it was so sudden without assisting those streamers. I agree though, the game has always been great. I tried playing some other mobas and HOTS is just more fun and the content is awesome. The hero and level design is so much more interesting. As long as there is a solid player base, then I could see myself coming back. I do think I did overreact though. It was tough to see, but the game and developers didn't deserve me to ditch out on them."
heroesofthestorm,eoqyx52,t1_eoo7o31,1558798667.0,"Since its been a bit after the implementation, how well does it work? How did the meta change if at all?"
heroesofthestorm,eoqynt0,t1_eoojg16,1558798567.0,Good to know. I will keep that in my when I try again.
bipolar2,eoqyhsp,t1_eookuo9,1558798515.0,"Yup. I got too mad once at my wife and scared her. After that I quick cold turkey and never looked back. She is more important to me than drinking, but it did help my control my mood swings. Best thing I have ever done."
bipolar2,eoqxdte,t1_eopcv13,1558798086.0,Agreed. I scared my wife once with my mania and that was it. I realized how quickly I was bouncing back and forth and the extremes were getting worse.
heroesofthestorm,eoqx79w,t1_eopun99,1558798014.0,"No, the game itself has always been great. HGC just made me so salty towards Blizzard/Activision...I mean, it was probably activision for the most part."
heroesofthestorm,eoqx0i1,t1_eopxvek,1558797941.0,"I was never really mad at the game, but I couldn't believe how poorly they handled HGC and the effect it had on all of the staff."
heroesofthestorm,eoo6ook,t1_eoo66kj,1558730773.0,"I did and do have fun...then I listened to the Anduin spotlight and heard Kevin...Then I left my announcer as Kevin and forgot. Still stings pretty good, but I should be an adult and deal with it I guess.

&#x200B;

How is the game and hero balance? I remember there were some changes with XP and catapults or something that put a bunch of people off."
bipolar2,eonc6jx,t3_bsgfmb,1558708933.0,Quitting drinking was the best thing I have ever done for myself. Almost 4 years sober now.
