ChildrenofDeadParents,f6nlj1i,t3_drztsu,1572994175.0,Hi there. Sorry to learn of your loss. Please try not to blame yourself for not being able to change what happened. It's hard to get your parents to listen to you because they're accustomed to giving out directions. Your father sounds like a wonderful person and he just didn't know either how bad it was. No one's fault and especially not yours. You did the best you could with the information you had. And while unemployment has its own problems it's likely good for your health that you don't work for an employer who doesn't take matters of life/death seriously. Please hang in there. Maybe your fiance can help you think of a hobby or activity that you could try. It sounds like he may not have the time to do it with you but maybe it would be a fun little exercise to have a brainstorm.  Please take care of yourself as best you can. Give yourself a pat on the back for sticking it out through the grief. You're brave.
ChildrenofDeadParents,f21gagk,t3_dbcvck,1569871886.0,That's a really sweet picture. My thoughts are with you and your surviving loved ones.
Anger,ex2cud6,t3_cq8yce,1565967080.0,"I sympathize with what you're going through. I went to an anger management course and it did help me in some ways. The best thing I got from it was to keep an anger diary. It's eye-opening and if you stick to it you can learn your patterns and then how to handle them when they come up. You can google that because I don't want to promote a book here, but anger diary template should be free and easy to find. Most of all, please find a way to be kinder to yourself. The self-loathing really feeds the anger cycle. Just try, I know it's very difficult. Wishing you the best."
