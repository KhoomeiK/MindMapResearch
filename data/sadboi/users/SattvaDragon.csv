dating_advice,fqiac2r,t1_fqhavqu,1589393243.0,"I think I'm going to have a strong partnership because my partner is learning to respect boundaries I've developed as well. There's an interesting point of comfort where you realize you don't have to respond to people in certain ways anymore. If you want to say no you can even decide to just have a very quiet resolution about it. The motivation beforehand was somehow to please or be liked (accompanied by frustration when it didn't work). This was even in cases when responding to say no or disagree with someone, and just blurred the lines so I could be wobbled into a yes or an agreement and feel like I made a mistake that hurts me afterward.

Now the motivations are to create a good life, master aspects of myself, follow my own lead, be aware.. so for someone like my partner there's no confused wavering when she hits a wall or doesn't get exactly what she wants from me. Because she stays around afterward and knows there's a part of my character that she can't push through there's a bond that develops. She knows when I do help or give in some way it's because I really can and have chosen to. Ironically this is what some of the past pleasing and attempts to be liked might've been searching for but it just had no basis for bonding."
Anxiety,fqgpg07,t1_fqgng5w,1589352895.0,"Yea from what I know there are different causes of anxiety. Mine is trauma based and anger from someone who is only suffering a minor inconvenience is something else to my mind, it's like anger for no other reason than to cause harm. Theres probably anxiety from social judgment or exposure from some asshole sounding an alarm out over nothing and creating a tense social atmosphere, but less so than my own system thinking it needs to be angry too, and then trying to suppress it because it's too much and no one will understand it. I'll instead just be there with unwelcome images running through my head and halfway check out because I'm afraid of acting in even a slightly hostile way and start directing something outward that is totally different from what the situation actually is. The deeper want is to just be comfortable with what I'm doing and talk to people because I actually want to, not because they suck at being around others. Yes there really are a lot of people who won't realize how easily they can make others uncomfortable, so that's how it goes. Sure I've come a long way but it's such a pain in the ass to reset my days just like youve had to

I think I found an angel or one with the blood of the goddess Hylia or something, I'm still trying to figure out if I'm dreaming or not. I think this is how advice like ""stop trying so hard and it will come to you naturally"" actually be works. Get out of your head long enough and wasting energy on flawed efforts, then come back and try something different.

""Nice guy"" is a really vague concept and maybe locks people into a useless shame identity, just my side opinion. Focus on specific behavior change like it's experimental and potentially fruitful, not for the salvation of your terrible ""nice guy"" soul

As another side note, during my dating adventure I couldn't figure out all of these dating streaming platforms. 2 minute ""dates"" with streamers with 3k people watching.

LifeProTips,fqds41m,t3_gi7rkx,1589295624.0,"There's an article on Psychology Today that talks about one of the positive sides or uses of shame. What I took was shame will lead us to feel bad enough in the face of something deemed important in ourselves/the world/our place in the world that it pushes us for change. Learning and reconnection to something positive may be required. It outmatches the emotions and behavior where we just carry on with something that may very well be impeding on our happiness. It's a story for a limited being in a vast, complicated universe.

At the same time there is toxic shame, and then people with depression probably get the whole bad feeling and behavioral shutdown without having any way out. 

Since he never shuts the hell up, Trump is an example of a shameless person. He never learns new things, admits no limitation, does not change significantly for some positive end. He doesn't have connection to anything that makes people truly happy, content, or manifest useful positivity. He just has a Krypton glow that attracts weakened individuals and makes them weaker."

But if I'm having some weird shame response like I've done something terribly wrong that is impeding my happiness and perhaps corrupts part of the universe and now I have to change my entire character and behavior structure to accommodate the terrible problem of not hearing someone call me when they've started a new cashier line.. hey cursing my gods rampantly in the car to get it out of my system helps.

dating,fpdq05i,t3_gcabj0,1588531906.0,"I think I'd suggest you install about 4-5 dating apps that don't absolutely require money (unfortunately most of them do make it a lot harder if you don't spend, but just make do without the extra features) 

Then at various times in the day impartially go through all 4-5 apps for like 15 minutes (for the session, not each app individually) to make a few swipes and send out messages. Start sending out messages to everyone you like if the app allows it. ""Hey *name*"" is boring but can work fine. If someone follows up you say more boring things like ""nice to meet you. How are you"" and then flow from there. You don't have to be a comedian or pickup artist. The idea is you're not getting locked into one app or one person (although maybe eventually) and staying above the battlefield so to speak to maximize your chances. You're keeping your profiles active which boosts your presence on the apps in most cases.

 It's almost like you're treating these apps like a casino (without the money loss) and you're making active bets and gambles to stay in the game and one day you will hit the number that lets you cash out.

Im not going to use a word like 'guarantee' but I'm pretty sure you'll see some different results if you do something like this. It's the strategy that worked for me so I can get to the conversation phase. One addition: just keep experimenting with new photos and profile summaries, you'll have several apps to try and do different things on. practice will make you better at it and it's another way of keeping your chances higher since some apps reward the activity of updates. There are also articles online about photos and summaries that aren't going to be holy grails of advice but might give some ideas.

You could also experiment with some of the apps that match people for camera chats. It's a different field and some of them have their own quandaries and paywalls but even if it doesn't lead anywhere it might feel good just to know you're having real interactions (potentially with attractive others) and practicing social skills.

my picks: Bumble, okcupid, plenty of fish (definitely the best place for messages but stay alert as fuck for scams), hinge, tinder. coffee meets bagel can be an extra 6th since it requires like 3 seconds of your time on a daily basis."
dating,fpcmfxk,t1_fpc6a96,1588505986.0,"I felt awful about how hard I pushed her over that when she had the perfect photo somehow so that seemed to keep me in it. There were probably two parts of me afterwards, one which was suspicious and another that wanted to buy into the person. During that period I reverse imaged like a dozen photos I was given and nothing came up. Also googled her phone number for any bad signs. I thought I was safe after that location switch incident when we friended on facebook and updated our relationship status. she had 2-3 years worth of posts and 400+ friends. Then she had her story (in relatable chunks, not as a spiel) of being a newly unemployed fitness coach in new York City with no benefits coming in and debts eating away at her so she could barely afford food. I offered to buy her some time. 

But I will learn, bottom line is there's no reason a person can't figure out how to make a phone call or a video call (or just make a video and send it to you) in this day and age and there's no reason money should be exchanged in a new relationship. After thinking it through I think this was some group of people who work together, the phone call was very weird like the girl was being monitored for her replies. Also, such as curating the Facebook profile. I seriously couldn't figure it out, Ill report it to Facebook but the convincing detail over a long period of time is baffling to me. Maybe it's a hacked account. And the girl in the photos might even be remotely involved, either directly or indirectly (such as a friend/boyfriend benignly asking her to pose in certain ways occasionally and taking intimate shots). It does seem like a lot of effort was put in for the (relatively) small amount of money they got out of me in a month. There must've been 4 dozen unique photos that were strategically used to stave me away from my requests about when her phone will be fixed and whatnot and daily contact with maybe 1000-2000 messages exchanged overall. Anyways, I'm kind of just processing more by replying, I do get your point and thanks."

PoliticalHumor,fnueu74,t3_g3luj1,1587260472.0,"Honestly I had some thought in my mind that if the bomb finally blew up in Republican's hands and Trump's actions/inactions started causing mass casualties.. there would be some common sense outrage. Like what the fuck you fat chump, stop killing my family and friends. Instead the bomb has blown up, they've lost their hands, there's another bomb strapped to their legs, and it's the same political mindfuck reversal of the situation. It's just unbelievable. I've heard people use their mouths to say the Coronavirus is all a hoax and it's fucking insane. No. No it is not. If we're beating it it doesn't mean it was fake, it just means we did the right thing to better our results. And we're not even in that situation, the death till is approaching 40,000, and we're probably easily going to lose 100,000 Americans to this thing."

worldpolitics,fn69x6h,t1_fn5imow,1586692975.0,"In the States there's been a system developed, for whatever reason, where the poor have to practice rugged individualism and the fortunate are given the 'socialism'. It's probably one of those things that develop similar to popularity.. when something is popular, people only see the popular thing, so it gets more popular, and so on. So maybe there's something going on where rich and fortunate people are in the position they're in, can keep making that position more fortunate and the wealth even larger, and they can keep doing it because of how fortunate and rich they are. This might even create a special class of skillful, competent, powerful people at some level, but at the expense of a huge amount of people's potential. I'm probably sounding like a Marxist leftist by now.. geez.

Government should be something that tethers a process like that and helps equalize the playing field somehow, just like you're describing. That's the equality of opportunity argument. It ends up allowing the benefit of everyone, and everyone can feel satisfied making something like that grow.. a system that has the potential to benefit everyone.. in the same way rich people can get richer, because they're rich.

Maybe we have gotten caught up in something you call an Oligarchy, I don't know. American Exceptionalism Oligarchy. I do know from experience people struggle in a lot of strange ways in my country and some people feel like they get somewhere by getting their head above water into the middle class and feeling better off from the others. 

I'm probably close to breaking through to the middle class once I sell one of my first house builds. I want to travel more. I loved Finland when I chose it as a somewhat random destination. Traveling gives a lot of perspective on my own country and what we need to progress."

I can't even bring myself to confirm or deny every post made about him because he's a fucking chaos agent. His financial interest in this drug he's been pushing to counter Corona (which does absolutely nothing and has even  harmed people) just pushed me over the edge. He's a piece of shit person.

Edit: I had to found out for myself. The hydroxychloroquine claim as being financially beneficial for Trump is mostly false, he has a very small and indirect stake in a mutual fund for pharmaceutical companies. It doesn't mean it is useful advice to keep pushing it or that it has any scientific basis without clinical trials....

It doesn't mean he hasn't used charities in New York  to improperly intervene in the Republican primaries and his political interests.
Or made profits off his resorts by constantly visiting them and racking up charges for the Air Force and White House personnel.
Or was not going to have millions of dollars funneled into his accounts by attempting to hold the G7 at one of his resorts.
Or that he doesn't misconstrue information, outright lie, or just avoid truth and facts on an almost constant basis

If you can't trust someone in a position of leadership, he's a bad fucking leader."

to be clear.. they don't know if they'll find life or not.

I basically have no income until the house sells since I put everything into it and I'm living in a small motor home to keep the place vacant. lol. As we all know there's not much of a jobs market... I've been selling a whole bunch of my things to make ends meet. But other than that.. yeah, it's been nice. It's been restful and more meaningful to just spend time with myself in a new way, not have pressures to be socially active and performing all of the time for others, spend more time with family, stay focused on my work (I've literally got an artists brush out to get whatever little detail is left on the house interior), pick up some new practices like meditiation. Not saying we should have more pandemics, but we should do this social remoteness activity shutdown thing more often (accommodating the economic side effect in some manner).
