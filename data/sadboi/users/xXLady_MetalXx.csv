BPD,fr27an2,t3_gm7dgu,1589832370.0,"Hi there! I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre dealing with this. I‚Äôm familiar with your pain so I know how you‚Äôre feeling. My ex of 15 months broke up with me and a month later went NC. I felt I was gonna die! I vividly remember the car rides home during my long commute. It‚Äôs when my ‚Äúimpulses‚Äù really tired to make me do reckless things but I knew if I did something like, driving my car off the road... he‚Äôd still continue living his life as if I never existed. 

There‚Äôs not much I can say because everyone grieves differently. Everyone handles things differently so what works for me may not work for you. The best piece of advice I can give you is that you should make peace first with yourself and then your solitude. Learn to embrace it, give it a tight squeeze and tell yourself you‚Äôre gonna be okay, because you will be! Also accept that your healing and progress is gonna take time ‚ô•Ô∏è I will have been diagnosed a year in July and I can tell you you‚Äôre gonna go through many many changes. I‚Äôm definitely here if you ever wanna talk.

Hugs!"
