FragReddit,fpcg73r,t1_fpbfhgw,1588499404.0,"Ich hatte vor etwas √ºber einem Jahr eine Instagram Fanseite f√ºr seinen Hund (@fannibottas). Irgendwann hat mich 'ne andere Fanseite angeschrieben und meinte, Valtteri h√§tte in einer Instagramchatgruppe gesagt, dass er gerne meinen Nutzernamen h√§tte. Da gab ich mich schon 'n bisschen gewundert, weil warum hat er das in der Gruppe gesagt und gefragt, ob jemand von den Mitgliedern mich anschreiben kann, anstatt es einfach selbst zu tun?

Dann hab ich ihm also geschrieben, um zu fragen ob das wirklich stimmt, dass er den Nutzernamen haben m√∂chte.
Darauf kam die Antwort; ja, das stimmt, und wenn ich ihm meine Adresse schicke, k√∂nnte er mir auch was als Dankesch√∂n schicken.

Also hab ich zur√ºckgeschrieben, was stelle er sich denn unter ""etwas"" vor, und naja ich f√§nde vielleicht F1 Tickets gsnz cool, wenn er das organisieren k√∂nnte. Au√üerdem soll er doch sagen, wann er Zeit hat, dass man das mit dem Namen organisieren kann, weil wenn ich meinen Namen jetzt √§ndere, aber er erst in 'ner Woche den ""offiziellen"" Account macht, k√∂nnte den sich in der Zeit jeder holen und dann geht das ganze von vorne los.

Seit dieser Nachricht von mir kam nichts mehr zur√ºck, aber er hat sie gelesen.

W√§hrend von ihm nichts mehr kam, kamen von zwei der anderen Fanpages, mit denen er in der Gruppe geschrieben hat Nachrichten nach dem Motto ""wann √§nderst du denn deinen Namen?"" ""Hallo, Valtteri will was von dir"", worauf ich nur sagte, dass ich momentan mit ihm dr√ºber rede.

Nachdem Valtteri nach zwei Wochen immer noch nicht auf die Nachricht geantwortet hatte, hab ich noch geschrieben, dass das Thema f√ºr mich jetzt abgahakt ist, aber wenn er Interesse an dem Nutzernamen hat, soll er mir einfach noch mal schreiben.

Die Kr√∂nung des Eisbergs war dann, als die Seite, die mich zuerst angeschrieben hatte mir noch eine gAnZ LiEbE Nachricht geschrieben hat, laut der es eine Unversch√§mtheit w√§re, ""Tickets f√ºr den Namen zu Verlangen"", und ""Es ist der Hund von Valtteri und Emilia, er hat den Namen verdient, also √§nder ihn jetzt!""

Und aus der Aussage mit den Tickets schlie√üe ich, dass Valtteri wahrscheinlich die Nachrichten, die ich ihm geschrieben hab in dieser Gruppe diskutiert hat, aber wie gesagt, er hat sich danach nie wieder bei mir gemeldet..."
FragReddit,fpa6ybe,t3_gc58dg,1588442058.0,"Ich hab vor knapp 2¬Ω Monaten Tommy Johansson (Sabaton Gitarrist) getroffen, vor 'nem Konzert. Er war super nett und gut drauf, und hat sich total gefreut, dass ich nicht nur die Sabaton CD zum Signieren dabei hatte, sondern auch noch das Album von seiner anderen Band. (Hab dazu auch noch 'n Post auf r/sabaton gemacht)



Ansonsten sind da noch 'n paar Rennfahrer aus DTM und Formel 3;

Sophia Fl√∂rsch ist super nett, durfte mich auch mal in ihr F3 Auto setzen, super sympathisch.

Mick Schumacher war nicht wirklich gespr√§chig oder so, konnte man aufgrund des gro√üen Interesses an ihm aber auch nachvollziehen. War der Tag, an dem er F3 Meister geworden ist.

Lando Norris war 'ne pure 10/10. Er hat bei der Autogrammstunde weil er keine eigenen Karten (mehr(?)) hatte, einfach eine von seinem Teamkollegen genommen und auf der R√ºckseite was gemalt. Passt zu dem Eindruck, den man auch in der F1 von ihm bekommen hat.

Ansonsten ist Maro Engel auch super korrekt. Hatte in Zandvoort 2017 im ersten Rennen viel Pech gehabt, wurde von der Strecke geschoben, war kacke. Mein Vater und ich standen unten bei den Trucks und er l√§uft vorbei, geht hoch ins B√ºro, guckt von oben runter, wir winken. Dann kommt er noch mal runter um sich 'n bisschen zu Unterhalten und Fotos zu machen, obwohl er eigentlich alles Recht hatte, angepisst zu sein.

Valtteri Bottas hab ich nicht pers√∂nlich getroffen, aber mit ihm mal auf Instagram geschrieben. War insgesamt nicht so ganz angenehm, und das ganze hat ihm bei mir ziemlich viele Sympathiepunkte gekostet. War 'n bisschen kompliziert, w√ºrd es bei bedarf aber weiter ausf√ºhren.."

Apparently a lot of autistics suffer from some form of disordered eating or an eating disorder, in total about 40%. Some reasons for that are that eating disorders have a lot of rituals and rules, plus calories are some clear number your brain can focus on, which are comforting for autistics. Also for many of them their food choice is already limited due to sensory issues, and this can be another factor. The article also said that especially female autistics start to diet to ""fit in"". Since they can't really relate to other neurotypical girls and form friendships like that, they try to 'at least be skinny like the other girls' (My ED voice tells me to be skinny and beautiful so that people want to be friends with me even though I'm weird) And yeah since autism is also widely underdiagnosed in girls a lot of girls get diagnosed with an eating disorder/often anorexia first before they get their autism diagnosis"

When I arrived I got told by security that apparently I missed all 5 of them by just a few minutes, but if I wanted to I could wait and see, also the window of their backstage/dressing room was right above where I was standing. So I did exactly that.
After about one hour in the rain the soundcheck was over and I spotted P√§r, Hannes and Chris behind the glass doors going upstairs. P√§r didn't notice me, Hannes saw me and nodded in my direction, and Chris was calling someone, but saw me and waved (I'm still so amazed by that). But well, that was it for some more time.
But after about 2 hours of waiting I saw Tommy upstairs behind one of the windows. He saw me and waved, I waved back. A few moments later he signalled me to come to the side entrance, and he came downstairs to meet me there!
We talked for some time and took photos, and when I asked him to sign my CDs he did that, and then mentioned that he knew where Hannes and Chris were right now, so he offered to take my CD and pen and get their signature too. And since P√§r was in a meeting and Jocke was nowhere to be seen Tommy at least gave me P√§r's bass pick too!
