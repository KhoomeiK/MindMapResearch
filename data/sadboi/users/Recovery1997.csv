medical,f58adbm,t1_f589j3u,1572052121.0,I felt like the side effects where getting pretty bad so I went to the doctor and they moved me to another anti depressant. I still feel really ill and did have a panic attack this morning.
Anxiety,f587lgw,t1_f58723v,1572050242.0,I'm sorry to hear that
Anxiety,f4eeb9g,t3_dkdi05,1571556580.0,"You say you battled with it alone, did you ever feel like not saying anything because you didn't want to bother anyone? With me that's how I feel and I think it's because of a past experience. I had problems with depression a long time ago and I reached out to someone who I thought was a friend. They said to me I was just trying to seek attention. I feel like ever since then I haven't said a word to anyone because I fear of being perceived as someone who's just making everything up to get attention. I really love my friends and all i want is for them to be happy, i hate the idea of dumping my problems on them, so i never say anything. I just put on a fake smile and say that I'm fine. The anxiety makes me terrified of my friends finding out and laughing behind my back even though I know they wouldn't do that. Its only lately I actually told my sister and it was very hard for her to even get it out of me. It wasn't until she sat me down and forced me to talk to her."
Anxiety,f4e373j,t3_dkd62d,1571551429.0,"I know when my anxiety is going off by looking at my hands, I shake like hell and find it very hard to do anything with them. My friend at work knows I shake alot and likes to help me out, I don't think she actually knows why I do though and sadly when she jokes around it sometimes makes it worse. I also too cannot eat when its going off, when I try my body tries to make me throw up. For some reason though I can eat apples so I live off them when Its going off or force down some crisps with a drink. I don't get headaches but lights get really bright for me. I haven't really found anything yet but sometimes going to a cold place to think helps."
Anxiety,f4dzc80,t1_f4aavy7,1571549746.0,"This happens to me a lot too, I will wake up early and feel extremely exhausted but unable to get back to sleep as I'm worried that I have to be somewhere in a few hours."
Anxiety,f4dyspw,t3_dk2os9,1571549515.0,Yes I do that alot and end up going to sleep around 7 too. Also though some nights I tend to worry about what I'm going to do the next day and will try and plan every possible outcome and never feel like I'm ready.
Anxiety,f48zo0z,t1_f44qbh5,1571453350.0,"Thank you, will check it out"
