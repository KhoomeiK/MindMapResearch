Like how long would they have to be exposed to light ?"
depression,fibvb06,t3_f791jw,1582330975.0,"Its always temporary just very hard to see your way out of it. 
I'm struggling with depression too but through consistently trying to improve my point of view the day to day slightly improved. 
Something about the way we were brought up through our experiences we develop our owne way of perceiving different situations. I feel like we can improve on this by acknowledging where our sadness is coming from and working to improve our reactions. Also exposing yourself to new experiences help to change your point of view. Get out of your regular day to day that might be supporting you negative habits or reactions. 

It's been about 2 years for me where I'm trying hard almost every day to make improvements and I'm only really now seeing slight improvements. 
So be diligent but remember to love yourself for who you are dont think to much about the past or future and focus of what's making you happy today"
DigitalMarketing,fhwjydd,t1_fhwbjar,1581918229.0,"So brandawarness and reach are you choice. You can view the same metrics when posting a video through any campaign. 
Cost is broken down by impressions always unless otherwise changed in the ad set I think. 
The reason and brand awareness campaign are the cheapest for impressions because less advertising is dont competitively in this area. You'll want a hight budget for something like conversions because more advertisers are putting ads in that area. 
If you chose the video views the people that are sent that ad are just most likely to watch a video and showed that trend on FB. 
When you're ad goes out you're charged in an auction for ad space so the price always varies theres no set price"
LSDTripLifeHacks,fgt4g65,t3_f0377e,1581098842.0,"Take everything everyone says as a grain of salt and do your research. But my assumption is that you're neurons are being over stimulated. 
Its stressful and I'm sure the brain gets tired but if theres a chemical there in the brain you'll experience a reaction until your body and brain can fully eat it up. Just make sure to get alot of sleep drink water and try not to use your head to much the next day so you can recover."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fgshvz1,t3_f0377e,1581084745.0,"Is it like your brain is metabolizing the acid? Or kinda like a pulling or a tug behind the head? 

I've also experienced during a moment of extreme euphoria it felt like all the neurons In my head were firing off at the same time and it kinda burned/hurt like a pressure. Gave me a bad headache the rest of the trip 

Anyway is any of this similar?"
LSDTripLifeHacks,fevdy5c,t3_eqd1hi,1579396322.0,I'm my experience I take the extra dose during or when I feel my peak starting. Helps to ride out a longer peak. How I feel when I take the second tab or more is usually the part of the trip that I intensify
LSDTripLifeHacks,fep3yfo,t3_eq28u2,1579311598.0,Get yourself a test kit and start testing your acid.

Psychonaut,fcz37m7,t1_fcyw8zf,1578092749.0,Thank you for the tips! I have anxieties but deal with them pretty well on a daily basis lol. Definitely gonna try the kambucha!
Psychonaut,fcyw0db,t1_fcysxwx,1578088302.0,I live with my bestfriend/stoner buddy unfortunately cant really depend on him to be a good trip sitter lol. This conclusion was drawn after trying him as my trip sitter. Might try discord and tripsit app and just do it alone and write myself some reminders around my house.
Psychonaut,fcyoywc,t1_fcynhgu,1578084156.0,"In my experience with acid I was able to take a decent amount and be lucid. With shrooms, my first and only experience on 1.7gs I kept forgetting I was tripping so when something happened it would catch me off guard. I went blind and freaked out at one point. With acid I know I'm on a trip the whole time so something happens I can quickly meditate on that feeling and give in but I might fight it on shrooms not fully realizing I'm tripping. Also I want to take a full 8th or 5g. Entering unknown waters and just want to go in safe and comfortable. My mind isnt right and I'm aware of this but am using the substance for personal development. I'm ready to see what I need to. Also dont like to be alone so that feeling on a trip isnt something I want to experience when my focuse is on other things and development."

Psychonaut,fcxznu8,t1_fcxqg43,1578072701.0,"I love pets but I just lost my dog on 1/1/20 so I'm not ready for another fury friend just yet also I would feel bad leaving them if I ever left the country. It's a commitment I'm not able to support like I would want to at my time in life i guess. But not a bad suggestion, I've thought about it. Ask my family to cat sit if I have to go somewhere."
Psychonaut,fcxuczq,t1_fcxtfx5,1578070633.0,"If it was acid I would agree, I'm pretty coherent. But I kinda wanna go deep and from my experience I forget I'm tripping on shrooms when I'm on em so as long as I have someone to remind me I'm able enough on my own to let go and ride the trip. Also just hate being alone, wont like the feeling better on shrooms."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fbwe6u6,t1_f8m6k5u,1577147568.0,"I could could and do clear bowls packed with about 0.3-0.5gs of weed and I pretty much smoke before everything especially before I sober up so smoking and 8th, 3.5g is almost a daily thing. So incorporating that tolerance into my acid trip didnt do much but bring me to a more familiar mind set. The effects at my tolerance lvl compared to yours as a 16yr old who probably only smokes on occasion are completely different. I wouldn't suggest pushing your tolerance daily though especially at a young age. But I also took blotter tabs and I'm not totally sure how jell is different or if it even is. But yeah I was blasted on the 2 tabs hahah. I could walk and move continously though so taking a bong rip was no problem. 
And I've fallen asleep at the 6hr mark on half a tab before. I just found a comfortable euphoric spot on my bed and focused on all those comfortable feels."

LSDTripLifeHacks,f4mdyf9,t1_f4g00jy,1571677191.0,"Yeah i actually took some real acid last night. the first 2 tabs were never tested, my homie just came home with them on my birthday. The last one I took though was tested and i also made the investment in a LSD testing kit as well so I know what I am consuming in the future. Thanks for the info friend."

LSDTripLifeHacks,f28hukn,t1_f28avac,1570061984.0,"Haha yeah when I was first starting to smoke I would get crazy anxiety and that helped me learn to go slower but I honestly thought I would feel alot more after 90min haha 
I'm glad I took them both though! Was a intresting experience."
LSDTripLifeHacks,f28ho4w,t1_f28e53y,1570061856.0,Yes! I've been on a journey to strengthen my mindset and heal from my past and that's why I just took the substance Haha. I want to learn my mind and self.
LSDTripLifeHacks,f28hgas,t1_f28apf6,1570061701.0,That's honestly an idea I got from it. I ended up telling my friend the next day I wanted to go to therapy lol
