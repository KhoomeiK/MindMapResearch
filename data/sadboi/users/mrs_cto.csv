I think it's because last year I had a contract job for a while that forced me to drive ALL over the part of my state I live in and it made me such a better driver. So I'm for the most part a confident driver."

A few days ago when we hung out, she asked me how I was doing with it and I said ""well it is what it is. I'm not the first best friend to go through this, and I won't be the last."" But it totally sucks. Me and my husband are very close with her and husband as well, so really I'm losing two very special people. She married a fantastic, caring guy. 

It's a little strange - I'm optimistic and sad at the same time.

But we'll talk, I'll send her gifts at Christmas and her birthday for sure (I'm a gift giver by nature. I love spoiling the people I love.)."
