TheGirlSurvivalGuide,esqk1m2,t1_esqjdav,1562204059.0,a care package is a cute idea :D And I do hope to get to see her at least a couple times a year.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,esqjv7w,t1_esqjcgm,1562203959.0,"Luckily she'll be only a couple states away. And a HUGE bonus is that I love to drive. So assuming whenever I can find the time/money to go, it won't be a chore at all. I'm one of those crazies that thinks driving is fun lol. I think it's because last year I had a contract job for a while that forced me to drive ALL over the part of my state I live in and it made me such a better driver. So I'm for the most part a confident driver."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,esqi5fm,t1_esqhf5x,1562202955.0,"Thanks so much for this. I've shed some tears already. A few days ago when we hung out, she asked me how I was doing with it and I said ""well it is what it is. I'm not the first best friend to go through this, and I won't be the last."" But it totally sucks. Me and my husband are very close with her and husband as well, so really I'm losing two very special people. She married a fantastic, caring guy. 

It's a little strange - I'm optimistic and sad at the same time.

But we'll talk, I'll send her gifts at Christmas and her birthday for sure (I'm a gift giver by nature. I love spoiling the people I love.)."
