TBI,f7od75k,t3_dx9mrx,1573925488.0,"It could be both, who knows. I’ve had multiple mTBI, too many concussions, ptsd, and it has manifested mentally and physically. 

I had a simulated NDE through two concurrent syncope episodes due to arterial spasms. Knowing the black void, the pure bliss, moving towards light that is associated with lack of o2 and bodily chemicals that are all company to the early stages of death are awakening and terrifying understandings. That might contribute to an existential understanding that changes personality. 

The trauma to the brain can rewire the fundamentals and shut down or create hyperactivity in certain regions. The hormonal and chemical imbalances due to this can also cause personality changes. 

All the details of the causes are different but they manifest in similar ways in all of us. Unfortunately the treatments are similar, so I have found that questioning the why, or trying to understand the mechanism, has not been the best for me. It is what it is, and integrating it is important, but the present and the future are going to provide the most benefit. 

Stay strong, it is not easy, keep grinding, and look forward for your motivation. Every day is a chance for a small victory, but many will involve small setbacks. Don’t let them define you. You have today!"
ptsd,f6pnccl,t3_ds8aof,1573060142.0,"I am battling through this right now, and the CBT has not helped, so please don't bother too much there.  EMDR is opening me up to the traumas and replacing them with the reality of today.  The fragments of trauma stored in the emotional brain are different types of memories than the logical, time based, memories.  I have found the most amazing help through reading ""The Body Keeps the Score."" I feel like the book is about me, but it has allowed me to start to understand that there is a way out of this jacked up state of being and the discrepancy of past positive memories vs the insane traumas experienced.  Please take the time to sit in a book shop and read a chapter or two before jumping in, because I am only speaking from my personal experience of hitting the bottom and desperately trying to claw my way out.  The medical institutions are not really trained and receptive to the clusters of symptoms and may not be able to provide the insight into the mind-body connection.  

I am on my way towards being the best version of myself that I have ever been.  I am going to blow through my expectations and have an understanding of my past, present, and future that will set the stage to heal to the best of my ability, and I want that for all of you.  The reading is providing the focus on self, movement, and sensations that will allow the memories to integrate and become part of the logical brain's timeline of your life.  We will not be overruled by them anymore with the inner self taking charge.  You are complex and can probably benefit from some understanding of the bodily mechanisms creating these feelings and memory vaults.  

Im coming from burns, belts, manipulation, verbal, emotions, chaotic youth experiences - coupled with multiple mTBI's (loss of consciousness), too many concussions to deal with, and have brought death.  The fragments are a part of me that is a part of my story, pain, guilt, and strength.  You have fought this far, keep fighting harder.  You are more than your negative experiences."

depression,f6drckm,t1_f6dbfhi,1572796438.0,"I miss you. The you that is in there right now, fighting, clawing, and envisioning what you want to be. The journey is difficult and rough. I miss the you that you want to be and may have been in the past. That you is on its way out. Small steps to help the brain heal. Maybe today is drinking water, a small walk, a healthy meal, or just breathing and meditating. You have got this and you will be back. Just one small thing for yourself today to show that you that your mind cannot bury the true self. You are beautiful. I will not miss you for long, as you will be back here with us. You are a warrior."
