As for pets, I previously had pet rats which I didn't take great care of, back when I was 12. They did however tell me that if I were to have an ESA that I would be 100% financially responsible for it. I did the math and can afford a smaller ESA (reptile or small mammal). I feel I'm more responsible now compared to when I was 12, and even got to take care of some dogs and pet reptiles up at college for a week or so. But my parents didn't want to hear any of that.

relationships,fnapi5x,t3_g0m532,1586801537.0,"OP I feel you, I really do. Something somewhat similar has happened to me. My ex and I dated for almost 2 years and it was without a doubt the best relationship I have ever had. But there was always this part of me that wondered what it would be like to date other guys. Due to a few reasons and some minor complications, I broke up with him. Let me just say that my mind was not very clear both during and after the breakup for a while. It took me a couple months to figure out some problematic patterns I had (in terms of mental health) which made me push people away, including him. After going on a few dates with some guys post-breakup and one of them turning into a somewhat exclusive relationship, I couldn't help but compare them to the relationship I had with my ex. I regretted ever breaking up with him. 

Long story short: I confessed to him recently that I regretted the breakup and that while I still had feelings for him (and he also still had feelings for me), that now was not a good time to get back together. We are both starting college soon, so the long distance wouldn't work out. The timing is off, even though we still feel for one another. I don't know how our feelings will change in 3-4 years, but I'm hoping for the best. With that being said, I'm trying to not hold out on him per se, as you never know what could happen during college and beyond. Nevertheless, I feel as if by some mercy for the universe, I've been granted a second chance with someone I truly love and deeply care for. I am lucky.

For you, I would have to agree with RageAgainstYoda. It seems that you and ""Andrew"" have always been a bit off, at least timing wise. I'm sure you can't forget that he confessed he had been in love with you, and you rejected him. He's not going to forget that either if you try starting a romantic relationship with him. Right now is not the right time to go back and attempt to start that. He is sure to be heartbroken after his failed engagement, lives in a different state, and he needs time to heal and move on. For you, I would focus on this other relationship you have as it sounds great. I know it will be really difficult, but try not to compare this new person to ""Andrew"". Focus on the person and on giving them a real shot. If the relationship runs its course and you still have feelings for ""Andrew"", AND both of you are in a good frame of mind to start something new, try reaching out to him. Make sure to build a strong foundation of trust and friendship first, then maybe test the waters with a romantic relationship. I speak from personal experience. Of course if both of you are in different states following the if you've moved on from the other guy and are both ready for a new relationship, I wouldn't necessarily try that unless one of you is moving to somewhere near the other somewhat soon. If you want him in your life, you could remain friends or close friends for the time being. Just let him know that you're there for him. Patience is key."

AskReddit,fn5vath,t3_fz6655,1586677142.0,"So towards the beginning of my ex and our's relationship, my ex's parents would occasionally knock on his door to either check up on us or tell us food was ready or whatnot. The first few times they knocked and we were in the middle of sex, we would just say ""just a minute"" and while one of his parents was awkwardly standing at the door for up to 2-3 minutes, we would be rushing to get our clothes on, and when we answered the door I'm sure our faces were very flushed. After a while they stopped knocking and just texted him when they wanted to check up on us. 

Another time we were going at it doggy style. His bed was right next to the wall and we were going at it a bit rough which made the infamous shaking sound present throughout the whole house. His mom spam-texted him telling him to stop what we were doing because it sounded very much like exactly what it was. She had no idea we were doing it as we were 17 at the time and anytime his mom asked him about it, all he would say was that we were taking slow intimate steps. We changed positions and were pretty quiet after that."

AskReddit,fmh8qu9,t3_fuupql,1586070566.0,"Matched with this cute guy and we exchanged our snaps. We hit it off really well over text, as we seemed to have a lot of things in common. Now for context, this dude was super into dirt biking and fractured his right wrist just 2 weeks prior to our planned date, so he said it would be a bit awkward as he could only use his left hand and he was right-handed. I was like sure, whatever. Let me just say that while I don't judge a man for height, it weirded me out that he said he was 5'6 and upon meeting him in person, he was 5'3 (I am 5'2). The date itself was actually pretty fun, albeit a bit awkward at times. 

The second date somehow is the next night. It was one of those things where he was in town and said he would pick me up, so I was like, ""Fuck it, why not?"" For more context, he lived about an hour away. We get to the restaurant and his sister and her boyfriend are there. Might I remind you this is the second date. It gets weirder from here. The dude starts rubbing his hand on my knee and on the inside of my leg underneath the table. He keeps treating me as if I'm his girlfriend and we've been dating for a while. Next thing I know he has me meet his dad. And when we're eventually left to ourselves, he doesn't stop touching my butt. I tell him to stop and he says okay, but doesn't stop. He says ""it's a habit"" but previously he told me his last serious relationship was 2 years ago, so like does he just grab his own butt for fun? What a time."
BreakUps,fm9j67m,t1_fm9bvuv,1585869818.0,"Lol I sure did. Tbh I was glad to have a little space initially, but pretty soon after it felt like a part of me was just...gone. I started missing him a lot when I started dating. Meeting new people and examining how I felt with others compared to him really showed me how amazing he was. At random times during the relationship I would wonder what it would feel like with someone else, to see if I could have this connection with someone else. The answer was a big no, and I found that out the hard way. Albeit I made it difficult for myself. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" only lasted for a little while; eventually it wore off for me. But I think that depends on how strong of a connection you had with the person. Like I've said previously, we had a very strong bond and have always been drawn to each other since we met. That certainly helps."
AskMenAdvice,fm90f9k,t3_ftnd01,1585859370.0,"Being someone who is similar, in that I have both depression and anxiety and I need someone who can return my texts within a couple hours or so, I feel you OP. When I was dating my ex, we talked almost every single day, sometimes calls or videochats. When we did long distance (when I moved to college), calls and videochats became an everyday thing too.

It sounds like he's overwhelmed. He may have other things going on in his life, in addition to you that he may not be telling you. Does he feel like he can talk to you or is afraid to do so because he feels you need to be calmed first? Try asking him about his day, see how he's doing. Also it is possible he might be moving on, but don't jump to extremes quite yet. 

This will be very difficult, but in moments where you need someone to talk to, don't always reach for your boyfriend. You can't depend on one person entirely to soothe your emotions and thoughts. Look for other ways to do this, such as engaging in your hobbies or just talking to a friend. Hope this helped"
BreakUps,fm8yp1f,t1_fm8pn3s,1585858471.0,"There were a few reasons. 1) the long distance; we'd only see each other once every 4-6 weeks, and only for a day or so; 2) during my time at college, I started developing feelings for another guy and interpreted that as me moving on; in reality, I was just missing my boyfriend; 3) for about a month or so before the breakup, my depression and anxiety were slowly coming back (I did not realize it until much later), so I subconsciously pushed him away as a result

I don't think so, but it's possible. I have more time to think and reflect on things now. That's why I wrote the letter; I just have so many things to say to him but it's definitely not the right time. It's like 7 pages lol.

I honestly thought I was over my ex following the breakup until one day it was like I got hit with a ton of bricks with the reality that I was definitely NOT over him.

The regret came from how I broke things off so terribly. Being at such confliction with myself, I didn't know how to articulate what I was feeling and why I needed to leave, just that I needed to.

AskMenAdvice,fl3dlh1,t1_fl3de0i,1584778970.0,"I broke up with him because despite our relationship and bond being very strong, the long distance of only seeing him once a month while I was 5 hours away at college and he was back home just wasn't enough. I also felt like I couldn't truly explore while having to tell someone everything new I has tried that day, that it was exhausting. What I didn't realize was that I had a best friend that was just as excited, if not more than I was, for everything I was doing"

ballpython,fib2kpu,t1_fia4mak,1582313322.0,"Thank you so much for the advice! I'm a first time BP owner, so despite doing a ton of research, constructive criticism is great. 

Enclosure:

I've blocked out 3/4 glass walls for now to induce less stress; he'll be moving to a PVC enclosure come summertime, which will also be bioactive. I got rid of the UVB, and will be switching the infrared to a second CHE I already have, as well as get some pulse stats for the CHEs. The humidifier has 2 tubes that are in the enclosure itself (they are out of his way so as not to stress him out but are close enough to the bottom of the enclosure so that the humidity level is constant). One of the hides is a half wood log, but I will probably switch it out for another plastic hide as he seems to enjoy his plastic one better; both hides keep him snug.

 Feeding:

His previous owner tried to wean him onto rats using similar color and size but he wasn't taking to them. I'll try weaning him once I've got him onto a consistent feeding schedule. As for thawing his current prey, I'll be changing the tap water halfway through to make sure it's still very warm when offered; it's been warm when offered every single time, but having it warmer doesn't hurt! I'll be cutting down handling until he eats again, and will try different feeding times.

Again, thank you so much for the all the advice, this has been very helpful :)"
