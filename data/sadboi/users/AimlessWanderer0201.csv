WhatShouldIDo,fa991by,t3_e84jfa,1575865690.0,There was a guy who did that to me. We had a similar relation to yours. I haven’t been the same since. Work on yourself. But pushing her away won’t actually help. You’re just going to hurt her. People who push others away think it’s for the best. Don’t take that choice away from them. They will live with that pain for the rest of their lives. Ghosting causes trauma especially the closer you are with each other.
relationship_advice,f3oct8t,t1_eybz3tr,1571014449.0,"I was in her shoes. I’m definitely over the person who caused the hurt, but I’m not over the hurt. To this day. But I love my bf and I think I’ve expressed to him enough about the trauma I suffered. Now, I just deal with it on my own bc I feel slightly ok facing it by myself. But yes therapy is very important."
depression,eyabufc,t3_cw89h3,1566961125.0,"To be fair, the avg person is not a therapist. They don’t know and have no training to say or do the right things. Saying or doing the wrong things can worsen depression. I think it’s unfair to expect much from others. After all, they have their own shit to deal with too and being a friend on tap is exhausting.

I think I’m a very good listener and supportive friend, but it’s very draining to press pause on my busy life to be at someone’s beck and call bc they’ve either had another panic attack or depressive episode. So now I just say I’ll be there when I’m able but no guarantees. When I went through my own depression, I ended up just talking to a therapist so I don’t burden my friends. I also spread my conversations around friends so no one person gets completely dumped on. It just takes balance."

It’s a beautiful song. Deceivingly upbeat. But now it haunts me. I’ve moved many places. I never found home. I can honestly say, the only time I feel home is with people who care. But they all have their own lives to live, even my boyfriend. I feel so lost because there is no connection anchoring me. I’m alone."

depression,evza1ai,t1_evz3ax0,1564952568.0,"What are you going on about? Your response sounds way too personal, like it happened to you or people you know, then you broad brush and apply it to OP. I didn’t see any bashing. He’s simply not perfect but a flawed individual. But I don’t see him dehumanized.

She clearly loves him but feels overwhelmed. And she’s stated her support of him. For everything he doesn’t do, she picks up the slack. I call that invisible labor. That hardly ever gets appreciated. And quite clearly it’s apparent based on the comments here bashing her (basically people telling her to shut up and deal with it).

I think moral of the story here is communication needs to be had and if there is none, then the parting of ways is the only option. She sat down and talked to him periodically about their issues and he acknowledges them then doesn’t do anything.

“Moral here is of you’re a man, don’t get married.”

Your comment is very misogynistic and very one sided. To me, moral of the story is he really needs to commit to getting better, if that involves staying home and taking over her duties and get therapy and treatment and she goes to work instead. Or it could be he shouldn’t get married if HE can’t commit his part. Have you tried watching kids on your own while trying to study? I’ve seen my sister do it. While possible, she gets exhausted all the time. The moment they wake up to when they get put to bed. And guess what? She has depression too. You seem awfully sympathetic towards the husband and have none for the wife because you can’t relate to her. You do for him.

Be grateful and take care of the kids while we boys work then play video games! Yea I’m sure women love hearing that 🙄 You’re acting like she’s a lazy ingrate when in reality, she’s overwhelmed, tired, and wishes to fulfill her own career dreams too where it can also support the family."
depression,evydelt,t1_evybyv5,1564929781.0,"That is ridiculous. Are you a woman? Are you a married woman with kids? If it’s a no to any of those, you cannot speak for these women and their lives and experiences. You are making assumptions about them which is completely unfair. I’ve seen so many women wiped out and stressed to hell basically handling everything: emotional support for husband and kids (and to an extent friends and family), make sure kids are fed, healthy, have all their shit done (homework, activities), bring them to school, pick them up, deal with any issues (if kids have disabilities), cook, clean, organize everyone in the household’s schedules. They have almost no time to themselves. And you know what that leads to? Depression and anxiety. Yep, everyone of them have it or will develop it. My own sister did and almost killed her self. Now she’s still doing all those but also going after her dreams as a researcher in the psychology field. And she still has depression bc her husband thinks working and coming home is enough. Because his mental exhaustion is more important than hers. And she’s called selfish all the time bc she wants a career. But she still does everything at home too!

You can excuse the husband and say he needs all the personal time to himself, but you don’t think she deserves it, just because she asks he gets therapy?? The work at home is unpaid work. Which the husband takes no part in. And the work maintaining the household is a lot of emotional and cognitive load for any human, male or female.

And it’s completely obvious she’s done very much for her home AND her husband. Yet you have no compassion for her. You clearly relate to the husband more. Will you relate to her too once she develops depression?"
depression,evycl1t,t1_evyax8b,1564929179.0,I’m on mobile so I can’t see the thread embedded properly. This wasn’t addressed to you. It was addressed to the people attacking OP.
depression,evy6wq0,t1_evxz2vi,1564924500.0,"What the hell? So she must suffer to appease someone else? Her wellbeing is just as important as his. You’re basically telling her to suck it up so that her own mental health suffers for him. Just, no. His job is to get help. She’s not a therapist or a nanny or mom. She’s his wife. She’s already doing her part. See the first post. He’s not doing his part. And that’s getting treatment and therapy."
depression,evy6jhg,t1_evy145j,1564924160.0,"I sympathize with you and I’m not married or have kids. I see it suck the soul out of my sister. She is working on her post doc (she gets paid) while caring for the kids and home and she has depression. Her husband doesn’t contribute much and goes out of town all the time while she juggles work AND her kids. I think the other two posters are being very unfair. Any single person can work all day and come home. But married ones come home to food cooked for them and laundry done. And they don’t see the invisible labor women have to go through and then tell them off for “complaining” and to “be grateful”. Fuck that noise. Don’t listen to their nonsense. You are doing your job. He’s not even trying with therapy. Don’t let them make you feel bad for doing everything you can while all he does is work (which even single people do). They’re using your marriage as a scapegoat for his lack of trying (oh he brings home the money!) You have to your own career to care for things he doesn’t do. Don’t let them excuse his lack of trying. He married you so in essence he agreed to share the load. Money does not always equal effort. Anyone can throw money at shit. Anyone with time. Anyone who chooses how they spend their time.

I work full time. But that doesn’t mean anything. I’d do it whether single or married. So they are making excuses for his lack of effort in his own family."
depression,ev77kp7,t3_cilr92,1564256251.0,"Well you have two ways to go about this:

1. Wait it out. Most therapists don’t recommend making rash decisions that you’ll regret later. Depression can distort your thinking. If it’s something you can talk it out with your partner, do it, communication especially during depression is important, even if it’s, “I just need some space for x amount of time for mental health recovery” or “I just want to make sure it’s not depression distorting my thoughts...”

2. Break up or take a break. If you can’t take care of yourself, you can’t take care of others. Also if the problems have been there for a while and you guys talk about it many times to no resolution, you might not be compatible. 

These things involve communication and talk with a therapist to separate distorted thoughts from reality."
