My mechanic (who I trust) looked it over and drove it with me before I bought it. I've also put around $2k in to it already and I've had it a year and half, and it still doesn't run well. I never have enough $$ to buy another used car,  but then somehow come up with $200, $500, $800 when it needs to be fixed. Used cars are a risk and vicious cycle. And people say learn how to fix stuff.. I am not built that way. I feel for you, I'm in the same boat. Bad credit (my fault, I know) and not enough cash to buy a better used car."

Personally I love both.  I watched the first 2 specials before I found the podcast, so I was surprised that he was different on the podcasts. I don't think the way he does podcasts would work on a stage with a crowd and mic. The podcast is so random (you're wearing jacket, that's so random); I am sure he picks out ideas for each pod, but he really it seems like he just runs with it. If he treated stand up like his pod, stand up would be wildly different in each city. That's not how stand up works, right? Being fairly new to Chris' work I find it interesting that this sub is mostly about the podcasts and less about all his other work."

With The 2 y/o, we take their stuff from the parents and help the kids come in and take off coats. The 3+ year olds - we are getting them ready got kindergarten when parents HAVE to leave them at the door. Most the kids are great at coming in with their backpack on their back and anything else they need in their hand. They put their stuff away (coat and backpack on the hook) and give the lunch box to the teacher, and put their water bottle in the water bottle bin. It took a while to get the parents used to it, but we just tell them ""we find it's better to the kids to say goodbye at the door and come in independently.

Water juice etc. We give them water if they want it, we don‚Äôt deprive them but every child comes with a cup with their name on it or bottle or whatever.

While you lose weight,  instead on focusing on your weight / shape, try focusing on the things you DO like about yourself. Some examples:  Do you have nice hair? If yes then learn different ways to style it. Maybe color so you feel fresh and new. If you don't like it, fix it. Get a haircut, in a new style. Are you in to make up - you don't have to be, it's just an example  - if you are in to it, get better at it. Watch some YouTube tutorials about it.

AskWomen,f55zl8w,t1_f55zfk7,1572016247.0,It‚Äôs awesome. I envy the people that said they had a close connection with their mother. I definitely didn‚Äôt have that.
TrollXOver30,f55ze8w,t3_dmx9db,1572016165.0,"Stumptown is not the best new show on tv, But I love the cast. I watch it for them.

Cobie Smulders- great actor, hands down. Very underrated.  I don‚Äôt think this character is much different than Robin from how I Met your mother but I just love her.

Jake Johnson- ugh, such a crush on him. Granted he pretty much plays him self in most of his acting, I adore him so I love it. 

Michael Ely- He‚Äôs that guy that you always say ‚ÄúOh right, that guy from that show.‚Äù Loved him on the good wife, and on being Mary Jane. I think he also pretty much plays the same character everywhere he goes but I love it. 

And Cameron Manheim - It‚Äôs nice to see her working. She‚Äôs always great.  

It‚Äôs only four episodes in and it‚Äôs kind of cheesy but I enjoy it. Plus it has good soundtrack. Feel good late night action drama TV without much substance. Yes, please."

I‚Äôm 44 years old, and when I was a teenager my mother told me- while walking past me in the hallway as I put make up on in the bathroom mirror - ‚ÄúJust remember, if you get pregnant you‚Äôre going to the abortion clinic and then covent‚Äù or  ‚Äúoff to your father house‚Äù, which ever she thought would hurt me more at the time.   I never felt comfortable talking to her about anything serious or personal. I don‚Äôt have kids but I make sure that my nieces and cousins and friends kids can talk to me about anything."
