And the majority of ISIS recruits are young men, like 86% of them. You join ISIS, you get a wife or sex slave. It's part of the promise they make to lure men in.

I’ve noticed fake profiles of trans women on social media the past couple of years and reported them and they usually get taken down so I’ve been right before. I don’t understand the motivation behind it other than it seems to follow a pattern: it’s a photo of a beautiful woman saying something about being trans, and they are always ‘passing’ very well and get lots of followers or upvotes. Sometimes they message people to get them to ‘date’ them which could open up scam opportunities or look at a trans dating website or porn site. The reason I Think it may be fake is the name is cherrythetranny, and obviously tranny is not a word the Trans community likes to use, but of course you could argue she is taking back the word or something, also the person has no other posts, and their profile says mtf trans, and they commented yesterday to someone saying they were ftm trans and had been on hrt for five years, and when I responded saying your profile says mtf, they deleted their comment. It’s a little odd to mix up mtf and ftm when you are talking about yourself and also kind of odd to say it in the first place.. none of these reasons are enough on their own but all combined I am suspicious bc it fits the sort of fake profile of trans women I’ve seen in the past."

Teachers,fo64f4x,t1_fo646at,1587546108.0,"Yes! The principals pander to that and so do administrators. It’s like we’re all the red headed step child being put it up against our siblings or something. I had an administrator this past year from the district that I worked with all the time do that kind of thing with us, my team, and even refer to us as girls, and sweet poor girls, and at the same time she was just a nightmare boss to work for I’m still convinced she might be a sociopath. I worked at another school and the principal would point out a teacher she thought was so amazing but it always felt cold to everyone else busting their ass. And even the concept a teacher of the year I think is messed up as hell. That’s the only recognition we get pretty much because we don’t get raises or promotions and all we have is teacher of the year and the odds of getting teacher of the year are so low I mean come on."
DreamInterpretation,fo63q0p,t3_g5tqh1,1587545359.0,"It sounds like you are doing the worst nightmare thing- trying to hide a body- and trying to just tackle it head on in a logical way with support from your family, and you are having to take the lead quite a bit. Maybe you feel like you have to take the lead a lot in life and are more educated or mature than some other people in your life. Or maybe you are recognizing that you have certain intelligences and strengths to contribute and its time that you start using them and be a leader more often, or you already feel like you are a leader.

Maybe you have a family secret or you can show a certain side of yourselves only with each other, as families do, so maybe you all are close- except not close enough to infallibly hide a body, with the cousin who told someone and didn't disclose it to everyone else first, which shows me control was very important to you in that situation (as it probably should be), and that that person wasn't being thoughtful of everyone else just by telling someone without asking. It seems like that part is about control- you needed to have complete control over the situation because the others might tell someone or make a poor choice, and maybe they don't worry as much as you do so the burden of worrying is mostly on you.  The fact that you were still on some kind of scavenger hunt or race to me means working as a team and the adventure never ends, and maybe on this adventure you are ready to use your mind and gifts to get ahead, but maybe you feel like everyone isn't as cautious or worrisome as they should be, and the burden of worrying sometimes is on you."
DreamInterpretation,fo627nf,t1_fo5wsdd,1587543751.0,"Thank you for your response and analysis bird-song!! I think you are onto something!!

I think when people give and you are expected to be grateful even if you got a raw deal and they look like a hero, it can feel like you were manipulated, and you aren't allowed to feel sad, because you are supposed to feel so lucky and privileged. She did end up kind of being the star and she actually got an upgrade- her newer arms were way better than the ones she gave me!!

It's like when rich people give to charity the charity is supposed to feel so grateful but the rich people still come out way on top and get all this praise, while the charity is still suffering. And if the charity (poor person, healthcare worker, whatever) complains, people call them ungrateful!

And I never remember giving my consent, like I literally just woke up with the zombie arms, so I didn't have any control. It was kind of like I was invisible. But I was also so happy that I had been given the arms and I was in awe of this woman for giving me her arms. She barely knew who I was and did something so selfless.  Noticing she now had these better arms seemed in poor taste. It felt like I was supposed to just be happy with what I had and things could go bad at a moment's notice so just be grateful and try to be a better person, like this woman... but then, obviously, this woman was actually getting the better deal so who could I really trust.

On a more personal note, now that you mention all of this, I do have an inferiority complex, and I think it could also be about feeling invisible and manipulated, as well as guilt for not being gracious or generous enough. But because the person I was 'not as generous as' maybe wasn't so generous anyway, and it's mostly a farce. It's pretty unrealistic for someone to just give someone their arms, and even more unrealistic to be grateful in that situation, where I got the crap arms and she got good arms. So maybe it's also my brain trying to tell me to lighten up-- that I have these hang ups all the time about being privileged and lucky and I should just be happy and all the amazing people out there that I don't measure up to, that I'm actually just as human as they are and just as entitled to feelings as them. Maybe if I wake up and I have zombie arms I should be freaking pissed off or at least start asking questions before I start feeling guilty!

It's like how the lower classes are supposed to be grateful constantly. Or women are supposed to be gracious all the time as well. 

There are all of these teachers driving around to their student's houses to give smoothies and gifts in the middle of a pandemic, and posting about it to their coworkers and on social media. They are only endangering the families they visit and getting attention for being saints. This relates to it too.

And maybe the arms being infected looking is a reference to the virus, who knows."
Teachers,fo5k1r9,t1_fo4ua4f,1587527557.0,"And of course told everyone at the school about it so they can get attention, I assume?? Just sick! I kind of agree with another comment on here, that that's part of why teachers don't get a lot of respect in society, because there are so many teachers like that one, its like they are the goodie two shoes in high school trying to suck up to their teacher, who is now their principal, and get praise. Grow up!"
Teachers,fo5jtmm,t1_fo4uq21,1587527396.0,KIPP teachers go door to door to recruit students I think. That's what a KIPP principal told me in New Orleans.
Teachers,fo5aq7d,t1_fo4x5h4,1587521227.0,I kind of agree too... like do either/or. Not a middle grey thing. Like either we keep it professional or we just do full on hippie 'community' style. The grey thing is confusing and stressful!!
botw,fo2glq1,t3_g590cg,1587461644.0,how did u do it?
PublicFreakout,fo2edpk,t3_g527a4,1587459194.0,"The homeless in San Francisco are known to be extremely confrontational in general, compared to other cities. It's bizarre. San Francisco has a reputation of being mean too. I used to live there and do think that although I've met amazing people there, it was one of the meanest cities. I've been screamed at and chased down by so many homeless crazy people there. Much worse than this lady!"
Teachers,fo1uz1s,t1_fo1p7p5,1587442094.0,"Oh yeah its weird. My mom was like that when I was little, and she was better than her parents, but her parents were like that too. I used to think there was this world of 'others' out there, like the kind of people who were trashy and littered and wore too much lip liner, but when I was in Middle School I remember realizing there were no others. We were all the same, humans."
