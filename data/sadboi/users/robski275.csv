depression,fpwxqxc,t1_foxl4jm,1588971900.0,"1st of all: thank you so much for replying (im serious, thanks).

I've been feeling way better the last few days, because im active now. I help my grandpa on the farm (daily), I've made amazing online friends, I've gotten better at using my anger as a source of energy, I began taking sleeping meds for my sleep anxiety, I've got a new game to focus on and its my 16th birthday in 19 days (so I'm gonna have more freedom and I'm actually counting the days to my birthday. I feel like an 8y/o again). I've done an eq (emotional intelligence) test and I have an eq of 20/200. So I'm pretty numb, I only have the 6 basic emotions. 

And again, thanks man. I really appreciate you responding AND ESPECIALLY IN 1 DAY!!
I hope you feel better now."

So I have vacation atm (for the rest of this week) , but I still have so much shit to do for school and with my deadline anxiety I rarely get my shit done because of the stress I've been having.

I've been mentally neglected for a few years by my parents, because my sister has had a lot of metal issues and she used to cut herself (I once saw her do it) and she even went to a sort of hospital for a few months.

I don't really feel the need to live anymore because of the stuff I've been through (I am 15 btw). I haven't really felt actual happiness for so long and it has never been so bad then it is right now.

I dont really have anyone to talk with (I have friends but I don't want to bother them with my problems, because everybody has his/ her problems). 
Propably because I can't really relate with anyone around me. 

Normally I could take my mind off off things by gaming but that doesn't do the trick anymore. 

Sorry if I made some mistakes but I'm form Belgium so my english isn't perfect.

I do really hope you guys have a great day."
