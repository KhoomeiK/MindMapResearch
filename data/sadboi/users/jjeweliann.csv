We rescued a lab mix last year and found out a few days later her heart was already seriously enlarged and she had congestive heart failure.  The shelter had told us she was a stray, probably 3-5... Vet said it was impossible to miss her heart from even across the room from her breathing.  We had her 8 months and she was a perfect dog... The shelter paid for her meds in favor of us having to return her to them, because it was our first adoption and mote than we were prepared for, definitely. 
$7000 and we would have had no choice but to give her to a rescue for help in that situation.   I hope the happiest to both of you, that is so tough. 
My advice is definitely reach out to the rescue you got your dog from!  I'm so glad he has you right now."

All of this I'm POSITIVE contributes to many of the dead bedrooms... People with shit, unfair, unrealistic perspectives who blame their partner and just get all resentful about it instead of, like, anything else.  Why yall dating people you hate and don't respect tf"
DeadBedrooms,fegr68f,t1_fed711m,1579100610.0,Good lord that's a rule here?  Beginning to be more and more clear this is a toxic unhealthy space
DeadBedrooms,fee7ty1,t3_eof2qs,1579028186.0,Having disingenuous ingenuine parents is worse than having honest ones who broke up and found healthier relationships. I don't understand how any parent could find this better for their kids.  Over sex.  Just go.
DeadBedrooms,fee2esm,t3_eojngn,1579024983.0,"The best sex doesn't come from immediate perfect chemistry, it comes from two people who can communicate about it and want to do more and better and different as time goes!!  My fianc√© and I were shaky at first and now I can't imagine what all we will get up to as we live our lives together."
DeadBedrooms,fee0m36,t1_fedd0d8,1579023892.0,He sees them as objects who would just please him.  Guys like this are submissive until they're more confident in bed.  Gosh I have so much experience and context in all of this.
ABA,fee0awh,t3_eob2ui,1579023679.0,"I feel that often in this job.  I recently had to approach my managers and ask to be taken off a team I had just agreed to join a few weeks ago, even though I was only there once a week.  (high intensity aggressive client, double my size, but they really believed in my because I have a strong skill set and history)...
I also need this job because before this I was in the same field but worse pay and worse management.  I love my management now and they're great so it's hard to want to leave that, but I know I can't do this forever even though I have been for so long.  I just try to have very strong boundaries with work because my personality makes it really hard too.  I worry about it a lot.  Now my schedule is manageable again and I'm feeling good.  So yeah, definitely first step is seeing what management has to say and if they can help/if they will.  Thanks for what you have done!  It is hard and it takes special skills to do this, definitely."
