AskReddit,fqbty5i,t3_ghmse0,1589243862.0,"I had no idea how expensive it was to go to the movies. My mom has four kids. When you factor in snacks and drinks along with the ticket... shit. When I was in high school, I ended up getting a job at the theatre and let me mom watch as many free movies as my employee perks would allow to finally return the favour."

I’ll always be able to see the appeal and potential of how great children COULD be even if I am never going to have them. I just remember that right now I love my life too much for it to so drastically change forever."

EatingDisorders,fpq20ei,t3_geh0u8,1588813585.0,"Reading all these comments almost made me cry. But it is also a bit of a relief to hear that this is very much a real thing we’ve experienced and makes me feel less guilty about how I thought I was just always being overly sensitive and dramatic. Body dysmorphia has been haunting me since I was maybe 13 or a bit younger. It hasn’t been just about weight because over the years I became hyper aware of other imperfections on my body like facial hair (I’m south Asian lol) and my nose and teeth. Even stuff like my eye shape. It really does affect every single way I can see myself. It’s gotten a bit more manageable now that I’m almost 30, but fuck. It will always find a way to sneak up on me."
WeightLossAdvice,fovabow,t3_g9kud2,1588097994.0,"Congrats on your goal! 

I grew up in a fast food for dinner kind of house with two working parents. I used food to deal with a lot of self-esteem issues (I know right). My parents shamed me a lot for my body and told me to control myself as a kid despite bringing in the unhealthy food every grocery trip. In my late teens and early twenties, I started struggling with really bad disordered eating and fasting. I lost a lot of weight very quickly and everyone praised me for it. I was losing hair and binging at night. I did really poorly in my first year of university simply because I was so hungry all the time. Took a few years to recover from that, and now in my late twenties I live on my own and continue to recover and finally treat my body well. The only way I was able to get around it was to control my own groceries and live in my own space. I know that isn’t realistic for everyone and I’m grateful I have the means to support myself. It’s been a weird journey."
