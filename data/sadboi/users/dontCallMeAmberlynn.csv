No arguments here, just posing questions so you can feel out your choices. Questions that I wish I’d have asked myself before making a big leap. 

If you think you can get a job where he works and continue to work there making more money even if you don’t happen to stay together then it might be a reasonable leap. You could end up like that and just look for a platonic housemate afterwards. That’s not unreasonable. It’s just uncertain times out there for lots of people right now and if you think you can thrive you should go for it but if you need more time to sock away money for an apartment or room in a house hopefully that’s not the end of the world and it’s over sooner rather than later. 

Either way, I wish you luck and happiness in your journey!

Edit: also you have nothing to apologize for... that’s a sign you were raised by narcs. I had to break that habit myself. You’re allowed to say what you please in the world outside of life with your narcs - it isn’t offensive or wrong to respond to people with answers or your feelings on something but sometimes that’s how narcs make us feel because they are broken and they condition us to bow to them in our responses. That freedom in itself can be worth moving. Maybe it is time for you to move out. Love you, human!"
raisedbynarcissists,fr0xa9c,t3_gm16sc,1589808878.0,"I’ll agree I don’t think it’s time yet but everyone is unique and it could be. 

I made this mistake of moving out at 18 in college and getting stuck in a bad position with no money (sick then unemployed because I was sick) then ended up super depressed and unable to get myself out of that hole until 11 years later. I’m a semi functional person now but I feel like I wasted 11 years of my life because I made choices I wasn’t prepared for and it mentally crippled me. 

My parents were narcs. I thought I could make something happen and be on my own but my extended family ended up paying my rent and then I felt like I owed them my life and had to live by what they said. Ended up depressed because the person I was dating who I thought would save me from them was worse than them. We’d only been dating about a month and hadn’t lived together yet when I realized I pushed my family away for some maniac who just wanted to control me also. What was worse? The narc I was dating - his mask finally fell off and all hell broke loose. Everyday was fighting and screaming and lots of drugs and drinking. 

If there wasn’t a pandemic out there I might say go for it but honestly, do you wanna have to take just any job to get away from them? Those can be expensive choices and it you can’t make them yourself do you really want to rely on someone you’ve only known 3 weeks? Have you had a job before? Are all the risks associated with the choices you want to make worth it? Are you ready for this? Only you can decide that. It’s your life and if narcs have controlled you up til now and you just feel stuck I get it but it might be easier to bide your time, build a memorable relationship with your sister for a few more years, explain to her how you’ll always love her and if anyone tells her different then they are mistaken or telling her lies on purpose. Maybe when she gets to be older and you’ve got yourself established she’ll see they are crazy and want to live with you because she sees how you worked through it and got yourself together after life with narcs."

It can be a weird feeling like a new rush of emotions. Try not to convince yourself you’re okay in the moment but that the bad feeling will pass and you WILL be okay. Feel your feelings so they don’t eat away at you if they creep back up. 

Realizing what makes me unhappy and why and dealing with it properly is the only way I’ve found to help my depression. It hurts to try and force it down. Worse than the stuffy face I get from crying.

There’s nothing wrong with a good cry and I honestly married my husband because he cried in front of me after we’d been dating a few months and I saw him as the sweetest man I’d ever met because he let his feelings out in a way that wasn’t anger or manipulation which is what I was use to (whether he was good at actually voicing them was another idea) but I was so proud and felt so loved by him that he felt comfortable enough to cry in front of me. 

There are people out there who don’t believe the stereotype and just want you to be a happy, functional human. Ignore anyone standing in the way of that goal. 

Own your cry. Remind yourself why you’re crying. Feel the pain flow out of your eyes and once you’re done that’s when you take the time to think about how resilient you are as a human. You make these tears to cleanse yourself of pain that might not be fully gone but enough that you’re body needs a release to move on. Some people get locked in their sadness or hate for the way they are treated by others and it prevents them from living their best life. 

I’m not saying walk around blubbering all day but at home with family or with true friends and people who love you there should be no fear for men to cry. It’s a shame society has conditioned out males to think they have less emotions and should only show the manly ones."
antinatalism,fqzj0sf,t3_glsi87,1589768410.0,"I completely agree. 

This is kinda my argument of “I didn’t ask to be here” but from the parents perspective which doesn’t make sense because they most likely had an option to make educated choices but maybe didn’t and ended up with a permanent regret unless somehow you’re a raped woman removed from abortion services and forced to give birth to your rapists baby... that’s a reasonable way to regret having your child but honestly if you’re just in a shitty relationship and hoping it’ll save it or want to carry on your family name or I want to see what my genes look like passed on. Total dumbassery.

Like... okay, you brought me here without asking and now want me to do stuff... but a parent who has a child then regrets it... idiotic... YOU made that choice to bring a person into this world and exactly... fuck them up if you regret it or can’t handle it. I’d much rather regret not having my own kids and teach nieces and nephews and neighborhood kids what I know to help the next generation after I can take care of myself.

LifeProTips,fqwxxif,t1_fqwtckv,1589720882.0,"Your mom must have went to the same school mine did... Youmissedaspot Academy. 

I feel everything you said. I had to move half way across the country and know I didn’t have to do anything my family wanted ever again to feel free enough to try and break the thought that cleaning in punishment. 

I’m 31 and this is my 3rd apartment with my partner and our 2 dogs and we owned a trailer we lived in for 2 years together and only after moving far away and telling myself I have to do things that please me do I have a relatively clean place that doesn’t look like a hoarder just started living there. No place I’ve lived has ever been this clean - it isn’t immaculate and my mom would probably find some things to complain about but previously I wasn’t living in absolute filth either (okay, one very depressed year I was) because I had a certain level of cleanliness I wanted... but to her it wasn’t clean enough therefore unacceptable because it made me “dirty” not just “not clean enough”. Negativity. 
I’d wash the tub because I liked baths but I would let dirty laundry pile up, wait til someone else did the dishes and just eat without dishes because I don’t require what I call “high maintenance standards” which actually showed me how I care to live my life because this is for me. I did it for me. I learned I don’t mind living with less so I have to clean it less. I have lived off grid and that requires actual work to survive - cleaning as you go if possible is best in that situation so I try incorporating that in all of my day. It was a freeing experience and now I see order and tidiness in my living space as needed for simplicity and reducing future pests and problems while I prepare myself to get back off the grid. 

My little brother and his wife are the same way though but worse than I ever got. Laundry lining every hallway and room and overflowing out of the basement. No clue what’s clean or dirty. Nothing folded. All in trash bags. Moldy trash and dishes overflowing with flies around them. Scum so thick in the shower if you take a bath you get out dirtier than when you got in. Most everything they have is either broken or falling apart because they don’t care about anything. Their cars look like trash trucks but they just dump it in the windows instead of the trunk. And here’s the kicker... they’re both always sick and so is their kid. From living in filth. But they love to go to the playground and Skyzone... because it’s fun. I truly feel bad for them because they are both that way and I don’t think it’ll ever get better. I was fortunate enough to have a partner who was clean and tidy to reinforce positive behavior on my end. Having it be for us and not a punishment. It’s a mentality you have to undo and free yourself from for sure. 

That’s what forcing your kids to do things you determine need to be done does to kids. It turns that task into punishment and makes them just want to do other things to soothe themselves or plain old shut down. Explaining the importance of cleanliness and doing it together as a family is much more effective I’ve found. Everyone pick the their favorite task. If it’s just you then just do one task a day and do it consistently for a few weeks. Put some music on. Make it a small celebration. Do it to your own standards of what you deem reasonably clean because you are smart enough to determine what’s “good enough for me!” Because it’s for you and your health and no one is making you. It’s okay to miss a spot or leave some lint."

I look before I leap. I judged why I don’t want kids yet or possibly at all. 

I don’t have or want kids because another childish adult is enough. I am still learning to clean up after myself and function as an adult and have chosen to not have children to take care of while I can barely care for myself... like a responsible human. If you can’t clean up after yourself what are you teaching your kids? If you treat your partner as the maid or let your partner treat you like the maid? I don’t agree with do as I say not as I do parents or parents who can’t give their children healthy foundations. 

I chose the person I married cause we get along and have the same values... if one of the partner values the other partner as a maid they suck. If OP who cleaned up after this messy person repeatedly and enabled them to make a mess more than once had originally said “what the hell is this mess in here, I’m not cleaning this up, get real, I’m your wife not your maid” they’d be my hero. But acting like you’re the maid once and more than once and now asking the Internet why her husband is that way... just seems obvious. OP let him. 

Personal freedom is easier and I know people consider me selfish for it but I’m also not in the business of messing up kids and sending them out into the world to try and function. You don’t have to agree and that’s fine.

Edit: 

tl;dr 

if you can’t use or get another supposedly responsible adult to use a trashcan and a hamper you probably suck. My mom sucked that way. I had to grow up once I moved out. My father had no respect for my mother’s clean house so neither did I. Both adults are parents leading by example, OP has to stand up for themselves rather than ask the Internet. If your partner refuses to follow cleaning and hygiene basics then do you really want them as a partner if they see you as a maid? That sucks."

It helps maintain muscle when you can’t workout in a gym. All you need is a floor. 

As for motivation you can watch a naked yoga video or do it naked yourself or with partner. Look up Kama sutra positions and see if there’s any you find interesting. See if any yoga positions would be beneficial in learning some new bedroom moves?

Doing a video flow is kinda like working out with other people around in a class versus trying to do aerobics by myself in my basement. 

You could also pay for a class... like you pay for the gym... it doesn’t even have to be yoga. There’s tons of youtubers selling their workout plans. You log into a zoom or whatever and workout together and you paid for it so there’s motivation not to waste your moneys.

Or if you need attainable goals type of  motivation you can set a goal to be able to achieve certain poses. Look up advanced yoga poses. Can you do that? Is there space to find motivation in trying to get into pretzel positions? 

Builds strength in places most people never realized needed strengthening. Sometimes it’s willpower and mental strengthening when your body can handle what it’s doing. Yoga is great for mental struggles. Sometimes trying to hold a position can cause a person to cry. The release is intoxicating. Highly recommended.

She quit her job as a nurse to work at his home business where he berated and belittles her... she actually went back and took a job in a hospital fighting Coronavirus... my money is on the bet that it’s because Coronavirus is easier be around than that manipulative, abusive motherfucker. Atleast you know the virus is out to get you and you better watch your back... that guy would pretend to be your friend and throw you under the bus... makes me laugh to think he wastes his life trying to make others miserable and it’s obvious just as soon as he opens his mouth."
SuicideWatch,fpgunt0,t3_gddset,1588609825.0,"I’ve tried. It’s really hard unless you truly give up and don’t eat and don’t get up to go to the bathroom. Then you’re required to soil yourself and stay that way because the wetness or pee and sweat breaks down the skin so rot is able to happen. Like old people and bed sores - if you give up too early your most likely to just end up with a new inconvenient butthole and an infection.

I’m sorry you feel this way. When I feel this way I try to tell myself I’m a flower and maybe I want to die and rot because my current state is toxic somehow and really I’d rather grow into something new. 

Environmental factors can do that to you, beautiful flower - pesticides, pessimists, lawn mowers, mass shootings, not having well balanced soil (living environment) can kill a flower which I liken to heartbreak and not embracing yourself and running with it no matter what. Fuck people who bring you negativity. If you wanna chat about being your own flower and wanting to wither away feel free to message me. I wanna help you try to figure out a way to replant yourself to your liking."
SuicideWatch,fpgueri,t3_g5b6nb,1588609695.0,"I actually just read your post from today and was ready to answer you when I decided to check out your page and see if I could understand you a little better first. 

After reading this, I have to say if you haven’t been over to r/raisedbynarcissists you may want to check it out. 

If you’re mom expects you to get better overnight or even over a week but has been manipulative to you your whole life it’s possible you won’t be able to fully recover from that abuse until you’re away from her for good (no contact) and she’s no longer creating those problems for you. 

If she really says “if you cut yourself then I’m allowed to shoot myself in the head” she is mind gaming you and you need to understand that’s her putting her problems and insecurities on you. It probably scares her to think she can’t control you cutting yourself or wanting to die and she probably feels guilty like it’s her fault but is too selfish to say it in away way but sarcastic. Because she is broken also. Who says that? Except broken people... she sounds like she needs help expressing her actual feelings also. Fears, worries, pain, all of it needs to come out because it’s all bottled up and you having your own feelings you’re letting out is giving her resentment. That’s not your fault - it’s likely her parents broke her. It’s a cycle. That you can stop by recognizing it. It might not be easy but it’s possible. 

She just wants to put it all on you because it’s easier than trying to be a better person. Blaming someone else is always easier. You’re her kid. It sounds like she’s the one breaking you and driving you crazy. She’s supposed to be raising you to take care of yourself and love yourself and go off into the world to do whatever your heart desires. 

I only say this because it reminds me so much of growing up with my family. The mind games. The hurtful comments when you just try to express your feelings. The strong desire to cut for release. I understand these feelings, my dude. I wish you didn’t have to go through them. 

Do you have plans for after graduation?  A career goal? Somewhere you want to move to? I honestly think having a 5-10 year plan might help with some of the stress and give you a place to focus your energy especially if you know it’ll free you from the requirements of living with mom and her issues. It won’t fix things overnight but it’ll be a relief the day you don’t feel obligated to be her punching bag anymore."

I’m not trying to fight with SJWs, I just like to joke and laugh at any expense - even my own when necessary. If you can’t laugh at life and the grand scheme of things... what have you got?


The joke goes:

There’s a woman in a grocery store. She gets up to the register to pay and puts 1 apple, 1 chicken breast, 1 lemon, 1 potato and 1 roll of toilet paper up onto the conveyor belt to check out. 

The cashier asks her how she is... she says “fine, how are you?”

Cashier replies “so, you’re single...?”

Woman smiles coyly and says “oh, by my order...I guess it’s obvious you’ve guessed correctly.”

The cashier smiles and lets out a small snarky laugh... “Oh, I wasn’t paying attention to what you bought...you’re just so fucking ugly it’s obvious no one would ever date you.”"

AskReddit,fpfpmxj,t3_gd5b8f,1588578974.0,"I’m sorry to hear about your brother. 

You could explain life is like a garden. You could even have a flower to pull the petals and leaves off of for a visual tool. 

Babies are the sprouts of the seeds planted in their parents gardens. Like a flower grows so do humans. Like flowers, humans don’t live forever. Sometimes a bug or disease eats away at the body and sometimes it’s just the end of the life cycle for a plant. The flower will begin to deteriorate one way or another at some point and it won’t be able to be saved. But we love our garden and just like we love our friends and family. Unfortunately someone we know and love has been told their time in their garden is coming to and end soon. We will probably watch them wilt. We will give what love, care and respect we can while we can to our garden and loved ones so we can use the pain and love and hard times as memories to grow as people. 

Like flowers, some people are given to us for a reason, a season or a lifetime. It sounds like you got to experience your brother’s whole life on earth. You’re kids sound like they’ve had an uncle their whole lifetimes. Maybe somewhere in there you and your kids can find a reason to move on and honor his memory in some way like every year on his birthday. 

You and kids could even ask if there’s anything special he’d like you do in his memory so every time you did it or played that song or watched the movie or told that joke or went fishing or tossed around a football... whatever it is that your brother would wanna do one last time if he got to come back once a year for a day to celebrate with you so eventually it can be a celebration of his life rather than looking back sadly every time. It will be hard in beginning and you’ll always miss him but feeling closer to the person even though they are gone is still possible IMHO. I’ve lost a lot of family that raised me and I cry once or twice when they die but everytime I hear their song or touch something special they gave me or I hear something that they would’ve said a lot I can smile and talk directly to them even though I don’t hear talking back it doesn’t mean my energy is just floating off into the abyss... I think it finds them. Wherever they are."

Patriotism is bullshit cause it gives people a false sense of self. We are all humans and generally equally susceptible to negative impacts on humans on a human level - yeah we might have better healthcare than Africa but that doesn’t mean we are prepared to service everyone in the country. We are not immune because we are Americans but it seems like some people are so bored they are willing to “give me liberty or give me death” themselves prematurely. 

Not everything is immediate gratification but we are so use to it we feel like it should be. Times are hard but they didn’t get that way over night and when hardheaded people stay out unnecessarily prolonging the problem it makes everyone else more frustrated prolonging the need for quarantine - I could see it becoming a cycle due to people’s hardheaded behavior. Just stick it out, get over yourself and your need for “freedom” because it could be the last “freedom” ever for your neighbor/parent/grandparents/kid/whoever if you foolishly go out and bring it back and they die.
