During the Old Kingdom Horus was associated with the ancient Egyptian rulers (Pharoahs), who were the embodiments of Horus on Earth; ***Each ruler during this time was seen as a reincarnation of Horus***. (Pharoah was horus living on earth - God in Flesh.)

Horus was recognized as their patron deity and protector and had been seen as such back to Pre-dynastic times. This may have been to give legitimacy to the royal succession. As a popular God in both Northern and Southern Egypt before it‚Äôs unification, he was also used also as a symbol of their unity.

However Starting with the Fifth Dynasty, which began in 2494 BCE ***Ra*** came to replace Horus as the patron Gods and reincarnate of the Egyptian rulers. In one of his many forms, Ra, God of the Sun, has the head of a falcon and the sun-disk inside a cobra resting on his head.

If he has everything that you want from a Muslim male, then go for it. You said the Islamic values and the lifestyle is the same - that's a very good thing.

Give it a go, meet up see how it goes from there, what  do you have to lose?

No one is perfect, some people lack this or have to much of that, just give it a go. If you see him as a good husband, a person who will look after you, treat you right, then don't let that simple away simply by looks.

**27. And recite what was revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. There is no changing His words, and you will find no refuge except in Him.** 

We don't play down the Quran, nor change it in away to suit a persons desires or emotions, the truth is the truth. If you have read the Quran and understand what the generations done with the words of Allah from the previous prophets, they done what you are suggesting, that i should change it just to please them or hold back the truth, and knowledge? Ridiculous. 

My friend if you have a problem with stoning to death or the punishment for certain crimes, how do you feel about hell and what Allah will do to these people who have committed crimes in this world in where they will be punished far worse then ""stoning"" some forever?

Secondly, if you have read the Quran, you would of come across this verse, 

O you who have believed, obey **Allah and obey the Messenger** and those in authority among you. **And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger**, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best \[way\] and best in result.

Pretty clear that we follow Allah and our Prophet peace be upon him, that includes the laws that the Prophet peace be upon him says eg stoning to death, as the examples i have given you with the Hadith to back up that law, authentic, yet you reject them when some of those hadith come from the same people who complied the Quran, Hmmm, picking and choosing huh?

See the problem with people like you is that you are ashamed of the religion of Islam and you pick and chose from the Religion what suites your desires and the desires of the people - This isn't what the truth is, the truth doesn't care if people don't accept it or not, the truth (The words of Allah) will not change to suit what people want, we follow what Allah wants, this is what it means to submit your will to Allah, and if you look at that verse, we have to follow the Prophet peace be upon him as well - Clearly stated in the Quran.

It's very clear with people like yourself, who only follow the Quran based on their desires, if it doesn't suit their ""World view"" they reject it or translate it based on their own understanding, i feel sorry for people like you, who dismiss generation of pious Muslims, Hadith from the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. You are rejecting a big part of our religion.

The following verses pretty much sums up a person like yourself and this topic.

28. And content yourself with those who pray to their Lord morning and evening, desiring His Presence. And do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring the glitter of this world. **And do not obey him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance‚Äîso he follows his own desires‚Äîand his priorities are confused.**

29. And say, **‚ÄúThe truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills‚Äîlet him believe. And whoever wills‚Äîlet him disbelieve‚Äù.** We have prepared for the unjust a Fire, whose curtains will hem them in. And when they cry for relief, they will be relieved with water like molten brass, which scalds the faces. What a miserable drink, and what a terrible place."

First of all it's a Major sin in Islam, one of the greatest sins, the punishment for fornication before marriage is 100 lashes to the man and to the woman, the punishment for Adultery is stoning to death. Our religion is very serious when it comes to sex before marriage, this is a very immoral act and Allah does not like the immoral actions. This action spreads corruption in the land. Adultery  can destroy and break up families, marriage and family is very important in Islam.

Chapter 17 verse 32 of the Quran, Allah says,

**32. And do not come near adultery. It is immoral, and an evil way.**

Allah tells us not to even come NEAR it, don't even flirt with that idea.

Do not ignore it, defend the religion, Allah will reward you. Don't allow such people to get away with such things they say about Allah and our Prophet peace be upon him, I don't know how any Muslims can read what some of these fools say about our religion and not say anything - and no i am not saying to fight each and everyone of them and go out there looking for these comments or whatever, i am saying if you come across it, correct it, even if 100 of them down vote and not agree, there might be just one person who reads it and that can bring them into Islam - and that's what its all about, Spreading the truth, defending our religion.

The problem with a lot of Muslims now is that they try to ""copy"" the Christian ""Liberal"" mentality where the Christians allow their religion and belief to be mocked and to be made fun of while they say nothing, and when you ask them why don't they defend their religion they will give you the ""Turn the other cheek"" talk. This mentality is a weak mind set and the Muslims who believes in Allah and Loves the Prophet and the Quran simply can not ""Turn the other cheek"" When people are insulting the religion.

And it actually isn't all bad, these islamophobes actually make us research into our religion more so we can refute their claims, like to all the brothers and sisters reading this, how many times have you heard something about Islam which didn't come from a Muslims mouth? Then you go and research it yourself to find out if its true? - But then you read up seeking more knowledge and learning something about the religion you didn't know in the fast place. Like the amount of time and energy these islamophobes try to find something to attack our religion is amazing, they are so desperate to find some fault in Islam, but time after time we defend it and refute there claims, it is always the same old same with them.

Look at Brothers like, Ahmed Deedat, Muhammad Hijab, Hamza, All the brothers who go to speakers corner and give dawah and refute the claims of the Islamophobes, just imagine these brother had this ""Christian mentality"" and just allowed these fools to get away with what they say about Islam, there would be more  Islamophobic content on the internet, but thanks for brothers like that DEFENDING the religion and not caring what people think, they have done wonders for Ummah.

Essentially what those brothers and all people who are doing Dawah - are doing Jihad, Jihad of the word ( **jihad** al-qalam ), They are striving for Allah, defending the religion with their knowledge and their words, So yes, Defend it, fight for our religion, defend the Honor of our Prophet, no matter what, don't allow such evil things to prevail in society, if you have the opportunity to correct them and to say something, say it.

And don't be disheartened by it, Know that Allah is with you."

You should always go to the Masjid and ask these questions, always no matter what the issue is seek knowledge.

Don't allow your desire to get high be the reason you don't practice your faith properly. Give up things for the sake of Allah and Allah will replace it with something better Inshallah.

Allah always warns us about those who ""Followed their desires"" Don't be one of them, those people end up ignoring and rejecting what Allah and the Prophet peace be upon him commanded, so they followed their own desires and then they were misguided, because they rejected something which was very clear in our Religion - So i warn you, don't fall into that same trap as those who don't want to give up this worldly life to please Allah.

You should continue reading the complete chapter and not just stop and cherry pick what verse suits you. If you had kept reading. You would of come across this which Allah is clearly talking about Disbelieving people...

26. Allah does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. B**ut as for those who disbelieve, they say, ‚ÄúWhat did Allah intend by this example?‚Äù He leads astray many thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He misleads thereby only the evildoers.**

27. Those who violate Allah‚Äôs covenant after its confirmation, and sever what Allah has commanded to be joined, and commit evil on earth. These are the losers.

Evil doers, those who have rejected the truth, don't want to follow or don't care. If you understand the basics of Islam you would know that GUIDANCE only comes from Allah. He guides who he wills. Allah will know if a person will Accept the truth and reject it, this doesn't mean the truth isn't shown to them, example if you are a disbeliever who is reading the quran - The Quran is the truth, if you reject it then clearly you have chosen not to understand or accept it - Hence you chose your path of disbelieve.

&#x200B;

If you read Surah Al Kahf chapter 18 of the Quran you will come across these verses, which sums up a lot of people

54. We have elaborated in this Quran for the people every kind of example, but the human being is a most argumentative being.

55. What prevented people from accepting faith, when guidance has come to them, and from seeking their Lord‚Äôs forgiveness? Unless they are waiting for the precedent of the ancients to befall them, or to have the punishment come upon them face to face.

56. We send the messengers only as deliverers of good news and warners. Those who disbelieve argue with false argument, in order to defeat the truth thereby. They take My Verses, and the warnings, for a joke.

57. Who does greater wrong than he, who, when reminded of his Lord‚Äôs revelations, turns away from them, and forgets what his hands have put forward? We have placed coverings over their hearts, lest they understand it, and heaviness in their ears. And if you call them to guidance, they will not be guided, ever.

Not be guided ever, meaning that only Guidance comes from Allah, because it is Allah who knows the condition of a persons heart, so he guides them he opens it up because he knows there is good in them, but as for the disbeliever he knows there isn't any good within their hearts, so they are sealed up. People chose their paths either believe or disbelieve."

If your brother gets violent one more time call the police straight away, you don't play around with people who have Paranoid schizophrenia.

If your brother acts violently the next time he might even seriously injure you or cause death - May Allah Protect you all.

Secondly, i would really suggest doing some research on this condition as soon as you can, then sit down with your brother and have a one on one with him and make him understand the severity of the situation - He isn't just a danger to you guys but to himself, don't make him feel guilty and speak to him in a nice way.

Tell your brother this, tell him to look back at what he done to your younger brother and regardless of whatever the issue was - there isn't any reason to beat someone up like that. Tell him if he does have this condition and he isn't in control of it, next time he has one of these violent outbursts he potential kill a loved one. Tell him that you notice change in him and that these changes (whatever they may be) are causing a negative impact on his health and your families as well.

Go with him if you can to the doctors office if he agrees to seek treatment, support him at these rough times.

Tell him there is nothing wrong with having this condition, many people around the world (Famous) people as well live with Schizophrenia, but they treat it and that's what allows them to live normal lives, but if this goes untreated it cause damage to your brother and potentially ruin his life because he has allowed the illness not to be treated."

Keep me posted.

Oh and btw brother, this isn't ""Superstition"" this is fact. For us Muslims believing in the angels and the jinn and the unseen is all apart of our religion, so if you reject it you are rejecting the words of Allah, that's why i said before you start make sure you believe in this and ask Allah for help you from this problem."

""**The Sunnah encourages moderation in eating, and strongly criticizes extravagance.**¬†

**The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls, to keep him going. If he must do that (fill his stomach), then let him fill one third with food, one third with drink and one third with air.‚Äù Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2380); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2265).¬†""**"

1400 years ago in the middle of Arabia, why would a man (**Prophet Muhammad Peace and blessing be upon him**) speak to people about ""Trimethylaminuria""? Do you actually think people would understand that? heck even you suggested ""Microbiology"". What use would they have for that infomation? The Microscope would be invented in the year 1590 - That's a thousand years!

Please use whatever logic you have in your brain to figure that out.

Maybe if you should try reading a book about societies and history so you could answer your own questions, see what societies were lacking at that time then you would understand why the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessing be upon him came with the revelations he came with.

Oh and about the garlic thing, go stand next to someone shoulder to shoulder (Like we Muslims do as we pray for about roughly 10 minutes) who just had garlic to eat - it isn't a pleasant experience, then go back and read what the Prophet peace be upon him said and you will see the logic in that.

Here is a verse of the Quran i will leave you with,

**Surah Al Baqarah, Verse 17,**

**""The parable of those who disbelieve is that of someone who calls upon someone who hears nothing except screaming and yelling. Deaf, dumb, and blind‚Äîthey do not understand.""**

MuslimMarriage,fom93fy,t3_g88jde,1587881985.0,"Salaam Brother,

First of all you should be asking yourself that question, but imagine some random guy approached your Sister or Your mother in the street or at the super market, How would you feel about that? Does that look like a good look to you, especially for a Muslim? - I don't think so, it's disgusting actually. You are adopting the western style of meeting women, going around in public trying to chat up random women. That doesn't just make you look bad, you make Islam look bad, you make the Sister look bad as well. We don't do these things, this is what the Westerns do, they made it into a game, it's pretty sleazy to be honest with you, Your also degarding the sister as well like she would be ok with a random guy approaching her. A bit egotistical as well.

Do you actually think the Sister would think ""Ouff what a nice guy so confident to approach me""..She would be thinking ""how many other women did he try this with?"" Or she could be thinking ""omg here we go again, these men never stop weather it be in the super market, on the train, on the street, they just keep coming"" It's sort of like harassment, i remember one sister i was getting to know would tell me she would be overwhelmed by this, she just wanted her space but every time she left her home, it was guy after guy trying their ""Luck"".

Another problem is, how do you know the Sister is single? How do you know her Husband isn't at the next aisle? How do you think the Brother would react seeing you trying to pick up his wife? - It wouldn't be pretty brother.

So think about what you are trying to do, you are committing haram, approaching women who have no relation to you at all in order to pick them up (Regardless of your intention). Secondly you are risking yourself because you have no idea how the Sister will react, you don't know if she is married you don't know if her husband is around or maybe her brother, father etc, and thirdly you are making yourself and the sister look bad by the way you conduct yourself."
islam,foivzwn,t3_g7pbcf,1587798884.0,"**Praise be to Allaah.**

**One of the ways in which Allaah has made things easy for His slaves is that He has only enjoined fasting upon those who are able to do it, and He has excused those who are unable to fast for a legitimate shar‚Äôi reason. The legitimate reasons for which one may be excused from fasting are as follows:**¬†

**1 ‚Äì Sickness**¬†

**Sickness means everything that means that a person is not healthy.** ¬†

**Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is permissible for the sick person not to fast in general. The basis of that is the aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):**¬†

**‚Äúbut if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days‚Äù\[al-Baqarah 2:184\]**

**It was narrated that Salamah ibn al-Akwa‚Äô (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‚ÄúWhen this aayah was revealed ‚Äì ‚ÄòAnd as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)‚Äô \[al-Baqarah 2:184 ‚Äì interpretation of the meaning\] ‚Äì those who wanted not to fast could do that, and pay the fidyah (i.e., feed one poor person for each day). That remained the case until the following aayah was revealed, i.e., the verse:**¬†

**‚ÄòAnd as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)‚Äô**

**\[al-Baqarah 2:185 ‚Äì interpretation of the meaning\] ‚Äì so it abrogated it.‚Äù** ¬†

**The sick person who fears that fasting may make his sickness worse or that it will slow down his recovery or damage a part of his body, has the option of not fasting, and indeed it is Sunnah for him not to fast and it is makrooh for him to complete his fast, because that may lead to his death. So he has to be cautious and protect himself. Moreover, if the sick person is very ill, that makes it permissible for him not to fast. But if a healthy person fears difficulty or tiredness, it is not permissible for him to break his fast, if all that happens to him when he fasts is that he becomes tired.**¬†

**2 ‚Äì Travelling**¬†

**In order for traveling to result in a concession excusing one from fasting, the following conditions must be met:**¬†

**a-The journey must be long enough that prayers may be shortened.**

**b-The traveler must not intend to settle in the place to which he travels.**

**c-His journey must not be for any sinful purpose, rather it should be for a sound purpose, according to the majority of scholars. That is because being allowed not to fast is a concession and relief that the sinner does not deserve on his journey, because the purpose of his journey is to commit sin ‚Äì such as one who travels in order to commit banditry, for example.**

**Cancellation of the concession for traveling:**¬†

**This concession of traveling is cancelled by two things:**¬†

**(i)When the traveler returns home and enters his hometown, which is the place where he resides.**

**(ii)When the traveler decides to stay indefinitely, or for a lengthy period in one place, and the place is fit for settling in. Thus he becomes a resident (or non-traveller), so he should pray his prayers in full and not break his fast in Ramadaan, because the rulings on travel no longer apply to him.**

**3 ‚Äì Pregnancy and breastfeeding**¬†

**The fuqaha‚Äô are agreed that pregnant and breastfeeding women may break their fast in Ramadaan, on the condition that they think there is a risk that they or their children may become ill or more ill, or be harmed or may die. The evidence for this concession in their case is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning:**¬†

**‚Äúand whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number \[of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up\] from other days‚Äù\[al-Baqarah 2:185\]**

**This does not refer to merely being sick, for the sick person who will not be harmed by fasting is not allowed to break the fast; here sickness is mentioned as a metaphor for any situation where fasting when sick may cause harm. This is what is meant by sickness here. That may be the case in pregnancy and when breastfeeding, so these two cases are included in the concession of breaking the fast. The evidence that women in these cases are allowed not to fast is the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik al-Ka‚Äôbi (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúAllaah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of prayer, and He has relieved the pregnant and breastfeeding woman of fasting.‚Äù** ¬†

**4 ‚Äì Senility and old age**¬†

**Senility and old age refers to one who is old and has lost his strength, or who is approaching death, so that every day he becomes weaker, until he dies, or who is suffering from a terminal or incurable illness and has no hope of recovery. The evidence that it is prescribed for such people not to fast is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):**¬†

**‚ÄúAnd as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)‚Äù\[al-Baqarah 2:184\]**

**Ibn ‚ÄòAbbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that this aayah has not been abrogated, and it applies to old men and old women who cannot fast, so for each day they should feed one poor person.**¬†

**5 ‚Äì Intense hunger and thirst**¬†

**If a person is overtaken by intense hunger or unbearable thirst, then he should break his fast and eat just as much as he needs to ward off that hunger, then he should refrain from eating for the rest of the day, and make up that fast later on.**¬†

**The scholars added to intense hunger and thirst the fear of weakness when meeting the enemy, or fearing or expecting an attack, such as when one is surrounded. So if a fighter knows for sure or thinks it most likely that there will be fighting because he is facing the enemy, and he fears that fasting may make him weak when fighting, and he is not traveling, then he may break his fast before fighting.**¬†

**6 ‚Äì Compulsion**¬†

**Compulsion means one person forcing another to do something or not to do something against his will, by means of threats.**¬†

See that my brother, ""Different Caste System"" There isn't no ""Caste System"" in Islam my friend, don't ever say that. You can't justify it islamically this is what we call ""Bidaah"" an innovation in the religion. In order for you to justify that ""Caste systems"" you need to back it up from the Quran and Sunnah, Watch the videos i sent you, it's pretty clear that you can't. Please watch the videos.

&#x200B;

Now personally if you believe in a ""Caste"" then that's your belief, fine. I personally don't care if your culture beliefs in all these things, but to say it is associated with Islam..Then that's the problem, because it isn't. Because now you are saying things about my religion which isn't true, this is when i as a muslim have to defend my religion from things which isn't true.

&#x200B;

Now let's take your logic and understanding of Caste and how you say its the same as a tribe, fine. I use that same argument and say Caste is exactly like Astrology. Your adding personality traits and painting the whole group of people as the same like they all carry the same characteristics, personality traits as each other because they all come from the same ""Caste""  example, let's use the **Jutt or Jat people** Caste, this is what they say about them..

""The Jutt people are a traditionally agricultural community in Northern Pakistan. The history portrays the Jutt as a **brave, courageous and loyal caste,** mostly settled in rural areas. **People‚Äôs psyche with regards to the Jutt is unique. This caste is the one you would wish to avoid marrying into if you want peace and serenity within your household. They love to argue, are ready to initiate a fight and are biased towards their caste brethren. Some may be found as landowners.""**

Now when a person reads that and knows these things which are about this Caste which stand out such as **""Avoid to marry""**, **""They love to argue""** You are generalizing a person based on their ""Caste"", saying that they have these personality traits. Now if a prospect of marriage came to your home and say they were from this caste and you believe these things about them (Which you do, you believe in Castes), would you then give your son or daughter in marry them? if they are a people who **""love to argue""** and someone you should **""Avoid marrying"",**  When in real life the prospect even if he or she comes from that Caste isn't like that, see what that logic and understand does? Your judging a person (A book) by its cover (Caste) Do you think this is fair and just? - No. Do you think this is islamic at all - Hell no, this is oppression and this isn't just at all, it's not fair to have this logic especially for Muslims, this is oppression.

Now let's take the same understand and use Astrology and let's say Leo and let's compare Jutt people with Leos.

"" In summary. **Strengths a Leo possesses** are Brave, Playful, Leader, Fun, Warm, Protective, Charismatic and Generous. **Weaknesses of a Leo** are Egoistic, Demanding, Dominating, Stubborn, Controlling, Show-off and Vain. 

Now let's say the same prospect comes to your home for marriage and instead of believing in your caste system, you believe now in Astrology, it's there tribe, it's their belief, you believe in it. Would you allow your son or daughter to marry some who they say is **""Controlling""** a ""**Show off""** and **""Stubborn""?** When in real life this person isn't any of this, but might be the opposite of all that, but with that mind set and mentality believing in Caste and generalizing a persons traits and characteristic, you are now rejecting a good prospect because you believe in the star sign leo and what leos are, Same thing with Castes.

Do you see how you can use the same argument you made to support even astrology, whats the difference between astrology and the caste system? Nothing, they are both generalizing personality and characteristic traits of a person,  good or bad whatever they may be, it isn't just. And there is no backing in anyway to prove these things are correct, actually if you believe a Person gets their personality traits, characteristic and all that mumbo jumbo from their caste or star sign, then you are saying these things are what dictates a persons life and makes up who they are, essentially then you are entering into shirk and associating partners in worship in Allah, because you are saying because a person is born into a ""Caste"" that is what defines them and makes up who they are, when in Islam we don't believe in that and everyone is born Equal in that sense, and Allah is the only one who defines who you are as a Person.

Tribe is completely different, a tribe can have history of being ""Brave"" or generous and all that, but that doesn't make everyone in the tribe as a whole are the same, nor do they all share the same characteristic as what the Caste system implies, see you got to understand where the ""Caste"" System comes from, it all comes from the Hindus, and they also believe in Astrology  **Jyotisha.**

I don't know how a Muslim can believe in this Caste nonesense, i don't know how they are going to justify this to Allah on the day of judgement. When the origins and the roots of this ""Belief system"" Stems from Hinduism, it's pretty much adding astrology beliefs in to your tribe."

Be careful my sister, word's don't mean nothing with out actions to back it up, there are a lot of people out there that speak well about religion and all other matters, but this means nothing if there character doesn't match up with the words they speak. If they pray and have bad character that means that person needs to go back and reevaluate how they pray because you have to practice what you preach, the two go hand in hand, One compliments the other. Don't just be taken by a person's words and how much they know about the religion or poems etc, these are just words which mean nothing with out being proven (Actions).

Yes lowering the gaze works both ways, and a believer who fears Allah wouldn't eye out every single woman that walks past.

Looking at another woman in public, if he is eyeing them out and checking them out head to toe, that's a red flag and it's very disrespecting to be honest with, noticing something like that is very interesting because he seems to have everything you want, and you are taking away from his words and all that, but then you noticed something about his actions which stands out to you and rightly so, Maybe Allah SWT is showing you and making you notice something about this Brothers Character in which no words can hide the fact that he stares at women, this has made you sit back and ponder more and obviously questions aspects of this person.

The best thing you to do is be neutral right now about this person, feeling, emotions etc. Do istikhara and put your total faith in Allah SWT and let Allah SWT decide this outcome for you, even if its ends in heartbreak or whatever. Allah is the best in all our affairs and he only knows the true condition of a persons heart and there real intention.

So do your Istikhara for a few nights, then go and do what you planned on doing and if you notice these things again, best thing is to not even confront the person about it, then you are looking for that person to make an excuse for it, it's pretty much inexcusable to perv at other women while your out with the intention to get married. If your heart isn't at ease and you are fighting with it, then let it go.

&#x200B;

**The Sunnah tells us that the reward for memorising the names of Allah, may He be exalted, is admission to Paradise.** Al-Bukhaari (2736) and Muslim (2677) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúAllah has ninety-nine names. Whoever memorizes them will enter Paradise.‚Äù 

&#x200B;

The word translated as memorised in this hadeeth may include the following: 

&#x200B;

1.Memorising them

&#x200B;

2.Understanding their meanings

&#x200B;

3.Acting upon what they imply. So if a person knows that He is One, he will not associate anything else with Him; if he knows that He is the Provider, he will not seek provision from anyone else; if he knows that He is the Most Merciful, he will do acts of obedience that are a means of attaining this mercy‚Ä¶ And so on

&#x200B;

4.Calling upon Him by these names, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): ‚ÄúAnd (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them‚Äù \[al-A‚Äòraaf 7:180\]. So one may say for example, ‚ÄúO Most Gracious, have mercy on me; O Oft-Forgiving, forgive me; O Accepter of repentance, accept my repentance‚Äù and so on. Thus you will realise that it is not prescribed to merely recite these names without understanding them, acting upon them and calling upon Allah by them. 

&#x200B;

Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‚ÄòUthaymeen said: What is meant by memorising them is not merely writing them on a piece of paper, then repeating them until you have memorised them‚Ä¶

Did you just miss verse 82? Where Allah clearly states the state of their sin? **""practice  your lust on other men""** \- Clearly talking about homosexuality here, Yes they were known to be rapist as well but that is a different sin, what Allah is speaking of in this verse is clearly about homosexuality.

Further more the Prophet peace be upon him says,

**‚ÄúWhoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.‚Äù**   **al-Tirmidhi (1456)**

Now clearly when he means **""The actions of the people of loot""** it is homosexuality and to kill them and to the one whom it is done to.

Now if we take YOUR logic and understanding of the **""actions of the people of loot"" (Were you said they were killed because they were rapist as well which made the punishment more sever)** Then we have to add in the rape factor into this and to kill them right? but then the Hadith also says to kill the one the rapist raped?.....Does that make sense to you? Why would you kill the innocent victim of rape? That's not justice. So clearly the **""Actions of the people of Loot""** when the prophet Muhammad speaks about them is talking about homosexuality, what they were known for. (Yes they were rapist but the verse and story is **emphasizing homosexuality)**

So to summarize that, The prophet muhammad peace be upon him on that Hadith is backing up what Allah has done to the people of Loot - The homosexuals and it is to kill them. Simple as that, further more he curses these people.

**al-Tirmidhi (1456)**

**‚ÄúMay Allaah curse the one who does the action of the people of Loot, may Allaah curse the one who does the action of the people of Loot,‚Äù three times.**

**Ahmad (2915)**

>sexuality they are born with, rather Allah chooses.

This is completely false and very dangerous thing to say, you implying that Allah makes a person born gay? This is a contradiction to Islam because everyone is born sinless and in a pure state, if a person were to be born gay (A sin) then they are not born pure and sinless state. No where in the Islamic teaching does Allah says he makes people Gay or they are born that way, It's illogical to think that Allah will make a person born into a state of sin. (Now you are going into christian mentality original sin) Furthermore a person is not accountable for their actions and sins until they reach the age of maturity (physically and mentally). Why would Allah burden a person in a state of sin when they don't even know the world around them?

When it comes to Sins in Islam they are two categories, Minor and Major. Everything you do down gets written down in your book, so does your good deeds, they will be weighed up on the day of judgement and your fate is sealed. So the examples you gave, disrespecting parents, missing prayer etc, these are all sins and they are all being written down, so is homosexuality, but homosexuality is a major sin, so is missing your daily prayers.

&#x200B;

>an awful amount amount of people, including you and I, will go to hell.

You don't know if you will go heaven or hell that is with Allah, Allah has warned us of ways which will lead people into the fire and has shown us the straight path in how to get into heaven, so it's very easy if you just apply that understanding and learn, you chose your own fate, But a lot of people will go to hell. that the reality of it and our prophet muhammad peace be upon him reports about it in an hadith,

**It will be said: O Adam! Take out (collect) the Fire's group from your descendants!"" Adam will say: 'O my Lord! What is the Fire's group?' It will be said: 'From each 1000, 999. (It means that 999 human being will enter in the Hell (the Fire's group) and only one will go to the Paradise). And that is a day when the small child will become gray-haired and every pregnant female shall drop her load (unformed), you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, ‚Ä¶"" . \[Reported by Imams Bukhari and Muslim \].**

&#x200B;

>Now that doesn‚Äôt sound like an omnibenevolent God to me.

Again, it doesn't matter what you think, it is what Allah says in the Quran and if that doesn't fit your understanding of Allah, then you are rejecting what Allah has clearly stated in the Quran - If you reject something which is written in the Quran you reject all of it, Islam isn't something you can pick and chose to suit your own desires and understandings - this is clearly what you are doing, your understanding of Islam seems to be one of an emotional point of you rather it should be logical and rational, you don't follow Islam based on your own terms and desires, you follow Islam based on Allahs Terms and Allahs Desiries via his messengers and book.

He did make hell for a reason and people will be going in there like it or not - that is just and that is because Allah is  **""AL-HAKAM   The Judge, The Giver of Justice""** So if people deserve to go in there, they deserve it. Who are you to say they don't deserve it? Allah is the final judge and he knows whats in a persons heart and what they have done.

And just because Allah punishes people it doesn't make him less loving ( I don't know how any muslim can say that about Allah, that is straight out disrespectful - How can you call your self a muslim then insult Allah like that by not calling him loving?), actually he makes him more loving because he is doing justice to those people who have been wronged.

Allah, the one who has given you life and everything in this world and in the next, so if he chooses to punish you, then he has all the right to do so because you put yourself in that position.

Do not talk from the Islamic perspective if you have no knowledge of such things, this is very dangerous because you can be spreading and saying things about our religion (Allah and the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him) Which isn't true, so you are spreading false hood - This is a major sin. So clearly you are not speaking from the ""Islamic perspective"" rather you are speaking from your own desires and understanding, where you haven't even given a single verse backing your claims up. Allah warns us about this in the Quran,

 ***‚ÄúSay: The things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are al-Fawaahish (great evil sins, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority*** ***and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.‚Äù*** \[Surah Al-A‚Äôraaf: 33\] 

So next time you want to give your input on things brother, make sure you know what you are saying and they come from the teachings of Islam, because you are changing the religion in order to suit your beliefs. This is very dangerous.

&#x200B;

To clear something up, all sins are not equal, not all good deeds are equal, so saying that homosexuality and lying are the same is completely false and goes against the teaching of Islam and the Quran where Allah said in the Quran,

Surah Al - A'raf,

**80. And (remember) Loot (Lot), when he said to his people: ‚ÄòDo you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‚ÄòAalameen (mankind and jinn)?**

**81.¬†‚ÄòVerily, you practise your lusts on men instead of women. Nay, but you are a people transgressing beyond bounds (by committing great sins).‚Äô**

""Do you commit the worse sin"" Clearly Allah is saying that this is the worse sin, and he destroyed the people of that town after.

You don't owe him anything, if you do then it falls under interest - Which is a major sin in Islam as you know. When you do good for a person like buy them something, loan them money or do them a favor the intention should be pure and good, not to do it in order to get something in return, this defeats the purpose of the good deed. You do good for pleasing Allah, if you friend bought you that drink with the intention  for you to buy him a drink next time then that is interest. Technically he is loaning you the money (To buy the drink) in order for you to return the money in a form of a drink next time, you see how it works?

What's wrong with you man? Calling him ""insecure"" when he is giving her examples from the Islamic point of view on why he feels this way, he has the right to say things with out being insecure, if you think he is insecure then go back to the root source of his information would be the prophet peace be upon him, would you call him insecure? so be careful what you are saying because you are indirectly insulting not just him but our Prophet as well.

religion,fn2j9e1,t3_fyvv8q,1586591039.0,"Salaam,

Before i answer your questions lets understand something about Allah that you might not be aware of.

Allah has absolute power and knowledge over everything, meaning he knows what we don't know, past, present and future as well, the unseen and all that is out there. Allah has 99 names which are attributes of Allah, the 19th name is - **AL-‚ÄòALEEMThe All-Knowing, The Omniscient.** The One whose knowledge (ilm) is neither acquired through learning nor preceded by ignorance, nor followed by forgetfulness. He is aware of all things, even before they happen!""

Now that we have established that, let's start from **verse 65 of Surah Al Kahf**, the start of the story when Moses meets Khidir.

**65. Then they came upon a servant of Ours, whom We had blessed with mercy from Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our Own.**

Here Allah is saying the has blessed Khidir and taught him Knowledge, things which Allah knows, (Refer back to what that means the 19th name of Allah).  The story gives us 3 examples, **The Boat, The Wall, The Boy,** i will quickly explain what happens with each example to those of who are reading this and are unaware of this story in the Quran, Please note that Moses is following Khidir during this time is just observing what Khidir is doing and reacting to it, they first come across a boat,

&#x200B;

**The Boat.**

They first come across a boat, in the verse it explains what happens,

**71. So they set out. Until, when they had boarded the boat, he holed it. He said, ‚ÄúDid you hole it, to drown its passengers? You have done something awful.‚Äù**

So moses here thinks, Khidir is doing something terrible, to damage the boat to drown the people in it, later on Khidir explains why he done it,

**79. As for the boat, it belonged to paupers working at sea. I wanted to damage it because there was a king coming after them seizing every boat by force.**

So Khidir had knowledge (By Allah) That a King was coming and taking all the boats by force, so Khidir here damages the boat in away to make it look unusable so the king wouldn't take the boat but still could be repaired later on. Obviously the boat was a source of income and food for these people, so if a king came and took it these people would of had nothing, After Moses is told the reason, it makes sense to him.

&#x200B;

**The Wall.**

Then they enter a town, where they are offered hospitality (That was the custom during that time when a passer would enter a town the people of the town would offer them some sort of hospitality, in this instance they didn't, Khidir repairs a wall which is about to collapse and Moses doesn't understand why, as the verse says,

**77. So they set out. Until, when they reached the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. There they found a wall about to collapse, and he repaired it. He said, ‚ÄúIf you wanted, you could have obtained a payment for it.‚Äù**

Moses says you could of taken payment for it, in the later verse, Khidir explains why he repaired the wall even though the people of the town didn't show them any hospitality,

**82. And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the city. Beneath it was a treasure that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man. Your Lord wanted them to reach their maturity, and then extract their treasure‚Äîas a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it of my own accord. This is the interpretation of what you were unable to endure.‚Äù**

Here Clearly Khidir is saying that this isn't from his own accord, he is doing something which he is told to do when he says **""I did not do it of my own accord""** the knowledge of the wall and treasure all came from Allah, in order to preseve the treasure behind the wall he had to repair it, so the orphans will get what belongs to them, it is pretty clear after reading verse 82.

&#x200B;

**The boy.**

Then they come across a boy,

**74. Then they set out. Until, when they encountered a boy, he killed him. He said, ‚ÄúDid you kill a pure soul, who killed no one? You have done something terrible.‚Äù**

Here Moses doesn't understand what is going on, he is assuming that the boy is innocent, but Khidir had the knowledge of Allah and knew that this boy later will oppress his parents and cause them into disbelief, Oppression is a Major sin in Islam. Khidir explains this in the verse,

**80. As for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared he would overwhelm them with oppression and disbelief.**

**81. So we wanted their Lord to replace him with someone better in purity, and closer to mercy.**

Now according to the tasfir of Ibn Kathir, on this matter the prophet peace be upon him said:

**(The Boy Al-Khidir killed was destined to be a disbeliever from the day he was created.)**

It was recorded by Ibn Jarir from Ibn Abbas. He said: His parents were believers, and we feared he would oppress them by rebellion and disbelief) their love for him might make them follow him in disbelief. Qatadah said, **‚ÄúHis parents rejoiced when he was born and grieved for him when he was killed. If he had stayed alive, he would have been the cause of their doom.** So let a man be content with the decree of Allah, for the decree of allah for the believer, if he dislikes it, is better for him than if he were to decree that he likes for him. An authentic hadith says ( Allah does not decree anything for the believer expect it is good for him) and Allah says: And if be that you dislike a thing which is good for you)

So Allah is protecting the believers from something which is out of their knowledge, something which isn't even in their scope of understanding - that their son who they love and adore one day would oppress them and cause them into disbelief, this shows you the clear decree of Allah when Allah knows whats best for anyone. This boy, pain and simple was going to grow up to be evil, that's as simple as that, the knowledge was passed down to Khidir and he acted on it. That was the decree of Allah and that protected the believers.

&#x200B;

If you still can't understand that, then ill give you an example, Say you were alive when hitler was a boy, and God told you that one day this boy Hitler will end up murdering millions upon millions of people on this earth, and there is nothing that will change that, you can't talk sense to him you can't do anything, this is exactly what is going to happen, the only way to protect those innocent people is to kill Hitler there and then, Would you do it in order to prevent the death of millions of people? Of course you would if you knew what Hitler would of done, Now saying that millions of people don't compare to 2 people right (The boys parents? Wrong, in Islam we say just like the Jews say as well, **""If you were to save one life it is like you have saved all of humanity""**

The reality of the world we live in is that evil exists, and people are evil, not everyone is all lovely dovely and compassionate and sweet, there are evil people in this world and they do oppress and hurt others and spread corruption, Why? Because they chose to do these things, they don't simply care, so how can you say these people deserve anything good in their lives or in the after life after they have caused so much harm to others? That isn't justice. Those people who sit back and watch others commit oppression and justices to other people are to blame as well, so having this thinking where we are all lovey dovey and everyone deserves to be forgiven even if they commit such evil acts in this world is complete nonsense, no society in this world we ever survive if they just allowed criminals to get away with whatever they did, and the punishment fits the crime. If it's jail then its jail, if its a fine then its a fine, if its death then its death.

and that's exactly whats in the after life, heaven and hell. How you conduct yourself in this world determines the after life as Allah said in the Quran - In Surah Al Kahf as well,

**7. We made what is upon the earth an ornament for it, to test them as to which of them is best in conduct.**

What do you think about this you rude person? You want me to sink down to your level?

You know you can have a conversation on reddit with out being so condescending. I am aware that women go out in public and walk amongst the human population.

Going out in public to the shops is different when your intention isn't there to attract people to stop and stare at you, when platforms like Instagram are built around that - Images, comment, like etc.

Parading your looks on a platform such as instrgram enables the viewer to do things in the comfort of their own homes, which they cant get away with in public, we are talking about a mans perspective here. You are aware what people do in the privacy of their own homes right? Let me ask you a question, when was the last time you saw a man drop his pants in public as a hijabi sister walk past him?...yeah thought so. Men do this all the time in the privacy of their own homes, so to compare the two aspects of society as if they are the same and people behavior the same just shows how ignorant you are of this world.

Our religion of islam is very clear on these things but yet we still have muslims people here defending it and saying that it is ok, and there isn't nothing wrong about it or that it is ""unavoidable and we can't do much about it""

This can be seen in Quran. when Quran calls the prophet Ibrahim a Hanif Muslim:

>Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim \[submitting to Allah\]. And he was not of the polytheists.

In this verse the two words Hanif (ÿ≠ŸÜ€åŸÅ) and Muslim (ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ) are used for describing prophet Ibrahim a.s. this translator has translated the word Hanif to ""one inclining toward truth"".

According to Islamic sources although most of Arabs were polytheists but prophet Muhammad SAWW and his fathers (who are children's of prophet Ibrahim a.s. and Ismael a.s.) never have been polytheists and all have been monotheists. all the genealogy line from Ibrahim a.s. to Muhammad SAWW have been believers and monotheists.

Please note although Muhammad SAWW started preaching Islam at age 40 but this does not mean he himself did not know anything about Islam before it. he was practicing Islam from when he was child and never committed any sin all over his life and if he did not preach Islam publicly before 40 it was for political conditions of that time and if he preached Islam before the suitable conditions and before finding enough secret supporters he would be killed by polytheist state King and state and culture and people of that time and so never could preach Islam. when he started preaching he and his supporters were kept under sanctions and were enforced to live out of city without have any right to buy or sell anything and the polytheists tries to kill him many tiems and after having many fights and wars with polytheists who their boss was Abu Sufyan finally Muslims after many years could conquer Mecca the base of polytheists without war.

Plenty of more examples in the bible used in many texts, so if we go by the christian understanding of sons of gods then there would be many ""Gods"" in the bible.

When the Greeks/Romans took the religion of the Jews at that time, there understanding of gods was many gods, so of course to them when they saw that phrase in the bible it got them excited - mixed their mythology into the religion of the Jews and hence the understanding of ""Jesus"" being the literal son of god was born, this concept of the trinity came 300 years after the death of Jesus."

Majority of the scholars would consider this marriage invalid because of that intent you have.

Divorce is something which is disliked in Islam, we call this sort of arrangement where i come from (Merry old Australia) ""Root and boot"" but in this case the woman is also agreeing to it, which is strange. Usually the brothers don't tell of the booting until it happens. 

Look man getting married just for sex, the moment you do it you will want to divorce straight away or until the ""Fun"" dies out. Believe me, learn to control yourself and find someone you honestly have feelings for and want to marry with no intention of divorce, Marry a person not just for sex and desire but all aspects of what an Islamic marriage should be and can be.

Learn to control yourself, i know its hard but it's not the end of the world. You are allowing your emotions to dictate the decisions in your life right now and you will regret it later on, try to think rationally here my brother.

Wearing the Hijab is Taqwa, and an act of worship, so how can you say they are the same? 

**The Prophet (ÿµŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸäŸá Ÿàÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ) said, ‚ÄúThe most common thing which leads people to Paradise is taqwa of Allah and good conduct, and the most common thing which leads people to the Hell Fire is the mouth and the private parts.‚Äù \[Tirmidhi\]**

I wish people actually understood the religion of Islam before saying such things. When it comes to ""Better"" it doesn't matter what we think it only matters what Allah SWT thinks of us, so yes there is a difference between a person who wears the hijab and doesn't wear the hijab, Allah is the final judge.

To say that wearing the hijab is the same as a sister who doesn't wear the hijab is complete nonsense and insulting, wearing the hijab is an act of worship and showing a persons Taqwa of Allah which you get good deeds for, compared to a sister who doesn't wear it, not wearing the hijab is going against what Allah SWT has commanded in the Quran, so you are sinning. Do you actually think the one sinning is equal to the one who isn't? What she saying is completely disrespectful to the sisters who struggle to wear the hijab everyday but do it out of the fear of Allah.

Wearing the hijab isn't an easy thing especially in this day and age where sisters are attacked for wearing it and all that drama that comes with wearing it, compared to a sister who doesn't wear it. So comparing the two as if they are equal is complete disrespect.

Spreading this womans opinion on the matter is dangerous and foolish, big deal she was on vogue and she is beautiful, that doesn't give a person the right to say wrong things about Islam, even if its her own opinion. We as Muslims should correct a Muslim when they say ignorant and such dangerous things especially if they have a podium like vogue to express their opinions, and we should call out those who are spreading their ignorance as well.

The only time a Muslim is better then another Muslim is when it comes to Taqwa, that is the reality, there are 7 heavens and there are many rewards for the deeds that you do and wearing the HIJAB is one of them, the prophet peace be upon him said,

Ahmad (22978) narrated from Abu Nadrah: Someone who heard the khutbah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the second of the days of at-Tashreeq told me that he said: ‚ÄúO people, verily your Lord is One and your father is one. **Verily there is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab or of a non-Arab over an Arab, or of a red man over a black man, or of a black man over a red man, except in terms of taqwa**. Have I conveyed the message?‚Äù They said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has conveyed the message.

Clearly the prophet says there is a difference.

People ask why are Muslims so misguided, ignorant about their own religion, it's because we allow such rubbish opinions like this persons one to spread and take it as fact, not all of us will take it as fact but those who don't understand their religion will.

So guess what people, there is a difference when it comes to a sister who wears the hijab and doesn't wear the hijab ( i am only comparing those two aspects of the person on how they practice the faith).

And if you people don't understand what i am on about i will make it clearer for you, let me take her opinion and rephrase it the first part of it which i disagree with. It's like she just said this,

**""Praying"" doesn't make a Muslim any better or worse than another Muslim who doesn't Pray""**

May Allah guide her."

You said,

>The breaking point for me was when I found out that he was messaging (even flirting) with other girls - and he ended up blaming me saying I have trust issues

This is not the actions of a person who isn't taking marriage seriously, this is the actions of a hypocrite. As soon as you found this out you should of left this person on the spot, this is something which is unforgivable and inexcusable - Especially if you are engaged, you dodged a bullet.

You sound like a loyal person, and what you were asking in this marriage agreement was very reasonable and fair. Often i hear sisters who go through stuff like this and get married, few months later they either divorce or they stay in a toxic relationship, you saw red flags and some red flags are inexcusable especially when it comes to loyalty.

Look it's good that he was teaching you religious things, but he should of used some of that knowledge on himself, Character is something which is the one of the most upmost things in Islam, you know we hear a lot of people say that ""This person prays 5 times a day"" Well if that's so and their character is poor they need to go back and check if they are praying right. Iman (Faith) and Character go hand in hand, one complements the other.

Anyways look, i know he was the first guy you got to know and all this razzle dazzle stuff, just forget all that, it wasn't meant to be and there were many red flags. As you said your personality is strong and you don't give up easily on things - this is a very quality to have for a person, but he didn't deserve it.

Allah protected you from this person, be thankful that you saw the persons true side before you guys actually got married and you were stuck in an toxic relationship.

A lot of people have knowledge when it comes to Islam, but what use is knowledge when you don't use it in the right way and don't use to to better yourself and others around you. My advice for you my sister is learn the religion yourself, seek knowledge so the next time you meet a brother you can tell whats what when it comes to their ""religious commitments"" because of hypocrite will say a lot of things and act the opposite.

Salaam. :)"

MuslimMarriage,flsuvr2,t3_fqxy0g,1585451402.0,">  I feel like there‚Äôs no point of me trying to become religious again as I‚Äôve committed one of the biggest sins 

This sort of thinking is from the devil, he is the one making you over think it and doubting that Allah SWT hasn't forgiven you, just because you committed a major sins doesn't mean you can't be religious anymore. You are doubting yourself - stop it. What was done was done, you feel guilt and regret from doing those sins, that's a sign of a believer this is a good thing, if you were not to feel guilty and regretful of those actions, you wouldn't be here today talking about it.

Make  **Tawba**  to Allah and truly ask for forgiveness and never do that act again. You are now getting married and things are looking good for you, inshallah you can get back on the path. 

No ones past is perfect, don't dwell on things you can not change anymore, move on from them and start the new chapter in your life which is marriage and inshallah the road back to the path of being religious. 

Here understand how Tawba works in Islam and you will see that Inshallah Allah SWT has forgiven your sins.

MuslimMarriage,flpeu2s,t3_fq97ou,1585357827.0,"Never came across a brother who was so vocal about not having a child, quite strange thing to hear to be honest with you especially if you know the blessing that a child will bring you in this world and when you die,

Abu Qatadah, rahimahullah, reported that Allah's Messenger, sallallahu 'alayhiwasallam, said:

""Among the good deeds that continue to benefit a believer after death are: a knowledge that he taught and disseminated, **a righteous child who lived after him**, a Qur'an book that he left as inheritance, a masjid that he built, a house that he built for the two wayfarers, a stream that he ran, or a charity that he gave from his wealth during his healthy lifetime so that it would reach him (in rewards) after death.""

Nothing wrong with a person having a big nose, i don't find it less attractive, or even having small lips or whatever ""imperfections"" you might think you have, it's actually nice seeing a normal face in this day and age, when everyone is walking around with plastic noses, filtered lips, fake cheeks and whatever. I actually appreciate and respect a woman more when she doesn't go and do those things and is content with what Allah has made her to be. Not all us brothers will reject you on those grounds and if they do, well it's their loss and to be honest they are quite foolish.

Outward appearance is just outward appearance, what really matters is the inward self, when you find a person who has has great eman and conducts themselves as a Muslim with their character, speech and actions everything else about them elevates more and you see the real beauty in them. You just haven't come across a person like that yet, but soon you will inshallah.

Dont focus to much on it, why would you want a person who only wants beauty? when as you said you have all these other things you value, to me the are much better then having a smaller nose.
