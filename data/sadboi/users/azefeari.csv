I did manage to shout in between songs.... I didn’t give it any thought. Kyo seemed extremely into it though. I don’t know if I was hearing it right but at one point near the beginning kyo kept saying “LUCIFER SENT YOU.” I do know someone said the crowd failed to follow a queue to sing along.  Maybe he wasn’t pleased, I think he flicked the crowd off in the end, but it seemed like just a rogue middle finger. In the end he sincerely bowed and glanced slowly over the crowd. Then only the guitarist with the wind blowing in his hair stuck around a little longer. Non chalantly just looking at the crowd, and tossing his water on them. I wasn’t close enough to get sprinkled. I threw up a heart sign toward him and idk if he saw it but he looked in my direction right before he turned around I think. So that’s all, I think low vibe crowds are just really shy, that’s how it is for me."
