OP, I weaned my first at four months and my second at six, because the guidance changed. Both are now strong, healthy, sporty, kindhearted teens. BLW wasn't a thing then so we used purees. First food is about baby trying stuff unless Dr advises otherwise (my friend had a right chonker who was hungry all the time and needed solids to bulk up his diet!) so don't sweat it too much.

Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 
1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped 
1 leek finely chopped 
2 stalks of celery finely chopped 
4 cloves of garlic finely chopped 
1 Head of cauliflower white part only cut into florets 
1 litre of chicken stock (hot) 
Dash white wine 
100g Cheddar 
100g cream cheese
50ml double (whipping) cream
4 rashers of streaky bacon (grilled til crisp) 
Small bunch chives chopped fine 

Method:

Get a decent sized heavy bottomed saucepan. Heat the butter and olive oil, add the onion and sweat this gently for quite a long time - about 10 mins, the longer cook is worth it. Then add the leek, celery and garlic and sweat for a couple minutes more.

Add the cauliflower, season with salt and pepper, and add the stock. Bring to the boil and simmer until cauliflower is tender (about 15 mins). Turn off the heat. Add the cream cheese, Cheddar and cream and stir in. Blend with a stick blender until smooth. Top with bacon and chives.

My nMum said it all the time and now my nBrother does too. The thing is, I've been to a lot of therapy and worked through some things so as to he aware of it, so I don't treat my kids the same way, and my husband and people who know me say I'm not like them
My brother however is a total narc and is doing to his kids and wife exactly what our dad did to us."
