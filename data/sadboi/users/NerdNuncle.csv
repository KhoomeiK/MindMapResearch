LONG VERSION: For some reason, the school board decided to set all the clocks inside all buildings five minutes ahead. The school time applied to everyone and everything.

Now, there was another rule that students serving detention had to be picked up by 4:20, or the student in question would automatically get another detention. Because their parents were late.

I was waiting outside after serving (don’t ask) and only myself and the (un)lucky teacher. My old man pulls up at 4:19 (normal time) and we take off.

The next morning I was slapped with another detention and my parents were notified because they had picked me up at 4:29 school time.


For those wondering, I never served it, because my dad drove over and demanded an explanation. Teacher called the cops on him. Responding cop also had a child in that same school and was never made aware of that particular rule. So naturally aforementioned teacher made nasty comments about both men well-within earshot.

One emergency school board meeting later, the rule was dropped. The school time remains the same"

With Snart, it was the actor’s choice to leave. While personally I still never quite got over that, at least Mick Rory and his actor got a chance to step out of their counterpart’s shadow. If that makes sense.

Laurel’s case, however, boils down to raw spite. She’s been in the comics for decades, Cassidy was starting to redeem the character, Lance was supposed to get her own story arc, and then killed off in the most lazily written way possible. 

To add insult to injury, a character magically possessing Laurel’s powers, law enforcement background, and personality but not portrayed by Katie Cassidy was brought in. 

Not to mention Laurel’s doppelgänger was made insanely weaker when transplanted to Arrow. She went from going toe-to-toe with Flash and being able to topple skyscrapers to being bested by Felicity Smoak and only capable of mild concussive blasts.

1.) Dr. Strange and Nebula do nothing to help while the heroes almost win the day. Nebula does however, gladly exposit to an emotionally compromised Peter Quill causing him to do a bad.

2.) Gamora knows Thanos needs her for some nefarious purpose. Doesn’t try to act on it until Thanos has arrived and it’s too late 

3.) The first Thor movie establishes Sif and the Warriors Three to be his closest friends. Yet he doesn’t even ask as to their whereabouts IIRC

4.) IIRC Hulk crashes through the ceiling of the NYC Sanctum Santorum. I have a really hard time buying no one took any precautions against that, especially after the events of the Dr. Strange movie.


Related to the above, wtf did Thor hand over the keys to New Asgard to Valkyrie, whom he couldn’t have known for more than a decade, as opposed to at the very least asking Sif, whom he’s known for centuries? (“Endgame”)"
