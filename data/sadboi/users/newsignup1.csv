Girl who was failing her apprenticeship and who’s parents also worked for the same company and acted like the mafia decided that their daughter was perfect and it must be someone else’s fault I.e mine. 

Won’t go into it in detail as it still gets me but basically her mum wrote a letter the the top of the company explaining how I’d abused her daughter and caused her health issues that would be with her a lifetime. 

I was suspended pending enquiry 

Dragged around various neutral grounds to be interrogated by HR 

I received support from only one person I worked with, the company kept everything quiet as it would cause major shit if it leaked out 

No one gave a shit what was happening to me 

I ended up leaving basically my dream job id worked for 10 years as she continued to swan around the work place like nothing had happened and I couldn’t be alone in any room with her yet she sought to make that situation happen. 

I ended up winning the battle after a someone from HR smelled a rat and went to town on her getting her to confess but the damage was done. 

And to top this off.... 

Before the accusation came in I’d never spoke or dealt with the person involved. What a fucking bitch."
