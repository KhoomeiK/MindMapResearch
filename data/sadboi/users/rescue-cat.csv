I know its alot of waste, but i don’t have the space to fully compost all my cats waste for so long cause i grow food in the backyard and my front yards small. I only put her poop in a worm bin because its less smelly than throwing it in the bin in my room cause in the worm bin it gets covered in paper and gets eaten, but in the garbage bin the whole room smells whenever it opens. I dont like throwing her poop in a seperate plastic bag and also dont want to carry it across the house to the outdoor bin. I use pine litter btw."
