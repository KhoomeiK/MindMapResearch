I believe they're the only people who can refer me too, since there are no specialists in the area. It's just a general doctors office and I've always had issues with them. Im sick and I'm tired of dealing with them so I do not want to bother cause they basically make me feel like I'm a massive waste of time."

I've still got their support email, I'll try sending another query and hope for the best. Was hesitant to do so in case of getting put on a spam mailer list or something dumb like that."
