I’ve missed two doses this week on accident (so much traveling and family obligations) and I ended up having sleep paralysis and stressful dreams such to the point that I had to pull out the good ole weighted blanket because I couldn’t stop shaking and my heart was beating so fast and wouldn’t stop after I’d woken up. Feeling mega dizzy like my brain is floating around all willy-nilly in my head. I’m not tapering off until the end of the month but if this is any indication of how it’s gonna go, I’m not excited. 

Are you still experiencing symptoms now that it’s been a week?"
ntbdbiwdfta,fc7d0bj,t3_eglg4m,1577503828.0,"I should clarify: I found her on the Petfinder app. She had one photo. Her foster mom had only just posted one updated photo of her that was so cute and that’s all it took to get my attention! I found out she had been abused in the past, and it took a few months of me helping her back to a relaxed state so she could sit still for a photo. She is now a little model and so so happy. It’s incredible how important pet photography is—I have thought about starting a platform to help connect budding photographers with local shelters. All of you working as foster parents and documenting your foster pets on Instagram are doing such an amazing thing. We live in a digital age, and your ground efforts to find these darlings homes is so so incredibly important.🙏🏻"

It’s totally something that people feel, particularly those with BPD. I would do anything to exist less, if that makes sense. Sleeping all day, laying on the couch staring at the ceiling from the moment I got home from work til 2 am, it’s all stuff we do and you’re not weird whatsoever. I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way, I know how inescapable and suffocating it feels to be trapped into living. I sometimes still feel that way on occasion, and I wish I had sound advice for making it go away. Just know you’re not alone in your pain, and it’ll eventually stop happening someday. Ask your doctor about Effexor, I feel like that’s really the only medication that ever helped me get out of those super dark spots.

BPD,fbg18cq,t3_ed51tu,1576829314.0,"I feel for you so much. Sometimes leaving simply isn’t an option, and I respect that. It’s your choice to make. But I do hope that someday you do have the means and the will to walk away. The important thing is you recognize what’s happening. The very basis of gaslighting (a narcissist’s favorite mechanism for control) is convincing the victim that they are imagining these abusive patterns. Remind yourself that your narrative is just as valid. Call them out, ask for specifics when they accuse you of things. Ask follow-up questions. Gaslighters make a lot of generalizations (“you’re always ruining my day” or “you always start fights” etc.) they HATE IT because it forces them down from their position of power and puts them into a vulnerable spot. Most importantly, it shows that you are paying attention. Make sure they know that you believe in your own truth, and that their side of the story doesn’t have any effect on your side of the story and what you believe to be true. Narcissists are nasty but if you stand your ground with them, I’ve found that they tend to back off. 

Now this is all assuming they aren’t hurting you or threatening you. If that’s happening, please tell your doctor. That’s a whole other scenario that requires much more strategy and care. 

I really hope you are able to find a way out. Don’t let somebody hold your diagnosis against you. Remember that BPD is caused by trauma...you did absolutely nothing wrong, you are a human who deserves to be loved and treated with respect, and you have already proven your strength by surviving your trauma."

EDAnonymous,fb8cn08,t3_ebo427,1576611016.0,Maybe unrelated but I feel like fitness influencers on Insta often have similar stories. “I used to be afraid of gaining weight but now I WANT TO BC GAINZ” not shaming them but imho bodybuilding should also be considered an eating disorder at a certain point. There’s so much obsessing that goes into it and it is a lifestyle thing that takes over every facet of your life. Why do we glamorize it so much? Literally I had a more forgiving diet when I had anorexia than when I went paleo and started working out. At least back then I was allowed to have Parmesan cheese. As someone in recovery who shifted from anorexic to “I work out daily and only eat bird food” I have to say...I see no difference other than people’s acceptance of this lifestyle as opposed to my previous one. Still obsessing over food/diet/exercise. Still filled with self-loathing. Still body dysmorphic. Only difference is I have an ass now. Wtf.

BPD,fb89z0m,t3_ebzcld,1576609361.0,"Honestly I think it comes down to intentions. Do you lie for self-preservation from a fear of being punished unfairly? Or do you lie because...it’s just natural to you and there really isn’t a reason? 

I think it’s important to make the distinction. Self-preservation is a sensation that is directly related to brain chemistry and trauma. I can’t fault you for feeling the need to come up with an elaborate story about why something happened if you have a fear in your head that you will somehow be harmed or unfairly punished. I try not to lie, but if I feel like my boyfriend might hurt me if I didn’t clean the apartment (he wouldn’t, but my mom would have) I would definitely embellish if I felt it necessary to my safety. 

Nothing is black and white. I don’t think anybody but you can say if lying is wrong. Ask yourself why you do it, what goes through your head, what you feel, etc. It is not at all outside of the realm of possibility that your compulsive lying stems from a fight or flight response."
