Of course she's not gonna diagnose them. I was the one who already suspected my father may fall on the spectrum (I'm quite sure) but didn't understand the implications. My therapist then concluded that both of my parents show traits and it would explain my attachment issues and their behaviour. It's about me, not them.

Even if I end up with a degree, working would definitely become a problem. Or I should switch to something different, but that's also hard work. Or go down the welfare route, but I've heard they're very strict.

But you're right that it can get better once I start therapy (hopefully very soon) and that I should ask to be accommodated in any case. Even if that's not solving the problem entirely. You're right that I shouldn't be burning myself out"
