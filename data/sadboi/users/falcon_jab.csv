I believe the story is about mental illness, and nothing else. Or at least, it has to be, to be a successful story. The fact that it manages to make you think it might also be about “shamanic powers” even though it’s not (in my opinion) is what would make it absolutely phenomenal storytelling, it puts you in the shoes of Alma and makes you believe her delusions along with her. The open-ended finale is part of that too. We’re left with the same uncertainty as a sufferer.

UndoneTV,fejidc1,t1_fecocfb,1579175575.0,"I initially thought that the show was purely about mental illness after I finished it, and the “higher dimensional thinking” aspect of it was purely a way of showing the hardened beliefs of someone stuffing from it. Because how else would you portray that certainty of belief in a tv show?

But the other more fascinating aspect of it is indeed the exploration of “what is reality anyway?” - the reality/perception of that we all consider as “the normal” is only “normal” because it’s the way the vast majority of humanity perceives the world.

Now, not to say that means that time travel etc is possible via these “shamanic paths” or whatever, but it’s a way of explaining that some people will interpret “whatever fundamental reality actually is” in a much more roundabout way. Which is what I imagine having schizophrenia must feel like. You’re perceiving exactly the same reality as everyone else, but telling the story a different way, I guess.

Alma in the show, I’m assuming, uses these ideas of time travel and shamans as a means to explore her deeper trauma and to try and gain resolution.

I suppose what you’re getting at is that thinking that way is labelled “wrong” and “dangerous” simply because it doesn’t mesh well with the larger society the “normals” have built up (though each and every one of the “normals” also perceives reality on subtly or massively different ways)

I deeply hope there’s no “actual time travel” involved in the show, and that it remains grounded in “fundamental reality” but continues to explore that reality in a much more fluid way."
