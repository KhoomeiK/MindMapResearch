So you're telling me that you think that having training and fulfilling a specific role qualifies you to be a narcissist? Shall we automatically classify all organists as narcissists as well because they are trained to do something that everyone else can't? 

A narcissist is someone who is obsessed with their own personal needs and is incapable of valuing anyone else except as to how that person fulfills their needs. What's your definition of narcissist?

In my branch of Christianity the clergy have received an extensive education in philosophy, theology, counseling, and oration. They are given a special blessing that allows them to perform 3 rituals on behalf of everyone. Their primary role is to teach people how to talk to God themselves. 

They are still human. They still have the same problems. They still put their trousers on one leg at a time just like everyone else. They are not necessarily better at talking to God than a lay person and God does not talk to them alone.

My branch of Christianity is one of the largest and does not have particularly unique beliefs.
