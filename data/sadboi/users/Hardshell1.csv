I asked a family member to hold onto mine and his until I could get to a place where I could have them. My grandfather passed away shortly after, and that family member took advantage of my grandfathers will being missing to go to court and take everything he could, effectively leaving me destitute, essentially. We’re still recovering from that, but we didn’t have the money to fight for anything, including the guns, and I doubt we ever will."
