My preference of a grocery store is rather complex but I'll try to keep it simple. Tourism loses its business twice a year in my region, once as the snow melts and once as summer turns into frigid autumn. That's hard when you barely make enough to survive.  Also in hotels you're basically just a pawn for someone above you to make more money, and if anything happens that can risk them not making their money, they scream at you.  And ultimately,  money. A grocery store pays more per hour than a hotel and offers better opportunities for grown and promotion than a hotel does. My position is on the floor, I stock shelves and milk.

And it's a shame but if she wont listen to reason, then call the cops. Let them catch her before she kills herself or someone else. Fines, lost license, lost vehicle, and forced into an alcohol program where you're taught about alcohol etc. 2 friends of mine both got caught and said it was the best wake up call they could ever ask for. If that jeopardizes the relationship, so be it, put safety of everyone ahead of your desire for a wedding. If she cant see that you do it out of love, then let her go.  She probably needs therapy. Offer her the opportunity to tell you whatever she needs to talk about, and if she prefers a private convo with a therapist then you'll help her set that up. I've been through the drugs and booze and then through years of therapy and medications and it really does help but is hard to stay on track with it all.

AskReddit,f5e4ha7,t1_f5at913,1572164656.0,"Yes. I wish I was informed as a child of proper care, if I knew I had to pull back the skin regularly, I could have stretched it enough to avoid phymosis. But I'm the first boy in my family not circumcised at birth (hospitals in the years around my birth refused to complete the operation due to saving costs and me not being jewish) and so my parents never knew the foreskin ever had to be pulled back at all. Otherwise, theres methods of stretching it later in life, not recommended by doctors but still possibly useful that I wish I tried first. But doctors never explained that I would lose significant feeling (much of the nerves are in the foreskin and frenulum, and the glans and Corona when exposed long term will dry, harden and lose their nerve function as the exterior is no longer moist and protected..) and the surgeon who did my surgery failed to detail the risks prior to my operation. I did seek legal help but Canada has strict rules around legal action against medical personnel and my likelyhood of winning was diminished as such, so I could not get legal representation as all lawyers I phoned refused to take my case. I regret my circumcision more than anything else I've ever done in my life and I can never fix it to the way it was. It still affects my relationship to this day and should my gf ever leave me, I would not have the confidence to attempt intercourse with any new person who may come into my life. My partners support for me is outstanding and she is the reason I try. And to be honest I was spiraling into a deep depression around when this surgery took place, it destroyed my confidence and I was planning to kill myself. I wrote in a book about how I wanted to die and when. I later burned that book with my gf when she and i became truly close, to signify my promise to try my best to stick around in her life. That was over 2.5 years ago I burned that book, and it's been almost 6 years since the surgery. My life will never be the same and I nearly died as a result of the emotional and physical changes that surgery brought about. So yeah... tl;dr I regret circumcision"
AskReddit,f5asyc6,t3_dnha2m,1572113099.0,"Ok it's weird. My foreskin was too tight so it was removed. 6 years later I still get uncomfortable feelings from the glans and corona against my boxers on hot days, I cant figure out how to not get toilet paper stuck to it after a piss, and surprisingly the tight foreskin redirected my piss stream downward so my first few weeks of pissing sans-foreskin resulted in the piss going up and missing the toilet. Had to learn to aim all over again. As for sex, I lost all sensation. A combination of a bad surgery and emotional and physical trauma from that surgery is to blame. Even if I could feel something, the stress of that operation would be enough to ruin the experience. My first time having sex months later I was so disappointed! But eventually I found the girl of my dreams and I had sex despite not feeling anything. After a year or two of that, I actually orgasmed for the first time during sex. It took therapy, specialists, using a toy to practice stimulating the newly exposed regions, and ultimately finding comfort and safety and trust in my partner. But now I orgasm about 50-70% of the time, and I feel at least a little something now and again. My life is permanently altered but I'm getting by. Just takes a hell of a lot of convincing to make a girl believe she is not the problem when the guy cant cum during sex. Sometimes women may feel unable to satisfy their men, I always remind my partner that it's how my body works now and not a reflection of the experience she gave me. It really makes me take my relationship even more seriously"

Let's be honest here it sounds like some of your friends got into it all a little young in my opinion, and you seem to feel some pressure to be like that. Virginity is something you want to lose in a special way, with a special person. Sex is awkward and uncomfortable the first time, but is going to be one of the moments you remember, when it happens. Don't worry, your time will come eventually and as long as you are safe and trust the other person, you'll enjoy yourself. I lost mine at 16, but honestly it was pretty messed up and I kinda regret it, turns out I wasnt really into that partner so much, but the sex made me stick around with her for 11 months or so. But I have friends who lost their virginity well into their 20s and even 30s.

CasualConversation,f518egz,t3_dmia49,1571938378.0,"Hey I moved out at 18, went away for college, and tried to start my life. It wasnt the easiest start, and i left behind a lot of people too, but heres how my experience went:    I was unmotivated by the prospective outcome of my own education, and no other career choices seemed to appeal to me. But the experience of moving away and trying to find a path in my life was great overall. I learned exactly what I disliked in the world and in people, and as a result found some things I did like. Took years to master the workings of taxes, I moved constantly, worked multiple jobs, eventually ended up in an entirely different place. Made some big mistakes, poor choices, met some amazing people (most of whom came and went, but some are still in my life today) and I started and terminated my career. I even met the love of my life. I still find myself spending days alone and unproductive, but it's okay. I've taken to doing regular therapy since my depression and anxiety disorders are troublesome, and my ADHD and OCD make things a little more difficult still. The biggest lesson I learned: stop being so serious. Be serious enough to ensure you can eat and keep warm, but beyond that, follow your heart. I quit my career in luxury hotels and began working in a grocery store, and I've never been happier. It's not the most challenging job by any means, but it keeps me busy, active and interacting with people of all varieties. My colleagues are the nicest people I've ever met and I'm learning more about who I am and who I want to be. Sure many people probably think I could be ""doing much better"" by choosing another big busy career or making more money, but my happiness is number 1. Dont sacrifice happiness for wealth or status. Ensure some form of stability so you can survive and then work upwards from there, keeping happiness in mind. You're likely going to have many more days stuck in your room, but you will find yourself and your groove. Make mistakes, learn, grow. I had low points, but I'm back and better than ever. Not perfect but eh it's pretty damn close. Good luck my dude!"

AskReddit,f512b6r,t3_dmif71,1571936242.0,"I cant feel sex very often, and I'm just trying to think about how to deal with this. Been my whole life and I just cant seem to find my groove, haha fuck eh"
sex,f511hnq,t3_dmif8v,1571935918.0,"Its unconventional but glad you're open and honest about that. Theres always risk of pregnancy despite every precaution that could be taken, so be sure that before sex you also both agree on the terms of what would happen should pregnancy occur, be it abortion, or give birth, support financially from both parents in that event, etc etc. With my partner we use condoms and all that stuff but that's still a discussion we had early on. Cover all your bases, and be open to sex with a condom if you're into her but she wont go without it. Condoms really suck and I agree I cant feel fuck all with one, but the greatest risk is to her health given the whole baby-carrying thing, so her choice is final aha"
AskReddit,f50z4f2,t3_dmifdt,1571935035.0,"Pretty wild for me haha I kept shouting at the docs and nurses ""you're fucking awesome"" but i see one guy taller than the others and yell ""you're a fucking idiot"". Also kept pulling off my pulse monitor another time. That nurse hated me. I have some other cloudy memories, I've had lots of surgeries so anesthesia is a regular thing for me haha"
AmItheAsshole,f50xctr,t3_dmigr3,1571934313.0,"You're NTA but perhaps theres some different things to try... I know a married couple where the wife said the husband wasnt her type but his kindness was what made her fall for him. Over time he became her new type. But not everyone can handle a relationship like that. I would feel exactly the way you do in this situation. I'd first take a look at myself and try to remind myself of my best qualities. Then, I'd take a look at her from an objective perspective, and try to figure out if theres any indicators in the marriage that she is happy, or that she is not. Then, I'd sit her down, show her the video, but be kind about it and let her take some time to respond to you about it, rather than expecting an immediate answer... I mean that's what I would do. You could also just keep this to yourself but I dont do well thinking about stuff. Also, why would this person send you that video? Is there a malicious intention, jealousy, or perhaps someone who was just concerned for you all this time and finally betrayed their friend on your behalf? I know this doesnt answer all the questions but rather poses more, but try to be logical, analytical and objective before making an emotion-fueled decision. I'm so sorry for you brother, and I wish I was there with you right now to share a pint and talk it out."

AskReddit,f4xakzv,t3_dm5h26,1571863905.0,"Yes once when I did mushrooms I had a moment of total clarity and all my stress and depression literally melted away. Then the stitching on the seats in the bar started moving, and the sports on TV were like hand-drawn coloured pencil images but moving, and the urinal became exponentially deeper as I pissed into it, and my buddy decided to wear my hat, and everything turned purple. By the end I was in bed and it was rocking like I was on a ship and my window turned into a porthole and everything was still purple. Only time in my life I never felt any depression was that night."
AskReddit,f4uqke1,t1_f4ullb0,1571824371.0,Oh ok makes sense I imagined an adult doing this
AskReddit,f4tnlda,t1_f4rz44a,1571791333.0,Yeah the political side of FB is killing me right now. Gave up IG because people act like they're famous and all my friends who are on there usually share their experiences with me so I dont need to look at it online
AskReddit,f4tndl1,t1_f4s0pz6,1571791220.0,That's good! It's all full of bs and people with inflated egos
sex,f4tn1t1,t1_f4thqzc,1571791040.0,"Not my thing, nor is it hers. We have our entire lives intertwined and are really in love, monogamy is the only thing I want. So being open to others is off the table. But I dont judge anyone who chooses that, it's all personal preference and as long as everyone involved is happy, good for them. Just not for me"
sex,f4tmu8o,t1_f4td2ou,1571790925.0,Yeah having spent most of my life without climaxing during intercourse (no previous partner got me to finish until I met my current gf) sex was more about the emotional connection and act of being together with someone special. Made for a weird one night stand though haha and I wouldn't ever do that again since it's not an emotional thing at all
sex,f4tcqho,t1_f4tc712,1571786774.0,"That's okay, have you considered introducing oral post-intercourse? I mean if your partner doesnt mind the taste of lube/condom/themselves or whatever you do? Or even if you focus more on foreplay at the start and let the intercourse just be the dessert?
Also perhaps sex without climaxing sometimes is also okay, but dont give up on your own pleasure for someone else"
sex,f4tbyo6,t1_f4tbe3g,1571786479.0,"It does improve but takes practice and comfort. Took well over a year for me to climax for my gf. Now I'm about 70% ""success rate"" lol it took her understanding and loving me to help me find my comfort zone and retune my brain and body after all the (for lack of a better word) trauma"
sex,f4tbloc,t1_f4t9t15,1571786378.0,"I dont think I'm broken. In 3.5 years and counting, been living together a long time now. It's just a matter of her work being exhausting, a long commute, less free time and some issues like migraines and so on. But my sex drive is so out-of-whack high that I need more constant sexual interaction than she does. It's not either of our faults, and we are compatible with our fantasies etc, I'm just bored of trying to wank on my own time or use the various toys I own. Wondering if theres any unconventional ways to reduce that sexual urge or satisfy it solo is all"
