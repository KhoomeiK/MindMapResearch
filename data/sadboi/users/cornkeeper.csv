depression,f0xb14z,t1_f0x99iw,1569027107.0,"I like to think she was being impulsive and not methodical about her reaction, but this is by far the most extreme she has gotten. It was kinda scary and surreal. If this was a regular thing, I would consider it. But at the moment, I just want to fix it. On top of everything, I’ve been dealing with depression for about 2 years now. Suicide is a tough subject but something I think about constantly."

I just want us to be happy like we were 6 months ago..we have good days all the time, but occasionally we will get these days and it sucks so much. I want to marry her one day and I’ll do anything for her, but yelling at me is something I don’t even know how to react to..."

Edit: note reads as, “behold twenty-six for that which you seek.”

I am 25 years old. Here’s hoping I don’t die when I turn 26 lol"

When I don’t have an active campaign, I always make characters that I can play as in the future. Are there anyone cool ones you’ve created that you haven’t played out yet??"
depression,f04q98m,t3_d3mqe2,1568393185.0,"I noticed that you like D&D in your comments. As a fellow Dungeon or Dragon-er, I would love to talk about your fav characters. I use D&D as an escape and I would love to hear about your adventures sometime. 

You do matter and this community is the best to reaffirm that. Hitting lows are really exhausting, but I totally understand with everything you’ve been saying. If you need to talk, hit me up."

depression,eya5uiq,t1_ey9mcxs,1566958609.0,Thank you so much for all the help. You and the other people in this chat gave me just what I needed to get back to feeling at 40% (the safe number). I really appreciate it.
depression,eya5pkj,t1_ey9t4qr,1566958552.0,"Going further, the only thing I have been able to do is just grit my teeth in the moment and the slowly release the tension. It’s helped me, but people often look at that as aggression, which is something I totally am far from...definitely not good for my teeth either. But I’ve awake for far too long today, it’s time for me to official retire for the evening. Thank you so much for your kind words. You and the other kind people in this chat were able to pull me up and I really appreciate it."
depression,ey9tgo0,t1_ey9t4qr,1566952132.0,"Thank you for your words. Honestly, your validation brings me a lot of comfort right now. Sometimes I do but get interrupted by “priorities”and I have to push myself to get the next hurdle. There’s a lot of things I wish I could change about society, but ultimately, I think it’s just either my mindset or the people around me I should alter. I like to think logically about things and give them a deep look over, but emotions have always been difficult for me. 


I have to get back to class, but I’m coming back to respond more later!"

depression,ey9lx61,t1_ey9lofn,1566946536.0,"I think a big part of it  is that in 2006 my older sister’s boyfriend, at the time (husband now), was such an influencing character in my life and that’s the music he like. I always felt cool listening to and playing to that music when I was around him because he would nod in approval lol it made me feel on the same level as him. 

Ps: he was in a band too, an original metal band. Same instrument as me lol"
