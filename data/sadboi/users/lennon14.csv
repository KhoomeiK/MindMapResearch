BPD4BPD,fhp0nb4,t3_f2qxbx,1581779553.0,"I have been in treatment for BPD and doing DBT group and individual therapy and overall it has been life changing. I have been able to live my life in a way I don’t think I could before. However recently I fell on the ice outside of work and suffered a concussion. Because of the stress at work and personal life and financial stress, etc I am having a hard time recovering from it. It has almost been a month but I’m struggling with overstimulation and concentration issues and especially ANXIETY like I wasn’t before. Anyway I’m struggling to accept that this is just a set back. I am constantly worrying that people at work are judging me and I am worried that they are thinking I am dragging out the injury for whatever reason so I can be off from work and I am worried that I’m not doing enough in my life. I’m constantly comparing myself to my peers. I’m 27 and I currently work part time which is an accomplishment for me and I’ve worked hard to get here. But the people around me work full time in their careers , minimal health issues, physically active and have calendars full of activities to schedule around. It makes me feel inadequate and I’m struggling with comparisons right now. I have skills from DBT but sometimes it’s hard to remember how far I’ve come as a whole when a setback happens."

Anxiety,fhixck0,t1_fhird0h,1581633726.0,Thank you! It’s reassuring just to know that other people experience it too. It’s terrifying to get an idea in my head that I’m going to slip out of reality or something and then I can’t get back in control for a while.

This is a big accomplishment! 💜I struggle with binge eating too and pizza is definitely something that has been a trigger for me in the past as well. It can be hard to realize sometimes how far you’ve come from where you started so keep reminding yourself of that!

Anxiety,fhfdvi6,t3_f2qedd,1581541417.0,Sometimes I hear what sounds like a radio station cutting in and out. I always get nervous and google my symptoms hoping it’s normal but I’m glad other people seem to experience this with anxiety too.
Anxiety,fhf9voh,t3_f2rho2,1581539149.0,Put some very cold water on your face perhaps on a paper towel and bend over and hold your breath for as long as you can up to 30 seconds.
