I don’t want to drop the bombshell on him, but I’ve tried to tell him what was happening before me and P split ways, but he wouldn’t listen. Now it’s too late and I don’t remember most of it, only snippets. But ALL of the emotions are still there. I doubt he would listen now even if I did manage to remember. I’ve been trying to remember though so I at least have SOME evidence to go by, because I realize it sounds shady as shit that someone hurt me badly and I suddenly don’t remember what it is.

One thing I can say though is I believe therapy would be a good option, preferably having a therapist that specializes in this. Do keep in mind the first therapist you try isn’t always going to be the perfect match, and it’s good to try different ones until you find the best one to help. If she is uncomfortable with therapy you could always go with her, but alternatively if she wants to go alone don’t take it personally. You sound very patient and very caring, so I don’t have much worry in that. It can be extremely hard to talk about trauma, sometimes especially around people we love."

It’s okay if a comment here or there gets to you, you’re human. But don’t dwindle on stuff unnecessarily, it’s only going to drag you down. Literally EVERYONE in high school has an insecurity, and if someone tells you they don’t, they’re lying lmao. Popular kids I knew in high school? Insecure as fuck at the time too. So just be you, just vibe man, and other people will follow.

And! As a college student who never went into sports, I highly recommend trying a sport at least once. I’ve always been super self conscious because of my small weak state so I never did anything that would make me “look like a fool”. (Which would be everything and anything active.) Now I’m dealing with the consequences of not being active at all and trying to catch up with it to be even a little bit healthier lmao. To hell with looking like a fool, you do you man. Literally no one cares, and if you do get picked on then fuck them.
Also wear whatever you want. If people pick on you for that as well, to hell with them. They aren’t going to remember it after high school so who even cares.

Our family was really admired in my neighborhood (it was a really tight-knit neighborhood, and very very Mormon.) My Nfather is really successful (I don’t want to go into his profession) so I think that has something to do with it. We were the perfect family! We had everything together! A loving husband and wife with three beautiful daughters. So since we were praised so much for it, I believed all of it. I thought it was normal to have a dad who yelled at their kids and/or had episodes of rage directed at them when no one was looking. Yes it sucked to be the target of most of this and never get an apology, at times I’d be the one ending up apologizing and/or comforting him. I believed my Nfather loved me unconditionally.
Things only started to look suspicious when I went over to a friends house for the first time (I was a pretty lonely kid so I didn’t do that often, which probably didn’t help either). My friends mom came in and asked her to do her chores, really calm and natural. My friend wasn’t scared or even timid, she just said okay and that was that. I was really shocked at this considering I’m used to my parent kicking in and yelling about how I’m being selfish and not doing anything, and if I did do chores then I did them wrong and I couldn’t ever do anything right. (I still have a complex about that and a lot of other things to this day.)

Rightfully so, because when P and I were having the fall out I tried to get L to do a lot of message errands for me, considering P refused to answer me for anything. It was really tiring on L and that was a mistake on my part.
The thing is, I know L loves me. He would do ANYTHING for me...except this. If none of this stuff was happening, I’d honestly consider this the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in."

Still wasn’t, and to this day nearly all my friends are younger than me because I am too scared to talk to people my age. I’m too scared I’ll accidentally out myself on how stupid I am compared to everyone else."
