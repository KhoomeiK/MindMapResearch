harrypotterwu,fqu2dus,t3_gkv3yz,1589650692.0,"Started at midnight. Didn't finish until 2:30am because I decided to get my daily out of the way too. Honestly, I was really scared  due to this subreddit making it sound like everyone was incompetent.  I had a great time as a level 14 Auror. Always passed my focus, confusion on who I needed to confuse (4 and 5\* WW and Erklings). Fight my dudes when they showed up. If my guys weren't around then I jumped in to first strike everything but spiders then jump out.  Pretty simple even for someone like me who's first time team fighting above ruins was just 12 hours ago.

Looking at all the complaint posts, it really seems like everyone has super duper high expectations of everyone. That isn't too fair. There are lag issues.  There are connection issues galore. Sometimes someone does something silly, like me being tired and passing focus to the auror next to the professor, who thank goodness passed that over to the right person. Sure sometimes people weren't doing the exact right thing . My example would be the last Pixie in Dark 5. I jumped in, hit it, jumped out and waited for the Mazo to jump in. They didn't, so the other auror jumped in, hit it jumped out. Still the Mazo didn't jump on it. The prof, me, and the other auror just threw our spells at it from afar until it died. I'm not mad at the Mazo, it was a one off, and not that big of a deal.   It likely wasn't malice in that case, it was likely a connection issue.  If anything, it was kind of funny. We finished with plenty of time to spare.

Remember - this is just a game after all. Casuals still want to finish CD, so let's all keep an open mind."
harrypotterwu,fqtzkcm,t1_fqtyllp,1589649129.0,"Assuming there was lag, and it's likely - Almost everything else on the screen is a curiosity which Mazos take extra damage from.  If  bravery wasn't up  no one should be tackling the elite. That means they didn't have anything to attack. I would have hopped on non elite pixies to first strike and back out until a dark arts foe showed up\*

\*I think. I'm an Auror who didn't start high chambers until 12 hours ago, but I did do a ton of research here."

We got him to a store to check his gait and such then had them recommend a shoe. The soles are great, but he still goes through 2 or 3 pair a year due to the tops getting caught on something. We're looking at getting him custom inserts on some more durable shoes this time around.

Also - good socks help immensely as well. We like the copper fit because of the extra stitching and padding in top of the toes and in the soles. In the 3 years we've been together I haven't seen him tear through any like he used to with regular socks."

What crushed me was the trauma that dentist put a ton of other kids through. My sister  would get hysterical when we went due to the pain. One time she needed a tooth pulled, and my mom asked them to use the gas. We could hear her screaming from the waiting room. She said it hurt, and he said there was no way due to gas. The next year we found out she had nose problems where she couldn't breathe through it. The gas mask they used went over the nose. My mom never forgave herself.

Funny story to bring the mood up. I needed a filling but I worked somewhere where I needed to be on the phone. I didn't want to take a full day off because I liked saving my vacation time. I knew I wouldn't be able to talk if I got  novocaine. So I asked my dentist if I could go without.

AskReddit,fq67x0h,t1_fq1ld1h,1589126293.0,"You're getting downvoted but no on is explaining why. Let me see if I can shine a light on why  some male doctors dismiss women.

Women's pain is not taken seriously by doctors.  [Here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=women%27s+pain+ignored+by+doctors&btnG=) are a bunch of research papers written on the subject. [This](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562) article sums it up using less science jargon. I've personally went through it myself. I gained 100 pounds in less than a year, I was in pain, I had horrible periods (one lasted 3 months where  during parts of it I was bleeding through a super tampon and a super pad in less than an hour), I was tried all the time and I was losing hair on my head, but growing hair in weird places all of a sudden. The weight gain really messed me up because I've been 115-130 pounds my whole life and then I was pushing about 215-230. I went through 5 years of male doctors not doing any tests, not even an ultrasound. They were telling me I was being irrational about my period and I all my other problems were because I was fat. All I needed to do was change my birth control and go on a diet.

I moved up north, got a female doctor, broke down in her office because I was at the end of my rope. She took me seriously. In less than a week I got my answer. I have [PCOS](https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome).  Polycystic ovary syndrome has a plethora of things that come with it. Hormone imbalance (I have too many male hormones, not enough female), [cysts that form in my ovaries,](https://i.imgur.com/dQeWy9K.png) type 2 diabetes and infertility just to name some.   A simple ultrasound  was all it took for this diagnosis. I also found out I have a [severely heart shaped uterus](https://i.imgur.com/Td92sxR.png). There is basically zero chance of me carrying to term. That explained the two miscarriages I had. Miscarrying, even if I don't want children, was it's own personal hell on it's own.

What really blew my mind is that PCOS is actually common. 5-10% of women get it. While describing my symptoms my gyno told me that's likely what I had and she just wanted to confirm with the ultrasound. Why didn't the male doctors care enough to do a simple test for a syndrome that affects 5-10% of the female population?

A birth control change, weight watchers ,and metformin was all it took. I lost the 100 pounds. I wasn't in pain anymore because the new BC stopped my periods. I felt like a new person. Why did I have to live in hell for half a decade?

A point of contention that I still have for male doctors is this. My cysts burst sometimes. It hurts as bad as you think it does. I don't even bother going to the hospital anymore because male doctors just don't care and never do anything about it. Which is scary, because if one is big enough and bursts, I could lose an ovary or my life. There are times I am bleeding profusely and in so much pain I can't walk or even bend over. When this happens I tell myself ""It's better to hurt at home instead of waiting 6 hours in an ER to be told it's normal to feel faint from blood loss."" It's sad that I put my life on the line because I know I won't be taken seriously. If a man had a cyst in his balls that burst you can bet he'll be on morphine and have an ultrasound within the hour of being brought back to the exam room.

Don't even get me started on hysterectomies. 10 years of pain. About 10% chance of actually having a child due to the two problems. Time bomb cysts in my ovaries. Yet, I STILL can't find a doctor that will do it ""because I might want kids someday."" 8 more  years until I'm 40. I'm hoping by then they won't use that excuse, but I'm not holding my breath."

kratom,fq56mbh,t3_ggnerj,1589094217.0,"The only time I add baking soda is if I use Apple Cider Vinegar for my extraction so it doesn't taste as nasty. I don't think adding just baking soda will do anything, but I may be wrong. The best bubbles I get are from using food grade citric acid. You can get 5 pound bags from Amazon pretty cheap.   


Here is what I generally do - 1/4th teaspoon citric acid, 1/4 cup of boiling water. 3 grams of kratom. Mix in a freezer safe glass. (I use a ceramic coffee cup) Let it cool to room temperature. Then freeze for at least 8 hours. Make sure whatever you are freezing it in is small enough that the crystals crush the kratom. If you do it in something like... a large square Tupperware container, it's not going to work. This is just me, and it gets me consistent bubbles.  [Here](https://www.doublemherbals.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1115) is a thread on double M where people talk about what they do."
kratom,fq563zh,t3_gglweh,1589093730.0, Kratom really varies so using a teaspoon isn't the best method. You could accidentally under or overdose yourself if you aren't using a scale. You can nab a scale pretty cheap. Got mine from wally world online for 10 bucks.
kratom,fq54fou,t1_fq52g87,1589092192.0,"Maybe I can chime in here. First, this isn't blaming the addict. I'm a former addict. I know how easy it is to go 'Huh, that helped me a lot. I wonder if taking MORE will be even better!""   


My SO started using Kratom to help with addiction and pain. He started taking more.. and more... and more... until basically an hour after he dosed he was in active kratom withdrawal. I proposed he taper and quit because the cure was just as bad as the problem.  He ended up claiming he quit and hid his usage from me for 8 months.   


What upset me the most wasn't the lies. It wasn't he blew 1000 bucks on bunk head shop kratom that likely wasn't tested. It wasn't even that he was still taking kratom. What made me sad, and a little pissed is he knew he was an addict, and here is was being one again, just with legal stuff.   


We both take it now but I keep an eye on how much we buy, how long it should last, and how long it lasts. Max dose is 3.5 grams 4 times a day.  We switch strains. We take a lot of precautions now to ensure he doesn't slip back into his old ways. I personally take a T break at least once a week even if it means I know I will be in pain that day. It's a lot of work because we are both predispositioned to want more more more. Thing is, I don't ever want him to  go back to the way he was being in withdrawal within an hour.   


Knowing what we know, and what we went through.... if he took extract now and messed up all this hard work.... yeah I would be BEYOND PISSED. I might even call off our engagement. There's using something to help you, and then there's using something just to feel high. Example - taking two benadryl for allergies is fine. Taking 10 to trip isn't. I don't want to be an addict anymore, and I don't want him to be one either. To me the distinction is what we take and how much. Extract would be entirely too far."

You're absolutely right about some cops making decisions that might not be theirs to make. Also right when you speak about how  some cops may profile people.

WinStupidPrizes,fq4mzjj,t1_fq4k5dj,1589079803.0,"You're *very* sure *most* places would arrest someone for not wearing pants, then mention a city that won't. Not trying to be mean, but you kind of proved yourself wrong didn't you? Before making the blanket statement did you take a peek at a bunch of  state and county laws before stating that, or is it just personal opinion?

I could very well be biased and wrong. My opinion is that maybe 1/ 4th of states/counties have a law in the books requiring pants and shirt at all times. The US is huge so I don't want to say there are none. I'm thinking somewhere like... I dunno.. a Morman ran Utah town. lol

I live in a state that has a ton of water. Beaches, lakes, springs you name it. Bikinis are a thing, women aren't getting arrested for wearing a bikini in a public place. However, there are rules for private property. That's where the no shirt no shoes thing comes in. If someone refuses, and  they are trespassed,  then they come back later... maybe they will be arrested. Those are rules though, not laws. In that situation the person isn't breaking a law about clothing, they are breaking a law like trespassing. That's why I laugh about the ""masks are tyranny thing"" because it's not law where I live, but it is a rule for some stores. Just like the pants and shoe requirement is just a rule. Tyranny is like..... North Korea. Or going to jail for life because of a speeding ticket. Not some stores having some rules. 

It would be interesting to try to dig into the law and see if there really is places where there are laws. I might have to go down a rabbit hole later to try to see if I can find out what the true number is."
mturk,fq0vg7j,t1_fq0sfa0,1589038143.0,"Hi Werkz! I totally understand! Juggling a queue, the hit you are on, and then coaching requesters is actually kind of hard. Especially when it's something we know is blatantly wrong.(no code, TOS stuff, or even problems in the survey) I wish I still had my old canned messages saved on my computer, but when I installed a new SSD, it I lost all of them. I am working on building them back up, but it's a slow process. If I may, I would suggest writing your own messages to shoot off to requesters for minor things that come up a lot. What I did back in the day is as soon as I saw something they should know about, I would go into the hit, and open the message requester screen in another tab. Then I would finish the hit, after that I would copy and paste one of the canned messages over and send it.   That's why I provided screen-prints here just in-case someone wanted to save them to send to requesters.

I urge all users to create their own canned messages because it does help everyone in the long run.  For example - Any hit under an hour I always send a message about timers and how we queue work. I explain if they don't need the data \*right now\*,  making their timers longer would greatly improve their chances of getting thoughtful, good data.  (I posted the template below) I have gotten multiple messages back [I actually had a requester say they didn't know we queue work yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/gg9d2d/requester_question_about_setting_long_duration/fpyjec5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) where requesters didn't know we queued work. Now those requesters know about it and will adjust their hits accordingly. Hopefully they will tell their colleagues or ethics boards as well. Win-Win for workers and requesters alike.

In this case I bet it was just a requester who didn't know. I don't think they really had any malicious intent. The link I posted is the acceptable use policy, not something a ton of people dig into. If you check out the Amazon documentation about setting up hits and things like that, they don't mention these things. I can say after 7 years on Mturk, when I was asked for my name, providing those links or saying ""tos violation to ask"" has never lead to a rejection.

Timer template - Top is what I send anyone under an hour. Bottom is what I have sent if I know I can't complete something on time. Haven't been rejected yet, but it might happen, so please be careful if you take that route.

*I’m writing you in hopes of helping you out for future Mturk hits. The timer is not a timer for how  long the hit would take, but it is there to give workers  time to complete the hit to the best of their ability.  When a timer runs out, we lose the ability to submit the hit.  Workers will rush if the timer is short, this could affect your data. Please consider setting your timer to 3 hours or more if you are not needing the data immediately. This allows workers to queue your work up, complete the rest of the tasks they have, then complete your hit without feeling rushed.*

*I noticed the timer was too short to allow me to complete your hit in time without rushing. What I will do is go ahead and submit the hit with my worker Id \[insert worker ID\] I will follow up with an email with the code, and a link to a screenprint of the last page of the survey to prove that I took it. I ask that you do not reject because I wanted to give you good data, and this was the only way that could happen.*"

AskReddit,fpyk24z,t1_fpxglk4,1589005251.0,"Oh man, I used to be a bouncer and it's the same concept. I am ALWAYS checking the floor wherever I go.  The worst/best place is the bathroom. The place I was at hired women so we could go in the women's room without being creepy.  Worst - many phones in back pockets end up in toilets. Drunks girls don't care, they will still use an obviously messed up toilet.  My fiance thinks it's funny  that I'm great at plunging toilets, but it's because after I removed the phones, they always needed plunging. Best - so much money around the toilet from people putting money in their back pockets and losing it when they go potty. Way more money in the girls room than the mens room.

Checking under the bar if there are chairs, and empty cig packs sometimes lead to money too. Granted - we always tried to find someone one that looked upset so we could return the property. However, 9 times out of 10 if they were  drunk enough to lose it, they didn't notice it was gone.

mturk,fpyfwlg,t3_gg9d2d,1589003236.0,"Just to make sure I have this right... you are setting the timer itself to 60 minutes correct? You are worried if someone sees a 60 minute timer that they may be scared away? If so, please don't worry about that. I prefer a longer timer. I thank the stars when I see a requester has ensured I have time to finish my queue and then work on their hit.

I would put a note right after the consent form and in the instructions. Some people don't click the instruction bar at the top of the hit. Something like ""The screener is X.XX. If you pass the screener, you will be directed to complete the rest of the survey for a bonus of X.XX. It should take X amount of time to complete the rest of the survey after the screener.""

Two things.

1. If the hit really does take 20 minutes after the screener, maybe set the timer to 2 hours. We are constantly fielding and trying to catch hits. We have to prioritize our queues, we don't just do one hit, look for another, ect. We catch as many as we can at a time and work through them. Sometimes the catcher scripts cut off the hit title. If someone caught the hit only seeing ""4 minutes"" they may think they can do it quickly between other longer, higher paying hits. I've accidentally done this myself. I will start the hit, realize it will take too long, and return it because I have higher paying hits that I wouldn't be able to finish if I completed the one I was currently working.
2. Just a heads up that some people might return the hit anyway. We regularly get boned when it comes to bonuses. I don't know if I would invest 20 additional minutes if I am only getting base pay for 4 minutes.  I didn't read your prior message but lets use 20 cents a minute as a base. Lets say you pay .80 for the screener. You promise a bonus of $4.00 for them to stick around and do 20 more minutes of work. If I spend the 20 minutes on your hit, and you don't bonus, I'm out 4 dollars. This isn't counting whatever else I could have made in that time as well. My motto is ""I don't work for promises.""  If you are willing to have some people who pass the screener not actually do the follow up survey, I would suggest making the follow up survey it's own hit. You can award the people who pass the screener some kind of qualification. ([here is a good place to start.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMechanicalTurkRequester/Concepts_QualificationsArticle.html) ). Then you can publish the follow up survey as it's own hit where only the people who got the ""passed screener"" qualification (or whatever you want to call it) can take it.

Edit - I read you may be worried about people not knowing about the follow up.  You can send an email to workers letting them know the hit is live. I am personally taking a break from Mturk until unemployment goes below a certain percent, but I still take time out of my day to do any follow ups that come across in my email. Also, if workers are using a hit finder script, then only those who are qualified will see it. If the pay is enough they will definitely grab it as soon as they see it. 

My other motto other than ""I don't work for promises"" is ""I'll work for a proven bonus""  If you don't want to go the qualification route, then you will have to rely on people who review your hits. Whenever I get a bonus, i always update my reviews so workers know it's ""safe"" to work for a bonus.   This make take some time, but if you are quick about sending the bonus, and people review, then hopefully you won't see a lot of returns on your hits.

Hope this helps!

Edit - BTW, thank you for coming here to ask us. I'm just a worker who has been around for  a while so this is just my humble opinion. If you get word from someone like turkerhub about how to best set up the hit, please by all means take their advice. :)"

mturk,fpwl31u,t1_fpwkxpx,1588965348.0,"Cool, the how about reversing those rejections instead of [blasting](https://i.imgur.com/DHszxtg.png) the person on Reddit?  You shouldn't put workers approval rates on the line just because you didn't know what a qualification was. Note- I mentioned you likely have other costs. My main beef is that you are here saying you have learned from your mistake, while also claiming that this was poor work. If you had set up a qualification test, you wouldn't have gotten (what you consider) poor work. This isn't all that poor, it's iffy grammar and one spelling mistake. It's better to reverse the rejections to save your approval rate than it is to come here trying to justify a rejection.

A more professional approach would have been to state ""T*his submission  wasn't up to our standards. However we now know that we can set up tests to find the best workers for our hits. From here on out we will only allow workers who pass those tests to work on our hits. This is to ensure the highest quality submissions will be provided to our customers. Due to the confusion, we will reverse the rejections we have submitted. If you would like to take our qualification test, the link is \[link\]. We look forward to working with the Mturk community to help us in this venture.""*

See? No bashing a worker publicly on the same profile you are using to promote your work. Additionally, it might be a good idea to separate the two accounts. Now you have people knowing they can use Mturk to source their own descriptions and/or you are showing people how to compete with you. Not a really smart move either way.

Side note - My grammar is horrible, so yeah. lol"
mturk,fpwdtrk,t3_gfodj4,1588961698.0,Hello sunshines! Providing some middle of the day support! Happy Friday ya'll!
mturk,fpwax63,t1_fpw508p,1588960254.0,"Post history seems a little suspicious.  Within the year they were asking how to pay a second person  (a translator) if they were the sole proprietor in the company. 3 months ago they again mention they are the sole proprietor. What this means is they are the only one on payroll. What some workers don't like is that requesters use us to create things they then sell our data using buzzwords. Professional. Expert. Heck, some even claim it's AI when it's just us.

I kind of stopped caring about that a long time ago. If someone wants to use the data I sell to them, as long as it's ethical and a good price, I don't care. Who's to say some Mturk workers aren't professionals? I remember a copywriter here helping me with a template I give to users to send to requesters. If you asked me to review a foreclosure file based on the law 8 years ago I could likely also give you professional information about it. So while it's not an out and out lie, it is a little shady.

The only problem I have is when they don't pay enough and/or they are way too strict. In this case, it would have been super  easy to A. Make a qualification test. Or B. See that was a easily made typo that wouldn't have been picked up on most built in spellcheckers.[Worse,  by going through the  post history of the requester,  you can see they sell the data we provide for 3-14 bucks a pop](https://i.imgur.com/GAaamrK.png) . If I was rejected, and knew all they had to change was simple mistake to make 3 dollars... I'd be a little heated about it.

Throwing this edit in here -TV shows the following [payments](https://i.imgur.com/9Ei8CGp.png) for the hits VS what they sell the data for. Math might be off I just woke up.

35 words - pay is 25 cents - sells for $3.00. Take home for requester is  $2.75 or 91.66%

60 words - pay 40 cents - sells for $6.00. Take home for requester is $5.60 or 93.33%

16 words - pay $1.00 - sell for $14.00 Take home for requester  is $13.00 or 92.85%

[TV is showing a pay rate that is less than minimum wage in a lot of states  - $9.36](https://i.imgur.com/QccbbXi.png). Additionally, while I know it's not on the requester, it does seem they are taking advantage of the situation where a lot of people are turning to things like Mturk due to a, ya know, pandemic and losing their job. [Their post history shows they have made 70k off what we do for them. Oh, and it's considered only a ""side hussle"" to them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/eowvbc/solopreneurs_how_do_you_structure_your_side/)  Granted, I know taxes are a thing. I also know they have to pay for the hits, and likely has to have some sort of server or hosting space for the information to be saved on. I also understand it takes time to write code for a product and it also takes time to get it off the ground. However, in this case when our data is being sold for over a 90% increase on the other end, it does seem a bit unfair to reject for something as simple as what they rejected for."
AdultsAreFuckinStupid,fptohct,t1_fptdrij,1588895118.0,"To be quite honest, I'm glad it was me. I lived in a really rough area.  My complex was state funded, so mostly old people and families that needed housing help. The apartment complex across the street was a lot worse, and people had taken notice that some bad people from there were prowling our complex. When I was in the hospital, word  was that it was some sort of initiation from a gang from the other complex. I'm happy that it was me and not a kid or an older person. I had to learn a lot, but in a way my life is a lot better  than it was. Thank you for your words though. <3"
AdultsAreFuckinStupid,fpsq6eg,t1_fpsndnl,1588877736.0,"Come July it will be 4 years since the injury. There were I think three or four more MRI or CAT scans taken after that one. I recently found out I could access them, so I've been really curious about \*what\* happened to my brain.   


 Apparently I woke up by my apartment, crawled in my house and for two or three days told my mom I was okay. When I started calling things the wrong thing she got my ex boyfriend to take me to the hospital, (she was bed bound) that's the last thing I remembered until I ""woke up"" in rehab. I thank the wonderful care team that I had in the ICU for 2 weeks, step down room in the hospital for 2 weeks and the month I spent in outpatient rehab. They got me walking as good as they could. It still took about 2 more years to learn how to walk ""right"" again.  They taught me math, and how to set alarms to remind me to do things that I would forget. Like eat or use the restroom. I still have issues with remembering those things to this day. The crazy thing is not being able to remember a lot of my past, but also realizing I am a totally different person than I was before the attack.  My past is slowly coming back, but my short term memory is totally shot. The pain is still there, and I get really tired and overwhelmed easily. It makes holding down a real job extremely hard.   


I wish I could have gotten follow up care after rehab, I remember them wanting to do follow up MRIs, but Florida's disability is really.... really crappy. There is some lingering PTSD, and anxiety that I didn't use to have, but I still consider myself lucky all things considered."
AdultsAreFuckinStupid,fpsiv1o,t1_fpsbxz3,1588874211.0,"do you think ask docs would read my MRIs then put it in layman terms? I wasn't in any position to understand my results when I woke up.

 Large acute left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema, small acute  left subdural hematoma, and likely right inferior frontal hemorrhagic contusion with edema.

Mild asymmetric dilatation of the temporal horn of the right  lateral ventricle could be seen with early ventricular entrapment. Correlation for cerebral  herniation syndromes is recommended and short-term imaging follow-up and/or additional further  imaging to exclude underlying process could be pursued as indicated and as clinical status  permits.   Left hemispheric subdural hematoma measuring up to 6 mm.  3 mm right frontal convexity subdural hematoma near the vertex is also noted."

2. You're right, Repo was the wrong thing. I'll keep it up there though. However, there are things being done right now that do hurt us.  See the most recent headline where trump has said won't pass another CARES act bill unless there is payroll cuts included. https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2020/05/04/the-winners-and-losers-of-trumps-payroll-tax-cut-proposal/#5b009eb63a16"

Trump thinks the market is the end all be all marker of how hes doing. So screw people that actually need help.~~  I was incorrect here.  While this was wrong, there is plenty being done to block help for the little people. Like trump not signing anymore covid bills unless there is a payroll tax cut included in it. 

Just like my fiance's job is deemed essential. He gets an extra 100 bucks a week when he works over 35 hours. His home improvement store's profits are through the roof right now. Covid isn't going away, but the hazard pay will.  This epidemic has really shown that corporations and politicians don't care. His job could easily give everyone a $2.50 an hour raise.

I have to charge and connect my bluetooth headphones because I forget how to work them on acid. I even pre cut up fruit so I dont accidentally hurt myself.

kratom,fpiojh1,t3_gdfgqh,1588645253.0,"I sometimes do, but then I remember that without Kratom I would be \*a lot\* worse.  I used to drink a ton. I've done so much cocaine that I've messed up my heart. I took 5-7 25mg adderall when I used to go out. MDMA was something I did at least 2 times a month. I think the worst is that I absolutely LOVED benadryl. I would take those 10 at a time just to dissociate. My fiance liked opiates. When I met him he was on suboxone. He also indulged in everything but the benadryl with me.  We sold all our bitcoin, we used apps like Dave and paycheck loans to keep that lifestyle up. We were depressed, suicidal, horrible people when we were doing drugs.  


 2 years into using Kratom.  He's off subs. I am also off everything except the occasional (2-3 times a year) acid trip and some drinking. Our bank account is... wow. We went from payday loans to having nearly 5k in savings while still being able to buy whatever we want!   


Are we trading something for another? I don't think so.  I like to think about our Kratom usage as something akin to anti-depressants. We both have a predisposition to addiction. Would you get mad at someone for taking an anti-depressant since it's ""pills"", or would you be glad they found something to help their mental health? Same applies to kratom."
relationship_advice,fpik15b,t1_fphpbmw,1588642514.0,"Your husband reminds me of my fiance. My  third night at his house my period started unexpectedly. I was trying to be super quiet and clean the bed while he slept (heavy sleeper) while internally freaking out. He woke up, saw the mess, and told me it was a normal human thing and to not be embarrassed. He's seen me throw up multiple times then tried to clean it himself (I wouldn't let him). Two years ago when my drinking was really bad I fell asleep in the bathroom and peed myself. I wouldn't have even known it happened except I saw a bunch of paper towels in our bathroom trashcan so I asked him what happened and he told me.   We laugh about that one now.

When he was withdrawing from trying to quit suboxone we spent plenty of nights together with me doing everything I could to ease the symptoms. I've held him in the tub with the shower running super hot to fight his shivering. I've made appointments and took him to the hospital when things get to be too much for him.    When he throws up I'm always there with water and a rag for his face. I've coached him through panic attacks like when our dog got diagnosed with cancer. Or when he couldn't stop throwing up due to a panic attack heading to work because he was scared of bringing COVID home to his family and me. I still handle most of his doctor appointments or make calls for him because his anxiety makes it hard to keep up with that kind of thing. I don't mind doing those things at all, because he's the breadwinner in our home and deserves to not be stressed out by things I can easily do.

Being with someone isn't always going to be rainbows and butterflies.  You need to know you can rely on someone when you need them. I have been in your shoes. Other than my prior marriage where he was cool about that stuff and my current relationship - I've tried to coach two men like that,  it doesn't work. Those were the worst years of my life.

There are three review sites. [TV](https://turkerview.com/)  \- TV has an all in one script that is  really amazing and is intergrated in other scripts as well. For newbies I would suggest pairing this with Mturk Suite so you can cut your teeth on seeing how scripts work together. Once you get the hang of MTS finder, then you can move on to a Panda crazy (accepting script) and forker (a finder script like MTS finder) Only issue with TV is if someone is rejected, TV doesn't update until the user updates. This wont work for brand new requester accounts, but if you see reviews that are older than 31 days without it saying approved, it's a good indication that it was rejected. The reason being that hits auto approve in 30 days, so if it's 31 days older without showing approved,  it might be rejected.

[TO1](https://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/) is the OG of review sites. The reviews here will skew worse than any of the listed sites. however, since it's been around so long it's a good thing to check when you are new since it has more historical data than the other three websites.

[TO2](https://turkopticon.info/) is the child to TO1 it still skews lower than Turkerview, but it's still good to have to catch reviews that people did not put on TV.

I personally prefer TV over TO, but checking even one of these is better than non at all. I would still say check at least two. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/et056q/cnrs_llf_geomphon_rejection/ffdbrau?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) is a good example of where one doesn't show updated for rejections yet, but the other site does.  If there isn't much as far as reviews go, you should err on  the side of caution until you get a nice safety net. Additionally,  it's  good practice to use something like this [dashboard enhancer](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/18991-mturk-worker-dashboard-enhancer).   It will show you what your approval rating will be if all your pending   hits are rejected, and also gives you the number of rejections you can   take until your approval drops below 99%. I know you are past that point, but while you are trying to get your approval up, knowing what your rating will be if all are rejected is a good thing to see.  


Mturk itself isn't a review site, but if you click on the requester name it will show something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/UKu2EWQ.png). If it's limited, or if the requester approval is under 99% then I wouldn't work for that requester until you get a safty net built up of approved hits."
mturk,fouuto1,t1_fot4egc,1588090766.0,">I don't think that there are many people trying to hide work these days but dumbasses reviewing batches after doing a single hit so the hourly shows (those shouldn't be reviewed at all) and people being slowpokes in general are the reality of current turkerview.

What you are mentioning, one person doing one batch hit slowly then reviewing it could very well be someone trying to hide a decent batch. I used to make it a point to check out the ""red"" batch requesters because I noticed this trend.

Aside from that, I think people take the time spent as the end all be all on too many hits. When I look at reviews, I also look at the reading speed of the people that reviewed it. I think this is where TurkerView shines. I am a [relaxed paced](https://i.imgur.com/0y646kQ.png) speed because I screen print a lot of stuff. If I check a hit out and it's got a ton of  reviews from [proficient workers](https://i.imgur.com/EZ8W161.png) or [fast readers](https://i.imgur.com/o2Uz93U.png), then I know ahead of time my hourly isn't going to be as much. I also like that the system flags people who go [unreliably fast](https://i.imgur.com/Xm246IU.png) as well because it shows that that person likely just clicked through, and there's no way I will be able to match that hourly.

I'm not working Mturk right now, but with the  influx of new workers I could see where there is going to be a ton of silly reviews. I kinda take all that with a grain of salt. Unless it's something glaring like ""AC is broken"" then I don't pay too much attention to what people are saying."

One thing to keep in mind is that  workers are having to compete  against each other for the hits. If we held everyone's hand and taught them how to use the scripts, we are essentially taking away work from ourselves. Think of it like a commission only sales floor. A senior sales agent isn't going to hand the new guy the lead list the senior agent generated. The new guy needs to learn how to generate his own sales or he won't make any money. Mturk is the same way.

Google the script and see if there is a wiki (how to) for it. One hint, Panda Crazy and Mturk Suite both have wikis. I haven't used YouTube for Mturk help in a long time, but I would think there are some how to videos on there as well. Hope this helps!"

For instance, anyone with a timer less than an hour, gets that message from me. Since I have it saved in word, it only takes me 5 seconds to copy and paste over. The second I've sent if I notice in the middle I won't be able to complete the hit on time. I have only sent the second one once, maybe twice,  but I haven't been rejected. However your results may vary,

*I’m writing you in hopes of helping you out for future Mturk hits. The timer is not a timer for how  long the hit would take, but it is there to give workers  time to complete the hit to the best of their ability.  When a timer runs out, we lose the ability to submit the hit.  Workers will rush if the timer is short, & this could affect your data. Please consider setting your timer to 3 hours or more if you are not needing the data immediately. This allows workers to queue your work up, complete the rest of the tasks they have, then complete your hit without feeling rushed.*

&#x200B;

*I noticed the timer was too short to allow me to complete your hit in time without rushing. What I will do is go ahead and submit the hit with my worker Id \[insert worker ID\] I will follow up with an email with the code, and a link to a screenprint of the last page of the survey to prove that I took it. I ask that you do not reject because I wanted to give you good data, and this was the only way that could happen.*"

kratom,fo2ibl6,t1_fo1mfkg,1587463525.0,"This is pretty interesting. I noticed some side effects with my boyfriend that I thought were due to reduced testosterone starting a little more than a year and a half in after he started taking Kratom. He went and got bloodwork and the only issue was his prolactin was elevated, his T was fine. His doctor wanted him to get an MRI to check for a pituitary tumor in Oct 2019. Apparently they are common enough that even the supplemental insurances that cover lost wages for illnesses didn't cover them. We couldn't afford it. I adjusted his insurance so he could have 500 in a HSA account this year.   Dropped the ball, never got the MRI, then covid happened.

Granted, this is only one person.... but it makes me wonder. While I don't want him to have a brain tumor,  I also would hate for the side affects he's having be caused by Kratom. It's helped him so... so.... so much.  If what is happening to him is from kratom and not  tumor though,,,,,I know him and I would both endure those side effects other than the thought of him being in pain all the time or on opiates."

Requesters should not be rejecting based on time alone. If you did not miss any of the AC questions, and your data is consistent, then they should approve the hit. Below is a template I made for users who have been rejected for going too fast. All of it should come in under the 1000 character limit that we have on sending messages. I decided to add a blurb about review websites - feel free to take that out if you want.

""I would like to discuss overturning this rejection with you. Mturk workers will almost always complete hits in a faster time-frame than standard estimates because our job is to take surveys all day. I pride myself on providing the best data I can, as quickly as possible. If I did not miss any attention checks in the survey, and I did not provide inconsistent answers, please review this link [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/ReversingRejectedAssignment.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/ReversingRejectedAssignment.html) It has the step by step instructions on how to reverse the rejection.

Keep in mind that rejections hurt our ratings and our ability to complete work on Mturk. When workers are rejected, we post reviews to requester review sites. Since this is an unfair rejection, you may likely get a bad requester rating. If your rating goes down, workers who pride themselves on keeping a high rating may not do your hits. This means that your data could suffer.

Please advise me when this hit is reversed so I know when to expect to see it on my end.

Thank you
