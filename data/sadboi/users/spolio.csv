""The British said that the sun never set on the British Empire and the Romans called Rome “Caput Mundi,” the capital of the world, but Britain faded and Rome was sacked.

These two empires carved out swaths of the world as their own and had some of the longest periods of concentrated dominance that any empires have ever had. However, in the end, both fell victim to their greed for new territory and wealth, as they expanded beyond the capacity of their bureaucracy and military, and to the pride that their great civilization instilled in them.

Empires fall when their power and glory outweighs their capacity for government and self-reflection. They fall when their greed and hubris outweighs their common sense. All empires succumb to this — there has been no everlasting empire — and any modern or future empire would do well to heed the patterns that were displayed by empires of the past."""
