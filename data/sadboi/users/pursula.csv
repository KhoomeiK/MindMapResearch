I‚Äôm a teen who wears them because of an endless amount of reasons, all of which are comfort. Never had a negative mental impact from wearing a fucking bikini. It‚Äôs a piece of clothing, the only people who actually care are incels and modest Christian women (vague example). I don‚Äôt go swimming to fuck the dudes there, the reason I don‚Äôt wear something that ‚Äúcovers more of my body‚Äù is because it makes swimming much more comfortable and easier and I enjoy the feeling of sun on my skin. Trust me, if I could go topless, I totally fucking would but I won‚Äôt because of the many creepy older people at the beach who sexualize it and think it‚Äôs an open invitation to put their hands on me. I‚Äôm sure depending on the girl, they have different reasons tho. I get told that I should ‚ÄúrESPEct MYsElF‚Äù and it‚Äôs genuinely the stupidest fucking thing they could say to me.
