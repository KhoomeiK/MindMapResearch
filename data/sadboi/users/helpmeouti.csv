Those who would help me were of no use, and those that could have helped, made things worse with their half-assed attempts. 

Y'ever laugh so hard you thought you would pass out, only to find that you could laugh even harder? Yeah. I had a series of moments that I thought were rock bottom. Things only got worse after the suicide attempt, and then they got progressively worse time and again. I was either abandoned, or I rejected those whose ""help"" only made me feel worse. I was alone, and should have died that way,  but somehow, I didn't. 

The good news is that you can come through this even if you have no one. Bad news is, I have no clue how I did it, to explain it to you. I think that appealing to people who are unequipped to handle strong negative emotions is going to get you turned away by the people you rely on the most. One of the closest people to me was a professional in that very field, and they were arguably worse than an uneducated person. 

Get someone whose job is to deal with whatever you're going through, and try to remember that what makes depression and anxiety severe is the attempt to force it away. You have to just let yourself feel it, without attempting to feel how you think you should. These feelings can be transient, if you don't resist them, or they can become as prevalent as you fear, by simply trying to make them stop."

""Do not ascribe to malice that which can be better explained by stupidity""

Rather than saying that cbt has been misused here, it looks like its been poorly applied by a litany of under skilled practitioners. Believe me, I can't even get as far as that, because my professionals don't even have the skills or intuition to ask the right questions without getting frustrated with me.  

And that's another thing. You're probably a lot smarter than your therapists, which is why you think the issue isn't as simple as they want to boil it down to. I can't understand why the reams of data I give aren't enough for a months worth of insightful questions before we even get down to business. 

That said, I'm putting all future professionals on shorter and shorter leashes. The moment they veer off course, and insist that I'm the one not participating, done. I suggest that since you want to advocate for your own mental health, you do something similar."
CBT,exylmma,t1_exyi85u,1566653694.0,"Don't get me wrong. I find the mental health community to be composed largely of people with more compassion than competency.

Therapists recently have tried to test pet theories about the ultimate root cause of my issues, and when I'd resist, throw up their hands as if I said no to everything they tried. Which I did, because they tried almost nothing. 

I wasn't dismissing you when I said trust issues. Trust issues can be massive and complicated; they don't need to be ""simple "". And if you're afraid of a method, simply because you can't see how it can't be misused, then trust issues are almost certainly at the heart of your resistance. 

I was leveling with you about the nature of cbt, to try and clear up the distaste you have for the concept. Speaking of which, your response doesn't mention cbt at all. Mainly bad experiences that seem to have nothing to do with whatever approach these hacks used.

We clearly both need to find a higher level of care, which is an uphill battle you know as well as I do. But if you think an actually competent professional isn't gonna attempt cbt or something similar, you're in for a lot of disappointment."
CBT,exwuqiu,t3_cuke0p,1566625436.0,"I think you're looking for validation. You want to hear that you're not wrong. And guess what? You're not. 

CBT and psychological manipulation tools such as gaslighting both exist for the same purpose: to actively modify one's thinking to achieve a real world result. That you've made that connection on your own is impressive. The disconnect arises from your inability to distinguish between the two. 

There's a reason for that. Gaslighting, and similar tactics, IS CBT. And I don't mean that in some irresponsibly hyperbolic way. Taken literally,  the term cognitive behavioral training can be seen as the mechanism by which gaslighting conditions people to accept further abuses.

Of course, CBT proper differs vastly from psychological manipulation, foremost in that it asks you to voluntarily work to train your thoughts. Obviously, the tactics are dramatically different as well. You're supposed to accept a new thought process that will reduce distress, and provide a more positive outlook on your world. With gaslighting, you are subtly twisted into believing things that allow others to selfishly use and mistreat you. 

If you believe that CBT is dangerous because of its relationship to more insidious approaches, then you have to also believe that a therapist can manipulate you without it. You clearly have trust issues, and I can see why. My own small direct experience with cbt has shown me that therapist and patient have to be on the exact same page before proceeding with any behavior or thought modification."
