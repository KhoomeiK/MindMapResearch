After we both finished school we went our seperate ways and lost contact seeing as he moved and went to a completely different school than I did.

unpopularopinion,fakryzk,t3_e9mbho,1576172161.0,"I grew up with the SHAYTARDS, as a kid I thought they were the perfect family. I never expected things to turn out the way they are today, it was always the good moments displayed, as things normally go on YouTube and I thought that was how life was. No bad, just all the good. I loved them, I loved their life, but as I grew older whilst watching them, I begun to realize it was all being glorified. Don't get me wrong, they all seem like such lovely people, but I started to realize just how... different things were to what they showed in all their videos. Then all this news came out about the father of the family, Shay, having alcohol problems and cheating on his wife and whatever the hell else.  I was an adult when all this news came out, but it still broke my heart to hear it, because they used to be a big part of my life.

Whilst I don't keep up with them much now, I hope the best for the kids in this situation. Having your parents split and go through troubles is hard. But, it seems as though both parents are being civil for their kids, and rightly so. These whole turn of events certainly pushed me a different way when it comes to family vlog channels. I'll never take them as seriously as I did when I was young."
