If the cuts are rather new, i will ask what happened. Self harm is something that scares me extremely, which is why I ask why they do it. Of course I don’t except a clear answer, just a hint if they might be suicidal or how worried I really should be. 

I don’t know how else to react tbh and I don’t want to (or maybe I can’t) ignore it.

The worst time was when they cut themselves badly and it triggered a lot of bad memories in me. This resulted in a lot of crying (on my side) and me trying to figure out why they self harmed. They tried to explain it to me and I think I got a better understanding of the whole situation, which definitely changed my view on this topic. It didn’t change the fact that I’m worried and that I want to help but I don’t cry about this anymore and I don’t react that extremely anymore either."
selfharm,fqnj64r,t1_fqmwub9,1589495795.0,Thank you! I do care a lot and I really wish I could do more than offering my help and being there for them.

When that hits really hard I really need to get out and go somewhere. I prefer to drive to a town around 250km (155miles) from here. This usually helps me calm down again"

I will try and hope they won’t be upset about it"
