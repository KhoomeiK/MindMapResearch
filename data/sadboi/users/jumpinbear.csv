If she asks why, I know that it’s because she isn’t empathetic to my problems, makes it about her, and has shared intimate details of my life to people who don’t deserve to know. It’s about being in a trusting relationship and the broken trust is what it comes down to (for me at least). I hope this helps."

ptsd,ffyb53k,t3_evu2ou,1580342243.0,"Hi, I punched and yelled at my ex-BF in my sleep!

I wasn’t diagnosed with PTSD until after we broke up but lemme tell ya, getting to sleep alone did WONDERS once we split. I found his interventions on my sleep talking/movements disrespectful to my sleep cycle because I wouldn’t be fully awake until he had woken me. 

This was obviously complicated because he also deserved a good night sleep but he didn’t see sleeping separately as an option. If your GF wants to go home, even in the middle of the night, I don’t see what you can offer that’s better than her own bed, without worry. I can only assume you have the best intentions and want to help, but I know from my own experience that if I want to go home and someone asks me to stay, I’m going to be pissed.

Lastly, you do need to talk to her. Let her lead the conversation. Let her make decisions about where and how she sleeps. It seems like the current set up is burdening both of you greatly.

Edit: I feel like I missed a critical part of your question. I’m not a doctor but I seriously doubt you’re suppressing her nightmares. It is so much more complicated than that and really not your job to figure out."

adultsurvivors,et2p5po,t3_c9snum,1562420160.0,"Gotta admit, this doesn’t totally seem like the right sub but since I don’t know what is, here’s what I think. 

I have no idea how much of this will be helpful to you and I certainly mean no offense by any of it. 

First of all, I think all kinds of sexual experimentation are totally natural and prone to come up in college. Sexual relations between two men is extra stigmatized in our culture and no doubt, at least some of what you feel, no matter how you identify at this point, is linked to growing up in a homophobic climate. I’m sorry you had/have to deal with any responses to what happened that falls under this category. 

I don’t think the question here is whether or not you were the abuser or the abused. If you feel you were violated in one way or another, you’re allowed to feel that way and trust that emotion. It sounds like this other person was forward in a way that was unwanted and that in itself can feel like a violation. 

Mostly, I think you should talk to a therapist if you’ve got one. Please don’t pigeon-hole yourself into black and white questions about what happened—sexual abuse is commonly much more complex than that in many ways, even in events where it can be easily and obviously boiled down to abuser/survivor."
adultsurvivors,et2nnrv,t3_c9pqd6,1562419505.0,"Yes to all of this. Recently I also went through a phase where I was incredibly angry at one of my abusers for probably never thinking about me while I am re traumatized all the time by thoughts about them. 

I would really like more PTSD materials to read. Some that are not geared at veterans would be great—I’m so glad that people are funding projects that help give veterans the support they deserve when dealing with PTSD and simultaneously, I very much some time and resources could go toward more SA PTSD help. 

But yeah. I have decided to give up on intimate relationships completely for now. On top of flashbacks, I’m on an SSRI that lowers my libido and I literally just can’t be near people because it feels like they’re using me."
