Even then when she went in she couldn‚Äôt get him out and they had to make the incision wider and pull him out backwards! So it was a tough experience which also came after 3 days of failed inductions. I don‚Äôt get why people think c-sections are easy or not really giving birth!

beyondthebump,fl83pae,t3_fn5ae9,1584915233.0,Lack of sleep does really bad things to you. I was you when my son was 4 months. I would lose my temper and have to stop myself from yelling or worse. When he was 9 months we ended up doing sleep training. I know many people are against it but it was something that worked for us. My son took to it very well and I started to get sleep again. After a while I realized that I wasn‚Äôt as angry with him. He‚Äôd cry or act out and I was able to deal with it more calmly.

FormulaFeeders,fl6s99w,t1_fl6pln1,1584881742.0,I was the same. I hated it so so much.
FormulaFeeders,fl6s2ij,t3_fmwgii,1584881564.0,"I feel the same way. The entire thing is so incredibly uncomfortable to me, I honestly don‚Äôt understand how it is so common/popular (I mean, I understand the benefits to it..). When my son was born I told myself I would do it even though it made me so uncomfortable that I even hated learning about it (videos, books, etc) while pregnant. Oddly enough my son didn‚Äôt latch right and seemed to HATE doing it. I tried lactation consultants but nothing helped. I hated every second of it. Instead of feeling empowering it felt degrading to me. I ended up pumping for 2 months until my supply dried up. I even hated the pumping, I often cried while doing it. I don‚Äôt know why I am so different, I‚Äôm not a prude by any means? I really just feel like breasts are sexual things and it‚Äôs hard for me to switch my thinking? It makes me feel vulnerable and disgusting. I also believe that I have D-MER where I have a bad chemical reaction to the process of milk let down. As I said I would cry while pumping. Sometimes I would even feel suicidal. 
So yeah, it‚Äôs not for me. I even get super uncomfortable around other women breastfeeding. It seems just so private but people just do it out in the open. It‚Äôs all such an awkward world for me. If I have a second baby I think I will just go straight to formula. I can‚Äôt put myself though that again."
