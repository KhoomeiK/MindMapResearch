Whatcouldgowrong,fqpeky9,t1_fqpagv9,1589544324.0,"Sorry, I wasn't being sarcastic, may have worded that wrong.
We have a couple things. CPP is the Canadian pension plan, which is something that is automatically deducted from t1 employees cheques. We max out at 2500 dollars a year and there is a maximum payout once we retire. Another thing we pay into is called OAP or old age pension. It's need less off of what we've played into it but payed once we claim it when we retire. The there's all the others like RRSPs,(voluntary pension plans that are based off the market). RRSPs are a things that unions fight for and they right to have employers match contributions. Here anyways. Sounds nice on paper eh."

As soon as she turned around, my sandal caught a rock and when I whipped my foot forward to comply, the rock flew forward hitting my mother square in the center of the back. 

She noticed the rock thrown right into the center of her back, and so did I. There was nothing I could do or say to dissuade her that I had picked up a rock and thrown it straight at her(which I hadn't). I took quite a beating. Which in her eyes, I deserved. 

Meh, I was shit back then. I deserved it."
