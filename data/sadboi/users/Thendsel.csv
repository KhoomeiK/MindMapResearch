My problems still exist in my mid 30s, but I’ve come to terms with it in the sense that I don’t blame a whole gender and fill my heart with anger towards them over the jealousy.

The problem is that line of logic can be used for just about everything. Drinking is a big one that Christians like to use, but playing games, having sex are also popular ones.

Got kept in for the bare minimum time and talked my way out into getting released after it was clear that nobody was going to help me or set up to help me deal with what I thought was the root cause of my issues.

Unfortunately, because all I could articulate was the feelings from the surface problem, they put me on meds I couldn’t afford and botched the setup for the outpatient help they set up for me (not that I could afford the copays for the insurance for that help anyway).

I’ve heard identical medications from different companies can provide different side effects, so I’m wondering if this is true for this buspirone. At least it went away for you, I still struggle with it, but it’s never been anything I can’t work through. Still a good drug overall."

I feel worthless most of the time, since I’m in my mid 30s and dependent on family for living necessities since all of my meager income goes to paying down debt I piled up in the relationship (thanks to my ex sabotaging my attempt to go back to college while we were together, along with undiagnosed ADHD). Who would want a person of my age with no social skills stuck in a menial retail job, no regular access to a car, and no disposable income? I haven’t even bothered with online dating for that reason."

Run, run, run like the wind. With that kind of guilt trip, things will only get worse if you succumb to it even once. Next thing you know, she will guilt trip you into moving in with them, which will lead to you basically working 24/7/365 with no bump in pay. Or she will start dragging her feet on paying you on time. Something like that. I got into that situation with my ex. The mom was too busy, too stressed to be a parent. My ex basically ended up being the mother, and then the ex manipulated me into basically being the father figure for the child and having to financially support the child (long story, but that drove me to the brink of bankruptcy and the manipulation is why she’s my ex). So to reiterate, do not let this woman manipulate you. It’s a slippery slope, and if she learns she use guilt to control you, she will use it time and time again to gradually hand over the parent role to you."

ADHD,eyqef2z,t1_eyq3yfq,1567339829.0,"I grew up the same way. My big thing was that I would complain that I couldn’t focus enough to do any of the reading material in English class in middle and high school. Not because I had any sort of learning disability like dyslexia or the likes, but because I didn’t have the ability to read long enough to grasp concepts without losing focus in my head. But, there were plenty of classmates who were the stereotypical hyperactive, whereas I was not. So I slipped between the cracks. I was treated for my anxiety and depression for the longest time, but not ADHD. It wasn’t until this year, in my mid 30s, two failed attempts at college (although the second time was more due to a bad relationship I was in), when I finally got diagnosed and started treatment. Alas, I’m stuck in low wage retail work (full time, but still) and have student loan debt from my last attempt at college, so going back isn’t an option with likely no way to be able to afford it unless I somehow get a hold of a six-figure chunk of change."

Sure, I’m sure both offensive and defensive linemen have a fairly good amount of muscle on them, but they’re still probably obese and have a lot of fat. That can’t be healthy. Not saying they have to be in tip top shape, but the league shouldn’t be encouraging obesity either."

But my sister kept forgetting to pass that on to me so that I could forward it on to my psychologist to get properly diagnosed and then treated by my psychiatrist. 

Just some advice stemming from personal experience: make sure you keep any medicine you’re prescribed in a safe location, preferably your home. I kept my medicine in personal belongings at work just to realize three months in that someone was going through my things when I wasn’t looking and stealing 5-7 pills every month. Since I started leaving it at home, it really cut down on the side effects now that I can take it regularly without having to skip doses once or twice a week to make it through to my next refill."
ADHD,exsuugj,t3_cu04iy,1566557346.0,"I had the same problem in school. I gave up on reading books at an early age because of it. In retrospect, this should have been the red flag that got me tested for ADHD. I barely made it through high school english classes as a result. Cliff Notes was my friend, and even that only bumped me up from failing to just barely passing on average. I was much better at writing and composition, and that also played a part in concealing my issues. Unfortunately, I went to a very large high school. The only people that got flagged for ADHD were those that were a disruption in class, whereas I would just quietly check out and retreat into my mind."
