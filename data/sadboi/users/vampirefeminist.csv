HongKong,fqoh1o9,t1_fqog0du,1589515065.0,"Appreciate you asking for more detail. My story is told in the perspective of someone like me—a Chinese-Canadian with Hong Kong heritage but was born and raised in Canada. I don't know if you've heard, but we overseas kids have received mixed messages about the pro-democracy protests. My parents (born in HK, immigrated in the 80s) get their news from TVB (the only Chinese language channel here), so their perspective has been pretty anti-protest leaning. They are not pro-CCP by any means, but they are very disilusioned by the protests. They are vehemently against violence and believe many young people are being manipulated. They also think Western news sources ""twist"" the story to make China be the bad guy.

\[Side note: China being the ""bad guy"" probably means a different thing to us than to you. In places like U.S. and Canada, they don't care if you're Hong Kong or Taiwanese or whatever. If you look Chinese you are Chinese and there have been several racist attacks against us. So it's kind of understandable that my parents are a bit more defensive about China's image overseas.\]

I, consuming mostly Western news, tend to see the protesters as the good guys and the police/government as the bad guys. Sometimes my perspective and my parents' perspectives clash.

Right, back to the story: please note it is written for a Western audience (aka white people). It is told from the perspective of someone like me who visits Hong Kong for a sombre family event and has to deal with all the protests. My main character encounters both police brutality (unheard of in her home country) as well as older relatives who are anti-protest. Thus, while I do think my general tone is pro-protest, I do uncover several ""flaws"" of the pro-democracy movement. This is representative of my personal experience being tugged by both sides.

Sorry, that ended up being a longer ramble than I intended but I hope it gives you much needed context."

I would personally champion a movement to bring more men into the conversation. Feminism is NOT just for women. Feminism is for men. To encourage men to express themselves, ask for help, pursue what they love, feel safe, feel heard. A lot of misandry stems from men being yelled at by women from a young age and not really understanding why they are yelled at. No one learns from this.

I am a queer, female bodied person of colour with a history of mental illness. This makes me seem oppressed, but I am actually quite privileged. I grew up well off, I’m educated, and I live in a diverse city with universal healthcare and support systems.

Personally, I think they're just being classic Baby Boomers and not as frightened of the future as we are because they don't have to live it.

>I remember what Hong Kong was like before 1997, before 2015. It's pretty painful looking back and seeing how much potential has been lost.

This is PRECISELY one of the main themes I want to explore in my story. Thank you for putting it so succinctly. I want to show westerners that Hong Kong really isn't that different from a multicultural, cosmopolitan western city like Toronto or LA. It is extremely modern, with a high standard of living and a one-of-a-kind fascinating culture that is a playful mix of east and west. I want westerners to know that in a place similar to us, the freedoms we take for granted can be so easily taken away.

I too feel some responsibility towards my ancestral people. I have a difficult time calling Hong Kong my home and my people because I was not born there, was not educated there, and have not contributed any of my taxes, for example, to there. I am only connected there ancestrally. So on one hand, I feel ill-equipped to speak on behalf of the Hong Kong people. On the other hand, I feel a responsibility to bring awareness to the issue to my western friends and neighbours.

When I ask my parents what they think of the situation, their go-to is ""This is the reason we immigrated!"" But like you, I don't want to simply run away. My family had the privilege of immigrating because they were relatively well-off financially, educated, and know English. Plenty of Hong Kongers do not have this luxury."
HongKong,f8mhu2h,t1_f8m61jt,1574631526.0,"Hi! First of all, thank you for your comment. For some reason, your comment is the only one I can read at this moment in time and the others have been hidden. I think it may be a modding issue. Let's hope it's not suppression of free speech, though I wouldn't be surprised...

Onto your comment. You've raised some very good points, but I think you may have misinterpreted my story. I do not wish to write a story ""about the protests"" precisely because of the point you raised: a story about the Hong Kong protests from 10,000km away is not genuine. I strongly believe such a story would be better written by the Hong Kong people themselves, not me. I am merely an outsider looking in, and my story will be from this outsider perspective.

The plot of my story as it stands is about one family dealing with the aftermath of a loved one's death, so it's very intimate and not really connected to the protests at all. I merely intend the protests to be a backdrop. That being said, I do want to put the protagonist in the uncomfortable position of talking to her elders and seeing that their narrative of what's going on is extremely different from the narrative she receives from mainstream western media. I don't want to push a conversion of ideologies by saying ""Bob used to think this way, now he knows better to think this way"" because in my experience, being overly and obviously didactic is not as powerful as showing ugly things as what they are: ugly and frustrating.

Because my audience will mainly be Western (rarely do people outside of Canada want to read Canadian literature lol), my main goal would simply be awareness. Plenty of westerners do not care about what goes on outside their bubble, but because there is such a large diaspora community of Chinese-Canadians here, this is something they should definitely care about. I want to educate them about the unique culture of Hong Kong and really show a Hong Kong that is unique, beautiful and fascinating...a beauty that is threatened with extinction. What gets me the most is that Hong Kong really isn't that different from a city like mine, what with the modernized, high standard of living and generally well-educated and professional populace. It's scary when you think about a place so similar to your home being in such danger. Really reminds me you of how fragile your own freedom is...

Anyway, I hope that gives a bit more context as to what I'm trying to accomplish? In summation, my story is not ""about"" the protests, it is about one family's journey and how conversation about the protests permeate their relationships to one another and the protagonist's own sense of identity as somewhere between outsider and insider. 

Ideally, of course I would talk to Hong Kongers in Hong Kong, but that is not feasible for me at this moment, hence I'm taking to Reddit. Thanks again for taking the time to comment."

I had a full-time well-paid content writing job, but it was a shitty company, a terrible commute, and I absolutely hated it.

So I ditched it and swung the complete opposite direction. I took a pay cut and now work just 15 hours a week at a wholesome non-profit doing communications and marketing.

I justified this move by also taking night classes in design. Well, mostly I did that to justify not working as much to my parents. But I genuinely like design, have done a lot of design work, and wanted a formal qualification so I could potentially market it as a freelance skill.

I also started freelance writing. Began writing seriously about last week and made my first $7 on Medium. Which is breadcrumbs but at least it's SOMETHING.

I wouldn't do this, however, if I didn't have a pretty solid support system. I'm fairly lucky in that I have a nice bedrock of savings. I'm only giving myself until the end of my design program to focus this much on writing. And then I'll make a decision as to whether I should make it a way to subsist."

Damnthatsinteresting,f1xu8y2,t1_f1urxgg,1569804178.0,"That’s totally understandable. My city has very good public transport, but the quality takes a nosedive once you get to the suburbs. I even notice a pattern that all my friends who grew up in the city never bothered to learn how to drive (or at least learned later in life cos they weren’t in a rush) while suburb kids all knew how to drive"

Because if so I have a problem."
saplings,eyqxtie,t3_cy6pks,1567356293.0,"Get a vape. I have the MFLB and I can literally vape in my bedroom with my parents on the other side of the wall :)

It's not 100% odourless, but if your parents don't know weed very well they probably won't recognize it if your bedroom has a trace scent of funk. Open some windows and the smell will dissipate within half an hour at most."

They had several of these signs scattered around the exhibits, next to stuff like fish that change genders and gay sheep. This was in the bird section. I think they did it for Pride but I hope they leave there forever."

RATS,ewqmab2,t1_ewqlrij,1565670350.0,"I'm not opposed to pest control, even pest control methods that kill the animal.

What I AM opposed to is unnecessarily torturing animals and then glorifying said torture on YouTube. If you have a pest problem, use instant kill methods. If glue traps are the only thing that works, kill the mice as soon as possible. DON'T watch them languish in pain and delight in their suffering."
Drugs,ewbvp4j,t1_ewbvdc2,1565273049.0,"Fair enough. Psychosis is no joke. Get checked out and stay safe, OP!

While I have the chance I probably should add that while I do not have a psychotic illness I do have medically diagnosed OCD that is treated with a cocktail of drugs on its own. Don’t think it’s related to cannabis though as I’ve had it since childhood."
Drugs,ewbr2vg,t1_ewaug3w,1565271027.0,"Hmm, I remember seeing a documentary once where they scanned high people’s brains and their high brains looked almost identical to schizophrenic brains.

I have similar experiences with OP and have no family history of psychosis nor any psychotic symptoms when I’m sober. Been smoking cannabis regularly for around 2-3 years now. Sometimes I get “peripheral” hallucinations where I think I see something in the corner of my eye but there’s nothing there. Other times I look at something (like a piece of trash) and think it’s something else (like an squirrel) at first. So far, relatively benign stuff.

If OP has a family history of mental illness then yes I definitely think they should proceed with caution. But if not I wouldn’t worry tooooo much? For me when I’m high and I go into a anxious thought loop I just remind myself that I’m high and to deal with the anxiety in the morning when I’m sober. Usually it’s nothing.

Ofc I’m not a doctor so take my words with a grain of salt. Take care, OP."
Drugs,ewbq8tq,t3_cngwrm,1565270661.0,"Yup, you’ve described almost my exact first experiences with marijuana edibles. Especially the music and visual connection. I used to imagine I was soaring through buildings. 

Miss that feeling. Now my tolerance is pretty high so I don’t get pulled from reality that much anymore. If you like the experience try to space out your weed intake. I take a tolerance break now and then so my body can reset."

Definitely feel better after defecation, but doesn’t everyone? Stools have always been the same."
AskDocs,etp0l3g,t1_etp0giw,1563042495.0,"I don’t think it’s related to anxiety because I’m gassy no matter what. Ever since I started my antidepressants I’ve been fairly relaxed too, but the gas hasn’t changed."
