What ticked me off most of all was that at least in the DVD musical, there's a lot of relationships between the characters going on in the background. You get a feel of who the characters are in relation to others ( RTT's and Mestopholes friendship being the most glaring example ).

In this every character seemed to exist in a vacuum. All the introduction songs were sung by the characters in question, leaving it kinda vague what their relation to everyone else was. 

Also they just plain got the feel of some of the characters wrong. They completely missed the mark with Jenny, making her into a kind of weird uncomfortable fat joke. Kinda same for Bustopher Jones - I always feel like these two were supposed to be respected even if they are a bit funny but the movie just painted them as being kinda delusional.

samharris,farw7ly,t1_faqdnj1,1576320806.0,"With minimal woowoo, I think what we call spirituality is the ability to quiet down, pay attention to all of your experience, not just the most intense things. To give an extreme example, your little toe catches on the table leg and while yes, there's pain, everything else is still happening as well. Doesn't have to be that extreme, just right now, stop looking at this text and feel into what is happening in your *direct experience*, before you think or analyze about it? What is your experience before you explain it through your story about yourself and the way you understand the world? 
It's hard to do but I think it's vital for good mental health. You say ""people get by fine"" but there's two things. First, they may be able to do this intuitively, they just don't consider it spirituality. They know how to quiet down. They don't need to have extreme peak experiences for it to bring about mental stability. Second, people are less fine than they think. Just because they can stick to their routine with a smile on doesn't mean that something couldn't send them spiraling into depression etc. 

People who have learned to quiet down like this and do it by practice ( meditators, religious people ) have had these ""opening up"" experiences that they then explain within the context that is available to them. For example, Christians may say they felt the presence of God, Buddhists may say they felt the no-thingness, Hindus may say they felt the absolute and so on.
