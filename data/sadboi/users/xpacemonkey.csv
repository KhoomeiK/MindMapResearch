I'll tell you what worked for me, use what's useful for you. Your parents are sick in the head. They are not able to change, their emotional maturity is the same of a 5 year old. I see you're not exactly excited about starting the process of self discovering and self healing, but it needs to start somewhere, and you have the gift of being a real person and being able to change what you don't like about yourself. They don't. They're not real, they are an artificial image.

But let's focus on the speak up part: one day you'll be free from your Nparents and you'll be able to speak your truth. At first, when I left the Nhouse and new people asked about my parents, I used to say they died on a car crash so they would stop asking. But I started telling some known people that I was estranged because my mom is crazy. Then I realized how much telling the truth relieved me. But I can't say people will understand that a mother can be very bad to her children - I still have to listen to the she-is-your-mom-and-everything-she-does-is-for-love line, but now I can say no, she doesn't love me or anyone but herself and I'm fine here living my life without her, thanks.
Your time will come, be strong until there. It looked like infinite hell for me when I was a minor. I recommend you keep track of all the abuse you can register (and where she won't find), because once you're free, she might try to gaslight you until you think she wasn't too bad.
