I've been really good at maintaining by quitting drinking, getting enough sleep, hydration and taking my meds properly but my stress and depression have been off the charts lately. It led to me kinda freaking out a bit on my crush cause I got paranoid that she hated me and was just being nice by talking to me. I haven't done anything like that in years and now I feel like shit. Feels like I relapsed even tho I didn't drink."
