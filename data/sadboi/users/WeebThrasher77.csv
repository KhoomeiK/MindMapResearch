talesofneckbeards,fo2qezh,t3_g5c9sx,1587471371.0,"This is a tricky post to reply to, since I know people who fall into your state of mind on this issue, where these creepy neckbeards with the ""asian fetish"" ruin their self esteem and make them feel uncomfortable, which I totally understand and sympathize with. However, I also know people personally who take a different approach, where they embrace their asian features similar to what you described, and don't feel offended by being ""fetishized"" unless it is from a genuine creep. I think that logic comes from the separation between objectified in a weird way, to just someone who feels attracted to certain features that just so happen to come from a certain race. So they feel flattered that people find their features attractive. Maybe it's because I live in a multicultural area where it is common for people of different races to date and be attracted to one another, so people have a preference of who they find attractive. It is not racist to be attracted to people of different races, and expressing that is not racist. However, being an overall creep about it, and believing false stereotypes that fit a fantasy as you described as well, is definitely not okay. An example is when a friend of mine acted like an idiot and went ""I want an asian woman bc they are submissive, conservative, does this and that etc"" vs people that might just say ""I'm attracted to asian women"" and leave it at that and don't dwell on stereotypes. 

TLDR: big difference between being a racist dumbass vs simple preferences in attractiveness. other people share your feelings, you're not alone."

LearningDisabilities,faiqm98,t1_faimi1t,1576114285.0,I actually live in Canada however most of the services you described are also available here so that‚Äôs good. The thing is I was mistakenly diagnosed with autism when I was very young but then they revoked the diagnosis after they discovered my behaviour and psychological issues growing up were based on generalized anxiety and NOT autism. However my actual learning abilities were never really questioned until I took my psycho educational assessment two months ago and they concluded that I had a learning disability. So essentially I was treated for anxiety for years but never knew I had a learning disability until much later. Which hurt me a little bc the way I was learning made studying so difficult and got me into some bad habits and coupled with my anxiety made me procrastinate a lot. Now that I have this diagnosis I can actually build better habits that reflect on my strengths and can help me study and work more efficiently.

LearningDisabilities,faefx3m,t1_faebudo,1576000096.0,Huge apologies if I was being misleading! So according to the psychologist who diagnosed me I have a non verbal learning disability. So my strengths are in verbal abilities with my visual spatial abilities being not so good. That‚Äôs the simplified version of it. My psychologist phrased it as a learning disability in the non verbal domain. I am unsure if there‚Äôs any other distinction or method of referring to my disability that is more accurate that Im unaware of? I only recently got this diagnosis so it‚Äôs still a bit of a shock to me.
