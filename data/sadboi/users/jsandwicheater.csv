EatingDisorders,f3jglv3,t3_dfoh0w,1570952391.0,"I think it is very brave of you to be open with your boyfriend about your disorder.

No matter what, this will impact your relationship. It is just whether or not it impacts it in a positive or negative way, and this is in both of your control. 

Having a strong support network is one of the cornerstones of recovery. It sounds to me as if, unfortunately, you don't have a lot of support from your family. 

When I first began my journey of recovery, I was exactly the same as you. I couldn't imagine anything changing - in fact, I think I wanted it to remain the same, because I felt safe. But this is just fear disguised as safety. You are already overcoming this fear by sharing a part of your self with your boyfriend.

Another thing to remember is that eating disorders aren't one size fits all - everyone is different and they manifest in different ways. They are complex mental illnesses and cannot be narrowed down to something as simple as the appearance of thinness. It is your thoughts that are causing this disorder, not your appearance. 

You need to seek the appropriate help from someone who is skilled in this area. As lovely as your boyfriend is for offering his help and guidance, this may end up causing unnecessary drama in your relationship. Whilst he might think he can learn to understand - he will never know what it is like to suffer through the constant negative thoughts that come along with an eating disorder.

I wish you luck in your recovery."
