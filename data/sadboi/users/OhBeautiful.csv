casualiama,fr3d5tm,t3_gmarpf,1589854862.0,I’m agoraphobic and it definitely was very hard for me in middle school as well. I missed a looot of school in eighth grade. I am so happy and proud of you for overcoming your obstacles!!
DesignHomeGame,fr228q6,t3_gm0hzm,1589829906.0,I also went this direction!

neopets,foopou3,t3_g8lh80,1587943839.0,Working on a Maraquan paint brush for my sons Lutari. I have everything I really need goal wise. Really excited for us to reach the milestone together.
misfitstv,fonsjh8,t3_g8geuy,1587925618.0,It’s really the only show that still makes me laugh when I rewatch it!
neopets,fonb9tj,t1_fonazxa,1587916137.0,"He so far has a Blumaroo he named after himself (so cute) and we painted Tyrannian, a blue Scorchio and his blue Lutari.  He was asking me about Hissis yesterday so I think we may make one on the 4th.  Way back years ago during the pet purge I created a pet with his nickname as its name that I think I want to adopt to him and would be a really cute Hissi!"
neopets,fonafap,t1_fon84vd,1587915640.0,"He's very happy he joined right before Lutari day and got a Lutari.  Thankfully I have some NP saved up to help him, thank you."
neopets,fonabwd,t1_fon6xly,1587915586.0,Thank you!
neopets,fon7v2x,t1_fon5cqy,1587914132.0,I wind up going on month long hiatuses sometimes and am pleasantly surprised when I return to good stocks. I think it’s a great long-term way to make NP. Though I am frequently conflicted about selling them. It’s something he and I can learn more about together.
neopets,fon47x6,t1_fomzwrn,1587911852.0,"I have experience training for the BD and have started explaining the process to him, and I think he’d really like the whole “fighting” aspect. Honestly there is so much about Neopets that I enjoy that I am trying to let him guide me into what he likes. He really like anything interactive with his pets and reading books to them might be a great start because there are so many. He likes to draw so I’ve encouraged him to enter the beauty contest too!"
neopets,fomujhl,t3_g855g1,1587904276.0,This stuff is great!
neopets,fomugsx,t1_fomty7v,1587904209.0,I forgot completely about game avatars! Thanks for the great ideas!
neopets,fomu5de,t1_fomcu0m,1587903913.0,"Very good point. It happened so fast, I didn’t realize he had even sent the price through in his shop and it was gone. It was definitely a learning experience for him. I am trying to teach him how item values work, and will have to teach him some Neopets etiquette as well. I’m just glad it didn’t bother him too much and that I have the np to help him out when he wants things."
neopets,fomtmxn,t1_fom4a6f,1587903427.0,"Ah you’re so nice! I can’t wait to show him when he wakes up. Thank you so much, we will be paying it forward in some way."
neopets,fomtiku,t1_fomdcvm,1587903309.0,"It was the Festival of Neggs prize charm. I didn’t actually get one or I would have just given it to him to sell. I was thinking that about avatars, but he can’t use the Neoboards because he is too young. Do you think it might be something we could do together anyway? He honestly really loves to tell his Petpet he thinks it’s a good boy haha."
neopets,folpwi3,t1_folps63,1587867701.0,Haha I told him to let me help him price things from now on. He’s okay with it because he really didn’t like the item and just wanted to sell it. Ah to be 9 again!
DesignHomeGame,fnomap0,t3_g31fvq,1587128858.0,I really really like this!
TherapeuticKetamine,fnm1j8q,t3_g2he93,1587063464.0,I just had a treatment. With my mask on I was so disoriented it was awful. Also I was alone and it was not as uncomfortable as I thought. I FaceTimed my husband as soon as I was awake and that really helped. Thankful I can get my treatment during this time and that my doctors office is handing out masks and gloves upon arrival. Have a good treatment tomorrow!
TherapeuticKetamine,fnkymue,t3_g2ak0k,1587043218.0,I take Zofran before my appointment. I threw up after my first appointment so my doc prescribed it for me. You may be able to take it when you become nauseous.

MakeupAddiction,flnxxz1,t3_fpy2v4,1585327983.0,I have a similar eye color to you and love pink shadows. Looks really good and your blending is great!
Agoraphobia,fljxsuy,t1_fljeg9l,1585229419.0,This is exactly how I feel. Still trying to get past feeling down on myself again though. I keep forgetting it is actually the responsible thing to do.
DAE,flhmuhh,t1_flhmk3t,1585165657.0,"I am doing okay. Also going on walks and spending time outside. Thankfully when they reopen I have a job waiting for me, I am lucky."
DAE,flhmbm6,t1_flhgr7n,1585165376.0,"I can relate. Same situation, I finally got a job after three years of being in a bad place and on my “first day” they had to close. 

How are you feeling?"
RoomPorn,fl8ta2m,t3_fjo3d0,1584931758.0,What style would you call this?
TherapeuticKetamine,fkssq4t,t3_fkezlv,1584497517.0,I have not had any repressed memories or traumas (I know I have blocked out a lot) but my anxiety and depression has greatly lifted. It took a bit to find the correct dose but once we did it has been excellent. I have had nine infusions. Haven’t tried lsd or shrooms with because I really feel the ketamine alone is helping.

neopets,fkekngl,t1_fkekbp3,1584115144.0,Thank you! I just checked for my favorite species (Blumaroo) and their candy look is not quite as cool but steampunk is awesome! Your Kougra is so pretty. Congratulations!

OldSchoolCool,fke81kw,t1_fkd4yje,1584107459.0,She was!! The coolest Nana a girl could ask for. I like to think I take after her and am also cool.
OldSchoolCool,fke7zok,t1_fkd5eys,1584107423.0,"I am going to have it enlarged. I just found this among some family photos we were given. We were very very close and I miss her so much, this is one of my favorite shots of her."
OldSchoolCool,fke7r71,t1_fkd7emv,1584107264.0,Definitely 1954! The photo is dated on the back and it coincides with her age. Maybe she was just way ahead of her time!
RedditLaqueristas,fkatgy6,t3_fh6lj8,1584019059.0,"I just bought a cute Dashing Diva set from Walmart, excited to try them. I usually use Incoco, Coconut or Color Street and I really love the patterns and easy application but always looking for other options."
TherapeuticKetamine,fixzngl,t1_fixifez,1582829588.0,"I believe I may be confused by what my dr was saying. At the time of my first appointment I weighed 150 lbs, my last appointments dose was .55 mg/kg. This appointment was 97.5mg. My next appointment will be .75 mg/kg and will come to 107mg (I lost 10 lbs woo!)

Sorry for the confusion? Does that sound more correct to you?

Edit. I’m an idiot. It’s mg/kg not mg/lb. major facepalm. This only brings me to 47mg. I’m not complaining because I do feel as though this treatment will be successful as I’m feeling the same way I did after my first successful treatment."
TherapeuticKetamine,fiww7rv,t1_fiw0jo2,1582805498.0,"I am going to make sure we continue to raise the dose at this point because I also feel as if it is low. Have my next treatment today and plan to discuss it with him. I’m not upset he is being cautious with the dose, he just hasn’t pushed me to raise it. It I think he feels this is too low for me now as well. I will let you know how I continue. I am a few inches taller than you and a bit heavier so hearing this is concerning. Thank you for your input!"
TherapeuticKetamine,fiuon1a,t3_f9xnz4,1582745376.0,"I am on my sixth treatment and felt great results a week after the first treatment and now nothing. Going up to eight and raising the dose a bit. I was at 35 mg, now going up to 47 and wondering if perhaps the dose is incorrect. I have only raised it once since starting. Have you responded at all to the treatments or just nothing?"
AlkalineTrio,fic376m,t3_f7k1qz,1582336497.0,Love mine! I have never seen another pair. Really glad I’ve taken care of them.
RandomActsofMakeup,fhoumr9,t1_fhnwttb,1581774401.0,I’ve been practicing on myself daily and I really think it helps. Also watching a variety of different tutorials have been great. You can do it!!

TherapeuticKetamine,fglqn5k,t1_fglhdeg,1580908328.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I believe I am going to try the nasal spray first, my doctor has no issue with me switching to IV but if I can be treated for less money that seems like a better option for me."
TherapeuticKetamine,fgkg7ln,t1_fgkfyim,1580864828.0,I think this is going to be the plan. I will be finding out tomorrow if it is covered. Thank you for your input.

Anxiety,fdlv8y5,t3_em0e7a,1578533297.0,I was clenching my jaw so much I started trying to move my tongue to a more natural position. Now instead of clenching I’m pushing my front teeth forward with my tongue. Hate it.
