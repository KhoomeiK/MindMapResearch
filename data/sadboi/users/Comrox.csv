college,fqxmow8,t3_gl25td,1589734675.0,"I was 19 when I got my license. I had my permit while still in high school but didn't take the test until the summer after my freshman year of college. 

When initially learning to drive in high school, I was terrified. I hated it so much. I was so afraid of getting into a crash and hurting myself or someone else. I'd do anything to get out of driving practice or put off driving. So that's why it took me a few years before I got my license. 

But even still, once I got my license, I rarely drove for a few years after. During college I lived on campus and never had my car there. Like you, I worked from home. I didn't need to drive, so I didn't.

I had to start driving more during the summers because I had internships. Public transportation in my area sucks, and my parents weren't going to drive me around. I gained more experience out of necessity. I was afraid initially and it took some time getting used to my new driving routes, but I did eventually get used to it. 

I started driving a lot more once I graduated. Because of my job, I had to drive a lot more frequently, with longer distances, than I was used to. I was also terrified of driving on the highway, but I had to start doing it. With time and experience, I realized I was no longer afraid of driving. It wasn't this thing I hated or was terrified or doing anymore. These days, I actually like driving. 

I don't regret that I waited to get my license, or that I barely drove after I got mine. I firmly believe no one should push you to drive before you're ready. Safety comes first. 

Having said that, in my area, I can't imagine graduating college with no driver's license and no driving experience. I needed to drive very soon after I graduated. Having to go through the long process of driving lessons / learning how to drive with someone, getting comfortable, taking the tests (and having to account for retakes), getting a car, etc. - it's a lot. I didn't have time for that when I graduated. 

You need to think about what kind of future you see yourself in, and if that's one you can get by in without driving. I know people who don't drive at all but they very rarely rely on other people to get them around. They live in cities with good public transportation. They bike, take the bus, Uber, use other public transport, etc. 

If you are set on not driving anytime soon, I would recommend trying to become more self-reliant. It sounds like your parents and grandparents are enabling you. You don't have to learn how to drive because they make it easy for you to not need to. If they suddenly stopped driving you around, what would you do? They are not always going to be there to drive you (and frankly, in my opinion, at a certain point it's not fair to keep asking them). You need to think about alternatives. You are an adult and it sounds like you're employed. At the least, I would try to be giving them money for gas or something, or start taking Uber / Lyft a few times a week so that you're not always relying on them. 

If you think about your future and think you may need to start driving one day, I would consider trying to start learning now or in the near future. In my experience, it's a lot easier to learn how to drive before you actually need to.

So if you're thinking about learning how to drive: 

**Practice, practice, practice.** You become a better, safer, and more confident driver the more you drive. No one is born an amazing driver. Driving will not get easier or less scary for you if you're not practicing enough. 

Study the driving manual, get your permit, and drive every single day if you can. Start in empty parking lots. Get used to the way the car feels, turns, and stops. Take as much time as you need to get used to this. If you don't have the money to get your own car right now, consider that you may be sharing a car with your parents or grandparents. This might be a good time to test out a few different cars (the ones they all drive). Every car will feel different, and I think it's important to establish that early on. 

When you're ready, move on to quiet, empty streets, such as neighborhoods with low speed limits. Consider practicing early in the morning or later in the evening when there's not much traffic. When you're just starting out, I would also keep distractions (such as the radio) to a minimum. 

Once you've conquered the quiet streets, move on to busier ones. Get used to traffic lights and multiple lanes. Get used to staying in your lane and switching lanes. Get used to other cars being around you. 

Start with mastering the few routes you need to know (how to get to campus, the grocery store, etc.). Give yourself plenty of time to get there. Once you have those down, try alternate routes to get to the same destination, and just get experience driving around your town and learning where everything is.

When you're ready, you should also be driving in less-than-ideal weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, etc.) to gain experience and learn how your car handles these different situations. You should also be getting plenty of practice driving at night, too, and practice parking in parking lots. 

Consistency in practice will help you become a better driver, and help you become comfortable quicker than if you drove less frequently. Again, drive every day if you can. At a certain point, you should be the one driving yourself everywhere you need to go. Your parents or grandparents will be supervising you (with your permit), but you should be the one behind the wheel. 

**Enroll in a driver's ed class.** Watch YouTube videos on driving. Subscribe to r/driving and r/drivinganxiety and post there. You're not alone. 

**Stop looking at statistics.** Stop reading about car crashes. It's good to have a little fear in you when you first start out because driving can be very dangerous and that fear can help you be a better (more cautious) driver, but too much fear is counterproductive. Yes, driving can be dangerous. Yes, people get into accidents. But millions of people also drive every day and they are just fine. You will be, too. 

**If your anxiety is that severe, look into therapy.** I don't think you're afraid of getting in a car crash, per se. If you were, you would avoid cars all together. But here you are, letting other people drive you around. It sounds more like you're not confident or trusting enough in your own abilities to avoid getting into a crash. This is something you can work on. This is something you can get better at. But you need to practice. You need to build up your confidence and experience as a driver in order to get there. You need to believe you can do this."

LifeAfterSchool,fmtogb7,t3_fxb68x,1586376243.0,"I would say income and parental support (or lack thereof) are the biggest factors in determining if someone moves right after college or not. 

The only reason I was able to move out after college (not directly after, but a few months after) was because I got a job offer that paid enough to support my cost of living. With regards to the move or my living expenses, I didn't receive any financial help from my parents. I was able to afford it on my own. If you have the option to stay at home / move back home, I would take that if your job doesn't pay enough to support you moving out comfortably (or if you don't have a job at all). You need a job that pays enough first. Especially if you're considering moving states or cities - I would not recommend moving anywhere without securing a job. 

I moved states because my job was in another city. I liked the prospects of my job and had no other options. I had no choice. I had a few thousand in savings but not a lot. I was terrified, but moving and starting a job in the city was also a lot more exciting and appealing to me then staying in my hometown. My life would have likely been a lot more dull, and both my professional and personal growth stunted, if I stayed there. 

So I went. I was fortunately able to stay with a friend for the first couple of weeks (with a very long commute, but you do what you have to do) until I was able to secure an apartment in the city where my job was located. And the rest is history. 

It's a risk, yes, but everything in life is a risk. I had a strong feeling the job would work out, but if it didn't, I would have just moved back home, or started looking for another job in the area. As long as you're not living paycheck to paycheck, you should ideally be putting away money in savings so that if you were to lose your job, you would be able to support yourself until you get another. The risks haven't been as high for me because I would just move back with family if I absolutely had to. So taking risks didn't seem that bad because worst case scenario, I just move back. 

Now... my living situation hasn't been glamorous. You take what you can get and you make do with it. I lived in an incredibly small apartment. The majority of my friends and people I know around my age either live with their parents, live with friends, or with significant others. I would imagine the majority of young adults who have moved out need to have roommates to lower costs. You also have to manage your money well and live within your means. This may mean living pretty frugally for some people. 

> I guess I'm somewhat afraid of doing all of this - I think I need to take the best foot forward in some cases.

Acknowledge the fear and keep going. Sometimes I think being afraid of something tells us that we should be doing it. If you're afraid, and you do it anyway, you will learn and grow and overcome. You will be in a better place than you would be if you let the fear prevent you from moving forward.

Don't let fear hold you back. Don't let fear be the only reason you don't do something. You wouldn't want to look back on this time in your life and have any major regrets. Live your life. Experience all that it has to offer. Be along for the journey. You never know where it will take you."

I wish I had known how hard it was going to be. My life changed pretty drastically after graduating. After college I moved to a big city and work a pretty demanding job with long hours that takes up almost all of my free time. I enjoy it but looking back college seems so easy in comparison (granted, my major was also generally regarded as an “easy” major).

Having said that, I don’t want to scare you - just because my job is demanding and stressful doesn’t mean yours will be. 

I’m not sure there’s anything else I would want to know. I did several internships, research and networking in college so I felt pretty prepared there. If you haven’t gotten an internship yet or networked, you need to start ASAP. Experience and connections are how you get jobs.

Also a lot of people struggle to find jobs after graduation so don’t be discouraged / too hard on yourself if it takes you weeks / months. It’s a very competitive world out there.

You're 22 - you're just starting your life and getting into ""the real world."" You have so much time to figure it out. So much time to start your career. So much time to make mistakes, fall down, pick yourself back up, and start again. 

Continue applying for internships and full-time jobs. Your internship may not have been the best, but it sounds like it might have been a good learning experience - you learned what you *don't* want to do, which can be just as valuable as learning the opposite. The good news is that you're now closer to learning what you *do* want to do than you were before. 

Keep applying. You will find something. And remember that many people are in a similar situation. Most people don't know what they're doing and are just making it up as they go along. Fake it 'til you make it and keep trying. Don't give up!"
college,fe0wkuu,t3_enj9ny,1578819591.0,"You will probably never be done with applications in your life. 

After internships you'll have to apply for full-time jobs. If you ever want to go back to school, you'll have to apply again then too. And there's all kinds of things life requires other applications for anyway. 

When it comes to internship/job applications I would say you need to strike a balance. You should be putting solid effort into the positions you really want, but you also need to be sending out a lot of applications. You probably will never hear back from most places you apply to. That's just the reality for a lot of people these days, unfortunately. I would personally not recommend spending an hour on three sentences. If you're struggling with something, I would take a break and come back to it later. 

Concerning internships with 4% acceptance rates - are you applying to really competitive, national ones, or ones with big companies? If so, I would continue to apply to those, but also make sure you are applying to plenty of local places and small organizations. They may be more likely to take a chance on you, especially if you haven't had any internship experience before. 

Go to your school's career center and post an anonymous version of your resume to r/resumes. Get some feedback. If you're applying to internships in different areas, consider creating a few copies of your resume that are more tailored to each of those areas. For positions you really want, tailor your resume more thoroughly. Consider adding a cover letter (I say consider because you don't necessarily need one). 

Go to the career fair. Sign up for workshops or mock interview sessions. Make sure you are looking at any job board(s) that are specific to your school, as you'll probably have higher chances of getting those. Make sure you are also looking at a range of job searching websites as well. Get on LinkedIn. Go to networking events. Talk to people - family, friends, professors, advisors, classmates, etc. Who you know absolutely matters when it comes to getting a job."

LifeAfterSchool,fdocjld,t1_fdlki9l,1578602693.0,"I think college is definitely way too expensive these days, and I’m not arguing that, but it’s not 60k just for a piece of paper. It’s 60k for the education, knowledge, skills, ways of thinking, networking opportunities, internships, career prep, overall personal and professional growth (I don’t know about you but I grew a lot in college that I would have not grown otherwise), etc. Yes, you also get the piece of paper, but that piece of paper says you have a degree that is a minimum requirement for a lot of employers these days. And you can get a lot more out of college if you use your time and resources wisely."

AskNYC,famkp4h,t3_e9bmqz,1576206191.0,"Whenever I visit family, the silence is the most jarring. I’m surrounded by noise in the city. When I go home it’s kind of eerie how it’s so... quiet. Still. Spacious. Spread apart. 

In the city I feel like I can go anywhere. When I go to my hometown, it seems like everything is so far away and it’s so much effort to get in my car and drive somewhere."
LucidDreaming,famiven,t3_e9xrgk,1576204931.0,"When I wake up I have the memories of the lucid dream happening (if I remember). In my memories I’m always very aware, present, and experiencing as it happens. In the dream I know I’m able to think and remember things I wanted to do that I thought of while I was awake so it’s very similar to being awake. I just don’t remember any of it happening until I wake up. 

I’m sure I’ve had plenty of lucid dreams I don’t remember having, but I was aware of them while I was in them."

TheLastAirbender,fa8cf1n,t1_fa8bsfq,1575844362.0,"I honestly believe the book does her story justice. I don’t need to see her story in animated form. The medium works well for getting information that you can’t get from a series, such as insight into character’s thoughts, and greater depth overall. Reading is becoming a lost art unfortunately but I really hope you can appreciate reading her story. 

Don’t knock it completely and think you need a series before you even read the book."

If you really want to travel, I would recommend securing a job offer first and pushing your start date back if you can.

When I graduated I gave myself a few weeks before starting work. Others I knew didn’t have start dates until July, August, or September."

You need to find new things in your life that you enjoy, and accept that part of your life is now over. Remember there also may have been many things that weren’t all that great about college and you could be looking through rose-colored glasses."
