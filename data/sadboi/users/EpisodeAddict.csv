TrueOffMyChest,fbz3cvn,t3_ef2tx3,1577233839.0,"I was a gp receptionist and the amount if people who got annoyed when they left the doctors office because they werent given medication for their cold or rash or whatever. I'm like, what you want to be ill ? You want tablets?? I always said the ones who argued with the reception team about appointments arent really as unwell as the others

I've got an unstable mood disorder and I find it terrifying. Why do people want to be branded with something?"

UKPersonalFinance,fa51l0t,t1_fa51bhd,1575810734.0,"Hes working all hours of the day 7 days a week and in the process of looking for a better paid job.

Just advice on how we could manage where could we go or is there an option I havent yet thought of an organisation i havent thought of"
UKPersonalFinance,fa50iem,t1_fa4zuxs,1575810439.0,"Hi. 

We could afford the bill for the vet that's why I paid it (I was working at the time and that was only one of the examples in all the problems we had last year)

I updated my post with the credit file details. Yes we have ccj etc.. 

I have tried to push the mental health team. I had a 20 minute appointment with them in November and I have a 20 minute follow up in February. I'm not getting anywhere with them"
UKPersonalFinance,fa4xwy5,t1_fa4xt1q,1575809576.0,Yes my fiance has a ccj and an iva so we both get rejected.
pregnant,f8etmof,t3_e0j6qz,1574533619.0,You can as long as it was frozen first to ensure the nasties are definitely dead. I did.
pregnant,f7kkntx,t1_f7jms7v,1573815555.0,"Hi

The scan I have booked tomorrow will give me an ultrasound, it is designed for early pregnancy  they can at least confirm how many embryos there are if baby hasn't developed into a foetus yet. Plus they said if the results of the ultrasound are not satisfactory they will offer me the transvaginal scan.  And pictures to take home and sent to my mobile! I know baby wont be very clear but I just need to know it's still there.."
pregnant,f7jdd35,t1_f7jd6n7,1573775251.0,I've booked a private scan for two days time to put my mind at restxx
pregnant,f7jd6n7,t1_f7im114,1573775148.0,I did two line clear blues and a digital clear blue then yesterday I did a first response test. I don't remember the clear blue lines darkness
pregnant,f7hvou9,t1_f7ht8uw,1573748319.0,It's shocking that we have to exaggerate almost to get things done. I love our NHS and I used to work at a hospital but now things are different xx
pregnant,f7hr7kg,t3_dutn0p,1573746032.0,"Hi 

I should be about 8 weeks pregnant this week. 

I did my test four weeks ago. I had three positives with three different streams of urine. I went to the midwife appointment yesterday to organise the booking appointment etc and I was hoping she'd check my Urine but they don't do that anymore they said they would check that at every appointment after once I've been for my booking appointment. I haven't had a period since 17th September but I was hoping someone medical would confirm it. After coming home from my appointment I bought two more tests and did them both last night and this morning they showed negative. I phoned the midwife and she requested I do another test next week if I like but to otherwise wait for my first appointment at the hospital in two weeks time. 

I do not feel pregnant and have had no symptoms - for some that is lucky but for me it is scary. I tried to book a private early scan but they won't see me without a positive test which I don't have. So what would you lady's do in this situation?  

By the way I'm in the uk. 

Yes I could wait but I'm so worried. It took me 3 years of trying to get pregnant , they know I have mental health concerns and I was hoping they would bring me in even if to just ease my worries."

offmychest,f2jn5z2,t3_ddgcwc,1570274927.0,Well done. You're a strong person :)
shortscarystories,ez7uqj0,t3_cxf1ve,1567728642.0,Loved this. Well done

amiugly,estao0v,t1_est9d7u,1562264534.0,But they arent chipped. I've looked and looked again at my picture and all I can see if my polish rubbing off and I simply havent repainted them
amiugly,est1v8c,t1_essv3ga,1562260978.0,I understand that but it was the only place I found where ny question and picture met the requirements. And my post clearly centres around the eczema issue. I wasnt asking for anyone to be brutal. But I suppose that's what I get for expecting people on the internet to be decent.
amiugly,esrw01f,t1_esrvl50,1562238419.0,Also remember people have different tastes so some may give a 5 or 8 or 10. We all ha e different types. I think my fiance is the most handsome man because but others dont think so x
amiugly,esrvl50,t3_c8ymqg,1562238053.0,Hi!  I think you're pretty. Dont listen to the others. Some people must enjoy being mean. Should see the comments I got on my amiugly post.
DreamAnalysis,esrvcg8,t3_c8vbfj,1562237843.0,"I agree with the first commenter. I also think that maybe somehow she is evaluating the time he did first meet her. Like maybe his body language, when he said hello did he sound quite enthusiastic?
 I hope I explained that alright"
amiugly,esruwtp,t1_esqnfj5,1562237482.0,Thanks. I'll ask the doctor about it at my next review:)
amiugly,esruumi,t1_esr338v,1562237433.0,"I probably look ""tired"" because I'm not caking on makeup in this picture or using a filter to hide under eyes because it would defeat the point of me showing the eczema. 
I understand I have asked people their opinion of my eczema and obviously set myself up for a load of cunty comments like this but it is out of order to be honest. 

For your information I am overweight and tired. I'm not working right now and I'm suffering with depression. 

Thank you for your time."
amiugly,esruohk,t1_esr7oxz,1562237277.0,Thank you. That's so kind. I've never been complimented on my eyes before :)
amiugly,esrum3n,t1_esrd780,1562237214.0,"They are clean.. I just havent repainted them for a while... 

It's funny how I asked about my skin and everyone is coming up with other things..."
amiugly,esqij30,t1_esq6l1e,1562203180.0,Hi. Yeah I have heard if people cutting out milk and sugar and it helped a lot. It is something I try to do as I have IBS so I have to be careful what I eat anyway
amiugly,esqif04,t1_esqhlz8,1562203110.0,Hi. I dont think I have. I've had fucibet and hydrocortisone. I also had a course of oral steroids when I was really really bad.
amiugly,espg8ce,t1_espg3gu,1562183867.0,Thank you so much. I got a tear in my eye then! I guess I need to tell my low self esteem to f off too!
amiugly,espfi05,t1_espfdyi,1562183546.0,I did yes. It just hasn't gone since then.
pics,esp7yz3,t3_c8qrwb,1562180275.0,You are amazing:)
Witches,esp7wkw,t3_c8fogv,1562180245.0,That's pretty cool. Well done:)
amiugly,esp7u5g,t1_esp7dz8,1562180215.0,"Well even some strong steroid creams can stop working. I have to moisturise a lot. It is persistent. 

You're the second person to mention my weight I dont why I didnt notice it before. I guess my skin has always been my main concern."
amiugly,esp7hbg,t1_esp7cr2,1562180056.0,My whole life. Most of the time people grow out of it after childhood and it did disappear for a little bit then it came back
amiugly,esp5kqy,t1_esp5fc4,1562179248.0,Yeah. In uk you need to be referred to a dermatologist or go private and the gp doesnt think its severe enough to refer me
Witches,esp55zh,t3_c8kmf3,1562179069.0,Perhaps start with what interests you. For example healing. You can then start looking into it and building up a grimoire. Look up supplies that can assist you with that speciality.
amiugly,esp4oce,t1_esp46yf,1562178864.0,I didnt make my message clear. I kind of didnt think about my weight until you said it. I only worried about my skin. Now I'm thinking that I am fat So now I know that now I can start losing weight.
amiugly,esp4b1w,t1_esp40rb,1562178704.0,Aw thank you. I try to keep it away but even the strongest creams can stop working
amiugly,esp3fbw,t1_esp1utn,1562178333.0,Well I've got a fat stomach so I'd rather not. But they're basically like they are on my face but dotted around. Like my shoulders.
amiugly,esp3buv,t1_esp03iz,1562178291.0,"Yeah that is something people with eczema get a lot. ""Are you contagious""

I have gained weight recently. I'm not working at the moment due to mental health reasons so I've havent had exercise lately. But when you're covered in eczema you dont to be seen out so it's a vicious cycle."
amiugly,esowtus,t3_c8lpg3,1562175438.0,"Wow! You look like my fiance! 
He has also recently lost a lot of weight but he does still have problem with his acne and hes 25. 

 But I think you're cute. I like your hair. :)"
amiugly,esowgxo,t3_c8ox0d,1562175277.0,No. Dont be silly. Your skin is so smooth looking for a start (drink plenty of water and moisturise to keep it looking that perfect for later life)  you're eyes a lovely too. I dont really worry about hair because you can cut it dye it or whatever.
amiugly,esow7xf,t1_esow3la,1562175165.0,Plus! I'm 25 and I look 18 but trust me when you and I are 30 we'll be laughing at the ones who look old
amiugly,esow3la,t3_c8pjkc,1562175114.0,You're cute. Cheeky little smile. But that's biased for me because I look for nice eyes and smile. Now having said that take a clearer picture so we can see your gorgeous eyes better!
DAE,esovc9k,t3_c7stol,1562174783.0,Thanks guys. Thought I was just silly. I see my psychiatrist again in 6 weeks. I'm going to go alone and correct some of the info I gave her last time.
single,esoufvx,t3_c4fv2k,1562174382.0,I know this post was 9 days ago but I'd definitely kiss you!
DAE,eshcacl,t3_c7lelp,1561989173.0,Its not the same but I hate exposing any part of me because I have eczema. I dont care if they think I'm too chubby to wear short shorts but I so care when people see my sore skin because they think im I'll or contagious or something.
DAE,eshc04d,t3_c7nx39,1561988953.0,Dark mode at night does disturb my eyes but I keep it that way all the time just because I prefer the black theme.
DAE,eshby8m,t3_c7l0oi,1561988912.0,Mm. It bothers me because they will forget to change the channel back.
DAE,eshbw0r,t3_c7hv08,1561988861.0,I'm the same. If I receive the wrong order I let them know because our dishes could have been swapped around but I am not going to kick up a fuss if I got chips when I asked for salad side because they're busy and it's not a massive issue for me to eat around it.
DAE,eshbqp0,t3_c76wxr,1561988745.0,Yes! I must look bizarre with the fan on and a blanket but I need the blanket to feel cozy but it's too hot so I have the fan on. And air con is a different kind of cool. It's more refreshing.
DAE,eshbn1x,t3_c2eyhm,1561988666.0,Yeah. I could be asking a silly question so I hide it. I use google so often when I'm curious. Even if it isn't a rude or sexual query I still feel embarrassed for asking something that may seem stupid.
DAE,eshbk8e,t3_c394vn,1561988605.0,Yeah. I dont know why I do it  it could be someone I like but I will still avoid bumping into them. I wonder if it is because it wasnt on my own terms.
mentalhealth,esajs32,t3_c6niou,1561761256.0,Thats fantastic. I'm 25 and keep meaning to do it. So really well done x
