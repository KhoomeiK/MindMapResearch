ICleanedMyRoom,fo082j3,t1_fnzbn19,1587407710.0,That’s the unfortunate truth. Having a pretty kitchen does make it feel extra special when it’s clean though. I hope you can renovate yours and find the motivation to clean.
bipolar,fo07wmi,t1_fnz9mvh,1587407628.0,Right?! And happy cake day!

bipolar,fo00me2,t1_fnz2uk1,1587403996.0,Thank you. My kitchen looked like that for so long before I was able to tackle it. My advice is to start small and just try to believe in yourself.
bipolar,fnzyyzx,t1_fnyuobw,1587403185.0,Aww I really appreciate that! =D

bipolar,fnxz4t1,t1_fnxyw6x,1587349559.0,Thank you. I feel blessed to have such a nice space. Now I’m really hoping I can keep it clean this time!
bipolar,fnxyo8v,t1_fnxuq5j,1587349250.0,It feels so different. It’s well worth it.
bipolar,fnxyf26,t1_fnxaw94,1587349083.0,Thanks. It really is!

bipolar,fnxpq2n,t1_fnxp5bg,1587343728.0,"It WAS a pain in the ass. I started by wiping all the solid stuff I could get with a sponge. Then I used a wire scraper thingy to get the crusty stuff off, and wiped it down with a wet washcloth. Then I used Kenmore Cleaning Cream for Smooth Top Ranges to clean and shine it with a paper towel. That product works super well!"
bipolar,fnxpg3p,t1_fnxp0ke,1587343555.0,"Thank you so much for the support. I was really hesitant to post the before pictures because I’m honestly embarrassed to admit that I live like that most of the time. I have a lot of shame, too. But shame isn’t a helpful emotion for me, so I try hard not to judge myself. The support of this community has been so helpful for that."
bipolar,fnxonfp,t1_fnxo32t,1587343069.0,"Thank you so much. Seeing other people post their progress and projects always helps inspire me so I’m happy to be able to share mine here, too."

bipolar,fnxll8b,t1_fnxkp4z,1587341188.0,It helps that my partner makes a good wage and is able to help us afford this house. I feel very fortunate.
bipolar,fnxlhkr,t1_fnxkw03,1587341125.0,Thanks! It feels good for sure.
bipolar,fnxlewl,t3_g4g2jb,1587341080.0,Thanks a ton :) I love the way my counters shine when they’re sparkly clean!
ICleanedMyRoom,fnxjx7e,t1_fnxji4z,1587340187.0,Thank you! Now let’s hope I can maintain it...
bipolar,fnxik7i,t1_fnxfs11,1587339365.0,"Thanks so much. It took most of last night and half of today but it was so worth it. I’m going to try my best to keep the dishes from piling up, because that’s how things get out of control for me. Good luck in your craft space, I’m sure you will feel amazing if you do it!"
bipolar,fnxi9ep,t1_fnxhxbl,1587339189.0,"Good luck to you, I know how hard it can be. I believe in you!"
bipolar,fnxi847,t1_fnxhxbl,1587339167.0,"For me, the idea of a before and after picture was what initially inspired me to start cleaning. I really wanted to see the comparison. I took several “before” photos before I actually started. Then I broke my kitchen up into sections and worked on a section until it was completely done before moving onto the next section. Also blasting music really helps me."
ICleanedMyRoom,fnxhxtd,t1_fnxgrv1,1587338995.0,Thanks. I was diagnosed with type 1 last May. Just now coming out of the depressive funk.
bipolar,fnxhubd,t1_fnxgvlt,1587338937.0,Wow thanks so much. I feel infinitely better than I did when I woke up this morning. I finally have the motivation to get things done around my house and it feels so good.
bipolar,fnxcic0,t1_fnxc56b,1587335868.0,Thanks :)

bipolar,fnxbyft,t1_fnxawi8,1587335550.0,"Thank you so much. Good job to you, too. It sucks that the simplest things can be the most daunting sometimes."
bipolar,fnxa1bq,t1_fnx9po7,1587334450.0,It really does. I’ve been focusing on my mental blocks around cleaning in my past few therapy sessions and I think it’s really making a difference.
ICleanedMyRoom,fnwlwco,t1_fnwjomy,1587320890.0,We had spaghetti!
ICleanedMyRoom,fnway82,t1_fnwa2j6,1587314896.0,That’s a good idea. I feel bad about the waste but it’s probably worth it.
ICleanedMyRoom,fnw86lp,t1_fnw7t0q,1587313362.0,"Thanks for the support. I have Bipolar Type 1 and I’ve been depressed for several months. I find them disgusting too, which is why I try to at least rinse things off before I let them pile up. It’s hard when I literally feel like I don’t care about anything. It also doesn’t help that I have a lot of dishes so I can go a long time without running out of things. I’ve been thinking about getting rid of some so I have to wash things more often."

ICleanedMyRoom,fnw65ie,t1_fnvjc8e,1587312212.0,That’s the nature of depression unfortunately.
ICleanedMyRoom,fnv4p9k,t1_fnv4ji8,1587280158.0,This is a really great perspective. Thank you so much for sharing. :)
ICleanedMyRoom,fnujkhi,t1_fnujg7k,1587263633.0,Thanks so much. It’s my favorite room in the house when it’s clean.

bipolar,fekxqqg,t1_fekwzy4,1579209784.0,I’m sorry you went through that and had those feelings. It’s so frustrating what we can make up in our own heads. And accepting reality once you’ve convinced yourself of something can be so difficult.
bipolar,feibyuq,t1_feiarq8,1579134937.0,Thanks for listening! I love this band so much. Their music always hits me like that.
bipolar,febj1sx,t3_eo722p,1578959310.0,I’m glad you’re having a good day! Good luck in therapy and on your interview :)

bipolar,fdtczxs,t1_fdtbna7,1578715005.0,Thank you. She is definitely helping. :)
bipolar,fdri2hv,t3_emsa0z,1578684795.0,I’m in the same place right now. I don’t know whether to feel nervous or excited. Almost anything is better than depression though...
bipolar,fdo65po,t1_fdo4dgx,1578599570.0,Thank you! ♥️
loseit,fdhkvth,t1_fdhiya8,1578424806.0,"I feel for you. Going back to my doctor after gaining all the weight back was so difficult for me. I felt so ashamed because she has been so proud of me for losing the weight that I just felt like a complete failure. For me, it helps to remember that I know I can do this because I’ve done it before. Also, I didn’t gain back ALL of the weight (neither did you), so that feels a little better. I plan to just keep coming back to this community for inspiration to keep this hope alive. I hope that you will feel better and more capable too. We can do this!"
bipolar,faikh6n,t3_e9cygg,1576110031.0,This is so peaceful looking. Nice job! I’m glad you felt inspired today.
