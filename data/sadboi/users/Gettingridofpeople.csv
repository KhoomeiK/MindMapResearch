I didn't want to make her choose between me and them so I just found a new crowd to hang out with, but nothing serious.

Few months passed and we were invited to the same party by our mutual friend and there was a moment when me and one of the girls I had the worst beef with almost reconciled. But I just couldn't do it so it was my fault.

Another few months passed, I became very lonely and miserable during this time. When the graduation day came I wasn't avoiding my old friends, we talked, I took some drugs with one of the guys and it was on a good way. That's what I thought, but the truth was that it was too late. We all went our separate ways and from what I know they don't really keep in touch between themselves either.

I realized that it was my fault, I was the glue that hold them together. They wouldn't have even met if it wasn't for me. I screwed everything up for myself and for them too. I regret it, but I can't do anything now.
