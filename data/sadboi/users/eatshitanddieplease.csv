when you feel angry, scream into a pillow and let it out. cry your heart out if you need to, it’s okay to express sadness and anger. 


if you have a lot of things you want to tell him but you never want to speak to him again, write it in a letter but never send it. just really put your feelings in words, and it can give you some clearance on the situation. 


if he has hurt you or treated you badly and you don’t want to forgive him, don’t. forgive yourself for letting it affect you for so long and spending so much negative energy on it. 


you can let go now, and let yourself move on from a bad experience. 


hope it helped, at least a little."
