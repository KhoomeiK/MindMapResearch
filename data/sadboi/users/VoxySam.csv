depressionregimens,f3g4k96,t3_dgxa40,1570907356.0,My psychiatrist didn’t even suggest tapering down. I’ve been off it for two days and I can’t even drive cause I’m so dizzy. I will message her and see if we can taper down. Thank you.

iCheated,eu4g0gv,t3_cegaum,1563452703.0,If you want to talk about anything hit me up I cheated on my husband and was able to work through things. It was hard. But I know what it’s like to feel like the bad guy all the time so if you need to vent I’m here.
iCheated,eu39boy,t3_cegaum,1563408681.0,"Say you decide to stay with your wife, would you tell her you cheated? Would she react with leaving you? I feel like you care for your wife and the family you have together you should definitely try to fix that but you would have to come clean about the cheating and that’s going to make things even worse to work through."

Parenting,eqkto44,t3_byoq1z,1560130885.0,"I hear ya. Some days I’m 100% done and your babies are at prime crazy time. Idk how you feel with antidepressants or anti anxiety meds but since I’ve started my antidepressant I have more of a handle on things, I have more patience. Idk your situation but I know exactly how you feel. Maybe find ways to go about your days differently and don’t worry so much about cleaning the house take your time have fun with your babies. Wake up before them have a cup of coffee or do something you enjoy before the chaos begins. Who cares about the “other stuff” learn to enjoy your time with them and when they go to there dads detox from mom stuff or heck focus the cleaning and other things when there gone."
