I have to take him for a forensic interview Friday. Then court next Monday. Last week, this week, and next week. Has been absolute hell. Between having to take him to the doctor, make sure my house is spotless for CPS to come talk to my son,   dealing with him and his family trying to forcefully take him when CPS said for them to not have any contact with him until after Friday(depending on what they find), going to the court house, and trying to prepare for Halloween on top of taking care of my other 2 kids, I am exhausted mentally and physically. No sign of this stopping and next week is my bday and the week after is my son's birthday."

inlaws,f2rvy7j,t1_f2qk2oe,1570377003.0,"I participated in most yes. But it also didn't give her the right to try to talk my husband into leaving me and our daughter or poisoning My my one year old.  But my point is, it's all in perception  my friend.   When someone comes from the outside (your SO) they see things different than the people on the inside ( you and your family). My husband didn't think there was any thing weird going on with his family until someone from the outside(me) threatened that. Maybe there are things going on that you don't know about that needs to be fixed. It's not fair to blame everything on one party. Does your mom do things that she specifically knows your wife doesn't like?  I'm sure your wife isn't super happy you aren't supportive of her either.  Maybe your wife doesn't tell you everything to spare your relationship with your mom.  My ex MIL was shit too but I got along with her most of the time even though she threatened to kill my son if she had another stillborn (long story) and my husband didn't give two shits how she was to me and that put a lot of issues between me and him. He always saw me as the problem even though I'm very passive.   I think you need to talk to them both and see what is really going on. Just remember she's your mom so you grew up with the way she is, you are used to it, your wife isn't."
