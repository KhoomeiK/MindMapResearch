Don't ask *what* she wants, ask, ""do you want \_\_\_\_?"" or ""I'm getting food from \_\_\_\_, what do you want me to pick up for you?"" Make suggestions, you know? It won't completely stop her from feeling on-the-spot, but it should soften the blow some by not putting all the apparent responsibility on her. It should work the same for general activity, too. Not ""what do you want to do?"" but ""do you want to see \_\_\_\_\_ movie?""

Unfortunately, that's the only specific advice I can give. And, unfortunately, this won't always work. You're not going to be able to prevent the depression. Different people can be alone different amounts and still be safe and comparatively healthy. Don't take anything personally if you can. Be ready to help her if and when she does ask for something specific. Don't sacrifice your own health in the process."
bipolar,finuz72,t1_finuqdb,1582570702.0,"Heh, no worries. One thought that did occur to me that didn't when I was first typing is that I should clarify that ""being on disability"" isn't the only determining factor on if someone is ""disabled"" so far as how I see things for myself; too many people DO have conditions bad enough that they *should* be granted legal recognition and support of their condition, but are denied and don't have the resources to appeal however many times necessary."
bipolar,fintiqn,t3_f8vnst,1582569861.0,"I see it as ""a disability"" and ""disabling"" but I don't identify as ""disabled"" as such. I still need accommodations, so technically I guess I am, but *for me* unless (god forbid) I end up on actual, legal medical disability I don't say I'm disabled. The same goes for my migraines as for my bipolar. They're disabling, and I request exceptions to accommodate and work through/around them, but I'm not disabled *yet* and with any luck I won't have to ever *fully* identify that way.

As for those resources at your job? That's amazing. So many companies, even those who are supportive otherwise, don't have anything official that's similar. Even without immediately needing it, if I had a resource like that I'd be extremely grateful just in case something changed in the future and I can't get by without the help."

It's very similar to u/jrp123nova's description, though. And they're right saying that mixed is often the worst; with only depression or only hypo/mania, you can potentially see and recognize where you are on your own personal mood scale. Knowing that can be a tiny bit comforting, even though it's not comforting enough. When mixed, though?

Anything I've ever tried has been that whole ""three to six week"" to full effectiveness going on. And until that point? I've always felt worse in the short term. Give whatever your doc recommends a decent chance (up to two months, maybe, if the side effects can be tolerated) and if they don't already know, go ahead and tell them about smoking. I never have, but I can't see how it wouldn't affect how your medicines do or don't work.

edit: ""never have smoked"" not ""never told my doc."" I just don't like the smell, then later there was no reason to try because it'd interact with *other* medicines I had."

When I click that there are toggles to turn wifi off and on, mobile network with a + by it, then airplane mode, hot spot and tethering, etc. On my phone I go straight to hot spot and tethering, and all three options I use are there, wifi hotspot, usb tethering, and bluetooth tethering.

Now then, what I do have trouble with sometimes is getting the phone recognized as connected to the laptop in the first place. that whole ""click your picture to login"" almost never lights up as an option, saying to make sure bluetooth is on and in range.... even though my phone's six inches away and the bt connection is confirmed.

If you do get put on the shot, your doctor might require you to come in to get it each time, BUT, you can also get it from your own pharmacy with or without a pre-filled syringe. I got my doc to how to do draw it up myself until my pharmacy started carrying the pre-filled ones. It's actually super easy, so long as you can hit the muscle in your upper/outer thigh.

bipolar,fi6rvat,t3_f6jowb,1582205774.0,"I lost my last job (apartment complex assistant manager) because of my bipolar (technically 1, though I *usually* only get hypomanic; gotta love that whole ""only one full manic episode ever and you're considered bp1 forever""), in spite of accommodations. (I requested one thing, they ""compromised"" with an alternate accommodation, citing ""concern for my health"" due to the nature of my request. I couldn't keep up with the compromise.)

Unless you have an EXTREMELY patient and understanding company, do NOT disclose. Your company doesn't have any legal right to know unless you are requesting a legal accommodation. Even if you do have a company that will work with you without official requests I still wouldn't disclose, because there are still subconscious biases.

In my current job (billing department for a construction subcontractor) I have that very understanding boss. She might know on her own what my situation is (if my browser history has been given to her for her to see all my bipolar-related google searches and my visits here), but at the very least she knows there's *something* because she's very attentive mostly professionally, but also a bit personally, about how I'm doing and how I'm handling things. She's *specifically said*, just yesterday as well as other times, that she'll do everything to help *but I have to tell her what I need* for her to do so. She's all but used the word accommodation. This has been amazing, but other than cutting my workload in half (not an option for me) there's really nothing that can be requested.

My current job, the billing department, is pretty much perfect for me outside of when I'm having noticeable swings... like the last almost two weeks. I'm coping, though, and with any luck this will either pass soon or it will shift into a productive phase. (Productive phases, I get actual twice as much done in a day. Standard swing phases, depressed or hypo/manic, I only get half as much as a non-swing day.)

*Tl;dr: Don't give them an excuse to react even if it's subconscious, find your niche (it sounds like you have that for the 90% of the time you mentioned), and find your coping mechanism for the other 10%.*"
