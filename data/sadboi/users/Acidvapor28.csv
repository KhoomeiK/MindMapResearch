BeautyGuruChatter,fmzsrhx,t1_fmyy7rt,1586528782.0,Thanks for the recommendation! I would recommend Kackie Review Beauty if you are interested. She uses clean and conventional products both :) I think Samantha Ravindal does too but im not entirely sure.
cleanbeauty,fmx0j50,t3_fxcizn,1586456298.0,Its ridiculous I was trying to speak to a fellow colleague and some random person shows up acting like I was attacking. Not my fault the rando has poor reading comprehension and can't see I'm speaking to a fellow in the community of science. It's ridiculous how crazy people get because they misread something or assume an emotion in a post.
cleanbeauty,fmuqiqq,t1_fmtxlji,1586396712.0,Thanks for responding. It's frustrating that we get lumped in with militants just because we need something different for cosmetic formulations. I have hypersensitive skin and need products that are non irritating.
mentalhealth,fmthygc,t3_fx2qdr,1586373034.0,"I honestly dont know what it truly is. It could be my health issues, my need to go to the gym, or stressing about my grades as I have had to convert to online university courses recently. I feel very down though. Sometimes like crying. I have a wonderful husband and we spend time together, but something keeps puling at the seams on me...I've felt lonley about a few things lately. It's nothing my spouse can help with. Its not an interest of his. I've also worried about finances. I'm only working part time right now while I pursue my education. I'm close to graduating, but now I've gotta take time off just to catch back up on bills."
BeautyGuruChatter,fmtdp9s,t1_fmsnb8b,1586370988.0,"1.) First of all, leading with being part of the grammar police is not going to win your argument. You completely ignore the fact that I was speaking to the previous individual as a fellow colleague. I gave 2 pieces of relevant background information. This is not bragging or ""touting accolades"" as you like to call it. If I wanted to tout my accolades I'd list a whole bunch of things and thats not the point nor intention so why do that? I was not in a debate with this individual. I simply replied to her comment. I had no negative feelings towards her or her views. The information I further provided was to discuss the comment about ingredients and that is all relative as everyone has their own definition of what is bad. This is a point I stated clearly in my original post. 

3. Clean makeup is made up of chemicals, absolutely..look finally something we agree on. 

4. I was not condescending nor rude. A long paragraph does not denote either of those things. Nor did I list ""all"" of my achievements. For someone who touts herself as a life and debate coach I would expect better reading comprehension from you and understanding. However, what you provide is judgement, lack of understanding and are yourself unkind in your delivery. If the individual I spoke to has a problem with what I said or how I said it she can address me directly. 

5. I was nice in my original post and to the individual I spoke to again you said ""I went off"" you are trying to pull emotion out of a comment simply meant to speak to someone as a colleague, and one cannot truly know other individual's emotions from a comment nor a text. This is what leads to discourse such as what you and I are having here. You tell me to chill, but you yourself are having a field day over a response that you are looking for tits on an ant over. If you are unwilling to see this error then there is no point in us continuing speaking. So far all I have had here is people being nasty over a post meant to engage open minded people. You are again showing me that here is not the place for open minded people. Here is where you join a clique and I'm not interested in going along with the crowd.."
BeautyGuruChatter,fmqurxd,t1_fmqn0uo,1586307503.0,"Seriously? How is it bragging to give my background to an individual who says she is a scientist? Its simply to inform her that im not some idiot who just listens to what every beauty guru tells me and I have the knowledge to research ingredients. Its not my fault you could not understand that. For some reason instead of seeing that i simply presented information relative to a fellow colleague, you decide to take my comment as bragging? Thats a serious reach and if that is what I can expect from this forum then its not the place for me. I was looking for open minded people. I found a couple, but the others have been judgemental, narrow minded and quick to dig for possible negative connotations in any comment. I seriously suggest you re-evaluate the way you comprehend statements or relative information people give if you are so quick to pull out something so negative."
Veterans,fmp7oc4,t3_fw9czc,1586275965.0,"No one told me I would have to police the shit out of the VA...thankfully I was a Navy Doc and Im able to communicate on level with employees there so I can get what I need, but I think about vets who dont have my background and i become sad thinking of how frustrated they have been and dead ends they may have hit. Makes me want to really use my knowledge to help people navigate the VA. Im relentless so I never took no for answer. I never said no i cant help you to my patients and ill be damned before I allow someone to do that to me."
Veterans,fmp4soa,t1_fmp1cmm,1586274438.0,"Hello fellow vet, you can apply for VA benefits straight out of the Service. I am not a retiree and i use the VA for my healthcare. I pay a small amount for medications but it is totally worth it."
BeautyGuruChatter,fmowdo0,t1_fmopfva,1586269788.0,I agree i stopped watching her as well. I don't like people who dont disclose sponsorships or people who claim a product is going to cure an ailment they have that language is dangerous and misleading.
BeautyGuruChatter,fmo8zpu,t1_fmo8vgx,1586249940.0,Thank you
BeautyGuruChatter,fmnlva3,t1_fmmjmcd,1586229118.0,Honestly that is just sad if people literally won't visit this post just because of those two words. I know those terms are being picked up by companies as a marketing tactic and it sucks. I just wanted to talk to people who might be open minded about the subject and perhaps watch some of these youtubers. No one in my family nor friends circle are interested in makeup in the fashion I am so it gets a bit lonley not having someone to communicate with about it...surely someone could understand that?
BeautyGuruChatter,fmnllgt,t1_fmmohgg,1586228924.0,Thank you for your recommendation.
BeautyGuruChatter,fmnljwl,t1_fmn8f1b,1586228895.0,"Im not looking for a holy grail channel. I think you missed entirely what I was after...its incredibly frustrating tbh. I have a background in medicine, I treated patients in the US Navy for 8 years. I am also a senior biology major and I am able to read peer-review studies and understand them. I disagree that their is not a universal bad ingredient. I found one that is bad by doing my due diligence. However, it is up for people to make up their own minds on that and i am not here to change anyone's mind nor did my og post elude to that. Bgs are not scientists and no one I watch presents him or herself as an expert or know it all on ingredients. Also its not that companies are releasing dangerous products its that mostly the ingredients they use are for performance and for being cost effective, however ""some"" of these ingredients can be harmful on their own if its repeated in all the formulations of someone's personal products. An example would be say parabens being in makeup, then lotion, shampoo, body wash, etc etc...then exposure is increased. (This is literally just an example if you use parabens thats fine i dont have a problem and frankly I shouldn't care nor should anyone else. ) Sometimes it's not that the product has a harmful ingredient its that it causes a hypersensitive reaction in someone. For example fragrance exposure causing headaches or even contact dermatitis from a product applied and left on the skin. THIS was my primary point here. Im a sensitive lady. I cannot wear certain preparations of what you would find in say Sephora or Ulta. So i looked for an alternative and i found one and it was in the ""clean"" beauty  world. Do i still use conventional products? Absolutely! I think every person has a right to use what they want without prejudice. I literally came here hoping to find someone who maybe watches a so called ""clean"" youtuber and discuss said youtubers. I was hoping to find open minded individuals willing to communicate. Perhaps there are other people like me who cannot use any eyeshadow from conventional beauty....i seriously can't be the only one."
BeautyGuruChatter,fmm1wfv,t3_fw0kkx,1586197256.0,"I have used the Terra Mae that came in a Petit Vour box. I feel a little iffy on it, I need to test it more. It has a texture and appearance similar to concealer. Some ""clean youtuber's "" rave about it...but we will see"
