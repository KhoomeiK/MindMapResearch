The mindset of entitlement is still there, saying to men that just as they can harass a female schoolmate in childhood to show they ""like"" her by throwing gum on her or pulling her hair, they can disturb the lives of women in adulthood to make it clear that we were never seen as equals.  To these men, our livelihoods must always take a backseat due to their inherent ""superiority"".
