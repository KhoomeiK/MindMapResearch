I saw this repost on Instagram today about how ‘the first hug out of isolation is gonna hit different’ and how that person is excited to hug their friends and family... I was happy for them.

But I knew I wouldn’t have something like that to look forward to."

I know I can make much more of an effort and I could help our relationship and make more conscious decisions to better the entire situation. But I can’t help but be cold like they were when they show signs of affection like I did when I was young."

I did hear about how popular the site became after 50 shades movies came out though haha. Super unfortunate. I think you should give it another shot though, you might find the one :) or at least a fun f buddy to keep you company."
ForeverAloneDating,fhtaf1m,t1_fht9ztn,1581872436.0,"Hahaha man idk maybe you need to find another option or keep trying fet. I’m certainly not like that on there, not sure if it’s because of age or what. I’m genuinely sorry that that was your experience on there though. I wish you good luck!"

I can be pretty self destructive gal a lot of the time though and end up isolating myself because I think others deserve better etc 

Sending lots of love to you x"
lonely,fh7t2q2,t1_fh7h3v6,1581343962.0,I wouldn’t go as far as to call them toxic. I think they were just trying to relate and be able to talk about similar issues they’re both dealing with. I think he’s just having a conversation..
AskReddit,fgwje10,t3_ezi5ce,1581161865.0,"Maybe picturing your ‘higher self’ and dressing the way that way? 

Like what’s your ideal version of yourself? Groomed? Hair cut, investing in skincare?
Dressed differently? Better quality or more shoes for variety? Maybe less band tees? 

I hope you’ve figured it out :)"

relationships,fdjpn4h,t3_ell68c,1578482455.0,"I saw this on a tweet once:

‘Pretty much every time I hear a dude say a woman “doesn’t have a sense of humour” or “can’t take a joke” I assume it meant he harassed her and she didn’t laugh. I’ve never been wrong about it’. 

Changed my life because I can now stand up for myself and say no to shitty people like this who tell me I can’t take a joke etc because they were just being a jerk. 

I’m really sorry this happened. I, along with other people here, would start to plan this break up or getting out ASAP. I think you deserve someone who is kind, can communicate and can understand their mistakes and apologise at least. Or better yet, not treat you badly in the first place.

I really wish the best for you and whatever decision you make 💕"
Anger,fdjonxq,t1_fdjlqmw,1578481138.0,"Oh no :( I didn’t realise. 
I’ve had the same with missing appointments, I’m pretty self destructive I guess and get low and miss many appointments that they tend to give up on me because they see I’m not helping myself. That sounds different to your situation though. I’m really sorry you’ve had a tough time with these therapists. It’s hard to believe they would be like that when they’re supposed to help you but they can be such assholes :( Yeah I would have thought cbt therapy would be a good option too. 

Okay I so I know you said you’d sworn off therapists but how about therapy groups? Rather than one on one? An anger management group perhaps? 
I only suggest this because I did something similar for anxiety once a week for 8 weeks and it worked wonders plus I met some cool people. This is my current plan to find an anger management group once I’m back home from being overseas.

Other than that, please share if you’ve found anything successful through books, YouTube, blogs etc! I’ll do the same if I find anything, I’ve only really just started looking for help with my anger through this sub. I hope you’re finding some tips and tricks through others and feeling better."
Anger,fdf5euv,t3_ekxyvp,1578353713.0,"I get like this too.. people saying it’s ‘banter’ but it just feels like they’re digging at me :c and I get sad and angry all at once.

I hope this isn’t like an obvious question, I’m not sure what you have tried so far. Have you tried therapy? I did a bit for my anger and my counsellor said something wanting change so in this instance being wanting them to stop bullying you or saying silly things to you that could be taken the wrong way. But it’s hard to control what other people say, aye.

I’m a bit the same. I can’t remember what my counsellor suggested to do but just the fact that I could learn why things happened based on my past. I’m sorry if this doesn’t help."

Anger,fcx8svf,t3_eirwme,1578055725.0,"When I read this post, I honestly thought it was my own. 

I’m (25F) going through the same thing and I just joined this subreddit today to look for similar answers. 

I know therapy will help. Although I feel a lot of the time it’s more about venting and not getting down to actual issues? At least I’ve had that with my therapist last year, I will be changing to someone else.

I know that one of the reasons people get angry is because they want change. Could it be because you’re angry you don’t have time to relax / do the things you’d usually like to do for fun or down time? I think this is my problem.

I also feel shame in this sudden change. What the hell happened I say to myself constantly :( I hope you find some answers, I hope I do too. I’m sorry if this isn’t very helpful for you haha 

Please pat yourself on the back for reaching out and wanting change! Thank you for posting this too because I know it will help me and others."
socialskills,fcblabx,t3_egyed1,1577588183.0,"I personally took people out of the usual settings. Like if you’re joking around a lot online, meet up and go somewhere different. If you’re joking around a lot at school, change of scenery would do a lot. I think this helps decide if it should even be taken to another level. Because you might find that it’s better off as friends or it may pull you both closer depending on the setting"

ptsd,fbzywat,t3_efbgfq,1577269309.0,"I’m so sorry you were brushed off and not given the response that would have been much more helpful :( 

I think people might have been shocked or unsure what to say and might come off a bit apathetic for this. Hopefully they show that they care in a way that shows later on in the day or next few days. If they don’t, it’s okay. You will find those hugs elsewhere and it’ll be okay. 

& It’s okay to be sad right now, that would have been very difficult. 

Sending lots of hugs ❤️"
Wellington,eua89kt,t3_cfden8,1563605330.0,I used to live a few doors down until a few months ago and always heard a buzzing sound and thought it was a constant cycle of laundry or some machine but would have never thought of vending machines. Thank you for clearing up my curiosity!
