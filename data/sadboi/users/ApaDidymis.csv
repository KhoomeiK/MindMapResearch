depression,f07il7p,t1_f07dx1a,1568462661.0,"Nah dont think its pretty fair to say its dangerous there no? Sure there are some countries that are facing war and persistent political tensions, but most of the arab countries are much like any other countries. The north africas like Egypt n Morocco is pretty safe and rich in culture for example. Jordan, UAE... i know lots of my seniors in sch studying there and theyre fine.

Anyway if u wanna go to arab countries to learn arabic id like to remind u that almost all of the people living there use their different dialects based on the country they are in. And the words and sentence structures in their dialects when compared to Fushah Arabic (classic), or MSA maybe... i forgot, ranges from ""barely recognisable"" to ""this is unheard of"". Best way to learn classic arabic is from online lessons and books prbbly."

Anyone feels the same way?"

depression,ez8iqw7,t1_ez8hfix,1567744729.0,"My dad hardly shows any love for me. Not really sure he cares or not. Whenever Im facing a problem (other than depression, like school) he would just turn me down says that i should be responsible and deal with it myself. Id be like wtv.

Also, i dont open up to people cos from past experiences they'll just pretend to care while i'm opening up to them, and after i finished talking they'll get up and run, glad to be away from my shits. Then they make sure to never question abt my problems next time we meet.

Thanx anw for staying to read part of these shits."

I came from a family and only my father is working earning a humble keep to support 5 other siblings who needs money for their tertiary studies. I have yet to open up as I'm scared the money would be wasted on me who has no direction in life,  when it could be used for my other siblings who needs it more than me."

Its a solution for the time being."
