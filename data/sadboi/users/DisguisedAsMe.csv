Most people in the hospital know that when an ED gets really bad that it is a mental illness. So, in the hospital they're just trying to stabilize you so you won't die/pass out all the time and you will get more guidance/counseling in the outpatient program that specializes in eating disorders. Now, I don't think that is necessary the right thing to do at all, and I am so sorry for your experience there :( for many people they are very generalized in their practice so their expertise is more for your physical health than your mental health. And for more acute concerns than any long term fixing. Again, I'm sorry as it is super crappy.

Also, it is important to note how this study is pretty old. Way before any #MeToo movement. There is still a lot of stigma surround rape and incest, but definitely more several decades ago."

Libertarian,fdns7xg,t1_fdnnbbf,1578591779.0,"The qualitative study is only of a measly 38 women at 4 locations so we can safely omit this as having too small a sample size.

The quantitative aspect is extremely long (eight pages) and no doubt time consuming. Also, only 58% of patients approached participated. I think that incest and rape would discourage women who went through trauma from wanting to participate in an 8 page questionnaire reliving the experience so it could be biased. Also, only 8 in 10 women who agreed to participate even answered that question. Poorly designed study.
