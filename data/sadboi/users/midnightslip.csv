askportland,fpgu43e,t1_fpgisrw,1588609545.0,"This is the worst feeling. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this!! I had this at the beginning of the pandemic, before our office closed down. 

The only things that got me through it were taking extra steps to protect myself (no public transport, using paper towels to touch things in the office kitchen/doorknobs, extra hand washing) and a hefty dose of delusion. 

I say delusion. Honestly I just had to tell myself it's a completely normal day except I'm taking some extra steps. I also stayed far away from any negative media. Literally no news, just upbeat media. Funny podcasts, new music albums, old music albums but always positive/upbeat. 

It helped me get TO work. Once I was at work and working I did feel better and that things felt ""normal."" Again, no news whatsoever. No following numbers. And NO Trump news chaos."

It's totally fine because everyone has their anti-social moments but I definitely saw him as a real person that day and not the 100% funny man from the show.

I only had one really positive/healthy and memorable sexual partner, and that was damn near 12 years ago. I comfort myself knowing it's possible and knowing I HAVE experienced it before so I CAN experience it again.

I am in therapy. I am nervous about being alone but I know I can do it. Also I refuse to compromise with my body again. It really crept up on me in that last relationship but that is over and I don't have to be that way ever again.

I'm taking it super slow."

What you are talking about is a menstrual disc. Flex and Nixit are a couple brand names of menstrual discs. The disc is soft and flexible and is basically slid into the vagina and held in place behind the pubic bone. There is no suction to the walls of the vagina. 

You have sex with a menstrual disc by basically layering the activities in your vag. The disc is pressed against the roof of the vagina and the penis slides under."
