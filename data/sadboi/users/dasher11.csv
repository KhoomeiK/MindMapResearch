Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fqrdnx9,t1_fqph4rh,1589582320.0,"I'm the *last* person who would ever defend a cop (check my history to confirm), but from the way the traffic is stopped, I'm guessing people had called because this animal was behaving strangely/aggressively, and the cop was sent specifically *to* shoot it.  That's what they do with any wild animal reported to be acting strangely/aggressively. 

When I was a kid, a raccoon outside our house started acting bizarrely, and my dad had to call animal control for suspected rabies.  All they did was send out a cop to shoot it to death in our driveway.  It's one of the clearest memories of my childhood.  

What I *won't* defend is how this piece of shit coward let the animal suffer.  I specifically remember the cop who shot the raccoon for us standing point blank over it and firing into its head twice."
