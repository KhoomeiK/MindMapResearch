BipolarReddit,fmrazxj,t1_fmra2ga,1586318202.0,No problem. I hope it helps somewhat. A good resource for where to start would be your county’s probate court web page. The process varies from state to state and county to county somewhat. You could also call the court and speak to a clerk for more exact information on how to get the ball rolling. Hope everything works out!
BipolarReddit,fmr9k7f,t1_fmr8cpj,1586317152.0,"Guardianship is considered a last resort option for someone and it has to be done through the court. It’s not something you can just submit to the clerk at the courthouse and get filed and stamped. A judge has to deem you incapacitated and unable to care for yourself and they also have to determine if your parents are the best fit for being your guardian. Petitioning for guardianship is how your parents would start the process of obtaining guardianship over you by getting a court date set to go before a judge who would then either grant the petition and make them guardians or not. There likely has to be some reasoning as to why a power of attorney isn’t sufficient in letting your parents make medical decisions. Having a guardian is much more encompassing. Think of it as sort of becoming a minor again. Most cases I’ve dealt with a psych evaluation is ordered and done by a court appointed psychologist to make sure you’re really not fit to care for yourself. They’ll take into consideration what your psychologist and psychiatrist have said and documented, but they still might order one. Most probate courts don’t like to take away people’s rights if they don’t have to. Having a conservator is when they make/take care of financial decisions in your best interest. Guardianship and conservatorship often go hand in hand."

BipolarReddit,fmr5m32,t3_fwx1yz,1586314426.0,"Guardianship is different from a POA in that with a POA you choose who you want to act for you. With a guardian in place, you have to have the guardian appointed by a probate court judge who acts in the interest of the potential ward. In order to have a guardian over you, your parents would have to petition to the probate court in your jurisdiction that they should be co-guardians of you and they’ll have to give reasoning why. You’ll likely have to go through a court ordered psych evaluation as well. Having your parents appointed guardianship gives them full power of all your medical decisions as long as they’re acting in your best interest. Are you interested in having your parents serve as co-conservators over you as well?"
BipolarReddit,flznklp,t3_fs2959,1585628182.0,"Similar to what you said. My manic episodes tend to be much more destructive and are definitely harder to repair the damage left in the wake of them than my depressive episodes. I’ve been rapid cycling for almost a year with two depressive episodes and three manic episodes and currently back in a depressive episode. All with psychosis. With the depression I can mostly deal since I also just sleep like 17-19 hours a day until I become psychotic then it’s a problem. It’s really hard to look back and see how well I was doing for five years prior to the start of these episodes last year. I lived on my own, had a healthy relationship, a good career, and now it’s all gone. And it’s scary because it all happened when I was still taking medication like I should and going to therapy - it’s like everything just stopped working. I think that’s the hardest part for me. Forgetting how much damage this disorder can wreak on not just my life but others and how debilitating it can be. I hate how I act when I’m manic. I never get the “good” mania where I feel euphoric and joyful. I get incredibly irritable, have fits of rage, self-destruct, etc. Feels like a total loss of control."

I had to go on levothyroxine for a while to even out my thyroid. I'm lucky because after I stopped lithium my thyroid returned to normal and has been since I stopped taking lithium. I know lithium is a miracle drug for some people, but it screwed up my life for a good few years from the side-effects. Gained a ton of weight, acne, thyroid issues, tremors, acted like a zombie, etc. This was just my personal experience.

A lot better than auto law or other litigation. Corporate law or in-house at hospitals are also good paying fields and tend to have great benefits, though they typically require a bachelor’s which I don’t have yet. Large universities can also be great but usually require a bit of experience and a bachelor’s. The hardest part is getting by the first couple of years but then your pay goes up considerably. I personally enjoy probate and estate work, and once you know what you’re doing with estates it’s a breeze for the most part. I was stable on meds for most of my employment until this year, so I didn’t have a problem with the work although there were definitely times my clients would test me and it would throw my mood around a bit. I agree about criminal law, doesn’t sound fun and I’ve dealt with my fair share of difficult and legally insane people in GA/CA and am done with it. I just want to deal with older people with assets at this point. The only criminal law I’d consider is white collar but those jobs are difficult to come by and I don’t know much about criminal law anyway. Good luck and don’t let attorneys and clients get to you too much!

I don’t feel like it’s my duty to educate myself on every malady known to man so I can understand everyone’s struggles. 

As long as I’m getting the treatment I need then I don’t really care if some stranger understands what my symptoms are like for me. I wouldn’t want to share my diagnosis with them anyway."
BipolarReddit,eu3d8zd,t3_cel7gk,1563411603.0,"My therapist told me recently I minimize and need to start talking about my symptoms more. I have trouble verbalizing more embarrassing or bizarre behavior. I think some of it’s related to my upbringing and not necessarily related to bipolar disorder. 

Edit: I have one friend I’ve known for about 15 years that knows. Aside from that just my mom and sister know (and of course my therapist and psychiatrist). Basically people I’ve known long enough to notice and I feel I owe an explanation to to some degree. My sister is a psych nurse practitioner, so she’s been a good support (most the time)."

BipolarReddit,etked03,t3_cbz16h,1562895813.0,I take temazepam and klonopin. Normally I just take my klonopin but I haven’t been sleeping at all so I had temazepam added again.

BipolarReddit,esvhxtu,t1_esvghtw,1562299310.0,"No because I get dysphoric episodes and usually I physically start looking shitty from not sleeping or eating, so I don’t look or seem to good to most people I assume. When my mood elevates it’s almost never euphoric and when it is it’s euphoric for a short time before becoming dysphoric and I start acting not like myself at all. My encounters with random people aren’t usually the random people you’d want to hang around so it probably looks bad from an omniscient view.

I’ve been fired from jobs while manic (most recently like 2 months ago), so I don’t appear well or better to people like that when my mood elevates. It never turns out well for me. I think my presentation skills are good but they suck. Doesn’t matter if I dress well or try to look decent or normal. My affect supersedes my presentation."
BipolarReddit,esvgdaq,t3_c9b77d,1562298614.0,Nope. That’s when people close to me realized something was wrong because my behavior was/is bizarre when I’m hypomanic or manic and my elevated mood tends to be dysphoric so it’s not like I’m fun to be around.
BipolarReddit,esurqgj,t3_c99hel,1562288023.0,"Do you think your mom’s passing might bring you a sense of relief?

I know words don’t really mean much when all you can think of is every negative thing about yourself and feeling like suicide is the optimal solution, but I really am sorry you’re feeling so bad and I hope those feelings get a little less intense and you choose to stick around."
