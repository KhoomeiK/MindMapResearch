It’s hard, but try working on your mental health while moving more and eating healthier/cleaner. If you set the goal to lose weight instead of focusing on being healthier overall, you’ll potentially trap yourself into OCD-esque behaviors with it, which is also unhealthy. A lot of people deal with suicidal thoughts from trauma or depression and it rarely has to do with the people they’re with. If he threatened suicide because of you, he’s a gaslighting asshole that’s emotionally manipulating you, which you do not need. Find support groups online or reach out to any friends you have that’ll help you during this time.

Edit: no tips for fixing budget from me as it’d be the blind leading the blind, aside from focus some energy on finding a job that fulfills you and pays higher.

Not to mention, unless an agent is a good agent, they won't let their actors know about parts that they should audition for. I guess we should also have real murderers cast for true crime based television or movies now, too.

Edit: just because someone represents a part in their real life doesn't mean they know how to act, either."

insaneparents,foi9d2j,t3_g7e329,1587781467.0,"Depending on your age, either hit up CPS or press charges. Physical abuse and then further punishment thinly veiled as a compromise/apology is emotional abuse as well."
insaneparents,fohku62,t1_foh0cey,1587767637.0,"Those who actually believe conspiracy theories do not realize they're crazy and won't often seek help. Source: my father believes he has direct contact with extra terrestrials and he'll be our new messiah once they take over the world in the next year, and doesn't believe there is a pandemic until ""bodies are piling in the streets"" because it's actually a ""Democratic ploy to remove Trump."" I've nicely told him in the past I think he should seek therapy, but after being verbally assaulted by him (among other forms of abuse) when I cite facts with sources that debunk his theories, I've resorted to saying similar things to him if/when he reaches out to me."

fatlogic,fod5ywj,t3_g6dmkr,1587680461.0,"Yikes. This must've been the same thought process Australia had when they once banned porn featuring women that had less than a C cup as it ""promoted pedophilia."" Right."

fatlogic,fo8ol24,t1_fo8ilot,1587600671.0,"You hit the nail on the head. I cringe when I see/hear “everyone is beautiful.” I’ve accepted and embraced that I’m not conventionally attractive, then decided to change what I can about myself through fitness. I’m “ugly,” but at least I’m no longer obese and ugly."
fatlogic,fo8odco,t1_fo8n5bp,1587600548.0,"I don’t disagree with you and I’m sure the intent was well meaning, but the comments on this post leaned toward fat positivity/HAES. It’s just an opinion of mine as well, but I don’t think we should say every body is beautiful since it’s subjective. I think it can lead to other esteem issues. From personal experience, hearing “every body is beautiful,” but then never feeling “beautiful” myself led me into a mental trap down the road of not being able to accept myself regardless of weight. Once I acknowledged that beauty is subjective and it’s okay to not feel beautiful due to things I can’t change, but taking control over what I can such as my health and fitness, I was able to overcome it. I also think this statement can be dangerous for those wanting validation over the fact that they’re not eating well or taking care of their bodies during a pandemic."

ugly,fny4gbo,t3_g4erad,1587353171.0,"I relate a lot, you're not alone. I developed PCOS and mild hirsutism as an adolescent and do take medication to balance out my hormones on top of birth control. I've been mistaken for a guy many times, included by medical professionals (before they had my chart), whether I have long hair or not. I've been in relationships, but have never actually been approached by men or women and have initiated everything I've experienced. It's something I've finally accepted and I'd prefer to be left alone because I don't actually enjoy attention, negative or positive. Glad to be in a position of where I'm generally invisible now."

penpals,fnwq9wo,t3_g43g8g,1587323328.0,"I love the idea of this! Not sure where it originated, but I did have a copy of The Artist's Way that recommended morning pages as a daily creativity and stream of consciousness exercise as a way to clear one's mind. I did this for around 6 months straight a couple years ago and it tapered off sporadically as my work schedule changed, but it's something I've been trying to get back into! I'd enjoy participating if interested."
