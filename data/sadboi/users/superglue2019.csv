SuicideWatch,evbrfzo,t1_etxgf98,1564390658.0,Thank you for your advice and concern I appreciate it. I guess it is something I must endure on my own until I can’t anymore. But I appreciate your attention kind stranger. I really do. Thank you.
SuicideWatch,etwvny6,t1_etlxujj,1563285274.0,"Thank you I appreciate your suggestions. I tried to talk to a friend on this by like casually mentioning it a few days ago but I don’t think they’re taking me seriously. And I don’t want to keep bringing this up because I don’t want be seen as attention seeking or make them feel like they’re forced to talk to me because of my suicidal thoughts. 

I’m not depressed. I have a sane mind. I am just so afraid of the consequences of my action. I can’t stand the guilt. I know I should pay for what I did (it is not lawfully illegal) but I just don’t want to ever have to face it especially the disappointment and betrayal I might cause to some. 

I’m not trying to seek attention and I hate attention seekers but I’m really at a dead end here. There is no where else. 

I don’t even like the way I’m sounding right now."
SuicideWatch,etlwln5,t1_etlivso,1562946941.0,"Sigh but it’s not them that I’m running away from. I want to run away from myself. I feel so filthy. Like I’m deceiving everyone. 

Thank you so spending time to chat. I don’t have anyone that I can talk to about this. The only other person I can talk to is somewhat unstable and they tend to trigger my suicidal thoughts. But they are the one who know the actual situation. 

I just really wish I can be gone. Everyone would really be happier if I did not exist. Man. The thing is I used to be so balanced. Was doing real good with all the positivity. I was a happy person. Real happy. Had everything going. But then I made a mistake. And now it’s haunting me. I used to think suicide is not the way that life is precious and all that. But it’s really different when you’re in the situation. It’s so different. I can see how those who have committed suicide thought that that was the only way. I can relate. It’s scary that I c an relate. I wish I can turn back time and I would not have made that mistake. It’s ruining my life and my soul and I just want out of this person."
SuicideWatch,etlipaw,t1_etl979n,1562937528.0,"No sadly I don’t. I can’t take months off from work and don’t have enough fund to travel for that long either. But yes that would be nice to be able to just take off and never return. 

If and when the time comes I will take my leave and just disappear. I think it’s easier on people back home if they don’t know if I’m dead or alive. Just missing. Cos I think knowing that I committed suicide would be even more painful."
SuicideWatch,etl5c6d,t1_essh15q,1562922384.0,But if I tell them I know I will lose my partner and my family and probably even extended family. I see posts on Facebook every now and then that triggers me. I just saw one and now i am feeling overwhelmed? Anxious? I’m not sure but I just want to disappear. I don’t like that I can’t control what might happen and so there is no sense of security. I regret deeply what I did but it’s too late for regret now. I have no where to go.
SuicideWatch,ess2sug,t1_eshb9si,1562243589.0,"There really is no solution. Talking to a therapist won’t help as I know what they will suggest me do and it is something I cannot do. 

This is killing me this guilt. I really just want to disappear and never be found again. Do you have any suggestion? I need a plan for when things go wrong.

Have you ever dealt with something similar?"
SuicideWatch,esg5gr2,t1_es5ztnx,1561943666.0,"1. A few months ago
2. Nothing illegal. 

I’m not sure if I can live forever like this? Feels like it’s better if I hurt myself rather than hurt others. I know people will get hurt if I do end up hurting myself but trust me it’s much better than the truth getting out. 

I don’t even know what I’m doing on reddit. I was researching on suicide and how others have done it or how to disappear etc and one of the website comments suggested to go to reddit. 

I’m not sure what I’m trying to get from here but I think it’d be better if you were to focus on others who are having it worst."
SuicideWatch,es5u6ge,t3_c5zms0,1561628608.0,"I feel the same way. This would been my alternative to suicide but money would be an issue. 
But yes how good would it be able to just go off and disappear."
SuicideWatch,es5tupy,t1_es359r3,1561628115.0,"I did something bad and I’m afraid it will come out and if it does it would destroy everything and hurt so many people. I know it’s something that might not even happen but I am feeling paranoid. Planning for death in case that happens has been making me feel better about it as I would have a prepared exit plan if things were to get out. 

Thanks for replying I didn’t think anyone would. A lot of people on here probably have worst problems than I do and deserve more help."
