waht do you mean withe you can use their hardware for free? I am just going to guess (since i didnt find anything to it withe a quick google search) that you mean the the pcs they are running the games on for you, and that would be one of the points why there is a monthely fee monthle fee is for. 

I am quite impressed that you played though Doom Eternal on Ultra Nightmare difficulty on stadia. Hearing this, and remembering the times i played dota 2 laag/delay yes i was wronge you could succesfully play games like doom, sekiro etc. on stadia too. But i think it does feels a bit better witheout the delay (ore you see it as extra difficulty witch might be a good thing for you)

i did not know bevor stadia had a free tier. Its good that they have that, however i see one big problem withe that: onley stereo sound no surround sound. in many games (more online games) that puts you at a HUGE disadvantage. for example i do not want to play Dayz witheout surround sound. 
The other thing you also mentiont is the thing about no discounts on stadia free. This sould be seen as a normal thing, however withe free Gta5 ore steam summer sale (you get acces to bothe for free) the standart is set quite high, and no dicounts witheout paying money feels a bit like a punch in the face tbh.

My hole live i have onley played on DS ore pc so i kind of forgot that you have to pay to play online on consol. Guess that makes konsol a bit less, and stadia a bit more attraktiv. But honestly i dont thing thats the selling point for anyone, becouse if you want to play alot online you are most likely on pc anyways.

yea that i listed a a screen there was wronge of me, you do need it for everything, so technicly you could leave it out of the counting (switch for the win lel).

However also withe the screen there is one thing you overlookt: The screen must be able to display 4k to, ore it is wortheless. Such a screen can cost a bit, and is normaly just the familiy TV. A good 4k screen costs more then 100$ if you dont want to play in the living room were everybody is around thats gonna cost you. If you do happen to have a 4k screen for you own pc changes are your hole setupt is quite good, and expensiv so there isent even a reason to use stadia in the first place. 

Were i live we dont a TV so there isent even a 4k screen in the hole haus. 

I think i could force my pc to go up to 4k but then the fps would drop. My main screen cant handle 4k, becouse i bought everything withe the intention of having 1080p60fps for now, becouse lets be honest thats enought 4k is nice but not necessary.

*For the next thing i dont know if it is true* If i buy the a game forme stadia do i get the game, ore the permission to stream it?

i couldent find it online how EXACTLY is it, so i would have to read in the terms of use frome stadia, and i dont have that much time. If i get a game on steam i download it, and i have all the code on my pc. So i can copy ore change it how i want (often playing withe the programm files is the onley way to get mods for a game) as far as i know you cant do that on stadia, witch is a HUGE drowback.

If it would be law-wise that i dont buy a game, but onley the permission to stream it, i pay full price for a game, but onley get the permission to play it not the game itself. Logicwise it would make sense for stadia to do it this way, witch would be a big insolence.

I read a bit in the offical stadia faq, and found that if they are to money people playing it, and the servers are full you just cant play at all not even single player (witch makes sense since withe stadia single player is also online). Since stadia flopt that wont be a problem, but lets say it was succesfull. They just say well to bad you just have to wait untill someone locks out. That ""solution"" frome stadia to that problem feels honstly like a kick in the balls.

internet can also be a problem i live in germany and the internet in germany is lets say not exactly the best. last week i had a constant 400 ping in discord. my internet is just not reliable, so stadia wasnet an option in the first place. Of couse this isent at anny means stadias foult, but for many people just a reason not to get it 

In the end i have to say that the main reason why i (and i think many others) wont get it is becouse i like to be fully in controll of the things i payed for.

I do thing at some point in the future gaming will just be cloud based ist just not the time yet.

Btw i think it is verry funny that we have a nice discussion on a 10 deay old reddit post. Thank you.

MoeMorphism,fqw1l1w,t1_fqvxj1m,1589690345.0,"i have spend around 600$ on my pc setup. been using it for too years around 6-8 hours a day. i would say i got my money out of it. 

withe stadia you also have problems of delay witch means you cant really play games like sekiro witch would be quite sad. also once the internet is down (ore just a bit slow) you cant play games at all. 

Stadia itslef you have to pay, withe around 10$ a monthe thats 120$ a year. if you go withe consols you pay every one ore too years 400$ seeing that the consol has better performance, and you have the games at home witheout needing internet, and onley beeing a bit more then 3 times the cost thats quite good. pc is even better if you are willing to pay a bit more for a good pc you can use it easely up to easy up to 4-5 years. in that time google stadia has sucked up even more money ore around the same. 

on pc you can also play pritty much all games. the performance is also better then on stadia ore consol. one thing you sould also keep in mind is that you need to pay stadia in order to even play the games you bought there. Lets say i have 2 full price games there thats games in worthe of 120$ that is onley worthe something if i pay stadia extra 10$ a monthe withe is stupid. 
the servers could also just go down effectivly ripping me off all my money. Withe steam ore a consol on the other hand i have the games i am in controll of the things i payed for semes a bit better to me (also i dont have to pay extra in order to use them)

also even withe stadia you need some basic hardware to make it work (controller, Keybord screen etc.) so thats at least 120% + the 120% a year sor the servis itself is allready 240 withe is over half the price of a good consol. so i dont really see anny reason to use stadia at all tbh"

This all happend around 9 mothes ago its some time, but HH was great alot of people are still mad (witch is totaly justified if you ask me) also here is a video about the hole story frome hentai haven exept the betrail. So It all happend like in the Video and right after the Video ended, so the Video was made at a pont were everybody still thought FAKKU had saved us all, and there were the good guys. Fakku pulled the shit up i you can read below. (if it makes sense like this)





This was posted on the Hentai Haven website about an hour ago along with his twitter handle.
#HHisDead

This post will be removed soon so here's the truth about what's happening with HH.

I'm the creator of HH, and I've been silent for too long because I had hope things would work out. Unfortunately, it isn't going to.

HH, as you know it, is dead. FAKKU has completely taken over and booted me out. First red flag was this BS re-launch they did without even telling me. Hell, they completely stopped talking to me as soon as I handed over the website and social media credentials. Thankfully, they were stupid enough to keep using my damn CDN so I can get one last message out to you guys.

It fucking sucks it has come to this. HH was my passion project, my baby. I worked on every little detail, wrote the taglines you laughed at, designed the layout, posted the videos and helped create the community we all know and love. I couldn’t have done any of it without an awesome team to support me, and I’m thankful to every single one of you.

I had such high hopes about this whole thing. I remember emailing FAKKU in 2016 telling them about a vision I had of HH being the crunchyroll of Hentai. I've been talking to them for years on and off, I trusted them. But things never quite lined up for us to work together. When FAKKU told me (conveniently) about some legal trouble headed my way and offered to bail me out last year, I was elated. I still am in fact. But had I known that would've cost me my entire website, my baby, I would've fucking gone at it on my own, spending every cent I had to protect this community. FAKKU told me everything I wanted to hear, offering me equity, employment, all that. Told me we can't put all that in the contract right now cause the company hasn't been officially registered yet and I took them at their word. Turns out, people lie. A whole LOT when money is involved.

So what's next? I got a few ideas. Follow my exploits over at @realpapahh for any announcements. DM me if you want. I got that newly unemployed free time.

TLDR; FAKKU played me like a cum-stained violin.

Sayonara,
Papa HH
