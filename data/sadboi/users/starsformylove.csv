kpopthoughts,fr2zeg4,t3_gmc0a8,1589846865.0,"Dispatch timing man.. it's always just so uncanny 

As an aroha I'm legit really worried. Since we just got done with promoing, it looks really bad on eunwoo's part for not social distancing. One of the shows Eunwoo is a fixed cast member on, Master is the House was filmed yesterday while the news broke, and now the board for that show is full of netziens requesting he be kicked off. It's like 5 pgs long. It's honestly so insane how this is blowing things out of proportion.

So far only 2 fansites I know have closed, some kfans are selling their PC collection. For me it's hard to see since I feel like astro is on the come up. Tbh this is the only time I'm happy that no one in Korea knows that Cha Eunwoo is a part of astro or even care who astro is. It could really hurt their image. Most aroha's are supportive, but of course the Eunwoo solo stans dropped him like a fly, and to that I say good riddance.

Also am afraid for Jaehyun, it seems like NCT 127 was just getting Korean fans at a fast momentum, and I hope this doesn't ruin some of those fans that were thinking about stanning. Luckilyy 127 has mostly international fan base in America so they're more understanding."
kpopthoughts,fqwm9y8,t1_fqv1tv2,1589709715.0,"Actually within the three months that I wrote that my stance has changed. At first I was very hesitant because who wouldn't be. No one wants to see their ult bias group on a survival program especially one made by m-net, but after this recent come back seeing how things were with charting, I honestly feel like astro needs to go on. As you said it would really help Rocky and Moonbin the most. Astro are top-notch performers and I know they would really kill every challenge that they tried their hands at. 

Even though I hate m-net and their elimination system for road to Kingdom, I think the long-term outcome would outweigh the short-term pain, if you will, of going on a survival program. Just watching the results oh my girl have right now, I know that could be Astro if they participate on Kingdom. after seeing that performance is really hard not to fall in love with these boys and I know they are perfect for the Korean general public to get with. Sigh"
kpopthoughts,fqwlwrq,t3_gl9fnz,1589709315.0,"A lot of these are pretty well know, although I would consider them underrated, I wouldn't consider them super unknown. For some hidden gems might I suggest 

UNVS - very melondy heavy tracks, simulator to victon I would say. Give you Up is a really pretty song

Dongkidz - LUPIN IS STILL IN MY PLAYLIST man it just one of my favorite releases the concept and choreography is just just *chefs kisses* also pretty great live

KNK - probably the most known of this list but man I love them so much.. I just wish they would get at least some recognition"
kpopthoughts,fqwlf1m,t1_fqwkcg3,1589708773.0,"ONF mv are SO cinematic, every shot is very beautiful. Plus the space / andriod concept is really interesting. You pair that with just KILLER songs. WOW man. Truly a gem. Their whole discography is just amazing and I really wish people would give them a chance. 

Also Hyojin has one of the best voices in kpop I ever heard. I hope more people get to know then through R2K."
kpopthoughts,fqwl79d,t1_fqwemsd,1589708540.0,"Yes thanks for mentioning Astro! I would agree with all your points. It's been really hard getting the Korean GP to have interest in the group  as a whole, but every comeback it seems they get stronger and bigger

I would say in general Rocky is a hidden gem, he is honestly good at everything, singing, dancing, produceing, rap. A perfect all arounder, and Moonbin is no just a great proformer. yes they have mild success but I hope that they gain more."
kpopthoughts,fqociwb,t3_gjxf7w,1589512202.0,"They are having like a full concert Marathon live on their YouTube this weekend, it lasts for like two entire days I don't know if I can sit through that much but I'm probably going to end up watching on Sunday.

kpop,fqn3vjh,t1_fqmj5yh,1589488227.0,"To be honest my best guess is because NCT dream only had a cameback to promote their concert on Vlive which was this past weekend, plus SM rn is stacking their CBs like crazy cause next week is NCT 127, then Baekhyun's."
kpop,fqn3671,t1_fqllos8,1589487886.0,"I think it's maybe because of the virus and all, which cancels fansigns, add in the fact that Fanmu didn't sell signed albums like they did for literally every other cd release Astro has had. 

Astro is holding  chances for video fanmeets right now but the way to get ln isn't like regular ones, so it doesn't give fansites and others a reason to buy albums in bulk."
kpopthoughts,fqmmxpo,t1_fqmikdq,1589480117.0,"I'm definitely slowly getting into them. I really love bright / cute concepts, so I can really see myself falling heavily for their earlier tracks. I watched a few like Genie and man I really love it.

unpopularkpopopinions,fqiu6pi,t1_fqitdg8,1589400944.0,"Oh I'm not trying underestimate his popularity at all, I was just talking on to the point of Moonbin's potential popularity. With Eunwoo I think it was 50% fanmu choosing the right opportunities and 50% luck. You really can't guess who will catch Fire and when, but you sure as hell can estimate.

This is also not to say that he doesn't deserve all the popularity he has, Eunwoo is very talented and has such a huge heart. He deserves all the success he has right now and I'm happy for him."
unpopularkpopopinions,fqiknd6,t1_fqijy3e,1589397266.0,"I can agree to that. I think eunwoo was a safe bet with that face and all. Fanmu in general is a pretty ""safe"" company and honestly pretty dated in the way they approach ...everything so I'm not surprised."
unpopularkpopopinions,fqijgis,t3_gitjip,1589396812.0,"I think one of the key things you're forgetting is that fanmu is a small company and they originally came from actors so the connections they have is obviously going to be dramas and not within the K-pop realm. They literally couldn't promote on music shows for an entire year and a half. The only way they could promote was on dramas and I think that's why Eunwoo was pushed in the public eye as much as he could because he had ""the look"" so to speak.

If you look at the early rookie i-teen predebut content from Astro I think they had every intention of pushing moonbin and even rocky in the public eye as you are expecting. I think they did a good job in 2016 and 2017 getting as much as gigs as they could for a small company that was modeled after a HEAVILY DATED vers of kpop. Aka busking, a lot of college prefromances, but at the time they just didn't have the resources to push Kpop content. If you look at how Astro was advertise back in the day it was literally (and still is) through fanmu dramas and reality shows. Now that is good if you're going to become an actor, but not so good if you're trying to display talent like moonbin and rocky have. 

Ever since fanmu got their footing back in 2019, I think they started heavily pushing moonbin into the public eye. He's been on magazine covers, mcing, acting, all that jazz since then. I'm sure now after thier first major broadcast win, things will come Moonbins way more. 

Also on a side note, Moonbin has anxiety, which he has had since 2018, which is why he set out of the Blue Flame promotion. I'm heavily guessing that's why fanmu hasn't pushed him super hard. Fantagio made him take a break, but this was all revealed to aroha's about 3 weeks ago. It might seems surprising but Fantagio actually care about there idols. 

As for Rocky it's actually surprising to know that he is the least famous member, even when comparing to Jinjin, and MJ. His naver searches are always the lowest. I really don't know the reason for this but I think it's just that the public has yet to see his talent and it's really upsetting when he is one of the most talented and well-rounded Kpop idols in the industry right now.

Sorry for this wall of text, but yeah I do think moonbin could be higher on a scale of popularity then Eunwoo but tbh I think all of Astro can. I think he was just marketed because of the connections fanmu had at the time."

I mean it also helps that that stage set design is so freaking crazy lol.  

Also that jinjin fancam, my friend has been joking that he look like colonel sanders and lol its so cute I LOVE HIM. I honestly will not shut up about ANY of the WYCMN stages. they all are so so cute. I like the Show Champ one the best I think, but it's honestly so hard to choose and came down to the fact that I don't like bins bandanna shirt lol so picky I know, BUT MYUNGJUNS OVERALLS AND HEART STICKERS SIGH ...just love them all....

also to add in [Astro in suspenders has been the best thing since all night era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0MpC1Mboyo), idk what it is but  [god bless the stylist for it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAB6Yu_2Ivo)"

It's really hard not to fall in love with them once you get to know their personalities and the group dynamic! They are so fun and like a family with each other! It's honestly so cute. I love them so much.

I know your new but some key info:

* almost all Astro plays and doccas subbed on their vlive but not all of them are on YouTube so if you are watching lives check there first!

as for video recs I recommend watching:

* [Astro in Kazakhstan.... Oh man one of the funniest astro plays ever](https://youtu.be/YNHLPS9f75A)
* [Astro on When manager falls asleep... I STILL LAUGH ITS SO FUNNY](https://youtu.be/eBzI_Q-XRls)
* [this iconic Kstyle interview](https://youtu.be/EQgIe8HYcLA)
* [the entirety of opening act of war ](https://youtu.be/S4srVvIaxI4)THE CHAOS
* [The Immigration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHrO6XaPTNE)... iconic

These are honestly the basics and there are so much more lol

It might be a little crazy since we arohas take comebacks so seriously because we want a win, so sorry if it's a little intense. It might be like trying to catch up with a moving bus haha but I hope that doesn't scare you.

I know the case between txt and Astro are MASSIVELY different but try not to think to much about wins and instead try your best and have fun. In my opinion, a successful comeback isn't measured by how many wins. Just charting within top 20 is successful within its own right for all groups."

As for 2pm. They are hilarious. As always I will suggest listening to the music first but definitely check out their Idol Army Show episodes which are old but funny af.

As for second gen recs I suggest 2pm. They're having kind of a resurgence right now in Korea which is much deserved. They have a lot of R&B songs, and a really strong discog. I highly suggest listening to Grown. It's one of my favorite albums ever

I really thought this is going to be a friendly competition but they're making it into a another produce 101 and I shouldn't have expected anything less.

And I know this is going to sound real shity but I know that if TOO, mnets own ass group isn't the group is eliminated. then there's some f****** rigging going on.

kpopthoughts,fohfgh9,t1_fohf5s5,1587765039.0,"Oh for sure! everyone's been excited for his comeback since the article came out in January 💀. I personally don't believe anything until teasers are released but I like to speculate lol. I want him to come back soon but, I'm okay if he doesn't. I totally understand."
kpopthoughts,fohdzre,t1_foh3lkq,1587764361.0,"I wonder if he is gonna play a new solo song at the concert on Saturday? 🤔 

I saw a picture floating around that his CB is scheduled for May 25th lol which would explain his insta post Replay 2020.  It would also be a nice SHINee world anniversary gift."
kpopthoughts,fohdnr1,t3_g7fgad,1587764212.0,"Definitely excited for Astro but they are my ults so that should be obvious lol but the concept is really interesting! It's a time travel themed mixed with the ocean?!? I have never seen anything like it in kpop. 

I know there has been a few time travel concepts but all the ones I seen so far have been dark, like Monsta X, but this one is bright 🤯 so I have no idea what the song is gonna sound like or what the MV is gonna look like. Many aroha has already guessed that they will go back to past MVs like breathless which could be the case. With whatever happens, I'm super excited how they will mix this time travel concept with the sea themed. 

They released an identity film and we all thought it was gonna be a dark space themed concept also it would connect to Blue Flame, but I'm glad they stepped away for the dark concept. To many BGs are doing that rn. It is forsure refreshing. 

If you want you can see the pics here. Personally I like the Time Travel shoot in the desert more but astro lounging on a yacht, I mean why not lol Check out 아스트로 (@offclASTRO): https://twitter.com/offclASTRO?s=09

---------------------

I'm also super excited for GWSN. I am kinda disappointed that it doesn't seem like the MV will go with their past concept but we all knew that storyline was done with Girls in the Park part 3 so I guess I was just holding onto hope lol. I also think the pictures they released so far are kinda boring considering thier previous concept...

However AS EXPECTED the songs sound amazing. I was low key worried since they changed companies but I feel like the Bazooka is gonna be on repeat all summer."

unpopularkpopopinions,fo3zdvd,t3_g5ig9z,1587495547.0,"I wasn't going to say anything but honestly as a shawol this post hurts to read. If we say it's insensitive why keep bringing it up, Why keep making the comparison? You say it's  harmless but shawols have numerous times been vocal in saying that the comparison is insensitive and harmful and to them. As a shawols, as a blinger I ask that you respect our opinion on this. If we say that we don't like the comparison then why you keep making it.

Also this is not at all how re-incarnation works....

I would say both 2pm and ZE:A, almost every member of those groups are actors, and most have been kdrama leads. Both Hyungsik and Taecyeon are very popular actors. Especially with the resurgence of 2pm My House and growing popularity in SK right now, I've seen so many people praise 2pm on thier visuals in the past month."

kpopthoughts,fnwurer,t1_fnwnbzw,1587325846.0,"Block B totally feels like a 2end gen group. I feel like cutting second gen off at 2010 is somewhat deceiving. That would mean that Infinite who debuted in 2010 would be at the end, and BAP who debuted in 2013 wouldn't even be counted. 

If I'm not mistaken, both inspirit and Baby both consider themselves second gen.🤔"

 I feel like your parents are maybe low-key becoming fans and just wake you up to have a reason too. If so that would be hilarious. I would wake up for a 30 sec clip of Taemin."
kpopthoughts,fnuef59,t3_g3sfzt,1587260226.0,I wonder the same thing with ONF but the show was a flop. Now thinking about it I really have no idea why it did so bad. Maybe because it was airing the same time as the UNIT but both didn't do super great. In the end both seemed like a waste of time for the groups involved
unpopularkpopopinions,fnsskkj,t3_g3ptnv,1587227996.0,"Now thinking about it I feel like you are right. A lot of fans really disliked WJSN debut track MoMoMo when it dropped. I remember people being like wtf, it wasn't until thier first comeback Secret when people started to like thier music. Of course this is a very broad generalization but in general that's what I saw online. 

I wouldn't know about Sistars Push Push, but I do know its not one of the tracks that pushed them to stardom. It wasn't until Alone when they really got famous.

Maybe across the board starship just sucks at debuts lmao"

kpopthoughts,fnpb56h,t3_g34ltd,1587142412.0,It should have been thier first win. Everything about it is amazing. That MV is still one of my top 10 in Kpop even after 4 years. Also the song.. the song is a timeless bop. I honestly listen to it on repeat.

unpopularkpopopinions,fnmmmda,t1_fnmh3ol,1587074178.0,"Idk about that cause although Pentagon seem relatively known internationally they aren't know at all really in Korea. The Boyz and Golden Child both had their first wins already but Pentagon who debuted in 2016, both a year before TBoyz and GolCh, have not yet. It has been 4 years without a first win for them and they took a really huge beating in popularity when edawn left.

also if you look at the polls The Boyz are leading rn with Pentagon in 3rd mostly cause international fans cant vote.

this is also coming from a person who knows very little about pentagon. I only knows like 3 songs lol"
unpopularkpopopinions,fnmloom,t3_g22zkd,1587073690.0,"I get what you're saying. I hesitant on Oneus and Verivery joining for the same reasons you are but looking at the debuts last year, and how maxed out they were, I think both groups could benefit from the show, so I don't have a huge problem with them. I think Pentagon, The Boyz, and Golden Child are underrated enough to be on there as well. Maybe not as much as ONF but still.. enough.

the only one I have a big problem with is TOO because they were created by Mnet, it's such an overt promotion that I really don't think it's fair especially with the entire produce scandal. That slot could have got to KNK and i wish it would have."
unpopularkpopopinions,fnmkw06,t1_fnka9yb,1587073271.0,"I agree with TOO, I really get a bad taste in my mouth that they are included at all. I think the boys are obviously great but it's such a blatant way to get mnet's own group exposure."

Astroad 2 stage outfits, the all white title neck suits and the black/ navy pin striped suits.. both a serve

unpopularkpopopinions,fngdc8c,t3_g1g30m,1586928814.0,"I honestly have to agree with you, but I think that sub has a loose definition of what a nugu is. I feel like the mods think nugu it's just a group that isn't mid-tier and/or hasn't got their first win yet, but that's just my judgement. 

Even with the the nugu awards that was up this past year I thought weren't so nugu. There was a whole discussion on the main r/kpop subreddit when Loona was nominated for everything. I remember reading past the comments and it was a pretty lively discussion if whether or not a group like Loona and Dreamcatcher, who are TECHNICALLY nugu but totally dominate the sub should be nominated. Idk It comes down to the elusive definition of what a nugu is.

But if u wanted some not super rookie nugu artist to check out here's a list of the ones I enjoy:

Dongkiz
Saturday
Snuper
Lime Soda
Nature
Ariaz
Onf
OnlyOneOf
DreamNote
100%
Cherry on Top
7 o'clock
In2it

Idk you can check them out if u want but those are just my suggestions 😉"

kpopthoughts,fnbcnct,t3_g0rfl8,1586813174.0,"As a 2end gen stan I would be inclined to agree with you but idk man I found some gems of groups in 3rd gen that i truly love.

I got into kpop in 2013 with SNSD being the first kpop group I ever listened to and then I fell in love with F(x) and SHINee. During that time I was a multi for everyone lol. My personal favorites being SNSD, F(x), SHINee, Wonder Girls, After School, Infinite, aoa, Apink, 2pm, and Beast. (For some reason I wasn't much of a YG Stan but that's besides the point lol) 

For a while I couldn't find any newer groups that caught my eye and with all my ults disbanding / military enlistment, I really thought I was gonna drop kpop but I found some groups that have that second gen flavor so to speak. Groups I found like this are Oh My Girl, ONF, Astro, Lovelyz, and sometimes seventeen and early twice. Even in 4th gen there is Dongkiz and Verivery that give me a heavy shinee vibe lol Idk but honestly that's just my personal view. 

Even though I do miss 2end gen I think 3rd gen has really good groups and songs that are bops...Also let's not pretend that every song in second gen was great. There was truly some bad songs made that to this day I wonder why they released that 😂💀. Lol

In conclusion .. all gens have hits and misses, and summer combacks just don't hit as good without Sistar lol"
unpopularkpopopinions,fn92tnv,t3_g00oxq,1586757550.0,"One perk I found when getting a cheap nose bleed ticket is that you get to see the lightstick oceans which is always a great when your all singing among and moving to the same song. Also there is no pressure to be there 5 hours early lol and wait in line, also if your over 21, you can chill and have a drink. 

I set top tier at the twice lights concert and honestly it was great. Yeah I couldn't see them but 1) I saved money 2) I'm more of a casual once 3) it was nice just being there. 4) I got to drink a beer while fanchanting to freaking TT.. it was great. Tbh being able to go to any concert is a God send to me."
unpopularkpopopinions,fn84r6c,t1_fn83b11,1586733876.0,"True but then SHINee would be left no lead dancer... At the time of debut I think key maybe could have filled in the gaps but .. not really. The rest of SHINee got better at dancing as the years went by while teamin in debut years had to fill that role. I think suho is a good dancer but couldn't fill that gap.

Plus that would leave SHINee with 3 main vocalist and Jjong and Onew during debut already took up most of the lines. I feel like Jjong and suho have kinda a similar voice so idk if that would work really...

But I would like a suho / Onew collab now lol that would be 🔥👌"
