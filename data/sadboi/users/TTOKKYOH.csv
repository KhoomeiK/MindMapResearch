Passive:When gettin back a friend the little turtle will keep the shield for 5 seconds more


Tatical:Doctor Will heal whenever you want, but he will need to charge up, he will heal faster but not giving that much of a heal

Its like you can pick what kinda heal you want

Ultimate:Lifeline brigs a Beacon and a Care package that includes 1 blue tier full equipped gun, 1 blue chest armor and 1 heal, the beacon will rest for 20 seconds, if not used lifeline will recieve part of the cooldown back

This would be good cause it would help crypto gettin a little rework too"
