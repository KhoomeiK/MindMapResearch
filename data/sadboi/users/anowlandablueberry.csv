The major benefit was that I had access to a range of specialists who were intently focussed on crisis mental health and making sure I was okay enough to cope again outside. I saw psychologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists as well as doctors, nurses and a pharmacist. Everything they did towards my mental health plan was tailored and individualised, which really helped.

The downside was that depressive and suicidal patients are not the primary focus of a psychiatric ward. It was both immensely boring and left me with too much time to think. There are obviously a lot of rules in place, meaning for me the environment was incredibly stifling. And I‚Äôm not gonna lie, shit got cray in there sometimes as a great many of the other patients were there for acute mental episodes. 

I was there for 10 days. It was not the most pleasant experience of my life and I don‚Äôt wish to go back. However, I know that without it, I would not have gotten the help I needed and the leg up out of the black hole that I did.

Gradeshopping pisses the hell out of us. And moderation is a thing.

Then usually random papers that have been marked are cross marked with another teacher to make sure we are still on track with each other while marking. A student coming up to me to get something remarked or scouting a second opinion is pretty damn rude when you consider we work with the rubrics every day - before you were a student and long after you‚Äôve gone. It‚Äôs literally our *profession*. Far more often that not, students have either a) disregarded key information/advice/instructions leading to errors in the paper; b) think that their effort should determine their grade; or c) realise upon having the feedback explained to them that the teacher was indeed correct in their assessment and they missed the mark."
