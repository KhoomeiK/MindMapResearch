unpopularopinion,fqy7oen,t3_gicic5,1589743994.0,"White people saying Corona memes are racist can fuck off.

As an Asian American, when we still had school and students made Corona jokes, teachers (white) would scold them to not make them because it was racist then apologize to me. As soon as I saw Corona’s potential I made jokes about it too, even though I’m Asian. In English we get to talk a lot about opinions so the teacher brought a board so we could write some issues we thought were important. I wrote things like China, HK, Tiktok, etc. These were anonymous so she thought a white person had said that for ongoing virus. I was obviously the one who wrote it because of communism and my views politically we’re pretty much known to the whole class.
She went on a whole tangent on how it was racist and my peers were looking at me because they obviously knew I was a memer and was the one who made jokes on corona and wrote the things I wrote because I’m a big Hong Kong supporter.
It’s pretty stupid when white people start apologizing to me. Most races will probably make jokes about their own race so when a white person makes them it’s no different than their own race. When a white person apologizes for being racist just because they’re white, it takes that person out of group because now they have to feel like a victim.
This really applies to any race not just Asians."
