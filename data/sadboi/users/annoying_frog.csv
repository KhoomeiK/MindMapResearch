unpopularopinion,fiqy4og,t3_f974b0,1582653705.0,"My parents chose to have six children knowing my mother was a carrier for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Both of my brothers have the disease. They were born relatively normal, but their muscles have degraded over time. My older brother, 24, must get his nutrients through a feeding tube & requires 24 hour supervision. That includes an overnight nurse to monitor him. 

Almost my entire life living with my parents revolved around taking care of my brothers. We were extremely poor as my mother eventually stopped working to take care of the house/kids. My father barely worked so we would not lose our benefits & they collected the government's money. 

I would not want anybody to have the childhood I had. Once my parents no longer had food stamps, we barely had food around the house. My sisters & I were not allowed to do any school activities or have a job through high school because my parents would not drive us anywhere or allow us to leave the house. My brothers were bought video games, of course, but for us, they were just an unnecessary distraction from our school work. The only thing that mattered was staying at home to take care of my brothers & studying for school.

Sorry for rambling now. But I guess what I'm trying to convey is that my parents choosing to have disabled children (& too many children at that) definitely impacted my life for the worse. It's weird hearing my fiance & his friends talk about all the crazy & fun things they did as kids, because I don't have any of those kinds of stories. I never had friends in school. I became severely depressed. My life was not my own. & it's because of the choices my parents made."
