hapas,fp97b5i,t3_gc4it8,1588417094.0,"My mother was adopted by white people and actively discouraged my sister and I from learning anything about Korea and now I’m playing catch-up. In my experience Koreans are much more welcoming to half Koreans who speak the language. Even if your husband is indifferent, it’s kind of both of your obligation to teach them. They’ll be treated differently than others because they’re mixed race and because they’re Asian. It might be subtle or it could be blatant. And speaking from experience, white-washed Asians and half-Asians get a lot of bullshit from people, much more than Americanized Asians and half-Asians who are also in touch with their heritage.

Speaking as a halfie and someone who’s known a lot of halfies. You should teach them about Korea and have them learn the language so they don’t resent you and this isn’t a source of pain for them later in life."
AsianMasculinity,fnn9r0b,t1_fnbi9jr,1587087518.0,"Nah I’ve had black dudes joke and act like they wanna fight me and then we’ll laugh or hug. I’ve also had black dudes be thrilled I’m dating a black girl cause they know I’m cool.

Then there are race purists who get in my face and talk shit. You’re ignorant.

Edit: I’ve also had black people threaten to kill me for dating black women. Including one girl’s father who threatened to kill me, her, and any kids we’d have cause “no daughter of mine is gonna marry a chinaman.” Fuck outta here."
hapas,fnn9d8p,t3_g2hlfj,1587087277.0,"Umm since you asked...lemme think. Let me preface this by saying many Koreans have been kind to me and encouraged me to be proud of myself and defended me being Korean. I’m currently learning Korean and doing a lot to try and learn that side of my heritage. The history, culture, customs, manners, pop culture, recipes, and whatnot. Some of the best friends I’ve ever had were Koreans or half-Koreans who taught me how to take pride in being Korean and showed me a lot of the culture.

Here are some of the racist experiences I’ve had with Koreans, almost every single one of these instances have also been done to me by people of other races and/or ethnicities too. 

They say my mom was a hooker (she wasn’t). When I court or date a Korean or Asian girl in general they call me a colonist, when I date or court white women they call me colonized. When I date or court women who aren’t Korean or white they make fun of me or say I like “darkies.” 

They threaten me and try to fight me. Say my mother should’ve killed me as a baby. Call me a mutt, mongrel, and abomination. They tell me I’m not a real Korean.

They call me a Neanderthal and a barbarian since I’m half white. 

They ostracize me. Sometimes they make me feel welcome then pull the rug out from under me making thinly veiled insults about how, “things are better in their pure form.” They’ll include me when talking badly about other groups but then exclude me when they’re not. I’m Korean to them when it’s useful to them. When it’s not I’m just some mutt.

Some Korean people who tried really hard to include me were reprimanded by their friends “he’s one of us,” they’d say while their friends would reply, “you’re too nice, he’s not a stray puppy, he’s a mutt.” 

Sometimes Korean women who want to marry white men and have half-white kids and Korean men who want to marry white women and have half-white kids loudly say insulting things about me. Some of those people go on and on about race purity. I guess I remind them of the implications of their actions since they’re idiots who want to have an interracial marriage and biracial children, but they haven’t thought things through or gotten rid of their prejudices which those types will inevitably take out on their children. I’ve never understood why a race purist would reproduce with, marry, or even date someone of a different race, but I always say, people are morons.

There is much much more, but that’s a decent summary."

Weirdly enough since I started dating I haven’t had a period where I quit doing that. I didn’t piece that together until now. I was either seeing someone, or if I was single, going wild. 

I did, however, go through a really long period where I actively avoided making new friends and even spurned people’s friendships partially because of some bad experiences that jaded me, but mostly because no one really understood me on a racial level. I had friends of a lot of races and even part Asian friends, but the only ones with similar life experiences didn’t like talking about it. So I got sick of being surrounded by people who said problematic shit or didn’t get me on that level. Which looking back on it, it’s natural to want community, but I was being stupid as fuck. Now I’m open to it and slowly making new friends and repairing some old friendships that I let wither because those friends stuck around.

I’m sure you’ll find someone if you open yourself up to the possibility again. It might take a while and a lot of effort to find someone you click with but you’ll get there dude."

I’m only now starting to really explore my Korean heritage. I’ve dabbled in it since I was a kid, but now I’m really learning the language, learning about the culture and history, and exploring more. I’m a few years younger than you and feel like I’m a few years behind you on a similar journey.

As for dating, I can relate to all of that too. Although some Asian or part Asian women have like a fetish for me since I’m mixed. I’ve never had trouble getting a girlfriend, but when it comes to finding a partner who’s an equal and doesn’t think of herself as better than me or lower than me, I’ve had more luck with non-Asian women, although I’ve had different problems in that realm. Good luck with everything!"

Seriously though, I agree with your overall message, but every time I try to be less bitter about things and see the world through a more positive lens, some racist, sometimes even traumatic and violent shit happens to me that makes me even more bitter. And I’m not talking about things I provoked or escalated. I’ve had people pull and point weapons at me while I was walking down the street minding my own business and the people around me didn’t give a fuck or I felt like they might form a group and kill me.

While “if everyone you meet is an asshole, you might be the asshole,” is true, there are towns, counties, and even cities I hate going to because I know everyone will be an asshole to me and the people will likely shout slurs at me, threaten me, or brandish weapons at me. Conversely, there are areas I go to because I know people are friendly to people who look like me there and I’m less likely to experience harassment or I will at least not have to fear for my life. If everyone’s an asshole to you in an area where you are a minority and another group is a majority, you should try taking a trip somewhere where more people look like you and see if you get treated differently outside of the fishbowl.

I make some political posts because I’m trying to convey a history and opinions that are not exclusively mine, to the mixed people in here who may not know about them and to the monoracial lurkers who genuinely want to educate themselves. I personally enjoy when mixed people make political posts in here, even when I disagree or end up arguing with them. Because where I’m from a ton of Asian, part Asian, and even some other mixed people are meant to feel like their opinions don’t matter and that they need to sit down and shut up while the “more important” groups talk. People straight up infantilize Asian people when they try to speak on their issues around here. White people pull the “you should be grateful to be here card” other minorities will tell you they know next to nothing about Asian American history or western imperialism in Asia then in the same breath will play the “My group had it worse than your group so shut the fuck up” card. Some things need to be said online because irl you’re not allowed to have a voice."

I was kind of a punk growing up so I had some run ins with the cops, but usually I was doing something stupid and I’m more mad I got caught than that the cops stopped me and sometimes cursed at me and my friends. Also because I was respectful and I suspect because of my race, I got verbal warnings for things other kids had gotten arrested for. 

The only times that were weird were times I was walking alone and got randomly stopped and patted down. Sometimes the cops were hostile, looking for a fight, and I just kept my mouth shut, other times I resembled a suspect in the area and the cops were chill.

One of those times an Asian guy and a black guy had robbed a store together a few hours before and so these two white cops stopped me and talked to me. They apologized because they knew it probably wasn’t me since the guy was described as having longer hair and darker skin. I think I was 13 at the time.

They found knives in my pocket, asked what they were for and tensed up, but I was in the middle of saying “officer, I think I should inform you” when he pulled one knife out of my front pocket and said “is this what you were going to tell me about?” I said “yes sir, there’s another one in my left cargo pocket.” He told me to pull it out slowly with the tips of my fingers, I did it and handed it to him.

They asked me why I had those and I told them I spent a lot of time in the woods so one of them was for whittling and making kindling and the other was for self defense because occasionally you’d see methheads in the woods. One of the knives was illegal, it was about an inch and a half too long, but they let me keep it and gave me a verbal warning because I told them my dad gave me the knife and it was important to me. They told me not to carry it on me and if I’d run into someone who wasn’t as nice they might’ve kept the knife, arrested me, or implied I might’ve been beat up or shot for having it. They also warned me to stay out of a certain section of woods, (colored kids knew not to go near there and would get those warnings a lot) because the people there were “funny and dangerous, not haha funny, but there’s something wrong with some of them” and that they used to hang people back in the day. Some people actually threatened to hang me there a few years later.

They also made remarks like “see? Asian people cooperate, it’s nice dealing with them because they follow instructions, answer your questions, and they’re cool with being stopped in cases like this. Then you just send them on their way.”

Other times I was stopped and patted down I was usually hanging out with black or Latino people. That was much more tense and I did all the talking. I even had to tell one of my friends to “shut the fuck up or I’ll deal with you later” when he was being a smart ass. My friend took the hint, the cops tensed up a bit more when I said that, but seemed to like the idea that I was in charge which was exactly what I was going for. Then they’d tell me to keep my friends in line and be careful of the company I kept. There are racist cops who have shot Asians, including East Asians, but in my experience, black and LatinX people have it way worse."

Now some advice. When was born I was pale. I had white blonde hair and eyebrows and looked like a white child. As I’ve gotten older I steadily looked more and more Asian. I still get mistaken for a white man occasionally, but in general, most people think I’m Asian, mixed, or Latino. If your kid looks different as they get older, don’t repeatedly make remarks about it, even saying that in a seemingly innocuous way can make them feel like an outcast or like something is wrong with them. 

Also if one of your kids looks more white while the other one looks more Asian, for the love of God do not treat them differently and don’t fawn over one of their good looks while putting down the other one. I’ve had friends irl whose parents did that and they are extremely bitter and angry people for good reason."

hapas,fgycyjn,t1_fgvm8q5,1581181999.0,"Hey, things will get better. The proof is right here, you’re talking about this shit and you’ve obviously started looking into the roots of the problems you’re having.

When I was a little kid (4 or 5) my first kiss was a little blonde girl that I had a crush on for ages, she literally chased me, pinned me against a wall, and kissed me. That made my parents ridiculously happy, they’ve always been obsessed with me marrying a white woman and giving them “mostly white grandchildren”. A few months later the school called my parents. A teacher had caught me and two other boys kissing each other in the hallway.

I remember what happened next vividly because it went on for at least a week. My dad said “these damn spics are making MY SON gay because of their corrupt culture.” My mom said that made no sense and asked “what if he’s gay?” My dad kept raging about reasons why that couldn’t be true and repeating “no son of mine is a faggot” “look at him, he already looks and acts manly except for this weirdness, why are you insulting my son?” My mom kept bringing it up then eventually said “ok he obviously likes girls, but haven’t you noticed the way he acts around some boys? What if he’s bisexual?” My parents would get into epic screaming matches at that point and throw things at each other and although I never saw it, apparently my dad hit my mom. He hit my sister and I so it makes sense. 

You could hear everything in that apartment. What sticks out to me is my mom kept broaching this subject in a calm, even voice. When she raised her voice during those conversations it was never malicious or in a mocking tone like I’d usually hear. She seriously just wanted my dad to at least talk about the fact that I might be queer. My dad screamed at me not to do anything like that again and told me “you’re not to behave like that. You like girls. You’re not a faggot.” For like a month or two after that he’d randomly shout things like that at me, completely out of the blue. Growing up my dad would routinely talk about how the people killing LGBTQ people were doing “God’s work” and when my cousin came out as a lesbian he ranted a bit about wanting to kill her. He’s calmed down a bit since then, but I’m never going to come out to him. I don’t want to be in a position where I have to kill my dad in self defense or where he’s trying to kill me. 

Hehe. This doesn’t even delve into the racism he spewed when I was a kid. 

Things will get better."
hapas,fgy8p5f,t1_fgvizcb,1581180674.0,My dad would make Asian men’s “accents” and squint his eyes while doing “impressions” (caricatures) of Asian men. He also rants about Asian women being evil gold diggers since he and my mom had a messy divorce. Fucking asshole.
hapas,fgy83iu,t1_fgx30m6,1581180482.0,"You just described my father. I’m his only biological kid. Yet he rants for hours at a time about how the white birth rates are too low and how “the wrong types of immigrants are taking over this country.” And how the 1950s were the golden age of America because it was mainly white people here? Not true, but ok. 

Like dude. Your one biological child is half Asian and you’re ranting to said child about this, wtf is wrong with you? He wonders why I never call, it’s not just because he was abusive when I was a kid, it’s cause he rants about this shit and talks about how great and classy Donald Trump is pretty much every time I try to have a conversation with him."
hapas,fgy6yn4,t3_f0luji,1581180108.0,"Ugh I relate to this so hard, dude.

Especially your dad telling your mom she should be “grateful.” My parents would tell me I should be “grateful” for being half white. Like. What?

A lot of their racist friends said similar shit to me or even worse shit unprovoked and I’d get in trouble for saying something back.

My dad said some things about Asian cultures being “primitive” one example he used was “European cultures have so many utensils while Asian cultures only have chopsticks and maybe spoons.” Because my parents are walking contradictions sometimes he’d say that East Asian cultures (only East Asian) were the only cultures to rival and possibly even surpass European cultures, sometimes literally five minutes after talking about how primitive all Asian culture is.

Your parents screaming at you that you’re white and not Asian? I can relate to that too.

I’m glad you’re getting this shit out of your system dude. Before I started talking about this it was poisoning me and contributed to me being a toxic person and getting more and more jaded. After years of being beaten and screamed at and gaslit to the point where I didn’t feel comfortable talking about this stuff in general, it feels good to finally expose it and talk about it. Even if it’s on the internet “anonymously.”"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fgutbsw,t1_fguqzgm,1581128962.0,"To be fair, some of those comments came in before I edited my comment, the original was kind of ambiguous. 

The no true Scotsman thing is puzzling me right now. Even in the original comment I added a few qualifiers that clearly show I don’t hate feminists. I was talking about my mother who loudly proclaims herself a feminist and who is a terrible human being who abused her kids.

I am doing better, thanks for your concern. I didn’t even realize how abruptly it ended. I’m still working on myself and isolating myself a bit, but I’ve gotten better at forcing myself to call my friends back and go out. I started taking anti-depressants a few months back and it’s made a world of difference. In my life outside work, I’ve gotten more done in the last few months than I have in the last few years."
hapas,fguasvy,t1_fgs5da3,1581116350.0,"There’s a stereotype that Asian people smell funny and have poor personal hygiene. It’s an old stereotype, but still widely believed and used to ridicule people in some places. Like the trash heap I grew up in."
hapas,fguan0j,t3_f070dt,1581116241.0,"I’m thinking you might be a troll, but I’ll bite. Sometimes I smell gross to myself, like rancid milk, but other people say I smell good and say I smell either “sweet” or like “cilantro,” “rosemary,” or “pine trees”. Other days I smell like those things to myself.

I’ve noticed certain scents and colognes get positive reactions from some races and negative reactions from others. It’s anecdotal, people of other races sometimes smell “different” to each other. Sometimes someone will say I smell bad then someone else will interject and say I smell amazing. Smell is a weird sense. 

You might have some health issues or just need better personal hygiene. Eating fruits and veggies and less meat can help people smell and feel better."

Sometimes it was mischievous. He’d steal food from the pantry or would go sit in the bathtub and chill. 

Then sometimes it would be annoying as fuck. He opened the front door a few times and escaped and I’d have to chase him for miles, sometimes barefooted, while he thought we were playing and would stay just out of reach until I corralled him into a corner or he got tired of playing and wanted to go home."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgsysse,t1_fgsxqjw,1581095473.0,"Yep. Like me thinking and formerly thinking things like going to the doctor is for wimps, putting effort into personal hygiene is effeminate,  talking about your feelings as a man is wrong, and if someone looks at my girlfriend I have to confront them are all things that are toxic but were hammered into me by my family and society. Another one I’ve seen is that the man always has to take the lead in a relationship. I dated women who thought that and experienced decision making fatigue. I’ve also talked to women who dated men who thought like that and told me it was scary how controlling they are.

I do think there is toxic femininity too, things like women being conditioned to feel helpless in certain situations, not take the lead, to shut up and listen, and that they can hit men without fear of legal consequences or social stigma being examples."

I think I’ll take up weapons training and do forms and drills. I love martial arts, but I think I’m done with sparring practice and tournaments. 

Dude I feel that struggle. I love sparring. One on one, all the way up to five on one or one on five. It’s like painting a picture with your body and collaborating with your opponents and/or teammates. Since I stopped my body feels much better.

I started martial arts when I was seven years old and had an old school grandmaster who allowed head contact while sparring. I knew how to fight before I knew how to ride a bike. When I told my doctor that he winced and took a sharp breath and gently told me to give up the sport unless I think I can go pro or go to the olympics or something. I’ll take up something else like rock climbing or something to get my adrenaline fix.

Edit: the thing is, it’s not just a sport to me. It’s a lifestyle and a philosophy."

The nurses kept waking me up because they thought I was going into cardiac arrest. Then a doctor came in, asked if I did distance running or biking or something, I said both and she went, yeah he’s fine, don’t worry about it. I miss being fit."
agedlikemilk,fgrwh37,t1_fgrdp24,1581060240.0,"One of the times I’ve been knocked out, I was at karate practice sparring. I saw stars and was out for a few seconds. I literally forgot three or four people, including a girl I’d been flirting with for months until I saw them or evidence of them (calls, text messages, etc.) my doctor did some tests and said I was fine and not to worry about it, but that was weird af. When I saw those people or evidence of them it was like everything came back in a flash. There’s also a bit of a lag when I speak. It’s not noticeable because I practice, but it’s like words take a longer route from my brain to my mouth than they use to. My friends noticed I was different and worked around that for a while until I was more myself again. This guy I hung out with a ton, saw me and I acted like we’d never met before. He gently said “Eel, do you remember me, it’s Joe.” It took me two minutes to remember years of hanging out with this guy. Not just every once in a while, but doing big things like going to water parks and climbing buildings close to train tracks, swimming in a nearby creek, a lot of things. 

I’ve always been good at fighting, I love doing it for sport, I also love playing street football, but I had to give it up. My family, some friends, and girls I dated when I did those things noticed me changing. Having a harder time expressing myself, managing my anger. Multiple exes cried and told me to stop doing those activities because of how bad they are for me. One of them told me out of concern, not spite, “you’re a husk of the man I fell in love with. You’ve got a beautiful mind and you’re destroying it for an adrenaline high.” Sometimes I think I should just say fuck it and try and go pro. Make some money off my talent. I’ve already fucked up my head for dumb sports and stupid street fights. Might as well go all the way lol."
