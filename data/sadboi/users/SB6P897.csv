bipolar,fnge91o,t1_fngcg6s,1586929562.0,Oh gotcha. Yeah when I left the hospital it took me a few months to really really come back down to earth.

bipolar,fnfjlww,t1_fncqtgz,1586909325.0,"Honestly yes, but not as much as I used to miss it. It was in both cases a painful aftermath, yet a part of me looks back at the memory and thinks that something about that manic mindset before and and just after leaving the hospital in general was so beautiful. Not sure if it was just the heightened sense of purpose, but even memories of places I went to and things I did leading up to the episodes has an aura glory to it. I have found thought that the more I treasure normal things and the freedoms and beauty of reality, the small things, and the more I dive into my hobbies and skills, the less of a need I feel for that glorious delusional perspective."
bipolar,fncq2o1,t3_g0zaa5,1586843578.0,"Thank you for sharing!!! What you described with Narnia reminds me so much of my thought process especially during my first episode. It was a blur between reality, fiction and spirituality. Books, movies and music played a huge impact, such as Alice in Wonderland, The Fallen (a book about a half-angel, which i believed myself to be), and a spin-off of Jack and Jill in which I had fallen in love with a fictional Jill and searched for her. 

In my second episode I was arrested in a fast food restaurant because I was fully nude in the men‚Äôs restroom trailing off to my delusional fantasy. As the cops wrestled me down I pushed them off and said that I cannot be stopped from fullfilling God‚Äôs plan (somehow the restroom morphed into an end of the world scenario where the songs on the radio spoke to me telling me that I was the world‚Äôs only hope). Afterwards I believed the first responders that surrounded me to all be angels, and that everything was on camera for some entertainment. I even asked the cops for the cuffs I had on as a souvenir because that‚Äôs how out of touch I was to where I was."
