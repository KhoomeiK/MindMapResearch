And i don't want to promote more self harm than there already is but if u really have to cut, cut upper thigh so even in swimsuit (if you're not a girl) they won't be visible. But be careful with salt water, if you'll cut on holiday and go in the water you will react somehow and people notice, so if you want to avoid unnecessary questions, try not to cut. I believe in you :)"

Just try not to really show ur arm and avoid interactions where they can see ur cuts, it depends how observant your family is. My whole family is really ignorant so it's easier? Even tho i wish they cared more. Good luck and if you would like to talk to someone someday, you can message me."
selfharm,fpx8gr6,t1_fpx62y7,1588977690.0,"Yeah, true i'm scared of that too. It's not even June and my urges to cut my arm are higher everyday. I cut upper thighs too, because i'm scared of the reactions to my scars. I already have scars on my arm but somehow nobody noticed? or didn't said anything."
selfharm,fomn2b4,t3_g88m9i,1587896322.0,"Yep, i like my scars but i'm so afraid of people seeing them. I'm trying to overcome the fear so i hope i will."

Meanwhile all my old school ""friends"" (more like people i know) are completing schools or they're succesfull in job. And here i'm,  a nobody who cuts himself wondering if it wouldn't be better if i was dead."
