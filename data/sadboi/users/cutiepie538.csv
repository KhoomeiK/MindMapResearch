MtvChallenge,fr0mmct,t1_fr0fsod,1589800828.0,"Right, I really know nothing about U.K. culture, so most of what I say is just based off my experience and education in the US. And I do agree to an extent. Cultural appreciation is awesome and I think sharing and enjoying each other’s cultures and backgrounds is awesome. 

But there’s also things that I just don’t touch because there’s such a cultural context behind them. Like braids and hairstyles, that has such a cultural and significant background in the black community, including them being discriminated against for it, that someone who faces no discrimination on a regular basis and who doesn’t attempt to understand or be an active ally it just... isn’t cool. It appears like it’s not actively hurting anyone, but in reality, it is because it’s playing into historical and systemic forms of racism. (Also braids like that just aren’t meant for white people’s hair. It destroys it)

I treat some “slang” terms the same, like “sis” for example, me as white woman wouldn’t use that talking to a black woman because it means sister, as in a black sisterhood bond to them and I’m not part of that. 

But to say no one should use slang terms that were popularize by the black community is far fetched, mainly because most of popular slang terms originate with the black community. Think sis, snapped, finna, bet etc. At the same time it’s hard because there’s a historical background of society taking black culture and popularizing it, but ignoring the oppression black people face daily. So the idea of taking the good and leaving the bad aka the Kardashians. 

Tori herself is an example because she uses such vernacular and tones only when speaking around black people or in confessionals to seem cool or funny. So it comes off as “white girl trying to act black” and not just how someone naturally talks or some popularized slang terms."

See now Ninja is hard because we’ve only seen her for 2 seasons, which had a very strong showing and she’s definitely a great competitor. But I think WOTW2 showed she had some weaknesses that could be brought out in future seasons. Similar to how Tori’s weaknesses have. 

Now if Ninja and Tori were going head to head in an elimination, I’d probably put my money on Ninja for any strategy + physicality elim. Purely physical like a hall ball or balls in? I think Tori would win based off size. But does that make one better or lesser? I’m not sure."

Tori should realistically have a challenge win. If WOTW2 was like the team challenges the “greats” won, she would’ve been on that winning team.

Because even while they don’t mean to cause her any harm and I know come from a place of holding Jenna at a high value, I’m sure it still causes her feelings of shame and guilt and doubt. 

In all honesty, the character of Zach and his actions encompass some of the things I think are most wrong with society. But think about the people we choose to be in relationships with. We learn about their secrets, their childhood, their trauma, their hopes. We know why they do the things they do. We see how they care for us and others in deeper ways than the outside sees. These are things we can’t begin to understand about Jenna and Zach because we know them as tv personas. 

Jenna chooses to be with Zach in the real world, for reasons none of us will ever be able to comprehend. Regardless of how we feel for either of them, we need to respect their relationship because it’s theirs and not up for debate. 

Some other ways I think we can support Jenna is just by focusing on her. Supporting her passions and career and success. Uplifting her strength and determination. I personally think her ability to love and prioritize relationships is a beautiful thing that not all of us can accomplish. 

Jenna is her own amazing person outside of her relationship, I think emphasizing and uplifting that is most important."

I can assure you that Florida is handling this virus the best way it knows how, attempting to bury it."
MtvChallenge,fpgvttb,t1_fpguq8g,1588610420.0,"Omg the sounds are one of the worst parts. Ok thank goodness, thought I was the only one here! Well and TJ, he said he hates these challenges too so we’re in good company at least 😂"
MtvChallenge,fpgpidv,t1_fpgp021,1588607160.0,"See this is a happy medium I can get on board with. But knowing MTV they’ll probably put go-pros in each bucket for a real, first hand feel."
MtvChallenge,fpgnihk,t1_fpgmt95,1588606108.0,"Omg the curry challenge gave me nightmares for weeks 😖

I just rewatched Invasions and skipped that episode completely. Too traumatizing."
PoliticalHumor,fpgd8ki,t1_fpgbzf0,1588600282.0,"Yes, you’re missing the idea that Florida has been a shit show all virus and has been lying about the number of deaths to appear that they have things under control.

But hey, if you want Gov Desantis and his protocols so badly then please take him."
MtvChallenge,fpg4zwu,t3_gd7ji8,1588594412.0,"There’s just sooo much more to see from him, he’s still relatively new to the show. I think that’s what grinds my gears the most tbh, sure he’s a champ, but he’s still a rookie imo. Him manipulating people into giving him Jay to beat in a headbanger doesn’t change that."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpdzep7,t3_gcwk9l,1588537296.0,They have 34 seasons of The Challenge they could rerun but it’s always more of that damn show  smh
MtvChallenge,fpcs3r0,t1_fpcr5md,1588511133.0,I don’t know this is pretty challenge conspiracy theory 101 lol
MtvChallenge,fpcryqn,t3_gcptth,1588511020.0,"I’ve been listening to CM for a while and have been a patron for about a year. Honestly it was a shock to come on here and see that a lot of people didn’t like the podcast.

While I see the criticisms and do feel the same at times, I will say, I loveeee their bonus podcasts so much more. There’s less of a filter there and you really get to hear their true thoughts and opinions on the show. There’s a better flow because it’s much more natural. Plus this season we’ve had Mark Long, Darrel, Abram and others on their recaps and it’s super interesting. I love hearing old cast members opinions on the new episodes. 

I’ve only been to one live show, but it was really fun, mainly because you’re there with so many other super fans like yourself. There’s a lot of free flowing conversation, alcohol, and stories. Plus I mean I got to drink with CT so can I really complain?"
MtvChallenge,fp29ipv,t1_fp28ea4,1588257786.0,"The fact that you’re focusing on what body type is “desirable” is showing the point that society thinks certain body types are better than others. Calling thin women not thin perpetuates body dysmorphia. Saying skinny isn’t desirable perpetuates poor body image. 

Also BBL?? You do realize they take fat from other parts of your body to make you thin with a fat ass right?? You’re really not helping your point and you’re blatantly ignoring that our society values thinness at all costs. Even what people call “thick” now are still girls with flat stomachs and some ass/legs. 

You can also be unhealthy at a “healthy weight” and healthy at an “unhealthy weight”. Body size /= health, but that’s a whole different discussion that goes into why the BMI scale is a sham."
MtvChallenge,fp26yjd,t1_fp25tz3,1588256383.0,"Lmaooo trust me I’m not assuming anything of the such and I never said anything of the sort. 

But I do know that people who look like Kailah or even don’t, can read your words and take it in a harmful way. “Well if Kailah’s not considered thin, what am I?” Or even consider Kailah reading that and seeing the comparison between her and the other female challengers. 

You can’t deny that society values thinness over other body types, that’s why people literally kill themselves to be thin. You have to consider how people will interpret your words and comparisons. You could’ve easily said “she’s around Kailah’s size”. You decided to add the words thick and skinny and throw in comparisons. That’s the harmful part."
MtvChallenge,fp24jnj,t1_fp22e1v,1588254998.0,"Again, she has muscles and is taller than some other girls, but again, she’s skinny. 

Your original post doesn’t clarify you’re only comparing her to other Challenge cast members. Saying she’s not skinny is just wrong and again, playing off unrealistic body standards. Frankly perpetuating harmful rhetoric as well."
MtvChallenge,fp21h4n,t3_gaub6y,1588253135.0,"What? Kailah not skinny??? You can see her rib cage in like half of her bathing suit shots... 

Sure she has muscles, but Kailah is a fairly thin woman. This is why people have such body dysmorphia."
SubredditDrama,fp1wz6f,t3_gatj9k,1588250096.0,A decent quality of life always seems to be missing from what they say are “necessities”. Almost as if they think being poor is a moral failure so poor people don’t deserve to live a decent life.
SkincareAddiction,fp0q4y8,t3_gam7pl,1588214472.0,You need to focus on hydrating your skin because hydrated skin produces less oils. Also I’d ditch the glycolic toner for a BHA.
Eyebleach,fozd270,t3_gaeazn,1588188626.0,Incredible.
SkincareAddiction,foxzin2,t3_ga7a82,1588161335.0,"Unfortunately there’s really not much that can be done for stretch marks as they are scars. 

Bodies change, that’s perfectly normal. Stretch marks are perfectly normal. Even angry red ones. No amount of skin care will help separate your body image from your insecurities. That’s deeper, therapeutic work."
MtvChallenge,foltgbg,t3_g85lv5,1587870076.0,Bear has something similar so I figured it was just a trend. A rather...interesting trend at that.
MtvChallenge,foforui,t1_foflxk2,1587740124.0,Imagine stanning that Jay 🥴🤢
TaylorSwift,fodzwbt,t1_fodw6ef,1587693307.0,"How can we not expect her to be emotional when these are quite literally her life’s work for the past 15+ years? 

Also why is that a bad thing? Feeling emotion is healthy. Having emotional attachment to personal work is not a bad thing. Sometimes there are things more important than business or the bottom line."
MtvChallenge,focjpig,t1_foce0ch,1587672130.0,"He was such a dick. It’s honestly gross to watch. And that’s not to say he wasn’t just as much of a dick in his early Challenge days, but at least he had his competition and game play skills to offset it. 

I just find strategic/conniving Wes more entertaining than drunk/“groupie drawer” Wes."
TaylorSwift,foce1sv,t3_g6rwfx,1587670224.0,"She made me like country music! Back when her debut album came out, I was in middle school and hated country, but i fell in love with Taylor when my neighbors showed her to me. Since then I’ve been a devoted country fan, even after she transitioned to pop."
MtvChallenge,fobrjvt,t3_g6p1lq,1587662895.0,"Wes for sure. Don’t get me wrong, he was entertaining on his RW season, but he didn’t start to grow on me until I saw him on The Challenge."
SkincareAddiction,foaktp9,t3_g6lz7y,1587648337.0,"I used to use the peeking solution, but tbh I have other masks with AHAs in them that I preferred. Since I only use them once a week, I found myself not using the peeling  solution fast enough and had to throw it out. 

The glycolic toner is more for day/every other day use. If you use the glycolic toner though you should stop using the lactic acid and the glycolic fix toner. Because they all have roughly the same function."
