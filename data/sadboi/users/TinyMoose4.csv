FinancialCareers,fphr8lf,t1_fpho2kn,1588626335.0,If your office relatively small or a large corporation? I just don’t know how they’ll reopen since we have an open floor plan with so many desks put together. Our cafeteria is also completely full during lunchtime
travel,fpgldje,t1_fpg4ag5,1588604960.0,Hey I understand how it feels. I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my bf for the past four years with three years being US to London. Luckily we’re much closer now but we only saw each other twice a year for those three years and once was always in July because of our summer breaks. I’d say to wait it out and see because I have a feeling things might get a bit better by then. I think France is somewhat opening a bit starting this month? I’m not sure where I read about it though but I’d do some research. Solidarity with you :)
NorthCarolina,fpgem5b,t3_gb45sv,1588601122.0,"Hey Jeff, thank you for the updates. Please please try to have the NC government encourage remote working for offices statewide throughout Phase 2 and possibly throughout the summer as well. It’s so important that companies that have the ability to have staff WFH continue to do so the economy can somewhat reopen for those who cannot."
CoronavirusUS,fp28aij,t1_fox5gy0,1588257119.0,What state are you in? Hopefully my office (large financial company) does the same
Anxiety,for3buc,t3_g8v0l8,1588005459.0,I feel the exact same way! I’m living at home with my parents right now since I can wfh but I’m dreading about having to go back to my apartment which is closer to my office because I have a horrible roommate and just being there makes me anxious. Hopefully my office (and most offices) will allow employees to keep working from home throughout the summer like Facebook is doing!
raleigh,fon4l48,t1_fon4fcq,1587912095.0,"They handled it very quickly and efficiently. They started with a rotating group A/B schedule but after realizing how dire the situation was getting, they quickly made everyone WFH by March 13th"
NorthCarolina,foeaxzm,t3_g6sqnj,1587699621.0,So where do corporate offices fall under the phases? I saw encourage teleworking under Phase 1 but not 2 or 3
NorthCarolina,fod6hat,t1_fod340j,1587680727.0,The PowerPoint that they presented today at the press conference said “encourage continued teleworking” under Phase 1 so I’m guessing corporate offices will keep encouraging WFH until end of may at least. The phase 2 slide didn’t say anything about teleworking but I sure hope offices continue to push WFH throughout the 4-6 weeks we’re in phase 2
NorthCarolina,fod4uzv,t1_fod3nhp,1587679897.0,Yeah but it says teleworking will be encouraged under phase 1 so I don’t think they’ll open
NorthCarolina,focwtgw,t3_g6uzts,1587676919.0,Where do reopening offices come into this? The PowerPoint said Phase 1 would encourage teleworking but the slides on Phase 2 and 3 didn’t say anything about teleworking.

Landlord,fmrbwi2,t1_fmrbly2,1586318878.0,"Thanks! Yes I think that’s what my landlord does as well. They check if the remaining roommate makes enough and if they don’t - well tough luck to them. I just emailed my landlord yesterday and they said if something like this happens, I would not be evicted since they no longer consider me part of the lease since I have given my termination notice and vacated after it expires. I’m just overly paranoid so wanted to get my bases covered."

Anxiety,fmqxy2e,t1_fmqwxby,1586309478.0,No pets but there’s another version of this spray called Bifen IT which *might* be better if you have pets and kids. I would suggest you read up on it though to make sure it is safe. Hope it helps!
Anxiety,fmqlssk,t3_fwsmm0,1586302139.0,Omg no advice but I feel this exact same way but for ants instead of cockroaches. I just wanted to give you solidarity. I moved into an apartment august 2019 and found a couple cockroaches when I moved in. Since then I’ve only seen a couple barely living ones but it freaks me out still. Another thing I’ve seen are ants on my windowsill. I first found them around mid November but every time I go back to my apartment I’m absolutely afraid and stressed. To the point where it took up approximately 60% of my mind space on sundays. Luckily my parents live 1.5 hours away so I go there every weekend but I cannot wait until my lease ends early August and I get out of that place. It absolutely freaks me out especially since I had ants in my last apartment too. I’m afraid that there are gonna be a trail of ants on my window and in my room. One thing I’ve found that works really well is this thing called Bifen XTS. You can find it on amazon and it’s this super strong bug spray that you have to dilute in water. My dad made the spray in December and I didn’t see another ant until late February. I might have to spray again come late may or June but by then I’ll only have two months left of my lease so I’ll deal with it. Anyway hope this helps!
NorthCarolina,fmgciqm,t1_fmgan5m,1586045988.0,Honestly congrats that happened to you. I’m hoping to hear back from my leasing office on Monday so Hopefully i am not on the hook if I’ve provided the notice and vacated
NorthCarolina,fmgc3ue,t1_fmgbuyw,1586045729.0,Would the landlord keep cashing checks even if I have provided a notice of termination? And what do you think - would the landlord begin eviction for both of us or just her since she’s the one who isn’t vacating?
NorthCarolina,fmg8npy,t1_fmg7bzz,1586043605.0,I also don’t care about the deposit since it’s all my former roommate’s and not mine who moved out and let this POS replace her.
NorthCarolina,fmg8k3v,t1_fmg7bzz,1586043540.0,"Holy shit that’s exactly what I’m afraid of happening. I’ve consulted with a lawyer on Avvo who said if I give the proper notice it is up to the remaining roommate and landlord and if they need to get evicted it would only be on them. I also contacted one of my dad’s friends who is a real estate agent but they also said the same thing - that I wouldn’t be on the hook since the notice of termination counts for both and I did my part and vacated. But I keep receiving conflicting answers so I just emailed my leasing company to see what they say just in case. 

I am also moving in with my boyfriend in August so I really don’t want to deal with this shit. We’ve been long distance for four years now and don’t want to be held liable for something like this. If you don’t mind me asking what ended up happening in your situation? Did the roommate end up vacating?"
legaladvice,fmfv645,t1_fmfh04f,1586035505.0,Hi sorry one more question - is there any chance the roommate staying would trigger the month to month renewal? Or since I’ve given the notice of termination that would not be an issue and she would be considered a holdover tenant anyway?
Landlord,fmfnrjh,t1_fmfn7tg,1586031125.0,"So you’re saying from a legal standpoint, the landlord would file against both of us but they can also choose not to include me in the filing if I’ve done my part? Also Is there any chance the roommate staying would trigger the month to month renewal or is that only if I haven’t given the notice?"
legaladvice,fmfgv4e,t1_fmfgd58,1586026969.0,Okay understood. Thank you!
legaladvice,fmfcllz,t1_fmfc6n8,1586024440.0,"See that’s what I’m confused about. I actually did contact an attorney on Avvo and they said if I’ve properly given a notice and the roommate does not vacate, it is 100% between her and the landlord and not me. He also said our deposit might get held up (which I dont care about) and the landlord might evict her but it won’t be on me. So I’m not sure why I get different answers"
NorthCarolina,fmfc4tk,t1_fmfbzad,1586024163.0,Thank you!
legaladvice,fmfbh8b,t1_fmfb60w,1586023778.0,"Okay so if I’m understanding correctly, you mean to say that I would still be on the hook and an eviction can go on my record if the roommate doesn’t vacate once the lease ends?"
legaladvice,fmfakf7,t1_fkinz83,1586023238.0,Hi do you mind if you can clarify what you mean when you say NC law does not consider  one tenant’s termination a severance from the lease since that is clearly what the lease says in what I posted?
NorthCarolina,fmf3dp7,t1_fmdcyz9,1586019123.0,"Thanks so I’m guessing if my roommate doesn’t budge even though I have provided the notice and vacated, it is between her and the landlord and not me since I am no longer bound by the terms of the lease?"
NorthCarolina,fmdblit,t1_fmdbg7x,1585963797.0,Thanks and if they refuse to vacate our current apartment - it is between them and the landlord? If I vacate and provide a notice of termination on behalf of both of us - I am released from the lease completely?
legaladvice,fmd9kbf,t1_fmd90bk,1585962427.0,Gotcha. Thanks anyway. I just wanna be released from the lease so as long as that happens whatever honestly
legaladvice,fmd8xol,t1_fmd8s2y,1585962012.0,Okay thanks. And will the eviction action just be against the remaining roommate? Or both of us? Even if I have vacated all my belongings and myself?
legaladvice,fmd8ie2,t1_fmd7xph,1585961731.0,"This part: 

**34. YOUR DUTIES UPON TERMINATION:** Upon any termination of Your tenancy and/or the Agreement, whether for default or otherwise, You shall, in addition to any other obligations required by this Agreement perform ALL of the following:

**B. Vacate the Home.** You shall vacate the Home and remove all personal property from the Home and from the community in which the Home is located.  
   
 It doesn't say in the lease what will happen if one of us doesn't vacate. I've contacted a lawyer on Avvo who said it's between the remaining roommate and the landlord but I just want to be 100% sure. I'm guessing our landlord will just go after my roommate if I've already left."

raleigh,fm7sij3,t1_fm7mljw,1585835826.0,Yeah hopefully that is the case. I don’t get why some companies are still so hesitant to let employees WFH and I hope this is a wakening call
raleigh,fm0kh0e,t1_flzh9pi,1585660167.0,See my above edits on my post. I posted this because I actually don’t want to go back to the office and really enjoy WFH. I wanted to get other people’s opinions and estimates to see what they think.

So far, I've been working from home since 3/12 and am work-from-home until further notice. I don't mind it as I am at my parents' house and love it here but I am just curious.

Landlord,fkkikb0,t1_fkkhtrl,1584284829.0,"Right. I was just worried because the lease states that it goes month to month automatically once lease ends and if no party gives termination. But I do plan on giving the termination, I’m just confused as to what will happen if my roommate doesn’t vacate"

I luckily only live with 1 other person but I will be so happy and anxiety-free once our lease ends in 6 months. My roommate has people over every day, keeps the kitchen so gross, and is always home. Because of all this, I also go to my parents house every weekend. I spend 4 nights a week there for the proximity to work but I am so happy every Friday when I get to go to my parents. I tried to find a subleaser but it was soo so hard to find someone and when someone finally applied, my dumbass leasing office didn’t approve them so now I’m pretty much stuck in this lease until beginning of August.

My roommate is alright and I don’t have too many complaints but I totally get the bringing people over almost everyday and them not telling you. My roommate brings friends over almost everyday and it’s so fkn annoying because I’m stuck with the non private bathroom so I feel like I have to be “on” every time I need to pee or go into the kitchen. Not to mention some of these friends are random guys who ogle at me so it makes me uncomfortable. Other than that shes also super wasteful. She turns the dishwasher on almost every other day even when it’s not full and our water bill has increased by like $20 ever since she moved in so it’s so annoying. She also produces SO MUCH TRASH for one person. Idk how. We have to put it out almost every day too. She also works from home so she’s always there and I never feel like I have the place to my self. Other than that she’s fine But I get it
badroommates,fgnnuc2,t1_fgnn8s8,1580948959.0,Chances are they won’t be! My roommate isn’t the worst roommate ever but I’d rather not live with her you know.

They said they worked from 3pm-12am and since I work a 9-5 I thought that was perfect. I’d feel like I have the whole place to myself. I was dead wrong - idk what happened but they don’t work those hours anymore apparently and they’re ALWAYS in the apartment. She has someone over almost everyday, including random guys who ogle at me, the kitchen has crumbs all over the floor, she talks loudly on FaceTime everyday in the living room, and she runs the dishwasher almost every other day, making our water bill run sky high. I wish I knew and met with them first and I regret not doing that. Now I’m stuck with them for 6 months.
