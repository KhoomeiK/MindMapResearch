How they had very few outfits because of their small living spaces but the outfits they did have were quite nice. Wish I remembered where I'd read it, it was an interesting read.

It's funny because growing up, I was envious of my favorite cartoon characters--they wore the same exact outfit every single day and nobody thought anything of it because everybody else did it too. These past few years, I've taken to finding a particular brand/style of pants or shirt or whatever that I like and buying multiples of the same exact thing because I'm quite picky when it comes to clothes. But even still I feel susceptible to advertisements. And I know I have something of a shopping addiction. Retail therapy. I'm always finding reasons to need new clothes. Like right now, I ""need"" new sleep shorts because it's going to be summer soon and my old sleep shorts are slightly uncomfortable because they're a little bit tight in the waist. (Which, oof. That's never a fun discovery.) There's something about buying the solution to a problem that brings me 5 minutes of happiness, even though I know it's fleeting. Even though I know I'll never be ""done""--if I just buy x, y and z, my wardrobe will be complete and I can stop! At least until I have to replace something... Because it does take a lot of time and effort and money, buying things I thought I liked only to discover I didn't after 1-2 wears...

As for the higher quality, ethically produced clothing, I've been trying. It's a slow undertaking since I'm a low income earner and I grew up with a mom who never bought anything that wasn't on sale, but I've been able to find a few things. I've finally realized I can't stand those shitty $9 t-shirts, I'm getting a lot more enjoyment and mileage out of my $30-40 ones (though I doubt how ethical those actually are). But I still haven't gotten more expensive pants. The sticker shock on those $100+ jeans is hard to get passed. But if they're anything like the t-shirts...

I don't know. Sorry, that was a really long rant! But I agree, we'd all be better off with less clothes that are better quality, the people making them and wearing them."

They can help you narrow down what you want to do, or open up your eyes to the possibilities of certain majors.

I can understand feeling this way, I took a LOA at the beginning of the month and I've been struggling with the guilt of bailing on my department ever since, but look at how you phrased this. ""need to."" Not want to. You know your own limits, and you essentially are risking your own life every time you go into work.
I also had high hopes for Kroger stores to go to Clicklist-only, thinking that would solve a lot of our problems with enforcing social distancing and I'm disheartened to hear that it's not going well in other aspects.

> i dont feel like an important asset to the company anymore. i hardly even feel human these days, let alone important.

This really spoke to me. I thought being considered an essential employee or a ""hero"" would finally make me feel important but all it did was make me feel trapped. We are all just cogs in the machine and we are all replaceable. Regardless of whatever you decide to do, your well-being (physical or mental) is worth taking into consideration."
