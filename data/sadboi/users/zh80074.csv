AskReddit,fpxln6b,t3_gfsi0q,1588984909.0,Honestly I'm not sure if this was a dream or a vision. I was very young I'm not sure what age (I know this sounds like a cliche creepypasta so far but I'm telling the truth) so basically I wake up and walk out the door of my room and into the upstairs hallway. There was like a light blue haze everywhere. Think fog but sky blue. And there were like tendrils or whatever on the wall. Like stranger things. I'm trying to compare what I saw to common things so you can understand. I'm starting to walk down the stairs and halfway down I peek into the living room. There are tendrils/vines and that blue haze everywhere and the floor and walls are cracked and chunks are broken off and are sort of floating. The living room floor is no longer there it's just a gaping hole into a blue void.  Somehow the coffee table and furniture are still intact and floating above the void and my dad and a couple other guys in suits are sitting around the coffee table doing business. They're completely oblivious to the chaos that surrounds them. I call out but they cant hear or see me. I cant hear what they're saying. There isn't any sound. The entire place in dead silent. Then that's where the dream/vision ends. It was super surreal and I still remember it.
