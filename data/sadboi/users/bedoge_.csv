Then she felt asleep cause it was pretty late, but I'm grateful for those conversations and it's just beautiful how people grow when you just let them. So happy for u!"
LifeProTips,fp2b0sj,t1_fp27kqq,1588258579.0,"yup, it's more like u choose to be offended (it sounds pretty dumb but it's how I see it).

I'm trying to give her everything that I'd like to get. 

we told ourselves that we believe in our good intentions, always and if somebody got hurt you have to tell each other that, because other person may not know that and if it's intentional it's just not healthy.

I have to add that me and my SO were both working hard on ourselves to be as much self conscious about our behavior and I sometimes say stuff ""if I do X it means I feel Y""."
LifeProTips,fp1slwn,t3_gark7s,1588246567.0,"In my relationship we always make a comfort zone for each other. We never had an argument like yelling or something. I think it's funny that I with my SO has made something like a speed crash course how to be in relationship and what do we want from each other.

With my ex I was to scared to get into an argument, because she was using what I said and was turning it backwards, being harsh on me and publicly shaming me. There was no conversation just yelling and I had to back off cause it was devastating for me.

I just love how u can have your comfort zone with somebody and yes it's awkward, yes I'm scared but just a thought that we can talk about everything and we will try to work it out is amazing."

I was kinda scared because everyone was complaining about the camera but for real it's pretty great, and sometimes I can get better pictures than my dad's Huawei p20 pro.

The thing that keeps it all going I think is trust in each other (I have massive trust issues but I'm trying). I keep in mind that she loves me and cares for me and I want her to keep that too (lately she told me, that she knows that I love her and she can feel it, which made me glad).
