mentalhealth,erz2qjq,t3_c4nr33,1561424118.0,"Me too. It sucks when everytime they're in a dark place, i try my hardest to be with them because i know how it feels and certainly you don't want to be alone. It's not that i ask for their help because i helped them. It just that.. them ignoring me having worsen mental health just kinda add fuel to the fire. I've been more suicidal lately. Probably because the fact that my friends, families, they seem to be well without me. And the fact that i've been dropping hints of me being suicidal but no one cared enough to ask (bruh, my hints are like super obvious, i'm embarassed to say this but yeah..). In the past i tried directly open up to them. But the feedbacks were mostly them changing the conversation, saying that i was too dark/bring negativity. So yeah, they avoided the conversation. That's why i thought maybe a subtle approach might made them want to help/at least hear me. But, nope. They decided to ignore it. I'm super sad because i know i love them, but i don't think they love me back. All they see is negativity in me. While everytime they're in a downhill i try to absorb their negativity. Thus now i decide to just not open up at all. I just pretend that i'm better, my mental health, my life, my everything.

I'm sorry that you're feeling lonely. I hope your friends can finally see how much they mean to you. I'm also sorry i can't give you any advice/solution as i am on the same boat with you. But let's just hope it gets better

Sorry if there is any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language and also i'm on mobile so.."
