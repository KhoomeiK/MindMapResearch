Stay the hell off the news
     -NO I'm just going to check real quick
     -NO let me see what the numbers look like
     -NO peeking at CNN
     -NO ""I'm just trying to stay informed"" 
     -NO Twitter
     -Minimal Reddit (esp THOSE subreddits)
     -Minimal to NO Facebook
     -Personally I only stay in up to speed with my local  governors press conferences

Find something to do
     -Clean the house, break it down room by room, set goals, whatever 
     -work on hobby work, build that model, bake that cake, mount those pictures, organize your Adobe Lightroom, beat that boss in Final Fantasy WHATEVER

Get some exercise 
     -obviously in accordance with local rules, most places you are allowed to get out of the house. Take a walk, do 10 laps around the block, walk the dog, go for a jog, get sun and fresh air, obviously do not congregate and plop down in a group of 30 to hang out for hours. Wash your hands when you get home. 

Do stuff that makes you feel good
     -Check on a friend or relative especially someone older or in another at risk group. Do they need groceries, a medicine run, or just someone to talk to?
     -Order takeout from your favorite local joint that may be struggling during Social Distacing. All the support helps.
