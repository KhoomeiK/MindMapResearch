LifeAfterNarcissism,ffouwh9,t1_ffe29y0,1580082054.0,"Thank you so much for your reply. 

Man I do wish so much I had that kind of fire. My nmother always told me to aim low. I’ve very good at cooking and cleaning and other manual labor. She had me clean the house when I was little because she said the only thing I was going to be able to do is clean up after others. She would watch me clean the toilets and remind me that it’s all I was going to clean shit my whole life. 

At first as a child it upset me to think that I was some how lower because I had a learning disability. I lacked motivation in school and was a late bloomer. I couldn’t even read until I was 9. I guess I accepted that as my reality eventually: disabled, useless, wrong, my fault. 

Aiming low is my comfort and there’s nothing I can do to change my mind it seems. So many people tell me I can snap out of it, but I can’t. I take minimum wage jobs because I can’t pull myself together enough to set out to find a career. I know that I crush under any pressure and that no career would allow that. Might fight is gone, or maybe it was never there. When I hear people say they’re doing it to prove others wrong I get almost envious- I wish I had that. The fight. It’s just not in me, I don’t have it. I break down- that’s it. It’s really just not in my blood. I need *constant* encouragement and support to do anything and that’s just not how life works."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ffot20s,t1_ffdnplz,1580081386.0,"That’s amazing. I feel like I missed the bus on that- I didn’t get away for that toxic environment until my late twenties. Now I feel like it’s a race to catch up. 

I also feel like LC or VLC is almost harder than NC because you have to find that balance. I’m the same way. I did find a way to get out but I’m still not functional. But being away does clear my head. Unfortunately I do feel like once that “survival” mode stops because you leave that environment, it leaves a lot of clean-up to be done. I guess I’m still in that clean-up phase and I don’t know if I’m even close to doing it right. Especially since I don’t feel at all like I’ve improved since the day I left."

Mine is to finish my website, refine my portfolio, and take up yoga. So far I have done almost 0% to meet those goals."

Getting to the right doctors is a really big pain for someone who also has a hard time just getting out of bed, but I am trying. Thank you again"
LifeAfterNarcissism,ffone2q,t1_ffclis5,1580079523.0,"I am the same exact way. I’m really trying to better myself. I am actually taking *some* free classes at the local CC. I used to work out at the gym too, I even have a membership to the local gym but I cannot get myself to go. Right now I’m introducing myself to yoga on my own. 

Unfortunately to the people around me this isn’t enough. My partner is pretty much done with my failing. I’m almost 32, we’ve been together a long time. The thought that they might leave me makes me so depressed and scared. I always feel like I have to do more, and what I do is never enough. I get it from their perspective because it’s been 3 years and I still haven’t really done much to find work. I’ve had small jobs but ultimately end up quitting because of the stress. Everyone around me asks what I do and I have nothing to reply with. It sucks coming from a family of engineers and doctors and dating someone that comes from the same kind of family.

I remember my 4 year old self crying and crying saying it was my fault because I left the window ajar. I remember this woman looking at me and saying “No, this isn’t your fault at all. It’s no ones fault. Things like this just happen.”

It was probably one of the only times an adult in my life up until that point didn’t blame me, and it’s probably why it sticks out so much in my mind.

Respecting yourself is also very important. If you feel your partner is taking you for granted and there is no reasonable explanation or solution, then you need to assess if things can be fixed with constructive communication.

Anxiety,f5e24wt,t3_dnehjv,1572163504.0,"Knowing how to cope with anxiety is healthy and sets a good example for your children. You don’t have to let it all out, but you don’t have to hide it either. It sounds like there’s a lot on your plate. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or confide in friends. If that isn’t an option, consider seeking therapy. There is nothing wrong with anything your feeling. You don’t have to be big and strong all the time."
Petloss,f5ds8tf,t1_f5b6afh,1572158728.0,"I’m so sorry- I hope you will be able to find her so you can give her the send off she deserves. 

It sounds a little weird but, I have a little shrine to my late friend and I have a picture of her with some little whiskers I found and her favorite toy. I light incense for her and I put fresh cat treats by her photo every once in a while. I’m not a religious person, but this really helps me keep her memory there in my heart. If you can’t find your kitty, maybe something like this could suffice. It’s just a suggestion though, it’s not for everyone- I get that. 

Good luck friend"

Kitty I’m sorry"
Petloss,f57dyb3,t3_dmk847,1572034786.0,"Yes, you’re not alone. I’ve felt that way for the last two years. Once my kitty passed away, I realized what a irreplaceable friend I had. She was a cog in the machine that made me run, now she’s gone and I struggle... some days more than others. 

It’s not to worry you though, everyone grieves at their own pace. From what I’ve learned about death and grief is that it’s seldom tidy or simple. Its big, it’s loud, it’s complex, it hurts, and it’s messy. Even if One doesn’t show it to everyone on their sleeve. It’s totally normal, and it’s okay. Give yourself time. 

If you don’t think your therapist is taking you seriously, it just might be a sign you’re not a good fit. My therapist knew how important my cat was before she passed, that was a good fit. I would hope the same thing for you. Seeking out another therapist is fine, this one could even see if they can refer you if you like. I think seeking a professional out that specializes in things you want to work on is best. Whether that be grief, depression/anxiety, trauma; you can look those kind of things up before you make an appointment. 

I’m so sorry for your loss. Please be kind to yourself and give yourself time. Don’t be impatient and let those feelings pass through you when you feel them. It’s okay, and natural. Eat well, try to sleep on a normal schedule if not give yourself even more time to rest, get up at a normal time and try to have a goal for the day that you can accomplish. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when things get a little too much. If you need to reach out and work through things, the people here on r/petloss listen. We’ve all been there and we get it. You are not alone."
Petloss,f55dnsa,t3_dmpaug,1572005490.0,"I won’t try to fill you with false hope. Sometimes you just know, I respect that intuition, but maybe leave a couple cat treats and some of her favorite kitty food out for the next couple nights.... just in case. 

I’m so sorry this happened. So suddenly too. 

It’s been proven that while cats don’t require the same bonds as humans do, they do feel empathy affection, and friendship in a very similar way. Your kitty was loved, felt loved, and she loved you back just as much. That’s a very special thing- and you two were lucky to have met each other in this life time. 

Don’t forget to be kind to yourself. Eat and rest. Let us know if anything changes with the search."

I hope that you not only learn to enjoy life, but enjoy being on your own too. Being alone/single/not totally tied down is so freeing.

Just, appreciate the time you have with your animal friends while you can. One day you won’t have each other, so take time to spend with your pet and make their lives as rich as possible. In return they will enrich your days as well. 

Hermit crabs live about 30 years, so you should have plenty of time. Maybe do some more research on what they require to be happy. Good luck"
