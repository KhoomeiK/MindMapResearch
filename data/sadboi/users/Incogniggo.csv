At myrtle beach, at night time. We all smoked a joint each (3), get high asf. It gets cold, for some reason we have no footwear on. On the walk back, the sand looked like snow to us, and then slowly began to feel like snow to us...

We pick up the pace, until it ends in a full on sprint. Oblivious to anyone around us, we sprint a good quarter mile. Friend 1 zoomed past me and Friend 2 and I decided to pick up the pace. Then Friend 1 and J were neck and neck but then I start slowing down.

I eventually fall to the ground, and do the Crawl Anakin did when he was in lava and lost to Obi-wan. In pain cause the sand (snow in my head) was so cold....
And then someone said the hotel was right there, so I got right up casually walk there. And eat some bomb ass spaghetti and meatballs that my friend‚Äôs dad made for us."
