BabyBumps,fmsrt4w,t3_fx583p,1586360985.0,Dear God thank you for posting this. I have nothing right now and people are pressuring me. I'm only 6 1/2 months!!!
BabyBumps,flavpdd,t3_fkvicl,1584992073.0,"I am in exactly the same spot as you. I originally was supposed to have my shower mid-May, but I’m due in July and changed my date to mid-June, which is the latest I feel comfortable having it. I really don’t know what to do if I have to cancel since I’ve bought nothing and really was depending on having a shower. 

My plan right now is to assess the situation in a few weeks and send out invites if things look a little bit hopeful, with a note that says we are monitoring the COVID-19 crisis and the date is tentative, and we will send an update if we need to cancel. Keep us in the loop about what to do."
HealthAnxiety,fkryz6a,t1_fklkd1c,1584478844.0,"I’ve regret every time I’ve gone out in public for the past week. But then again, every day that passes by where I don’t have symptoms is a success! Just gotta keep counting down the days."

HealthAnxiety,fkryjcp,t1_fkokf2e,1584478595.0,"Yes. At least once a day I think I’m running a fever. Honestly the best thing I did was stop taking my temperature if I’m unsure, because i figured it doesn’t matter anyway. Where I am, they’re telling you to just stay home if you have mild symptoms and haven’t been in contact with confirmed cases. So it’s like - I’ll worry when I have legit symptoms."
Anxiety,fkrvjpo,t3_fk4iag,1584476888.0,"I think of things this way. Every day I don’t get sick, or my loved ones don’t get sick, is a victory. If we can make it to 2 weeks after social distancing and self-isolating where no one feels sick, that’s a huge win. Just take it one day at a time. The days will start adding up and you’ll feel more hopeful."
HealthAnxiety,fkll1if,t1_fkgss95,1584308836.0,I also have been feeling hot and flushed a few times a day.

HealthAnxiety,fhfyamx,t1_fh992cr,1581554197.0,"So it’s pretty much gone. I don’t know if it was all in my head and going to therapy helped, or if I actually had an issue. I seriously didn’t think this was going to happen and I was dying. I hope that gives you hope."

HealthAnxiety,fd6geiy,t1_fd4fyjo,1578190600.0,"So I never wound up going to the doctor because I was too nervous but also didn’t want to waste their time (my usual reasons). I was experiencing slight chest pain and tightness on my right side. I also had a dry cough that wasn’t really something uncontrollable, but was more so a “testing” cough. I would cough because I felt my right lung rattle, and I would cough until it hurts. 

So, I had off from work for the holidays, and suddenly my tightness was gone. But I was still coughing. Then I got actually sick (a cold). When I was sick and as I got better, I noticed my cough was gone, besides clearing my throat of mucus from my cold. My cough is still pretty much gone.

I’m still not 100% reassured but my anxiety about this has gone from an 8 or 9 to like a 2 or 3. I was seriously convinced of this for WEEKS and this series of events just showed me how much of it was probably just completely in my head. I’m still on the alert of checking to see if my symptoms come back or get worse, but right now I’m feeling good."
HealthAnxiety,fcvqcfz,t3_eixqj5,1578007715.0,I found that I can't go to the bathroom without bringing my phone. Gross but I disinfect my phone regularly and never touch it in between um going and washing my hands. I feel like I need it there in case something happens and I'm on the verge of passing out or something - so that I can text my husband to come get me in the bathroom so I'm not found there dead hours later.
HealthAnxiety,fcqfsro,t1_fcow44h,1577885190.0,I feel exactly the same way. We are all here fighting the same battle! I want to enjoy 2020 without thinking I’m going to die.

CautiousBB,fcof83k,t3_ei5lf7,1577830791.0,"I had very few, and very mild symptoms. I also would get so worried because my friends and posts I would read online would say how they feel so terrible they have to take time off work (like you), or just in the bathroom puking up everything, and I just didn't experience that. Had my first appointment and everything looked perfect. I'm almost 12 weeks now and just happy I've had a pretty mild 1st trimester."
HealthAnxiety,fcoeyd5,t3_ei4dto,1577830604.0,How did you work on ignoring your symptoms?
HealthAnxiety,fblz8kc,t3_edv4d5,1576974156.0,"Are you me?? Also a nonsmoker, also worried about my right lung for weeks now, also just cancelled a doctors appointment. I don’t have much for you except that I understand exactly where you’re coming from. Sometimes doing things like going for a run help me because I’m like “okay if I can do this without being short of breath then I probably don’t have lung cancer.” Also the tightness decreases significantly because I feel like the exercise helps me relax. I would try it. Feel free to DM me anytime if you need to talk."
HealthAnxiety,fblv6dq,t1_fbhoxm1,1576971127.0,I can’t believe you’ve had a cough for 4 years. Thanks for the encouragement

CautiousBB,fa5juft,t1_fa5e28f,1575815693.0,Really? I read on another thread that your hormones peak around weeks 9-10 so that’s when your symptoms are the worst? I guess that’s why I’m asking. Also my friend who is pregnant right now told me that she started feeling really nauseous around week 7 and then progressively got a lot worse.

TryingForABaby,f73icsb,t1_f6zonug,1573391826.0,"I guess what I mean is, I’ve been tracking CM and BBT since before TTC, and read Taking Charge of Your Fertility. The general rule of thumb there is to have sex when you have EWCM, which we did. However, we would stop when it started to “dry up,” and then there would be about 2 days between my EWCM and ovulation. I thought just by BDing on days where there was mucus, I covered all my bases. It wasn’t until I used OPKs where it pretty much told me to have sex AFTER EWCM that we tried that."

TryingForABaby,f6wqeal,t3_dqyzs0,1573232494.0,"**Cycle:** 4

**Age + Partner's age (if relevant):** 32 (me) and 38 (husband)

**Typical cycle length:** 27 days

**Ovulation cycle day:** 16

**CD/DPO of positive test(s):** CD28/DPO12, CD29/DPO13, CD30/DPO14

**Tracking methods and app(s) used:** Kindara for BBT charts

**Relevant days of sperminating and/or method (SMEP, TI, IUI, FET, etc.):** BDed on O-6, O-4, O-2, O-1

**Health conditions/medical tests:** Had a ruptured appendix/appendectomy when I was 14, also have had a lingering simple ovarian cyst for about 2 years now.

**Supplements and medications (yours and/or your partner’s):** Been taking prenatals from about 6 months before we started trying, so about 10 months now. Me: back and forth between Mama Bird Prenatals (one a day) and Actif Organics Prenatals, also Nordic Naturals Prenatal DHA and Nested Choline supplements. Husband: Nature Made Multi for Him + Omega 3s gummies. Both of us also took CoQ10 gummies. And... really random, but we both ate Brazil nuts every day because I read about how selenium could be beneficial for egg/sperm health, so I ate one a day with my vitamins, and my husband ate 2-3 a day for about 3 months (NO idea if this helped but we tried it as a ""meh couldn't hurt"" measure).

**Birth control history (if relevant):** Never on the pill.

**Link to chart:**  I don't know how to share that easily sorry!

**Symptom spotting:** The night before I tested I felt some light cramping, so I thought my period was definitely on its way. Also my anxiety always ramps up right before my period but I felt more ""normal.""

**Other (advice/tip(s), freaking out, miscellaneous):** Freaking out, happy, cautious but optimistic. I got overwhelmed really early and I'm so thankful for the people on this sub who reached out and I could connect with. I really thought, especially with my history of abdominal surgery/infection, that I would have a much harder time. So for anyone else who is a constant worrier/always expects the worst.... if you're reading this, my heart goes out to you but everything might just work out. My anxiety is still something I'm dealing with but I'm learning to be happy with every day that I know I'm pregnant and take it one step at a time.

Also REALLY recommend OPKs. I had charted my cycles for months and months before we even starting trying, and my cycles were almost textbook. I thought I was doing everything right but I wasn't BDing close enough to my O-day. That's what I think was different this cycle."

Have not been Googling but sometimes substitute that with Redditing, so I’m kind of torn on what to do. It helps me to read other peoples experiences but I don’t want to keep searching symptoms and illnesses on here. Trying to remind myself that if I DID find out I had a serious illness today, I would regret that I was scared and didn’t live life to the fullest! Reminding myself every day that I’m here, alive, healthy, and to take advantage of that. Journaling my thoughts. Going on walks. Breathing exercises.

It burst once a few years ago and then came back. But I’ve been having more and more issues with loose stools lately, so I guess I’m worried that they are connected. My gyno told me it looks clear and benign but I guess  I’m just worried that it’s not and that when it burst a few years ago it spread stuff to my bowels. I know that might not be likely but it’s just the concern I have now."
Ovariancancer,f3985mh,t1_f3945e9,1570744837.0,"Thanks, so I guess part of the reason why I was asking was to see if something that looks “simple” on an ultrasound had the potential to be malignant.

Yes, my gynecologist told me about the risks of cystectomy and why we should try to avoid it if possible. My mom wasn’t diagnosed with OC, I think you might have gotten that mixed up with the previous poster, but I appreciate your help and your input!"
Ovariancancer,f38ad3s,t1_f37q1ir,1570734821.0,Thank you for your help! Unfortunately I am very anxious so using my own judgment isn’t necessarily accurate if I’m freaked out lol. What symptoms did your mom experience? I will try to get a second opinion.
TFABLinePorn,f36vxy9,t3_dfwf4s,1570718290.0,"Wow! I have the same cheapie tests and got a negative test two days ago, but still no period. Maybe I should test again. Congrats!"
Ovariancancer,f36vlyw,t3_dff9cu,1570718177.0,"Hey, let me know how it goes with your ultrasound. I’m going through something similar and kind of freaked out :("
HealthAnxiety,f35yg8i,t3_dfsyan,1570697777.0,Your basal body temperature is usually elevated right before your period starts. Yes that’s okay! I’ve even had times where I swore I had a fever but then I got my period and it went away.
TryingForABaby,f34t5k0,t1_f2y7yw3,1570660085.0,Thank you. I’ve tried telling myself not to Google (or search on Reddit) but I just keep doing it :( I’m going to try journaling.
TryingForABaby,f34t2gn,t1_f2w7m5t,1570660027.0,"We are almost flair twins! Thanks, I feel a lot less alone."
OCD,f31hb53,t1_f317k0q,1570575445.0,Happy to hear!
TryingForABaby,f2v0ah2,t1_f2u903u,1570438815.0,From where I stand right now I can’t even fathom how brave you must be to start trying again. Hugs to you.
TryingForABaby,f2v08wx,t1_f2u7k93,1570438738.0,"The Googling is a huge problem. I know I shouldn’t do it but I do. Good to hear there are some TTC friendly options for meds. 

Yes I’ve designated my husband with that job too but I feel like such a burden sometimes :("
