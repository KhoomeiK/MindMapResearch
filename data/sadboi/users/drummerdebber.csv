birthcontrol,fr51l6l,t1_fr2wakd,1589900864.0,"I used to skip my period for a couple of years and then suddenly sex and orgasms became extremely painful that I would be doubled over, crying in pain. I had ultrasounds and tests done, but my doctor couldn’t figure out what was causing this. Then offhand one day she mentioned that she was wrong about me being able to skip my period indefinitely and that I should have a period at least twice a year. I started having a period every 3 months and the pain completely went away! Just thought I’d pass this along."
rheumatoid,fr512rt,t1_fr4zxvd,1589900597.0,"I’ve had JRA my whole life. I’m still not able to work full time due to pain from prior damage to my eyes and joints, and fatigue. I work part time as a photographer and am usually in crazy pain after a shoot. I am, however, able to walk up and down stairs, walk and sometimes run, write for short periods, and do regular activities unlike before, but still not as long as ‘normal’ people. 

For the most part the Cimzia has been doing a really good job keeping my flares under control. The relief I felt was like night and day. I went from barely being able to walk to being able to walk for long periods in a matter of months. The only thing it hasn’t been able to keep under control is my uveitis. I’ve lost a lot of my vision in one eye and had to have a couple of surgeries on it due to the high amount of prednisone I’ve had to use over prolonged periods. 

I’d recommend Cimzia for sure."
