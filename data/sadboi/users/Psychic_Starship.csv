I have a lot of mental illnesses and I take like over 9 different medications a day. My life is kinda in shambles. Bored a lot of the time. Would be cool to chat with someone similar.

I play some guitar and bass and have written a lot of songs. I'm pretty good at it, but haven't enjoyed it much lately. I'm also pretty good at repairing/modifying guitars. I play various video games. I listen to lots of music. I'm into a lot of different music, but usually I just reply, ""Rock n' Roll, 50s-70s"" when asked about that. I read a lot. I'm into existential philosophy. I smoke cigarettes and grass. My favorite old tv show is M\*A\*S\*H. I like putting on a silent movie, changing my tv's color settings so it looks funky, and listening to records while I trip. My favorite actor of all time is William Holden. Lawrence of Arabia might be my favorite movie. I went to college for 3 years, I'm well-read and well-educated.
