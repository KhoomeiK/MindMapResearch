bipolar,fmkgs32,t1_fmjmalh,1586154432.0,"My therapist recommended this to me and I just started reading it. She said in her opinion, this is THE best book resource about bipolar and talked pretty highly about it.

So far I really like it. The book is practical and gives tangible recommendations to create a personal wellness plan that will work for you.

Some of the recommendations don‚Äôt necessarily work for everyone, so you just have to be aware of that and only focus on ones that you think would work for you.

The book is empathetic, honest, and helpful; overall I would recommend it!

Edit: I forgot to mention this but I really like how this book is for family and friends too. On every few pages there are separate paragraphs with info specifically pertaining to loved ones. My SO even expressed interested in reading it after I‚Äôm finished."

I thought the questions were more difficult since I was used to the way they were worded in the learning system.  

Since I got a 70 on the post test and thought the actual exam questions were harder, I really didn‚Äôt think I was going to pass when I was taking the exam but somehow I did.  Don‚Äôt stress, you got this.  Good luck!"
