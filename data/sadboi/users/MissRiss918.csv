Nanny,fou91ht,t3_g9hr3i,1588079196.0,"I definitely understand! I know I am having a hard time with that too!!! Haha. We still do go to parks for long walks twice a week (weather permitting). I think the structure will help. This is a hard time, especially for littles who don’t understand what is going on. Implementing more structure helps with predictability for young kids. It takes some persistence in keeping a schedule, however, once the routine is in place the days go by so much smoother. This has also proven to be beneficial while NM and ND are home more frequently. My NKs know that after breakfast and cleanup it is “learning time,” and they even ask! Definitely feel like it has saved some headaches!"
Nanny,fou6xth,t3_g9hr3i,1588077780.0,"I plan my week as if I was still doing lesson plans in early childhood education settings. Our mornings look something like this:

7am- arrive, straighten up the home, and get kids ready as they wake (My NKs are 5yf, 3.75yf with Down Syndrome, and 2ym)

8am- prepare breakfast while kiddos watch a show and have independent play

8:30a- breakfast then clean up. Television is turned off before breakfast. Kiddos continue independent play while I clean up.

9a- “circle time”- I do ABCs, Shapes, Colors, and numbers with younger two.

9:15a- story time

9:45a- activity flash cards (with simple instructions that gets kiddos moving)

10a- physical activity of some sort

11a- prepare lunch, kiddos have independent play

11:45a- lunch

12:15p- clean up/kiddos choice (one show or any other activity)

12:45p- nap for younger two and complete kindergarten prep work with 5yf

2:30ish- kiddos up from nap

3p- snack

3:30p- art project

4p- free play for remainder of time I am there

This is a VERY flexible schedule. If they are having a day with limited attention, we change things up. Having a predictable schedule is beneficial for all of us. The kiddos know what to expect daily, as do I! If we are having trouble with listening ears or behavior, we implement a calm down corner. 

In terms of art projects- I have a “theme” for each week. This week we are talking about Community Helpers. Having a theme helps with coming up with simple art projects and helps facilitate learning conversations. I also look for library books related to our topic. To find simple art projects you can just enter your topic followed by “art projects for toddlers” into google! We do a ton of handprint and footprint art!

Finally, I follow a few people on Instagram that come up with AMAZING simple activities with children.  Busytoddler and dayswithgrey! Check them out.

Hopefully this helps! If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask! Good luck!"

EatingDisorders,fjf0s4i,t1_fjey4p1,1583281864.0,"This. I too feel like the ED will always be “a part” of me. I just no longer feel the ED is my identity. I’ve been in solid recovery (with a recent lapse) for the better part of 5 years. I still struggle with thoughts, and as mentioned I had a minor lapse, but I no longer give into those thoughts on the regular. 

Recovery gave me my life back. I was able to figure out who I am outside of food and size.

Good luck!"
Celiac,fjetfzl,t1_fje9gx9,1583277904.0,"Yeah, I have had all the bloodwork, but am needing to do the challenge in order to have an EGD and biopsy. My doctor who interpreted the bloodwork indicated that he definitely feels I have Celiac (plus it runs in the family) based of my numbers. I have to have a minimum of 3g per day, so I am trying to figure out what that means when translated to food.

I am definitely not looking forward to it, considering how my symptoms were prior to adhering to a strict gluten free diet. I am going to take a previous suggestion on looking forward to foods I’ve eliminated!"
eating_disorders,fiyrbfq,t3_fak57b,1582845201.0,"I don’t think there are any definitive answers. If you were to ask any doctor (who has knowledge of eating disorders) the answer would probably be based on how you feel, your mental health status, having normal results on bloodwork, and having regular menses. However, each individual is different, so depending on your health history, the aforementioned factors may be different. I don’t think there is a “one size fits all” in regards to weight. Also, the BMI is better known as the bullshit mass index. 

Hope this helps. I know sometimes fixating on a “perfect number” can create and perpetuate feelings of anxiety and depression. This then becomes a nasty cycle. I am trying my best to ditch the scale, because what is weight anyhow? Our body’s relationship with gravity? I would rather strive to feel good and be relatively healthy, and no number can dictate that."
EatingDisorders,fiwt6yl,t3_faa40r,1582801963.0,"I am so proud of you for the strength and courage you have! Posting an admission can be so challenging, especially when we are in denial or are fighting against our truths! I, too, just recently admitted to this sub that I was struggling again. It’s no easy feat!! 

However, what I can say is that it helped, it really did. Not only did I see immense support from this community, but also I gained the courage to “out” my behaviors to the people in my life who can help me reach a healthy place again. 

I have also struggled with my ED for a very long time, and it can easily sneak back in while we are unsuspecting. Thank you for telling us. Know that you are not alone. I wish you the best in trying to tackle this monster once again. Falling backwards is not a failure, it’s just a reminder that there is something that most likely needs attention in your life. Sending bundles of love!"
Nanny,fivwxwe,t3_f9xw0b,1582769916.0,"Normally, if I was in an office setting, or somewhere it is suggested to be “tolerant,” I found myself struggling. I am not religious, identify as bisexual, and have very strong political beliefs which are reflected in my morals and values. To say I could “agree to disagree” was a hell of a stretch and a compromise I was not willing to make in many settings. I appreciate being around like-minded individuals.

Going into a new adventure with my current NF I felt very different about these things. Because I am choosing to work for a family, in what may be arguably one of the most intimate roles an outsider can perform, I want to support their family in the way that is best for them. We recently have discussed religion, politics, and family values. Fortunately, the family’s viewpoints strongly resemble my own! However, I had already decided that if they had differences in regards to beliefs, I would integrate those into my work to the best of my ability.

For example: if they shared they were a very religious family who prayed before meals, I would encourage the children to do so while I was there. On president’s day, if they wanted me to talk about the left and right, or specifically about certain presidents, I was willing. If they have specific beliefs on discipline or free range parenting, I would try to align my work with these beliefs. This allows consistency for the children, who are the most important members of the NF (if you ask me).

Now, in regards to MY sexuality, personal beliefs, even preferences for presidential candidates: I do not feel those are details I would be openly sharing with the children or parents. If it comes up, I’d be honest, and I would then expect them to respect me just as I do them.

If at any point conversation or something in the home had a negative impact on my mental health, or I felt uncomfortable, I would attempt to have a conversation with the parents. If I do not explain that something is harmful to me, I cannot expect it to change. If I do speak my truths and the behavior continues, I would resign pretty quickly.

I think acceptance and respect, for me, comes easier with a NF. However it needs to be a two-way street!! At the end of the day, protect yourself. If your NF’s political beliefs are interfering with your ability to work or making you feel uncomfortable, do something to remedy it! 

Good luck!"

Just yesterday, 19moM randomly began the saying we do for heart and oval. I was so proud!"
EatingDisorders,fimwo4l,t3_f8pila,1582549423.0,"For me, there are a number of traumas or topics that will push me to wanting to “numb out” by means of eating disorder behaviors. I think the bottom line for me is anything that makes me feel inadequate or unheard. I use behaviors, or frequently have urges, when I am not where I feel I should be in life. Honestly, after struggling with an eating disorder for 21 years, there sometimes is no identifiable reason. I have gone for long periods without engaging in restricting, but have always circled back. I have also been in therapy for years. I would like to say I am fairly self aware, and can identify most reasons I choose to restrict. Unfortunately my self-esteem is so low that even if I know why I am using eating disorder behaviors, and know it is unnecessary or unhelpful, I still choose to engage. 

I guess what I am getting at is even with the knowledge of my deeper issues, it is still a struggle to make healthy choices. Hoping it gets easier for all of us."

eating_disorders,fhfp4sz,t3_f2u3t5,1581548086.0,"I have a few, mostly from treatment. It can be very tricky! I have to be sure I am in a good place to talk with them, or it can be very triggering and becomes competitive. However, the few friends I have remaining that I keep in touch with are friends on a deeper level than just the eating disorder. It is so nice to have them in my corner when I am struggling, because I know they completely understand what I am going through. We talk WAY more frequently about just “normal” life, which is nice.

I have had to eliminate several of my friends who have EDs though, because they were toxic. I would just say, be careful!! And good luck to you!"

memes,fhcpddm,t1_fhc3tw0,1581467904.0,"I agree with you, but I think it may be a financial thing now. Rehab costs are outrageous, and very difficult for many to afford. Insurance companies rarely want to pay out. Jails/prisons are taxpayer funded, and offers no help which is why the recidivism rate is what it is. There is also some inherent racism in there for jailing drug offenders for the amount of time they do. America sucks. Vote Bernie."

So, I spoke with our director. Apparently the policy at our center is to NOT inform the parents, nor do they permit individuals who are leaving to say anything. Does this seem right to any of you??

ChildcareWorkers,faneq9u,t3_e9z7s3,1576237499.0,"I work in a childcare center and I had a similar issue with a little girl who would be dropped off into my care. After mom left, she would quickly calm and have no issues the rest of the day. She is in my class of 7 children too! I really felt the parents would think something was wrong as well. We developed a plan where she would go to the calm down cube each morning, but had mom place her there immediately upon arrival. This only took about a week for her to warm up. Now she leaves mom in the mornings and runs into my arms to get hugs. Maybe have the child go to a corner (set it up with books or plush animals). Have his guardian place him there and allow him to come to you when ready. If he is placed their before the guardian leaves he won’t feel as if you are doing it. This way he feels in control of the situation. This worked for us! Good luck!"
ChildcareWorkers,fadmdse,t3_e8mezi,1575978891.0,"At our center we will keep children with very challenging behaviors right next to us (we say, “on our pocket”). I have a child in my class who has very poor social skills similar to what you have described here. For an entire week I had him right next to me the entire day. Sitting down in close proximity while I completed any task or in my lap while I would be on the floor playing with other children. For the week he did not get to interact with his peers or play with toys. This worked incredibly well, because he quickly became sick of the negative attention and wanted to join his peer group. During that week I constantly explained to him why he was not allowed to play. It seems mean, but it is a different method of teaching a child. It also saved me a ton of stress and yelling at him!!! Good luck!"

EatingDisorders,f9y2yyw,t3_e7cmki,1575722543.0,"Hi! I am happy to hear that you were able to recover on your own. That takes so much courage and strength. From my experience, the first year or so in recovery can be the toughest because of the strain the ED has put on the body. In regards to feeling as if you now have developed some BED characteristics- Do you log your meals? My therapist prefers that I keep track of my meals through an app called Recovery Record. I know for me personally, I can sometimes feel like I am eating a larger quantity of food, but when I log it I recognize that it is normal, or close to. I suppose I may still be privy to those disordered thoughts. Also, I know when I am feeling concerned about my weight, or body image, I sometimes will subconsciously restrict throughout the day for some meals which leads to mindless snacking or bingeing at night. This is due to the unstable blood sugar in my body which causes cravings! It has helped me a great deal to have 5 or 6 smaller meals throughout my day. I try to focus on having a healthy lifestyle opposed to losing any weight. This mind set generally sets me up for success. I’m not sure if that is helpful or not to you! Maybe you could also look into peer support groups in your area? I know there are not many, but having some other individuals who understand may help with accountability as well. Eating disorders are such slippery slopes in recovery! Good luck!"

eating_disorders,f9texum,t3_e6p0up,1575620666.0,"A binge, historically for me, was always the result of low blood sugar from restricting throughout the day. The body then craves nutrients, so the result is overcompensating on a later meal. Try having smaller snacks/meals spread evenly throughout the day. This will also keep your metabolism from tanking. Good luck!"
