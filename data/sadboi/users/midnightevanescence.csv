You might be right about the test. That is a common thing too. But the more often she does this specific thing, where she breaks up with you repeatedly and then you have a conversation with her that's likely emotionally draining, the more stress it will put on you.

Remember to take your needs into account as well. Is she well enough to actually meet them? Is she well enough to see this behavior for what it is and work on taking to you instead of making kneejerk decisions that could eventually be final if she keeps pushing?

One way or another, she needs to take responsibility for her behaviour. If you don't say that boundary, she will unintentionally become reliant on toxic behavior to cope. As her partner, that is easy for you both too fall into so I'd advise you to be careful about that if you want to keep this relationship going."

BPD,fq7hgo4,t3_gh9ymc,1589146444.0,"Sounds to me like she's basically sabotaging the relationship, which is common for people with BPD to do. Their main fear is abandonment, so that leave before they can be abandoned. So basically every time this fear is triggered, she breaks up with you, and then she backpedals on it perhaps because she doesn't truly want to break up but can't cope with her anxiety either.

The problem is, she might not stop this behavior unless she's getting therapy or is willing to go and resolve these poor behaviors. If she isn't willing to do that, you might need to set firm boundaries regarding a real breakup, or if she tries to break up again, insist that it is real and that you will not contact her again.

It's unfair of her to keep ping ponging like this regardless of the reasons. She had to step up or let you go."

BPD,fmosrlj,t3_fwknaw,1586267709.0,"It sounds like a subconscious fear of commitment or getting hurt, which is pretty common for people who suffer from BPD.

You'll have to do some self reflection to pinpoint the root of the issue, because I can only theorize, but here is my take.

You are subconsciously looking for a reason for the relationship to fail. You have likely done this with all other relationships, because having ""impossible standards"" means you'll be safe from getting hurt. Now that you have someone who meets those standards, your subconscious is scrambling for ANY reason to sabotage the relationship because he can't hurt you if you don't let your guard down. If you expect things to fall through, it won't be as devastating.

Why you're doing that is another question I can't answer for you. It might be you're afraid to commit, it might be you expect the bottom to fall out of every good thing in your life, it might be a fear of abandonment pushing you to convince yourself he can't be the one, etc. That's inner work you'll need to do to figure out.

In the meantime, I recommend just being honest with him about this struggle, because you're genuinely not used to things working out and it's scary. If you can work through this with him, there's a chance you won't sabotage the relationship."

That you appreciate all the support they've given you, but you feel you're not in a place where you can have a healthy romantic relationship and that you need to focus on working on yourself.

I know that makes it seem like you're not holding them responsible for how they've betrayed you, but think about how that approach would look to them. You're being the mature, reasonable one.

They haven't just outgrown you. You have outgrown them. Whatever your dynamic was, it wasn't growing with the both of you, and so it faded.

BPD,fkns39t,t3_fjlhko,1584372748.0,"Having BPD is like waiting for the bottom to fall out regarding everything good in your life. It's believing you've fooled everyone into believing you're worth their time and waiting for then to figure out the ""truth"". It's analyzing everything that's said to you, comparing it to this they say to other people or even in the future, and looking for inconsistencies to ""prove"" they're lying to you. It's not being able to accept that you are truly loved, and instead believing that they must be using you.

BPD is chronic distrust of others, of yourself, of reality, and what you deserve. You never know how much of your thoughts and beliefs are based in lies BPD tells you, so everything is a lie. You never know if the relationships you have are toxic or if YOU'RE toxic. You never know if the person you're upset with is actually in the wrong or if you're overreacting. You never know if something's actually wrong with a relationship or if you're just paranoid. It's costantly second-guessing yourself and everything your perceive because your perception is flawed.

BPD is a lot of things, and a lot of it is based on a fear of abandonment. Most of all though, it's rooted in your feelings being shameful, wrong, worthless. You feel worthless. You feel like a monster because everything hurts so damn much, and that pain drives you to hurt others, regardless of intention. You destroy relationships, convinced you're in the right, but you'll never know if it was an illusion you created subconsciously in a misguided attempt to protect yourself.

Life is just a thing that's happening around me and I feel I'm being dragged along, as if I'm on a leash because I'm stuck inside a carcass that is still considered alive even though I feel dead.

Emptiness is more like a hole in my gut that I can't fill with anything for long. Life is a series of a addictions to plug that hole, and when I run out of addictions to plug it with, it widens and swallows me. I want to do things. I want to be productive.

2. They aren't always aware of how harsh they might sound. Try not to take it personally, but let them know if it hurts and why it hurts. They won't know if your don't tell them.
3. They don't usually base their actions off emotions. Their actions are based in logic. If it doesn't make logical sense to them, they might dismiss it. If your need them to understand, explain.
4. They fixate on certain things. It's part of how their brains work. You might not understand why, but try to have an open mind about it.
5. They can get overstimulated easily. This can be anything from touch, texture, loud noises, crowds, etc. If they get overwhelmed, be understanding and help them through it. What helps them will be unique from someone else. Talk with them about their needs.
6. They might need space sometimes to process emotions, thoughts, problems, etc. Don't take this personally. It's just easier for them to work some things out by themselves.

BPD,fj4s50h,t3_fbjt97,1583015585.0,"All the time, tbh. But you know what? It will pass. It might feel like an eternity, but it will. Just breathe. You can do this."
BPD,fj4e1zg,t3_fbhrbs,1583006111.0,"I don't know your friend. Their triggers might be different from mine, but here is what I would say.

""Hey. I wanted to touch base with you after our last conversation because I am genuinely worried about you. I want you to know that I am not giving up on our friendship. I want to fight for it because you are worth more to me than your challenges. I really want to talk about this with you, but I don't want to hurt you further. How can we move forward and solve this together? I never meant to hurt or scare you. Let's figure this out."""
BPD,fj48uul,t3_fbh69z,1583002883.0,Thank you for this. I bookmarked it in case I need to see it again.
BPD,fj3ysvs,t3_fbeqfr,1582996322.0,"Right now?

""I love you. You have made such a difference in my life and I want you to know that I cherish every moment we spend together, even when it seems like I don't really appreciate it or I don't care as much as you do. I do care, more than you know and nothing is going to change that. Not BPD, not anxiety, not meltdowns, or paranoia. Everything you have given me is worth so much more than your flaws, and I'm going to keep fighting for you and for us, always.""

But in a tone that feels open and loving, so I don't feel like a ten million pound burden or a manipulative monster."
BPD,fj3y9bh,t3_fbfeq8,1582995958.0,Right there with you. So sick of myself that I'm dead inside.
BPD,fj1ozvp,t1_fj1ovzk,1582924642.0,"Even if you forget, you still matter, I promise. You never stop mattering, and you'll never stop being smart. Just keeping being you. You're allowed to have space in this world."
BPD,fj1oqtf,t1_fj1omuq,1582924491.0,They're all assholes who think mocking someone is funny. They don't matter either. You're still you and you still matter. You're smart. Nothing they think changes that.
BPD,fj1ojtt,t1_fj1of00,1582924375.0,You're welcome. People are so cruel. Just remember some stranger on the internet doesn't matter. They don't know you.
BPD,fj1obnw,t3_fb1cts,1582924238.0,"That person is someone random in a random part of the world who felt like mocking you for an unknown reason.

Realistically, they know literally nothing about you. They're just making assumptions or saying whatever to stroke their own ego.

It's okay to be afraid of your perception of yourself shattering. That's normal.

As to how intelligent you are? We're all intelligent in multiple ways. An IQ test can't measure everything. Don't let those results make you feel stupid."
BPD,fj0pmjb,t1_fj0pig7,1582905162.0,I'm glad you're looking into getting help. I'm waiting to get into a DBT group therapy myself. Good luck.
BPD,fj04iwx,t3_fasu0t,1582888707.0,"I'm sorry for what you went through. It's perfectly understandable that you don't want to invite family into your life again. You're just trying to protect yourself.

I sort of feel the same way. My mother probably has BPD and her whole side of the family was toxic. I don't really like spending time with any of them and I cut my mother out of my life.

My dad was an emotionally unavailable alcoholic, but I can tolerate him in small doses. I even care about him because he supports me and my husband financially regarding our car, and he's proven he actually cares. I was really close to my grandparents on his side, and we spend Christmas Day with his brother's family, but that's it. I don't have much contact with family because it's draining, even when I do feel wanted.

I don't know. I know it's not the same but thought I'd share."
BPD,fiyohcn,t3_fajf00,1582843474.0,"Just recently realized what a fucking monster I am, so I feel this."
BPD,fiylc2f,t1_fiykx68,1582841659.0,"I'm sorry you suffer through those things. I don't often have outbursts at that level. When I do, I internalize them, isolate, and cry a lot. I'm not perfect either of course. My husband has no friends so he spends all his time with me, which isn't healthy. Unfortunately, it's not easy to make friends in your late thirties so here we are.

I genuinely hope you can find a way to manage your emotions and find someone who sees your good qualities and decides to stick by you."
BPD,fiykjj3,t1_fiyk7p6,1582841198.0,"I've never threatened suicide. But I do joke about it a lot. About how I wish I was dead when I'm depressed. I have my fair share of breakdowns, angry outbursts, devaluation too. Manipulation is a little more subtle and subconscious for me, but yes, he's dealt with all of that quietly. I don't know why he thinks I'm worth the trouble, since I consider myself human garbage, but apparently he does."
BPD,fiygr2e,t3_faf2sm,1582839099.0,Been with my husband for 18 years or so and he just tends to quietly weather my storms.
BPD,fixdhza,t3_fadech,1582818219.0,"It's admirable that you want to figure it what kinds of boundaries need to be set, but please keep in mind that everyone is different. People with BPD have different triggers, different ways of reacting, different levels of self awareness, etc.

From what little you did say about your boyfriend, I would say he's not completely self aware regarding how he hurts you or what it stems from. Remember that trauma and triggers aren't always obvious to the person. They often act out because they're in pain and they justify it because of that pain. It doesn't make him right or make you wrong. It depends entirely on the situation.

It's hard to suggest boundaries because I'm not sure what your troubles are, but I would suggest starting there. What things does he do that are hurtful? Why did they happen? Did they seem random? Is it possible he was splitting at the time? These behaviors are things he needs to be made aware of so he can learn when it's BPD talking and when it's him talking. That is really hard to differentiate."
BPD,fiwuwnl,t3_faajaq,1582804068.0,"Your post just gave me an important realization, so thank you for that.

To touch on what you said, I think I've fallen into that loop on some level. But I get no fulfillment out of shallow relationships, so I just have to run with the punches. Sometimes I spiral because I feel mediocre. I give up for awhile, but I eventually find my drive again. I don't know how or why. I just do. I guess passion sometimes outweighs mediocrity.

As for feeling secure because I'm better than someone else? That hasn't really worked out for me, though I've tried. The problem is that people grow and it's not always feasible to assume you're always going to be better, or that you won't find yourself at their level.

Life is a bitch that way."
BPD,fiupxzd,t1_fitzsab,1582746071.0,"You're not alone. Sometimes I get the feeling that my FP doesn't really think I try not to bother them with my insecurities, but in reality, I'm only bothering them an average of every three months when my brain is literally doing this all day long. This month, I admit, was worse than usual because I just got diagnosed and my whole world feels like it's been turned upside down. Oh well, right? Back to being quietly depressed."

BPD,fitp3mm,t3_f9raxe,1582726120.0,"I went through this recently and had myself convinced my FP was abandoning me, or ignoring me, or giving up on me, or didn't trust me anymore. In reality, they fell asleep. The struggle is real."
BPD,fiqqoqy,t3_f9c9kr,1582649935.0,"I can see what you're going for, though it sounds preemptive, intentional, when, for me personally, it's more like I am the grenade, and the thing that might trigger me is the pin getting pulled out, and the meltdown is the explosion.  


As for how I would describe it? A black hole, constantly needing to be fed, but nothing ever being enough."
