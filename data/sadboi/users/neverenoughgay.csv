Rollerskating,fr5n62n,t3_gmowsa,1589911330.0,Sorry didn’t know I had to add a description. I got these Boardwalks about 2 weeks ago from Fritzy’s in San Diego (shipped to Chicago). I’m totally new to skating and I mostly got these because they seem to have a good reputation and Fritzys is one of the few places in the US that still seems to be in stock!

I had super bad insomnia so I was always the last to fall asleep and I avoided sleepovers specifically because of the watching people sleep thing. Interesting. It’s nice to know why though!!

I’m getting kind of nervous about what that means for starting my next placement because I only have a one week buffer between them. Worst case scenario I’m going to have to start my second placement late and stay at my first longer or I’ll stay at my second placement longer.
Neither are ideal scenarios

Also my school has said the same thing. 12 weeks and to let them know if our site cancels."

CPTSD,fk5jcd2,t1_fk51hh3,1583881689.0,Same. My insomnia was honestly way worse when I was a kid. I like barely slept. I sleep a little better now but if I don’t use melatonin I don’t sleep. My anxiety is still as bad as ever.
CPTSD,fk5j56h,t3_fggbh6,1583881571.0,Yup. I was a really happy little kid but I’ve been depressed since I was 8. I remember telling my first therapist when I was 9 that I didn’t understand why people are afraid of dying because I wanted to die.

CPTSD,firp7ns,t3_f8sc5e,1582668714.0,Yup and it sucks because I’m currently in an internship and whenever my supervisor is watching I freeze. I know these are things that I can do but I’m so afraid of messing up and people’s responses when I mess up that I don’t do anything. I’m just so used to messing up being the absolute end of the world because that’s what happened growing up.

CPTSD,firf0ol,t3_f95e23,1582663142.0,"Ya I had pretty bad insomnia growing up. But it was always because I had super bad anxiety and no outlet for it. I was pretty emotionally neglected so even when I would tell my parents that stuff was making me nervous and making it hard for me to sleep they would pretty much send me back to bed without helping at all. I’m still learning ways to reduce that anxiety before bed and it’s definitely getting better. I really wish someone would’ve helped me with it earlier though. 

Now I use melatonin and meditation before bed. I still have my stuffed toy from when I was a kid that I sleep with. I also read for about an hour before bed and then have Friends playing in the background because I know all of the episodes really well so it doesn’t keep me up."

antiwork,fi4bgb0,t3_f62oqx,1582137807.0,"I have social anxiety, CPTSD, and depression and I think there’s absolutely a line between what is caused by work and what just is. 

My CPTSD didn’t come from work, it came from childhood trauma. And that’s something that I want to heal from beyond issues related to work. 

My social anxiety and depression are essentially genetic. My whole family suffers with various levels of anxiety and depression.

I think work is really just something that exacerbates everything. Without work, I would still be mentally ill and I would still want to heal. Work makes it harder because I have less time to focus on recovery and I have to be around people everyday which is anxiety inducing and when I don’t have enough time to do things I love I feel more depressed. But those things would exist without work. 

I think it depends on the person, but most of the time work is an exacerbating factor, not the cause."
CPTSD,fhg4543,t3_f2w8fj,1581558169.0,Oh.... both of my parents have anxiety.... this makes so much sense 🙃

CPTSD,fgmp5m0,t3_ezbyy7,1580929193.0,Absolutely. My boss keeps telling me to call out when I’m sick and I like genuinely have no concept of how sick is sick enough to call out. I force myself through work and chores and everything no matter how sick I am. It sucks.
CPTSD,fgmmcsl,t3_ez3b7h,1580927520.0,"I just sent this to my friends to explain why i feel this way. I just started clinicals for school and I’m putting so much effort into being a person all day and not showing my trauma and then i get home and eating and showering and everything is hard.
And on top of that I feel like since I’m in a new job that I’ve never done with new people everyone is trying to kind of figure me out and soooo much of who i am is based in my trauma. But I’m obviously not gonna be like “ya I’m like this because of the trauma” so I’m just kind of trying to seem extra normal right now. And it’s exhausting."
CPTSD,fftlx2d,t3_ev6cg0,1580223909.0,Yay!!! So proud of you!!
CPTSD,ffdtwli,t3_esvxy9,1579828821.0,Slightly related but I’ve been working on developing boundaries and at the same time I’ve started working at a therapeutic preschool for kids with autism. And there are a lot of kids who try to use other people’s bodies to stim and sometimes it really hurts. But I would just let the kids do stuff cuz I was like well they need this and I can help them so I’ll let it happen. And then one day this girl was shoving her chin into my arm really hard and my educator was like “you don’t have to let her do that??”. And it honestly blew my mind. Like I don’t have to suffer to make other people happy. And even typing that feels weird but it’s true. It’s just wild when people point stuff out like this or the burned toast. Like my brain so doesn’t process stuff the same way other people do.

CPTSD,fb7fhny,t3_ebmzaq,1576588323.0,"I’m so sorry this happened to you. I had many similar experiences. Once, when I was probably 7 or 8, I was in one of those blow up pools in my backyard and my brother went and got the dog’s little plastic pool and put it on top of me and sat on it, trying to drown me. Needless to say he didn’t because my mom just happened to run out of the house in time to stop him. Of course neither of them seem to remember that happening 🙄"
CPTSD,fb7f9nc,t1_fb6h0vd,1576588107.0,Ya this is something I talk about with my therapist A LOT. My parents always said this stuff to me. “Just stay away from him” was a big one. Worse for me was “well if you would stop annoying him he wouldn’t do that”. Like what a fucked up thing to tell a kid. That they’re at fault for what’s happening to them. And the things that were “annoying” were usually just me existing. Looking toward him or tapping my fingers or something.

mentalhealth,etx8hd6,t3_cdwcx4,1563293872.0,"My therapist gave me a couple reasons she thinks I have them. 

My brother has severe anger issues and needed a lot of attention growing up because of that. A lot of the time my parents would put the blame on me or on both of us rather than just him (we’re now 22 and 24 and to this day that still happens). A lot of times I would also miss out on attention because they were focused on what he needed. So basically I was emotionally neglected. 

My therapist mostly said this was why. That even when I thought my parents were there for me, they would “leave”. And I ended up with abandonment issues."
BPD,etx5rbq,t3_cdp8ah,1563292137.0,"I’ve always been a super anxious person. When I was like 12 I started compulsively lying for attention, but I don’t think I knew it was anything specific then. Around that time I started getting really depressed and suicidal and started cutting. I knew something was off then, but I don’t think it was until a couple years ago, my sophomore year of undergrad, when I started obsessing over my friend and where she was and what she was doing all the time that I realized something was really really off. But I thought it was a crush until I started getting insanely depressed over it and self harming and stuff over it."
mentalhealth,etx1h9o,t3_cdxsgs,1563289325.0,"Ya i absolutely hate Facebook. I still have an account but I rarely use it and when I do it just makes me depressed. I know people say all of this about Instagram but I honestly have less of an issue with it because I choose to follow mostly people I don’t know in real life like celebrities and stuff. 

Facebook just sucks because I can see what people are doing and they always make everything seem perfect like you said. It really fucks with my head. I also hate the whole having to friend everyone thing like you said. 

I never really posted much and i somehow managed to never do the ranting thing. About a year ago I went through and unfriended 90% of my “friends”. I’m down to like 40 people and frankly I’m only friends with some of them because they’re in my grad school class of only like 24 people and it would be awkward if I wasn’t friends with them. 

I still really hate it though. I don’t go on it when I can. I hate that I get emails about what people are posting. It’s like I’m being forced to look at things I’m avoiding. It just all sucks and I hate that so much of the population is part of it. It kind of makes me lose faith in humanity."
