relationships,flch45r,t3_fnrw1q,1585030641.0,"I’m the type of person who is very intentional with maintaining friendships. For example, I schedule dinners once a month with one friend. I write in my calendar to call friends once a month to schedule or confirm details about our next plan. I schedule group activities three months in advance and follow up multiple times leading up to the date. I call certain friends every week on my drive home from work. 

I am often the one to call others. I am usually the one scheduling or planning events for my friends and myself. My friends consistently tell me that they’re glad I called or glad I schedule far in advance and give them excessive reminders. 
Why don’t they call first or reach out to me? Because they’re busy adults working and living their lives! It doesn’t mean they like me any less or don’t want me in their lives. I am secure enough to know that we’re good friends and I’m just better at planning ahead. 

To be clear, there is a definite difference between a friendship where one person is better at planning and a one-sided relationship where the other person puts in zero effort and does not value you. I’m not talking about holding on to people who are not good friends. I’m not saying put in all the effort when the other person doesn’t care. 

Also, there are certain types of people who are not good at being distance friends. When you’re seeing them everyday you’ll be super close, then when you aren’t seeing them regularly anymore, they fade away and are bad at keeping in touch. That’s a bummer, but it’s also very normal. 

So anyways I guess my point is, keeping friends gets hard as you get older. Try not to take it personally."

Long story short, she made him cut off all contact with me even after I got engaged. It was mostly frustrating that he didn’t stand up to her and say that I was definitely not a threat. And since she forced him to get off all social media, I just hope he’s doing ok with all her crazy."

Have you tried a pie timer or other visual timer that can be put right next to the tv so they can see their time counting down? 
Then possibly a “leaving the house” checklist with all the tasks/expectations. 

Maybe instead of telling them 30 minutes until leaving the house, break it down into smaller increments. “We need to leave in 30 minutes. That means in 20 minutes your game needs to be all the way off, not just in rest mode. Then you have 10 minutes to be ready to leave the house. This means full checklist completed and real winter coats on your body.” And check in every few minutes to make sure they’re actually doing what they need to do.

Don’t let your dad convince you that you are unworthy of compliments and have no positive qualities. Even though I don’t know you, I know that you do have positive qualities. 

I’m not trying to make your dad out to be a bad guy, because he may very well have your best interest in mind. You may consider having a conversation with him about how you feel when he constantly criticizes you. If you know he will not be responsive to a conversation, then you will need to learn how to react to his criticism. You may want to consider going to therapy to work through this."

When DH and I were dating, we didn’t have much custody so he would be very excited when we did have his son. So excited that it was as if I didn’t exist. 

For example, I mentioned to DH multiple times that I’m really excited to watch a certain movie but I want to wait until we have SK to go see it. Then when I leave to run errands, I get back and find out DH chose to watch the movie with SK while I was gone. 

Or we’re walking a few blocks to a restaurant and DH is so engaged with SK that they don’t notice me asking them 3 times to wait up so I can tie my shoe (yes, I tapped DH on the shoulder and spoke at an indisputably appropriate volume). So they walk off without me and don’t even notice I was left behind. 

Or if we discuss money being tight until the end of the month, but SK wants something, so DH goes all out and spends money that we don’t have on stuff that SK really doesn’t need. 

So I guess it’s not so much about being second in love. Sometimes the small things that boil down to a lack of respect can make second place feel like a problem."

My SK is very pleasant for his age and we honestly do not have many problems. But when it’s just the two of us and I try to engage in conversations, I get one word answers. When DH asks him to do something, he does it no problem. When I ask him to do the same thing, he does it reluctantly. When I ask him whether he’s brushed his teeth or showered, he lies and says he did, but he doesn’t lie to DH. 
It’s hard to remain consistently enthusiastic in building a positive relationship when you put in effort and aren’t getting any positivity in return. DH never knew any of this until I pointed it out, so now he’s a bit more understanding.

By the end of the conversation we had worked through some miscommunication and assumptions. 

Another thing to think about is your personality type and your fears. Due to my personality type, I base a lot of my feelings of worth on my accomplishments and wanting people to respect me. Recognizing these motivations has helped me understand myself and my emotions better. 
I also have a fear of abandonment. It makes me feel like anytime people learn more about me, they might leave me if they don’t like what they discover. This helps me rationalize that my family isn’t ever going to love me less, it’s just my fears trying to push their way in."

He was a bit younger than 1 at the time but also very easy to train, so it was no problem for us. One negative is we have hardwood floors so we can hear him clicking around when he gets water or roams. That can get annoying if you’re a light sleeper. We are very happy with our decision not to kennel at night, but I think it definitely depends on how well-behaved your dog is."

But yeah, we do ask for extras for the kids who can’t afford it."
HumansBeingBros,eu32xew,t1_eu2k67n,1563404061.0,"I teach third grade. On the days that I let them use markers or pastels instead of the usual crayons and colored pencils, they get so excited. If something that small gets them motivated to work on a project (that has more substance to it than just a creative art project), then it’s worth it to me. 
We understand when parents can’t donate because of financial reasons. But when I see the kid with ten different pairs of new shoes getting picked up in a Tesla who can’t donate anything, that gets annoying. Keep in mind that I spend at least $75 of my own money every month on supplies to get these kids excited about learning."

I’m the type of person who would never ask out a guy in a million years because I’m extremely afraid of rejection. But once I’m in a relationship, I have zero problems expressing my needs/wants and otherwise communicating effectively."

workouts,et4qw9l,t3_c9xwoq,1562455644.0,"I believe in finding something that you enjoy. If you don’t like it, it’s going to be hard to keep with it. Try different activities until you find something that sticks. Also, I think it helps to view it as “living a healthy lifestyle” instead of just losing weight. 
If your goal is to lose weight, it’s also really important to consider what you are eating. Diets have never worked for me, so I eat the foods that I want, but I always eat mindfully and in moderation."

dating_advice,erxotl4,t1_erx2uma,1561390056.0,"I think escorts could help you learn how to socialize with (potentially beautiful) women with less pressure. They aren’t going to leave the date early or be rude to you because their job is to help you have a good time. They’ve also probably been on lots of dates so you could ask them about great dates that they’ve been on and good ways to continue conversation. Use them as a resource and learn from them. 

Also, stop referring to virgin life as “suffering.”"

relationships,erwd7rz,t3_c46swq,1561340180.0,"I had a friend who had honestly been a crappy friend for about a year and a half. He had even admitting to knowing he hadn‘t been a very good friend recently. When he made numerous lame excuses to not come to my engagement party (it was only 45 min away on a day that he said he  didn’t have anything going on, but he just didn’t feel like coming), I decided to cut him off. I didn’t send an email or anything, but I decided if he was too lazy to celebrate a very important day for me, he wasn’t worth keeping around. Pretty much, it was just the last straw. 

If you reflect on your relationship with your friend recently, has it been a good relationship or has it been strained? Has she been asking for support from you and have you been able to give it? Has it been a one-sided relationship? If everything has seemingly been fine, then maybe there are underlying issues that she never brought up with you. 

If your relationship truly has been strong and this is an isolated incident then I think she is overreacting. A lot of brides start to think the world revolves around them and get unrealistic expectations of what they “deserve.” Maybe give your friend the space she requested, and in the meantime, write up a message that expresses the hurt you feel and leave the ball in her court to make amends. When the time is right send her your message and prepare yourself to be ok with whatever happens. 

Some friendships are temporary and some make it through hard times. I wish you the best."
CasualConversation,erpx3m5,t1_erotzs9,1561130067.0,"Idk your relationship status, but keep in mind a future SO’s with an old fashioned family. My grandma is anti-tattoo so everyone covers up tattoos before seeing her. It’s easy for my husband who has them on his back and shoulders. It wouldn’t be as fun to wear long sleeves on a hot day....but then again, that could only be a couple days out of the year. Just something small to consider."
dating_advice,erpw8o0,t3_c398cn,1561129488.0,"I once dated a guy who hid me for months and I was like “eh nbm we’re just taking it slow.” Until his ex became single again, he ditched me in a second, and I was upset for months. 

My next boyfriend was so excited to be dating me, he was telling anyone and everyone about me. He loved to introduce me to his friends and family and was so proud to call me his girlfriend. 

I never realized how wrong the first relationship was until I was in the second. Your boyfriend should feel lucky to be with you and make you feel amazing. Btw, I married the second guy, and life is great."
