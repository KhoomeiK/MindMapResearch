He's not even ugly like that he's just not a ""pretty boy""  and has good size lips on him. Only compared to beyonce who is obvs more beautiful would you say he looks rough"

SuicideWatch,fd5m7c6,t3_ejysqk,1578178982.0,"I think i understand. Life feels  unbearable,death is irreversible, wondering which one  is worth commiting to. People always say it gets better. I just consider this time I fear choosing one or the other as me sticking around to see if it will"
Sleepparalysis,f5ek0e5,t1_f5c0dki,1572171654.0,"Thanks for your insight on the situation. I agree that we are much more vulnerable during sleep because our guard is down, especially when just starting to rebuild our faith and relationship with God. I have started to say a prayer of protection before I sleep because as you said there is a spiritual battle waging day and night .  God Bless."
Sleepparalysis,f5efoxu,t1_f5b6nnu,1572169918.0,"My dad had epilepsy. He passed away earlier this year.  It did occur to me that it could be a seizure but I was a bit apprehensive to even think about it or write it in my post.  

 I'm trying not to jump too far ahead and put my mind at ease, as I've had sleep paralysis before It might just be that but maybe I will speak to the doctor about it.  Thanks for the suggestions."
Medicalabusesurvivors,f2sknag,t1_esmf1ia,1570384148.0,"Only just seen this comment now.  I find it odd how you picked those statements, most of which only add additional information, to make your final decision about the treatment I received from my doctor but I guess that's an easy thing for someone to do when they haven't had a similar experience or get annoyed when they see someone receiving understanding and support.

Oh and to address your statement  of  me being ""massively sexually inexperienced"". Well, sorry but at my age i see nothing for a doctor, or anyone for that matter to giggle about. There's nothing wrong with having sex or being sexually adventurous but it's honorable for any young woman or man to do what they please with their body despite what society deems as being ""normal"".

Hope you have a good day and stay blessed :)"
