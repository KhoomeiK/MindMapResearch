therapy,fqw6wai,t1_fqsw08c,1589694577.0,This! It was really just a motivation thing for me.

Also, realistically after two dates is pretty soon to end things. You need a few times of meeting up and getting to know each other in order to decide if it’s something you want to pursue. Usually if someone gives up after the first date it means it was a terrible date but just because it wasn’t terrible doesn’t mean he’s interested"

If you do you can have casual conversations, just text him every once in a while so he feels comfortable enough to reach out too? For me I want to be able to talk to him but I don’t want to feel like I’m bothering him so I’d want him to talk to me first. Not that you need to initiate every conversation but also not just leave him on read. And you can make sure to have boundaries if any uncomfortable topics come up like if you don’t want to talk about the relationship and just be honest about how you feel!

On the other hand, if you genuinely don’t want a friendship with him and don’t want to talk to him you don’t have to. Don’t put in your energy to do something out of guilt. It’s not your responsibility"
BreakUps,fntaxi2,t3_g3opkh,1587238026.0,"Nothings wrong with you! I totally get how you feel. It’s probably like an unconditional love you had for him, it’s hard to walk away from that. You still loved him after everything and that’s ok, you can love someone but still realize you deserve better."

BreakUps,fnt7azl,t3_g3prge,1587235995.0,"Maybe he stopped watching them when you broke up as part of the process of moving on and didn’t want to think about you and now that he’s moving on watching your stories doesn’t affect him? Idk I don’t think it’s weird or means anything  that he’s watching your stories. If you guys were actually like personally snap chatting each other then maybe? If it bothers you then you can unfriend him. But taking the time to worry or think about if it’s “weird” isn’t worth the energy and doesn’t really matter, if he’s in a new relationship that’s the new girls problem not yours."
BreakUps,fnt5s3f,t3_g3qdzp,1587235154.0,I would put his stuff and the bracelet in a bag/box and throw it under the bed or back of the closet where you won’t see it. It’s not worth the worry/thought about figuring out how to give it to him. If you’re trying to get over him and the bracelet reminds you of him then keep it out of sight. Since it was a gift you don’t need to give it back and don’t think he’ll have a use for it anyways. Keep it sell it throw it away it’s up to you. Give his stuff back later when you’ve gotten over the breakup or if he really needs it he’ll ask for it. If he never reaches out after a long time I’d say throw it all away. For me seeing physical stuff like that from an ex after a fresh breakup just makes things worse and I like to keep it out of sight out of mind.
BPD,fnott9c,t1_fno1jfz,1587133462.0,"In a similar situation... I cry pretty easily and I dont like it and can’t really control it and it’s heartbreaking to see him just like not really care, there’s no empathy, and because I do it so much he just doesn’t think it’s a big deal and thinks nothing is actually wrong. I get triggered whenever I feel like he doesn’t care about me so this reaction from him just makes everything feel worse"
relationship_advice,fn5jiyh,t1_fn5j2wm,1586666572.0,I guess that’s true.. I just was wondering if the unusual circumstances means I should give him the benefit of the doubt. Like if anyone had been in a similar situation and in the future if they tried to move in together again if things were different because they just weren’t ready
relationship_advice,fn5ik7g,t1_fn5i36v,1586665820.0,Yeah... I mean he told me that he wanted me to leave so I did and went back home even though it’s not the ideal situation here. I just don’t know how to approach my relationship with him now. I’m just worried that if this is behavior that won’t change I know it’s not how I want to live forever or if this is actually common behavior of someone who is just simply not ready to move in with someone
relationship_advice,fn5h5tz,t1_fn59m44,1586664747.0,I was talking to him about how my life at home wasn’t going well and how I was stressed about being quarantined and having to be there all the time and he offered for me to stay with him. I guess I’m not enjoying it but it’s better than being at home. I just don’t know if that’s a good reason to stay though
relationship_advice,fn5gynd,t1_fn56ox2,1586664595.0,Thanks for your reply! But I’m not really sure I think he’s just the type of person who needs their alone time and he just actually likes being alone. I don’t know if it’s just stressful with him because we’re quarantined so we’re physically around each other like 24/7 or if he just doesn’t want to live with someone or isn’t ready. It was just weird to me that he didn’t want to compromise at all. And I just felt like I was in a position where it felt like he was holding this over my head that he was doing this huge favor for me. Like i am grateful and I’ve told him that but I don’t know why I have to feel like it’s his way or the highway with everything we do. And if he’s “not ready” is this something that will just change? I just can’t wrap my head around how “being ready” would change. If he actually cares about me now then why wouldn’t he make the effort?

Some people will keep trying to make a relationship work even if it has past their breaking point and once the relationship is over it seems like they’ve moved on fast when in reality the relationship had been going downhill for a while. A similar thing happened to me and my ex. He told me he was hurt because he thought I moved on so fast and it made him feel like the relationship meant nothing to me. That wasn’t true, it’s just that we had so many issues like the last year of our relationship and there were many times we should have broken up but we didn’t. I was always willing to make it work but I just kept getting hurt and after a while I just couldn’t do it anymore. I blocked my ex because I knew he was constantly checking up on my social media and doing that makes it a lot harder to move on."

socialskills,f811nao,t3_dyekio,1574145998.0,"Try hanging out with the person you’re trying to build the friendship with and do things that don’t require too much talking if you’re nervous! Like bowling or movies or in a group setting. Or something having to do with a common interest. Like say you both like football and go to a game or a bar to watch it. If you run about personal things to say then you can talk about football lol. Definitely conversations will flow better when you’re comfortable. 

I’m pretty shy and it takes a while to get comfortable around people and moments of awkward silences would KILL me I would be so uncomfortable but it was all in my head. I tried to not view them as awkward and it was fine, just a short pause until I or the other person wanted to talk about something else. Because thinking about it, the only reason it made me uncomfortable was because I was worrying about what the other person thought and if THEY felt like it was awkward but I personally don’t think the actual “awkward pause” was bad 

But also to agree with other reply’s on this post, asking someone to hang out doesn’t mean you have to “entertain them” you both have to make an effort"
OnlyChild,f6n15zj,t3_dru7je,1572983006.0,"I relate to this so much! Both of my parents are from different countries, so I didn’t have much interaction with family outside just my parents, and on the rare occasions I would travel and did, it was difficult because of language barriers. I feel like I was always kinda lonely and shy, with only a few friends, but didn’t really realize until after I moved out of my freshman dorms in college. I was so happy to be around people my age all the time and having people to talk to if I wanted. I literally cried on move out day and I feel like it’s been kinda downhill from there. I became terrified of being alone and dying alone and put so much stress in the few friendships I had and had kind of a toxic relationship in order to just stay in it. I eventually got into a really dark place and decided to start going to therapy and I think it’s helped quite a bit, I would definitely recommend it is you can. I’ve come to realize that you can’t focus on the things you missed out on or how your life could have been better and you should focus on what you can do now! I know it’s easier said than done I definitely have phases where I am like that and can’t help but think that way and compare myself to others but I try to be positive if I can. And if you’re trying to make friends maybe try to find some social hobbies, or somewhere you see the same people every day. I started going to a gym that has lots of group classes and have made some good friends from there. Or I’m not sure your living situation but maybe try finding a roommate(s) I feel like it will make you feel less lonely."

“
Use this exercise to quickly ground yourself in the present when you only have a moment. The goal is to notice something that you are currently experiencing through each of your senses.
What are 5 things you can see? Look around you and notice 5 things you hadn’t noticed before. Maybe a pattern on a wall, light reflecting from a surface, or a knick-knack in the corner of a room.
What are 4 things you can feel? Maybe you can feel the pressure of your feet on the floor, your shirt resting on your shoulders, or the temperature on your skin. Pick up an object and notice its texture.
What are 3 things you can hear? Notice all the background sounds you had been filtering out, such as an air-conditioning, birds chirping, or cars on a distant street.
What are 2 things you can smell? Maybe you can smell flowers, coffee, or freshly cut grass. It doesn’t have to be a nice smell either: maybe there’s an overflowing trash can or sewer.
What is 1 thing you can taste? Pop a piece of gum in your mouth, sip a drink, eat a snack if you have one, or simply notice how your mouth tastes. “Taste” the air to see how it feels on your tongue.

But at the same time, dating apps make me kinda nervous and I’m very hot and cold when it comes to using it I’ll like not check it for days because I’ll be frustrated that it’s not as easy as I thought it would be, which leads me to not respond to people for a while. Sometimes I’ll feel bad or like feel awkward for not responding for a while that I just won’t but it has nothing to do with the guy. Also a tip is to always make an effort to keep the conversation going! For me it’s kinda annoying if I’m the one always asking questions and they just answer without asking something back. It kinda just feels like an interview so I’ll stop responding if they don’t ask me something back. And if you’re having a good conversation don’t be afraid to double text if they don’t respond. It won’t hurt anything. Maybe they were busy and didn’t see your message or need a reminder. Either it will help you out or won’t change anything

I just got out of a 4 year relationship about one or two months before talking to and developing feelings for a new guy. I quickly became so codependent with him and I’m not sure if I’ve always been like that or I just didn’t realize it in my last relationship where he gave me attention all the time and might have been enabling me or if it was because of the new breakup. This new guy doesn’t want anything serious and may be emotionally unavailable but always says he likes and cares about me so much. The insecurity of him not wanting a relationship hurts me so much and triggers some really bad anxiety when I’m not around him and don’t know what he’s doing. But that feeling I get when I’m with him is so good that I don’t want to give it up. I’ve still been talking to him for the past few months but it’s been rough I feel like I need to be around him constantly and am sad when I’m not."

Codependency,ewg3a3v,t1_ewg034j,1565372946.0,"Hi, I recently discovered this page and even just the idea of codependency and I’m still learning so much about it but I feel like it really applies to me and feel I may be struggling with it. I feel like a lot of my emotions come from the fear of being alone and also just the discomfort of it. I feel like I’m only happy when I’m physically with other people. Reading this comment what stuck out to my was you said you “worked on feeling safe and whole by myself” and I was wondering what you did to work on that? I feel like I know that I NEED to work on being happy by myself and enjoy my own company and not have to rely on other people to be happy but I just don’t know HOW to do it, I feel stuck! I can’t get my head around how it’s possible to change my mindset in that aspect. I’ve tried small things like hiking or going to a restaurant by myself, things I enjoy, but I just don’t feel that happiness like when I’m with someone else."
