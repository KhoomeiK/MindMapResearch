2. Not that I know of. Everyone sort of has their own tactic. 

3. This is up to u and what u feel more comfortable using. I primarily just use Icetrap and MutaGen, mutagen is A1

4. I have monthly premium and it‚Äôs good for quicker construction times (they get really long as you progress) + the 20% bonus of resources and i really like the fact that battles are 2x the speed. The krampus pass isn‚Äôt worth it if you‚Äôre just gonna upgrade quickly, the gear that you get isn‚Äôt going to be useful.

5. I‚Äôve just heard about the Mimosa Grand Chest fear being leveled up if u do, while the others don‚Äôt 

6. Yes. Mimosa chests give the best gear. 

7. Don‚Äôt rush in leveling up your situation room or trying to get the most trophies. You‚Äôll end up going against ppl with a higher Squad Power than you. Get ur fighters to 5 stars.  Break apart useless gear in order to make better gear. Ex: I had a ton of rare items, broke them apart and got Epic gear in return which in turn led to legendary gear. Or you can save up your epic shards for the future."
