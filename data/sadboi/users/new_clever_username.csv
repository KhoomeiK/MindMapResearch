The reason the NCP gets in trouble for not paying is because the other parent has notified the courts of non payment. The custodial parent doesnt get in trouble for not allowing you to see your child because you havent notified the courts.

I dont understand why you dont want her to get in trouble. She kept your child from you. You can never get that time back. That is parental alienation and going against court orders.

I lay him down at 8 and he wouldnt fall asleep until hours later. Most nights I didnt think much of it. He always woke up happy.

Teaching and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance is not a way to brainwash children. What is wrong with showing love for your country? What is wrong with bringing your children up with love and respect for our country? We should ban it because some people dont like it? If that's the case we need to ban everything. We should ban it because some people do not believe in GOD? Atheist doesn't believe in GOD,  they have a problem with saying the Pledge of Allegiance but do they have a problem spending American money? All American money says in God we trust. Umm no they still spend USD. 

I dont think they should ban it but if children are being bullied or treated differently for not saying it that is something we need to change.

Find your closest recruiting office and speak to them. Ask them questions, see what they offer. 

Leaving with your dad, I think is not wise. He did abandon you and your siblings. I highly doubt he could help you get on your feet if he cant even do it himself. I know the idea of a father is so desirable but if he was worth a damn as a father he wouldnt have left so easily. I am a single parent. I deal with everything on my own. It gets so hard. I feel like I'm not good enough for my child but no matter how bad it gets I would never leave him for an easier life."
ADHD,fjfjioy,t1_fjewy70,1583293082.0,As someone who doesnt have ADHD I can answer this. It's a steady stream of thoughts. It's not erratic or thoughts all over the place. I would never describe my thoughts as quiet. I can think of something and continue to think of that topic or detail for a while.
AskParents,fjf64dq,t1_fjf24hv,1583285116.0,What time is their naptime? I would assume that even if he came in during naptime they would offer him a nap.

Parenting,fj7hbnc,t3_fbusot,1583091672.0,Would you be open to just let her playing around with it at home? But not wearing it outside the house? If you I would have a conversation with her before hand. Just to explain to her that you will let her wear it at home but she is not allowed to wear it outside or to school. If you find out that she is sneaking it out of the house you will take it back. This is a great opportunity for her to keep the trust between you two.
Frugal,fj7fv43,t1_fj6t4kg,1583091033.0,I want to say family mobile. I think T-Mobile bought them out. I went into Walmarts electronics department and just bought the activation packet.
Parenting,fj6rd03,t3_fbphnh,1583078500.0,When they dont eat the food save it for their next meal or when they are hungry again. If they dont eat dinner tell them you will be offered this for breakfast. My son was getting very picky. I just told him if you dont eat it now I will just give it to you the next time you eat or when you get hungry. He tried it at first after him seeing that he will eat it eventually he has stopped. Now he just eats what I give him. I mostly give him water to drink but I will tell him after you finish your food I will give you juice or milk.
family,fj6qqer,t3_fbsydw,1583078113.0,"Let's say you do ask him and he admits he did sleep with an escort. What would you do with that information? Highly doubt you would keep it to yourself. You would probably tell your mother and sister. What if you open Pandoras box? If you ask him and he denies it would you believe him and drop it?

I dont think you should say anything. You told your mother and she doesnt think he did. It's their relationship and you should leave it alone. You are not asking so your mother will know the turth but for your own curiosity. At the end of the day you should make the choice of what you can live with. But remember if this is true it affects more then just you."
relationships,fj6pq0b,t3_fbscel,1583077469.0,You shouldnt say anything. I know it's your parents but its their relationship and what happened is their business not yours.

relationships,fj6nc6c,t3_fbmzfc,1583076052.0,"Your mother feels guilty. It's not on you to ease her guilt. There is nothing you can do. You told her you are not mad at her and that you are just going through some things. 

On another note congratulations on saving so much money. You are 18 and understand the importance of a credit score and you have saving. I wish I did and understood the same thing at that age."
family,fj6mact,t3_fbp9fp,1583075403.0,"Let them say what they want. You have told them before and they didnt take it seriously. If they want to see your baby then they will have to come to your house. When they invite you over decline the invitation. If they ask why tell them you dont feel comfortable with your baby crawling all over the dirty house. It doesnt really matter that they think it's fine. 

I dont go to peoples houses if I know they are dirty. Growing up our house was always clean. We couldn't leave a mess or clutter. I didnt know anyone out side of my family who cleaned the same way. I am in no way a clean freak but there is a difference between messy and dirty."
AskParents,fj1t4n4,t3_fapxth,1582927178.0,"First let me say that I'm sorry you had to go through this. I understand why your not pressing charges (it can be very scary especially because you are somewhere you are not familiar with) but I am glad you went to the hospital and I do hope that you will seek some mental health help for this. This also wasnt your fault. You didnt do anything to deserve this. I dont care if you was sloppy drunk and hitting on every guy you came into contact with. This wasnt your fault you did not give consent. This is all on whoever did this to you. 

As a daughter who never wants to cause my mom more stress I understand where you are coming from. But as a mother I would want to know. As a mother I would want to be there for my child and help them heal and move on from what happened. I would want to be a support system for them in anyway I could."
Parenting,fix5zsy,t3_fa5s28,1582813482.0,"Its understandable your husband felt that seeing as how he was raised. You didnt cross any lines. Your son told you because he chose to not because he forced.

I think as parents we should talk to our children about sex. I dont mean tips, tricks, and techniques. But health wise, STDs, being safe, pregnancy (even if it is a boy), and what is consent."
povertyfinance,fivcyv8,t3_f8hom7,1582758124.0,"When I was really broke I would shop at the 99 cent store. I would buy all types of food and cleaning products. I would get their chips it doesn't taste as good as the real thing but it still chips. I would buy there body wash cleaning supplies. As far as the food you kind of have to be careful on that because it's actually not cheaper than a regular grocery store. The only things I would never by there would be pads, tampons, razors or dish soap."
povertyfinance,firbyrg,t3_f9cggw,1582661451.0,"From what I have seen they gave the money back before the investigation was completed. However, the investigation didnt go in the bank holders favor and they took the money back out."

ChildSupport,fio9eez,t3_f8xp36,1582578856.0,"I think if you could prove this it would help you get custody. I dont know if this applies to California but if your daughter is capable of telling the judge why she wants to live with you with a knowledgeable answer, the judge would take that into consideration. In my state the child doest necessarily have to be a certain age are there preference to be heard. In the meantime you should start documenting how you receive your daughter in. Like dirty clothes, bad hygiene and document how you are giving her back to her mother. Again I don't know if something like this would apply to California but child support and child custody are two different courts. So if you go in there for the child support to discuss the custody they may tell you file that separately. I would also start the process of custody ASAP."
povertyfinance,fio8jrr,t1_finy21e,1582578383.0,I have no idea. I'm sure not everyone who works in a daycare is certified in something.
povertyfinance,finxbdy,t3_f8uqyj,1582572061.0,I would look into your local resources on child care. In my particular area you have to already have a job to qualify for it and they do take him to how much you would make. Maybe look for work that you can do with your child.  One of the daycares in my son went to a lot of them had their children attend  while they were working. I know it is so scary the thought of leaving your baby with people that you don't know. When my son was younger I worried about that all the time. But if you are unhappy you're going to have to do something to change it. Feeling stuck is such a devastating feeling.
povertyfinance,finwvsm,t1_finws4y,1582571809.0,But if you do want to pay off your debt. While you're in Credit Karma if you click on the debt and you scroll down it does give you the contact information to the debt collector.
povertyfinance,finws4y,t3_f8jbv4,1582571748.0,I had a bank account when I was freshly 18. It went into collections and I ended up getting a call from the company who bought my debt. They wanted me to pay it and asked how I would go about it. I told them that that was on them I didn't ask them to do that. They never called me back and it does not show up on my credit report. I never thought about it again until just recently. When my girlfriend brought something up to me. To summarize it you are under no legal obligation to pay a debt to a company who bought your debt. When you acquired the debt you entered into a contract with the original creditor. I don't know if this would work with everything but I do know years ago it did work in my advantage.

Parenting,finj7ad,t3_f8scy1,1582564316.0,"I think if a child has hours of homework every night than the teachers and the school system are not doing their job correctly. Not all students can learn on their own. At the end of the day there are still children. The entire day should not consist of going to school and then doing hours of homework, eating and then going to bed. They need time to be children."
ADHD,finiino,t1_fim3iy4,1582563949.0,"Thank you for your feedback. I never want him to feel like he isnt good enough or different in a bad way. I tell him all time that everyone is different but we are all humans. Different is better. It's like crayons, you want alot of different colors just not one. I think he can understand that analogy."
AskParents,fin5ckq,t3_f8mxji,1582556153.0,You need to go to court. Showing up at the house is not a good idea especially if there is bad blood. If she hasnt allowed you to see your child do you really think if you pop up she will just change her mind? A court order is so much better because she will have to abide by it or face the consequences. Good luck.
family,fikwugj,t1_fikguf6,1582488762.0,Oh yes. You dont want her to tell him information.
Infidelity,fikg1kq,t1_fik96y5,1582479664.0,"The healing process can take time. I agree with her you shouldnt be giving her ultimatums. But at the same time if she constantly thinking about it and living in those emotions she wont be able to move on. She should feel those emotions and acknowledge them but the dangerous part is submerging herself in those emotions. I would give her more time on telling her family and friends. I think you could look into couples therapy. Bring her the information and ask her what she thinks of them. If she is still not going though with the therapy you could start therapy by yourself. 

I know for me it is easier to forgive someone who seems remorseful and takes the steps on there own to change the circumstances or behavior that caused the problem to begin with. To me that says, ""hey I know I messed up. I did this or that. But I see the error in my ways and I am doing my best to be and do better."""
