from what OP said, they tried their very best to do as much as they could resulting in the best interest of themself and those around them. i think that's what's important here, aside from the landlord getting whatever's coming to him. i guess it's just a matter of how you respond and what you are even able to do in those types of scenarios."

ptsd,fg44qjo,t3_ewi1g4,1580496124.0,"i went through something really similar with my mom and my stepfather. i had to hear them fight all of the time and when it got quiet i knew he was strangling her. i saw him put so many marks on her and say so many things. i couldn't do anything but stay inside my room and listen to it, i'd wake up to it a lot. i told the police everything multiple times and they didn't do anything, because she never came forward even after they saw the marks. and still, she brought him back. she brought him back into our house and i told her he should go but she didn't listen to me. i tried to trust her again, i tried to believe maybe this time would be different and he'd be good but he didn't change, he was never going to.

i'm sorry this happened. i'm sorry he's there and things shouldn't be this way. having to watch something like that go past you when there's really nothing you can do to make it go away is excruciating. do what's best for you right now, you love her but need to put yourself first. take care of yourself. i hope things change, but until then you are right to set those boundaries. you are right to not let him in again. sometimes that's all you can do"

CPTSD,fg3dbzj,t3_ewet8l,1580478531.0,"all this is true about me. i just opened up about this last night with my partner actually, i don't necessarily hide what happened but i refuse to talk about the feelings involved with it to anyone other than my boyfriend. i'm not open about it. when i split, i go back to the same front i was holding up when i was being traumatized and i just recently realized this. i shut down. it feels like if i say anything true to what i'm really feeling, a dam will break in me and i won't be able to close it up when it's down. i don't want to burden those around me with everything i'm feeling, i understand it's a lot to take in and there's not really much you can do about it. i had a problem with emotional dumping on a person i was in a relationship with before and it became toxic for both of us, but i really didn't know any better. i had nowhere to put all of it. now i do know better but i feel like i'm almost too self-aware sometimes and it's hard to really be vulnerable with anybody other than my s.o, but a part of me has the urge to let everything go and not carry any shame or guit about it, like it might fix it, but i know that isn't the case and having boundaries is crucial

i'm grateful for the friends and relationship i have who i am able to open up a little bit about it to, even if it is only a little bit. im beginning therapy as soon as im able, and am slowly getting to a better place with me. the best to you:)"

depression,fdb36r4,t1_fd9ejbe,1578253228.0,"i see where you're coming from. it's important that those with depression, you and myself included, understand that there will always be someone who will value them and really see their worth. there will always be a time that will make you think i'm glad i didn't end it when i could've. depression is common but just as painful. with that being said, it's painful to not only us, but those who do care for us. i think that the person who posted's relationship with their boyfriend wasn't one that was uncaring, or lacked love and commitment. it did, after all, last 3 years. i think it's important to realize that being in a long term dedicated relationship with someone with depression is taxing on everyone, you give and give until there is nothing left and when you can't help that person any more, the pain is awful. you break both of your hearts. you want to save that person and you'd do just about anything to do that, you could love them so hard but in the end, you can't save that person from themself, not when you could end up hurting them in the process.
i think that by breaking up with this person, it might have showed more care in the long run and may have saved a lot more pain. having the one person who stuck with you through all that grief feels like the biggest abandonment, but the fact they stuck at all for that long meant they cared that much. best wishes"

CPTSD,f9u3krj,t3_ds1o5y,1575643743.0,"dissociating can look like a lot. it can be anything that takes you mentally out of something. when i was being traumatized, i started smoking pot to get out but it wasn't just weed, i did dabs constantly (i'm 15. my mother and stepdad allowed me to start about a year ago, but the trauma from him had me completely hooked. if you don't know, they're basically a way higher percentage of THC extracted from cannabis). i was out of the house as much as possible. that isn't in itself dissociating, but it's a form of it, a means to escape. when i dissociate now, my vision gets kinda fuzzy, i freeze up a lot, it's usually after or before an episode. whenever i'm reminded. i can communicate and act normal, but everything feels foreign. unreal, like i'm just floating through everything. kinda like that. you're there but you aren't, it's like you're watching everything go by. that's how it is for me."

CPTSD,f9owm5f,t1_f9o4t1q,1575515432.0,"not usually, but that was also sometimes to do on my end. after my first very toxic relationship with a guy who did have some familial trauma but was overall just an asshole with issues he hadn't worked out yet, it kind of set me up to be more distant and less willing to commit later, but it got waaay worse during my trauma. like i said most of the people i saw had trauma (guess it's what we attract lol), but none of them were anywhere near as toxic as him. they just weren't worth staying in due to personal differences, some things that made me uncomfortable and or lack of commitment on either end.
my current partner is a different story. we have a super open understanding relationship and we're both really suppirtive of each other, so it's a breath of fresh air for both of us, especially since this is the first one i've been in since my trauma happened. he has lots of familial trauma, as do i, with no sign of ptsd but it's clear he's been through it. it isn't made obvious, just in the way that you can feel it on someone when they've been through something like you.

 i feel a lot of it depends on the person and how they reacted to their trauma obviously, but most everyone who's experienced something or another is more apt to be a little more understanding and mature emotionally. a lot of it is just how much effort someone's willing to put in, right time right place type stuff. what really helped me find someone who's healthy for me and puts me up instead of vice versa is being friends with them before. if you have a great friendship dynamic and if it's actually healthy, regardless of trauma, you're way better off in a relationship together."
