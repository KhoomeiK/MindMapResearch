I was recently diagnosed after a manic episode. I cheated on my husband, did drugs, began partying hard, etc., you guys know the drill. Having lived it, I still have a hard time understanding why I didn’t stop myself. How I was myself but also not me. My very limited experience has shown me that if you haven’t physically lived through it, there’s no possible way you can understand it.  I don’t think it’s entirely their fault, because it’s not an easy thing to understand. 

But again, I have very limited experience. I got diagnosed about 6 months ago. And once I got out of the manic episode, with RX help. I immediately dug into books and research to try and understand what the heck just happened. It’s scary."
