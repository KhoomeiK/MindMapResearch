Noone and nothing waiting in the future, life that will end anyway will lose any meaning, right now it doesn't have any. Happiness is something taken away from me, so unwillingly I became the opposite of it. Like the counterweight, made to suffer. And that way, maybe when existence end, so will my pain."
selfharm,ewmh00h,t3_cox086,1565551435.0,"Selfharm is basically an addiction. Most of the time it's a coping mechanism: to deal with stress/loneliness/sadness or various different problems. It's mostly due to endorphine, that makes you not feel pain after the moment you cut, but makes the feeling into pleasure instead. It's relieving. Why people do it? It distracts from their problems, help them get along with it, even though it's not solving anything. Works the same as smoking or drugs to be honest and is addicting in the same way, it helps you feel something good that you wouldn't be able to feel otherwise. How to help? Be her friend. Talk with her, spent time with her and most importantly DON'T TREAT HER DIFFERENTLY. It never helps, just makes her feel like she's worse because she has personal problems. But she's not, everyone has some problems and deals with them in their own way. Cutting a lot of the time is just for the reason of feeling something, friendship helps in feeling something too. And don't worry too much, it's not suicidal most of the time, a suicidal person usually goes all-out when they try to harm themselves. You can ask her if she wants to talk about something on her mind, or just tell that you're here for her if she needs it sometime, but don't mention what you're thinking about, if she doesn't  want to talk, don't force her. A lot of the time selfharmers are afraid of their scars etc, because they think people will look down on them when they notice. So be better than that. Hope I helped."

Kuze Yun - ""Skeleton King"" 

In the underground there's a hidden kingdom,
Here lives everyone, who the living don't want. 
They are all skeletons, they're working all the time,
Fun isn't for them, they can't even laugh.
Their bodies are torn apart, their souls taken from them,
No hearths left for love, no nerves to feel, bones are the only thing left for them. 
Cast away from living, to this undead grounds, 
Ruled by a cruel king, wearing a crimson crown.
His cape made from shadows, consuming all the light, and in his hand, holding a giant cage. 
In this cage are souls of everyone under his rule, he takes them as a payment, for the grounds they use.
There are only 3 ways you can go from here, 
Go through the Dark gate, leave behind your bones, you'll go to oblivion, lose all that you own. 
Stay here, but remember, nothing will change, you'll never see light, with your soul cast away. 
Last path is to go back to the Overworld, but the road's not easy, you'll fail alone. 
Grab a hand if you're lucky, leave this place for now, but remember that your home here will always wait, in no time you'll be back again. 
Because after all, king always remains, he'll never forget ones who were on his land. 
You'll need luck up there, the living don't see us equal, for them we're just stack of bones, in no way seen as human. 
They refuse to accept us, deny us place up there, they will understand us, when they'll enter our domain. 
Our king will greet them, just like every other, after all they're new souls, waiting to be taken. 
I'll just stay here, witness their arival, here's my true place, on this dark, undead grounds. 
Because in the end there's just one question: 
Is there any place among the living, for this empty skeleton, from an undead kingdom?
