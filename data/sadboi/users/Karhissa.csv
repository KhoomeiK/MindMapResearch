If your little one some how makes it out of this alive, once they’re in your arms, pressed against your chest looking up at you. You’re going to feel the full force of what you’ve done, and you’re going to hate yourself. I hope they either get placed into a different home or you straighten the fuck up.

survivinginfidelity,f2uvj33,t3_dea9qq,1570431187.0,"Overall I’m proud that you’ve come to peace with your separation, and I’m going to lend my own opinion from the flip side.

I used to be her, depressed, unsure, and in desperate need of emotional (and physical) validation. Not something I could attain from one person, or that any one person had the mental or emotional capacity to keep up with. 

Years ago I was with someone for four years before (I felt) our relationship had run its course, and when that happened I freaked. Sought out the needs I had from someone else and once that came into light with my then partner, we separated and I stayed with the person I cheated on him with. After a while, I missed *his* comfort, not necessarily the relationship. Looking back, it was obviously best that we separated as I had done the unforgivable AND we simply were not right for each other anymore. 

She probably misses the comfort of having you around, because you became a habit. You are a safe place, even if she wasn’t getting *everything* she needed from you, you were *just enough* for her to keep around but not enough for her to not want more from someone else. 

This is purely my own experience and I’m not saying this is you OR her just that this situation is eerily similar to what I went through.

Mental health is important and I genuinely believe you should allow her to continue figuring this out on her own for a while, I know you two were close prior but watching her spiral will only make it harder for you to cut ties if that is needed later on. I put my ex through a whirlwind, and I’m certain he received emotional whiplash from putting up with me during our separation. I was not in the right headspace and the emotional attachment I had for him was still VERY strong. Just tread lightly, and keep boundaries very clear cut for her so that she knows not to cross them If you do decide to stick it out and help her. When my ex finally cut contact with me I was crushed, (I wasn’t able to fully move on with him still being around) but I’m grateful that he did now because years later we’re on speaking terms and all of that is water under the bridge. We were able to maintain a level of friendship due to the no contact that allowed me to sort myself out and grow on my own. Good luck, sorry for the long post, hope this gets better!"

I appreciate the feedback, I got lost in google and more times than not I stumbled across forums of women and men alike simply bashing the consumption of porn. Addiction is rough, I’m an addict (alcoholic) though I’ve been sober for a while, I completely understand the way it takes hold of you. 

I want to help him, and at first I did want to get angry and confront him in a way that wouldn’t have been productive. I want to try my best to let him know I’m with him, not against him but also let him know that it does in fact hurt me to an extent. We have a 5wo daughter and I know he loves us, he takes care of us and sacrifices a lot. 

I agree that it will consume the relationship, I’m already most literally losing sleep over this ordeal  besides the fact of having a newborn. Again, thank you for taking the time to comment, it really helps."

She shouldn’t be responsible for another adults shortcomings, you both need to sit down and really talk about this. 

Her knee jerk reaction to you expecting her to pay for what someone else did may have been irrational and I can agree that she went too far when she insulted your hobby, but it isn’t her fault that her brother is a dick. She could just be hurt by the fact that you are putting her brother’s mistake on her and she doesn’t find it fair so she’s being petty about it instead of talking to you like an adult.

All three of you need to sit down and figure out what the next move is, whether it be taking him to court or kicking him out. That’s up to you, but you shouldn’t expect her to pull $1200 out of her ass because her brother fucked up, if anything this will be a valuable lesson for her brother and maybe enough motivation to get him off of his ass and into a job."
