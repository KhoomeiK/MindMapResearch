They either expected it to be The Office in DC or a goofier AoS, but it was trying to be Better Off Ted, which sadly nobody gave a chance either.

2 would be Better Off Ted

3 is Ghosted, but like, with the original show-runner

4 is Abby's, another show people were **WAY** too critical about. It's like people nowadays can't enjoy something without ridiculous amounts of drama, when all I want some days is a nice light, dumb comedy."

I cancelled for a few reasons though. I can forgive rotating the movies out, but for like a year it seemed as though they only moved the same 12 movies in-and-out and every time they made a big deal about it, like we're supposed to be excited they brought Batman Begins back for a 4th time. I was happy when they added more comics, but I always had issues with reading them on the Roku app and honestly prefer physical comics, so the focus on making it a comic app doesn't draw me. My biggest gripe, though? The Community (not the users, well some of the users, mainly the structure), it's Rules, and the Mod team; those ""care packages"" seem very dirty to me (you only get them for being uber positive, and I always felt that dissuades the users from being critical of the service while also encouraging them to bandwagon against anyone that is critical), they ban cursing but shove ""Fuck"" with a hard **F** into every other line in the Original Content, and the Mods themselves are terrible at handling any sort of controversies or leaked news.

I was a day-one subscriber that joined on the premise that it would be a video service with a small, monthly rotating list of comics. I still lurk on the Watchtower once a month or so to see where the service is going and I still don't feel a need to come back (not a fan of Harley Quinn as a character, so not even slightly interested in her show.

Apparently he claimed to Thor that he was the Serpent from the prophecy, not the Midgard one. I haven't actually read Fear Itself, but I don't think it worked out too well for him."
Heroclix,fbhvq7f,t1_fbhvels,1576883579.0,"I've been dying to play The Serpent at it's full 1300 points more than Shuma at his full 1000 points. Only reason I even bought it was because my buddy collects mostly Asgardian figs, so I wanted to set up a Ragnarok game. Never have the time though."
Heroclix,fbhs3mr,t1_fbh9inf,1576880907.0,"I love the fig, the fact that his eye moves makes it easily in my top 10, but I've only ever gotten to use 2 of the Collosals in the picture; Thanos and Nebula. Most of the people I use to play with stopped or moved away, and the one left only ever has time for quick 200-300 games. I hope to get to use him one of these days."
Heroclix,fbhj3f2,t1_fbh9otg,1576874866.0,"From front to back, left to right, there's The Stranger, Jakar, Kronos, Hercules, Zeus, Ego-Prime, Black Lantern Anti-Moniter, Nebula, Thanos, Zombie Galactus, Shuma-Gorath, Living Tribunal, and The Serpent"

Honestly though, if we're going that far back, I'd probably be a jester that gets executed for making a tasteless joke about the King and/or Queen."
NintendoSwitch,fbfgifr,t1_fbdos9w,1576810019.0,I'll gladly admit I started DQ11 because of Hero in Smash quickly becoming one of my favorites.
deathbattle,fbc2kh5,t1_fbbk6ic,1576714106.0,"Right? What's the point of a fight to the death if one fighter uses a suicide move? I guess by their standards, Chiaotzu could actually win some fights."
DisneyPlus,faklt9l,t3_e9pgfe,1576169259.0,"Ok, we got The Child, now can we get some Recess characters?"
NintendoSwitch,fahkwj5,t3_d8wipk,1576087943.0,"I'm really bad at this game. Can't seem to beat a level without God Mode enabled. Gotta say though, with the cheats, it's the perfect Master Jedi game. There is nothing more satisfying than running into a room and making your lightsaber fly out at every enemy in sight. I also love how the spinning lightsaber will still reflect blaster fire."
