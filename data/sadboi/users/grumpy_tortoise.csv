Fitness,f87hfux,t3_dzgvjy,1574332844.0,"I also have had pushy family and friends. And I struggle with having an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise too. When I get in a rut I tell myself that I‚Äôll try again tomorrow or I‚Äôll try again my next meal. I try not to hold onto things because it‚Äôs overwhelming. As my mom has always told me, one day at a time. 

I also try not to do thing just to do them. For example instead of going to a gym, which I tried and hated, I rock climb and go on walks and occasionally runs. Same with food. Instead of focusing on the calories I will make up a meal that I like on paper then count calories. Then I weigh the options, I need these calories and nutrients in a day do I want to eat them now or later? I feel it‚Äôs more organic to listen to your body and think about things naturally instead of mechanically. Ie I have to do this and this. 

Once I‚Äôve gotten into a better place mentally I can start honing in on more solid goals. When I fall off the wagon I go back to square one and listen to what I need vs what others tell me I should be doing.

WomensHealth,f80z4he,t3_dyg08b,1574143124.0,"I am not a medical professional. 

It might just be because IUDs stop or slow periods. So dark brown blood usually means old blood. It might be just because it‚Äôs stopping/slowing your period down so by the time you ‚Äústart‚Äù your period it‚Äôs already finishing up. Does that make sense?

But you should always check with your medical provider if you have concerns. Especially when you try new medications or have something placed in your body (IUD). IUDs especially have very serious long term negative effects if something is wrong. Better safe than sorry."

climbharder,f7z4adx,t3_dy7mrk,1574105095.0,"If you‚Äôre worried about burnout vs technique sessions my advice is, don‚Äôt.

If the moves or holds look interesting/fun/challenging try it, even if you aren‚Äôt sure you can finish the route. Your technique will improve and so will your strength.

Keep very specific notes on everything, that way if they fire you because of it and you feel like you were wrongfully terminated you have evidence that could potential back you up in a appeal to the company or court case against it. 

Honestly though that‚Äôs really intense and it might not even get to that point but if something is wrong you should do something about it. Most companies have resources for reporting issues/complaints."
