Nurse,fpn7z98,t3_ge4wy7,1588753391.0,"Hey! If you want to make it work stand up for yourself, and do not let them being in power, it will make you feel worst.

I have tried for 6 months to make it work in a really bad Unit, all they used to do was pushing their job to myself and being real mean and unsupporting every time I would need help. I asked to be transfered, but in my country it doesnt really work like that. So I had to give up and resign...

But you know, you sound like a fighter, make it work if it doesnt, Just try to be transfered to another unit that you felt good over there working. 


Life is too short to be wasted going to work without a smile or fearing the next time you are going to be reported! 

Good luck and be brave!"

In my last shift on A&√â I have cut myself by accident in my 2nd finger with a bisturi and they made me work after being glued... and even told me that it was a lack of respect for my colleagues to go home.
