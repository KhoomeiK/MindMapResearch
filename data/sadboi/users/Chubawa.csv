bipolarart,f9h5iwz,t1_f9gaj7p,1575309412.0,Same for me. I usually paint abstract or extreme paintings. BUT last time I was manic I spent 3 hours painting my upstairs game room windows black!! Then I had a panic attack and then I took my Valium. LOL!
OCD,f9f55ur,t3_e4tam6,1575259838.0,"I believe there is more going on here than OCD. Have you ever been to a psychiatrist and explained these thoughts and actions to them. You may need to do so, because there is more out there that can help with these issues. I would give my honest opinion on what might be going on through advice, but I won‚Äôt share that. I would much rather a psychiatrist evaluate you and make the proper diagnosis and medication needed to help you feel at least somewhat normal. I really do hope you reach out for help. I really believe this is way more than OCD and can be treated. That‚Äôs all. ü§û"
bipolar,f21htw6,t3_d9vazq,1569872400.0,Yeah. I agree. Might be helpful. We fight over petty things and workout the harder things easily.
bipolar,f1loaxf,t1_f1lo8cs,1569561306.0,He gets angry and shuts me out. He doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with it. So I am left alone. All alone.
bipolar,erqcnip,t1_erqchzc,1561140266.0,Oh I definitely feel horrible for those poor guys having to work through this! I just lose myself sometimes...
bipolar,erjqfv4,t1_erizv7d,1560943012.0,"I have done this before in the past over stuff that doesn‚Äôt even matter. We just move on and talk about something else. He is my best and only friend. I cut loose all of my friends last year, because they just didn‚Äôt understand and wanted to offer me advice on my Bipolar. I honestly do not want to talk to anyone about it, excluding my doctor and husband (occasionally). I haven‚Äôt had an out burst in a long time. Thank goodness it is at home and not in public. Also, he just moves on to a new topic instead of coming back at me. He is too good to me. I am glad you and your husband were able to work things out. I‚Äôm not sure if it stems from my Bipolar or BPD (from childhood trauma). Either way it is unacceptable and I become so angry with myself or feel bad to the point I apologize."
bipolar,erc3llx,t1_erbwwl3,1560701861.0,"Oh wow! That sounds horrible! I have had issues getting my meds filled in the past and it feels like I am going to die! Just try being alone somewhere and and breathe in through your nose and out of tour mouth. Close your eyes and try to think of nothing. I know it is hard, but I just image a whit wall. I hope you get better soon!"
bipolar,erc3bfk,t1_erc1nro,1560701642.0,"I have been diagnosed for quite some time now. I do not talk about it any more since meds evened me out for now. I have decided that I may have Bipolar, but it does not define who I am. I also have Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD, and Severe Anxiety Disorder. I have all of these and learning to just accept them. I do find myself jealous often of ppl who are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but that can not be helped. I have these and I am learning how to live with it slowly. Plus I only leave my house once a week while he runs errands. üòû Seeing a Psych. is what has helped me most."
bipolar,erb084j,t1_er92ll2,1560657284.0,"It is hard living this way for me knowing there are so many ppl out there who do not have to struggle like we do every second of every day. Same ppl who have no idea about it but think they can fix it for you. I don‚Äôt wish this on ANYONE! My husband and I have it on both sides (not him thank goodness) and have decided against having children for MANY reasons with that being one of them. I can‚Äôt even dream of passing this on. My great grandmother, grandmother, and mother have all had to deal with this illness in different ways. It is just really hard sometimes."
bipolar,erazl1s,t1_er94299,1560656835.0,"I don‚Äôt seem to have too bad of side effects from it. I stopped half way through and remember nothing about my life at home. Talking memory loss!!!! May have helped my mood now, but wish I hadn‚Äôt started it. Was a stressful process."
bipolar,er91t3x,t3_c0z10c,1560615718.0,I have this problem too. I have just learned to accept it because my meds are finally working. My memory was really bad after suicide attempts and ECT. I do not recommend either. My memory isn‚Äôt as bad as before. I just sleep all the time. I stay sleepy! Ugh!
bipolar,er76bm4,t1_er71gd7,1560568413.0,That is pretty awesome! I love it!
bipolar,er70qzy,t3_c0qvbi,1560563298.0,"I am sorry if I am behind on this one, but what does this tattoo stand for? I really like it!"
bipolar,eqxzcez,t1_eqxxi12,1560375668.0,"It is always the people that know the least about Bipolar that want to give you advice like get over it, Bipolar is not real, or other extremely offensive comments. They also like to refer to my drugs as ‚Äúdope‚Äù and I do not need to take them. That makes me want to scream."
bipolar,eqxwoc5,t3_bzrfl0,1560374776.0,You are not a failure for feeling the way you do. Genetically we were unfortunately given this disorder and it takes over sometimes. Like it has the control and I am unable to make it stop. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. You just need to find a doctor that really knows their meds and can help you. You are very fortunate your therapist did not recommend going to the hospital. That doesn‚Äôt usually end so well. I hope you feel better and keep us posted.
bipolar,eqxvaet,t3_bzw846,1560374333.0,Yeah. I dumped 3 friends a few months ago. I just wanted to scream and run sometimes. Especially if they talked about me taking meds and my condition. I was like ‚Äúget away from me). I yell at my husband every once in a while to stop talking or leave me alone. I have gotten to where I just go to the bedroom and deal with my anger there. He doesn‚Äôt deserve that. It is my anger and frustration from depression.
bipolar,eqwokr2,t1_eqvf86o,1560359633.0,"I am glad someone can understand my position! I had my fun and social life in my 20‚Äôs, but after my mother (also bipolar) mysterious past away at 50, my life came to a stand still. I finished my bachelors and masters degrees and now I am unable to use them. During interviews I would become crazy manic and know it was a lost cause. Luckily my husband understands. I tried making a couple of friends last year, but they tried to get too close so I shut them out completely. Ugh! I think my doctor finally has me stable medicine wise, but I just feel safer alone with my art, poetry, and working on my book (slowly). My art is a major release for me."
bipolar,eqt0ykx,t3_bzj3cw,1560299150.0,"I use to do this, but now I just avoid people. I really only leave my house and dogs (only friends) is once a week when my husband does errands. I am stable on my meds finally and hope that lasts. I just can‚Äôt seem to get back into the social stream. Like I don‚Äôt want to at all, but know that for some reason I am suppose to."
