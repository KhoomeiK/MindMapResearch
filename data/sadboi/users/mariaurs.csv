AskReddit,fi9eua5,t3_f6y5ws,1582263504.0,"I go to sleep at 9:00, I'm eating the same stuff again and again (only cooked by myself), I get upset when my neighbors have parties, I don't take selfies, and when I do, it's that old people selfie with your face close to the camera and expressionless. I get excited about cleaning products, my bones hurt and so many others. I'm 24."

AskReddit,f36mypt,t3_dfw5c5,1570714676.0,"I had a religion teacher who wanted her daughter to be the first and best (her daughter was my classmate), so she gave me bad grades for bullshit questions. I used to learn 10 times more stuff than the other kids, because she would ask me some really absurd and deeply buried in the textbook or not even in the textbook stuff. The other kids would recite a prayer and get A's, while I would talk about the history of religion and get a C. One question she asked me was what was written on some guy's sword. I was 11 at the time and this continued until I wrote a request to be excused from the religion class."

Anxiety,eq21maj,t3_bwz29e,1559725687.0,"I went through some panic attacks, some alone, some with people around me. I think it's actually good that no one knew how to help, because it made me be motivated to help myself. Breathing is so important. Google breathing techniques. Concentrate on that. Remove yourself from places where sensorial overload could be a problem. You might want to try meditation and other relaxation techniques. I'm sure you've heard all this before, but they can improve your life a lot. Pay attention to your eating habbits, I'm mostly keto/carnivore, sugar can be a huge trigger, along with alcohol, coffee etc. So basically take good care of your body and be aware of your thoughts. I read a few books on the subject of mindfulness and that was helpful too."
