BPD,fk435fp,t3_fgckt6,1583852321.0,"me lmao. i’ve also been diagnosed with this thing cos my parents thought i was ADHD or something but nO turns out i have a higher iQ than average (like, higher than 120) but not enough to be a genius or anything, which makes me very lazy because i’ve never learned discipline cos everything was easy as long as i could remember enough... i’m in grade 11 and it’s the first time i’ve ever needed to study and i don’t know what to do i’m scared"
transED,fjtxe5t,t3_ff07np,1583611750.0,"it’s probably dysphoria messing with you, tho i’m not in your head and i can’t know how you feel or what you have. the most dangerous thing that could happen is you wanting to hurt yourself, whether it’d be by controlling your weight or sefharming... try to distract yourself and focus on the positive, and if it gets out of hand, seek professional help :)"

i live in very liberal part of canada, and hen i mean liberal i mean some guy in my squadron moved from BC to my city and is a homophobic and transphobic fucktard, and he was basically bullied into shutting the hell up about his pov..."
transED,fjtvb8c,t1_fjtsfj5,1583611253.0,"hum... idk i guess you’re somewhere healthcare isn’t quite easy access, but where i am it’s free and you can always search for a new doctor, a second opinion, a specialist, and it’s free (you just have to wait... which can be annoying but whatever). 

working out is so stressful for me too actually, i am so afraid people are looking at me and i’m so scared of doing things wrong, of smelling, of not wearing appropriate clothes, of looking stupid, of making sounds... maybe start by doing it at home, or just jogging or biking? listen to music, get yourself in the right mindset, and don’t start by trying to exercise every day: make yourself a schedule, start by once a week, then twice..."
transED,fjtr14e,t1_fjtpig5,1583610228.0,"well then idk i really don’t wanna encourage you in you unhealthy ness but i would have gone back to running, jogging and light exercises a while ago... and change fucking pcp??? what the hell"
GaySoundsShitposts,fjtqno6,t3_fes5mp,1583610116.0,"well it was kinda the same for me, but im ftm, so my family kinda convinced themselves that i wasn’t gonna get any surgeries, and since i had chosen a pretty androgynous name well my pronouns didn’t really matter. it was weird and awkward and uncomfortable, but we addressed it. even after two years, many of them can’t seem to understand that telling me that « i’m such a pretty girl » and « it’s such a waste » or that « i just need to find someone who would love me for me », but my close family knows and respect that :)"

BPD,fjpt96q,t1_fjpqvfs,1583560446.0,"it’s alright, take your time, and respect yourself through all your choices, but never leave bad feeling and unresolved issues in the past. i try to apologise to everyone and get all my relationships cleaned up before starting new ones... but that process can take time and effort"
BPD,fjpqo08,t3_fbuprx,1583558409.0,"listen i really can’t relate as i’ve mostly been in open relationships and most of my exes are very close friends. i actually find it so weird to share such a strong bond with someone to then yeet them out of your life? they’ve greatly influenced you, but that doesn’t mean it’s gonna last forever, and it won’t. one day, you guys just won’t be on the same page, won’t « vibe » like you used to, and if you try an ignore those issues you start to not handle each other and get into petty fights and whatnot. it’s hard to find the perfect person, and ut’s a lot of pressure too, so you shouldn’t try to aim for perfection and annihilate anything that doesn’t meet the expectations... and instead cherish relationships, even if they ended"
BPD,fjpq5to,t3_felyb8,1583557957.0,"i can totally relate, it’s so sudden and it takes the whole place in my head and suddenly everything points to it being the only and logical solution, and it’s so hard to snap out of it..."

ptsd,fg0x8q2,t1_fg0wp3t,1580416813.0,agreed! tho my therapist doesn’t tell me that she’s just being a bitch. i actually try to stay off drugs at school but yesterday i was at the cadets i was so high i was crying like a child alone in a random room because i wanted to go home and sleep...
