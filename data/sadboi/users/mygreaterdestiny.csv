AskAstrologers,fo0ni4k,t1_fo0m0d0,1587416309.0,"Ty! I didn’t know that and will definitely put more emphasis on house placement. Is it odd for people to have the same sign placement over the course of years? No matter what I won’t be assigning much significance to it but I couldn’t help but notice it and find it odd. What’s the significance of lunar return charts btw? Should they be looked at mostly in reference to solar return charts, or in conjunction with natal as well?"
AskAstrologers,fo0a99p,t1_fo06xmr,1587408900.0,I can say from my experience that it is felt! At least it was for me. Definitely felt like we were on the same mission and journey.

PMDD,fjoycb5,t1_fjow26t,1583537469.0,"No exactly. It makes sense to not have the same symptoms. If what the new research is putting out is true and pmdd could possibly be caused by brain inflammation it makes sense symptoms would change. Diet, exercise, stress, age, all play a role. I had very few pmdd symptoms this month. It could be that I ate salmon during ‘hell week’, I’ve been taking my vitamins, getting lots of sleep and exercise, etc. 
I personally can’t relate to the obsessing in terms of having imaginary conversations and attributing that to pmdd. I’ve done that since I was a child and not menstruating yet."

I would try getting water that has magnesium in it (I can message you a brand if you’d like, just have to look for it) because it’s good for you and can lower pmdd symptoms. I would say try getting edibles. Find a brand you like. I suggest using Weedmaps. If you live in a legal state get a rec or if you’re 21 you don’t need one. Look at different shops options and then look up reviews for what you like. I like the Kanha brand and also Efex and kushy punch. They’re reliable and strong. I usually only need 5mg so I just cut up the 10mg gummy. But I mostly use them for sleep"

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fbcmsky,t1_fbcknu4,1576727752.0,Exactly. We are no longer in contact and it was bothering me a lot today so I thought I would ask. Kind of beating myself up for not asking more questions and getting all the answers before everything ended. I never wish the kind of pain infidelity causes on anyone. It’s crazy how your sanity ends up in the hands of the person who hurt you the most and they have the answers to what was really going on. So fucked up
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fbc98hs,t1_fbc6vvy,1576718696.0,"Thank you! I think you’re right about that. Everyone has a different way of dealing with this but I know that they probably didn’t use condoms, and he probably kissed her. It’s more the disrespect and cowardice that he couldn’t even tell me the truth. Infidelity is awful. We are no longer together and on speaking terms. I don’t want this person in my life ever again because of how invalidating they were and how awful they made me feel about myself, but the pain of the infidelity and all the lies an betrayal is so so difficult to move past, it broke my psyche when I found out I was so infuriated"
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fbc905q,t1_fbc6rg7,1576718539.0,"I think the same, it’s just that his story didn’t make sense ya know? Like how would you remember not kissing her if you didn’t ‘remember everything’ because you were ‘so drunk’? I think he was trying to tell the truth in a way that wouldn’t hurt me as much and still trying to look like he wasn’t that bad of a guy. He has a super bad habit of minimizing his actions and distancing himself from his own behaviors because he doesn’t like to feel like a bad guy because of all the shame that comes with. I was feeling really emotional when I made this post. It sucks but I have to come to terms with the fact that I’ll never the full truth (we don’t talk anymore). It’s really difficult for me, it’s like a wound I don’t know how to stop poking, not knowing the whole truth"

survivorsofabuse,f96v9vn,t3_e3nzfn,1575152872.0,"I have adhd as well and I’m learning to deal with this anger too. It’s awful because my abuser would make me feel bad for being angry and tell me that I was a bad person and there was nothing good about me. I hate that his thoughts stuck to my subconscious because when I do feel angry I feel bad because it’s like ‘he’s right, I do have anger issues’ then I get angry and think ‘well I’m angry at HIM because he did this to me’ and then it’s just a huge spiral of hate. He’s off living in a new state, in a new church where he’s super involved and everyone seems to love him. It’s infuriating that he abused me, got away with it and then now is starting off new. And not only that, because he’s doing well and said he’s sorry that I experienced that side of him it makes me want to gaslight myself and feel like I’m the bad guy because obviously if he was the bad guy he wouldn’t be doing well. And then i get angry all over again that I’m traumatized. 
So what helps: 
Meditation for 15 minutes on gratitude and what I love about myself 
Talking myself through my emotions and why I feel them and self soothing 
Writing what I feel and thinking down and songwriting 
Deciding that I can’t get back the past. I shouldn’t compare my life to his, and I need to focus on what I need to do for myself. This doesn’t actually help the anger but it does help me get my life together. 
Spending time with friends and going out 
Making new memories 
Being outside. I love to garden so that helps. 
Be around animals and children if possible 
Reminding myself that I still have the rest of my life and if I let go of seeking revenge and wanting them to suffer then I can move forward almost unscathed from this 
Forgiveness is really difficult for me but I’m trying to, for myself. The anger eats me alive and it’s not fair to me. What happened isn’t fair. Life isn’t fair. I can either push myself to keep going or I can die stuck and angry. 
Let yourself be angry but also gain the skills it takes to self soothe. 
I hate that I was abused and I’m sure you hate it too. If you were strong enough to get through that you’re strong enough to push past the anger and get your life back. Don’t give up on yourself"

Someone can care and then end up treating you badly because they know you’ve put up with it before. I’m not saying your new partner is like this but just to use discernment and take things slow. They should be understanding that it’s difficult for you to trust them. If they make you feel bad that you don’t trust them easily then that’s a bad sign. But if theyre just hurt and not making you feel bad, then that seems okay and normal.

I don’t feel bad about it at all because it’s the truth and being honest about the experience feels great and empowering"
dating_advice,extbcp6,t3_cu9qq8,1566565839.0,"It depends on the type of people you date and your age tbh. Everyone is saying yes, but it really just depends. Not everyone will be interested in that"
relationship_advice,ex49buy,t1_ex28hxz,1566001022.0,Sounds just like my narc ex !
NarcissisticAbuse,ewy34pq,t1_ewxxytg,1565873679.0,"Wowwwww that is exactly what I think about with my nex! The fact that he was soooo charming and amazing to everyone else is so heartbreaking. I wish I experienced the version of him that he shows everyone else. I would think the same thing, ‘what if he actually treats someone else how I wanted to be treated all along’ it’s terrible. But I know something better is in store and I try not to think like that anymore"
BreakUps,ew2mu5g,t3_cmb50n,1565050692.0," I swear I have such a victim mentality :/ that might be because there was domestic violence and abuse in my relationship but it’s like I can’t let go of the pain. I want to make him pay but I know it’s too late for that. I hate that I got played and hurt so much, lied to and cheated on. Moving on is the logical decision but for some reason I feel like I can’t/ it’s sooo difficult"
spirituality,evxb5eu,t3_clqy6o,1564887067.0,"A lot of spiritualists I think forget that we are all still at the mercy of evolution and nature. The world is incredibly cruel and savage, by design. Nothing is ever fair and everyone has to choose to either make the best of their situation or give up"
NarcissisticAbuse,evx1ya8,t3_clhcx9,1564879596.0,My nex would literally tell me to stop crying and to stop trying to manipulate him with my tears. He would get visibly upset and act as if I was being dramatic. So heartless!! I hate him
BreakUps,evwi5g7,t3_cllwqy,1564864698.0,My friend told me: if it’s getting you farther away from you ex than it’s a good thing. If it’s getting you closer to your ex than it’s a bad thing. It’s okay if you’re journaling a lot and thinking about your ex if you’re processing it out of your system. If you find yourself pining for them and wanting the past back than it’s getting you close to them
datingoverthirty,eve3igm,t1_eve2yc4,1564454547.0,"I saw your comment on another post and was curious about your sign. Women love Aries men, they are usually the most charming regardless of how they feel internally. Seems like you got a lot of good advice here though. If a pattern continues in your life, it’s not the women it’s you. Good luck to you"
datingoverthirty,eve2r27,t3_celz23,1564453954.0,This is an old post now and will get downvoted but are you a libra?
askwomenadvice,evbnul5,t3_civnik,1564385470.0,He sounds so selfish and insensitive and awful ! Break up with him
BreakUps,evbmgk5,t3_cj3ck2,1564383584.0,Thank you
BreakUps,euulqk0,t1_eushuky,1564046641.0,"Thank you. I did think that that was the case. I was always feeling like because I understood why he was that way that maybe he wasn’t a narcissist, if that makes any sense. But yea he probably is. He cared about his reputation I think more than anything. Because he wants power and thinks that he should be in charge. The worst part is that he’s Christian, and I believe he will end up in a position of power. Because of the way that Christianity works, I could tell people about his behavior but it doesn’t matter, because he can say that is redeemed and not like that and people would love him even more for being ‘honest’"
cheating_stories,eurutlm,t1_eukzznx,1563999252.0,"Yeah just like you said it’s about self preservation. From what he told me it was because of shame, and that he also wanted things to still work out, he was being selfish. But I doubt he would have wanted me if I did that to him, ya know? Why did you cheat on someone a couple of years ago if you don’t mind me asking? And was it easy to get away with, like how you said? I feel like it definitely could be but I’ve never thought about it much"
cheating_stories,euru0un,t1_eurt4n2,1563998942.0,"So let’s say someone gets cheated on. Instead of breaking up with the person, they immediately find someone to cheat on their partner with, to spite them and for justice, etc. that’s what I meant. I’ve seen a lot of stories where people will do this, or even pretend they’ve forgiven the person and then they will cheat, just to hurt them even more."
BreakUps,eurrboj,t3_ch7yyn,1563997901.0,"My ex checked off some boxes for sure. We had a great and instant connection. But I think what’s kept me hung up on him is that I compare myself to him, he had qualities that I want for myself. He’s charming, charismatic, gregarious, people looooove him. But behind closed doors he was abusive, cheated on me, and had no emotional control. So no, even if people love him, it doesn’t mean that I should regret losing him and pushing him out of my life. Difficult to see that all the time though"
cheating_stories,eurqhq7,t1_euqnccf,1563997584.0,"Same! What I learned is to not listen to a persons words but their actions. My ex could talk his way out of almost anything, and he would always say that he would never be like his cheating father. Well he hated his father so much he became him. The accusations in mine were so out of left field but helped me learn that he had a type (basically just unhappy women who were open to hooking up on the low) and it helped me figure out that it was just projection"
cheating_stories,eurq136,t1_euo4hyz,1563997402.0,They might have actually thought cheating is terrible. But then they might have thought terrible thoughts about themselves ya know? Since cheating is based on insecurity. Maybe some of these people got cheated on and then didn’t deal with their insecurities and then became cheaters themselves :/ I’ve heard of a lot of people even staying in a relationship just long enough to cheat on their partners after they get cheated on. It’s crazy how common it is
cheating_stories,eurp072,t1_eumlwwb,1563997009.0,"This sounds just like my ex. He got really comfortable with the name calling, not sure the psychological reason behind that, that’s just straight up verbal abuse and being an asshole. He was the one cheating with women who he thought of as sluts and then calling me one"
cheating_stories,eurokpd,t1_eup52yz,1563996843.0,"Went through the same thing as well. It went on for about a year of him constantly accusing me, which is sad, because that means he was constantly wanting to cheat and flirt, which he would on occasion and then deny, even though it felt very obvious to me. He kept me under his thumb through manipulation as well, because I knew that I was a loyal person. I felt that eventually he would see that. Never letting that happen again, and it’s great that your new partner doesn’t do that, it’s such damaging behavior"
cheating_stories,euiwyjw,t1_euhy2ia,1563857132.0,"It seems like you’re just trying to find a way to not deal with this, which is honestly typical cheater behavior. It’s cowardly and you know it. Of course it’s your place to tell him because you are involved in the mess, you just don’t want to have to deal with it. Stop lying to yourself that it’s not your place"
