BipolarReddit,f0db08w,t3_d42sua,1568551786.0,"I’m dyslexic. It’s gotten really bad over the years, especially since I’ve been out of school. I sound like a freaking 3rd grader when I read out loud because my words are just so jumbled all the time. Lol"

BipolarReddit,f0cvod0,t3_cvhqxk,1568545915.0,"I was just diagnosed with bipolar & she asked me if I had been on any SSRIs.

I had a horrible reaction to Prozac. I felt like I was in a dream. I was hysterically crying and really just lost my shit. It was only week 2, too. 

I was on lexapro & my heart started racing and I legit thought I was going to die. 

I also tried Zoloft and it made me miss time. 

I was trying to be treated for anxiety. My psychiatrist told me people with bipolar disorder will usually react very negatively to SSRIs.

She wants to put me on a low dose of an SSRI eventually because I have extreme OCD-excessive thoughts but she said I have to be 100% stable before she will add another in."
Narcolepsy,ew66qj0,t3_cmkmp8,1565156017.0,I had mine yesterday & I’m the most anxious person ever. I fell into my weird sleep but awake lumbar very easily. I can few my body go into REM sleep so I’d just relax even more when I flet it coming. I sleep during every nap & I had to do 5 naps total.
Narcolepsy,ew66ju6,t3_cmtwvj,1565155814.0,"So I just had my sleep study and MLST last night & today. 

Went in just testing for sleep apena but the fact that I was super restless the whole time and going from asleep to awake super fast was kind of concerning for them. I never even thought I had narcolepsy until I was sitting in the chair getting hooked up to all the wires and I kept dozing off 😂😂 

Anyway, I had to take 5 naps today & I fell asleep during each and every one of them within the first 5-10 mins and “normal” people take longer than that. I’m 99% sure I have it. It would explain how I have repeated slew paralysis almost every night, I feel so weird all day long & the fact that my body just randomly goes numb.

There’s really no tips on how to sleep, I had the tech turn off every light & for the MLST I was allowed to sleep in whichever position I was comfortable in. 

Took 5 naps and still came home and passed out at 8pm 😂"
