I don’t know if any free therapy resources but most places are offering tele-therapy. You could try psychologytoday.com or goodtherapy.org to find a therapist in your area. I know that psychology today offers a feature where it says enter a therapist is accepting new clients and whether they are offering tele-therapy sessions. 

If you have health insurance, some insurance plans are waiving fees so you can check with your plan if they are doing that."
askatherapist,fqlv3r0,t1_fqktr7l,1589466626.0,"Maybe advertising sites can vet the therapist more deeply? I know no one can force them to, but it’s an idea. For example I’m listed on 3 advertising sites, GoodTherapy.org, PsychologyToday.com and Lighthouse.lgbt. Now good therapy and psychology today verify the legitimacy of your license, as they should but that’s all they do. Anything on the site like specialties and skills in certain treatment modalities is on the therapist to complete without any oversight. Lighthouse.lgbt, is a site to find lgbt specialized medical and mental health providers. The site started in NYC and expanded to other areas as often these things do. But, to be listed on this site they interview you and do reassessments every 3 years to check to see what level of competency you have in working with the LGBTQ+ community and if you’ve had any trainings or certifications in the field. This is how they make sure that every provider listed on the site is who they say they are and have the skills they claim to have."

If the NYC stay at home order goes into June then I think insurances will continue the tele-medicine coverage. Typically only people with specific insurance plans can access telemedicine/teletherapy and even with that they usually ask individuals to pay extra fees to access these services, additionally they usually pay providers less money for these services."

Most therapists don’t just deliver information to patients but the child doesn’t have to sign a consent for the therapist to speak to their parents about their case.
askatherapist,fpyo94l,t3_gg9r6r,1589007061.0,"everything should be confidential regardless of age except if the child is in danger or in danger of hurting others (same confidentiality as with adults). HOWEVER, up through age 12 parents can ask therapists for information and there usually is more freedom in communication. After age 12 there is more confidentiality. At age 12 children can seek therapy without parental consent but the therapist should get parent involved except if the child would be in danger if parents knew they were in treatment."

MentalHealthProviders,fpkx9sx,t1_fpktxc9,1588702631.0,"Thanks. Mainly I was asking because I got into a bit of a back and forth with a health insurance quality insurance person about this. Unmarried couple, see them as a couple but bill HIS insurance which is a different insurance company than HERS. She has Medicaid managed plan and they do random quality assurance audits and one of his critiques is that I wasn’t billing couples sessions even though I say in the notes that state that certain issues were addressed in couples. I don’t want to argue with the insurance QA person but he was being ridiculous. When they do these audits they pick sometimes a 3 -6 month time frame of session notes and treatment plans etc but where it said couples treatment was being billed under his insurance was in notes before the period they were asking for. Therapeutically it made sense to meet with her individually and also in couples. So I was billing her 90834/90837 and billing him the 90847s. QA guy was being stubborn and refusing to back down about how couples therapy was indicated and why wasn’t I seeing her in couples, even when I told him I was just not using her insurance. So I wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing something."

MentalHealthProviders,fmqusqx,t1_fmqdcon,1586307517.0,"You’re right I think I’m asking couple questions in this post. I was writing this post in between sessions right after a fairly new client (2nd session) asked me if I identify as queer, so it wasn’t as thought out as I would have liked.

Questions:

1. Is really for my own self reflection/therapy sessions which is to explore my own sexuality and owning it. Any bi subreddits you recommend? 


2. What I meant to ask is. Should I reveal my sexuality to clients? I’m afraid saying I’m heterosexual leaning or queer-ish or something to that affect sounds like I am ill equipped to treat them because I haven’t figured out my own shit. Saying I’m heterosexual makes me fear that their biases will have me lose clients and also write off important things I have to say just because I’m a cis straight woman. Saying I’m queer feels disingenuous at this time in my life and I feel guilt co-opting a community I don’t really belong too and even though no one but I would know, I feel like I would be jumping on the queer bandwagon."

MentalHealthProviders,fl3qp67,t3_f64nkz,1584795264.0,"Not sure if you still want replies to this but I’m a LMHC. And planning on getting a PsyD. I think first you need to evaluate why you want the PsyD. I was just reading an article about this a few weeks ago. But basically if you want to do counseling a masters level is sufficient. I may be partial but I really prefer mental health counseling degrees over MSW if you definitely want to be just a therapist. A MSW prepares you to be a social worker and yes there are some counseling courses but a degree in counseling is all about counseling. Going back to the PsyD, the article I was reading basically said that doctorates are expensive and unless you want to be a professor, do extensive research or do psychological testing the ROI won’t be there. If you get your masters in mental in counseling then you can work right away and get your clinical hours, sit for your national licensing exam, get your license and then go back to school for a PsyD. Or don’t go back to school and live a great life as an LMHC.

So why do you want your PsyD?"
MentalHealthProviders,fl3q4d8,t3_fm7nja,1584794714.0,"Not sure what platform your boss is having you use but this telesessions platform has a lot of options for children like interactive white boards, screen sharing (for work pages etc), it has built in games. 

https://www.theraplatform.com/features/hipaa-compliant-video-conferencing

However if that’s not an option maybe speaking to the parents before hand to get items ready for the therapy appointment. Like play doh or certain games etc. also utilize https://www.therapistaid.com/ for online worksheets. 

Not sure if it’s too late for this but maybe seeing if you or a few clinicians can stop by your office and create therapy packages that the parents can pick up so the kids are ready for their sessions. These packages can have clay or colored pencils or paints or worksheet or whatever in them. Parents were doing that last week picking up school supplies for kids doing distance learning. 

Just a few ideas."

3) I was in a sticky financial situation and was not in a place to pursue legal action. Due to lack of finances and needing to work I had to stop PT early. 

4)it’s 2020, the accident happens on July 10, 2010 and I still have pain in my neck, should and arm, weakness in my arm.
