I didn’t like Jess because he was problematic, I loved him so much more when he grew up and became what he wanted to be. He really changed a lot and I wish they could of re-end up together though. 

I liked dean for the first two seasons. But he was always a family man. Wanted the slow paced family and kids life. That was complete opposite of Rory.  I really disliked him when he cheated on Lindsey with Rory. I hated that with my every being. 

I’m Logan all the way but wish grown up Jess and Rory tried again"

GilmoreGirls,fq6d39t,t1_fq5wq7k,1589129191.0,"That’s completely true an all yes. But how they went about everything was just get like they went away from the characters goals, hopes and overall their personality. But we all have different opinions. I completely agree with you though. It would be boring if they got everything they wanted. But there were just some major things off with the revival that were completely uncharacteristic. Like Lorelai trying to find herself on nature. She hated camping, fishing and anything that had to do with bugs. 

I think we all just had different hopes and ideas for what the revival would be. As well as just how things would in seasons 7."
GilmoreGirls,fq5u7fm,t1_fq5clpz,1589117569.0,"These are reasons I honestly just hate seasons 5-7 and the revival. Seasons 5 is good but honestly just starts going down hill from that season. 

I understand that not all shows and movies can have happy endings. I totally get that. But when you ruin the trueness of the characters by trying to add a little unexpected drama and plot twists, it’s just stupid. 

Revival was not what I was expecting and I’ve only watched is once, and will probably never again watch it. They just didn’t seem like the characters they were originally. It wasn’t the same."

But I think anxiety and anxiety when I sleep doesn’t help. My Apple Watch has recorded multiple times of my heart rate getting up to 180 and it’s only a spike when I get anxious because once I’m anxious I do breathing methods to help myself so it tends to go down pretty fast. My watch has only caught one time when it’s gone up and stayed up. My doctors said my heart if healthy and all my blood test are super healthy. I’m just wondering if any of you have had this problem. The highest my heart with go up to on average is 140, but there’s been a few times it’s gone up way higher than that. But also that happens when I’m coming out of sleeping, I’m a light sleep so I scare awake so easily. I hope one of you guys replies because I know this post if very hold"

Anxietyhelp,fo0xnc4,t3_g4vw1u,1587421713.0,"You are not alone in this. 

My anxiety started giving me a irregular heart beat problems, or so I thought. It was really just my heart rate speeding up due to anxiety and my anxiety making me feel like something was wrong when there really wasn’t. 

Went to the doctor, they did a lot of test and everything came back A-Okay. I have a Apple Watch that shows me my heart rate and what not. The only time it get high is when I’m having a panic attack. 

I am beyond terrified of health things. My anxiety is usually at its worst when I think of these things. My family history has a few different things like cancers and heart problems ( heart problems are on the men on my dads side of the family ) but all of it still scares me a lot. 

When they ran a bunch of tests, they also looked at my blood work and everything came back perfect and healthy. However, I kept spiraling down a hole of “What if’s.” 
What if they missed something 
What if I have cancer and it just didn’t show up 
What if this, what if that. I about drove my mother crazy with all my questions and anxieties on these things.  I am 20 years old btw. 

You’re honestly not alone, health is very scary. There’s a lot of scary things out there. But there’s also things that comfort me. The chances of these things happening at your age are slim to none. A big majority of these things are manageable with medications and different diets and what not. Medicine has come incredibly far. These things don’t automatically stop my panic, but they help me cope a little bit better. I still panic over all of these scary things. But doing things to distract yourself and cope with it all helps. 

I will stop and just have myself breathe. Or I’ll watch a Disney movie or YouTube video. I’ll talk to someone about it. It stops me from spiraling into a completely black hole. 

Also I don’t look things up on Google. I’ve learned my lesson because it just causes more panic. Google isn’t a doctor and it usually comes up with worse case scenarios and things that you don’t even have. 

I hope you find ways to cope with it and that you know your not alone. You can message me anytime ☺️"

Anxiety,fnpcib3,t3_g2yamz,1587143093.0,"I can absolutely relate to this too.

My siblings used to make fun of me and actually still do to this day. When I was around 8-9 years old I had my first ever major panic attack. 
It was New Year’s Eve and I choked on a piece of pop corn chicken and it really scared me. After that I kept having panic attacks thinking I was choking. It was all because I was scared of that situation and having panic attacks make it hard to breathe and I had no idea what was going on. My siblings think that incident is so funny to this day which makes me really sad. 

My anxiety and depression also made me not ever want to go to school in middle school. I was being severely bullied, so everyday I was terrified to go to school. I would straight up make myself puke to try and get out of going because I was so anxious to be there. On school nights my anxiety would keep me up because I was worried on what people would do or say next to me. 

You are absolutely not alone, and it’s sucks that our childhood selves has to even go through things like that."

What I do is;
Watch YouTube videos
Try to focus on breathing, spending 2-5 minutes taking deep breaths, ( it regulates your heart rate and helps come anxiety a bit) 
Watching my favorite tv show/ happy movie (Disney is helps a lot) 
Talking to my mom/a friend 

You’re never alone"
