BipolarReddit,fjr1rsy,t3_fes7j2,1583580439.0,"I feel you. After my psychotic episode, I went straight into major depression and it tool me 3-4 months to get up. I'm mostly normal these days but I am leaning towards depression. I take my meds, I have a therapist and psychiatrist but still I can show some depressive symptoms. I don't know what to do and I sometimes lose my hope. 

I guess the best advice would be not losing hope and let depression past. All we need is time. 

I hope this helps ðŸŒ¸"
BipolarReddit,fixc62l,t3_fa9vfi,1582817426.0,"I have been there, I understand your dad especially when I think about my depressed time. You can't really force him to do tunings as it doesn't work like that. When you are depressed, you truly don't want to do anything and you can't just so it. You can't force yourself to do anything. 

For me, I spent my 3 months in a bed. I had suicidal thoughts and it seemed like it will never end. Truth is, it ends. Your dad will get better. He just needs more time and right medication. This illness is also related with biology. Your brain chemistry needs to be in a correct balance so that you can do everyday things.

Please support him as best as you could. I know you live in an individualistic society but there is nothing wrong to feel responsible for your dad in these hard times. He will get over it. 

I hope the best for you."
BipolarReddit,fgidtf5,t3_eygv9l,1580818236.0,"I also had psychotic outbreak and went into major depression afterwards. I was prescribed olanzapine 20mg, which I used for 7-8 months then it was cut down to 10mg, then 5mg. I never gave up that medication which has affect on depression as well. 

My major depression lasted for more than 3 months. I basically didn't get out of the bed, had problems with personal hygiene and my energy was basically non existent. I had suicidal thoughts but eventually the depressive period ended.

Please don't be hard on yourself. What you are experiencing is totally normal and with correct medication, you will overcome it. You just need time. We fucked up our brains during psychosis and it needs time to re-calibrate. 

Hope this helps."

Combined with anxiety, I basically don't have any self esteem. However, I don't want to lose this opportunity either and I want to succeed. Then here comes the question, what if I wouldn't succeed?

I'm in IT field and I haven't lost my coding skills. I am capable of learning new languages and concepts. However, there are some things that I don't want to do in this job and it gives me stress. Maybe I'm forgetting that I will have team mates who will help me when I'm stuck. I just don't know the team dynamics. My previous job was hell, I was exposed to too much stress and eventually I had an episode. I relate to this experience and my anxiety fires."

I'm not sure if it was a hypomania as my sleep pattern was okay, I slept as usual (~11 hours), I didn't spend much and I didn't have energy for any other activity. I just picked one thing and did it excessively. Does this count for hypomania?

I have a psychiatrist but I don't have a therapist. I don't because I'm not sure if it will help with this empty feeling. I'm on olanzapine, sertraline and lithium for a long time."

I don't have any personal issues currently. I'm back to my family's and I don't have any responsibility at all.

I want them to surface and fix them. I also experienced a major manic psychotic episode. I still remember some parts and they are all my own serious problems. I think somebody needs to listen to me and guide me to be whole again.

The reason I am suspicious with the technique is that it's still considered experimental. It may be due to the fact that current meta around the field is psychoanalysis. Gestalt is existential and my therapist has a PhD in philosophy, and master's degree in psychology.

Researching around to topic made me realize that I actually have trust issues. I have basically read everything I could about the therapist and the technique. I try to answer whether this will be useful to me or not. Maybe I should stop and give it a try. Worst case is I will just lose a little bit of money.

edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and I have been taking my medication regularly. I now feel stable and ready for some therapy"

bipolar,ezjiclf,t1_ezjhxkx,1567945131.0,Seems like those times with your hobbies are the signs of hypomanic / manic episode. Overspending or buying shit you don't actually need is one of them as well. Get well soon and try to get an earlier appointment with your doctor.

Although self diagnosis can be misleading, if you have racing thoughts and change of sleeping pattern, it can be a sign. 

Sleep is the most important part. Please sleep well and on time. When I had my psychotic episode, I didn't even know if I slept or not. At least you are self aware of your situation. If things can get out of control, you can always go to emergency."

bipolar,ezfip5y,t3_d0yp7p,1567878179.0,I experienced a manic psychotic episode and later major depression. It's a textbook bipolar I. I can say that medication keeps me in check to some extend. I think you may be mistaken on the fact that they charge us expensive meds for misdiagnosis. It's common to not accept the diagnosis at first. All I can say that you may want to try a different doctor if you feel like you are misdiagnosed.

Police came and they handcuffed me from behind. I was screaming ""help me"" all the time when this was happening. I don't remember the rest, whether I was sent to the police station first or psych ward. Last thing I remember is that I was in a van, with a really small space.
