depression,focvjue,t3_g6jgq0,1587676450.0,"I know your anguish. I feel it too. I also want you to know how proud I am of you for fighting on. Things like washing your face brushing your teeth, or making your bed are incredibly difficult to do when despair is all you can feel.

I also try to ""out run"" depression. But it's always there, like a cloud of silent black flies waiting to swarm my head as soon as I stop.

I hesitate to offer advice, because we have all heard it before. It's one of the reasons I don't really share my depression with anyone. Everyone thinks it should be easy to ""fix"". But recently, I started meditating on just breathing. It's not a cure, but for the few moments I am doing it, I am doing it, I don't have to try and outrun depression.

Edit: changed a word."
socialskills,focrfhw,t3_g6n2od,1587674850.0,"I'm the same way, mainly because I don't actually LET people get too close. I think relationships are reciprocal. You have to give what you expect in return. For me, I'm just not willing to put that much energy into relationships. I have a hard time listening to people, and I rarely initiate or invite people to go do things.  After a while, people move on. It's kind of like slow-mo ghosting.

However, I love meeting and talking with completely random strangers. That way I don't have to worry about remembering their names!"
