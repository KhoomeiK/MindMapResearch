You need to find friends you actually like and get a long with. If you feel taxed more then the eh, I don't want to do this but hey screw it. But the 'friend(s)' are actually more of a burden, they are really just people making you not feel alone but that doesn't mean they are having a positive impact on your general overall happiness. 

One of my true friends once told me ""wolves need to stick with the wolves, let the sheep play with the others.""

Essentially, you need to find your pack. A friend or group of friends you feel like you NATURALLY click with. May not happen at first but people you can just flow with should be your main concern. Finding these people is hard but doable."
