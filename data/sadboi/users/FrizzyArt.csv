IdiotsNearlyDying,fjbokpv,t3_fca0mg,1583197983.0,"Knocked down trees all the time as a kid collecting firewood to heat our house.  You can knock down a pretty sturdy dead tree by pushing on it and working with the rocking motion created.  Push, let it rock back toward you and push as it rocks away from you.  Incrementally increase the strength of your push each time.  Eventually it will fall over away from you.  Just be patient and work with it and be prepared to move if it does fall towards you."

depression,excxnb7,t3_cs2ogj,1566162145.0,"I live for my kids. I know how important my parents are to me even though they are ""sick"" and my childhood wasn't that great.  I still would be lost without them.  I can't hurt my kids by leaving them.  Their Dad is a very sick and mean man so they have only me.  I nearly succeeded in suicide 5 years ago and seeing the devastating effect that had really opened my eyes to just how important I am to them even with all the mistakes I have made raising them.  My daughter told me last month that I am her idol.   WOW!!   I must see this through.  My youngest will graduate high school in 4 years.  I have until then to find success in a career and or new love interest.  I intend to work very hard toward these goals as they will sustain me when my kids have moved out.  I know depression is ultimately a fatal condition.  Much like a cancer of my psyche but I will try to fight it with everything I can muster.  I will not sit back and let destroy me without waging a battle."
AbruptChaos,ex1ionc,t3_cqwo5y,1565946584.0,He looks like he has CP.  You’re ridiculing a disabled guy.  He’s not drunk.
depression,ewusm89,t3_cpvwhh,1565790671.0,I find it especially hard when sharing in groups for alcoholics.   I quit drinking and thus started following those groups for support.   When I’m having a rough time I get handed a lot of judgement for not being in AA and working my program right.   They don’t understand that my depression is not the result of my addiction but it’s actually the other way around.   My addictions are a symptom of my depression.   When my depression is under control I have no need for using and no desire to.   I don’t drink primarily because it drives my depression out of control.
