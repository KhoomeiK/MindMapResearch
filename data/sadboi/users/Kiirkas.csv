CPTSD,fqo9532,t3_gjsqmu,1589510148.0,"I resisted guided meditation for a long time, and in many ways I still do. I don't like being told what to do, especially if I'm not yet ready to do it.

I entered DBT four years ago and washed out on that first try. The thing that stuck with me was mindfulness. I knew it was missing from my life. It took another two years but I decided to give Headspace a try. The thing was, I had to give myself permission to NOT participate in the mediation before I could accept even starting the process.

It turned out that Andy Puddicombe's voice was pleasant and friendly. I wasn't asked to do more than breathe for a bit at first. And the Basics 1 series had an option to keep the sessions as short as three minutes.

It worked. I'm still meditating 10 minutes a day, nearly every day, and it's made a difference for me. I'm calmer, more thoughtful, with more regulation and less distress. The meditation practice has allowed me to grow into adding a small daily journaling practice and an exercise practice. I don't think I'd be here without it. I've also restarted DBT (on hold because of COVID, but the teletherapy sessions continue even if the group sessions don't right now).

Lastly, when I'm seeking a deeper experience, maybe call it a location-based mindset, I play the 'Japanese Oase' sound generator from MyNoise.net. There's something about the water, the garden sounds, and the suikinkutsu (a Japanese outdoor garden installation and music instrument ""played"" by water droplets falling into a pool inside a pot or bell). It's a pretty magical sound.

Good luck, OP. It's okay if you're only safe inside/with yourself, and it's okay if you never find a ""safe place"". Sometimes we can't subscribe to or conjure the constructs which come easily to other people. You still deserve peace."

To travel between galaxies is another matter altogether.

BTW the plane that hit the Empire State Building still killed three people in the plane and eleven people in the building. It also damaged the cables of an elevator car and sent it falling 75 stories into the basement. The occupants survived because the brakes slowed their descent.

The plane itself damaged three floors, at least, and started a fire when an engine sheared off and landed on the roof of a nearby building.

Back to 9/11, the hijackers may not have intended to bring down the Twin Towers but the sure as fuck intended a shocking spectacle of damage and death that day. Has the intelligence information chain not failed, the attacks potentially could have been prevented, regardless of the scope of damage.

You points re: intelligence agencies failing to stop terrorist attacks don't negate my point re: their intended purposes. Just because failure happens doesn't mean it's not still their function to stop as many potential attacks as possible.

My own mother earned an Educational Doctorate, but tried to get everyone else to raise her kids. She even went so far as to move her own mother across the country hoping grandma would basically be our nanny. It lasted less than a year. When I was was a toddler and my brother was an infant she entered a program for working professionals to earn a Master's Degree in Pupil Personnel Services (I think). She was never home, my dad did everything for all of us. We got into school and even then she was constantly forgetting to pick us up by the time the after-school program closed. It just gets worse from there.

She only ever cared about herself, her image, how she appeared to others. She earned that Educational Doctorate I mentioned and then retired. She never did anything with it. She still insists everyone call her ""Doctor"". She only ever did it for the title and the prestige she assumed it would bring to her. She took up a spot the EdD program for working professionals to get that degree when someone else could have been in that spot who actually gave a shit about the education system, helping pupils, solving systemic problems, or even who had an ounce of compassion for anyone or anything.

Having expertise in parenting or education does not equal being a good parent.

internetparents,ffn9irl,t3_eu1lqi,1580063432.0,"I saw you mention CPTSD and I was compelled to share this: Developmental Trauma Disorder is the childhood version of CPTSD. The diagnosis would be meant to differentiate between those who suffered long-term child abuse and those who suffered long-term abuse & confinement as adults - like POWs. Respected professionals like Bessel van Der Kolk pushed to have DTD added to the DSM-5 but the APA wasn't having it for liability concerns - patients suing providers for changing diagnoses. This is coming from my therapist, who has created programs for entire hospital systems and is herself respected in her field. 

Learning about DTD opened a new way of understanding myself. It has led to better self-care and better engagement in my treatment modalities. Knowing that an entire segment of mental health professionals take DTD so seriously helps bolster my resolve to get better. I know I'm not ""making it all up"". 

All that said, I started journaling last year. I saw you say that it makes you feel terrible and I hope this can help you change that feeling. I wasn't sure at first how journaling would help or what I would get out of it. Because of the abuse I suffered my memory is faulty, which is hard for me because I had a mind like a steel trap when I was younger. Writing down my activities every day helps me reflect on how I'm spending my time. I was convinced I was a lazy piece of shit who wasn't good for anything and never did anything that mattered. My journaling showed me proof that voice in my head was wrong. It was lying to me and holding me back from healing.

I do a very bullet-point style journal right now. There are few long sentences or paragraphs, it's mostly times & activities with occasional notes with relevant details. Now I know what time I wake up, get out of bed, what my dreams were the night before, how often I shower & brush my teeth, how often I walk my dogs and spend time playing with them, when I'm on social media & reddit - including when I share or contribute something, when I cook, what I eat, when I run errands, how often I contribute to the household by doing dishes and/or laundry, when I engage in my hobbies, how often I talk to friends, and - lately - how often I go to the gym and what I accomplish when I'm there. It's been eye-opening, to say the least, and I have concrete data on the areas in life where I'm succeeding and which need work. Journaling gives me some structure to tackle those areas needing improvement and shows me proof when I've succeeded. No one can tear down that which I've built for myself because it's inside me now. I could burn the paper it's all written on and it wouldn't change the fact that I've changed my self-talk for the better. I'd pick up a new journal and keep writing. 

I have proof now that my inner critic is abusive, and only exists because my abusers ensured I internalized as much of their abuse as possible to make their lives easier and more convenient - by making me believe I was the problem all along. But now I know the truth, and it's changing how I talk to myself for the better. I deserve validation, encouragement, boundaries, and to seek accomplishment for my own satisfaction. And now my self-talk reflects those things, even if it changes slowly over time. 

My therapist encourages writing because (as she puts it) the action moves the mental processes from lower brain functions - down in the fight/flight areas - to the higher brain functions, which helps a traumatized person engage in their thoughts & feelings while performing the mind-body task of writing, which itself is often its own mindfulness exercise.

offbeat,ff4inb7,t3_erc4sq,1579564523.0,"Amtrak's history of accommodating this group in the past by charging a few hundred dollars to make the necessary arrangements shows that there is new discrimination in the policy. There are 16 total people traveling together, and it's reasonable to accommodate all of them on one train ride, including the 5 in the travel group who use wheelchairs. 

Quite frankly, it sounds like most commenters didn't read the article and/or don't give a shit about actual accommodation. I have family born with congenital disabilities who are wheelchair-bound. They deserve respect and accommodation."

> It's just baffling that the sweet dog who curls up in bed with us every night will also go batshit and suddenly have selective hearing anytime we bring her somewhere new.  

Dogs do not generalize their learning. It's not their makeup. Everything taught must be proofed and then re-taught and re-proofed in new environments and circumstances. 

Hope that helps explain some if the difficulty you're having. Good luck."

Bernie wasn't the only one urging Warren to run for prez in 2016. She didn't stab anybody in the back. She was a new senator making her choices and I, for one, will not demonize her for it. Should anything happen to Bernie, I'm voting for Warren without question. I refuse to be party to sowing vitriol between the supporters of the only two decent candidates still running."

I'm so glad your family, boyfriend, and cats have been supporting you and spending time with you. Connection matters. I hope you'll see a counselor, for all the reasons you listed. It's hard to be brave when you've been through something so scary. I know because I was held up at gun point as part of an armed robbery some years back. I didn't get help, and the incident, paired with my depression and anxiety, drove me to agoraphobia. I'm finally working on my issues and I can tell you for certain that I wish I'd done it sooner. I feel like I lost a decade of my life, my friends, and some of my sanity. 

You can get through this, and get better. I promise."

It is meant to delineate between childhood trauma suffered over time (DTD) and adult trauma suffered over time (CPTSD). I offer this because it was brought to my attention recently by my therapist. Prominent mental health professionals advocated for DTD to be included in the DSM-5 but failed for liability reasons. The APA didn't want to open its membership to malpractice lawsuits from prior misdiagnosis - as it was explained to me, anyway.

Please consider counseling and/or therapy. Cost is always a consideration, so any help is good - even support groups can be a lifeline. Good luck."
