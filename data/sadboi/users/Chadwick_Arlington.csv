There is a good chance it will continue to be a roadblock.    You could find a compelling argument that any approach is unrealistic. 

Really, the reason why I came back to Bernie is because he’s trying to start a movement. He’s trying to get people involved and pay attention to politics.   So many more people are paying attention to the corruption in our system.

I can still function pretty well in day to day life, but it makes socializing very difficult.  It also sometimes feels like my brain is operating at about 5%; like a computer that tries to boot up but the operating system requires more resources then the computer can handle, so it just gets stuck on the loading screen. Which also often makes me feel tired, like I never fully wake up. 

 Very Occasionally I have good days where my head seems clear and i almost feel talkative - I’m generally a very quiet person and people often assume I’m shy, but my brain just can’t figure out what to say.

If that’s the case then maybe you can find other methods to communicate when things gets difficult.  Sometimes when I feel I can’t talk about something that’s bothering me I will write a letter/ email. That allows me to put my thoughts into words without being put on the spot. And I can usually choose my words carefully enough that it doesn’t trigger her to become defensive. That can then lead into an easier, more productive conversation.

Not nearly as often or as studiously as I should, but just a few minutes of focused breathing and trying to identify negative thought patterns and imagine throwing them away does significantly reduce my anxiety (also anger or frustration depending on the situation).   I feel weird suggesting meditation as it’s always something I’ve kind of blown off saying “it’s not really my type of thing”; which it totally isn’t. But it does help and I should make it a daily practice instead of just when I’m already in a pretty bad state.

Anxiety,ey9kerk,t3_cw8ahf,1566945452.0,"Pretty much explains my existence.  I am pretty high functioning, enough so that I didn’t realize I had an anxiety disorder until 2-3 years ago.  Over that time period I don’t know if it’s gotten worse, or it just seems worse because I’m aware of it.   I’ve been trying to identify the underlying cause of each of the catalysts that cause my anxiety.  Do  all of the things you listed have the same root cause or are they different. Phone calls make me anxious because I think I’m an uninteresting person to talk to and I have trouble connecting my thoughts to my mouth.  If I have to make the call it’s the worst, but it usually centers around me knowing that the burden is on me to have a reason for calling, I have to speak first and explain why I’m bothering this person. That is one of my root causes, over-empathy. I worry way too much about bothering people or saying the wrong thing.  For that reason emails and texts are generally easier for me because I have time to consider my wording, but I still feel like I’m not saying it the right way, or not professional enough, or maybe that sounded rude. 

The other aspect is analysis paralysis.  If I have to call my bank because I can’t log into the online banking, I will try and rehearse or plan what I have to say to the person, but my brain gets stuck thinking about what I have to say that I can’t bring myself to push the button and make the call. (True story, haven’t had online banking for like 5 years).  I never thought of it as analysis paralysis because it isn’t what I would typically consider analyzing something. I actually discovered analysis paralysis was a big problem for me because I used to play a lot of hearthstone. A little over a year ago I thought it would be fun to try and enter tournaments and compete which involved me putting more money into the game so I could be competitive. But it got harder and harder for me to sit down and play, just like hitting the call button, I couldn’t hit the play button to queue into a game because I was constantly analyzing decks and which one would be the best to play.  It has actually helped me to realize that because I can say to myself “stop, it doesn’t matter, just hit the button”.   But it is still a challenge. If I lose a game I will go back into analysis mode. “Does this deck just suck? Do I just suck? Which deck should I play now?”  

I also wanted to bring it back to what you were saying about responsibility. I both crave and actively avoid responsibilities. And I always have. I never understood how people could be so busy and keep taking on new tasks, still maintain their friendships, and continue to pile on. If I get busy for a week I can’t wait to be done, and I will rarely pile on unless someone else is seeking me out. So both my work (freelancing) and my social life comes in spurts where I’ll see a lot of friends all at one time or work a ton in a short span of time, then there’s like a month of nothing on the other end.  Which is terrible because I don’t put myself in the driver seat of my own life. I am just hoping friends want to hang out or that work stays consistent enough that I don’t have to seek out new jobs.  

Sorry for the stupidly long comment, but it was just something that I (like I’m sure many in this sub)can relate to and struggle with on a daily basis.  I would suggest trying any coping mechanisms you can find to see if something works.  If you can manage the “don’t think, just do” approach, it can help and hopefully make it easier over time because you’ll hopefully realize that these little things don’t really matter.  But I also know that telling a person with anxiety to “just don’t overthink it” is kinda like telling someone with depression to “just cheer up”.  Meditation, therapy, to-do lists, there are approximately a million lists online of possible coping mechanisms for you to try.  But I hope it helps to know you’re not alone in this really obnoxious disorder.  If you ever need someone to chat with or vent to feel free to dm me."

politics,eqwb0kl,t1_eqt4p0e,1560355099.0,"I understand that she is not the judge and jury on impeachment, yes.  But she is the leader of the Democratic Party and she’s telling people he’s not worth impeaching and Actively trying to downplay the conversation of members of her party who want to begin an impeachment inquiry. Impeachment proceedings should not be take place for political reasons, such as clothe Clinton BS. But to not pursue impeachment hearing for political reasons is cowardly. It just reinforces the current precedent that rich and powerful people are simply above the law.  

It probably doesn’t have more than 30 votes or something right now. But this is literally congress’s job. It is their job to make laws and they take an oath, just like the president to uphold those laws. If the president is breaking those laws, congress is the only authority to enforce them. She says he broke the law, he should be in prison, but because we don’t have the votes I’m scared that I’ll lose. That I’ll make the case and people won’t follow me and then I’ll be out of a job. That’s not being a leader, that’s hiding in your office and hoping the people don’t ask you to do something hard."

But it really just looks like she’s scared of losing and wants the voters to bail her out of having to be the bad guy.  She’s the weak parent that says “go ask your father/mother” when their bratty kid is trying to get away with some BS.
politics,eqseuo2,t3_bzgly5,1560283286.0,"I understand the “we need to address many topics and issues” argument, I thought that as well when he first brought this up. What changed my mind was firstly, if you believe climate change is a real threat, an existential threat, than no other issue matters if you don’t address it. Second, you can address a whole host of issues while still centering the conversation around climate change (e.g. how would your plan for the economy address climate change, how are you going to create jobs addressing climate change, how can we work with our allies around the world to address climate change?  Lastly, for decades every republican debate has been about tax cuts, tax cuts for the wealthy, tax cuts again, banning abortion by cutting your taxes.  If our opinion is that this is an existential threat, we need to treat it that way, not as just one of the 360 issues that we’d ideally like to address sometime in the future. Maybe it doesn’t need to be an entire debate, maybe half a debate?"

politics,eqn4reb,t1_eqmx2yx,1560171648.0,"I can see the merits of such a debate. Climate scientists are saying that we have an incredibly small window of time to act to slow down or mitigate the impact that climate change will cause. If that’s the case, then climate change is the number 1 priority for humanity. It’s an existential question. If we don’t address this issue, no other issue matters.  And think about the branding of Republicans, for 30+ years their debates have been about tax cuts, and abortion, and tax cuts, and tax cuts. I think we can have a debate where we shape all the questions and answers with the core question of climate change as issue 1- how does your economic policy address climate change?  And this is from someone who believes the most important issue is getting corporate money out of politics.  It’s not like you’re going to learn a great deal about each of the 23 candidates from pre-prepared 60 second statements about their foreign policy."
politics,eqj290j,t1_eqimfm4,1560097626.0,It is upsetting to me that this isn’t a bigger issue being talked about and discussed.  I don’t want a nominee that only got 20% of the votes.  Or people just choosing Biden because he’s “electable” and not because anyone believes in him.

Our government is incredibly corrupt, they spend all of their time at big fund raisers with billionaires and millionaires trying to get money and then we wonder why the rich keep getting richer and are paying zero in taxes.  So, especially in a primary, perhaps whether they actually care about their constituents or just their corporate donors should cross some people off your list.

politics,epzh4q4,t1_epz59bb,1559665565.0,"My hope is that they are trying to maintain some momentum on impeachment while investigations into his finances are still under way. The more they have against him the easier it will be to sway public opinion in impeachment hearings. 

My fear is that it’s just cowardice and that she just wants to punt to the voters and hope they choose to remove him, which is not any less of a political risk.  Also, what about the political risk of letting this man go free without even a slap on the wrist. That will set a very bad precedent, but why even worry about the precedent when we have to worry about the actual president?  He and McConnell could actually tear apart any semblance of democracy that was in this country and create their own white Christian corporate empire. What larger political risk could you possibly worry about?"
politics,epzfxx3,t1_epzcl15,1559664889.0,"So I am pretty openly anti-Biden. And of course if he gets the nomination I will be supporting him any way I can. What progressives want is a progressive candidate. Moving the establishment left is a great thing, but I have zero faith in Biden’s resolve to actually be progressive. if Bernie got elected I have no doubt that he would do everything he could to make Medicare for all a reality. When Biden moves left I question if it’s just empty platitudes from a politician.  This sounds like more of a campaign move in response to the negative media he was getting about his previous climate plan than like something that he actually cares about.  I just hope people who vote for him in the primaries do it because they believe he is going to lead this country in the right direction and not because he’s “electable”.  I do applaud him for saying he won’t take money from fossil fuel companies. But he should add pharma, insurance, banking, and probably a dozen others to that list. Electing Biden and going back to politics as “normal” isn’t realistic. McConnell and trump and decades or terrible policies have put us in such a corrupt atmosphere that we have to actively undo that, and not just resume the same old policies that led us to Trump in the first place. 

Btw: not necessarily for Bernie either, although I do think he’d be a good president. I also like warren and very willing to be swayed by some of the others."

politics,epj9032,t1_epj5jvj,1559249950.0,I think this is such a good idea. This country needs a better way for representatives to hear the needs and struggles of their constituents. Paid lobbying only allows rich people to be better heard/represented than poor people.  Instead of all the time politicians spend fundraising from billionaires and millionaires they should be required to have some sort of real dialogue with their actual constituents.

politics,epdjpdh,t1_epdc3q2,1559167601.0,"Yes, I wasn’t trying to disguise my bias. I do not like Biden and I think he is probably the worst democratic candidate. There’s probably 12 I’ve never heard of, so maybe someone else is worse, but I’d be surprised. When I said “Biden problem” I was referring to my dislike of him and not implying that it was some unquestionable fact. You are entitled to prefer Biden if that is your choice. If he ends up being the nominee I will gleefully vote for him over trump.  

I do look forward to the progression of the primaries, and I hope Biden does what he’s done in the past, Gaffe until he doesn’t seem “electable” anymore.  

There are only two candidates that I believe have a resolute interest in fixing this country, and I’m wouldn’t be surprised if you thought they were some of your “fringe” candidates. But I reject the notion that Biden is more “electable” than any other candidate. I imagine a good chunk of people said Obama was unelectable, that trump was unelectable."

politics,epd4ve2,t1_epcwh8d,1559161999.0,"Interesting. I’m not sure how much any “analysis” is worth at this point, but I’d actually think RCV might help Biden because people who support him only like him because of name recognition and because they think of him as uncle jo from the Obama years. And they are not even familiar with how terrible his political history actually is from a progressive viewpoint. So his lead wouldn’t be affected because those people don’t even know/care who else is running.  I still think we need RCV because winner take all in a 23+ person race is pretty dumb. We could theoretically end up with a nominee that got like 7% of the votes.  But you’re right, it wouldn’t fix the Biden problem."
