KDRAMA,etvd8x5,t3_cdl0jg,1563232354.0,"Kinda get what you are trying to say. But I am not growing out of kdramas. Sometimes I just got bored because they showcase the same thing for ratings/number of viewers. That is why, whenever I feel got bored watching non-stop kdramas, that is when I channel my boredome to Korean variety (Running Man to be specific) or to American series esp if I want investigative or scifi series then if I got bored from that, I go to anime esp if I want slice of life type of genre or adventure genre. You know, I just keep on circling around them. I just switch from here to there because most of time they deliver the same thing. Just a twitch on the plot and characters. But you know, you can never judge a story alone because there are so many things to consider. Anyway, long story short, kdramas are not getting worse. Korean actors and actresses make me still in awe for their potrayal of the character. That is one thing for sure. And I like that kdramas are slowly incorporating bold topics like older woman and younger male relationship, equal treatment for men and women at work, single dad trying to be in a relationship with a woman. It is not just romance anymore and I think that is better."

runningman,esrp59p,t3_c909a6,1562232100.0,"I think Se Chan has no developed character yet in RM. Maybe it is also disadvantageous because Gary did add spice to RM. Sang Yeob, Da Hee or even Jin Young are my top nominees to replace him but of course it is undoubtedly to happen. The episode where those 3 are the guests actually outshined Se Chan. Like, they know what to say, when to speak without acting so hard. But I am still hoping that Se Chan will have his own character in RM. Maybe he is also pressured to be in RM because people are expecting too much from him. And compared to So Min, she already got her nice share of screen time. Also, even though some viewers hate So Min because she acts flirty in the show, I think, that is the character she wanted to develop. SJH is not flirty to male guests so it is perfect for So Min to be that way. So Min already snatched the title of being a female Kwang Soo. But Se chan cannot be flirty to female guests unlike Kwang Soo before he got a gf. Even if he tried to be flirty, it just doesn't work."

YG is really sh*t. They don't know how to handle their artists. Just sad because most of the idols I like are from YG. I mean, Hanbin is stupid for going after drugs but who knows what was happening to him during 2016 that the only way to rely into something is thru illegal drugs."

KDRAMA,eqa995t,t3_bvkozq,1559928128.0,"So this is what I realized after watching episode 2.  Mother Cheosol despised Eunseom because of the three laws according to Great White Wolf.
1. Not to cross the Great Black Wall. 
2. Not to grow seed.
3. Not to tame animals.

But my thought is Eunseom did not exactly bring bad luck to Wahan tribe because of this. I think that those who slaughtered them did.

Both Eunseom and the warriors (Mobaek and friends) both did cross the Great Black Wall. 

Also, the warriors went to Iark because they want to conquer it to use the people as their slaves and the land as their farm. (Which is also applicable to the second rule.) 

Lastly, both used horses as their means of transporation. 

I think, Eunseom is not exactly Aramun but used as a mean of Aramun. For what purposes, that is what we are going to find out for the next episodes. I know this is not much of a revelation but it just so interesting to point out some little details.

I am really invested in this drama. I hope that it will not falter nor fail in the end. But so far, this is a good drama.
