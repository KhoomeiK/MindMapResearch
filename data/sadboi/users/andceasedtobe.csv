Their newer ones are still there, but I believe the ones they made before the discovery of the abuse were deleted. Someone else mentioned SomeOrdinaryGamers / Mutahar earlier, he also made a video on it. Worldcorp's site has been taken down due to the contents of their videos, but, if you're *really* curious and want to see it yourself, there's bound to be some videos of theirs on youtube that've been reuploaded and haven't been taken down. I wouldn't recommend watching them, though. They also made music, for whatever reason, and they do have a [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/worldcorp-enterprises), if you also wanted to take a look at that. I don't believe the music contains anything along the lines of the videos, it's mostly just rap, though I haven't listened to all of them, so I'd be careful with those, too."

I was/am really interested in ARGs/Alternate Reality Games [And weird, creepy shit on the internet in general], so it was something I was curious about. At this point though, with the Dreamer Heaven video, the removal of the Worldcorp website, and the fact that I doubt any ARG would use actual snippets of something as disgusting as actual CP, I'm actually pretty concerned and just want to know what it actually is."

AskReddit,fg8n53b,t1_fg8lumy,1580625097.0,"LEO? I don't know what you mean. I've just known about Worldcorp for, like, 2 years, since I was around 14, so I've just been keeping up on what's going on with it. From my understanding, though, this is just entry level Worldcorp shit. They had a site a while back, but it got taken down. I'm sure there's archives of the other videos that were on there, and I know there's links to the songs they had, too. I don't know what a LEO is, though. Sorry."
AskReddit,fg8ddk9,t1_fg7x9iz,1580616216.0,"Worldcorp Enterprises. I remember that. The video that was taken down due to it being actual CP was (Dreamer Heaven Level's) 1. Rain's Demise of Reptile, IIRC, but the Fatherhood video and another I can't remember also got taken down due to its association with Worldcorp and that Dreamer Heaven video. Fucked up shit.

Edit: I also remember seeing a video that Worldcorp sent to someone who asked if their videos \[That being Fatherhood video and the other ones they had\] were real. It was of a young boy covered in dirt and dirty water and other substances that I don't even know \[But it was likely bodily fluids or waste or something like that\], and the audio was incredibly distorted. It's all fucked up, and it scared the shit out of me when I saw it."

You said you don't want to hurt anyone, so unless you want to and/or have made plans to hurt yourself, they wouldn't hospitalize you. I definitely do understand the fear of getting hospitalized, especially when I'm struggling, but please talk to a doctor or medical professional about this so you can stop yourself from reaching the point where you would need to go inpatient. And, I'm not a professional, but I do understand, I've been there, and I'm willing to listen if you need to vent. But, again, please talk to a medical professional/doctor/therapist."

unpopularopinion,ffw9edv,t1_ffw8okl,1580290815.0,"I've heard of James Bulger. What happened to him was absolutely horrific. I have said that there are cases where there does need to be prison and punishment, and I do believe murder is one of them, especially when the victim is so young and it includes sexual assault. I was primarily referring to crimes and charges not as high-level and brutal as murder or sexual assault, but even in cases of juveniles committing vile crimes such as those where they do deserve prison time, I do believe there should be some kind of treatment so the inmates around them are at less of a risk of being victimized by that person specifically, if that makes any sense."

And, I agree with the prison portion, I did say that punishment is necessary in certain cases, especially concerning sexual abuse or rape, even when it comes to people under the age of 18. But, again, they should have some kind of treatment for whatever issues they do have, at least so the inmates around them are at less of a risk of being traumatized, sexually assaulted or raped, and/or killed by said individual."
