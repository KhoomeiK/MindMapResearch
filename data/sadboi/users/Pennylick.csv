Kefir,fqxdgza,t1_fqwwhrb,1589730470.0,It's totally easy I SWEAR.

It seriously is the very most simple and satisfying thing that I have made/done on a regular basis.
Kefir,fqxdab7,t3_gleeaq,1589730363.0,It sounds like you're closing/sealing your jar up in the first ferment?? I wouldn't advise doing that and I'd bet that's what caused this. I use a papertowel or dish towel and rubberband that around the top of the jar. I only close the jar after I've removed the grains.
