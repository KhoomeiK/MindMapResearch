Regarding Walmart vs church comparison - Walmart, you‚Äôre walking & moving. Can leave an aisle if too crowded. Can leave after 2 min if it‚Äôs too crowded. You have many choices.

In a house of worship, you pick a seat, and sit there through the service (or leave). You can even choose the last row bc people can still come fill that row. Then what? You could certainly be elbow to elbow with strangers - and you have. 

Now picture if those strangers near you are asymptotic carriers that can infect you (50-80% can be). Or if someone coughs - row over and and their spittle reaches and infects you. Or you don‚Äôt become symptomatic but you infect people& surfaces outside of church you come into contact with. What if you give to your grandma and she passes from covid You contracted at church?

I want you to know I‚Äôm all for freedom of religion. But I also believe in science and the devastation and death this virus has caused. And what we need to do in order to be safe.

In my state, we get 2.5 ounces every 14 days, 5oz/month - but that‚Äôs a max. So just can‚Äôt buy more in that 2 week period. But if you had staggered purchasing throughout that 2week period, you start to get Access to your limit on a rolling basis (like buy 2.5 Oz, get locked out, but in 4 days you could have like a 7g added back to your allotment and make another purchase).And you can petition the state for double (10 oz/mo) and those i know who have petitioned for increase apparently get approved easily."
medicalmarijuana,fq3q0mz,t1_fpu441x,1589068907.0,"Otto x BD 2:1 sounds lovely, both great strains. Haven‚Äôt seen GTI offer that in my state. But I could make it next time I find BD RSO (stocked on Otto)"
medicalmarijuana,fq3l9q9,t3_gficc5,1589067587.0,"I used Otto when I first got my med card 3 years ago, then poof. Otto disappeared. Recently came across Otto RSO on sale and bought 6 vials. I made homemade edibles and at first, nothing. But then I upped the dosing a s found good relief with larger dose, twice a day. (For anxiety & chronic pain)"

medicalmarijuana,fq3jhzq,t1_fq3i32b,1589067107.0,This has also helped my insomniac mom who‚Äôs retired. She was so excited the first night she tried vaping for sleep and got a full 7 hours uninterrupted - she is sleeping so well with medical cannabis now.
medicalmarijuana,fq3iqg1,t1_fq3i32b,1589066881.0,"Dispensary carts with battery on low/cool setting ideally. But my night pens are just one temp, purposefully just a quick drag battery, so I‚Äôm not messing with buttons that may wake me more if I‚Äôm stirring."
medicalmarijuana,fq3i3hs,t3_gg9qzg,1589066685.0,"Bio Jesus and Mag Landrace + 1:1 & 2:1 Harlequin strains help me most with similar maladies (autoimmune arthritis/chronic pain, anxiety/ptsd, insomnia. I also use a super high cbd medical strain (like 10:1) daily for overall health. and i reach for limonene & myrcene strains a lot for euphoric, uplifting moods (ie sour diesel, kosher tangle, clementine, etc). I can do some sativa dominant strains if the terp profile is right on for my body, whereas when i was first starting out, i just flat out avoided sativas.

I use a combination of vaping & RSO mostly, for RSO I make homemade edibles (chocolates, gummies) or capsules in dispensary provided gel caps (also avail on amazon). I think it‚Äôs super important to research tons, learn about terpenes and see what works best for your body. Everyone is so different in what helps their own bodies medically."
medicalmarijuana,fq3fm08,t1_fq2jl32,1589065962.0,"And FWIW, I find RSO to be by far the most economical of all medical cannabis. But i think finding strains for sleep then trying them to see what works best for your body is really important to achieve results."
medicalmarijuana,fq3f1yt,t3_ggjvpu,1589065797.0,"Lifelong insomniac here, like serious chronic struggle to sleep.

For me, it‚Äôs specific strains and delivery that have helped me combat insomnia.

I use RSO & vapes with sleep promoting terpene profiles. I vape to get me ready for bed. Then I take homemade RSO chocolates (or i make RSO capsules) with these same sleep strains, this helps keep me stay asleep. If i wake middle of night, I vape again. This method has really helped me transition from relying on nightly RX to sleeping through the night regularly with medical cannabis. 

I really sleep well with Gobstopper and/or Mag Landrace using the vape + RSO. once I got into a good sleep pattern consistently, sleep came more naturally, but I keep up the evening Cannabis routine. Life changer!"
