StopSelfHarm,fmv04xo,t3_fxk2ir,1586402846.0,"I think a lot of the reason my therapist didn't care is because self harm was a symptom, not  the cause. As others have said, provided it wasn't life-threatening or disabling self harm was merely an indication of a larger underlying problem. Now that I'm a bit removed from the situation, I appreciate that my therapist didn't focus on my only means of communication (self harm) when she already understood and was addressing the deeper issues. 

Please don't assume that this therapeutic approach is dismissive. Cutting may be the only language we understand at  times, but trained professionals know to treat it with the priority it deserves (which is less than whatever is causing the self harm in the first place). Stopping the behavior is a long road that often has nothing explicitly linked with the behavior."

Gradually I'd come to realize the urge with enough time to stop myself. Then I was able to see it coming a little further out: this is a stressful activity, this is something I usually mess up. Once I got to the stage where I could realize ""this is the emotional state you're in when you hit yourself"" things really started to improve.

She needs help beyond what you can give her, but you and your roommates are providing a wonderful source of support in the meantime.

I think you're correct not to take away her razors. As you note, it is a form of coping and to take it away when she's in her current emotional state can be incredibly destabilizing. It sounds messed up to say this but when she's cutting she's not killing herself and she's ""safe."" I think they used to call (perhaps still do?) self-harm para-suicidal behavior; it approximates suicide but in a way that satisfies the urge in a ""safe"" way. Others certainly speak up if I'm incorrect in these assumptions, and I am certainly not saying that cutting is a good thing or a healthy coping mechanism. 

Which leads me to my final point: while remaining available to talk (both when she's feeling the urge to cut and immediately after she cuts, if she reaches out) I think it would be important to emphasize this is a temporary option until she develops better self-care skills. Cutting is a stop-gap, and is not a long-term solution. Her choice of self-soothing is not a sustainable option for her or for your household. You cannot become a hostage of her behavior."
