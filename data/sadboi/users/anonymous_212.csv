Recovery from alcoholism is a profound positive change and companions and partners find themselves faced with a less compliant and more assertive version of their friend. Unless family and friends support sobriety, the sober alcoholic must protect their sobriety from them by creating a safe distance. In AA the standard advice is to protect yourself from the people places and things that tempt you to drink."

The next group of steps, 8 through 10, focuses on who we harmed and admitting to them, if possible, what we did so that we can be on the best possible terms with everyone we know, this group of steps is summarized as MAKE UP.

Townes hospital, the first hospital in the US solely devoted to treating alcoholism and drug addiction. He was treated there 4 times before he had his spiritual awakening. Bill’s spiritual awakening might not have happened had it not been for the work of Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist.  Jung came to America with Sigmund Freud to attend a conference at Clarke University. There they heard William James, the author of “The Varieties of Religious Experience” give a talk. Freud scoffed at James and Jung began examining religious thought for its psychology. After their return to Europe, Freud and Jung parted ways perhaps due to this difference.  Jung received a patient from a wealthy American family, Roland Hazard, and treated him for a year in his sanitarium in Switzerland. Roland was an alcoholic.  Within a month of his return to the US, he was drinking again and his family sent him back to Jung. Jung told him that he couldn’t help him but that he was aware of alcoholics who were able to recover by finding God.  Roland returned to the US and began seeking God. Who he found was Frank Buchman, an evangelist who was trying to recreate early Christianity though a program called “First Century Christian Fellowship”. It’s mission was to meet informally in members homes and provide each other with support in the search for a spiritual life. Roland brought a friend of his to these meetings, Ebbie Thatcher, and Ebbie was a friend of Bill W. After Ebbie found God, he paid a visit to Bill and Bill was skeptical about God helping drunks. Then in his last hospitalization at the Townes hospital, Bill had a “White Light” spiritual experience and began attending the meetings with Ebbie and Roland.  William James says that most spiritual experience is of the educational variety but some of us have known other kinds. If you are willing to do whatever it takes, get medical help just as Bill did. AA has a long history of cooperation with the medical community. If you think your problem is serious, get into action. Take it serious and do whatever you have to to arrest the progression of the disease. I’m of the opinion that the disease can be arrested but needs maintenance in order to stay arrested.

One of the best was a two day workshop on Trauma Informed treatment and I felt it was well worth the time and money. I maintain my Credentials as a substance abuse counselor too because the state offers free on line CEUs that also satisfy social worker CEU requirements.

I’ve found that Dr. John Gottman and Ester Perel are great resources and if there are children, the work of Faber and Mazlish is tremendously helpful."
psychotherapy,fjp1pg1,t3_feepi3,1583539701.0,"Years ago I read about a longitudinal study of longevity that followed a group of middle aged men for 20 years. They measured their condition in several domains, physical, social and psychological. They discovered that the one item that predicted longevity more than anything else was push up capacity. Since then I’ve been working out more regularly.  I’m 64 and I can do 100 push-ups and 40 burpees. Lately I added 6 chin ups. I lift weights twice a week and run a mile in 10 minutes twice a week when weather permits. I found that getting fit has improved my sex life."

motorcycles,fjnvv50,t3_fedzdc,1583515372.0,"Back in 1975 I got my first motorcycle, a Honda CB165 and I loved it. Top speed was around 65 and I dropped it once going 50 but luckily I wasn’t hurt very bad because I was wearing all the protective gear. Gloves, leathers, boots and although the bike got scuffed up I was able to ride it home even though the handle bars were bent at a 90 degree angle. I replaced the bars bent the footpeg and shifter lever back into shape and resumed riding the next day. I now ride a 1999 Honda ST1100 and it’s sweet but your first motorcycle is like your first girlfriend, you’ll always have a sweet memory of her."
alcoholicsanonymous,fjm1vax,t1_fjlt639,1583459671.0,Surrender means to admit complete defeat. It means to admit to yourself that on your own you cannot halt the progression of this disease. In AA parlance it means you are willing to do whatever it takes to recover. It means to let go of your old idea that you can handle this on your own.

alcoholicsanonymous,fjl3uhj,t3_fdylzg,1583439407.0,"The best book on relating to children is “How to talk so kids listen and how to listen so kids talk” by Faber and Mazlish. It was inspired by the ideas of Haim Ginnot. Dr John Gottman, the world renowned marriage counselor dedicated his first book to Dr. Ginnot. The key is to try to understand the motivating emotions first and express that understanding in a way the child can understand. It works with adults too."

Herpes,fjhpvzq,t3_fdep4w,1583352864.0,"By limiting yourself to HSV positive people you are doing yourself a big disservice. Work on your anxiety, that’s the problem. I’ve had HSV2 since I was 27 and I’m 64 now. I was married to a woman who was HSV2 positive but we broke up in 2008 and since then I’ve only dated women who, by chance were HSV2 negative. That’s 5 different women who didn’t have a problem with me having herpes. I did feel a little anxious telling them and twice I was rejected but I’m an adult so I can handle rejection. But my attitude has been it’s not going to stop me from finding someone to love. I’m with a wonderful woman now and I’m hoping this one is the one but if she’s not, I’m not going to be defeated."

BernieSanders,fjeff9a,t3_fcysob,1583270907.0,"The constitution ensures that the wealthy yield more power by way of the electoral college and the superdelegate system. Members of the electoral college are there because of political donations and the same is true of superdelegates. The poor are locked out by gerrymandering and the loss of voting rights after felony conviction. Try to sell some pot, get convicted and lose the right to vote, permanently. Grow up neglected because your mom has to work two jobs and do a felony, lose the right to vote permanently. That’s over 19 million people and 19% of the black population.  We actually have a full racist system in the US."
