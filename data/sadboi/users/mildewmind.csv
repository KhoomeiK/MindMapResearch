selfharm,flkfbku,t1_flkf2s3,1585239850.0,"As for your question about ""bad boys"" I'm honestly not sure. I do appreciate critical thinking (and I'll always like a nice leather jacket). But I am also very passive and am so used to going with the flow (you know, just surviving the next ten seconds), so even if I'm with someone and they express a problematic idea or joke, I'll just go along and pretend it's fine. Or if im not comfortable doing something ( originally thinking along the lines of sexually but could apply to anything) I'll still do it just so not to upset the other person. It's not like I'm being coerced, bc I don't tell them I don't want to, I'm just uncomfortable and do my best to do what they want and get it over with. I do think bc of my past you're right and I need to watch bc I'm a prime candidate to end up in another abusive situation. 

Addressing your thoughts on the GPS situation; I am also freaked out by thinking I'm being monitored. When I did live with my parents they used the same gps app. And in fact I know they had secret cameras in the house and bugged maybe me/my phone etc, bc they would be able to repeat conversations or actions back to me almost perfectly without them being there.
I was attempting to show that I was wanting to cooperate with my aunt and uncle when I downloaded it bc I knew I'd make them feel better. I regret it now, but don't know how to go about that conversation. 

As for my friends, my aunt and uncle only know them from stories as well. I have them enough info/ stories so that'd they be able to relate to people by name . They don't seem satisfied and want to meet them. I think it has to do with them both being law enforcement and worrying.

And I do see what your saying about anything being used to self harm. This is TMI and NSFW but I think when I'm with a person sexually and they get rough(with permission) the choking/slapping/hitting give me the same rush as self harming. It's not even necessarily a turn on for me sexually, but that's probably the only time it's socially acceptable to ask someone to do that. But once or twice it did get scary bc suddenly I'm back home and my dad's hitting me or my mom is sitting on me and I can't breath. The ""flashbacks"" only last a second but it's scary and I just try not to freak out, sometimes unsuccessfully.

And about recovery sucking, when does it really start? If I'm still doing bad stuff or feeling this way, am I really recovering? What exactly am I recovering from? Idk and you probably don't either, just questions I keep asking myself. 

Thank you for your comments, they ARE helpful and I do feel less alone. You give me hope! Thank you♥️!"
selfharm,flkf2s3,t1_fkya9ec,1585239725.0,"I just wanted to start by saying sorry for taking so long to respond. I did see and read your comment but wanted to wait until I was thinking clearly and could write out a decent response. 
(I did take notes as I went along your comment so I would know what I wanted to say, sorry if it's jumbled or doesn't make sense. It was almost two handwritten pages so some of it might seem like it comes from nowhere.) I'm also on mobile so sorry for formatting. I think I will also have to comment in multiple portions.

You described it perfectly when you said I'm good one day and the next is bad again and I get in a bad state and just keep thinking that I was already past this. 

Maybe you're right and I'm trying to find a breaking point with my aunt and uncle. I definitely didn't do it intentionally and I would never want to hurt them or upset them, but anything is possible at this point. I also think you're right and I'm just doing stuff because I can now. And reading about all this would probably be helpful, but it is hard sometimes, not only bc I don't know all the terms used in articles but also it's hard seeing my life laid out like that. Like when I'm reading a passage or looking some of my ""symptoms"" it's hard to read something like ""commonly exhibited if abused"" or something like that. I don't know why but it hurts to think about that I do qualify as someone like that and I think I don't want to admit that to myself.

As for making plans for the future that's it exactly. I really just assumed I'd be dead. Like even as a small child when I was 5 & 6, even before things got ""really"" bad, I never could see myself as an adult in the future. The smallest inconvenience or mean comment etc and my whole day is ruined. I feel absolutely terrible and I do get those thoughts like you were saying, that I wouldn't have to deal with it if I were dead. Then I get mad at myself for feeling like that and I start thinking about how dumb I am bc my situation is better now, if I can't understand that obviously I should just kill myself, and the cycle continues. And the ""just survive"" things is actually how I haven't made any attempts for a bit. When I was back in that house, in the thick of things, it was literally just ""survive these 10 seconds"" and I'd tell myself that if at the end of the time if I still felt that way/ whatever was still happening, I could kill myself. But when the time ran out I'd just start the clock over instead. It became a bit of game just to see how long I could last. Now it's just survive this day. Just make it through this task and this week. Just make it through this phase of my life.



And me being polite/ accomadating, etc. I didn't realize that that was a characteristic of abuse but I guess that makes sense. It just makes me awkward. Like for example, at work rn My coworkers will tease me ( not maliciously or anything, just kidding) and ask my why I'm so polite or nice and where I got my manners, or why I use certain phrases etc. Idk what to say. It's not like they're complimenting me or anything so I can't just say ""thanks"" and move on. I also can't explain all this stuff, so I basically just say ""oh idk haha"".

I know I probably shouldn't blame myself for some of the instilled stuff with my parents but it's just hard sometimes bc I feel like it's partially my fault for getting caught up by it and being affected by it. Alot of the ""bad stuff"" I agree isn't necessarily bad just stuff that's been indoctrinated in me as bad by religion and parents. And I do see why sugar babying is sex work and I did look it up and sex work is illegal in Ohio (where I'm at) so thanks for the tip to research.

I am actually gonna start the search for a therapist/psychiatrist today. 

I can't tell about my sexuality either. I'm also attracted to non binary/other identifying people ( gender doesn't matter to me), so maybe pansexual? I'm also trying to understand the difference between being physically attracted to someone and being emotionally attracted. Just for example, to keep it simple, I'll use ""traditional"" gender roles. What if I'm just more into the idea of dating a women and being with her sexually sometimes, while also understanding that I find guys generally attractive and occasionally do have the desire for straight sex but don't necessarily want to date a man at this point in time? I do appreciate your point that it isn't necessarily 50-50 and is fluid AND valid. I'm just so confused. I feel like I have to figure it out before I start looking for a relationship, that way I know what tell potential partners. 

As for the FWB triad thing, they're not that much older than me. They're a couple and he the oldest in their relationship, and is 6 years older than me. I wouldn't say that they're patronizing or anything just that we have very different interests and tastes in music/tv etc bc they know about all kinds of stuff that ""skipped my generation"". We have very different opinions and ideas even politically or about societal shifts,etc. and comments have been made about my age and naivety. Occasionally when we're talking about something, they'll bring up someone or something idk about and they'll say stuff like ""I can't believe you don't know blank"" or "" oh yeah I forgot you're young"". Like I said I don't think they're doing it to be patronizing, and they usually explain the thing right away but sometimes it gets to me. ( I should probably also mention that my mom had to approve all my music up until I was like 15 (at which point she got upset I listened to alternative music and my dad actually told her off in my defense) and she absolutely despised any kind of ""rap"" anything similar. If a pop song had like a 10 sec rap in the middle, she'd change the station. So I have almost no knowledge of rap or any ""black dominated music genre"" really. This only comes up bc that's alot of what they listen to or pop culture references they make. So when I don't know someone they're talking about it, they don't say anything I just get this vibe that they think I'm dumb.) We're good friends it's just hard sometimes bc I have to watch my behavior/ feelings around them. I can't have a romantic interest (which is fine I understand my role in the fwb, Unicorn thing) but I also have to watch that I don't show too much affection or attention to one or the other because the other one will get jealous. Even during sex it's a little exhausting bc sometimes we'll do it separately so I'm basically performing for both of them. (Most of the time well all participate, but like if I'm on my period. One NSFW example: I'm on period so no action on my end but I can perform so I go down on her and it's not a race or anything but sometimes it takes while for her to finish, so after about 25 mins she finishes. By now my jaw and tongue were about to fall off, but I didnt get much recovery time because it's his turn. I don't want him to be jealous so I go down on him while the two of them do more stuff up top.) Or one time I accidentally said ,""omg thank you so much I love you!"" ( For context I almost left something important behind and he reminded me last minute and I was excited bc I almost completely forgot. Also I say this all the time to friends or even like newish people I meet or co-workers etc. Not seriously or with much meaning), and they went out of his way to say "" no you don't love me, were not even going there"". I was just awkward because of course I didn't mean it like that but now I'm feeling and and it's all awkward. And in general bc they have their relationship and are happy and we have a physical relationship and are friends I'm not sure they realise that I might want to start looking for a romantic relationship for myself so I can feel that happiness too."
selfharm,fkxhsy3,t1_fkxcqps,1584628454.0,"Yes! Exactly! It's really weird to describe. Like I'd think about it all day non stop, it was like a craving or something. Sometimes I'd even get get shaky and as soon as I did it, all better."
selfharm,fkwvwy6,t3_fl1wim,1584608187.0,"Yes! I completely understand, I have the same problem. It's not just a release for me anymore its not just a sense of control , it's basically an addiction. I've been struggling for 4 years (as I'm writing this I just really, realised how long this had been going on), and I don't even know how to deal with being happy. I just need the numbness, the strange feeling of... Accomplishment...? That comes after. As stupid as it feels to say all that.

I've been trying to stop, mostly because of familial concerns it's caused and I don't want anyone to worry or just randomly try to check me (not that the family I'm with now has tried to, I'm just afraid that right afterwards it'll happen). So I have attempted to adopt what I thought were healthier coping mechanisms but apparently they're still self destructive and harmful ( this is base off of some families view points, not necessarily mine). And I can see that, I get why it could still be concerning bit it gets so confusing. It's just so strange to feel an overwhelming flood of emotions happy, sad and in between and actually have to feel them without being able to directly harm to control it. And then my secondary but still bad coping mechanisms are still frowned upon. It feels like I'm being pulled in so many directions."
nursinghomeproblems,fkwveax,t3_fkveft,1584607522.0,"I have no idea, so unfortunately maybe my comment isn't the most helpful for you, but I also work at a nursing home and we're sort of on lockdown. I'm in Ohio and the only people allowed in and out rn are staff and necessary medical personal (X-ray tech, EMTs, etc.). No family no visitors. Everytime someone enters the building including staff, for a shift, you have to fill out a questionere asking about symptoms, etc. and have your temperature taken. But we are allowed to leave the building and go about our normal business, so it's obviously not the same situation. I'm so sorry that you guys are dealing with that, and that is such a terrible decision to have to make. We had all kinds of new regulations and rules put in place ( they're constantly changing) and I thought my work situation was a tad rough ( there's other examples) but that just goes above and beyond crazy. 

It's so wrong for her workplace not to realize that she has other more important responsibilities (her children) and to try and coerce such response that way. 

I might suggest X posting in the r/legaladvice ( I think that's the appropriate sub) you might even be able to find specific to your state or area. I might also look into calling a law firm or similar agency if they're still open to ask about it. Usually they can discuss your situation via phone and give you some basic information and advice without charging you. You could also try reaching to speak to someone with the Department of Health & Senior Services for your state. They should be able to advise you and if her employer is in the wrong (and I sure hope they are), could try to open an investigation or case against them to protect your mother-in-law and her co-workers jobs. 

That is truly a terrible position to find yourself in, your family and responsibilities or your job and lively hood. I hope you guys are able to get through this and everything straightens itself out. Wishing you luck and sending love during this rough time♥️.

Cutters,fkwu1uc,t3_fkxo36,1584605815.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this and I understand exactly what your saying. Initially I started because it was an outlet to relieve my anger and pain. Then I realised I had control over something in my life for once. At one point one of my friends reported me to the school councilor and I wish I can say she tried to help me but she actually said I was doing it for attention. I had already been harming for over 6 months before the previously mentioned friend saw bc I accidentally rolled my sleeve up to high with out noticing. I tried to explain it to her and she didn't get it. I tried to explain it to the councilor and she didn't either, she continued to accuse me of lying and  trying to gain attention. After that it became an addiction, as stupid as that sounds. I didn't only do when I was stressed it became a routine. Even if I was having a good day, I'd do it because I didn't even know how to process the good emotions. If i didn't do it I'd start to feel like I was drowning. I can't honestly say I've stopped, bc even though I've taken some breaks I'm not totally clean. I still have mis steaps and times where my method changes and convince myself one method of harm is healthier than another. 

Life is hard and we're all just trying to figure this shit out. I know it feels good at the time and it helps you process. It lets feel in control. But if you continue, you'll lose that control to the ""addiction"". It's no longer just a choice you're making its something you have to do. I know you can't ""just stop"" but you can try to flee from this before it makes too much of an impact on your life.

The good thing, as if there could be a good side to any of this, is that you realise you might need help and you can see that this could cause you to go deeper into that spiral ( I looked at your other posts on your profile). I know nothing anyone says can make this better or fix anything ( at least it didn't for me) but I'm here for you if you ever need to talk. I'm sure other people in these communities are also willing to listen! 

You might feel like your drowning but the best way out isn't to swim deeper. I hope you can find a sense of peace or control in a different healthier way. Wishing you much luck and sending love your way♥️, there's ALWAYS hope!!! Sorry for the long comment. Long story short, we care about YOU. Messages are open if you need!"

death,ffzmc6p,t3_ew3iic,1580385791.0,"Unfortunately there will never be real answers from her about what her last moments were like, we can just hope it was quick. I see both sides of the situation here and it is a really rough choice. But I think I would do it. That way you won't live your life thinking about what you could have done. Go and give yourself the chance to say goodbye, to hold her hand or brush back her hair, one last time. That being said, I also know it would be difficult to deal with the after math and all of the questions but I think if you don't do it you'll regret it. I hope that some of your wounds will heal with time, but it might be hard to heal if you're beating yourself up about not seeing her again. Ultimately it is YOUR decision and you have to do what you think will be best for you and your healing as well. I'm so sorry you had to go through this, I'm sorry for your loss, and I wish you the best ♥️.

Edit: I did just want to add that I think your memories of her life and her actions will be what you remember and hold on to in the long run. When my grandfather passed I was very hesitant to be there in the moment, but now a few years later, I'm very glad I was able to spend those few moments with him after. Obviously your mom's passing was much more sudden and tragic and has to be considered in it's own light. I'm sorry you have to make this kind of decision."
