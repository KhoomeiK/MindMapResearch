It’s also reasonable that teenagers love saying edgy offensive things, especially in online chats and video games. 

1) I wouldn’t think your son is some racist or homophobe because of what he said. The majority of high schoolers will use the word “faggot” or “pussy” in casual chat. It’s normal and they don’t use these words in the literal sense. “Faggot” is usually the same as being a “pussy”, not specifically attacking homosexuals. The N word is just taboo in general so of course kids are going to say it. It’s edgy. I wouldn’t worry your son is some political racist just someone who loves triggering people online maybe.

2) your son is still an asshole for the lack of remorse. It’s a big deal when it happens no matter what the intent was. Hell if I was copy pasting a direct quote with the N word from a movie with a racist script, it’s STILL not okay and still offensive even if the intention is not malicious."
