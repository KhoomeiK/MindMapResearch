OnePiece,fkn6zz1,t3_fjgqml,1584356230.0," So, many people are still confused about this so I decided to give my opinion. Hope you agree with me. Let's say when Luffy arrives on Dressrosa both him and Doflamingo are at their 100% . After their struggles when they finally face each other Doffy is 95% while Luffy is 70%. Doffy gets Red Hawked and Luffy also gets beat up by Doffy and then by Bellamy. Doffy 85% and Luffy 60%. Then we see Doffy get hit by 2 of Law's Ultimate moves. He goes down to 75% by 1 move and then to 65% by the 2nd. Also remember that Law's Gamma Knife is a one hit KO attack. Doffy only stitched himself. That didn't mean he had healed himself. The organs were ruptured so now they would not be working 100%. Now its Doffy 65% vs Luffy 60%. But wait. The birdcage must be using some of Doflamingo's strength too right? So ultimately its Doflamingo 60% vs Luffy 60%.Its not that uneven now. The percentages do not represent HP. They represent their whole stamina. Luffy got reduced to 70% intially because of his struggles in the collisuem and especially due to his use of Conqueror's Haki. I didn't count the CoC clash between Doflamingo and Luffy because that would just equal out amongst them. Nevertheless the percentages were just to show that both Doflamingo and Luffy were almost even. Some people say that Luffy was not at his 100% so that's why I included this. This was required because its a 1 on 1 between Luffy and Doflamingo. The percentages are not to be taken too seriously. Now then lets begin the real battle. Luffy goes into Gear 4 and shits on Doffy but it isn't enough and he now needs 10 minutes to recover. In these 10 minutes Doffy easily finishes Luffy because Luffy can not even move. I know that was short but that's how it's going to be when they actually do fight. Also you cannot say that had Luffy known about Doffy's strength he would have used KKG from the start. One KKG is not enough to finish 60% Doffy. Kong Gun + Rhino Schneider + Culverin + Leo Bazooka = 80% power of King Kong gun (mainly because one extremely strong attack is better than 4 normal attacks). Still Luffy using KKG would deplete his Haki causing Gear 4 to end soon enough. I think that after using 2 KKGs Luffy would be immediately out of G4. So when he turned G4 he had 2 options; 1. Use KKG with the risk that if that misses he would be out of G4 soon and even if it hits he will still need another powerfull attack. Most probably KKG would miss because i think it is slower than KG etc. 2. Use more fast and sure to strike but weaker attacks. Luffy thinks maybe these are enough to defeat Doffy. So in the end one on one Doffy Vs Luffy ends with Doffy winning. Doffy is really close to Admiral level so don't take him easy. Luffy G5 using awakening will be admiral level."
