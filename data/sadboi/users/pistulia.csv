But back to this episode. When the Dothraki lights went out, even though I thought that was a weird, weird way for the Dothraki to go, the shot DID look beautiful. I really thought we were going to see a gorgeous, nail-biting, emotional war. I naively thought we might understand something about what motivates the white walkers and maybe Bran’s link to the past would be given more meaning by the end of the episode. I thought Tyrion might do SOMETHING intelligent again. I thought John and Dany riding into battle together on the dragons was going to be so much... more somehow. What we got was a visual disaster punctuated by the scene from Jurassic Park with the kids in the kitchen and the raptors, but with Aria and the white walkers instead. Aria killing the Night King was probably the only choice I thought was even remotely interesting, but given how meaningless the white walkers and the whole battle really was rendered at that point, it’s not much. Anyone else really think Bran was somehow gonna be the Night King??? smh."

In my head, I am telling my life story. I am telling somebody about how times were really really hard but I worked hard and overcame it. I hope my imaginary conversations I always act out will be a reality someday and I can tell people I persevered and achieved happiness and stability! But at the same time, it is sort of crazy that I spend SOOO much time acting out an imaginary moment in my head!"

I am also a woman. It deeply saddened me to see he was being equated to a woman when he is a man, but especially so because women in this office are clearly treated as much less than men. Respect peoples' gender identities and treat women equal to men. If I were a lawyer I would be calling every woman in this office right now."
