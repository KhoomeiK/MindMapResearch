It's not her responsibility to stop her friend from helping a man cheat. And likely, that friend is being manipulated by a charmer. 

The friend is still the AH. But your gf? She's awkward and caught in an awkward place. Telling her how you felt and still feel doesn't make you the asshole, but she sounds like she's uncomfortable with all of it and is afraid to proceed in any way that will alienate her friend."

But the idea started from realizing that a lot of people my age didn't have home ec or learn from their parents, so my co-host and I wanted to explore how to teach people how to cook, from scrambling an egg to making beef Wellington. The other side of the idea, the culture, is how people don't often know their culture and history, and can explore that through food. I married a hispanic man, and he and his family have been teaching me their culture, while also lamenting the fact that they don't know a good portion of their histories due to it being robbed from them. 

So it's both a how to show and a show about culture and family, and about how you can make your own culture if you come from an erased one, or even just a broken home (in my case). We both have been teaching in some way or another for years, and wrote a cookbook. Since cookbooks need names to be published, we figured, hey, let's make a show, and highlight education and community. 

It's not out yet, hence the attempted hype train, but we just got the go ahead and the kitchen and booked a bunch of our lovely friends as guests, so it's a real live thing now. I'm honestly terrified but so excited.
