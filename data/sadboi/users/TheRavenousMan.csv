Re modelling, again for a generalist understanding read Josh Rosenbaums investment banking book, gives good overview and will help in interviews for sure. 

I know the loans situation is a toughie, but if you can spend some of your own money investing in stocks. That way when you got to an ER interview you can bring along your performance history and show them you're truly passionate and skilled. (Even if you make a loss, it shows intent) 

Good luck"

Big4,feamxa3,t1_feak6as,1578950406.0,"Exits under FDD are typically to corporate finance (big 4/boutique/large advisor M&A, IB and PE less so but possible)

AAD I'm not too sure on, but I've not heard much about it so my guess would be it's not a structured sort of exit process (I.e. doesn't lead directly to anything).

Below relates to FDD:
Day to day is project based, if you're on a project expect long hours. If you're not, expect chill time.

As an intern, 99.9% sure you'll be doing grunt work but depends on the deal size you're on.

Vs audit, I would say FDD makes you a better accountant than audit as it's all very technical. Audit is good (or bad) in that it is cyclical and not project based busy. I wouldn't worry too much on audit vs DA for your internship. My advice would be do DA though as it's easier to transition into audit than it is into DA pre-qualified. Post qualified, quite easy to transition either way"
