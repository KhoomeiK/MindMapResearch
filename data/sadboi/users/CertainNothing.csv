I'm at CP 436

I recently got an Infused Necropotence lightning staff and I bought a pair of gold Bright Throat's Boast necklaces with AP. I was thinking I could trade these for the Necropotence jewelry and Inferno staff. I think one necklace would be worth the Inferno staff and another for some purple jewelry. I could just use Bright Throat instead of Necropotence, but I'm not sure. 

I have the Bloodthirsty trait researched on my rings, but would Infused still be the best option?

The thing that made the difference was having Immovability pots because the main reason I was dying, which wasn't often, was because I was constantly being CC'd. 

I just started a magicka Necro and I'm going to adapt my build for this class as well. I'm using Breton as my race for a multiple reasons. Magicka recovery, spell resistance, spell cost reduction, and maximum magicka. The main form of healing I'm planning on using is a combination of Hungry Scythe, Summoners Armor, and Spirit Guardian. Hungry Scythe will be my primary heal, Summoners Armor will provide Major Ward, Major Resolve, and a 12% reduction for your Spirit Guardian. Spirit Guardian will heal you over time, but it's main function is that 10% of the damage you take will be transferred to it instead. With the cost reduction from Summoners Armor, racial passives, and the class passives, it should be an extremely cheap skill and you should be able to have it up all the time.

The best advice I can give is to just find a class that interests you and get through it. It'll suck, but it'll be worth it in the end. Because unless you magically start to enjoy Necro, it'll always leave this sour taste in your mouth and be this unpleasant feeling in the back of your head.

A player could aggro mobs while trying to pick a chest and get knocked out of the animation. Meanwhile you stealth past them and take the chest for yourself. Don't concern yourself with the notion of ""first come, first serve."" That's nonsense. If that player couldn't protect the chest or nuke the ads fast enough to get the chest before someone else showed up, that's their fault. I'm not going to stand next to a Master chest in Rivenspire while some dude fights a Troll and wait for him to loot it. I'll pick the chest while they're fighting.

That chest could have a Necropotence fire staff in it. I'm not passing on the chance because you can be sure nobody else would. People will steal a chest from you and tbag after looting it. 

There's CP passives that'll increase the quality of items in chests as well. You should also loot any alchemy reagents and materials while you're at it.

Edit: The quality of a chest affects the odds of a set piece being in it. In certain areas there's an abundance of chests in a close proximity and sometimes it's better to pass on that Simple chest if there's another player farming.

elderscrollsonline,fewvjvy,t3_eqi2fj,1579420159.0,"People sometimes talk about being overwhelmed at the start, but honestly it's fairly simple if you take it one step at a time. In my opinion you should make reaching level 50 and completing the main story your first goal. Get your armor skill lines unlocked and start levelling them alongside you class skill lines. You also want to join the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild. You'll make progress on those naturally by just playing. 

Quest through your Alliance zones and then you can start going through the other Alliance zones. 

Them just keep playing, levelling skills, and work your way to CP 160."

It seems to me that she feels like she has to choose between her extreme veganism and friendship with you. She wants to remain friends, but at the same time she shames people who don't conform to her lifestyle choice and that's not something someone does to a friend. 

You need to have a serious talk with her and make it clear that she'll be responsible for torpedoing your friendship with her vegan zealotry. You're not somehow ruining the friendship because you don't want to be vegan anymore. 

Matter of fact, by her dismissal if your health issues associated with a vegan diet, it seems like veganism is more important to her than you are."

She can get over it. It's not tacky or weird. You're not even living together or married and she's already trying to tell you what to do. You can reach a compromise where maybe you keep it elsewhere on display, but not put away."

Your step daughter doesn't like you and she doesn't give a damn about your daughter that passed away or honoring her wishes/memory. She's thinking only about herself in this situation and what she stands to gain.

However if you somehow, for whatever reason, decided she should get some of that money that she's not entitled to, I wouldn't give her $13,000. At the most I'd give her $3,000. If that's not good enough, you can just donate the whole amount to charity.

I'd personally tell her to pound sand, but then again I don't have to live with them either. It's a shit situation any way you look at it."
