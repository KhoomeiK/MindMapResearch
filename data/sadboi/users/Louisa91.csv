Love her to bits, but things'll still get to me 
The garden sounds like a nice reprieve, I'm sure it looks amazing (spring there now right??) 
Kind of curious to see 

Thanks for the opportunity btw, appreciate you spreading some love and positive vibes üíô"

Gives your body time to reign in your skin as you lose weight (I‚Äôm terrified of saggy skin when I‚Äôm finally down to my goal bod)

Thank you! I‚Äôll check it out!"

Not sure where you live, but if you can try and see your gyno asap. They sometimes make exceptions for certain situations here to travel. Suffering for any kind of reason isn't an acceptable way to live, whether it's pain or worry or whatever 

And it's my right (dominant side) shoulder that's affected, trust me I'm trying to rest it, but obviously with some things it's unavoidable to use so I'm in pain a lot. 
Gonna try and find a way to maybe tape/wrap it down so I can exercise without instinctively using my arm.

Thanks for everything!"
IF_Petites,fnd6duz,t1_fnd5zay,1586860528.0,"Eh I'm in South Africa, our hospitals aren't that great and even the private practices took 16 years to diagnose me to begin with.

Most trainers just show me away too which kinda sucks

Still working on it though! Been struggling with calcifying tendinitis so I've taken a break from exercising (had an appointment with a surgeon that was supposed to happen the day after the lockdown started here üôÉ)

Do you maybe have some links for me for those upper body exercises? 

Eery how much you and I have in common! I had major leg surgeries a few years back too"
