I downloaded a tracker yesterday to help me quit tobacco/MJ too. Hopefully this weekend will be my first 100% sober.

My boyfriend has left me but I think I'm going to be OK. We have to live together until the end of lockdown at least. 

He will probably cope with the break up by drinking a lot. It's going to be hard to watch. 

This sounds awful - it's obviously upsetting and sad - but I'm also excited to start a sober life where nothing holds me back. if I do eventually date someone else in the future I will choose someone sober or at least supportive of my sobriety. There are no more excuses not to do this long term.

Sending all my love folks. Take care x"

Where males would hunt, females would have been in charge of gathering fruits/nuts/seeds. Some evolutionary theorists posit that this is why women tend to be better at distinguishing colours from each other - to be able to sort poisonous fruits from edible ones.

Fruits/nuts/seeds do have a much lower caloric count than meat, but contain nutrients and fibre essential to the diet, and cover times of unsuccessful hunt. 

Calling meat “higher quality” is correct in caloric terms, but a balanced diet contains more than that.

Interesting study however and I enjoyed the read."

serialpodcastorigins,ewognva,t1_elpz834,1565617485.0,"Hello, I do - though it’s been a while since you asked this, and it’s more of a technical question about AOL platform as I didn’t really use it.

Would Hae’s update referencing Don have come up on a news feed type thing for Adnan? Or would he have had to actively go into her profile, and be checking up on her to see it? (potentially stalking her on social media). The latter isn’t uncommon, I know I’ve done it after relationships have ended, but it smacks of unhealthy and definitely not being over someone. 

Doesn’t change my opinion that in all likelihood he would have seen it and that it would have been infuriating to him. 

Im trying to understand how he might have come across it, as it may have been a bit more emotive for him if he hadn’t actively been seeking out the information, and it had just popped up on his screen when he signed in (for example)

Alternatively, if he only could have seen it by actively going into her profile, that might say that he found it through looking for clues that she was dating someone new, that someone might have told him about the new relationship, or that her behaviour towards him had changed. And was vindicated.

Hope this makes sense and isn’t too rambly. I’m not sure if it would change anything but interesting to know how he would have seen it, if he had as we assume.

If you experience any coercion, either from mum or dad, you should also let the court know during your testimony. This includes any vitriol your mum might send via message (though I hope she doesn’t). Tampering with witness testimony is a massive no-no.

You or dad can contact the hearing court and arrange special measures if you feel less able to testify while she is in the room. Most places you an attend by video link from a different room, or have screens put up so you don’t have to see the person you’re testifying against.
