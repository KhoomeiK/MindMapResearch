The stress from caregiving is brutal & no medication even slows it down for me. It hits you in so many ways. I will be putting her into nursing soon. I can't believe im still here after doing this so long.

 I thought divorce was tough but it was nothing compared to years of caregiving. I hope I can have some kind of life after this."

 You could put an alarm under her bed and get bed rails. I bought an alarm on Amazon (Smart Caregiver TL-5102mp) that has motion sensors and a pager that is really loud so I can sleep in the other end of the house. It doesn't make any noise in her room but the pager is really loud & will go off if anything crosses the beam. Before I bought that I slept where I could see her & got maybe 4hrs a night because every noise woke me up. It has been a lifesaver for me. I bet that and bed rails would work great for you."

dementia,fiwb89q,t3_f7k1sd,1582780073.0,When my Mom was diagnosed the social worker told me I would need a lot of help because the stress is so bad that 40% of caregivers die before the Dementia sufferer. I didn't believe her and thought it wouldn't be bad. Man was I wrong. I also thought at her age that she was more likely to pass away from something else before it got bad. I was wrong.  We are still here though.
dementia,fiwagz1,t3_eyxabv,1582779435.0,"I have cared for my mom with Dementia for several years and at the point of nursing but still figuring out how to pay. She was in the hospital for a week but Medicare wouldn't cover any nursing care because it was decided she wouldn't benefit from rehab, which is ridiculous.

 I brought her back home & we are doing ok but the week she was in the hospital i couldn't make myself go anywhere but to see her. I used to have all these hobbies outdoors but didn't want to go anywhere. For years I wished I could do those things yet when i was free to do them i couldn't. It's like Dementia has already killed me. 

 I am 50 and had a physical today. When the Doctor told me about my lab work I was hoping there would be something terminal there. Nope, I'm in excellent shape he said.


It is horrible & I promised my son he would not have to do this for me. I don't want him or anyone to feel like I do. I take great care of my Mom and we can still have conversations but it has been exhausting and painful to watch her go downhill."

Sitting around the house doing nothing is the worse thing for depressed people.
depression,fdjjbh4,t3_elpwxv,1578473457.0,I would like to know the answer to this myself.  All the SSRI'S make me want to lay around the house. I've taken a few that made me not care about anything and Paxil made me crave alcohol everytime I was on it.  None of them have ever made me happy or positive and the side effects just made things worse.  I guess they work for some people.
depression,fdjipp3,t3_elpzet,1578472638.0,"I'm the same way. It's just overanalyzing and over thinking every comment, look or whatever I get from people. I've been this way since the 80s and 99.9% of the time i was reading people wrong & it had nothing to do with me. It definitely wears you out overanalyzing everything. 

 Depression/anxiety causes paranoia, worry and all kinds of crap. I have Gad/ocpd & if I could stop the overanalyzing & constant worry I would be ok. Klonopin has been the only thing that slows it down for me. It's just not good to take long term."

 All those people that called and texted care about you and with you being so young there is a lot to live for even though you can't see it now. You might be embarrassed that everyone knows but that will go away and be forgotten. I still have depression but became the person that family members called when they were depressed over the years because they knew I had been through it. I'm glad you are still here. 

 If I would have succeeded back then I would have missed out on so many good times & I was 32. If I could go back to 17 I would put everything into my schooling and doing my best to be in excellent shape. Skip any partying & be good to everyone.

There has to be some kind of hobby you are interested in, just have to find what it is.

 At 20 years old you havent wasted anything.  Your life is just getting started even if you can't see that right now.  There's so many people that spent their lives as addicts, in prison & people who failed until they were over the hill but ended up doing great things. There's nothing saying you have to date anyone.

 I wore an expensive toupee weaved into my hair until I was 21. It was a huge pain in the ass.  Finally I cut that thing off and just shaved it off on the sides. After that all the problems from being bald went away completely.

 Didn't have any problems getting dates (I was shocked).  My head is also really pointed on top and used to look bad to me. It also sure is easy to shower!  Just a bar of soap and a washcloth!  I wear a hat a lot to avoid sunburn and in the cold.  Shave it off or keep some stubble on the sides and face and I bet you will soon be fine being bald.  You could even lift weights, get in great shape and look like a total badass with the baldness!

SuicideWatch,ez3w26k,t3_czwnjp,1567676195.0,I'm not much but I'm praying for you and i know it will help.  Not much we can do about past relationships but I bet you will find love again and maybe even better than before.
SuicideWatch,ez3uspm,t3_czmaf3,1567675328.0,Im not great with words but I think your story will help a lot of people. It's awesome that things have turned around for you & will keep getting better. I'm proud of you and will be praying for you.
SuicideWatch,ez215yv,t1_ez0xusk,1567651976.0,Excellent post. My life seems pointless most of the time and coming to forums like these is like group therapy. I see I'm not the only one suffering and end up wanting to help others.
Alzheimers,evtiifz,t1_evtdvfm,1564771129.0,"It's a scary thought but I just try to make it through each day. I doubt it will be tougher than being a caregiver. I'm gonna have to make the decision about nursing soon or its gonna drag me down with it. I stay in shape physically but mentally it is impossible. 

 I've had depression for many years but nothing compares to caregiver stress. It's been over 4 years since I've had a day away from here. My psychologist said if I make it through this nothing will bother me again. He is probably right. My mom does the best she can but it's a constant roller coaster.  I know if I ever get Alzheimer's no family member will have to take care of me."
Alzheimers,evt8pao,t1_evrctho,1564765178.0,This is what has happened to me. I'm 49 & taking care of my 83yr old mother has consumed my entire life for the last 4yrs. Even when I can get away for 3 or 4 hours it never leaves my mind. It is brutal & I can't keep doing this. The depression is unbelievable.
depression,eujbmue,t3_cgosut,1563867444.0,Go for it!  Coming here can bring me down but I might leave a comment that helps someone else. Good luck!
depression,eujao1g,t1_euj67m3,1563866755.0,"Same with me, bothered me for awhile but then I just shaved it off. This was 30 years ago before shaved heads were cool. I never had a problem getting dates and it's easy to keep clean. I also dont have to go to the barber."
depression,eugnfjp,t3_cg7kvp,1563811310.0,Les Brown is great. There are a lot of good motivational videos on Youtube.
depression,euduvuk,t1_eu9t40m,1563728120.0,I know what you're saying. I feel the same way.
depression,eu9qy1h,t1_eu9pqi6,1563588208.0,I'd just wait and see if she responds. If she doesn't you'll find another one. If she was interested in you then you know others will be too. She might just be scatter brained.
depression,eu816ay,t1_eu7ugwa,1563547504.0,I feel the same way.
depression,eu5dyjx,t3_celn0u,1563475512.0,Yeah a trip to a hiking area or climbing a mountain is a good idea.
depression,etzmaca,t3_ce5j3d,1563333727.0,I go for walks/hikes. I always pick up trash along the way. I usually feel better halfway through my hike.
depression,etzln8v,t3_ce766o,1563333472.0,I bet we help people every day and don't even know it. I had a patient once that was one of the bomber pilots that flew in the first attack over Berlin. He really had some stories. Thanks for being there for him.
depression,etut52p,t1_etupttp,1563219471.0,I haven't overcame it. I still face it every day. I just keep going because of my family and pray that it will get better.  If you dont give up and fight there will be a lot of good times ahead.
depression,etujpwh,t3_cddmxn,1563213995.0,"I know how you feel but we can't change the past.  If we sit around depressed and drink/over eat or whatever then we will be looking back regretting that someday.

 Maybe try going the other direction and be the best you can be.  We are still alive so we might as well make the best of it."
depression,etuirle,t3_cdjd0e,1563213439.0, I dont know what to say to make you feel better mentally but it's great that the health problems got better.
depression,etuicqw,t3_cdf2qe,1563213198.0,"Great job, you just have to get up and go and things get better."
