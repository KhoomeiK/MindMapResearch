bipolar,fo6oejz,t1_fo56c36,1587563538.0,"Well. 
I don't want to say you can't, but I would advise being taught dbt by professional.

The group setting I had wasn't a free for all of people talking until it was over. I had a professional teach the group and talk at us and if it were asked, we gave input. I had individual sessions with DBT as well. Based on my personal experience, I was triggered from just reading things and had melt downs pushing through in group/solo/at home doing the paperwork. The other thing I would like to say is that I personally misunderstood the readings based on my misguided beliefs at the time but the professional guided me to help understand correctly. 
Also it felt great admitting the days I couldnt stomach the paper work and having a chance to say why. 
I also feel like it prepared me for cbt because I think that's way harder in my experience. 
I hope this helps"
bipolar,fo3fskq,t3_g5hdm8,1587486165.0,"I think therapy, and anything doc related are individual experiences. 
I say this because my point of view for doc related stuff changes way too much to think one way or the other about it. 
I personally feel a sense of responsibility to society/others to make the effort to be productive and all that good stuff. 
However, I'm still human. That said, not everything in life can be dictated in the moment with tools provided from resources available to me for every time life decides to be a pos. 

I think the best thing to do is have an open mind. 
I am personally not convinced that within 107 years, these french/Euro docs suddenly discovered bipolar. 
1950's-1970s America was dealing with getting mental health advocated for as a whole/dealing with horrible looney house conditions, and I'm supposed to just accept that this condition is just is? 
My theory is it's environment related but I'm told no so far. 
I was diagnosed in 2015. Bipolar day was established in 2014. From 2014- present I never heard a peep about this day until I got the nerve to come to Reddit. 
The webpage established for that group... Simply put.... Is dated. All these rich/smart docs and they can't put together a webpage in the year of 2020?


Until we the humans of Earth can have information available to us, (including the info withheld for the greater good bull)I still support DBT/group &solo therapy and med combos. 


DBT= dialectical behavioral therapy
This was only intended for those with boarderline personality disorder.... However it extends to PTSD/bipolar/depression/anxiety as well because this group helps get rid of beliefs in place that you don't need anymore, helps keep you in the now instead of in your head forever. I struggle with relationships altogether - this therapy helps with interacting better. I'm sure there's more I'm missing but... Still worth the effort to listen and gain tools/new perspective. 
Worse that can happen is it gets you out the house and forces you to think about new stuff. 

Um. 
End rant? My bad. That's a lot of that right there but that's my opinion."
Veterans,fmb8z52,t1_fmaih6o,1585921343.0,"You know, I had a quick cnp compared to others, but I too got a letter in the mail saying they couldn't read what I wrote and sent the check to my home state address ( I used my parents address for tax info stuff while active.) I would double check the mail for that letter and follow the steps. Also, if you are able to get on the ebenfits, go look at dd214 for that address and make sure they didn't send anything to that. I'm almost positive they wouldnt considering he's VA enrolled. But just to cover bases. 
I hope this helps!"
bipolar,fmb6lrk,t3_fu0793,1585919689.0,"Accept your feelings and remember you are human too with the right to feel. Cry. Throw the pillow. Shower/bath for an hour. Phone a friend/resource. Don't damn yourself. 
Also gratitude list works.
Like: I'm thankful that I have the brain function to be aware and conscious of my surroundings.
         I'm thankful my fingers and toes are working and in the right spot
         I'm thankful I got ppl in my life at the least willing to listen to me and my crazy stuff. 

Hope this helps! 
PS you're doing great!"
Veterans,fmb5yu3,t3_fu3za9,1585919217.0,"I used ebenfits. As far as finding out to qualify, there could be numbers on their webpage to start with. 
When you use ebenfits, there's an option to print out the certificate you take to the bank and it tells you what's available to you and if you have to pay the VA loan fee or not. 
(I believe the fee is reduced/waived based on disability rating?) 
I would try with that and see if that gets you in the right direction at least."

Used to stay up while my dad slept on big rig trips to make sure no one tried stealing the truck.  Scan the house with the biggest knife for noises. Probably was a sign or two lol."
