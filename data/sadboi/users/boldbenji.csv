thebachelor,fe98nj6,t3_eo5kty,1578935393.0,If he chooses someone and even get engaged with them they will probably already be broken up at atfr because she watched the first two episodes and nobody wants a fiance that is in love with his ex. Then they'll ask hannah about it at atfr and she'll be embarrassed but then peter asks her out and they live happily ever after. The end.

thebachelor,f7eb2rw,t3_dvn7f1,1573652792.0,They are my fav bachelor couple so I'm totally in denial about this. I convinced myself that they are just not into instagram that much and that they enjoy the time they spend together without being on their phones and posting stuff all the time. I do the same with my bf but obviously our relationship didnt start so publicly so that's not the same.
thebachelor,f4ngi20,t1_f4nf0i7,1571689200.0,Same. Chris Harrison is $625.
thebachelor,f3xisfr,t1_f3xfkry,1571238966.0,"I also never wanted him to be the bachelor because he is cringey. I'm not a POC, I just know that there are less cringey and more fun human beings from every race. I really hope there'll be a black bachelor in the near future but bnt just anyone just for the sake of having a poc as a lead. 

I dont know if Peter is a great choice, but I find him adorable and hope he'll be adorable on his season."

thebachelor,f36kfdf,t1_f36h88e,1570713619.0,He weighs 70lbs. We live in Europe so chewy is not an option for us. I found a bed for around 200$ and I'm going to save money to buy it. He sleeps in my bed at night anyway haha.
thebachelor,f33upko,t3_dfky34,1570645494.0,An orthopedic dog bed lol. My boy jack has hip dysplasia and needs a decent bed but I dont have the money at the moment.
thebachelor,f30xv28,t3_df4ia3,1570564379.0,"Oh n, I feel so sorry for Peter, 22 stitches really is no small injury and I hope he'll recover soon. Sounds like a total nightmare. 

I wonder how tptb will handle this. He will likely miss a few days of filming and I guess he won't be able to go on too adventures dates in the next weeks. Plus the bus scar he will have on his face and I dont think they can put make up on a wound that's in the process of healing?"

thebachelor,f0v0iik,t3_d6m0ky,1568957774.0,I have severe migraine and get botox as a therapy ever 3 months. Can't move my forehead since I started the treatment and I don't like that feeling at all. In the beginning it even caused panic attacks. So for me botox would not be an option for cosmetically treatment. If she Kaitlyn likes it then good for her. Shilling botox still feels weird to me though.
thebachelor,f0md0vh,t1_f0mbwsm,1568742188.0,It may be only 104 days in our calendar but in bachelor nation's calendar that's like 3 years

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ewyv05j,t1_ewytu4n,1565887174.0,"When they tried to put on the cone at the vet he panicked, so I walked him home without it. And since he didnt even try to lick the wound, i spared him the embarrassment in front of his best friend. He'll wear it at night though."
thebachelor,ew70gq4,t3_cn2wq0,1565184064.0,"Tyler is allowed to date whoever's he wants to date but clearly hannah is hurt by how publicly he dates gigi just days after their sleepover. He was always emphasizing how much respect he has for Hannah and I think if he really cares about her feelings and happiness so much, he could have handled the situation better. Still a hannah Stanley but a little disappointed by Tyler's actions."
