Denver,fp9z0wx,t3_gc7uv4,1588437492.0,"While I understand your position, I'm disabled and have a lot of trouble accessing the park when the roads are closed.

I can't walk more than two blocks without having to stop and rest. Many other disabled people have this issue. Some of the sidewalks in the surrounding areas aren't very accessible. There's not enough handicap parking in the neighborhoods close to the park either. 

If I had to park three blocks from the park I wouldn't be able to go.

I think it would be nicer with no cars. However, removing car access for the park makes it inaccessible to many handicapped people like me. 

I would prefer that every person, regardless of their ability, can enjoy our public parks."

I used to have energy, work out a lot, go out with friends. I swam and smiled and had a ton of interests and was interesting and beautiful.

I've gained 30 pounds in the past couple years. I'm constantly in pain. I can't focus on my work. I don't want to leave the house because it hurts too much. I can't really afford to anyways, I spend so much on medical bills.

I try to fake my way through the day. I spend multiple hours crying at my desk. I'm so depressed and sad inside and there is no one to talk to.
