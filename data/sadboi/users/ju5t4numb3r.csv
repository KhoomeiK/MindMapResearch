depression,eyywied,t3_czkrsx,1567603747.0,"Uh maybe you have a personality disorder. I know nothing about psychology so take that with a grain of salt.

Also why delete your post? The freedom to share your thoughts, feelings, ideas, etc. is what the world wide web is all about."
depression,eyxgaha,t3_czcd43,1567552602.0,"I could relate to this so much a few years ago... Like you, I self medicated for a long time and eventually addiction ruined my life. Today I realize that I took a lot for granted and did wrong to those I loved. The way I placed substance above anyone and everything else in my life back then destroyed everything I have ever cared about.

Its really a shitty feeling to wake up and realize that everyday. Shit, I'll just say don't let alcohol or drugs take over your life... because everything you currently have now can be taken away in what seems like a blink of an eye."

As the other poster mentioned, try taking better care of yourself. Personal hygiene takes some amount of effort and discipline... if you take small steps to achieve small goals like showering everyday(if possible) and brushing your teeth you'll feel some sense of accomplishment.
