I used to work for the court system and my youngest brother is adopted. I know some about how these kinds of adoptions work. Its not too late for her to keep her baby and if I knew the state she's in l can provide valid links to great local resources that can help before her court date where she signs her rights over for good."

So you absolutely have my thoughts and prayers on that, in complete seriousness. I'm so glad he came home. 

A friend of mine, after this whole year of trying to figure out the path to follow to grieve on this twisted winding road, said the one thing to me, on the one year date, that actually made any difference. He said that no matter what our relationship was like after, no matter how we fought or how things ended up, she may have not liked me my entire life... But.... She never ever forget how it felt the very first time she held her first born. And that resonated. My teenager thinks I'm on his case a lot, and drives me nuts sometimes just because he's a young teen and I'm a mom. But even if we're upset with each other, I still feel his little feet kicking the first time and see that huge baby they tried to swaddle in the hospital break free like the Hulk right before they put him in my arms. Nothing we do or say can change that. So looking at it from this perspective helps me. My son and I are super close and nothing like my mom/big sister and I. But even through the mildly turbulent moments we go though (he's 14 so I'm sure the water will get rougher before it calms though, lol), I keep my upbringing in my mind so history isn't repeated. Blessedly, I landed in a wonderful place with my grandparents and they were amazing. Things calmed (until they were gone and my monther cranked it up to 11). It's nice to be able to get on here feeling one way, then some random internet stranger just gets it and helps you feel so much better and not alone. Thank you."

I'm glad but also sad that someone else relates. My mom wasn't absent from my life. But she did kick me out when I was 13. I lived with my grandparents, but until I was 18 she lived across the street. My siblings and I held tight to each other and still do. Even the one 17 years younger than me is my best friend.

It's so positively overwhelming, I'm so humbled and blessed and more thankful than I can ever attempt to express fully. No matter how I felt trying to post this initially, my children above all were the strength I used to type it out. They're so beyond amazing, and I pictured their faces tomorrow without anything and couldn't NOT post to ask help. I was laid off yesterday, and before that my hours were cut to nearly nothing. I was thankful for the few hours I had because so many are out of work. I thought my paycheck had 8 hours on it for the past two weeks but didn't realize they fell in different pay periods until last night when my check was deposited for 3 hours total, which after tax was pretty well enough for just over a 1/4 tank of gas. I could've made the 8 hours work that I thought was going to be on this check I think, so that's why I waited until the last minute to post, because I didn't know until last night that I needed help.
