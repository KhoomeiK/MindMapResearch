But with no paid sick leave, most of us just can‚Äôt afford to call out more than one day. And since we have such a large staff, illness spreads quickly. Last year, I‚Äôm fairly certain I got three different strains of a viral cold over the course of a month or so because it mutated and would come back around."

AnxietyDepression,fjxpx71,t3_ff73at,1583680513.0,"When I get in that state, I try to allow myself that time in bed but still limit it. For example, I will set a timer for say, 45 minutes. When that 45 minutes is up, I get up to accomplish one task- just one small one, like washing the dishes or making a phone call. Then I allow myself to go back to bed for 45 minutes, then another small task. 

It‚Äôs baby steps. 

It‚Äôs also important to remember that you staying in bed, that IS self care. Self care is what feels good to you."

I want to move into an apartment by myself. But everything where I live is expensive. I‚Äôm willing to get a second job. But I worry that I won‚Äôt be approved for an apartment due to my income. And I worry that getting a second job won‚Äôt be as easy as I want it to be. 

Then today, I saw that one of my classmates from my childhood lost her husband yesterday. They have two young daughters. I‚Äôm heartbroken for them. 

And I‚Äôm frustrated that my depression feels like selfishness at times."
