But if you were misbehaving constantly as a child, then maybe his smacking didn't work? There are multiple studies that show it isn't a necessary part of discipline. The studies are all accurate in that a lot of people who were beaten or spanked later believe that is is necessary to do that to kids, and adults too... I always think that if you believe that smacking another adult is incorrect unless in self defence, why is it right to smack kids? They're even smaller and cannot defend themselves."

I dunno man, everything I've been learned from watching other people and reading about it makes me conclude that it's not something people should do.

I don't doubt that you want what's best for your kid and you sound like a fairly good parent. I'll never be able to agree with spanking tho, though I've said enough on it already."

JusticeServed,fojfihm,t1_fojeu9h,1587819431.0,"I'm not implying that you do beat him. I'm just trying to argue the case of why I think that spanking is unnecessary. It just seems like a way of showing the child ""I am angry with you, so I'm going to smack you a few times to show you."" Just, what is that teaching the child? That you show your anger to others by smacking? From this: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/04/spanking

""A study published last year in Child Abuse and Neglect revealed an intergenerational cycle of violence in homes where physical punishment was used. Researchers interviewed parents and children age 3 to 7 from more than 100 families. Children who were physically punished were more likely to endorse hitting as a means of resolving their conflicts with peers and siblings. Parents who had experienced frequent physical punishment during their childhood were more likely to believe it was acceptable, and they frequently spanked their children. Their children, in turn, often believed spanking was an appropriate disciplinary method.""
There are many others that show similar findings, and I find it to be true also in my experience. All I'm saying is, maybe rethink if you should be spanking him. It's okay to change your mind about it. Parenting is a learning process, and I think we can all strive to be better in every aspect of life."
JusticeServed,foje3pf,t1_fojd2fx,1587818207.0,"Well firstly, if I thought my child was that fixated on an object that they wouldn't stop trying to find it and potentially break it, I would remove that object from the child's reach indefinitely. I have been raised with a family that had a lot of young children, and one thing I've learned is that if I were to simply hit them on the ass, there's no way in hell that's going to stop them from getting the object at some other point. Kids don't learn like that. If they actually got their hands on it after I knew how much they wanted it, I'd probably feel like a bit of a clown for not removing it from their reach in the first place. 
They would likely go into time out after I've explained to them, in words they can best understand, why breaking that object was wrong, and how they've upset me because of it. I'd ask them if they'd be upset if someone broke their favourite toy (basically driving a lesson home of how their actions impact others). Perhaps I would take away their favourite toy for a few days (tablets seem to be the favourite of most children nowadays). These methods aren't perfect, no. But spanking them, what will I achieve there? It's not going to turn my child into a better person. They're just kids, they don't think in profound ways, or think ahead of their actions. I think everybody would benefit from parenting classes, if you take offense to that then I think your approach to parenting is wrong."
