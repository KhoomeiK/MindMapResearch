AskReddit,fpd5cvj,t1_fpceabn,1588520173.0,">""nice"" isn't a personality

I seriously think this is part of the dissonance between incels and everyone else.

I think some naive guys think ""nice guy"" is the apex of Personality and so all rejection is because of physicality.  It's not.  ""Nice Guy"" is a vacuum of personality; it means ""This guy always holds the door and is really polite so I feel bad about calling him boring or creepy"".  

If you can think of *anything else* about a person you'd say it before Nice Guy.  Funny?  Charming?  Smart?  If someone calls you a Nice Guy it means that you haven't demonstrated to them that you are funny, charming or smart.  Or have any physical traits to take the place.  Polite?  I mean, that's probably better than Nice, but it's Nice-adjacent.

And it doesn't mean that you *aren't* funny, charming or smart, it just means that your personality has really taken a back seat in how you engage with people, and... well, people don't engage with manners, people engage with personality.  *By slamming the door in someone's face you are showing more personality*.  It's probably something most people won't *want* to engage with, but there's something there and there's probably one or two thirsty mofos who will like the attention.

Nice guys: stop being nice.  Be decent people if it matters to you, but act through empathy and not rules.

(And yes, some people are good looking enough to get away with acting like a Nice Guy.  People are attracted to physicality, don't worry about it, you don't have to let it rule your life.)"

She asked you out.  These people are flirting at her, but she's not flirting back.  By your account she's showing you nothing but loyalty, and honestly that's the only kind of security there is in relationships.  And while it's human nature to worry about losing something you value, if you insisted on... setting a sign up outside shop, to put it crudely, then you'd be throwing that back in her face.

On top of that, she's not your possession - as much as she feels like something that you can lose.  Demanding that you're flaunted as her boyfriend could likely, to her, feel like you're claiming ownership or dominance and that's not how it goes.

In my experience, the side of you that you feed becomes you.  Don't imagine that just by appearing on her feed, this impulse will go away.  If you indulge your insecurities then you'll clutch harder to what you treasure, and sometimes hard enough to destroy it.  My advice is to tell her that you value her company, so these things make you feel a little jealous, but you trust her, and let her bear your feelings in mind as she sees fit; because I think that's how a healthy relationship deals with issues like this."

The reason that I'm reluctant to jump on the bandwagon here is that I think it may be the case that we're quite far off the point at which it makes any difference to health at all (apart from people who are especially sensitive and their neighbours would hopefully know and consider them), and that really not that many people even want to have a garden fire.

However, Fortnite is full of twelve year olds who act like pissy little bitches and play it constantly.  It also uses these children as leverage to extract cash from their parents.  Bit sinister.

Animal Crossing is a wholesome mutually enjoyable game that severely limits interaction in order to protect adults from the predatory children who also share the online space."

The spivs, the opportunists and the people who wanted to lie down and give up were around then, and they're around now.  In the depression they didn't even have the perceived opportunity to just stop and go back to ""normal"" and pretend it wasn't happening.  

Frankly a lot of people didn't think we could achieve what we have; without a vaccine, many countries are turning the tide of a pandemic.  We need to help the ones who aren't, but this is an amazing accomplishment for a society, and would have been unthinkable at any other time in history.

It's okay to be disappointed where it's called for.  But be proud, too.  Don't forget the people who are risking their lives to save others, the communities that have sprung up to support each other, and, yes, the businesses that are taking real damage to maintain the safety of their workers.  People *are* dying.  We have to remember what we're fighting to save to make it mean something."
ukpolitics,fo6ezfb,t3_g5vyoq,1587556881.0,"I think there's a real disconnect between what some people think they're owed and how they have to be with Covid.

Like, people complaining that restaurants are shut.  That it's not fair that schoolkids studying their exams this year are going to be kinda screwed over.  And the simple fact is that *it's not fair*.  Governments are doing all they can to keep society running but this is a fucking global pandemic and it's amazing that we're still functioning as well as we are, and that many countries seem to be turning the tide of it *without a bloody vaccine*.

People *can't* be compensated to 100% of their inconvenience; it's not the government, or businesses, that are responsible for it, and both are being hit really hard financially.  We're all paying a grievous price in commerce so that it doesn't have to be paid in blood.  In an ideally fair world, everyone would be equally inconvenienced, and bear in mind that a lot of people are *fucking dying*, so factor that into your estimation of how much bullshit you should face as a result of this.

I'm all for providing support for students who need it but saying that universities owe you a refund because the entire planet is undergoing emergency measures and you didn't get to talk to your lecturer in person is just... entitled, and disconnected from the reality of the sacrifices being made here."

The most visually spectacular gig I've ever seen, they played all the songs you'd want to hear, each song had its own devoted lightshow, and they sounded just as good as the album.

They had a sort of... curtain of light that descended between members of the band, made of individual lights that started unilluminated and created a shadowy curtain, then blinding light, then started showing images...  They were still rolling out new shit in the encore.

It was pricey but by god it was worth it."
