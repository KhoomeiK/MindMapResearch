Positivity,fqyz8ti,t3_gliqwx,1589757107.0,"I really don't like the 'find your passion' narrative. It's awesome when you find things that you love and that make you feel engaged with life. That's part of what makes life worth living. But imo there is no 'one passion' to find that will suddenly solve everything.

I feel like there is too much pressure on people, particularly young adults, to find their 'passion'. What you are passionate about will change over time. It will come from different areas of your life at different times. 

It's great if you are one of those people who found a single passion or direction to pursue. Go for it! But many do not. I wish I had known earlier that if you haven't 'found your passion' there's nothing wrong with you and you can still be happy."

I'm guessing here but I doubt he would describe it that way because he doesn't want to think of himself badly. It sounds a little like he's trying to shift the blame on to you.

The important thing to note is you were clear with him that you didn't want to go further, and he went ahead anyway. Knowingly. Without your consent. His self esteem or whatever reason why is not important.

AskReddit,fpxduiy,t1_fpwx221,1588980744.0,"""It's okay not to be nice sometimes"". Really true, better rude than dead. There's sometimes so much pressure to not offend someone or be perceived as a bitch, it's easy to end up in a bad situation very quickly.

Fortunately I've lived to tell the tale, but I've ended up in a couple of potentially risky or just unwanted situations because I was too afraid to rock the boat. If the person is decent that generally won't cross boundaries (e.g. unlocking the car) and if they do it by accident they will be apologetic and not do it again (not applicable to this situation, but applies more generally). We can spend time trying not to offend people who don't care or would only too quickly take what they could given the opportunity. It's taken me a long time to learn it and I still have trouble realising it, the urge to be 'nice' is so strong."

Otherwise I find other physical things can help a little. Stroking pets, weighted blanket, teddies, hot water bottles. Anything that gives you that hugging sensation. Appreciate it's not the same though.

Also things like yoga or exercise because they generically make your body feel good. Hope that helps in some way, but you're definitely not alone."

Anxiety,f9tlw7e,t3_e6x6kx,1575631279.0,"I completely understand your concern. TLDR at bottom.

I'm on a low dose rn, and like you I was so worried. I was out of my mind with anxiety when I first started taking them.

The first type made me feel sick so I stopped after a couple of days. The second, I felt sick and really tired (but that could have been anxiety!) And I felt a bit weird. But then it all just calmed down, and I'm like why the big deal? Now I don't notice I'm taking them.

They took a little while (couple mths) to work, but I do think they helped me. I think my body needed the boost because I couldn't do it on my own.

Remember just because you start taking them you can stop too. If it's only a couple of days you might not even have to taper.

I'm used to it now, but initially it suddenly felt like life was so much more fun! I can enjoy a meal or lying in bed or talk to my friends and actually *feel* something

I also got a bit more outgoing and a bit less cautious. 

I haven't put on weight.

That's not to say that everything is fixed or my anxiety is gone. And I will still have to taper off in the future, so we'll see how that goes. 

They are definitely not *the* solution IMO, although it may be for some. But I think they may be a helpful crutch while you are struggling. 

tldr: my worries were vastly overblown, and I do feel better than I did. But not 'fixed'."
