truelesbians,fqrz365,t3_gkiel4,1589594976.0,"Its probably because my frienships tend to be emotionally intimate but I dont see the problem with having close friends in a relationship. To me an s/o is just one of your closest friends who you agree to move forward together on life decisions and are exclusively physically intimate with. It's hard for me to understand the concept of emotional affairs as a result. I love all my friends and sometimes even tell them ""i love you"", but its in a family way not a physical way. Its hard for me to put into words but love is a choice and an emotion, and the choice part is what makes it strongest. Its a choice i make to be exclusive with/committed to my s/o and no one can come up and unknowingly usurp that  because the two of us get emotionally close or even if theyre also like a supermodel or something. That would have to be a choice i make, and It's not who i want to be. Personally i dont really understand what your getting at with ""blissful"" meetings either. I have lots of meetings i go to and act happy and upbeat even though i feel like the meeting shouldnt exist and dont wanna be there because, well it's work... what are you gonna do? Might as well approach things positively. As for the hiding messages thing, it's a bit weird but could be coincidence also. I think you should have a discussion with your wife about how you are feeling in a non accusatory way. It's okay to be vulnerable and worry from time to time, but don't let these feelings build up. I know who i am and what i want out of life, and im not willing to make my frienships more shallow emotionally, even for my s/o. Still i understand this can come off as shady to people, so if my s/o expressed they were feeling this way I would explain my perspective and reassure them that they are the only one i love in this sense, and i would never do anything to hurt them. I still like privacy and i would feel a bit antagonized if i had to give up my passwords, so i dont think i could do that knowing ive done nothing wrong, but i would be okay with showing my partner the conversations they feel ive been hiding from them to ease their mind. 

Not sure if this feedback is helpful but the takeaway is this: its okay to worry and feel vulnerable. Even if this ends up being nothing its ok to feel how you do. A lot of people are calling you paranoid and i dont feel like anything is up either but to me that feels very invalidating toward your feelings. I think it's best to have a non aggressive, open ended convo about how you feel without making demands or accusations. Keep the focus on you and your emotions and see how she responds to that. I think most people would respond in a constructive way."

I would be really mad if my gf was trying to do that to me. I think you need to talk to her about how it's not okay and you will continue to have friendships on your own terms.

As a lesbian, I found it deeply offensive to suggest men's sexuality is set in stone while womens is universally fluid as you did in the last lecture; effectively suggesting lesbians can become attracted to men, and female homosexuality doesnt really exist. It reminds me of  conversion therapy rhetoric or the idea that lesbians just need to ""meet the right guy"", which is very upsetting to hear in an educational setting. Lesbians are not attracted to men by definition, and I disliked the insinuation that lesbians can become attracted to men, particularly in front of the rest of the class. The line of thinking presented in the lecture encourages others, particularly men, to doubt and harass lesbians, and is deeply invalidating and alienating on a personal level. Thank you for your time."" If she doesn't respond to this, or responds in a shitty way, congrats on the paper trail : ) feel free to push the issue with the higher ups at your university.

Of course this is just a template, i would probably be more specific about what she said in the lecture. Not sure how old you are? But you don't have to be afraid to stand up for yourself. Of course if anyone feels this is too blunt feel free to suggest changes or additions."

I just couldnt image a situation where i would be okay with sleeping with a man even if i had to agree with it to keep the relationship in tact. I started worrying when it came to that i wouldn't be able to dissociate well enough and would cry during it and i
I would get broken up with and it would all be for nothing so it was very stressful. At this point I started to work on myself and accepting that i was a lesbian slowly. This is when i let myself love women. Even though accepting it was difficult and lonely, i felt at peace. I can imagine a future where i am not miserable and it doesn't feel like i had something horrible looming. I dont feel scared or pathetic or inadequate anymore.

truelesbians,fki2dgw,t1_fkghbj6,1584210565.0,"I think it's okay to hang out with guys, you just have to be clear about it (literally say ""as friends"" lmao) and read the room. The problems start when you assume men dont need to have things spelled out for them imo 🙄"

BPD,fjvluub,t3_ferpg1,1583628496.0,"I'm often told im very innocent and have a childlike joy and wonder to my personality. I'm still able to do what i need to function as an adult though for the most part, so i don't think of it as a bad thing : )"
truelesbians,fjvk4e1,t1_fju69wq,1583628003.0,"I agree that this behavior is terrible and op didn't deserve this, but please stop amchair diagnosing and demonizing people with bpd. As it turns out not all of us are terrible, many are actively managing our own symptoms and working through our traumas in order to be better and live better lives, and not everyone that does something shitty has bpd. You are contributing to the massive amount of stigma we deal with by making these sorts of comments. Bpd != bad person and you may know people who are working through it but can't tell anyone because of this sentiment."
truelesbians,fjtzma8,t3_fey8zv,1583612246.0,"There's no cases in my state yet. I'm not worried as I'm salaried and fairly healthy. I'm not doing anything differently other than buying slightly more groceries than i usually would in case i get sick or theres an outbreak near me and i have to self quarantine/ work from home. My office is fairly travel focused and arent limiting domestic travel yet, so there's a moderate risk."
truelesbians,fjsjqen,t3_fewz5f,1583597767.0,"As you are attracted to both men and women, evn if you dont date men, you are bisexual but i understand why you don't want to label yourself that with the larger bisexual community being what it is. Febfem is a good option though. It stands for female exclusive bisexual female. To a lot of people you will have to tell them what it means but there are bi women who use it and lesbians usually know what it means too."
Actuallylesbian,fjmzfmk,t3_fe1389,1583491680.0,"Sleeping, video games, podcasts while cleaning (it feels weird to put this as a favorite activity but i feel so good when my house is spotless), youtube,and netflix."
GirlGamers,fjfj8qe,t1_fjfavd4,1583292916.0,Not sure if it's the exact same one but i have [this](https://www.target.com/p/full-queen-sherpa-bed-blanket-blush-peach-room-essentials-8482/-/A-54259616) one from target that's really close
truelesbians,fj8xsgj,t3_fbdwa1,1583125260.0,"I'm also hot and cold, and dealing with some past stuff. Am in therapy to manage the bpd i developed because of it. Hard to say if things are the same for her since idk if she has bpd. At least for me when i say i need space or start pushing people away it's because I'm having a hard time and don't want to drag anyone down or hurt anybody or I am scared at the level of intimacy (either it is too fast or I saw something that set me off (not necessarily something someone i know did, it can be something as small as a cheating subplot in a tv show and i start thinking about how often that happens irl and how badly i would be hurt and if it's worth it to stay close to people or i hear a guy does something terrible and i suddenly have a crippling fear of the guys in my life). I know i sound crazy but it is what it is. I'm working to manage it and if your gf is the same as me I'm sure she is too. I don't like it when people ask how I'm doing or try to interact with me in person when i need space. I appreciate when people send me texts or tell me they love me though. As a symptom of my disorder, I feel things very deeply, so things can get out of control easily. On the other hand I also understand the loneliness and loss/rejection you are feeling because i have had a hard time connecting when i wanted to and have felt that deeply also. There is no easy solution or advice but i wanted to give my perspective."
truelesbians,fj8vt19,t3_fbw3zq,1583123613.0,There's this bizarre earnestness here like he totally doesn't realize how creepy and dangerous this makes him come off. Men really do live in a different world than women...
truelesbians,fj8uyst,t3_fc4ktf,1583122942.0,"This is incredibly fucked up. I'm on the same page as you, imagine if the genders were switched...I know you said she has nowhere else to go but I think you're way too empathetic. If I were you I'd leave it to her to figure out. It's not your problem. If it were me she could sleep on the streets for all I care. If you do fucked up shit, deal with the consequences. I'd probably even go the extra mile, explain what i said and how i felt and insist my brother not contact her again unless he wants to damage our relationship."
truelesbians,fj5t04m,t3_fbouvv,1583042073.0,"I don't know, I am fairly straightforward and not excessively sexual or romantic i guess (i get more out of emotional intimacy but i need time to build it) so i feel like I can relate to how she is acting, especially when I'm getting used to someone. For me it takes time. I think it's okay to just ask how she feels, I always do that if i notice mixed messages and I'd never be mad if someone asked me. Life is a lot easier when you are direct and take each other at their word than each side trying to figure things out on their own."
truelesbians,fj1n74x,t3_f9vn6u,1582923571.0,I also do software. Not too crazy about some aspects of my current job and the pay is bad for the field so I'll be moving on in around a year. Probably to another company but more on the front end side.
truelesbians,fj1h2qy,t3_faxdw2,1582919917.0,"Pretty alright, not sure what the bad news is because I'm not really looking at it much. Other than some dudes at work saying stocks are bad. Mostly playing games and playing with my cat."
BPD,fhny0lw,t3_f3r9cf,1581735451.0,"I sleep as much as I possibly can when i am very depressed. I’ve been having a hard time this week, and I pretty much wake up, go to work, am tired all day at work, go home and sleep, wake up around 6 or 7 to eat some food, go back to sleep and repeat it the next day. I really hate it, I’m still tired no matter how much I sleep and I feel I’m wasting my life. But when I’m normal/anxious I have a very hard time sleeping so maybe it balances out."
truelesbians,fhkfoxc,t3_f3dji6,1581681863.0,"Building trust, being patient and building emotional intimacy before you become physically intimate."

truelesbians,fh7hepk,t1_fh74ete,1581331988.0,There’s always anomalies but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a very bad idea.
truelesbians,fh6ymve,t3_f0x86b,1581309502.0,Anything less than a year is a very bad idea. You should sign a 12 month lease and wait.

truelesbians,fgs9879,t3_f03mbn,1581077203.0,"I feel like it’s pretty obvious she was disgusted by the sexualization. I’d be uncomfortable too... personally I find it pervy, especially since you’re broing out with two straight guys. Be more professional at work."
truelesbians,fgo3b94,t3_eyzmc0,1580958792.0,"Thin or athletic body type, femme or femme leaning, dark hair and dark eyes. I also prefer people with sharp facial features rather than soft and rounded."

truelesbians,fgnvky7,t1_fgnr17v,1580953849.0,"Yeah, i think it’s a generational thing. Personally I feel like there’s nothing insidious about it. Its just easier to say and less serious sounding. 🤷‍♀️"
