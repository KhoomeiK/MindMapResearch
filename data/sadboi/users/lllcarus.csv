I think this is what I was expecting from recovery, to eventually feel happier, or at least not feel the pain anymore. I make some bad feelings resurface while in recovery, and I do catch myself repressing and trying to diminish these negative emotions. This struggle of course activates the inner critic, starting a downward spiral that takes a while to get out of.

CPTSD,er7qq79,t1_er4wh9h,1560584683.0,"It takes courage to allow yourself to feel the pain, to fight it instead of denying it. At least I think so.

It’s not easy to be criticized, to question our own assumptions, to accept that you’re wrong. Some people are just not willing to feel the discomfort.

I believe that to be able and willing to have the humility to question yourself, to consider that you may be wrong when someone says so, even when it hurts, is very noble. To be willing to assume blame is not easy, and sadly the people who are often forget that.

That being said, abusers will most definitely use it against you, so it’s wise to step back and assess from time to time if you’re attributing too much blame to yourself. It can be very destructive to your self image to attribute unwarranted blame. I believe it creates some nasty Cptsd, and it just feels unfair.

Allowing ourselves to feel the pain can help us get into most needed rock bottoms. Despair and hurt are the first step to recovery, and being brave enough to feel the pain and not deflect it can help make us see things clearly.

The point he makes about connecting the dots looking backwards, and not forward, as to why you should trust and follow your heart can be very inspiring. Also the one he makes about death. He argues that all external expectations, pride, fears of embarrassment and failure fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. 

> “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoiding the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked, there’s no reason not to follow your heart.”

It’s a grim perspective, thinking about it can trigger some existential depression, so I wonder if using it can damage more than help people with ptsd. It does tend to lift social constraints quite a bit, so even while having downsides it can be quite effective.

> “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown down your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

Maybe our social circle doesn’t necessarily have to be made up of people so similar to us. I don’t know if this is an issue for you, but I’ve spent a long time filtering and pushing people away.

Of course there may be trauma related elements to my isolation as well.

LifeAfterNarcissism,eojf2cg,t3_bs16z2,1558637022.0,"I did too at first. 

When we’re in contact with the narcissist we expect to bond. We want to feel understood, or at least feel seen and have our dignity acknowledged as a person. Some abusers can’t even do that.

Not having your bonding expectations crushed every time can be a relief when we limit contact. It’s kinda like going from negative to zero. After some time I started to feel lonely again, but it was different. It wasn’t a sorrow or hurt coming from the neglect, but instead a will to meet and be surrounded by good people. Kinda like going from zero to positive.

Don’t get discouraged if you start to feel lonely again. Be careful not to be drawn to the relationship with the abuser if you feel like connecting with someone. Some narcissists count on your isolation, and having them as your only source of social interaction to be able to use you.
