unpopularopinion,fqk02po,t3_gjbycg,1589417850.0,I'm black and I won't throw those reasons at you. I feel like what you said about her is very valid. Even I see through it. You can tell she's not really happy with who she is. I'm proud of her too but I think ppl need to chill. Ppl should be allowed to say how they feel without being demonized about their opinion. I don't like Lizzo because she does seem disingenuous and her music isn't rap to me. It's okay for you to not like her.

relationship_advice,fqccgsr,t3_gi3ay4,1589254888.0,Maybe you can encourage her to go to therapy. I used to be like her chances are there could be some trauma in her past. Make sure you are supportive and try to understand she problems doesn't even want to be that clingy. I know I didn't but the pain I was dealing with made me that way with my boyfriend. It really helped when he listened to me and validated what I was going through.

intermittentfasting,for55hc,t3_g8prcs,1588006348.0,"Hello I'm a female 24 and I went from 8 weeks of 16:8 started on February 17 to OMAD last Sunday the 19th of April. My goal weight is 120 and I started fasting due to lowering my cholesterol and obtaining self discipline. I am fasting from sugar and carbs mainly. My current hours are 21:3 and surprisingly it's not as hard because I started doing the 16:8. 

I also got into fasting because when I was in college I gained like 50 pounds and I'm only 5 feet so it made me obese for my height. I struggled with depression and anxiety and I feel like with my new eating habits i am doing better with my mental health issues. 

I used to be very slow and sluggish and sleep all day but ever since I began fasting and eating healthy portioned meals I have energy, I'm happier and I am not lazy anymore. My self confidence has improved. I feel closer to God (I also fast due to my faith).  I guess in total I have been fasting for about 10/11 weeks. 

I would love to get down to 120 and then fast to maintain my weight. Fasting has also helped me with my Binge Eating Disorder and emotional eating. I am more mindful of what I put into my body. I am very happy about where I am spiritually mentally and physically.

I try to eat at least 1000-1200 calories a day. My concern is that sometimes it doesn't seem to be very filling but I know you are supposed to feel a little hunger to lose weight so Idk...

Are you guys taking vitamins?

What workouts do you guys recommend? 

Should I find a buddy? 

Will I lose my period?"

I also know that some people are trolls on here because they don't know my personal life situation or how my family is. It is hard living with a triggering family because at one point they're praising me for losing weight, then they are competing now with me, and then they are trying to sabotage me it's a cycle. I only have like two more weeks for this quarantine anyways."

I felt like I was going crazy but I have been in therapy so I know my mom is codependent and a covert narcissist! Please don't make yourself throw up though. Like my mom will literally gaslight me in a very sneaky covert fashion. Where she will say it's your fault you're eating all this unhealthy food  (but when I vocalize that I am trying to create a healthier lifestyle for myself she gets mad and CONSTANTLY offers it. I do say no though and I don't eat it).  Or like she constantly tells me she's jealous of how thin I have become and it makes me terribly uncomfortable because she really is! 

I just can't wait until this quarantine is over. I am tired of my family! I kind of want to go home soon. I may be will leave after this week."

selfimprovement,fn9y5ib,t1_fn99fuf,1586787229.0,"This is very encouraging and uplifting. I do struggle with codependency so it could be I'm taking responsibility for my parents mistakes and then forgiving them as a result but not forgiving myself. I have already met with my vocal coach now I really need to just keep working to get the funds to pay her. I have considered adapting my dreams and also I know I don't want fame more so I just want to do what I love and be an independent artist.

selfimprovement,fn95ddu,t1_fn94sfz,1586759985.0,"This has helped me feel better. Looking at your passions as a hobby isn't a bad start. I wld like to start to look at it in that angle so there's no pressure in making a career. I have been vocally trained but I was never serious due to insecurities and not liking competition I hate competition but I realize now in the arts you're going to have to deal with some. Also like you mental health issues and finances got in the way for my family. I wld go to voice lessons for like a month then my parents cldnt afford it anyways. Then I did sing/self train and I did okay, I joined choirs that was like  free low cost vocal training, but then my current churches shoot director left and so there is no leadership or professional vocal training being done. I have done so much on my own so singing isn't new to me I've been performing since 9 but I need more polishing and training imo."

WeightLossAdvice,fkwfxh7,t1_fkwfwg3,1584591374.0,You're welcome you can do this!
WeightLossAdvice,fkwfjzc,t3_fl3gzs,1584591072.0,"Let me give you some motivation and insight. I used to be in your shoes. That was because I didn't realize fasting and exercising is about discipline and commitment. It is about a goal weight and looking nicer but you know why working hard to lose weight on your own is better than getting cosmetic lipo? Because it teaches you valuable principles my grandmother taught me this. I read this book called Self Compassion I forgot the author but it's really good. It teaches you have to be easy on yourself. As humans we think beating ourselves up will make things more efficient it won't dear. Have self compassion for yourself. Having self compassion actually is better than negative self talk because when you're kinder to yourself you are more motivated and happier. Start with that! Tell yourself ""maybe I didn't workout today or stick to my fasting hours but that's okay I can try again tomorrow."" 

What that does is build up: 1. self compassion and then you feel better. 2. Commitment because yea you may have initially started March 1st but fell off but if you keep going regardless of the days you didn't fast or workout that shows dedication and commitment because you still came back. It may take you longer to get to your goal but at least you'll still make it. If you quit all together then you will really be feeling bad bc then you wld have just given up. 

Think of it this way: Failure is your ally because it shows you where you need to improve. For example, you may feel triggered to eat hot chips that are loaded with carbs (this used to be me) and so you feel like a failure. Allow yourself to eat the last of those chips and then either make healthier alternatives or don't get them at the grocery store. 

Sorry I wrote so much but I hope this helps. Don't give up! 

Oh shoot! One more thing stress eating! I used to be a HUGE stress eater. I found out I was that way because I was using food as a comforter. Eating was my coping skill. Until one day I left my toxic family and situation and I decided I'm going to eat for fuel and not for comfort. Foods sole purpose is to refuel us not be our bestie lol. Definitely have a cheat meal every once in a while but don't be like the old me: when you are crying and alone you order a large pizza haha. Read, journal, paint etc come up with a list of things you can do instead of eat when stressed. Or make a healthy meal when stressed. Don't give up seriously you got this."
dating_advice,fkwepcz,t3_fl3hay,1584590411.0,I'm a female and I honestly think that it's ignorant to think that in today's society where plastic surgery is so normal. I do believe ppl can get too much work done which can backfire on what they are trying to achieve. I feel like if you get minor tweaks that made you get a boost in your confidence then you don't have to tell anyone and if you do and they feel like you're easy or fake then they don't deserve you. It's just become the norm imo now. Ppl are doing a lot of tweaking because it's the norm to have your photo being everywhere or being filmed so when you're on camera all the time it's inevitable for you to change SOMETHING lol.
