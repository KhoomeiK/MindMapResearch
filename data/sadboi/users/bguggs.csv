It could possibly be worse in the long run too. This all boils down to the same political and economic arguments that the world has been fighting over for the past century—is it better for more people for the government or private corporations to own the means of production. And there are strong arguments on both sides. 

The public sector ostensibly has public good as the primary motive rather than profit (or exponential growth as you say). On the surface that’s better, but the counter argument is that the lack of need for growth can stifle innovation and improvement and gives “consumers” a backseat to “voters”."

Not out of the goodness of their hearts but as a strategy. Their theory of the case is to grow by increasing scale to lower price. Lower prices —> more buyers —> more efficient supply chain —> lower prices —> repeat.

You can see it all over the history of the business. So while it’s theoretically possible they’d bump prices in the case of a monopoly you’re far more likely to see them try to grow the market or enter an adjacent one to continue to increase scale. 

I’m not saying increased competition is bad, just pointing out that price gouging by Amazon is highly unlikely."

We launched two policies on the old site (A New Era for Service and the Douglass Plan) but it really wasn't built to be the content management system it needed to be. The policy team was ready for policy blitzkrieg and started rolling out plans every week. Doing that on the original system would have been impractical. So the initial impetus was needing to be on infrastructure that allowed us to build out templated pages fast. 

It also allowed us to have a lot more flexibility in the types of pages that we could create, the way we could experiment with different elements (sign up forms, etc.), and the way we could scale as we dealt with the traffic of a full Presidential campaign.

Moderate or progressive. You can see that in the hundreds of bills they’ve passed together in the house.

I think the assumption that progress on these issues is about which President fights the hardest once in office incorrect.

When it fails, it’s largely because people find ways to cheat the system and not work with other people. That’s the real problem with money in politics and gerrymandering and disenfranchisement. What happened this weekend was democracy at its best. 

But now comes the hardest part, because Bernie (and Warren) represents a large bloc that is angry and wants change. We need them to be part of the team too.

He thinks that Americans from different backgrounds working together on something hard is exactly the kind of broadening experience that helps to knit our country together but that you SHOULDN’T have to go to war to do it.

Because college is not for everybody.

Now I want everybody who wants to go to college to have the chance. I want to make sure cost isn’t a barrier. But where I come from three out of four people don’t have a college degree, and if the message we’re sending them is that you need a college degree to get by in life, in order to prosper, in order to succeed, we’re leaving most Americans out.

The whole thing is fantastic but he goes into not jumping down people’s throats and realizing that each of us can be good or evil."
customhearthstone,f5pfkwi,t1_f5p99cm,1572358139.0,"Yes but this also only casts much when your opponent has a full board. I’d think Yogg is better in situations where your opponent is playing control or attrition. Obviously both are bad when you’re ahead but there are ways to be behind that aren’t board state, especially if your opponent knows you might have this card."
politics,f5bjzvm,t1_f59q52x,1572122492.0,Yes and it's only responsible to show the math. It's pretty clear now that the right was never serious about fiscal responsibility because they've ignored deficits as soon as they got into office. If the left also ignores financing our proposals...nobody is doing it.

outside,f2aje12,t1_f29zxva,1570114065.0,"100% agreed. For this playthrough I did a side-quest for an extra level and some resource collection between the high school mini game and four-year college mission and I can tell you it was a power play. My character was able to actually afford food vendors which was nice, but also it had the experience level to see all of the possible quests and complete the ones that actually mattered. Having a level up on the competition didn’t hurt either.

A lot of people jump straight into the college mission as soon as it is unlocked, but a bit of extra grinding has compounding dividends that will continue to pay off throughout the entire game."

There will be more resources around this in the near future but also it would be great if you could document your experience so that other people can learn from it!"

Pete_Buttigieg,f0s35sv,t1_f0rr06w,1568898022.0,"I think that’s right (discounting National Service which was published before Pete started doing footnotes).

Rural health care clocks in at 54 and 10. Although if you consider the health care plans together as part of a series the numbers change a bit. By the time Pete’s done we could be looking at something like 100 pages all-in.

politics,eyyub95,t1_eyxq3i5,1567602009.0,"This hasn't gotten much play yet in this subreddit, but Buttigieg released his plan this morning. New Paris Climate goal for 2030, net-zero industry emissions by 2050. It does not just talk about America's clean economy though. That's the baseline. It also prioritizes investing in our own resilience knowing that there will be (and already are) climate effects. It aims to position America as a climate leader on the world stage because we cannot solve this alone.

politics,exbthtz,t1_ewv0cxp,1566137770.0,I get why you’d think that. It’s abnormal for a politician to say high-level things that make sense and actually back it up with substance. But here’s how it’ll work: https://peteforamerica.com/rural-america
politics,exbtaqu,t1_ewv43s7,1566137676.0,A big part of Pete’s recovery of South Bend (a dying factory city) was focusing on its quality of place rather than just trying to figure out tax incentives to pull in business like most of his predecessors. Part of investing in the rust belt and rural America is making it somewhere those engineers and other folks WOULD want to live. And all this stuff: https://peteforamerica.com/rural-america
Pete_Buttigieg,ewytwis,t1_ewulolj,1565886724.0,"Aren't those related problems? The service workers have to be where the people they serve are. If there are incentives for folks who can work remotely to move to rural America, there is no reason that the more service-oriented industries can't follow. There are some real efficiencies to cities, but our big cities are buckling and having smaller urban centers across America could do some real good."
