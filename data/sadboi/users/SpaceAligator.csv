If you dont wear it, some guys will straight up ignore you while others think you look ""nerdy"" and worth of attention. If you wear it, some will think youre too girly and cant handle the job, while others will pay more attention to what you have to say.

I ve seen very different reactions to both wearing and to wearing make up. Make up is not the issue, but how people often attribute your value based on appearace."

I never noticed back then that i didnt match those things she said about me, only when i moved to live alone across the country I realized i was actually nothing of what she told me.

AskWomen,eph9928,t1_epgoy1d,1559223882.0,"My jawline used to be like that too. It was because as a child I had a lot of allergies, so i had to breath through my mouth, and over time the position of your jaw muscles make it so your jaw doesnt develop properly. Fortunately my parents are doctors and around the age of 9 they took me to an orthodontist and I used braces until I was 15. Now my chin looks pretty normal and the problem was reverted. 

Ok this whole story was to tell you: maybe you also have this problem and depending on your age (if your not 20 yet) you could still check with a doctor about fixing it. It obviously could just be that you re comparing yourself to those photoshoped girls that wear a lot of make up to shape their faces, if thats the case dont worry, there are sorts of shapes out there and yours is probably pretty too =)"

AskMen,ep26r9x,t1_ep1xfu7,1559003027.0,Woman here. Basically only had male friends until I was 16. I think it's one of the reasons (surely not the only one) that I am a very competitive person. Couple that with a low self esteem and oh boy life has been a roller coaster. I get what you mean with the unsaid and subtle competition.
AskReddit,eosz95r,t1_eoswjql,1558832178.0,"Sure, dont worry you re not being rude! So, Im usually a very conflict averse person, so I would always agree with agree or say anything as long as everybody was happy (sometimes I wouldnt be, but who cares?). My boyfriend is the complete opposite, he says and do anything he wants no matter the consequences.

When we began dating it was hard because he would get me in difficult situations or hurt me with his words, and I oftenly pointed out how his personality was difficult dealing with, while he would say mine was difficult to work with as he would never know what I really wanted or what was going on inside my head. 

These arguments were really hard for me at first, because of my idealistic view of romantical relationships I mentioned before and because of things he said that sounded mean to me. But as time went by, I started noticing somethings and being more selfaware of things he told me about, especially in respect of my family (how they constantly hurt me and Id still die for them thinking they were flawless) and in my career (how I always compared myself to others and kept thinking I wasnt worth it). And I noticed how these things were hurting me and hurting him because he couldnt bear seeing me putting myself in these tough situarions that obviously drained me emotionally.

I started to take small steps in changing my reaction to conflict, trying not to run away every time, and its hard, but he helps me (and a practice a lot in him too, so we get into some heated arguments sometimes). I really dont believe hes way of dealing with conflict is healthy at all, as i ve already pointed out to him, and we can see that we balance each other well and he really thinks about and takes in my opions on this sort of thing (he thinks Im more mature than him but really, we re both just trying to sort out our own problems while trying to make each other happy), and I can see he has changed a lot since we began dating (his long time friends also say that his a better person with me). 

So this is an example, sorry for the long answer or if it got too personal, but I agree with you that its a very very very gray area this people-changing-for-each-other thing. It helps that I see a therapist and have close friends and a beloved sister taht are always ready to listen to me bitching and help me sort things out."
AskReddit,eoqsulj,t1_eoqfa3d,1558796402.0,"I know exactely what you mean (the first part anyway hehe). I used to think that if someone loved me romantically he would accept me the way i am and wouldnt want to change anything in me. 

But then I met my boyfriend, and oh boy its been fun, but its also been challenging. He has a very different personality from mine, and he has challenged me to improve mayself and not settle.

He would watch some aspects of my personality making my life more difficult, or hurting myself because of this things, and he couldnt bear seeing me suffer because of things only i could change. So he straight out just tells me this things constantely so I can better myself for myself, and be happier. 

Im sttuborn, so its been a long process (4 years), but theres no one id rather have by my side in thus process. Hes the one."
