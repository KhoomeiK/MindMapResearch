If the topics that come up when you experience brain lock during conversations recur, then I’d suggest a few things. Create some material ahead of time. You’re good enough at writing to do this. It can be as simple as different forms of agreement and ways of confirming that she’s being heard. Repeating what someone says in your own words often works well. 

A more advanced tactic would be rerouting “a brain lock topic” to more comfortable ground. Again, it’ll help if there are recurring topics that lead to brain lock. Break those topics into their parts. Find something to agree with when it comes to each part. People often mistake agreement for understanding because they’re adjacent to one another.

Autistic,ev2zc0f,t3_ciagvg,1564186392.0,"Hey, just so you know 1) benzodiazepines, the class of medications that lorazepam belongs to, interfere with the formation of emotional memories and 2) psychiatric health providers have gotten VERY stingy about prescribing benzos. The potential for addiction is really high and coming off them can be challenging. 

I thought I'd respond because even psych nurses I've spoken with are unfamiliar with the emotional memory aspect. That and I experienced having to go off benzos by myself due to a change in doctors. I hope you don't mind all this extra info."
