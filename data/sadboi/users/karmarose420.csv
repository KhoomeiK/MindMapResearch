The hardest thing for me in my sobriety has been having to feel everything I kept numb for so long. I still don't understand how people just have feelings and not feel completely overwhelmed. It's okay to feel this way. Just don't let it overpower you. Maybe instead of a gratitude list you could make a list of the things you are working for. The things you can only accomplish if you stay sober. For me I think about what would happen to my son if I were to relapse and it puts things into perspective for me.

He finally said he loves me and it meant so much to me because I actually know he means it. It did feel ""boring"" at first but now it feels secure. Since quarantine I've been having thoughts like hes cheating on me, but I talked to him about it and explained that it's not that I don't trust him it's just because of my past relationships. I was shocked when he didn't get mad. He said he had no reason to be mad but hes not cheating on me and he hopes I can feel better soon. Its definitely worth getting through the time it takes to get comfortable."
FinancialPlanning,fpga8p4,t1_fpfspyz,1588598338.0,Thanks so much. I had 2k saved but now it's gone because of my stupid car and I'm back to just a few hundred so I'll wait to invest. I think my car is going to die any time now or at least need more work. My brakes are screeching and I need new tires. Not sure why my check engine light is on. My main reason for wanting to invest is that my four front teeth have been destroyed from eating disorders and drug use. I'm not doing those things anymore but if I lose my teeth I will look like I did. I just want to afford to have teeth in my face and my state funded insurance doesn't cover it. I've also heard that most dental programs through jobs dont cover implants either. But if I can't save money for that by the time i need them partial dentures are much cheaper.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fpf8bkc,t3_gd1798,1588564231.0,I take my son for hikes. He really enjoys it and seeing him happy is the most fun thing for me. Also play wrestling and being a horse
NarcoticsAnonymous,fpeqkq7,t1_fpembk8,1588552833.0,It went pretty well. Got to see an old friend and hear some people talk about what they're doing to stay sober and how quarantine is affecting them. Nobody pressured me about finding a higher power or even made me talk in front of the group. Everyone was super nice to my son. I'm going back next week
fatlogic,fpe9j5i,t1_fpdx9ss,1588543071.0,Oh I'm on mobile. Darn it
NarcoticsAnonymous,fpdyizp,t1_fpdxbqq,1588536791.0,That's like saying a depressed person doesn't know what would help support them. I definitely know what kind of support I need and being able to communicate that to my significant other and the few friends I have has had an amazing impact on my recovery.
