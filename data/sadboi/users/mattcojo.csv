unpopularopinion,fr5gnn1,t1_fr5cyob,1589908254.0,"> The first things on the source is that they made a mistake in counting the cases. There was an error that led to a dip in cases. Apparently by “accident” so the graph isn’t correct.

So what you’re saying is that there’s some sort of conspiracy that says there’s lower cases of states that have reopened, even though there aren’t? Because if you’re saying that it wasn’t an “accident” then that’s what you’re saying. Data, as you’ve stuck to your guns about, has shown a gradual trend downward. 

> I’m not saying there is a certain number that one has to hit but 700 cases one day and 300 hundred one day and then back to 600 isn’t trending downward. Trending downward is 500, 400, 300, 200...So there has been no trend down.

Let me explain this to you. In statistics, you see an overall rate for a certain probability. When you flip a coin, you have a 50/50 shot for either heads or tails. If you conducted 100 trials at a given time, you’d expect 50 heads, and 50 tails. Turns out you’re probably not going to get that. You may get 49/51 for example. 50/50 doesn’t mean for every heads, you’ll get a tails. It means that if we conduct many, many trials, we would expect the rate of heads and tails to eventually level out and be 50/50.

How does this relate to this? Well because it applies to here as well. In Georgia, even if cases rise and fall a little by day, you’re seeing a general decrease in the number of cases as well as overall positive test rates. Even if you get 300 one day, and 600 another, that doesn’t mean the overall decreasing trend isn’t happening because one or two days weren’t a decrease. Just because you flip a coin 100 times, and get 48 heads and 52 tails doesn’t mean the rate of heads to tails isn’t 50/50. 

> Me giving information on the lack of trend isn’t me moving the goalposts, you saying people should wear masks then recanting and saying maybe we need to look at masks since GA doesn’t wear them is you moving the goals posts.

You gave two days worth of cases as your “proof” that a decreasing trend didn’t exist. Which is certainly moving the goal posts. And I just made a comment about masks. When you said you live in Georgia, you went to a Walmart, and no one else was wearing masks, I just said “maybe masks aren’t effective given the trends.” There’s no proof in it, I’m just making a comment. There’s no goalpost moving or anything there.

> There is nothing to believe or not to believe, look at what is happening. I want business to open, I’m sick of being in the house but I also want it to be safe to do so. Right now isn’t safe. Especially when people refuse to wear masks and we can’t be contact traced.

Here’s the proof that says you’re incorrect. Look at the numbers. They’ve been trending downward for a few weeks now. There isn’t any proof saying they’re trending upward.

> Okay well since 2 days isn’t a trend. They haven’t had 1 day less than 300 cases since March 30th...how is that trending downward?? It’s been up and down for months.

So trending downward means it has to reach a certain 300 or below mark? 

> What did goalpost did I move lol?? I legit asked how do you expect people to wear masks anywhere else if they won’t do it in Walmart and you said “well cases in GA are trending down” which 1 isn’t true and 2 as if that means the virus is gone and people shouldn’t still wear masks.

You moved the goalposts by giving two days of cases as your proof for why cases haven’t been trending downward. Even though 2 days isn’t a trend. You also do realize that May 17th is a Sunday, and May 18th is a Monday. Even in times like these where we can forget the days, we still understand that you’re probably going to see more cases on a Monday than a Sunday.

I also never said the virus was gone. People in the south just don’t believe some of the things that people in the north wearing masks do. And given Georgia has been trending downward for a while now, we should be taking a look at masks. There’s a lack of masks, but Georgia’s cases continue to drop.

Redskins,fr3tu96,t1_fr3odzy,1589866101.0,"> I'm considering the 'high-water mark' for both QBs.  You're hoping Haskins will have a game like Jones already had.  4+ TDs, no Interceptions 3 times a season is pretty good.  Multiple games with 300+ yards passing.

That would be nice, but I don’t care for that. I want a QB who is smart with the ball and takes field goals instead of interceptions. I want a winner, not a showboat.

You’re just ignoring that fact that those games aren’t exactly common games. Daniel Jones is literally Eli Manning but a tad more mobile. Eli had those games every now and often, but would I call him better than Phillip Rivers or Ben Roethlisberger? No, no I wouldn’t. 

> 10/10 I want to have a rookie play aggressively and commit more turnovers than have someone who plays super conservatively and commits very few.

And it’s not as if Haskins was being super conservative. In fact, if you paid attention, it was jones being the one making the more conservative reads. He had far more simple slant and screen passes than Haskins did in that offense. The offense was catered to his strengths in a way the offense for Haskins wasn’t. Pay attention to the preseason for example as proof: he had better numbers in the one drive in the first game he played. But actually look at the throws he made.

> If Haskins and Jones both get better by the same amount, Jones is still the better QB.  Haskins would have to have nothing short of a magnificent improvement to catch Jones.

And here’s your bias once again. I’m not going to discount Daniel Jones. He had a solid rookie season. But the results he had is really the production you’d expect him to do every year. He’s not going to be a player you get those common 4 TD games with. He’s a game manager in the same way Eli was. Which isn’t a bad thing of course, but it just means that what we saw of him this year isn’t going to go any further. The Giant’s offense is Barkley first, Jones 2nd. I don’t expect Jones to get over 30 Touchdowns in a season consistently. He’s not going to be someone to improve past Eli’s position. Nothing against him, that’s just his talent and capability.

Haskins on the other hand has that potential to be a smart QB who doesn’t get as many touchdowns as some other guys and doesn’t put up gaudy numbers, but will be someone who is smart with his reads and accurate with his throws. He’s got the potential to be a great talent in this league. Again, I don’t care if he gets below 30 touchdowns in a season if he only throws 7 INTs all year. Numbers mean a lot but not as much as you think. Yards and touchdowns are nice but you know what’s nicer? Wins. And a QB that is smart with the ball will win games. This is why Jameis Winston wasn’t quarterbacking the 13-3 Bucs last season: he had great Stats in yardage and touchdowns, but too many turnovers cost the Bucs at least 5-6 games.

One of the key things you need to do to win games is to not turn over the ball. We lost a lot of games earlier in the season because we turned over the ball too much. If we limit our turnovers to a minimum, that’s probably 2-3 more wins already without even having to improve a single guy on the roster. Haskins in his starts proved he was very capable of doing that. And it showed later in the year when we won a couple of games in Charlotte and against Detroit, and nearly winning games against Green Bay, Philadelphia, and New York."
Redskins,fr3m13a,t1_fr2dym9,1589860397.0,Anyone who thinks Haskins is a bust at this point is also pretty delusional as well.
Redskins,fr3lqcl,t1_fr3jk11,1589860197.0,"> Jones has more turn overs because they trusted him to run an actual offense.  Are all 6 of those turnovers on Jones?  IDK, probably some are, some aren't.  I know he was blind side hit by a completely free defender on a number of occasions, but we don't make excuses for him, just Haskins.

Alright. If you want to just claim the excuse “oh he must’ve not been the fault for some of them”, let me remind you that in the last 4 games Haskins started, he had 2 turnovers. 1 was an interception, the other was a fumble, his only fumble. 

Now, let me throw out some facts for you. The interception was against Green Bay: the pocket broke down and he was hit as he threw on a pass to Kelvin Harmon. The other turnover was against the Eagles on the Hail Mary attempt at the end of the game where the eagles blitzed the pocket on weakened protection: a total fluke.

Daniel Jones had 4 INT’s and 6 fumbles, 2 of which he lost. In only 12 starts in his career, Daniel Jones had 18 fumbles, leading the league. This can’t all be blamed on an offensive line: there’s at least some fault that can be blamed on his pocket awareness, an issue Haskins hasn’t had.

> We'll see if Jones gets the interception monkey off his back (frankly, if he cleaned up just the fumbles he'd be okay), and that's something good young QBs do in their second year.

Fumble*

> When Haskins puts up a single 4 TD game against a non NFCE team, LMK.

Why does it matter how many touchdowns he throws in a game? What matters is that he can throw the ball effectively down the field and not turn the ball over. That’s what matters most in a suppressed offense where weapons are limited for the time being and protection isn’t fantastic. It’s like joaning on Julio Jones for not getting touchdowns: so what?

> 7 TD across 7 starts doesn't really inspire much confidence.  Okay, he was still learning, let's look at his last 4 starts.  5 TDs.  Daniel Jones?  9 TDs.

Situations need to be viewed. You also need to take into account that 5 of Jones’s touchdowns came in only one game. Which was against us.  In his last 4 games, Haskins had 1 interceptions and 1 fumble (you probably remember that one). Jones has 4 INT’s and 5 fumbles in this same time frame, two of which he lost. What’s better? 6 turnovers? Or 2? 

It’s no good for your team if you keep turning the ball over. Which he did, and Haskins didn’t over his last 4 starts.

I don’t exactly see too many minorities try and enter sports at the coaching level in comparison. It’s the same reason for why you see more white quarterbacks I guess: not because of racism, but probably because the players feel better suited at those positions."

It’s not about the factors, it’s just about people being over dramatic."
unpopularopinion,fqzxqs9,t1_fqzwb2g,1589778075.0,"Well, sorta. When I talk about a franchise, I mean a team entity. The franchise is basically the group that controls the physical team. 

I think we mostly agree, but the point I’m trying to make is the fact that if standards are being knowingly put in, such as potentially in the NFL, there’s no way of knowing if someone who was black, or Hispanic was hired for a diversity reason. It’s not only insulting to the fanbase because it can be interpreted as pandering to an audience that doesn’t need it, but also to the hire himself. If the team isn’t that good, and he’s kept around, he has no way of knowing if he was actually hired for his credentials, or because he was a minority. 

And it’s not as if people are getting passed on because of their race. There have been plenty of minority hires in the NFL in the very recent past. At one point, I believe there were 7 black head coaches at one time, with one Hispanic coach in the league 2 years ago. Just turned out however that 5 of them were fired during or after the season because they just weren’t producing results. It’s only virtue signaling liberal publications who think it was a racial issue.

People are also pointing out an offensive coordinator for the team who won the Super Bowl last season, the Kansas City Chiefs. This offensive coordinator (basically the 2nd in command on the team), who happens to be black, wasn’t hired as a head coach in last years hirings and firings that happen after the regular season ends, and there was a controversy surrounding it. What isn’t taken into account though that while this coach runs a great offense, he also has one of the league’s best, if not the best player currently football being Patrick Mahomes, and a great roster of talent on the offense. 

Even with the success the chiefs have had with him at that position, he’s only had 2 years at that position he’s currently in, and there’s the questions of both experience, as well as how much the results are because of the players and how much is from him. We have seen some hires in the league that have been guys who are woefully under qualified for a position be hired and burn out quickly, so I don’t feel like it’s an issue of opportunity here."

The NFL is contemplating on giving franchises with minority hires in GM and head coaching positions higher draft picks in some of the lower rounds. 

If someone was hired, and they happened to be black, or Hispanic after this was put into effect, how would that person know what they were hired for? Were they hired because the franchise actually believed in them? Or was it because they wanted a better player(s) and to show they were woke?"
