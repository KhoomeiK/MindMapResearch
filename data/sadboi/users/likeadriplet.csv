CPTSD,fljvklg,t1_fljqh5t,1585227759.0,"I’ve seen that come up as a search result before but I don’t think it applies to me. If I had a stroke as often as it happens, I would not be okay now. Plus I think strokes show up in MRIs... not sure though. I’ve had two MRIs and one as recent as last summer. Nothing in there luckily. It’s so weird though. 🤔"
sex,flbufbq,t3_fnw1v8,1585012850.0,"No reason to be embarrassed here, friend. 😊 I could never quite get there by myself. I cum a lot with a partner though! (And I was 29 my first time... could never trust anyone to let them in, for lack of a better phrase lol)

It’s something you definitely know when it happens."
ptsd,fk11uxk,t1_fk10zeu,1583770761.0,"Aw man that’s rough. It’s hard with autoimmune diseases because you can test normal and still have them. I had other symptoms when I was in college that I didn’t have when I was diagnosed. My numbers were normal then, but my doc said it’s possible that I still had it anyway even then. I really empathize. I can’t even remember how many medical tests I had when I was in college. That was connected to something else though (misdiagnosed with something and was on medicine that made me psychotic). I remember how frustrated I was with the whole medical practice. No one knew what was wrong with me and it seemed like no one cared to connect the dots. They all just thought I was crazy, which - I mean - yeah I was, and that was the problem. It was medically induced. 😑 I really wish you the best of luck. Maybe try cutting sodium if that’s relevant to your current diet at all. I switched to Himalayan salt and use less of it. The paleo diet has been really good for me. Even my head feels clearer."
ptsd,fk0u1at,t1_fk0rv38,1583766140.0,"I did! There are so many possible symptoms because the thyroid is connected to everything. When I went to the doc, it was because I started having issues breathing just resting. My resting heart rate was 140 BPM. The extra thyroid hormones were making my heart work like I was constantly running. That caused muscle tension because my body really thought I was working out all the time. It was wild. You can imagine how that constant physical stress would affect the mind. 

Now I’m on thyroid meds (they did cause some weight gain at first but it leveled out and I was able to lose it once I could exercise again), and I’ve been able to reduce the dosage by switching to a diet with no dairy, no processed foods, and only occasional meat. I feel so much better."
ptsd,fk0qgig,t3_ffsfm2,1583763815.0,"That actually ended up being a symptom of hyperthyroidism for me, which also involves heightened anxiety as a symptom (making everything worse). I’d recommend a doc for sure. I’ve felt much better since sorting the physical medical stuff out. Easier to manage the mental. Good luck to you. ❤️

Edited to add: I also noticed that the pulse was worse after high sodium foods, which was also connected to the thyroid issue. I tried eating ramen one evening and seriously almost went to the ER. I probably should have because they’d have diagnosed my hyperthyroidism 2 months earlier than when I finally went. My hyperthyroidism is due to Graves’ disease which is an autoimmune condition."
birthcontrol,ffrfgds,t1_ffrf22b,1580157023.0,Thanks! Pharmacy didn’t include it and I have to go back for it.
ptsd,ffqcuy9,t1_ffq4ewq,1580130656.0,You can check with your insurance to see if they cover it! My insurance has a $20 copay per session. Copays vary by provider. Good luck. ❤️❤️
ptsd,ffpyl9l,t3_eukcxs,1580111110.0,It might be worth it to look into seeing a different kind of therapist from the kind you’ve always seen. I see a dance movement therapist. It’s about connecting body to mind so we don’t always dance but we do yoga or breath work. We just let my body be free to move as it needs. It’s been really beautiful.
sex,ffojbn5,t1_ffoj0md,1580078275.0,"Also there’s nothing wrong with you. We are all just where we are and that looks different for everyone. I’m 29F and had sex for the first time this month with someone who is very special. He helped me feel comfortable and respected my boundaries for a couple months before I felt ready, and I was ready BECAUSE of his respect for me. Good stuff!"
sex,ffoj0md,t3_eue5k4,1580078163.0,"I felt the same way myself. I am not asexual. I started going to therapy almost a year ago. I have attachment issues (fearful avoidant attachment style) because of mental/emotional abuse from my family. I never recognized it as abuse until therapy. That’s why the idea of being close to people upset me. Even if that doesn’t resonate with you, I would still suggest trying therapy. It’s one of my favorite things to do every week. When you have a therapist that gets you, you can really do a lot for yourself. ❤️"
birthcontrol,ffcynqn,t1_ffcyfoz,1579809984.0,"Thanks! Good point. I tried to have it done then but of course my period started on Friday at 5pm on a long weekend lol. I barely bleed by day 4 and couldn’t get in until day 6. If it doesn’t work this next time, I’ll try that. She said I may need an ultrasound if the meds don’t work."
HPV,fdou657,t1_fdothf9,1578612951.0,May I ask which strain you have? Thank you for your help. This would be my first as well so I’m just really nervous about getting a high risk strain if I know about it ahead of time.
birthcontrol,fdiy0ye,t1_fdiwwmp,1578453636.0,"Good to know! My periods aren’t too heavy but I don’t really WANT them to be heavier haha. And I currently experience no pain during my period, and I’m afraid I’ll be a wimp since I haven’t built up a tolerance haha. I’ll have to look at some options. 

Yeah I used to be on the full moon! Then one month I was a couple weeks late and it’s been on the new moon every month since. I think it has to do with magic but I don’t know what. 🤣 I am a chosen one of some kind lmao. I live in the city so there are lights everywhere. What’s really weird is that I start my period about a half hour after the official new moon time. It’s fun to think that it could be magic. 🧐"
birthcontrol,fdiwnls,t1_fdiv8i6,1578452725.0,"Wonderful!!! Thank you! Yes, my knowledge was heavily naturopath informed. I appreciate you."
birthcontrol,fdijlh0,t3_elk0a9,1578444364.0,I’ve been considering this or copper IUD. I just don’t know! Glad you had a good experience!
sex,fde768s,t1_fddqmdp,1578332669.0,"Thank you. Very helpful. I actually have a fearful avoidant attachment style because of childhood trauma so it’s a big deal for me to want to go there with someone. He’s the first person that I feel really sees me, and beyond that I really enjoy his company. He’s special. I do think all of the pros outweigh the minor con. I have to get the vaccine."
sex,fao2syz,t3_ea6elg,1576256196.0,"It sounds to me that he could also be more supportive. He’s given you criticism that you’ve taken on and have been working towards but in what way is he meeting you halfway? You may not know your body anymore but maybe it’s an adjustment to him too. You’ve taken steps to take care of your health and that’s so awesome. If this is a partnership, he should be working with you to help you adjust and figure it out rather than just saying what you need to do yourself. 

Maybe part of why you don’t know your body is because he’s giving off a different vibe when interacting with it. I think we all need to work on grounding and connecting our own body and mind, so maybe meditation and practicing mindfulness will help you as an individual. Still, when you have sex, your bodies become one. It’s not about just you being different. It’s how he’s reacting to it too. He needs to work with you to figure out what the union of your bodies looks and feels like now."
sex,fakuft1,t1_fakazn8,1576173320.0,"This is great advice.

For me, I have a fearful avoidant attachment style. OP, feel free to PM me if you’d like. That style means that you want to be close to people but you’re afraid and push them away. I’m not over it yet but I’ve made great progress. I lost 90 pounds, but the weight loss still didn’t make me feel able to be intimate with anyone. Instead of being self conscious about my weight I’m now self conscious about my loose skin, stretch marks, and saggy breasts. 😔 

What’s helped me the most honestly was starting to go to therapy with a therapist that specializes in relationships, body image, and self-worth. She’s a dance movement therapist too, which doesn’t exactly mean dancing haha. It’s all about connecting body to mind to feel at peace with yourself. We do yoga, breathing exercises, and free movement together around the typical talk therapy that takes the most of our time together. I have felt more confident and free than I have my whole life. I’m learning to love myself, and learning so much about my past and how I got here. 

I’m 29F, still a virgin, but I feel so close to being ready to be with someone. I’ve been talking to someone for 3 months now and we’re going to meet next week. We were going to meet last month and I freaked. I almost ghosted him. Instead, I took my therapist’s advice and was honest with what I needed. He was great about it and I actually feel ready now. I’m sure I’ll be super awkward in person hahaha but I’m optimistic that the tools I’ve developed will get me through it. 

So my main advice is therapy! There’s a stigma about it but if you think about it, our psychology is a thing because of how our brains are wired, so it’s basically a byproduct of our biology/physiology. If you have a physical ailment, you get help. The same should be accepted and encouraged for our mental health. You’re not crazy. You might just have some unresolved trauma or bad habits that you’ve learned to protect yourself, and there are professionals that can help you overcome them. 😊

Like I said, feel free to PM me any time."
sex,fajow8d,t1_faj1lsp,1576148990.0,Thank you so much. 💕 Sending support right back at you. I really appreciate what you’ve shared with me.
