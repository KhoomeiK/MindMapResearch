Depop,fr68ggn,t3_gmwy8e,1589921743.0,"It’s been a crazy ride for me too. I use it for mostly buying rather than selling, but have been blocked by probably 100 people for the stupidest reasons. 
First off, I buy jewelry so it’s annoying when people list a purse as “sterling 10k 14k necklace earrings”. I will politely ask them to change it and they’ll block me, usually upon leaving some less than kind words in my inbox
Second, there’s the people who list an item with no intention of selling it for the listed price. I bought an $18 purse a month ago, with a description that said “send offers” at the end. I thought 18 was fair enough so bought it at that price. The woman messages me days later saying it isn’t actually for sale and when they send send offers they wanted somewhere over $40 (this was not a designer purse). I had to harass her into giving me my money back, but she kept saying she was refunding me out of the kindness of her heart and she didn’t actually have to give me my money OR the item.
Third, Brandy. Melville.
Sorry for the rant, it’s just I’ve experienced more negativity on the app than any other place. Mercari is a good place, although shipping can be a disaster. I’ve never used Poshmark but it doesn’t sound too bad. Also good old eBay is great for valuable items"

Depop,fr66yz0,t3_gmsph0,1589920995.0,I don’t really think it’s a good idea; if you list items you have on other sites and mark as “sold” as they sell it would be better than a bunch of stuff all at once.

Asia was called “the Orient” and only wealthy could afford to go, due to travel prices and honestly the people just not letting visitors in. Around the turn of the century and the world wars Asian style items became more popular as people would bring souvenirs back to their family from travels, and things like Chinese silk became popular among Americans.
Honestly it’s not at all racist to sell clothing in a certain style; when I wear antique Asian and American Indian clothing I’m not making fun of people or acting like it’s a costume, I’m appreciating the history"

Depop,fqr2hb1,t3_gkdxgh,1589576357.0,"YES.THIS. I sell on eBay and as the seller YOU are responsible for the item getting there. For expensive items you should ship with tracking and insurance (and include it in the shipping fee), and if it’s under $20 usually it’s ok to risk it, because if it doesn’t get there it’s not a big loss.
