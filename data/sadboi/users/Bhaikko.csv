When talking about graphics and shader, Linear algebra and vector math will be heavily used

When it comes to collision detection, Computational geometry is there. 

When it comes to physics and simulation, Numeical Analysis and ODEs will be used. 

It depends on what you really wanna do. Maths used in one field is often used in another and im not saying
For eg, do only computational geometry if you wanna solve collision problems.
