What I would like to know is how do we find psychotherapy for those in the psychiatric field? I have such a hard time with that. What if our therapist is a colleague? What if we have mutual patients? Is there a way to get virtual therapy from someone out of state (/country) where there will be no professional overlap? I am constantly worried about this, how will I get myself help when I’m concerned about crossing professional and personal boundaries?

nursing,fmt6sqg,t3_fx4ehz,1586367780.0,I am with you. It definitely stems from sexism and class disparity.

Also- what antidepressant misuse are you talking about? You don’t get a high or a low from antidepressants, they (if working for you) just help you feel “normal” and if they aren’t working for you, you can feel the same or worse. SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs can be literally life saving to someone severely depressed or suicidal. There’s no need to “recommend” weaning unless you are a doctor. 

OP- go to a psychiatrist or psych NP and talk about what’s going on. You don’t have to take meds unless you want to but they can be highly effective. Follow professional advice about meds not internet people. I’m a psych RN for what it’s worth."

If you have recently been diagnosed with a psychosis related disorder it’s more likely that is your primary diagnosis, and then you also have PMS (which isn’t unusual).

A lot of disorders that cause psychosis also cause ruminating thoughts, which sounds like what you’re going through.

Talk to a psychiatrist first and foremost. It sounds like whatever else is going on might be more pressing, and you might need to change up your meds.

I am a first time mom. When I went into the hospital, I had one name I was pretty sure I would go with, but I wanted a long list of other names “just in case it didn’t suit her”. My husband liked a lot of names. 

When it came to the birth, I became EXTREMELY anxious about the name choice. All of a sudden I thought, “is X name the right name? Should I go with something else? Does she “look” like an X?” It was horrible. I was in choice paralysis. Not to mention being immediately post-partum I was filled with crazy changing hormones. I ended up picking a different name entirely the 3rd day i was there and felt completely rushed since the nurses kept telling me to fill* out the paperwork. 

My husband was no help because he just wanted me to be happy, and kept saying “whatever you like”- let me tell you, in that moment, I just needed him to pick one he liked so that I could be SURE we both liked it. I couldn’t take the pressure of picking the “perfect” name.

In the end, her name is her name now and I love it.

However, moving forward with future kids- I’m going into the hospital with one name picked out. I don’t agree with the whole “yes but does the baby LOOK like that name?” question, because newborn babies don’t even look like themselves 6 months later! My daughter looks completely different now than how she came out! 

Tl;dr - just pick one name and save yourself the anxiety of picking out a name when you are post-birth and full of hormone changes and needing a bunch of rest, not a huge decision to be placed on you."
