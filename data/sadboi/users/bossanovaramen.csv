I am a first time mom. When I went into the hospital, I had one name I was pretty sure I would go with, but I wanted a long list of other names ‚Äújust in case it didn‚Äôt suit her‚Äù. My husband liked a lot of names. 

When it came to the birth, I became EXTREMELY anxious about the name choice. All of a sudden I thought, ‚Äúis X name the right name? Should I go with something else? Does she ‚Äúlook‚Äù like an X?‚Äù It was horrible. I was in choice paralysis. Not to mention being immediately post-partum I was filled with crazy changing hormones. I ended up picking a different name entirely the 3rd day i was there and felt completely rushed since the nurses kept telling me to fill* out the paperwork. 

My husband was no help because he just wanted me to be happy, and kept saying ‚Äúwhatever you like‚Äù- let me tell you, in that moment, I just needed him to pick one he liked so that I could be SURE we both liked it. I couldn‚Äôt take the pressure of picking the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù name.

In the end, her name is her name now and I love it.

However, moving forward with future kids- I‚Äôm going into the hospital with one name picked out. I don‚Äôt agree with the whole ‚Äúyes but does the baby LOOK like that name?‚Äù question, because newborn babies don‚Äôt even look like themselves 6 months later!
