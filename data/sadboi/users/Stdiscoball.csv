Transgender_Surgeries,fpqaam6,t1_fpn1hy8,1588818392.0,What state is your surgery in?
Transgender_Surgeries,fpm7m99,t3_ge5w6z,1588727209.0,First off best of luck in recovery. But... Yes I did! May 19th bottom surgery. HERE WE GOOOO.
medicine,fodro6y,t1_focqxta,1587688856.0,"Yeah I saw his statement. I reached out to the department of health for California to follow up on his statement. They don't have any legal definition for ""essential surgery"" the only thing we have in writing is the CMS guidelines that were released previously before his announcement (which are also vague) So it's ultimately up to the hospital administration as to what surgeries can be allowed. 

I understand that this is unprecedented, and we as providers don't know exactly what to do.. and our healthcare system is running into the red due to the lack of elective surgeries happening. But it ultimately shows that as someone who works in hospital administration... I don't know how we're supposed to plan for future events like this with what our current system offers."

medicine,fnn14il,t1_fnmvbyv,1587082196.0,Hmm odd we're experiencing low behavior health patients
Coronavirus,fniyuqu,t1_fnitwjm,1586988823.0,"I work in a hospital in the administration side of things. They cut our hours, and we have no PPE when we do interact with patients. We also did not receive hazard pay, and  if we do get sick from covid we have to use our PTO. Our pay isn't that good.. that it warrants our current working conditions.

 We also received some of the stimulus package as did other hospitals. Instead of doing things right by our clinical staff, they cut support staff, and now the nurses are dropping like flies because they fear their own safety, and we don't have enough support staff. Our hospital is running into the red due to covid. It's a huge mess for every state, county, public or private hospital because we were never designed to run in a pandemic. 

To make matters worse some of our staff still doesn't believe that Corona is dangerous and it's  'just like the flu' because our state and local area haven't been hit like places like NYC.  

I don't think we will see a downward trend for the U.S for awhile, and I'm not sure how long hospital staff will be able to last without PPE"
Transgender_Surgeries,fmn775e,t3_fvrj0k,1586219652.0,I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll let you know what the surgeon says once I talk to him later this week. Hopefully it‚Äôs easy to fix rather it be placement or a different type of implant
Transgender_Surgeries,fmn1mwg,t1_fmn0e9e,1586216323.0,"Mine specialized in trans care (kaiser) and I went against his advice and went with under the muscle because I had always been told it was better, and I felt that I didn‚Äôt have enough breast tissue to warrant over the muscle. However, he went with moderate profile under the muscle... now the separation of breast tissue from implant is visible and it drives me crazy"
Transgender_Surgeries,fmm7p2j,t3_fvrj0k,1586200319.0,I have the same exact issue besides the scarring issue; I‚Äôm going to bring it up to my Dr in a few days.. because  honestly while I like the size of them right now it‚Äôs kind of made my boobs wonky

Transgender_Surgeries,fj1i2p1,t3_fb0hx2,1582920514.0,Yupppp I have another surgery coming up in 2.5 months and I hope they don‚Äôt cancel it
Transgender_Surgeries,fi2trec,t3_f6234v,1582088866.0,Well I hope SRS is like FFS recovery wise as I had little to no pain... and I had everything done. It was more frustrating than painful if anything. But regardless kick ass; you‚Äôll be fine. It‚Äôs not that bad I promise ‚ù§Ô∏èyou can do it!!
Transgender_Surgeries,ffum99v,t3_euxzxs,1580244943.0,"I had the whole work up with him, and I see him in a few days... for the final check up. But it‚Äôs been I think four months now, and the tip of my nose is still swollen along with my chin. He did pretty good work, but I still can‚Äôt really breathe out of my nose. Best of luck healing; make sure to follow everything they tell you to do!!"
Transgender_Surgeries,fecn8tf,t3_enyc4p,1578978156.0,Are you able to sit down without it being super tender? I‚Äôve heard that can be one of the most annoying parts of recovery.  I‚Äôm hoping to have everything cleared out within the next few months..as I‚Äôm trying to get the electrolysis done with already.. What‚Äôs weird is kaiser was trying to get me to do laser (which I did three rounds of on my downstairs) but I requested electrolysis instead  to make sure it was permanent.Well since I can relate to those kidney stones; that makes me fairly happy that it isn‚Äôt as painful as that. Those are very painful! When you went through the process were you able to pick which surgeon you had? As I guess a few other surgeons at kaiser do it as well. How has your appetite been since having surgery?
Transgender_Surgeries,feccj4o,t3_enyc4p,1578970743.0,"First off congrats! I‚Äôll be going through my surgery with them in about five months. Are they now offering the Peritoneal pull through method? As I was only told about the standard penile inversion technique, or shallow / no depth version. How was the pain overall? When do you feel like you‚Äôll be able to go back to work without many issues? Also when you had the hair removal portion done before SRS... Did they do an inch around the shaft, and all of the scrotum? Oh and yeah when I had FFS one of the nurses kept referring to me with male pronouns, and one of them was super rude. It was a mess which was the San Leandro facility."
Transgender_Surgeries,fc3krr6,t1_fbt3yib,1577392009.0,I have Northern California kaiser and I was able to see pictures of three SRS photos in a slideshow they do for a class to teach us about SRS. I would ask about that

Transgender_Surgeries,fb6lpmq,t3_ebduwd,1576553392.0,I took pain meds for two weeks... but otherwise the mouth stitches were more annoying than actually any pain. Maybe a level 3 or 4 out of 10

You shouldn‚Äôt force your beliefs on anyone else. The kid..now grown adult not being allowed to choose what type of diet they‚Äôre allowed to have is overbearing.

Transgender_Surgeries,evlh0kh,t3_ckaboy,1564594601.0,"I do think that HRT does change the face a little bit; but I also believe some individuals get better at their make up. Make up is a powerful tool, as is HRT... So is there a disadvantage to getting FFS done a year into HRT? No I don‚Äôt think so. I will say though that my insurance, and doctor are making me wait 4-6 months after FFS before they will do SRS, as they want to make sure my healing process is going well before doing another surgery."

Once insurance paid you would get the 10k deposit back. His work looked really good, and was really knowledgeable. I now have kaiser, but if I still had BCBS I would have gone with him. I will say his office manager lady works for multiple drs and I think he needs to find someone else to handle that portion of the business. She said incorrect information regarding my insurance, and frankly didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about"

But after day three the pain went down quite a bit, and has continued to taper down. The only thing now I have is like a nerve issue in my armpit /upper arm and nipple on my left side it sometimes feels like it‚Äôs on fire. They said it‚Äôs just the nerves growing back.
