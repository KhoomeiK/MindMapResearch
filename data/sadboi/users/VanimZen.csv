cardcaptorsakura,flv4sus,t1_flux95a,1585516371.0,Got it! Once I get Mabel I‚Äôll share this one :)
cardcaptorsakura,fluiddx,t1_flu5kf3,1585503202.0,I‚Äôm not sure how to do that... let me do some research and I‚Äôll do it!
cardcaptorsakura,fltadkj,t3_fr1mg9,1585464741.0,I‚Äôm more proud of the back which has the wings but I‚Äôm barely starting to use reddit so I can‚Äôt figure out how to add another picture. I‚Äôll leave it to the imagination!

SuicideWatch,fk9kqmu,t3_f9d5go,1583977975.0,"I want to WANT to live. I‚Äôm tired. I want to die because I would be less of a burden. I‚Äôm tired of being a burden but I don‚Äôt want to put the effort and confront the things that are holding me back. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm just done. My heart is beating still but oh how I wish it would stop sometimes. Yet my debts, the effort and pain my mother suffered to bring me to this world tie me here. If only I could just fade.... I know I need help. I‚Äôm just too prideful to ask for it."
Handwriting,felwyd9,t1_felk4l4,1579233020.0,"Thank you for the links and sources! I will look through them. I just started taking my hand writing recently so I‚Äôm still a bit of a noob. 

The pens are called Scribble Stuff Felt Tip Pens and they were a gift from a coworker and they write super smoothly. She told me she got them from Target! 

I reached out because I always felt my writing seemed messy somehow but now that you mention the size of the letters, I see what the problem is, so thank you so much for pointing that out! 

Thank you so much for your help and advice!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

suggestmeabook,fec93b2,t3_eob53t,1578968820.0,"Perfume: Story of a Murderer. One of my favorites because it honestly makes you wonder about human nature. How much our instincts really tell us about others and where those instincts come from. Also,  Johannas Cabal: The Necromancer. This is more along the lines of anti-hero. He goes up against an even bigger villain than himself and it‚Äôs honestly a ride reading the book."

And no, I was not then or now that good at cursive."

There were those moments I‚Äôd look at the people around me with their friends and S/O‚Äôs and thought, ‚ÄúDamn, I wish I had someone who‚Äôd be as excited with me.‚Äù Then there were the moments I WANTED to be alone to just walk around and enjoy things without needing to worry about explaining something to someone or making sure they were enjoying their time here. In the end it‚Äôs what you make of it. Maybe next year I come on my own and let things be. Maybe by then I‚Äôll get my shit together and have an S/O or friends who also enjoy anime as much as I do."
ZeroTwo,et5wn4t,t3_c9osma,1562494036.0,I got her myself as well at AX. The smile alone is worth it.
