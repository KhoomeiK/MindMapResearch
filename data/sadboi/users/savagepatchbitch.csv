depression,esmt52b,t3_c8anzi,1562114066.0,Do you ever go back and look at the messages you sent when you were happy and then be like ‚Äúwtf was I thinking‚Äù and almost be like embarrassed? I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm explaining correctly
EDAnonymous,esmj9b4,t3_c8dkmg,1562106861.0,"I remember being 12 and a boy making fun of my ‚Äúrolls.‚Äù I felt disgusting and huge and it didn‚Äôt help that my mom would always encourage me to go on diets and tell me to suck in my stomach. I also was looking through old pictures recently and *i was not fat.*  I wasn‚Äôt thin, but I was perfectly average. This is such bullshit and it pisses me off. Kids are developing disordered thoughts and behaviors from *such* a young age and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting."

EDAnonymous,epxovp4,t1_epxnnwl,1559606744.0,Exactly. Like everyone preaches CICO but it‚Äôs not as scientifically accurate as it‚Äôs made out to be and that is absolutely terrifying. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre doomed unless we‚Äôre prepared to starve for the rest of our lives
EDAnonymous,epqr9l2,t1_epnp44x,1559410902.0,Ohh interesting.
