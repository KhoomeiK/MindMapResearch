Pitt,fplwti3,t3_ge3wk7,1588720992.0,"Perhaps because when we give you an assessment (an exam, a lab report, a paper, etc), it is a way for us to determine what level of knowledge you have, whether it is low level (simple definitions facts or plug and chug problems) or high level (evaluate data, analyze a work of literature, or bring together ideas and concepts to solve a problem).  When you cheat, we cannot assess what you know and therefore your grade becomes pretty meaningless.  You have unfairly circumnavigated the learning process in order to achieve an end (a letter grade) and in turn deprived yourself in developing your skills as a independent thinker and problem solver.  In college, that is what we are training you for, to solve problems in a particular field using a certain set of skills so that you can develop a career in that field.  

Besides all of that, it is unfair to your peers (who were honestly representing their abilities) that you used extra resources to take an exam.  Frankly, I despise the ""but everyone is doing it"" argument.  Just because something is popular does not make it right or ok to do.  For the record, in my lifetime, I have never cheated on any of my school work and I am proud to admit that.  It bothers me to see all of these cases of cheating and no one understanding how serious it is.  It also worries me that because people are cheating, that we are sending completely unprepared people out into the work force, especially in fields where someone's life may depend on their problem solving skills.  

So do yourselves a favor and study hard in your classes so that you do well.  Cheating does you and your future a great disservice."

Although I know students are having a hard time (many students are losing relatives), there are quite a few students who are taking advantage of things, which does not help.  I also think that shifting to online classes has highlighted how much students do not read or follow directions.

With emails, I found that copying and pasting some of my more common responses works as well as referring to the syllabi (which I revised for our online portion).  I have been pretty generous with deadlines, within reason.  I gave extensions to to everyone in response to students having difficulty with uploading assignments, along with some more guidance on doing that.  Although, I have been lenient on some things, I try to set some limits.  Like, when I posted at least one announcement (which was also emailed) a day about not emailing me lab assignments (imagine with 1700 students), but uploading it to blackboard and still had students who emailed me assignments.

I also did not go to school for nine years for chemistry to be a tay at home parent."
unpopularopinion,ffyuqhn,t3_evwjqh,1580355631.0,"Sure, everyone has something that annoys them.  I am annoyed when students spend whole lectures texting but claim I didn’t teach anything on an exam.  But that doesn’t offend me.  Most stand up comedy annoys me, I simply do not watch it.  I typically don’t get offended by a difference of opinion, not everyone shares my world view. I do get offended when teenagers make rude comments about my vision impairment on the bus.  I don’t see how that is all on me if they choose to make fun of something I can’t help.  I think that it is very unfair to put all of the onus on the person who is offended (not simply annoyed).  Just because there is free speech, it is not ok to verbally abuse anyone."

So, you may not care about mowing down innocent pedestrians, but I think you guys should have license plates, get tickets for traffic infractions, and have insurance."

ForeverAlone,ffcr4yh,t3_esqy8k,1579805535.0,Try seeing your crush whom you are you are afraid to approach because you don't want to lose them as a friend still consider seeing some one who you witnessed hurt them deeply.  It's like they would rather try to be with someone who hurts them but is really pretty than possibly the likes of you who may be pretty plain but would treat them really well.

unpopularopinion,ff26gnt,t1_ff240yo,1579495159.0,I actually don’t think I am any better than anyone else at all.  Because I am not.  This is just what I decided based on my education and what I observed over the years.  I don’t see any reason to judge others for what they do.
