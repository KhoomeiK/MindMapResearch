anhedonia,ff9gsxd,t1_ff9byxg,1579712700.0,"My anhedonia is complete anhedonia at this point.  When I was younger I could enjoy listening to music but I didn't enjoy anything else.  I never experienced happiness in anything that other people seem to: birthday parties, Christmas, the beach, graduations, going out with friends, relationships, parades, carnivals, festivals, concerts.  I would always be standing there thinking: ""What's wrong with me?  Why do I feel nothing?""  I had to fake enjoyment during these times because I didn't want to look weird or whatever.  I used to tell myself that I wasn't happy or able to enjoy anything because I had some stressor that I was dealing with, usually schoolwork at first then, later on, actual occupational work. I've come to realize that this wasn't the case and that, in fact, whatever has caused me to not enjoy normally fun events/moments has to do with my brain.  I have always lacked pleasure and I have always been emotionally blunted.  This started when I very young, like maybe 4 years old.  Also, I've had trichotillomania since about the age of 4.  I believe the pathophysiology of anhedonia and trichotillomania, in my case, are related.  Essentially, some disregulation of my brain's chemistry and the way it functions.  Oh, and I experienced severe migraine headaches for most of my life: starting when I was about 12 and peaking in my 30s.  I still get them but only about once every few months now.  I think the cause of the migraines is likely related in all of this as well.  I didn't know about the importance of dopamine in all of this until about the last two months.  My experimentation with the supplements on my list has, thus far, allowed me a few days where my negative ruminating seems to have been reduced but, as of yet, I'm not sure exactly which supplements have been providing the benefit.  I suspect Lion's Mane has helped and NAC, but I couldn't swear by it at this point.  I've only been trying these things in the last 4-5 weeks and I take some one day and others the next.  It's possible that there has been a synergistic effect from many of them at this point.  I'm trying to sort it out and pinpoint which ones seem to produce the best effects.  In my document, if there is a question mark after the supplement on the list at the top of the document it means I haven't yet tried that supplement and am still trying to decide whether to get some to try.

However, if this probiotic can, as the study suggests, effect  the gut biome in a way that can ultimately lead to removing whatever it  is that is damaging to dopamine and if dopamine is involved in the  reward pathways in the brain then might this probiotic be (in theory)  helpful to those of us who suffer from anhedonia which, apparently, is  thought be (if only in part) a result of dysregulation of or some  deficiency in the dopamine pathways in the pleasure centers of our  brains?  Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this."

anhedonia,fencz91,t1_fenceqz,1579282039.0,"Exactly, it's like there's some natural skill that people have that I'm missing.  I've tried to watch sports so that I could talk about the game the next day or whatever and I can't even remember what happened in the game.  Sometimes I can't even remember who won.  Also, I've always had trouble learning and remembering names of co-workers, classmates, etc.  Even when the circumstances would seem to indicated that remembering their names should be second nature or come automatically.  It has always made me really nervous."
anhedonia,fenby9z,t1_fenall0,1579281408.0,"Thank you for your message.  Weed has helped me a little bit but I don't have access to it now, unfortunately.  I've had ADHD also.  I was never able to participate in conversations.  I never understood them really.  I can't figure out why people talk about the things they do.  Most people seem content with random chit-chat.  I've always struggled to follow conversations because of the ADHD I suspect.  So, all interpersonal situations have been weird for me.  Like I'm in a cloud that I can barely see through or ""act"" through.  I've had to force myself in those situations and always looked for an excuse to leave the situations.  I used to stay home alone and organize my stuff, like obsessively.  I felt that my head was disordered because my personal space was disordered.  I have that up about 7 years ago when I was around 39 years old.  I realized that was just an ineffective coping mechanism.  My doctor is supposed to start me on Pramipexole next week.  There are a few studies (not man) that seem to indicate that it might be helpful.  Fingers Crossed."
anhedonia,fen857l,t3_eps0jj,1579279064.0,Me too.  Listening to music was about the only thing I consistently liked to do and I'm a point where I don't listen to any.  I've had anhedonia my whole life with music being about the only thing that used to consistently get my attention.  It's weird.
