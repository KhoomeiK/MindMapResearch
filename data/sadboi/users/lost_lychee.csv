medical,fpv9v8q,t3_gfeuna,1588939544.0,Im sorry to hear that. It sound awful :/ hope youll feel well soon!
medical,fptjpx7,t3_gfekv8,1588892525.0,I think you should definitely go see a doc about this. I dont think the watermelon had anything to do with the seman if it didnt tint the urine as bright as the seman then maybe its 2 diffrent issues.
medical,fptixsx,t3_gffna5,1588892106.0,"Not a health professional. Do you sleep well at night? Do you use phones and computers a lot?  Do you maybe have a sight issue that is causing you to strain your eyes and they get tired? 
If you have a pretty repetitive life style and one of these happen maybe thats why its always at the same time. 
Would recommend going to a doc for this.
Also checkout the definition and kinds of headaches there are and try to pin point what kind of headache you have a quick search on google can pull up a long list of types if head aches and the definition of a migraine."
medical,fptiahg,t3_gfeuna,1588891763.0,"Not a medical professional, Have you got blood tests done? If you had a infection it would show in your white cell count . If your not advised from a medical professional to take antibiotics i would strongly recommend you don’t.
Maybe if you are not happy with the diagnosis you can get a second opinion from a different doc that specializes in IBS he would probably know if that is the problem or not. 
Maybe also gong to a nutritionist that helps with IBS Cases ( if that is indeed what you have ) and they can help you build the right menu for you."
medical,fpthhvz,t3_gffwip,1588891342.0,"Probably not, i am not a medical professional, but i know that the major things that affect growth is sleep and nutrition. Make sure to eat well and balanced and sleep at least 8 hours a night and most important don’t go to sleep after 11. You need to sleep at night no at day. 
Men grow until they are 21 if I’m not mistaken and can some times have a few growth jumps. Btw your pretty tall TBH.
I believe that if proteins would have cause growth problems in teen kids it would be illegal to use them at that age or to buy. 
Also there is nothing really bad about vitamins most young people probably don’t eat enough any way. But instead of take supplements eat veggies and fruits the old fashion way. Your body has been built over 100,000 years for the task of breaking down food and using the nutritions so you should trust your body and give its what it needs in a way that he knows how to use. Your young and probably healthy. Your body is at its prime. 

So remember eat well and sleep well and you will be fine. The sleep part is super important because sleep deprivation is super serious and dose a-lot of harm to your body. Good nutritional Food important as much as well."
medical,fptfa5n,t3_gfglfs,1588890190.0,* i don’t work with water and i wash dishes with gloves and so i wash my hands primarily when I’m cooking and after the restroom. ( i saw that it might cause problems with nails)

relationships,fpjbfca,t3_gdr6i6,1588662528.0,"Well first of all, you should definitely show her this post. 
Second of all, things already have changed, you have feelings fer her now and that means that maybe even if you wont say anything the dynamic has all ready shifted. And also i think you should tell cause its important to put things on the table."
bookclub,fpf4cea,t3_g82vuc,1588561479.0,Thnaks for the advice !
bookclub,fpf48ha,t1_fol8rs2,1588561403.0,Thanks i feel dumb for not thinking of that myself!
EatingDisorders,fme39ly,t3_fogdib,1585987537.0,"I am so sorry that your going through this. 

It’s horrible and it absolutely doesn’t help you. I think you should blank out  tell her that what she is doing is the wrong thing to do and that she as a mother is now helping you get worse instead of well and in that hurting her daughter. 

And if she dose not understand or cares about than you have to find a away she will. 
maybe making your dad understand or maybe a teacher can help you. You need someone to back you up and say to her(your mom) “ya no , what you are doing is not ok”, then thats what you need to do and even if just give you support that you need in general. 

And in regards to you and your health, maybe you should see a therapist if you aren’t. Its so important to deal with this and move on to the next stage where you are stronger and much more able to deal, and that comes through therapy.

Love you with all my heart and i really hope everything will be ok xxxxx"
