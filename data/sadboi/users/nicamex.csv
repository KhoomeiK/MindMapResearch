ApexUncovered,fp025j7,t3_gahyk9,1588201072.0,"So maybe a guess here. Subject A, B, and C are supposed to be test subjects specifically of simulacra? Because if not it could be three legends already in the game. 

Crypto as a cyborg
Pathfinder as an android 
Revenant as a simulacrum 

The only one that has cooperated enough is pathfinder while the other two want to destroy Hammond (Hence why Rev and Crypto might team up). 

I’m probably wrong but just throwing it out there."

AskMen,fkjh8tb,t3_fila8z,1584245856.0,I’ve recently just started really getting into lifting and after a month of strict lifting (diet could be better but sometimes I don’t have the means) a girl was checking me out yesterday as I lifted. I wasn’t sure until she looked directly at me and smiled at me and waved. This has never happened and I didn’t know how to react. I’m surprised and flattered. Will go back next week around the same time just for the ego boost.

mealtimevideos,fipgahx,t1_fiop9zn,1582606091.0,Fuck man. This is so sad. I hope he enjoyed it in his finals moments because damn that’s such a brutally beautiful perspective.
mealtimevideos,fioeneh,t3_f8tuxc,1582581758.0,So touching. I think when he says that asking “what’s the point?” Is “ironic” and a “foolish question” he might mean that asking someone else what the point of YOUR life is stupid because it’s for you to find out. I could also be wrong.

StandUpWorkshop,fho5qm1,t1_fho56wb,1581742369.0,Alright that’s fair.
StandUpWorkshop,fho3p16,t1_fha4xbm,1581740435.0,Idk since there’s people who might believe the story so you might walk around with a weird rep because of it. I say stick with the friend.
StandUpWorkshop,fho3l3v,t1_fhbwz6b,1581740332.0,I mean ok but just replace it with “train wreck” and it’s a pretty solid joke
StandUpWorkshop,fho3h78,t1_fhbg45e,1581740236.0,"“She told me to bottle everything up, so I think she wants me to kill myself” *pause for laughter* then your last line as a tag"
StandUpWorkshop,fho2yfv,t1_fho2po9,1581739760.0,Hey I just wanna make sure no one is discouraged from doing comedy because of jokes they’re not sure how to figure out. Also say “soooooo Pornhub was down so I subscribed to a premium Snapchat” as the start of that one joke.
StandUpWorkshop,fho2pk5,t3_f3d5ia,1581739535.0,"I think the first one is really good. 

The other two aren’t that great and unfortunately I can’t save them. 

I owe you two. Lmk when you post some more so I can help with those."
StandUpWorkshop,fho2ipn,t3_f3hc02,1581739360.0,"First joke: Instead of “I chimed in...” and the rest of that joke, just say “and I thought to myself “wow what a whore” 

Second joke: Switch the Arby’s and the roast beef. Take out “ads”. 

Third joke: this is fucked up and gold. If the crowd is responding well to the really dark jokes, throw this in at the end. 

Fourth: try “Premium snapchats? But they’re ugly as hell most of the time. They should be called “super regular” snapchats” or something. The other one is ok but try to find something that’s more common for mid grade gasoline. 

All pretty good. I’m glad I read these."
StandUpWorkshop,fho1n6a,t1_fhno3hr,1581738588.0,"Or just “jokes on her, I have cum stains on both. 

*pause for laughter* 

What? I need my cereal and M I L K

*pause again*

I like pouring cereal first since it’s easier to mix” 

Idk if that’s too much but you could use that if you want."
StandUpWorkshop,fhnn78q,t1_fhkl28q,1581729137.0,Would love to see how a crowd responds to this
StandUpWorkshop,fhizrv5,t3_f3bz97,1581635181.0,This almost seems too real. I say take the first sentence and put it at the end and make the fact that you lied the punchline.

StandUpWorkshop,fg2vqup,t3_ewj808,1580457973.0,"If you want this joke to work, you have to play the character. You have to play the overtly misogynistic asshole but so much that you contradict yourself a lot and make it look incredibly ironic. To be able to actually pull that off would be challenging to say the least. For tips on how to pull it off I suggest going to people irl and asking about times they’ve seen misogynistic irony or stuff like that and use that as material."
