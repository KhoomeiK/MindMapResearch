Dang. I really didn't even realize that. I agree with you completely, I just wish people realize how hurtful words can be. But I guess you need to let those people march to their own beat. Eventually they might realize being hateful isn't the way to go. One can only hope.

Anyway, thank you for the lovely insight :) I hope you have a wonderful day <3"

I feel a strong sense of pride being a minority (Jewish). 

I found out recently that we should not tolerate hate. Hate should never tolerated, nor should you use your freedom of speech to bring down a group of people, it's no longer 'freedom of speech' it's just blatantly being a bigot by twisting something that was meant for all, to benefit all, so that everyone can say something without being harmed. But if you want to be an asshole and abuse that privilege to be hateful, sucks to be you. Hope you get punched in the face.
