Kalm - a lock screen tweak that actually makes the lockscreen useful and look good - https://repo.chariz.com/

Filza - the definitive file manager For modern iOS. This is actually truly a necessity - https://tigisoftware.com/cydia/

NewTerm - a Terminal for iOS. Doesn't sound as useful as it is (seriously once you run into a weird issue you can only solve with a command you'll be happy you got this) - https://repo.chariz.com/

Snowboard - perhaps the best theme manager there is. As you may be able to tell already, this allows you to apply themes to your device (change app icons, fonts, system icons, dock, UI, respring icon, etc...) But be sure to also grab all the available extensions - https://sparkdev.me/repo/

Viola - while we are on the topic of themes, let me just tell you about one of the best ones out there: Viola (and all it's extension themes, which include Viola Dark, Viola Black, and Viola Glyphs) which is a really clean and beautiful theme and is a personal must have - https://repo.packix.com/

Cr4shed - a proper good crash log reporter (although alternatively you may wanna try crash reporter if you find that Cr4shed isn't working right) - https://repo.packix.com/

iCleaner Pro - if you want to manage your device storage right, get iCleaner Pro. Allows you to do a cleanup of things like caches, attachments, and generally unnecessary things clogging up storage. It also allows for some troubleshooting features such as being able to disable certain tweaks, which will come in handy if you're running into some issues and wanna identify what tweak is causing them - https://ib-soft.net/cydia/ or if you want the iCleaner Pro betas, check https://ib-soft.net/cydia/beta/

ReProvision - an on device method of resigning apps that is easier and more convenient than AltStore - https://repo.incendo.ws/

Activator - if you want custom guestures to do custom stuff, this is your go to tweak! - https://rpetri.ch/repo/

Installer - an alternative to Cydia (another package manager) with many features that Cydia is lacking as well as STILL being updated by it's original developer - https://apptapp.me/repo/  or if you wanna check out the beta version, go to https://beta.apptapp.me/

Zebra - yet another package manager. It really depends whether you keep this or Installer on your device based on preference - https://getzbra.com/repo/ or if you want the beta version go to https://getzbra.com/beta/

AppStore++ - gives AppStore more functionality, such as the ability to downgrade apps - https://cokepokes.github.io/"

jailbreak,fpa0tv2,t3_gc7y37,1588438531.0,"Cercube - adds a SHIT TON of functionality to the YouTube app, such as picture in picture playback- https://apt.alfhaily.me/

Installer - by far the superior package manager - https://apptapp.me/repo/

Filza - This one is more of a necessity than anything. It's a file manager, and it's great at what it is - https://tigisoftware.com/repo/

Viola - not technically a tweak, but rather an amazing theme. Trust me, you'll love it - https://repo.packix.com/

AppStore++ - adds some VERY necessary functionality to the AppStore, such as the ability to downgrade apps and block updates on apps - https://cokepokes.github.io/

NewTerm - the best terminal available for iOS - https://repo.chariz.com/

OpenSSH - AGAIN, this one is more of a necessity than anything, as it allows you to run terminal commands on your device from another device - repo varies based on which jailbreak you're using; if you're using Unc0ver or Checkra1n, download OpenSSH from https://apt.bingner.com/ but if you've jailbroken via Chimera, I believe OpenSSH should already be downloaded on your device.

Snowboard - simply the best theming engine there is (allows you to change app icons, fonts, settings icons, etc...) - https://sparkdev.me/

Axon - notification organization done right. This sorts notifications by app rather than in a cluttered mess - https://repo.co.kr/

Activator - this is a tweak you're not gonna wanna miss. Allows you to set custom guestures to do... Pretty much anything you want (shake device to activate/deactivate flashlight, activate Google Assistant by holding power/home button rather than Siri, etc...) - https://rpetri.ch/repo/

Kalm - lockscreen done right! Kalm is a beautiful and really handy tweak for the lockscreen that serves you all the information you need at a glance in a minimalist and convenient fashion - https://repo.packix.com/

Prysm - control centre done right! Prysm is a beautiful replacement to the stock control centre which really makes you question why we've been okay with Apple's CC for so long - https://repo.packix.com/

HomePlus - a tweak that gives you the ability to customize your lock screen to just the way YOU like it - https://repo.openpack.io/ (I believe. It may be another repo)"
