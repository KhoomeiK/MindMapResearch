Saab mechanic was willing to take it for trade on a 91 245 he needed to finish de-rusting and while he finished that “for a couple weeks” he gave me a loaner 244. It took him 6 months to finish the car he was going to sell me. The loner was nice, but it was an automatic. Ugh. Otherwise, a decent little car. YUGE trunk.      
91 245, 250k miles, 5 speed. Black on black with lots   Mechanic finally finished my car and took his loner back. I realized just how rough the loaner was. I picked it up just after a blizzard and learned that a rwd car is full of surprises in the snow. Wheee! It was smooth and heavy and the heater rocked and I loved it dearly. New mechanic became a Volvo mentor and coach, I got deep into that car and learned to be a letter mechanic. After 5 years it was rusty and the transmission was getting weird. I needed a new one.

Sure, there was the rest of the city and there were plenty of long subway or bike rides (me or him), but that was a pain. It was better than small town app fun."

""Bro, try my grandma's chile rellenos, only a dollar"" is maybe the best life pro tip I've ever been given."

I'm conflicted: it's entrapment, it doesnt appear to be reducing incidents, and it's cheap virtue-tv for ratings. AT THE SAME TIME I have my hopes: that someone thinking about doing this will think on these segments and not go assault a kid out of fear. Or even better, go get therapy. There's got to be a better way..."
