BipolarDisorderReddit,fjq6g07,t3_feq9s8,1583568573.0,"I recommend checking out Marbles and Rock Steady by cartoonist Ellen Forney ! She has bipolar disorder and in both books she gives a lot of insight as to how to cope with bipolar symptoms in everyday life . Rock Steady is more so a survival guide than anything else while Marbles is about her life leading up to, and after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

I tend to paint or write when I’m depressed. I play fetch with my dog or take him for walks. Movies or TV shows via Netflix/Hulu. YouTube. MUSIC! Comic books! Talking to someone. Podcasts! I spend time with family. Video games. Anything to keep me out of my head! I’m no expert and have a ton of growing to do as far as managing my symptoms and life but these are some things that come to mind that have all got me through a depressive episode or at least helped get me through an hour or two. 

Meds, therapy, support groups, family, and my dog are a few things that are permanently part of my treatment plan. 

I’d also like to add that abstaining from recreational drugs has proven to be a healthier choice for me. My symptoms only worsen when I smoke weed or drink or abuse any drug really. 

I hope at least one thing I wrote here helps you! 

*Pro tip : “BPD” stands for Borderline Personality Disorder . “BP” stands for Bipolar Disorder."
