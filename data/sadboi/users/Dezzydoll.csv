Basically, what you're saying is that you think they're awful people, but you don't care and you believe your negative view (that's out in the open) has no impact on their lives. Which isn't true, it does. You can believe someone is shitty for what they do, but when it becomes a public discussion it has a ripple effect on the people involved. You're free to have your own feelings, but you have to understand that it does have an impact on others. Whether it's affecting how they see the world, how they treat those people, or how those people see themselves, it has an impact.

Not wanting to be in a relationship or share a soda is fine, but judging them for their choices is wrong, especially when you've been involved in their line of work. You have every right to separate yourself, but by judging you perpetuate the belief that there's something wrong with them, there's something wrong with that line of work, and that they're bad people for choosing it. You can't say it's okay and insult them in the same paragraph. Either you have a problem with it or you don't.

While I'm not a fan, I'm not going to look down on someone for their choices. Often the people who get into the sex trade start off as either runaways who met a pimp or people desperate for cash. I know it's a profession that tends to have a lot of negative repercussions, including an increased risk of STIs and STDs, but I'm not going to look down on a person for their choice. Just like I wouldn't look down on a person for working in fast food. 

Yes, you're entitled to see a person who does work in the sex industry that way, but the mindset is one that causes a lot more damage than you realize.

I did end up addressing that recently and it led to us doing a video chat which helped with not being able to spend any quality time with him. Hasn't done much to reduce the jealousy though. 

Just trying to navigate this. My husband has never dated someone I knew and grew close with. It's always been strangers.

The reason I don't think she will understand the distancing is because she went out of her way to ask me and him if it would be a problem for them to start talking to make sure things were okay between everyone. At first I was excited for him and the more things have gone on the more jealous I've been feeling. I've had quite a few conversations with him about it and he really has gone over the top to make sure I know I'm still a priority to him. 

I just can't seem to reconcile it with everything going on. Not being able to see him, struggling to find new topics to discuss or making the most of what conversations we do have knowing they're having much more engaging ones and that's why he's not as responsive with me.

Withdrawal from friends or usual activities

Changes in behavior — such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or changes in school performance

Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence

An apparent lack of supervision

Frequent absences from school

Reluctance to leave school activities, as if he or she doesn't want to go home

Attempts at running away

Rebellious or defiant behavior

Self-harm or attempts at suicide



Sometimes a parent's demeanor or behavior sends red flags about child abuse. Warning signs include a parent who:

Shows little concern for the child

Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child

Blames the child for the problems

Consistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as ""worthless"" or ""evil""

Expects the child to provide him or her with attention and care and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child

Uses harsh physical discipline

Demands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance

Severely limits the child's contact with others
Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all


Child health experts condemn the use of violence in any form, but some people still use corporal punishment, such as spanking, as a way to discipline their children. Any corporal punishment may leave emotional scars. Parental behaviors that cause pain, physical injury or emotional trauma — even when done in the name of discipline — could be child abuse."

It's the grandma's job to teach her how to behave and what does she do? Insults her, gets in her face, and physically abuses her when the grandma doesn't get what she wants. Exactly the same behavior everyone is insulting THE CHILD WHO IS STILL LEARNING HOW TO CONTROL HERSELF for. But no one expects the ADULT WHO KNOWS BETTER to act their age?

Boyfriend and I don't frequently get time together and will take advantage of opportunities when they arise. Friday the 13th him and I went out for flash tattoos and then came back to my place while husband was at work. All was fine and dandy, things got heated, we lost track of time. I completely forgot that on Fridays my youngest daughter is picked up by her grandmother on her father's side (who knows nothing about our lifestyle) who then brings her back to my house to drop off her backpack and violin. 

Things had just finished up, when boyfriend says he hears voices outside. My first thought is ""Naww, it's probably just the neighbors or something."" When suddenly, daughter and her grandmother open the BACK door to the room boyfriend is sitting in. With no pants on. 

Thankfully the room was dim and they were walking in from a very bright day. Boyfriend runs to the bathroom and hides, my naked ass goes and puts on the first dress I find (which also happens to be way too short) and I'm left picking up our clothes in front of her grandmother. All while realizing that she just walked into the house, with me and some dude she does not know naked in the back room, and my husband is nowhere to be found.

With psychs it's hit or miss. Some are good, but not good for you. Some are fantastic, but shit happens and you can't keep seeing them.

Any psychiatrist worth their salt will start you on the one with the least side effects. The meds dont make symptoms just stop either.

Borderline,f82446h,t3_dyle45,1574183570.0,"It's not uncommon to have both. Frequently, kids who are raised by parents who are bipolar (but do not have borderline) will have both. The symptoms are very similar, but one of the biggest distinctions is how frequently the mood cycles happen and how you cope with those. 

People with BPD will have rapid shifts in mood happen daily, where as with Bipolar Disorder, the states last for much longer and may have no identifying event to trigger a manic or depressive episode. With men, the manic episodes are much more clear and aren't present in BPD. Fast talking, moments where less sleep is needed, energy that goes on for days. 

With BPD, you don't frequently have moments of clear functioning when not in an episode because it's personality. Bipolar disorder will have a clear distinction. That's part of what makes diagnoses of both difficult, because you can have those episodes, but still struggle with mood management in between those episodes.  

Then there's splitting, which may be present in Bipolar disorder based on certain uses of language (I love you, I hate you) but are more common with BPD. Which leads to the extreme fear of abandonment. That's not usually present with Bipolar Disorder, but is a must for BPD. 

Lastly, mood stabilizers will have a noticeable effect on behavior, where as medications with BPD just make management easier, but don't stop symptoms. 

As for personal experience with both, I do have minor manic episodes, more frequent depression episodes (which is common with women) I'll tell you right now though, the mood stabilizer I'm on has done wonders for just clearing up my ability to function daily. My anti-depressant helps with the daily down moods that hit me (and oddly enough my anxiety) but those intense feelings are still present throughout the day. I've done the work too, been in therapy and learned to practice my coping skills, but I still struggle on a very regular basis. I couldn't see my depressive episodes clearly until I was on anti-depressants and still experiencing periods of intense depressive episodes. Getting on the mood stabilizer has drastically improved that. I still have triggering events that can throw me out of sorts for a while, but often times I can pull myself out of them. Something I couldn't do when not on either medication."

Borderline,f6tmqn0,t3_dt0ing,1573151262.0,"The first thing you have to do is remember people aren't your abuser. When you apologize, if they say it's okay, believe them. One of the things that gets tough when you've been in an abusive relationship is believing others when they tell you it's okay. Trust turns to black and white, but in reality trust isn't that. It's some shade of gray. 

Take the time to write out your friends and what level of trust you have with each of them. Justify that trust with actions, not opinions of yours. Don't allow it to be completely black or white. The closer to a light gray they are, the more likely they are to be honest. Remind yourself when they tell you something that you believe them. If it were you talking to your friend about how they're having a tough time, would you want them to believe you? Apply that to friendships. 

Next, find other reasons they didn't talk or aren't replying. Do they have a family or job? What level of trust do you have with them? Could they just be busy or have a hard time knowing what to respond to what you've said? 

Lastly, consider that it's emotionally draining to talk to you (BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD THING!!!) When a person is emotionally drained, just like you, they sometimes have to step back and recharge. It doesn't mean they don't love or care about you, just that they need a moment to reboot. 

It's a daily challenge to remind yourself that those negative thoughts come from the abuse and to combat them. The more you work on putting positive thoughts into your head, the easier it becomes. <3 If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always up for a conversation."
relationship_advice,f6pc9v6,t1_f6p8hwh,1573053037.0,"He's doing that to you on purpose to normalize the idea of him abusing children and justifying it towards you. By changing it from pedophila to an acronym like MAP it makes it sound okay that he wants to have sex with young children. If it were a man telling you he wanted to have sex with 11-13 year old girls, how would you react?  

Regardless, you, as an adult, have a responsibility to inform the scout leaders and his nephew's parents of what's going on. Take it from someone who was sexually abused by an adult, you need to do this for those children so if they were harmed, they can get on the path to getting help. As of right now, you are the only person capable of saving the children he's preying on. 

If you stay with him, that's your choice and I commend you for it, but don't think you're doing him a favor by encouraging his use of terms like MAP and shielding him from the repercussions of involving himself in authority positions with the kind of children he wants to fuck. 

If you say nothing, knowing what you know, you are as much an accomplice to any abuse that will (and potentially has) happened."

When I was talking with her I shared that it is a lengthy process, but the best thing she can do is just be there for him and not look at him as a fragile piece of glass. It's easy to behave like a person who's suffered a trauma needs to be tip-toed around, but all they want is to feel normal. The more you treat them like that, the more it reinforces the negative feelings associated with said trauma. At least, that's been my personal experience.

offmychest,f3872di,t1_f3827yi,1570734004.0,"I'm gonna tell you a story, friend. 

When my cousin was 5, he was molested by his father. Though his father was taken to court and forced to register as a sex offender, my cousin was never made to go to therapy and his emotionally/physically abusive mother didn't help. When I was 7 and he was 10, he molested me. He was a confused, hurting kid who really didn't understand exactly what he was doing or how it affected me. Mainly because his dumb mother never put him in any kind of treatment. I didn't tell my family until I was well in my 20s, and even then they didn't believe me. 

My cousin ended up fathering two boys. His lazy ex expected him to work full time, care for the kids, and do all the chores in the house. One day, his older son managed to cut his foot on a broken mirror nobody had cleaned up. They were supposed to bring him back after a few weeks to remove the stitches, but didn't. Our uncle had to force him to take his son to the hospital about 4 weeks later than what they told the family. CPS investigation ensues. Cousin voluntarily gives up rights to his children. 

I don't know if this is what he TOLD my grandma, or if this was just her belief. She said he let it happen so he wouldn't molest them. That he was afraid, but couldn't turn himself in and become the same monster his father was. 

Don't get me wrong, it's fucked, it's not justifiable, and its sick. Most who do this are just as much victims as they are abusers. I don't think my cousin deserves the electric chair. If he had tricked a child into coming to his house and did that, he definitely deserves jail time and one hell of a punishment. If he legit let his kids go because he was afraid of what he'd do to them... Sounds to me like he's trying to be better. 

Just my opinion though."

If you can get proof of your current income (bank statement or pay stubs) and a letter from someone you know stating you are currently homeless it'll go even faster. Usually they only need proof of income and proof of address for you to start receiving services. It's definitely an issue in all states, but it doesn't mean it's gonna stay that way!

I work with the homeless population in AZ to help find resources to shelters and other helpful institutions. If you get access to a phone, dial 211 and ask about the closest shelter and day program for the homeless. Those day programs can help with housing, hot meals, washing laundry, and just keeping you under a roof for a few hours a day. Your state assistance program should offer food assistance (for the time being so you can focus on saving money) and a working cell phone as well. 

Don't be afraid to see if local churches can help you out also, you don't have to be religious to be a part of the community they're serving. Some will even help with initial cost of moving into an apartment if the funds are available.
