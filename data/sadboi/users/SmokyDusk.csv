>That's what you saw though, and I'd agree that it does look absurd looking over it. But it's not my doing. It's absurd I had to over-specify every little thing the way I did to these naysayers so they would understand the situation

You don't have to over-specify. You wanted to know if you were TA for using your fancy spray. If you'd specified that he was a domestic abuser, you would have only gotten NTA votes. So the only possible outcome was NTA.

As for the ""frustrated moral philosopher,"" I don't think your post was a question of morals at all. Is it immoral to use an armpit spray that an abuser doesn't like? Not at all. It's not a question of morality, because how can it be immoral to use a spray in your own space? It's not about morals. You wanted to know if you should stop using your antiperspirant since it annoyed someone you hate.

Is it *immoral* to use your own space as you see fit? No. This has nothing to do with moral philosophy. It says to ask about arguments you don't know if you were in the wrong in, to be fair, but you yourself have said that you thought the YTAs were unreasonable, so you know that you were not in the wrong.

AITA is not intended to be a place where you go in and have everyone tell you that you were right for annoying a domestic abuser.

This particular subreddit points out cases where it's obvious that it's not a real moral quandary and where the OP is clearly not in the wrong.

Your post asks AITA for using your anti-perspirant. That's small potatoes. You're very obviously not in the wrong for using your room and bathroom for your own purposes, which is why we would call it a validation post.

I think it's an avalanche of events that OP caused, and it's made things a lot more stressful for a lot of people.

The parents said they didn't want OP in their lives, both directly to OP via a message and indirectly by closing the adoption, and OP pushed the issue.

Anything that happened after the dad's message saying to leave them alone was based on the chain of reactions that began with OP's choices. Their entire family has majorly shifted because of one Facebook comment.

So... OP started this by commenting on a photo with two kids in it and asked why they weren't listed?? There are two kids in the picture. You say ""three kids,"" and people start wondering if there's a dang ghost in the picture, or if they have a third one on the way.

OP chose the most confusing place possible to start the drama. I suppose they could have said ""wish I could be there"" or something instead, but their comment just didn't make sense as it was.

OP's parents were together, then OP started drama, then OP's parents separated. Yeah, it's OP's fault, and if they can't admit that, then they need to actually consider how their actions affect other people."

He wants to divorce a dying woman? And only hasn't because of money?

Something not being in the rulebook doesn't automatically mean it's within appropriate bounds. Are you *Air Bud* or something?

There are lots of things that there aren't specific rules for, but that doesn't mean they're acceptable behavior.

And you didn't do it because they're cheaters--you did it because you wanted better grades."

I've never shaved my legs, and I didn't shave my armpits until I was a senior in high school because I got self-conscious after an outdoor event where I was sleeveless and got too anxious to lift my arms.

I also have chipmunk cheeks! They changed when I got older, so they aren't as prominent as they used to be. No one ever made fun of me to my face about them, but I was super self-conscious about it.

I don't look that great in makeup either! I try to wear a little from time to time, like a bit of a lip tint and some mascara.

I didn't really wear dresses until I was an adult and found some that I actually liked.

I'm still figuring things out, but thinking of myself as nonbinary has really helped recently. If nothing else, if you don't feel comfortable with a label like that (genderqueer, genderfluid, etc.), you might like the term ""gender non-conforming."" It's a wider umbrella that basically says you don't really conform to AFAB gender norms.

Have you looked at the Gender Wiki?  
[https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Gender\_Wiki](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Gender_Wiki)

I consider myself a femby (not to be confused with femboy!!):  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/femby/](https://www.reddit.com/r/femby/) 

It's okay to be confused and uncertain. Try making a list of things that make you feel good or feel bad about your identity and gender, or signs that you are not cis. I didn't know how many I had until I made my SpongeBob meme up there! \^ I actually had like 20 more things that I didn't include.

I've referred to myself as ""cis-ish,"" which is probably a hint that I am not cis, lol. If you've spent this much time and effort to consider your gender, you might not be cis."

*Throwaway Account because my friends know my real account, obviously. Apologies, as English isn't my first language, and I'm on mobile since I'm on the toilet.*

A few details about myself. I'm a 14M with a six-figure salary for one business and a seven-figure salary for another, even though I grew up poor and mistreated because of my step-mother, parents, and family friend. I hate kids and vegans and am extremely intelligent and extremely good-looking. Now, onto the story.

After attending a funeral, I went to a family dinner as part of a baby shower right before a wedding this weekend, and I was surprised to see my pregnant ex, my estranged drug-addict parent, and even my previous veterinarian. I was livid as the host knew I hated them because they are vegan and religious and aren't even wholesome redditors and had promised they wouldn't come.

Well, I walked right over to them, and was about to give me a piece of my mind, when next to them appears their trans and obese crotch-goblin (also a racist bully), the physical embodiment of veganism in a wheelchair, and the pope himself, because he received an invitation as a joke. I almost threw up on the spot. How dare they bring those MONSTERS to this event? Especially after they said it would be too expensive to bring my entire theatre troupe!

Then, because he was bored, the crotch-goblin screamed about wanting a pony, then announced that I am his father and the product of my affair with my mother, and broke a very expensive vase that they were going to sell to pay for the wedding ceremony. Then they started telling me to pay for it! All because I might have pushed the kid a little after he entered a radius of 400 feet away from me.

So what did I do? I walked up to the host and screamed, ""I'm done with this! Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, because this is the least wholesome event I've ever been to."" On my way across the floor, I grabbed my gifts: an expired Jack-in-the-Box gift card and a perfume sample from a magazine. Everyone was staring at me, but I didn't care about their opinions. I walked right out the door, but not before I got fired as the caterer.

I called an uber, lyft, and limo service and didn't look back. Then the three drivers had to do a trial by combat to see who would be lucky enough to have the privilege of driving me home. I then went no-contact with the drivers and everyone at the event.

This morning, I woke up to 37 missed calls, my phone literally blowing up with thermite, and boys blowing up our phones, phones. I'm glad my phone exploded, so I don't have to worry about this anymore. Literally every person in existence and every single irrelevant person was calling me TA, but I know I'm not because I'm good-looking, rich, a devout follower of the hivemind of reddit, because I'm wholesome 100.

I had saved up my hard earned money to buy these for her. My GF is a big jewellery lover and I do not think these she had these sort of earrings (important for later). I bought them and put a lovely card with them.

>I had a party for my GF at my home, inviting most of her family and friends. Her childhood best friend (I will call her sally) came early to help me set it up. I told Sally what I bought my GF and she said that I picked a really good gift. Everyone except GF showed up because she was running late from a 3 and a half hour shift. We surprised her when she came through the door and immediately started presents. She opened all most of them without thanking any of the people who bought them for her. She got to my present and I made it clear it was mine. She opened it and she did not react. She said:

>People were shocked. Her mother told her to be grateful. Sally then interjected and told my GF that the earrings were lovely and she should read the card that went along with it.

I said to my GF ""If you don't like them so much I will just give it to someone who is grateful.""  
>  
>The party inadvertently came to an end when my GF stormed off to her room. Nobody really said anything to me but quickly left. Her best friend and Gf's mother stay to try and console her. Apparently what I did was despicable, said by my GF. She said that she was having a bit of a bad day. She also said that if I was so willing to give away those earrings I would be more prone to cheating if our relationship went rocky. That is absolutely not how I saw things. I saw it as her being an ungrateful spoiled brat. I lashed out like that because I spent a lot of money on the earrings. Sally returned the earrings to me but I told her she can keep it.

Excuse me but if you really loved me you would not have ghosted me during this time with everything going on. I understand cooling off from her birthday celebration but not asking if I am okay during this time and being isolated at my apartment? Give me a break! Seriously! It hurts to have to throw away this 3 and a half year relationship but I cannot be with someone who ghosts someone when their livelihood could be endanger.  
>  
>I asked if if she was alright during this time and if she needed any help with supplies. She left me on read and did not ask if I was okay! I realised that she only texted me back because I have decided to cut off the attention and my pathetic attempts at trying to get her back over text. She realised that I have mentally checked out of the relationship and she HATEs that she does not have the power anymore. I ended up answering one of her phone calls and she tells crying that she ""is sorry and that we should try again"". I tell her that ""you should have thought about that for trying to string me along. Don't pity yourself sweetheart because you brought it upon yourself. You are a spoiled brat who I made the mistake of thinking I could love you. Once I end this phonecall I will not be feeding you attention. I will also be finding a younger, hotter, thinner woman who will appreciate my gifts. It's a shame Sally is a lesbian.""

>Potentially. I have finally cut the cord over text. She has not given me closure so either she wants nothing to do with me or she wants to string me a long and ""prove my love"". I personally think it is the latter because she has apparently ghosted ex bfs in the past to ""teach them a lesson""

I actually saw something recently about an HOA that made people personally get signatures from everyone in the HOA about the color of their house. And even if they do that, the request can still get rejected.

Just imagine a PTA that's for houses instead of children. HOAs are often for racist soccer moms, basically.

""Birth-giver"" is fine, but ""incubator"" is not. ""Incubator"" implies that her only purpose is as an object that contained and incubated your child. She is a person. An incubator is not a person."

AmITheAngel,flkqvpm,t3_fp3cz5,1585245991.0,How did YTA become the ruling here? There's not a lot of conflict here (which is already against the rules). She just doesn't want to be near her sister when she smokes. There's literally nothing wrong with that. I wouldn't let a smoker wear my clothes. I don't really see anything wrong with her refusing to shopping together either.

How is that chilling out? She wanted him to not go overboard, so he immediately said, ""What if I go all out and make a simple introductory dinner into something complicated and competitive?"""

Not sure if OP loves the daughter more than the wife does or more than he loves his wife.

>But despite all that I'd still trade my adoptive daughter and all that me, my wife and her have experienced together, just to see my biological daughter again. If only for a day or something like that. It sounds bad 

... That's because it *is* bad. You would ditch your teenage daughter that you knew from being only months/weeks old just for one day with your dead one? What a monster.

How could a person ever dream of saying this to their child?

I hope OP's wife sees this and learns what a horrible person she married. I know AITA and Reddit go all ""dump the whole man"" too easily, but this is one of those cases where it's appropriate. I don't even want kids, and I couldn't imagine staying with a human (robot?) that felt like this.

I feel gross just for having read this. I really, really hope this is fake."
