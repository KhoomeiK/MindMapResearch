For my attempt to jump start you again I'd like to tell you about how awesome it is to own a house; my partner & I were lucky enough to move into our first right before lockdown & it has been life saving, honestly I don't know how we would've survived this otherwise! 

It took a loooong time to get here, a lot of saving, hard work, & quite a bit of stress toward the end, don't want to trivialise it at all, it took effort but was worth it.

I've got home-improvement projects to keep me busy & they do keep me busy, you look up how to do a job (you can even drag this out while procrastinating & call it extra reading) you go start it, you nearly always discover hurdles to overcome & have to research those too, you end up feeling like you've actually learned & done something good ... honestly man, I stripped a wall & painted it white, I am unreasonably proud of that wall, it's probably far from what a professional could do but I did it myself with my own elbow grease (haven't shopped for power tools yet coz lockdown, & also they're expensive,) & it looks pretty good, for sure better than it did before. I hope to give myself lots of chances to feel pride in my work, it's a really good feeling.

And the freedom, it's yours, you hate that wallpaper you take it down, you want to know what the hell is in the weird-shaped cupboard you can't open in the kitchen you find something to pry the fucker open with & get stuck in... my partner will one day have a music studio in the spare room coz we don't want a spare room, we want music... granted it comes with the responsibility for maintaining everything but that will keep me busy, I won't be bored for a while now...

Anyway, I hope some of that struck a chord, & I hope you get your motivation back & have something of your own to feel this way about one day."

I used to talk out loud to myself to break the silence & bring myself out of my own head, sometimes if I'm struggling with something I'll still talk it out aloud, not so easy for negative thoughts to interrupt my inner monologue when it's gone external!

gaming,fr4cujy,t1_fr4axdr,1589884055.0,"If you really don't know the difference between conversation & harassment, nobody on reddit can help you. But I'll try... 

When giving a compliment to anyone, man or woman, it's usually best to go with something they've chosen, it's less likely to be something they're insecure about, people have all kinds of insecurities.

If you want to invite someone somewhere, you'd usually give a bit of context so they know what it is, even for friends, so people can decide if they're interested. I've heard it helps socially anxious people to phrase it not as a question, like ""some of us are going to X on friday, come along if you want,"" so they don't have to answer right away. Ofc not everyone is socially anxious, but in general as long as you're not asking repeatedly or pressuring that's how you ask rather than harassing.

Touching is something a lot of people don't like in the workplace, some people don't like it in general. If someone is in your way you should always use words first, say excuse me, say it louder if they don't react, if you have to I usually go with a tap on the shoulder or upper arm, with fingers not a whole hand, & don't linger, it's the minimum touch that way & I can apologise if the person seems shocked. 

Someone misunderstanding you has always been able to happen any time, in many contexts, it's a bit dishonest to act like people speaking out against harassment has caused any of that."

TwoXChromosomes,fotr2kz,t1_fotgqbj,1588063105.0,Sex is certainly something I wouldn't suggest someone should do when they don't want to.
