That’s really awesome I’m glad you took that route of thinking because kiddos totally pick up on what their parents do or say so now they will be even better off having you as their mom!! Definitely some good advice too when having kids of my own. Thank you for the advice! I feel like sometimes I logically and say “ok this won’t matter in 3 days...1 month..a year etc. so why do I keep on coming back to it and making myself miserable?” But then I continue to make myself miserable about it after I rationally know that it doesn’t matter!
