Ayahuasca,fnoefc4,t3_g2ul2v,1587122361.0,"it sounds like your therapist is speaking from a 3D point of view. You’ve experienced Mother Ayahuasca, a sacred plant. A sacred healing. A religious practice for those who want healing. 
If your therapist experienced Aya, then she/he would know that it is healing. And you’re correct in your question, it does heal you, that’s if you let it.

And by let it, I mean surrender. 

If you have another similar experience, it’s more than likely you’re not allowing ur body, mind and spirit to surrender to the medicine. You basically just learned that, YOU don’t want to see what’s being shown to you, even if it’s about you. Next time she shows you darkness, invite it and ask her “why are you showing me this?” She’ll give you a response. I promise.
Because You specifically said you fought your hardest against the ‘darkness’ that was overcoming your sense of self. But sometimes You gotta let go of complete control over your sense of self... aka the ego. To either be reminded or shown who you really are at your core. Your true sense of self.

I say it this way, not to be harsh, but because it happens, even to the best of us. I just had a similar experience. Tripped me out and it was my 5th ceremony. You may or may not have the same experience next time, it’s all up to you and what your ready and willing to let go of.

Like one of the commentators said, you are the experience. 

Follow your heart next time and not your mind. Trust her and trust in Mother. You won’t get “stuck.”

Sending peace, love, light and clarity to you! 
Safe travels."

Ayahuasca,fjajgst,t3_fby4k2,1583174733.0,"The question you should be asking is “what can I do” not how, 

But you should.. 
1) get a journal. And write in it often. Start with your Aya experiences and then the psychedelic experiences. This will help you with solidifying your experiences so incase you do start to slip up— the journal has it all. And writing, helps your mind/perspective expand. It helps with memory, and releasing emotions that may be holding you back from integrating. Plus, so much more. 
2) do something everyday (THAT YOU LIKE) that helps you feel grounded, alive and focused. 
So like stretching for 10 minutes when u wake up or before going to sleep. Reading a book. Saying a small intent before going into work (the more you speak intents aloud— the more you attract). Lighting a candle in your home (helps you feel calm & relaxed), going for a walk (help you feel alive) etc..
3) repeat the first 2 over and over again

I do the 2 above all the time. And it helps because i am not the same as I was in the past. In the past, I wasn’t lighting candles. I wasn’t walking my dogs regularly. I wasnt sitting still or stretching before starting my day and so on. Neither was I speaking intents before my days at work. 

Little routine things that you do daily, small or big, help you evolve into who you want to be— in your case, someone with less baggage. you’ll soon find yourself releasing and feeling different when you start making minimal changes in your daily routines/lifestyle.
If it’s really hard doing the above— practice moderation."

If you wanted all of the above, you wouldn’t have second guessed it.

I’m 23f, my parents divorced when I was 3... and I lived with my mother ever since. My dad never took care of me and started living off the streets after they divorced. He’s been in and out or jail since. It was rocky and it was scary but my mom always told me “I had to think about someone else... it wasn’t just me to think about anymore.” And for that, I will always thank her. 

It might be hard now because you have history with your husband, and cus he’s the father of your child.. but it’ll be even harder later when your child notices and hears everything. It’ll be harder later when your child is crying because y’all are arguing due to neither one of you being happy.

I barely remember life while my parents were married. So I doubt your 7-month-old will. When your child gets older, they may even thank you. And that’s greatest example you can teach them: to choose yourself first."

But I too was in the same boat as you. My mom raised me as catholic, did the whole communion and shit but I didn’t like church, matter of fact hated going, especially to catholic school on Sundays cus I never learned anything, and thought it was pointless. And still do. when my mom saw that I was interested in reading about Buddhism and Hinduism, she says “you better not think about converting.”
I was 15 years old... like what the fuck? 
I’m 23 now, and two years ago I took my first acid trip.. and will continue to dive into psychedelics. then back in June/July-ish.. I had my first experience with mother ayahuasca. Since then my life has changed. Because I too felt just like you. Trying to fit in this reality, so to speak. And Depression no longer sits with me. Nothing negative sits with me anymore.. and I choose not to let it.
 my mom was very unbelievable and very uncomfortable about this “sacred medicine” cus she’s thinking it’s a drug and cus it goes against everything she’s ever believed in. But when I told her I saw my great-grandmother’s spirit sitting next to me... that’s when she believed me. My great-grandmother died 6 months ago... So my mom says, “wow, you’ve got to kidding me. Atleast I now know where she went.” 

Point of the story is, fuck what ur parents say and think. Yes respect them and love them for who they are but YOU have your life to live. If you think there’s more out there then go find it. Bc there is. If you’re already interested in the medicine, do some research, find a shaman, and think of pure intents before you drink her.
The worst thing you can possibly do now, is to do absolutely nothing.

You can’t fight the fact that you’re here in this fucked up, cruel world. So once you accept that ur here, this is ur reality, you gotta go find the beauty in it before it or you are gone.

Ayahuasca,etz779j,t3_cdwjij,1563327855.0,"I just had my first experience this past Saturday.
and I was nervous too! I was told by my shaman it’s okay to be nervous and not to worry because you don’t know what to expect but definitely let go of any expectations u may have.

Bc what you think you know, is literally not what u know.

Go in with an open mind.
Mother Aya will Show you what you need to be shown.
And as long as your intent is pure and honest then your experience with her will be pure and honest.

also, really follow the dieta. Really train and focus yourself not to eat meat, or have sex.. masturbation is okay but even then you’ll have a better experience if u don’t do it at all because you’ll spend more time purging instead of journeying when the time comes.
Mother Aya moves and removes anything that’s in her way before she takes you on your journey.

I practiced the dieta for a week and I purged twice but I also had an incredible journey. She showed me events from my childhood that I only remembered in pictures. She brought me back to that exact day and I could remember what that day felt and smelt like. 
It was pretty indescribable to say the least.

And when she’s with you, be sure to talk to her. Converse with her. Ask her As many questions as u want. She responds back, not in a new/different voice but in your voice. She talks back as your subconscious, it’s hard to explain but you’ll know the difference when the time comes.

Also the shamans will be singing and playing instruments throughout your whole experience.. when you journey, it usually last 3-6hours at a time.
Some of the songs u make like, or may dislike, the sounds might even irritate the crap out of you or ur ears may be sensitive to it. But the shamans do it for a purpose. It’s to heighten your journey but also to help ground you. 

also in your intent, you can ask mother to be gentle with you since it’s ur first time. 
I would also say “allow me to surrender to you” bc sometimes the journey gets hard and when it does you want to fight it.. but when u fight it.. she gets harder, stronger and more intense. But if you surrender yourself when it gets uncomfortable, you’ll be able to keep moving along.

I hope you journey well,
And your shown what you need to be shown.
Good luck and Safe travels."
