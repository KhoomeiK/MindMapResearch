I guess to purchase medical Marijuana you have to be 18 but I dont see how raising that to 19 will make any significant difference. Also, how can they accommodate for every variable and factor? A study like this is too broad. Do they have underlying issues that cause them to smoke weed at a younger age and then also contribute to the outcome of their life, or is it because of smoking weed their life turned out the way it did? Its impossible to say. Also I see a lot of people say the age should be 25 when your brain is fully developed but Ive never heard of any studies showing that weed has a negative impact on an underdeveloped brain, is this commonly seen as true?"

Of course the answer isn't to reopen but rather for our government to do better, but it seems like thats not going to happen any time soon so I get why people would want to take matters into their own hands.
