Salvia,fikgdr1,t1_fijdf40,1582479843.0,And the thoughts I try to let them go free but my mind always stays on the fact that I’m not visually tripping so I pack more bowls. Which just gets my body to start feeling more and more on lock. I can’t seem to find the amount to smoke to get me actually visually tripping.
Salvia,fikg1nn,t1_fiju2ob,1582479666.0,thank you!! And yes that is what I am being told by peers and friends who have been to salv land.. thank you again for this I’m going to try smokinh it again but it mostly makes me scared and confused but I visually am still in my room and nothing gets weird except for my physical body feeling.
Salvia,fikfukn,t1_fijdf40,1582479560.0,Thank you for replying! And thank you for that answer I did have a suspicion that it could raise my anxiety and paranoia but when I smoke i get the feeling and then it feels like I could eat my young and I start chewing on it 2 minutes after exhaling I’ll be confused and my room will have either changing led lights or a solid pink blue or red led vibe you know? I’ve tried to smoke it then lay in bed but the more I smoke the less my eyes want to even stay open.. I’ll look at things and nothing will have a change I will just start to feel the salvia physically.

First heard this in mr nobody 7 years ago when me and some homies were getting baked and it was a trippy movie, never really gave it much thought. 
Last year Fiji water used this track on one of their  commercials and I almost cried went to look it up once I found and heard it I couldn’t stop crying and listening to it due to how short it actually is. Felt like I was in heaven and god was accepting all the wrongs I’ve done in my life. 
(No I was not high or anything) 
When I  heard this I felt like I was in a place where there was no judgement towards anything or anybody. It is a beautiful song.."
benzodiazepines,fi15otp,t1_fhy22vp,1582051139.0,The taste is so good! Just call me the klonopin monster 😂  *nom nom nom *
benzodiazepines,fi15icw,t1_fhzaq3m,1582051040.0,And I shouldn’t have said sedative as it isn’t one it is an anti depressant but has property’s to help with sleeping and people with anorexia (sorry if I spelled it wrong) but I take it for my depression.
benzodiazepines,fi15des,t1_fhzaq3m,1582050961.0,Nothing like a bar. It will have you HUNGRY! When I say hungry I mean hungry! Fuck stoner munchies mirtazipine munchies hit sooo hard! You will be hit with a little wave of sedatives to help you sleep but I’m on 45 mg and haven’t gotten “high” from it but I have read online at 200 mgs someone was tripping balls and it apparently is not the only story lots of people take it to “trip” but I wouldn’t just because I only take 45 mg it helps me sleep and eat but besides that you won’t black out and prob won’t feel as good and ready as if you took a benzo.. hope this helped!! Haha one love brotha and hope the new script works well for you!:)
benzodiazepines,fhxu7w6,t3_f54xi2,1581962388.0,Always love chewing my meds and swallowing (seroquel&Mirtazipine) but for my kpins I always let em just dissolve on my tounge then I swallow. It tastes like I’m in candy land !! Hahahaha 💪🏻
TripSit,fgti6y6,t1_fgsek5t,1581104833.0,I appreciate it brother! I actually asked my homie who was selling them if the orange juice and lemon tek worked and he told me anything with acid will intensify the Trip.. good thing I have a lemon tree and a bunch of oranges 😁 thank you for the insight hope you have a blessed day! 🔥💪🏻

Anxiety,fgmdfuc,t3_ez7nas,1580922426.0,"This happened to me in my speech class for college every time I had to give my speech’s. I wish I could say I found a solution but I was even off of 2 mg klonopin and 50 mg seroquel (prescribed) and I was still shaking throughout my whole body and trembling, sweating and my voice was shaky. And every blink felt heavier and heavier and I nearly blacked out my first time I gave my speech for this class.. but when I got through it I felt so good and when I finally passed that class and realized that it  was over I had a wave of relief (something I rarely feel) but in this class at least half dropped out because they couldn’t do the speech and the others that were preforming were so anxious! 
I’m saying this because not only do I and everybody on this subreddit relate to what you’ve gone through but even irl peers can relate to what you went through. I’m sorry you had this happen but just know so many people have your back and care about you! And no matter what anybody says, IT WILL GET BETTER BROTHER!! Always know your not alone when dealing with the horror that is anxiety and it’s physical grasp on the entire body I personally deal with it everyday.. 
One love brother 💪🏻💚"

SuorinAir,f6720hf,t3_dqlovu,1572715811.0,"Unfortunately not in my experience I’ve had 5 sourin airs all brand new from a local smoke shop in the span of 6 months it was not me causing the issues it’s simply the sourin air I’ve tried almost 10 times to contact them ab some sort of warranty but just like you stated after they replied with a confirmation sticker I was ghosted by them I was fed up and bought a smok novo and I have to say personally the device itself has lasted over a year, it has its issues but it’s no where near sourin airs issues. Don’t get me wrong I’ve loved airs since they came out but they simply are not good devices when it comes to life spans. Mabye it is just me and others have had great experiences, but with almost all the salt nic devices sourin air has had the shortest life span and I’m one to keep my pods and device clean. Hope you get a reply from them tho! If not and your thinking of buying another I would say the smok novo is a better transition but it’s all personal preference, good luck tho✌🏻"
