ffxiv,fp1cqrs,t1_foy9htl,1588231212.0,I should have done this back during my MUX/MUSH/IRC days. I have lost track of tons of good friends from those days. It's been almost 20 years since I last played on one.. I guess back then I just didn't think about keeping in touch with people.

And there was a period of time where my retainers seemed obsessed with bringing me Chubs so he started joining them, sending them to me via mail.

I also have mail in there from my ex, who was best friends with the previous friend and nearly lost her mind when he died.. she quit the game immediately and never came back. We broke up not long after during her mental breakdown. Lol, I should delete those but some of them are funny."

So, the Devil is more powerful than God, huh?"
