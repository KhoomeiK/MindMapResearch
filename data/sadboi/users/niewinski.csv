“Creativa Coffee District captures the collision between coffee and art in an equilibrium that inspires collaboration and change. The processing facility in the Chiriquí province of Panama serves as a canvas for coffee professionals to create masterpieces that elevate the taste experience.

With the sustainability of future generations in mind, Creativa uses renewable energy during processing and transport to shrink their carbon footprint. The project is made possible by cooperation between the environment and the community. Creativa Coffee District purchases cherries from smallholders in Hornito, Boquete, and Renacimiento coffee areas of Chiriquí and conducts all stages of processing, drying, and export preparation. At Creativa, coffee production is an art form.”"
Coffee,fqu1048,t3_gklra4,1589649924.0,"First time brewing up [Sey out of Brooklyn with their Ethiopia Benti Nenka](https://www.seycoffee.com/products/benti-nenka). I’d rate this roast near perfect. It blows me away every time I brew it. I’m using a 1:17 ratio with a slightly finer grind with a steep time of 4 minutes on a Clever. Their tasting notes are pretty on point with ripe peach dominating the cup but you can taste the melon and star fruit in there. For me the aftertaste is more fruity than vanilla. If you’re looking for a washed, fresh crop Ethiopian coffee this is it."
