Still, clunky at times. Overall opinion, they're actually really good for a mobile port of this type of game where battles like these happen. It's really like armies going at it, and you can change the unit size to small or huge."
totalwar,fg9gdlw,t1_fg990ha,1580638476.0,"The trees are basically tech trees, like you can upgrade the barracks which will allow better soldiers and you can make blacksmiths which will give your weapons better effect, and you can also research non-military trees

The battles can be quite massive, I probably had 3,000 soldiers on the field in one army. On my cellphone. Fighting another army with around the same. 

Doesn't really crawl, because for me it was battle after battle, acted fast to upset the power that the Senate, Brutii and Scipii had. Scipii had the largest military, but I built up, took Rome and dismantled their armies on the Peninsula. They had a lot of captains leading big armies, whereas every big army I had around Rome had a general, most had multiple stars, which affect your generals hit points. And, characters unlock skills as they do their function.

Education, the financial [trade], food production [which also coincides with financial], military, public health buildings all can be upgraded so that you unlock greater effects. 

I think after beating the game, it's more like replenishing my troops, regathering, and moving on more settlements. Rn, I'm increasing the standard of living throughout the Empire, I always made sure to research sewers, Coliseum, temples and stuff thatd make the populace happier and living clean and good. I got imaginative. I won and militarily, economically, strategically defeated my other Roman enemies, however if I wanted, I could conquer what the Brutii have left. I might take a few settlements, but I'm gonna let the Scipii and Brutii have some peace now that I've destroyed the threat they posed."

Go to cool events, poetry open mic's, find something that you're naturally inclined towards, like art or something, and try to meet people through it.

Also, online message boards like this where you can build friends. Online gaming. Even if you can't physically kick it for a bit, at least you'll still be able to relate with other people."

socialskills,f9j09r7,t3_e5ben7,1575351212.0,"No. Everybody has the right to express how they feel. Some people are attracted to females. There's nothing wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with honoring gender fluid and gender. They both exist for a reason. We can't stop people from using words or speaking how they want. Genders are as natural as gender fluid folks. Both can exist in compassion and acceptance.

Please stop ridiculing people because you feel uncomfortable. Please don't try to take away anybodys rights or make them feel bad for expressing themselves in certain ways. There are plenty of women who still identify as women, and plenty of men still attracted to them. Just like how you don't want LGBTQ rights to be taken, can't take away a mans right to love a woman.

I've advocated for LGBTQ rights for a while. I still like to speak about females, women, and honor that part of them even though my awareness is bigger than narrowness.
