antidepressants,fqwwlp8,t1_fqwwavl,1589719813.0,Thank you for your response it‚Äôs calmed me down a bit. I tried googling Naltrexone but it didn‚Äôt help much. It helps hearing it personally
antidepressants,fqwwjk1,t1_fqww9i2,1589719762.0,Thanks! I just took it. Yesterday it took 1.5 hours for me to feel the effects. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs just the first few days that it‚Äôll be like this ü§ûüèº
antidepressants,fqwvity,t1_fqwuqvr,1589718908.0,What is Effexor for? I don‚Äôt think is anything is weird but it‚Äôs left me feeling mad weak. Slightly anxious to take today‚Äôs dose.
antidepressants,fqwvh7c,t1_fqwum88,1589718869.0,Your comment made me smile so thank you.. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why I‚Äôm Naltroxene either like I don‚Äôt drink much or smoke at all (just weed). But I asked my psychiatrist for Bupropian because I want to lose weight since munchies lol. He put me on both together to lose weight and to ‚Äúavoid self harm urges‚Äù though I haven‚Äôt self harmed in years so. As long as the fog and sick won‚Äôt last. I don‚Äôt mind the no appetite as long as it‚Äôs not nausea..

They undressed me on the street and there were so many bees in my clothing and so many dead ones falling - even in my underwear. I‚Äôll never forget the pain though
BipolarSOs,fp1y3p9,t1_fp1wkyl,1588250899.0,He is def still depressed and we‚Äôre still adjusting his meds.. he‚Äôs also in therapy twice a week.
BipolarSOs,fp0klnm,t1_fp0ii19,1588211149.0,Thank you for your response.. I made it clear that I cannot stay if he gets off his meds and it seems that he would rather have the mania than a relationship and a future. He says I get pissed off too fast and he‚Äôs right - I do. But keep frustrating me and putting me in a position to be pissed off and I will be. Why do I love him so much

PanicAttack,fn9rgjm,t1_fn91jgn,1586782667.0,I worked really hard. I didn‚Äôt function from the age of 15-19... I didn‚Äôt leave my house for a whole year it was that bad. My mom didn‚Äôt let me go to therapy or take medication. I did start therapy behind her back but it didn‚Äôt help much. I started writing and that helped a lot.  As soon as I‚Äôd feel it coming I‚Äôd start writing every half thought in my head. Distraction was key. I learnt the warning signs for when it starts and started telling myself that this is a panic attack and that I‚Äôve been through this before and I know that I will be okay and no I‚Äôm not really having a heart attack or nervous breakdown. It didn‚Äôt always work but eventually I got stronger.. I failed at first because I my subconscious started focusing on other things like an eating disorder which I wasn‚Äôt aware had started or gotten so bad until it came into focus and I realized how my mind was trying to distract itself in many wrong ways. It took a lot but eventually I I got stronger than the panic in my head.. recently things have been really stressful though and this has been the worst year of my life tbh so I‚Äôm not so surprised I had a panic attack though I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôll start up again...

BipolarSOs,fmhx5l5,t1_fmhv2fu,1586096527.0,Wowwww that‚Äôs intense.. it must‚Äôve taken a while to get BP1 as the diagnosis because it can be diagnosed as other things first.how are you holding up through this?

We‚Äôve been married for close to 3 years now and it started a year ago. Mostly depression and then a ‚Äúdr‚Äù triggered his mania so bad he was manic and delusional for like 3 months before he finally got a diagnosis. Does vraylar have any side effects?"

BipolarSOs,flkh8ku,t1_flkbzfl,1585240882.0,Okay thank you I appreciate it.. I probably did misunderstand. Or it‚Äôs likely the psychiatrist wanted my husband to think he‚Äôs taking an anti depressant
BipolarSOs,flk90ul,t1_flk8k6v,1585236376.0,Abilify didn‚Äôt seem to do anything either. How long has he been diagnosed? How bad is it? I‚Äôm so new to this whole thing and my life has been turned upside down this year..
