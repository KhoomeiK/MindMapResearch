antidepressants,fqwwlp8,t1_fqwwavl,1589719813.0,Thank you for your response it’s calmed me down a bit. I tried googling Naltrexone but it didn’t help much. It helps hearing it personally
antidepressants,fqwwjk1,t1_fqww9i2,1589719762.0,Thanks! I just took it. Yesterday it took 1.5 hours for me to feel the effects. Fingers crossed it’s just the first few days that it’ll be like this 🤞🏼
antidepressants,fqwvity,t1_fqwuqvr,1589718908.0,What is Effexor for? I don’t think is anything is weird but it’s left me feeling mad weak. Slightly anxious to take today’s dose.
antidepressants,fqwvh7c,t1_fqwum88,1589718869.0,Your comment made me smile so thank you.. I’m not exactly sure why I’m Naltroxene either like I don’t drink much or smoke at all (just weed). But I asked my psychiatrist for Bupropian because I want to lose weight since munchies lol. He put me on both together to lose weight and to “avoid self harm urges” though I haven’t self harmed in years so. As long as the fog and sick won’t last. I don’t mind the no appetite as long as it’s not nausea..

They undressed me on the street and there were so many bees in my clothing and so many dead ones falling - even in my underwear. I’ll never forget the pain though
BipolarSOs,fp1y3p9,t1_fp1wkyl,1588250899.0,He is def still depressed and we’re still adjusting his meds.. he’s also in therapy twice a week.
BipolarSOs,fp0klnm,t1_fp0ii19,1588211149.0,Thank you for your response.. I made it clear that I cannot stay if he gets off his meds and it seems that he would rather have the mania than a relationship and a future. He says I get pissed off too fast and he’s right - I do. But keep frustrating me and putting me in a position to be pissed off and I will be. Why do I love him so much

PanicAttack,fn9rgjm,t1_fn91jgn,1586782667.0,I worked really hard. I didn’t function from the age of 15-19... I didn’t leave my house for a whole year it was that bad. My mom didn’t let me go to therapy or take medication. I did start therapy behind her back but it didn’t help much. I started writing and that helped a lot.  As soon as I’d feel it coming I’d start writing every half thought in my head. Distraction was key. I learnt the warning signs for when it starts and started telling myself that this is a panic attack and that I’ve been through this before and I know that I will be okay and no I’m not really having a heart attack or nervous breakdown. It didn’t always work but eventually I got stronger.. I failed at first because I my subconscious started focusing on other things like an eating disorder which I wasn’t aware had started or gotten so bad until it came into focus and I realized how my mind was trying to distract itself in many wrong ways. It took a lot but eventually I I got stronger than the panic in my head.. recently things have been really stressful though and this has been the worst year of my life tbh so I’m not so surprised I had a panic attack though I’m terrified it’ll start up again...

BipolarSOs,fmhx5l5,t1_fmhv2fu,1586096527.0,Wowwww that’s intense.. it must’ve taken a while to get BP1 as the diagnosis because it can be diagnosed as other things first.how are you holding up through this? What’s making you stay? Sorry if that’s intrusive.. I’m just trying to understand my own reasoning for staying.
BipolarSOs,fmhtusf,t1_fmhqwbp,1586093346.0,"Oh wow.. when did you start noticing it?
We’ve been married for close to 3 years now and it started a year ago. Mostly depression and then a “dr” triggered his mania so bad he was manic and delusional for like 3 months before he finally got a diagnosis. Does vraylar have any side effects?"
BipolarSOs,fmhq02z,t1_fmh972q,1586089937.0,I was wondering this too.. my husband has BP1 and some things she mentioned fit with the things my husband has been doing. I’m wondering if Vraylar can work..

BipolarSOs,flkh8ku,t1_flkbzfl,1585240882.0,Okay thank you I appreciate it.. I probably did misunderstand. Or it’s likely the psychiatrist wanted my husband to think he’s taking an anti depressant
BipolarSOs,flk90ul,t1_flk8k6v,1585236376.0,Abilify didn’t seem to do anything either. How long has he been diagnosed? How bad is it? I’m so new to this whole thing and my life has been turned upside down this year..
BipolarSOs,flk8cm1,t1_flk71gw,1585235993.0,He does know... maybe it isn’t an anti depressant? I’m new to this. He’s on abilify and he’s starting him on lamictal.
BipolarSOs,flk6ukp,t1_flk69zr,1585235125.0,He’s starting today! It’s not very clear I guess.. we had a call with his psychiatrist yesterday and he’s starting him on it
