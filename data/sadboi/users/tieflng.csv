feemagers,f0e6dt7,t3_d4e84h,1568563789.0,"god i relate to this so much.

when i was 10, i was pulled out of public school and put into homeschool. i lost every friend i had and haven’t had any irl friends in 5 years. (that’s not me exaggerating, i legitimately haven’t had friends in 5 years. my social interaction has been group therapy and a mental hospital when i was 13.) i tried going back to public school last year but i struggle with a plethora of mental health issues and i couldn’t handle it.

on top of the mental health issues, i grew up in an unstable, broken home. long story short: i had to be really strong from a young age. i had to grow up fast. i can’t be vulnerable with any of my family because of the things that happened, even to the ones that care about me. i push people away and act like an asshole.

i’m tired of being strong. i’m tired of taking care of people. i’m tired of having walls up 24/7. i’m tired and while i know people can’t cure me i desperately want to be loved by somebody."

goth,ezk7d58,t3_d11vdm,1567956141.0,"i’m 15 myself and my interest in goth started when i was 12. granted, when i was 12 i *hated* the music, it did grow on me.

goth is a music based subculture so start off with the music. 

the bare minimum staples to start off with (i think most people would agree on) are:

- bauhaus
- sisters of mercy
- christian death
- the cure
- siouxsie and the banshees
- joy division
- alien sex fiend

out of those, i would figure out which ones you like and don’t like. go from there and explore bands and new genres. there’s so much goth music out there which is why it’s disappointing to see people hype up the same few artists.

also, in the beginning i felt like i *had* to like certain artists which isn’t true. for example, a lot of people love them but i really don’t like london after midnight. make sure to go with what you like, not what the majority likes!!

if you end up finding and liking coldwave check out hoffen!! his song “calisto” is really good and he seems to be a relatively small artist."

in jackie and wilson, i thought it was “we’ll steal A lexus”, not “her lexus”. i also thought that it was “we tried the world good god it wasn’t for us.”

edit: alright, i went to check the lyric book in the first album and I actually wasn’t wrong about it being “world”. in conclusion; fuck google. the album has been out long enough for it to be changed."
