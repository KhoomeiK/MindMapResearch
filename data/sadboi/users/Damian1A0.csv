Comes to show that we shouldn’t give up hope on the problems and especially not the small ones. Thank you so much for posting this I’m so glad I was able to witness this. It was very much needed.

And it’s scary cause you can’t force someone to love you all you can really do is try your best. Man I feel this post and I’m scared on another level. She’s super special to me and I just want to give her everything and all I want in return is undeniable love and love that is not hidden but expressed. I want to show her off and her to me and us to be happy together.

Sorry I ranted in your post."
