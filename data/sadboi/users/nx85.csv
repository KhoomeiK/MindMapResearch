I broke it off after the first date, it was an instant turn off for me. He also told me a story during the date that I found distressing, to say the least.

He reached out months later saying he wanted another chance, asking why I changed my mind about seeing him. I mentioned the clothing stuff turning me off, then he called me shallow and left me alone before reaching out again months later and doing the exact same thing."

Another one that stands out was a guy who had a photo of him in a nice dress shirt at a function, and a photo of him fishing in loose t-shirt and sweats. Typical stuff. Our first date was at a fancy restaurant. Well, I'm sure you know where this is going lol. He showed up in a t-shirt and sweats, big work boots. And no, he didn't just come from work!
