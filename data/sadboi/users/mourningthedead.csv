I need to purchase some lighting equipment but on a budget. I find 3 piece lighting kits on amazon for around $200 (speaking about the fovitech 3 piece kit)

My question is are those cheap lighting kits worth it for someone like myself who is new to photography or  is it basically throwing money in the garbage?"

Also, I noticed NCLEX pass rates for them is 92% out of 1288 students, so I don’t doubt they have a lot of students... but this also makes me wonder, how is it everyone says don’t go to this school yet, they have such a high number of students and pass rates?"
nursing,f3c583v,t1_f3c2uzr,1570819940.0,That’s not so bad. I’m gonna look at some colleges and just aim high.
nursing,f3bzxdc,t1_f3bzdns,1570818118.0,Ok that makes sense. I’m cool with not getting a job the day after graduating but if it’s like a year I’m gonna be worried
nursing,f3bx9sm,t1_f3bx13p,1570817229.0,Ha! Not me... what for profit school is fairly priced and gives you a legitimate education?

nursing,f3bu7nl,t1_f3brqtt,1570816218.0,"Thank you. This is what I needed to hear. I lean towards nursing and even more so because of what you stated. So, regardless the school I go to, it’s more likely the individual that loses the job themself. The RT issue i just so happen to read yesterday. Some say they just train nurses to handle RT roles in which case eventually fades them out. So, if I did decided on a for profit college would you be able to give me any of your preferred ones. I heard west coast univ. has insanely high rates. Like higher than all the others."
nursing,f3bpl4a,t1_f3bn0w2,1570814446.0,"That’s crazy! I’d imagine them having jobs considering all the nursing jobs listed. When I look for RRT jobs, I don’t find many and the ones I do find want experience. It’s like I’m damned either way. Unless I move, which I don’t want to."
nursing,f3bmp69,t1_f3bmed8,1570813206.0,That’s a good point! I’m making a career change so I don’t want to waste time. I originally thought going the RRT route but nursing seems like id have way more options should I want to be in a specific area of patient care.
nursing,f3bluty,t1_f3blgxa,1570812841.0,I’m thinking the same... the debt isn’t worth it. I’ve also looked into respiratory therapy at a career college which is less debt but still high nonetheless. My purpose for attending is career change. I’m currently 38 yrs old so I’m not sure if that would make the difference as far as going to a career college
nursing,f3bkorx,t1_f3bkenw,1570812345.0,"Yea that seems to be the case... if it’s worth it, I’d possibly go to one but again, I read lots of horror stories. Some include students getting kicked out for “nothing” as they put it."

respiratorytherapy,f385aa4,t1_f384egr,1570733579.0,So perhaps leaning towards nursing may be a better option as far as all around patient care (obviously) and money. Is it safe to assume the schooling is much more intense to obtain a BSN? I know these questions may sound “dumb” but I’m trying to make the best possible choice as well as be the best at what I decide to do.

I think it’s because I know freaking out and spinning in a circle doing a backwards rain dance probably won’t help anyone and in fact,  make it worse. I have 3 kids and I can tell you, there have been occasions where if I wasn’t calm, it could’ve cost their life or further injury. Things like this make me want to be in the medical field.

respiratorytherapy,f35j7dw,t1_f35iorz,1570679253.0,"Thanks. I see other jobs paying more money but aren’t for me. I just imagine me be responsible for a person living or dying and I really am confident once I am trained to make those decisions, I will do just that. Nurses make more where I live but again, not for me. I’ve done jobs I hate and made a lot of money. I swore I’d never sell my soul for another paycheck ever again. So, if helping people allows me to want to continue to grow, then that’s what I’ll do. Of course we all need money but, I want to do something rewarding. They can keep the extra 15k a year... I’ll be alright. The more advice I get on here the more I personally feel RT is the right choice."

I am open to nursing but RT just seems like something I could actually do. I’m meeting with the school next week so I’ll see what they have to say. For all I know, they’ll steer me in a different direction. If they do, hopefully it’s for the better."
respiratorytherapy,f350hgy,t1_f34yc9r,1570665324.0,"Thought about nursing but it seems like everyone does that and might be over saturated. Plus, the idea of inserting a catheter brings me to my knees. I’m good with blood and everything else but that... oof 😖"
