As for ear fit, that can be hard--one of my ears is also smaller. Maybe you can find a cheap pair that fits better than the Beats. 

I also tried wearing full earmuff style ear protection over my headphones but that was just too uncomfortable and didn't even improve isolation that much. Find it's better to just sleep on my side with a pillow on my head.

PS: the most effective earplugs I've used are Pura-Fit ones made by Moldex. They are longer and denser but still soft.

- Don't look at my phone, or the time, or anything else.
- If I need to piss, I'll put a shirt on my head, and grope my way to the bathroom in the dark.
- Hold on in my mind to whatever dream I was just having 
(replay it and try to fall back into the dream/sleep state). This seems to work best for me.
- If my mind starts racing, I have music or sleep podcasts cued up the evening before, and I put them on asap without browsing anything else on my phone."

insomnia,ezi848v,t3_d16jad,1567922770.0,"If small noises waking you up is a major part of the problem, let me C&P my reply to another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/d0yhmj/anything_wakes_me_up/):

Two solutions would be (A) wear ear plugs, or (B) get a white noise source in your room.

You could even combine them. For instance, recently, there has been heavy construction in my building starting every day at 8 (jack-hammering, hammering, etc.) that reverberates through the whole structure. It's so noisy that even ear plugs don't block out the sound. However, I've discovered that if I wear in-ear ear buds and play low-frequency white noise ([this track is good](https://soundcloud.com/alexandermimran/low-frequency-white-noise-loud)) at med volume, it totally drowns out the sounds of the construction. It sounds a bit like the whoosh/rumble you hear on an airplane, so I can still fall asleep to it. 

If you prefer earplugs, my experience is that [these Moldex ones](https://www.amazon.com/Moldex-Pura-Fit-Tapered-Polyurethane-Uncorded/dp/B000BYAP7I) block out the most sound, more than 3M, as they are longer and denser.

If you absolutely can't tolerate sleeping with anything in your ears, then you could also get a loud fan or other white noise source (or just play the noise over speakers with decent bass).

Hope that helps."
