I don't really know if this information is useful, or helpful in anyway. There's also no real way to verify anything as it's been lost to time, but I'd like to get it off my chest. I'll keep things as brief as I can remember, since I've forgotten a lot since then, and don't want to say anything untrue.

I had a lot of problems when I was younger, and was almost a victim of William Francis. I was around 16 at the time (around 2005ish), and frequented suicide news groups and chatrooms, trying to determine the best way to kill myself. That's when I met ""Li Dao"".

I had a lot of self-esteem issues, overweight, and found most of my social life was online, since I wasn't very popular in school. It was amazing to actually meet another person who was around my age, who held similar views to me, and to be honest, the ""female"" attention was exciting. We exchanged messages on over a dozen separate occasions. 

We had entered a suicide pact, ""she"" detailed ""her"" plan to me and sent me several links and talked me through how to do everything to ensure success. I won't go into specifics but needless to say I was unsuccessful, thankfully, but I had never heard from ""her"" again. I had assumed ""she"" succeeded, and carried that with me for a long time.

By chance some years later, I decided to try to find some sort of obituary or article, and it quickly led me to the wikipedia page given to him and articles about his victims. I had no idea there were people like that, and to be honest a lot of dark thoughts went through my head about what I wanted to do to him. I decided however that scum like him aren't worth the effort, and there's no sense to try to ruin my life a second time.

After the clip ended, he said ""I don't know what it's like to kill a human being, because they forfeited their humanity when they decided to act like an animal. I've only ever put down animals.""

When we were doing drills he would have us point our weapons toward Mecca, and another favorite quote of mine was ""Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.""

The worst is underfeeding over a long period of time. Just enough food to keep your heart beating, but not enough to replace the lost calories. I tend to start having minor hallucinations around week 2, and refeeding takes me a few days to get back to normal. You can go a lot farther than you think with little or no food.

Cold sucks. Wet sucks. You can easily become hypothermic in 60 degree weather when you're wet, let alone 35 degrees. That must have been miserable.

*tale as old as time.*"

7daystodie,fdn0maa,t1_fdmbw9h,1578573572.0,"IMO turning up the xp is actually sliding the difficulty up. Yes, you get more levels, but to balance that out your gamestage increases, resulting in more zombies that are higher level and harder horde nights. The offset is you have less time to prepare for those harder hordes, unless you also increase the amount of time you have in a day.

The effects go down during late game though, as the effects of the gamestage plateau."

JustBootThings,fbx2pqc,t3_eemtrg,1577166995.0,If you're seriously not getting enough sleep you need to be disciplined about it. If you time your REM cycles you can function and be good on very little sleep. I use [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/) to find out when to wake up and go to bed. Sometimes it's worth staying up a little later.

depression,fbg303x,t3_ec68tn,1576831775.0,"Recently had a significant anniversary pass. Decided to type ""Denial"" in the search and found your post, sorry no one replied but if it's any consolation you're not alone.

I could have written this post myself, sans the foster care, my mom died when I was young. I was diagnosed in my teens but I've been pretty much in denial my entire life. Weed got me out of drinking, as far as substances go, I think it's a pretty decent one.

I think it's common for people to front and say everything is going great, when really it's not, and that leads to a sort of confirmation bias that everyone is happy when really the truth is a lot sadder than we think. 

This time of year sucks for me too. I hope you can find something to at least keep you busy until it passes."
