It is unfinished and has less to it than a typical JB game because it was one of the very last games to be in production in party pack 5 and did not have a lot of time to be realized.

Evidence shows that there was going to be multiple bosses, an audience vote feature allowing it to still be stream friendly (assuming for enemies or power-ups to be dropped during a game)

Even the fact that this game has little going for it, it will always be a must play amongst my friends. (Assuming we aren't in a call, but I'm thinking about doing so on Mixer since it has really instantaneous timing.)

I enjoy the screw system though. It can let EVERYONE have some chaos in fun ways even if those ways aren‚Äôt exactly that tough to get around. The screw that makes the answers go all over the place is the only genuinely effective screw. (Called screensaver.)

FS‚Äôs episodes too are great, but they are few and far in between coming in at pretty much random chance. You can‚Äôt choose them either so the odds of having one with a full party is unbelievably low.
