Advice,fe9t1a4,t1_fe9jkml,1578941234.0,"Wow, thank you soooo much for that. It's sad how much I can relate. I've tried explaining her how much he hurts me but she keeps getting VERY offended and makes these huuuge fights at home which make our family's lives harder and my bro and dad are ultimately always mad at me for triggering her. Even when I don't, EVERYTHING triggers her. And she keeps mentioning that she's a great mom cuz she feeds me? Tf? Isn't that the most basic thing you can do for your child. That doesn't make you a good parent.

Most of the times I cry or feel so unloved, unworthy, and suicidal is because of her. And I feel super sad because ik she's not doing it wantedly either, it's because she's sick mentally. I feel so guilty for wanting to just escape far far away from home. I honestly stay as much as I can at college but she goes hysterical when I come home late and makes me feel even more guilty for making her worried. I think the best I can do is by just shutting the fuck up, not trigger her, and try to be as civil as possible. But fuck it if she doesn't wish I didn't exist. I don't think a lot of people should have had kids.

I'm so so sorry you had to go through all that. I'm hoping you're doing better now in her absence atleast. How're you doing now? Do you go to therapy?"
