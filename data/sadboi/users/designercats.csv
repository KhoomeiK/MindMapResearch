Consider yourself absolutely blessed! 

The past couple of weeks I’ve been seeing synchronicities like CRAZY and look up the meaning of angel numbers a couple of dozen times a day. Each time, it’s a reassuring or guiding message for what I’m going through at that moment. It’s incredible. I love Source and our guides so much, they never leave us alone and always want the best. 🥺 

Seconding the other commenter who said to look up the meanings on Joanne Sacred Scribe’s blog. She has the meanings for all the numbers you’re seeing. I keep her blog open on my phone and look up the number anytime I see one and feel the urge :) It’s changing my life and guiding me on my true path and mission in this lifetime."

Of course, if your mental illness is from a chemical imbalance definitely keep taking medicines (preferably natural as possible if possible) until your soul is healed enough to remove them from your life. I am going through a rapid spiritual awakening while dealing with depression and anxiety, and I am still taking my medication as I don’t feel 100% balanced just yet.
