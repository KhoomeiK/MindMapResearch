MaladaptiveDreaming,fp2s35p,t1_fp2mbbv,1588266955.0,"wow, first of all i want to start of by saying thank you so much for all this advice. it’s really nice to know that there’s someone out there who can relate to how i’m feeling and can also give me some tips.

i think i should’ve mentioned that i have been diagnosed with bipolar 2, meaning that i go through quite intense depressive episodes. during those episodes and depressive moods my daydreaming increases tenfolds, meaning that my bipolar must have something to do with it.

with the caged animal thing, i’m not sure that would bode too well for me lol. i’m a bit of an animal lover and i think seeing them in such a state would just kickstart my anxiety .

i was also considering meditation, to help break down my thoughts and help me relax. but like you, i’m still a bit skeptical as to whether this would actually work or not. 

and congratulating myself after focusing on schoolwork is such a great thing to do. i’m totally gonna try that out and hopefully it’ll make me have a much more positive approach to shortening the daydreaming . 

again thank you so much for all this advice, i’m so grateful that there’s someone like you on this sub to help me and i’m sure you’ve helped others too. 
thank you <3"
