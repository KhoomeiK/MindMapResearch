I've found as I've spoken to many people about this that many don't want to admit this because they then have to admit to a loss of self control. They believe that if they make the right decisions, and that they make the right moral decisions, that eventually they will be successful. As you know this just isn't so. One can make all the right choices and still end up in poverty or worse in life. The far right in this country as well has made being in poverty a moral failing as well, as this doesn't just condemn the poor to a deserved fate, but means they themselves must be good, upstanding people that deserve their success. These people often point to a willingness to do hard work, have perseverance, a strong will, and the smarts to apply it all.

If a church engages in dangerous practices that infringe on the rights of others it is the government's duty to step in. If the state cannot meet the burden of proof that the church is endangering the public by it's actions, then I'll be on your side of the argument. There has to be standing.

In addition, your idea of meeting at a later date to see how this shakes out in the court system is not a proper arbiter of what is right in these situations. Despite the amendment, churches have and do posess rights above and beyond the rights of other citizens and secular groups. That isn't neutrality, that is special privilege. This exists in the court system as well, and when churches are asked to play on the same level playing field as everyone else, they perceive neutrality as persecution, and this is precisely what is happening here. They're petulant spoiled children stomping their foot because they are now expected to show the same level of responsibility as everyone else. 

Churches don't pay taxes. Supposedly for the good they do in their communities. Yet secular charities (503c orgs) have to account for that money. They also receive tax relief, but they are subject to audit at any time to verify where the money is going. Churches don't have to do this. This is why faith healers get way with their various schemes - because of special exceptions in the law concerning religion. This is how Catholics have amassed incredible wealth, and frankly, how the organization hasn't been disbanded and brought to justice. Name one secular organization that could have gotten away with this child rape mess. In most states, church run daycares are EXEMPT from state safety inspections? Why? Because they're trustworthy? Hardly. More children have died under the care of church day cares (that have few regulations) than secular ones. If that's not privilege, I don't know what is.

Likewise, their Protestant counterparts also receive this free and clear tax relief, on the predicate of not being allowed to endorse political candidates - yet they do this with impunity, they even have a pastors organization that exists to precisely do just such a thing. I say tax the churches. If they wish to remain tax free for the good of the community, fine, but they must be subject to audit by a neutral third party. If offered this choice, how many churches would avail themselves of the financial records do you think?

Of course any time there's a natural disasters or unforseen circumstance there the churches stand, hands out for government funds. This is direct support of religion, and since you're such a fan of the constitution, you should know that's a no-no. 

In short you want equality for churches? So do I. Real equality, not special privilege."

We have a constitution, but we curtail these rights both voluntarily and by force of law all the time. Another often used example is free speech.

TrueAtheism,fptqpb3,t3_gf44pe,1588896342.0,"I'll take a stab at it. 

In the West, for some time now, the church has had to contend with the enlightenment and the ideals forged in the enlightenment. This was a massive 2 century long intellectual movement that produced really verifiable results. The church has been forced to adapt to this. It had to contend with some very potent arguments and ideas, and frankly, it often lost. 

Since then it's a church in competition with science, a verifiable, predictive method of high accuracy. So, in some ways it got better. If you can't impress them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit, so to speak. So the church has better arguments than it used to. They may not be right, but they sound better to the average layman. The church has also had to contend with democracy, and share it's authority with the ideas of freedom of expression and speech and religion. In short, with a government of the people, not a monarch or sultan of the same religion, and thus subject to it.

Islam has had no such reformation. It hasn't had to share power. It hasn't had serious philosophical challenge to it's authority in most of the time it's been around.

Ever argue theology with a Muslim? Often, one will notice from the true believing average follower all the way up to Imams or other Islamic authority, their arguments are really poor. That's what comes from having no one challenge your arguments or epistemology in any serious way for 1600 years.

As I got older I bought into that narrative for a time, but after awhile I realized my observations were not matching the rhetoric. I went from Republican to Independent to Democrat and back to Independent. I participated in various political forums and debates, and I was quickly disabused of my notions, hance my move in political parties.

As of late, especially the last few years, I've frankly found myself disgusted with my own country. I want to be a patriot. I want to be proud of my country, but frankly, I agree, we're one of the worst of the Western nations. It's not just Trump, but that roughly 35% of people that support him no matter what. That many people completely on the wrong side of every single political question - and history is very disheartening.

This country is set up for the rich. It's a socialist economy for sure - again for the wealthy. They get to reap the Independent profits and then socialize the losses. They have their own justice system, while we as regular people are held to a much higher standard, even while we're told how we're stupid and lazy.

Put simply, the money HAS to come out of politics or nothing will change. As long as politicians are beholden to wealthy corporate interests instead of the people, we cannot expect any better.

TrueAtheism,fpd8x6p,t3_gcotbc,1588522248.0,"I think it's the motive and how one can draw a straight line from the ideology to the behavior.

Religion is easy in this regard. It's easy enough in many conflicts both past and contemporary to show how the religion is the causal factor in a conflict. It usually isn't the ONLY factor, but an overriding one. An easy example here is the crusades, or the Hindu/Muslim problem in India. The line is easy to draw here from the religious beliefs to the bad actions.

Rarely does this exists in a secular context. Usually, with examples like Mussolini or others, religion isn't being stamped out for the cause of atheism, whatever that may be, it's opposed because religion is seen as a threat to the state's control and power. Members of such religions are more likely to obey religious figures instead of the absolute power of the state. Thus, religion isn't being oppressed because ""there is no God"". It's being oppressed as opposition to rule.

Some supposedly secular states are really just large cults, and oppress religion for like reasons. North Korea for example, or the often trotted out Pol Pot.

I'm unaware of any state that persecuted  religion in order to enforce a positive belief that there is no God. Maybe someone else is, who knows?"

Look at the amount of conspiracy theories present at these functions. These people are tools, in the truest sense of the word. They are used by the wealthy donor class that quite simply don't mind sacrificing these rubes in order to further their own agenda. Most of these functions are traceable to Koch brother money or Devos funding. 

Some of these leaders are already testing positive for covind-19. Will these wealthy donors pay for their care and upkeep. Of course not."

Set for WiFi only, I never had an issue, even with episodes 3 -4 hours in length. Maybe the phone is set too aggressively to jump from wifi to cellular and it's doing so mid-download?"

Oneplus5T,for6tj2,t1_for5dlb,1588007155.0,"As I put in the post above, it went pretty flawlessly. I did end up doing again and wiping data beforehand and it resulted in a smoother experience afterward. I've seen a variety of issues on the forums, but I've only had one, and that's that I cannot get any 3rd party SMS app to work, and so I'm stuck on the stock SMS app. Otherwise no real issues. Battery life seems a bit worse so far, but not dramatically, which I expect from a first beta anyway. The animations and new features are nice, and notifications seem fine, although different apps can have somewhat different color notifications, so if you're looking for black only, it's a no go. All system apps seem the appropriate black though."
TheMindIlluminated,foqqqz4,t1_foplo90,1587999104.0,Thanks. I have insight timer. I'll try the other are well!
Oneplus5T,fooofsq,t1_foonqeq,1587943091.0,"So far I haven't noticed color inconsistencies. I have noticed that some apps may change the color of the notification, however. For example, my Poweramp music app notification changes color to match the album art of the music I'm listening to. There may have been an app or two that was grey, I'll keep an eye out.

P.S. It might also help to turn off and on the customizable options like tone, color, and so on...

TheMindIlluminated,fooo39g,t3_g8g282,1587942885.0,"Approximately a year ago I took up meditation precisely to help my relationship with my SO. She has Borderline Personality Disorder, and she can be a real challenge to get along with. We have two children together, and so I took up meditation to help ME with my emotional control.

Dealing with someone with BPD can cause a lot of anger and bitterness, as well as a slew of other emotions. I wanted to moderate my reaction to her. I need a calm head and to control my own tendency to explode. I have a decent amount of patience, but once it's exhausted I can explode.

Merely being more aware as the anger arises in the body, and knowing that it's anger - a feeling that will pass, and not to judge myself for feeling that way; gaining the ability to watch the anger approach, go by, and move on is very helpful to me. I wish I could say I don't lose it anymore. I do. But I do less, and my anger is of shorter duration. Meditation is also helpful in being less judgemental, and realizing that due to her illness, she's no more to blame than than someone with a physical handicap is to blame for their struggles.

This is exceptionally helpful right now. Due to social distancing, we're all stuck in our little apartment together, and frankly, this has worsened her condition considerably. If I don't hold it together, no one else will.

I'm always on the lookout for more free guided meditation dealing with anger, non-judgement, emotional control, etc. Feel free to leave me any suggestions if you have any. Thanks for your help, and thanks for all the tips I've received over time on this sub."
Oneplus5T,foo4nv7,t3_g8ickv,1587932425.0,"OK. I downloaded from the link, followed the pretty standard directions and the install went perfectly.  No indication of battery life for awhile yet, but scrolling is smooth and everything seems to be running fine.

I use Nova launcher, and I got a warning that Android 10 gestures wouldn't work with third party launches,but so far it seems to be working OK.../shrug  The gestures did change slightly, which will take a bit getting used to, but like I said, working OK. Strangely, Gboard seems to work better than ever now.

There's new customization options, which is nice. I'll report more after I test it for a bit, but install went great. I ran Oreo
 public betas until those stopped, and then went back to
 stable months ago before I tried this update. Give it a spin of you like.
