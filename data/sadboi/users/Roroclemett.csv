GetMotivated,fgerurx,t1_fgen9gc,1580707817.0,"So true. When you can’t get out of bed except to go to the bathroom, reluctantly, cleaning your kitchen is the furthest thing from reality. When you can’t bring yourself to even brush your teeth, cleaning the kitchen is a joke."
bestoflegaladvice,fg7n0sk,t1_fg7e03k,1580596476.0,You were very smart to put the dog down. I was in a similar situation but instead of euthanizing the dog I kept him for 12 years till he died of natural causes. Twelve years that progressively lowered the quality of my life to the point that I would pull up to my house after work and just sit in my car for a while filled with dread thinking about walking in the door. I guess I could never bring myself to euthanize because he wasn’t aggressive but his behavior problems and anxiety were unbearable for him and my family. I felt so bad for him but in retrospect he was so miserable he would of been better off being put to sleep. I won’t bore you with the details but his behavior was awful and we tried EVERYTHING to help and nothing made a shred of difference. If I could go back in time I would not think twice about euthanizing and screw everyone who would of judged.
depression,fex36z2,t3_eqs4h8,1579423549.0,"With luck life may get better or it may be the way you and I inexperience it: a case of painful, exhausting diminishing returns. This is the way I look at it :
People say all the time that life is short so grab it by the balls or whatever, enjoy every moment blah blah. I look at it in the context of the pain I am in and the feeling that it’s just not worth it will be gone shortly because, in fact, life is short. The pain and drudgery will end eventually and it’s just not worth putting the people I love, and who love me, in additional pain when life is hard enough.
Life is short if you are the kind of person who can experience joy but it’s also short for those of us who just want it to be over."

insaneparents,fbgnz8p,t1_fbf4jmu,1576854509.0,"The other issue is minors in this unfortunate situation are concerned about how their attitude toward the dick step parent is going to impact their relationship with their biological parent. It’s not as simple as just making a decision to set boundaries and not take any shit. Awful, selfish step parents are really the worst, I am so glad that woman on Facebook who removed her step kid from family photos was blasted all over the place and exposed for being a horrible person / sociopath. More of them need to be publicly shamed."
AmItheAsshole,f9f0sxc,t1_f9do1ug,1575256595.0,"Do not agree. Your reaction was not proportionate to the actions of your sil and the kids. It
Was inconsiderate of them for sure but it was not the crime of the century and you need to get a life and deal with your control issues. It’s fairly normal when you have kids over to your
house that they manage to fuck something up. You acted like it was a declaration of war. 
Don’t mean to be rude but you are the one that asked if you were the asshole or not. You solicited input. I also do not believe a person who would so rudely refer to your property as ugly ass fabric would then go to the trouble of buying fabric
to attempt to replace it. This is either a fake or a gross exaggeration."
AskReddit,f3t3bui,t1_f3ske1s,1571116957.0,"This is the worst part of being a parent of an adult child with a severe addiction. You mention how glad you are that your parents supported you through it and there is a post on here from a person in recovery who says it was his mom cutting off contact with him that helped him hit rock bottom and get sober. It is an impossible choice. You either abandon your child in need, or let yourself be taken down emotionally, physically, financially etc. exist in a state of suicidal idealization. 
what the hell is the answer for parents? I am so glad you made it through ok but this situation is a non stop hell scape for parents.

You have done something incredible, six months is huge! the daily pain and anguish you have been through to reach this goal must have been unreal. I know you have a long road ahead but you have already reclaimed your life. It gives hope to people struggling with heroin addiction and to those of us who love someone who is going through it.Thanks for making my day!"
