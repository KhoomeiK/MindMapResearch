Let's all belittle and laugh at the most vulnerable in our society! After all that Is the American way!"

Over the last few years I have discovered that there is so much help out there including financial help for people in my situation. Granted I live in Austria where socialism has dominated since 1945. Look into subsidies and support. My flat is payed by the government and I get a monthly allowance, love this country. Getting myself organised and getting what I deserve has taken the burden off my mother and has made our relationship worlds better. Don't be ashamed bro. We deserve a little help. 

Wish you all the best bro."

Don't get trapped into consciously following one thought, which can feel quite good, just let them pass by like strangers on the sidewalk.

You will find that you have good qualities that are a lot better than other people. Don't compare your weeknesses to others, focus on what you like about yourself and you will begin to see how bad a lot of people are at that thing.


Best of luck bro. 

Positive affirmations (Youtube) are really powerful.

PS. Im on mood stabilisers and anti depressants so that helps a lot aswell. :)"

lgbt,ev3w2cp,t1_ev378or,1564203267.0,"Life is about being true to yourself and telling everyone to go fuck themselves.  This is the only path to salvation. 

Often ""family"" can be the biggest demons in our lives, talking from experience here, and no one will ever hurt us as deeply as they do. Be true to your SELF. Otherwise you will never even have a chance at happiness. Give yourself a chance. That's the least you can do.

You could die at any moment, that's the reality of this situation we are in. Ask yourself if you would be happy to die today never having given yourself a chance.

Maybe even ask yourself if you would be happy to die today never having spent even one day as a girl. 


Think about it.

Do yoga and meditate and the answers will come from within yourself.
