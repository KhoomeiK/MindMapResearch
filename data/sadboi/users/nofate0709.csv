Say, you have container A running Kazzing/tcpdump, B and C are other containers.  tcpdump, by logic, A is capable of capturing A <-->B, A <-->C, but how it could capture B <---> C?    I have not try this out yet, but if this is true, then the only reason for this to be possible is that all A,B,C are communicating on a hub-like network (not router).

docker,fqks1zp,t3_gjbjy1,1589434692.0,"Swarm mode in docker allows you to connect multiple docker hosts together.  These hosts are assigned either manager or worker.  Manager can receive docker command and manage the docker services, whereas worker can only run services.  Both manager and worker can run services. 

&#x200B;

When you create docker service, you need to specify number of arguments: like image, port, network.  

Now come the network part, a little complicated:

In order to use load balancer, you need to create an overlay network.  This network does not exist as traditional NIC or a bridge, but it operates on inside a UDP packet.  (I don't want to get too technical here)

Your service might and often contains multiple copies of container of the same image.  These containers assigned unique ipaddress on this overlay network. 

&#x200B;

You have a swarm of 3 hosts.  These 3 hosts must be on a same network.  Their ip are 10.1.1.2-10.1.1.4...

Say, you create a service apache on port 5555.  Your service contains 10 replicas (10 containers).  You published this port 5555 

Now come the load balancer.

every time you hit [10.1.1.2:5555](https://10.1.1.2:5555), you are directed to one of the 10 containers.   These containers exist evenly on 3  hosts.

Now, when you hit [10.1.1.3:5555](https://10.1.1.3:5555), same thing, you will be directed to one of the 10 containers.

same with [10.1.1.4](https://10.1.1.4):5555

&#x200B;

Technically, your docker hosts are the load balancers

in this case, you have 3 load balancers

You don't create the load balancer.  Docker create it for you as part of swarm service. 

&#x200B;

I know it's not easy to swallow this, I suggest that you read docker swarm and network documentation (Docker has excellent documentation)"
