9) Yotanwa - Idk, it doesnt seem like shes strong, she feels overhyped almost. The enemies dont feel strong, and she barely won against them.
8) Karin - Same reason as kanki, honestly could be ranked 3, if it werent for the fact her men arent particularly strong (elites defeated by ousens men despite ousens lack of morale raising)
7) Shouheikun - Probably not the strong, but definately not the weak
6) Moubu - Supposably the strongest with 0 intellect
5) Shin - Plot armour or not my man just killed Houken, and it appears hes becoming an instinctual general like Duke Hyou
4) Tou - Feels like his skill is considered close to Ouki's
3) Riboku - Defeated Ouki
2) Ousen - Matched and outsmarted Riboku quite alot.

Personally, if it was seinen i wouldnt have the feeling of ""Holy shit, i get this is overhyped but imagine if they were actually like this back then"". But, where shounen fails is when it feels like theres serious plot armour or the moronic main character continues being dumb Which is why the longer its drawn out and the more we see the progression, the better it usually is (i say usually cus some shows completely fail at showing progression). In kingdom, we see every progression, every enemy he has to overcome, and the ""talk-no-jutsu"" stuff actually fails nearly every time! *cough cough* Renpa. And in the show, we are finally getting irritated with shin being considered dumb, but considering how long we were able to go before finally getting annoyed at this, its hard to say it was a fault to begin with. So no, it wouldnt have -been- better, but right now, it can be better now."
