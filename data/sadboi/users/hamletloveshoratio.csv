PrequelMemes,fr1es20,t1_fr1chbl,1589818455.0,"Batman fandom and SW fandom are not the same. It's fun to love/hate the prequels... because of Obi Wan. And also because GL didn't give us much choice. The Star Wars cannon (at least at the time) was pretty strictly controlled.

Batman dates back to 1939. It has survived all the ""ages"" from golden to iron and is still going strong. It's been retconned to hell and back. It's had a very active fandom all this time.

The Nolan trilogy is just 3 of dozens of animated and live action iterations of the Bat mythology. All three films are great films thanks to amazing casting and direction, etc.  HOWEVER, the theme started in 2 and culminating in 3 of Bruce wanting to give it all up one day is nothing like the Batman that fans of the comics and movies before and since then have come to love. Batman is well known for being more Bat than Bruce. In fact Bruce is the alter ego. When Bats talks to himself he calls himself Batman. The Bat is seriously mentally ill. His attachment to his Bat identity is pathological. Nolan's film ignore the established psychology of Batman. It is not respectful to the source material.

I can see people being fans of the movie. As I said it's a great movie. It just isn't a great Batman movie because it doesn't have a recognizable Batman in it.

""They call themselves “comrades,” these men, comrades in the socialist revolution. Nor is the word empty and meaningless, coined of mere lip service. It knits men together as brothers, as men should be knit together who stand shoulder to shoulder under the red banner of revolt. This red banner, by the way, symbolizes the brotherhood of man, and does not symbolize the incendiarism that instantly connects itself with the red banner in the affrighted bourgeois mind. The comradeship of the revolutionists is alive and warm. It passes over geographical lines, transcends race prejudice, and has even proved itself mightier than the Fourth of July, spread-eagle Americanism of our forefathers. The French socialist workingmen and the German socialist workingmen forget Alsace and Lorraine, and, when war threatens, pass resolutions declaring that as workingmen and comrades they have no quarrel with each other. Only the other day, when Japan and Russia sprang at each other's throats, the revolutionists of Japan addressed the following message to the revolutionists of Russia: “Dear Comrades—Your government and ours have recently plunged into war to carry out their imperialistic tendencies, but for us socialists there are no boundaries, race, country, or nationality. We are comrades, brothers and sisters, and have no reason to fight. Your enemies are not the Japanese people, but our militarism and so-called patriotism.

I know a few socialists. I am myself a communist, and I promise you that all socialists are NOT on board with welfare. The arguments against a strong welfare state haven't disappeared. We still oppose it, simply speaking, because it mollifies the proles which makes agitation and organization harder.

It would be more appropriate to say there is a serious debate. Crises are the perfect time to recruit, but if material conditions can be improved, even temporarily, it's hard to say ""no"" to that. On the one hand is much needed relief, and on the other is a genuine objection to half measures and bread crumbs that don't really change anything and which CAN BE TAKEN AWAY.

It was like night and day the difference between the two. The first one was over 200 miles away so I couldn't travel to see her. I just had to check in with her via phone, but she was not provided with a room phone by the facility so I had to mail her one. For two days I was going to have to wait to talk to my mother, so I asked them to wheel her to the community phone. They refused several times. Eventually I threatened to call they police and they complied. This was Day 1 at that place. Every day for about 10 days I had to fight with nurses and administrators about giving her the right meds and them leaving her in a soiled bed. They'd ask me how I knew they had not changed her. Like, ""ma'am my mother can talk. She's completely lucid and since I mailed her a cell phone she can call me at 1 a. m. to tell me what a shit job y'all are doing up there.""

The 2nd nursing home was local. I visited daily. It was a nice place. I had a formrr student working there in phys therapy, do there was a kind of personal connection. She was well taken care of. She hated being there, because she hated hospitals, but it was temporary, thankfully.

Anyway, I can only imagine the horror stories you must have heard over the years, and with little you could do to help that must have been frustrating. I know my blood pressure couldn't have handled much more of nursing home hell."
