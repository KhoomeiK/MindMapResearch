I'm a staunch liberal, but I believe in the death penalty if they could figure out how to do it correctly, and it was truly beyond reasonable doubt, proven by DNA or other sure facts. Also, there is a lot to be learned from people like that. Look at how much John Douglas was able to do for the field of criminal psychology, just by having interview access to killers. Also, there's definitely a reason to keep someone alive when they have pertinent information relating to their crimes. If someone killed my family member, Id rather be able to know where their body is than to have the killer just executed. Not to mention how much taxpayers have to pay for executions (which is somehow more expensive than just life in prison), and all the appeals these people are entitled to by law. Lawrence Bittaker basically just gave bullshit appeals and got stays of execution until California stopped the death penalty, and he died of old age. I personally think a guy that unquestionably evil should just be taken out back and shot in the head.

I find GC games scratch the label very easily, and that'll ruin the disc. Always a good call at a thrift to hold the disc up to the light, if you can see areas of light shining through, leave it (or buy it and sell the case lol)"
gamecollecting,fpcolp7,t1_fpchqu2,1588508085.0,"Seriously, I used to work at a retro game store and tons of people would ask us if we could call them when we got Melee. I'd tell em if there was a list, you'd probably be waiting over a year. Also, this GameCube generation is wild. I mean, look at the top 5 best selling GC games (Melee, double dash, super Mario sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, and Animal Crossing). All of them have shot up wildly the past year to like $50+, meanwhile I still find Sunshine and Animal Crossing at thrifts often."

Shittygamecollecting,fp27tgw,t1_fp2796m,1588256859.0,"I have over 500 Nintendo games dude, been collecting for 15 years. I'm just saying, they are the the Apple of video games. Everything has to be proprietary, and there are rarely price drops. Almost 3 years after it came out, Super Mario Odyssey is still $50. In 2 years, almost every wide release game for PS4 and Xbox are $10 or less. It's just wild to me how much they get away with because they have so many famous characters"
