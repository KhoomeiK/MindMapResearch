fishtank,fquszil,t1_fqq1hpe,1589664113.0,"I used to sell fish for a big box store and got used to toeing the line between what you ought to have for good husbandry and what's reasonable for a new hobbyist to shell out for.  I really, really recommend the API master test kit and seachem prime for water conditioner.  The master test kit because the results are clear and consistent unlike the strips and knowing your parameters is crucial to fishkeeping.  Prime water condition because it's the cheapest option when you realize how many gallons it treats - only 2 drops prime per gallon - and the fact that you can dose it up to and over 3x the recommended dose and it will detoxify ammonia temporarily and buy you time to do your water changes.

If you get the test kit, your goals are 0 ppm ammonia, 0 ppm nitrite, and under 20 ppm nitrate.  If you've got high ammonia and no nitrite or nitrate, you've got ""new tank symdrome"".  Your tank hasn't grown the beneficial bacteria to process the ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate.  If you have some ammonia, some nitrite, and no nitrate, you have started your cycle but only have the first wave of beneficial bacteria, those that convert ammonia to nitrite.  Another wave of bacteria will come along and convert nitrite to nitrate.  If you've got 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite, and high nitrate, your tank has completed its cycle and you just need more water changes to clear things out.  The happy coincidence is that in all the above situations, a 30% water change will greatly improve water quality.  It will slow down the speed at which your bacteria colonize, but since you already have a fish in there, your priority should be to keep the levels low enough for the health of the fish, rather than rushing to get it cycled. 

My guess is that your old tank had been around long enough to have already been colonized by beneficial bacteria, but your new tank was sterile.  If you've got gravel or filter cartridges from the old tank that have stayed wet, wrap them in panty hose and drop them in the new tank.  This is called seeding and will introduce beneficial bacteria to colonize the tank."
horsetrainingadvice,fqur6b3,t1_fqs17ez,1589663327.0,"Halter and lead rope.  Start on the left.  With the rope taut, but no pressure yet, place your left hand on the shoulder and your right hand behind the withers, holding the rope between them.  Move your left hand back towards the withers and down a bit and get some pressure on the halter.  This will give you some leverage if he tries to pull the rope out of your hands.  Keep the pressure consistent and keep returning your hands to their places at and slightly behind his withers.  Again, consistent pressure, no tugging, no irritation, no judgment. Just patience and wait for him to give.

The second he tips his head, release and praise.  Let him just tip his head a few times with that release of pressure and maybe lead him around a minute to reduce frustration. Then expect him to go a little further.  And further.  And further until his nose touches the outside of his shoulder.  Repeat on the other side.

Then repeat with a snaffle bit from the ground.  This will go much quicker. Then back to where I was talking about in my other comment where you're in the saddle and pull the rein around to your knee.  Consistent pressure, consistent reward and don't let him frustrate you.  Don't try to do this if you have something else pressing to do.  Horses work on barn time and so should a horseperson.

travel,fqj9u3b,t1_fqh7r3i,1589407001.0,Greater Swiss mountain dog loose in the Andes Mountains? We're sure that's what this is and not one of the thousand similar-looking crosses that would be much more likely to wind up there?
travel,fqj9mes,t1_fqihpy1,1589406917.0,There's a ton of black and tan tricolor dogs.  This isn't necessarily a greater Swiss either.  You absolutely cannot tell from this picture.
rarepuppers,fqiq8si,t1_fqiplbs,1589399412.0,Unfortunately unscrupulous breeders will often breed for larger dogs as they have larger litters.  You'll see things like 35 lb Boston terriers as a result.
rarepuppers,fqimf5n,t1_fqikm84,1589397947.0,They're not all mean. They do tend to be defensive of their person and they often suffer from little dog syndrome.  A well-raised and socialized pom makes a wonderful pet though.
TalesFromRetail,fqiezu4,t3_giu8f4,1589395120.0,What fun.  I had a very common last name and always had people asking me if I was related to such and such person from wherever.
Skookum,fqiei3z,t1_fqidfou,1589394921.0,Kind of just looks like something they had on hand that happens to be conveniently heavy.  What they had it lying around for I couldn't even begin to guess.  But it's heavy and they need a heavy thing to calibrate with.
forkliftmemes,fqicujx,t1_fq3xide,1589394302.0,We used to do competitions at my last place where you'd have a tennis ball on a cone on a pallet and have to ever so gentle pick it up and turn it around.  Couldn't do that on these Yales.  They just randomly cachunk the opposite direction when you go to extend or retract the forks.  We've even got one where the horn goes off when you lower the forks to the ground.  Why? Just why?
Ornithology,fqicazz,t1_fqhp7ay,1589394099.0,"That wasn't directed at you, sorry.  That was for the automod who called me a potty mouth."
rarepuppers,fqic2kg,t1_fqhm135,1589394003.0,I wish they didn't have a tendency for nasty temperaments.  They're so cute and carry-aroundable.  But a spitz is a spitz.
rarepuppers,fqibwt2,t1_fqi2jko,1589393938.0,"A lot of dogs do that.  Maybe bring it up at your next vet check, but I wouldn't worry. They're trying to cover up their mess."

Equestrian,fqgnq5e,t3_gilezt,1589351405.0,"Not that you need to hide anything, she's gorgeous, but if you take your pictures from a little lower down, it will make her look more square and show off her conformation better."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fqg81dc,t1_flg1qto,1589339970.0,You want r/aquariums probably.  The ichthyology sub is more illustrations and articles.
Ichthyology,fqg7qra,t3_giqsta,1589339784.0,"Adopt a sturgeon.  I'm particularly fond of the pallid sturgeon myself, whose lifecycle has been threatened by the channelization of the Missouri River.  They naturally breed and grow in the slower backwaters that are getting rarer and rarer as we attempt to domesticate a wild river."
Ichthyology,fqg7hwn,t3_ghvmfs,1589339633.0,Love it.  Keep them coming!
Ornithology,fqfquar,t1_fqeqlpu,1589329912.0,"Are we being serious right now automod? Male roosters and many other birds are called cocks.

Cocks Cocks Cocks."
Ornithology,fqfqetq,t1_fqeqlpu,1589329679.0,Rooster makes no sense in the context of ravens.  Cock would be the word.
Horses,fqfk59z,t1_fqf9jzj,1589326349.0,They manage the wild mustang herds.
knots,fqfjoao,t1_fqe8o5l,1589326108.0,"I'm a sucker for French whipping myself, but west country looks understated and secure."
animalid,fqfingi,t1_fqdze6e,1589325576.0,"Very cool.  Not a beaver at all despite the name but the last surviving species of the family Aplodontiidae.  Only found in the rainforests of the Pacific northwest.

Always wanted to see one.  We had a skull to study in school but that's the closest I'll probably ever get."
whatsthisplant,fqa1h43,t1_fq9o308,1589211104.0,"I think it's parts of the Midwest.   If you pull out the petals, the bottom of each has a bit of nectar."
whatsthisplant,fq9mfrf,t1_fq8zse7,1589202234.0,Honeysuckle as in red clover or the shrub? I don't think columbine is particularly closely related to either.
LeopardsAteMyFace,fq8ehoh,t1_fq8bamj,1589164380.0,I think he's saying that's how people are explaining it away.  Not that it's what he believes.
Narcolepsy,fq48x91,t1_fq32oqn,1589074853.0,Zyn/dryft/vevo/rogue are all nicotine pouches with no tobacco.  That's my goto.  And a can of skol just in case.
