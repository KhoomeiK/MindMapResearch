BPD,fppqija,t3_gejk6d,1588807203.0,I relate to every word of this. I’m proud of myself for being able to accept that I have been a good partner to my boyfriend and that I deserve better treatment. But sometimes I go down a spiral of releasing that conviction and giving into the belief that I’m always the cause of everything bad in our relationship. Do you ever experience that? I’m feeling it now currently. I know I deserve so much better but I still blame myself. I don’t know how to feel sure of anything
BPD,f9u4h03,t1_f9sxr9v,1575644203.0,This is why the concept of marriage terrifies me lol
BPD,f9m4iz4,t1_f9m16di,1575441282.0,"Yeah, same here. It was comforting reading your post because I don’t really know anyone personally who has had this happen to them repeatedly. I wish the best for you too. 

Owning up to “not handling things properly” still doesn’t provide any sense of closure or explanation for how they so convincingly felt one way and then acted like they never did at the drop of a hat."
BPD,f9lyu09,t3_e5ofyb,1575435805.0,"This has happened to me with 3 different people in the past few years. And although I’ve doubted myself multiple times, they’ve ended up apologizing to ~me~ for it and saying they could have handled things better. So I know, by their word, that it’s not something that was my fault. And yet I continually have this problem. I’m not sure I will ever understand it. But the part about expecting it but still feeling blindsided and surprised when it happens really resonates with me. Happens each time. And honestly I don’t even think it’s the BPD or that I was projecting expectations upon them based on how I felt. Which says a lot for me to be so confident in saying that. Makes me terrified to date someone and increasingly fearful that I’ll never be truly loved again."

BPD,f95z0ed,t1_f95tkfs,1575137404.0,"Oh my god YES. 

I made it a whole month not reaching out to him. And honestly the only reason I was able to is because I was sure he would have reached out by then. Whether just to say hi and check in, or maybe some drunken late night message saying he missed me. But I got nothing. Same as you. Two days ago I had a moment of weakness and reached out and he was so unbothered by the fact that we hadn’t spoken in so long. The indifference killed me, especially because I have to will my own MIND every second to stray from thinking of him. 

I’m so sorry to hear about your situation. Sounds so incredibly painful. It honestly amazes and inspires me that you’ve had the restraint to refrain from reaching out and the willpower to just keep going in general."

Sure, there are little things that might bother me every now and again but I’d feel kind of guilty if I were to dwell on the negatives. As if I’m doing him and what he means to me a disservice. I don’t want him to become someone I view negatively (even though it won’t affect him if I do and even though it would help me fall out of love) because he deserves better than that. Maybe it sounds kind of silly."

I’ve had my fair share of experiences where I’ve felt more strongly for someone than they did for me, but I’ve never been fully in love with someone who doesn’t feel anything toward me at all. It’s really painful. I’m sure you know"

BPD,eugsonn,t3_cger4s,1563814150.0,"Whenever I’ve been broken up with, the thing that hurts is feeling that I, inherently, am not what someone wants. I wasn’t funny enough, pretty enough, charming enough; he didn’t feel pulled in by me. I didn’t evoke anything in him. 

In an ideal world, I’d never be broken up with again because it’s pure devastation. But if I were to be broken up with, I’d want to know that all of the things listed above were untrue. That he would want to do anything to be with me for all of those reasons, but the holding him back is something else entirely, something unrelated to those things.

This could be piss poor advice because it’s simply my own opinion, but maybe explain to her that some of her BEHAVIOR has been alarming to you, despite her being wonderful as a person. And for that reason you think it’s best to go your separate ways despite it being a difficult decision.

I say this and at the same time it’s a two-sided coin. If someone told me these things I might think to myself “wow if I changed (or promised to change) these things then nothing would be in our way, he clearly likes me.” Or I might think, “well if the cons outweigh the pros enough for him to not want to be with me, they must be untrue.” Sometimes with BPD there’s no winning. 

It’s a fine line to walk. It means so much that you’re seeking advice and trying to go about it compassionately. In my own experiences no matter what is said a breakup is going to be devastating. Will make me feel as though I wasn’t wanted or wanted enough to keep trying.

I wish you the best and I hope it goes okay."
