unpopularopinion,fr36obu,t3_gmcknn,1589851029.0,"i do agree is starting to get way too much trivialized, but i dont agree with a few points

1) i believe it should be spread and talked more (specially considering is a ramping issue), not in a mainstream way bc definitly aint a dinner talk theme but still shouldnt be avoided, also i have never seen any media show suicide in a positive way, only in foruns/people personal opinion/joke, and tbh i dont think  people need to change the way they speak about it, specially considering many times its a way to deal with shit (or sometimes just humour, which its fine too) 

2) suicide aint glorified either (besides some people, but again you shouldnt censor or shame individuals) all times i saw someone say to stop the stigma it can be 2 things, either they are talking about the stigma of talking about suicide, and that it shouldnt be hold back, or that people should stop assuming that who kills themselfs are selfish and dont think about others, which seems like (atleast online) is a way more popular opinion than i expected, which amazed me, but yeah i think shaming ppl who do it wont lead nowhere, by the oposite will make the ppl who are thinking about it feel even worse, which might fear away at the begining but will create bigger burdens and stresses which might end up throwing the person over the edge later... the act should be shamed, not the people who do it

&#x200B;

also what is the problem in making a suicide joke to a private group or a audience in that style? i mean its humour, just bc u make jokes about it wont make it better or worse, same idea holocaust jokes wont turn people into nazi dictators..."
