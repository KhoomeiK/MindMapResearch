When I returned to my birthplace 1000s of miles from where I grew up, practically a different country in terms of environment, I felt that 'hole' filling up that I couldn't describe.  I was on my way to meet a family member, and as we descended into my birthplace, the first time I'd been there since I'd been adopted and moved 1000s of miles away, I knew exactly where we were. I mean, I knew where we were going, obviously, but my BODY, my SOUL, my HEART felt it and filled up.  

I've had the pain of the opposite of that above feeling, when my birthmother was very hurtful in her words when I found her, and she refused to see or talk to me even a bit. 

Connecting with my sibling decades later, filled it back up, but in a different way.

You've met her.  You lived inside her, and who truly knows how long you lived with her after your birth.

Btw, a lot of records in adoptions were ***allegedly*** destroyed in fires, floods, etc in the last 50 years (not really, but that's what they told people). You might see what state you were officially adopted in, and they should have your original birth certificate.  It may be open to you depending on which state you were adopted in.  You might have already done this, but for anyone else reading it......."

There aren't many of those; most things are a NOPE NOPE NOPE, not even getting on my plate, let alone fork, in mouth, or down to my stomach. I can't for a million dollars swallow foods.  I do find it interesting that I love things like fried shrimp and fried eggs and yogurt, and those closest to me DETEST them and can't eat them at ALL, not even a BITE. Kinda funny.
