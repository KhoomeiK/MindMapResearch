prozac,fmvqx3d,t3_fxmk3q,1586427459.0,"Prozac has definitely done wonders for my artistic hobby. I find myself creating much more often and way more consistently. When I was depressed, anhedonia became a part of the mix, where I lacked desire to do the things I was at one time, really passionate about. My paintings would be hit or miss and I would go through long periods where I would not paint or draw at all and thought I was really done with art. I threw away,, ripped up and destroyed a lot of my work, at one point.. Also, I had long phases of creative blocks, where as now, a few months in on Prozac and I see a dramatic different in my art, for the better, so for me the medication was definitely beneficial."

Maybe a small rise in anxiety for first couple weeks which was offset by the benzodiazepine my doc prescribed to take as needed. Everyone reacts differently to meds. Good luck to you! :)"

prozac,fgp7kuq,t1_fgp3ybj,1580998820.0,"Aw, thank you for asking. Honestly, about the same as you. Not so emotional and not having suicidal thoughts, which is good, feeling a tiny bit more motivated, even just to type on Reddit, is huge for me, because when I shut down, I shut down with the depression, off social media completely and such. 40mg of Prozac, I'm taking in the morning now and it is making me so sleepy at work, so I am thinking of gradually moving it to night time. It's weird though, because I get these random spikes of hyperness and motivation to do stuff that happen throughout my day but then I go back into a low mood again where I just want to lay down and not get off my bed. I feel like I can sleep forever sometimes. Therapy, with the CBT is helping because my therapist, she is such a sweet, understanding, empathic woman who really gets me. I think therapy is helping most of all, because I feel like I'm taking the initiative finally to do something to help myself, as I have been a people-pleaser most of my life and failed greatly at self-care for so long. I'm just trying to find myself. I'm mid-30s and everything in life just hit me hard these last couple years.  I'm also a recovering alcoholic and addict since 2015, so it's a mix of a lot of stuff. I just have to stop sometimes, take a deep breath and remind myself that I am making progress, no matter how small or slow and I am doing the best I can. 

And, so are you. Just know I'm cheering for you, and we are all in this together, even if we don't know each other I'm sending you love on your journey. Take care of yourself and have patience with yourself. One day at a time, my friend. ‚ô°"
prozac,fgp08q5,t3_ezlzmt,1580993349.0,"Hey there, I'm sorry you're having such a rough time. I can relate. I'm also an artist and depression kicked my butt into completely giving up on creating anything for months. I have MDD, complex PTSD, panic disorder and social and generalized anxiety. I started on 20mg of Prozac, with Xanax as needed 1mg, back in Dec. 2019. Was on it for 8 weeks and felt like it helped a little to get rid of the constant feeling of hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation, but still was not where I wanted to be. I still was not creating and having to depend on the Xanax too much to make it through my day. I was also nervous and weary about upping my dose. I want to mention I am also doing self-help CBT, mindfulness and DBT workbooks at home, as well as started to see a mental health counselor around the same time I started the meds, which I believe are also big factors in helping me work through my trauma and reframe my maladjusted thoughts and behaviors. I went back to my doctor and he upped me to 40 mg about a week ago. Since then, I signed up for a hand building clay class at my local museum and also an art journaling class locally at my art teacher's home studio. Attended both on Mon. and Tue. And it went fabulous!Other than being really tired during the adjustment phase of the 40mg, (I may start taking it at night vs. the morning because of that), I haven't experienced any adverse side effects bumping up to 40mg, but on a postive note, I have had increased desire to create again and the motivation and desire I was lacking on 20mg. I know everyone is different, but just wanted to share with you my story and let you know you aren't alone. :) Sending you love and healing energy on your journey."

My doc just bumped me from 20mg to 40mg a week ago, because the 20mg was helping a little, but after 8 weeks on 20mg, my depression was so severe still that I needed a higher dose and I am freaking excessively tired now every single day no matter how much I sleep. Hoping this goes away after the adjustment period, because my mood is getting better, but I hate being tired all of the time. I still have low days, but nearly as much as before the Prozac. Wishing you the best, man."

I have been on many different antidepressants in my life and Prozac has been the right for me (finally), after much trial and error. I hope it all works out for you and it it's not the right med for you, you will know in a few weeks, but don't give up. It took awhile for me to find what works for me and it has been so worth it. I have depression, anxiety, especially social, panic disorder and complex PTSD. At one point in my life suicidal and talk therapy with CBT, DBT and medicine changed my life. It gets better every day! :)"

prozac,fgilitp,t3_eyox3z,1580825071.0,"I know that everyone is different, but from my experience, yes it is normal in the first few weeks to feel heightened anxiety on Prozac. 

I noticed it when I was first put on 20mg, for the first couple weeks, (I have GAD with panic disorder and social anxiety), so my doctor prescribed me a benzodiazepine medication to offset the initial anxiety that is more pronounced with some people during the adjustment period. 

I did become less anxious after about week 3, week 4 on the 20mg. 

I was just bumped up to 40mg, because 20mg wasn't cutting it for my severe MDD and going through the anxiety being heightened again. 

Just make sure you talk to your doctor always about any symptoms. But, for me it was normal and does lessen from my experience in 3 to 6 weeks on same dose. Best of luck to you!"
