I feel like that means she realized it was wrong at the same age as me as well and felt guilty. She didn’t put the rest of my siblings through it and just hoped I’d never talk about it. Seeing as I realized it was wrong the same age that she stopped doing that to me, yes I find her less culpable. It was a curious children’s game that got out of hand and she might’ve not intended to harm me. If her intentions weren’t malicious, and she never did it again after she grew up, then forgiveness is a lot easier."

family,fofbidt,t3_g766qm,1587731959.0,"I’m currently 17, turn 18 in a week, happily married with a baby due July. I moved out because I felt like a burden in my parents house. They have two special needs children, my youngest siblings. The stress of constantly living in hospitals and charity houses got to me. I stopped going to school while living with them, they didn’t seem to have the capability of attending to my deteriorating mental health. I was sent to many inpatient facilities before eventually running away to live with my boyfriend (now husband). Eventually one of my siblings was unwell and they had to get him treatment in another state so they let me get married on September 2019. Since then I have started finishing high school online in a special academy with a flexible schedule. I was also working part time fast food before the whole covid thing. I got a new therapists that I actually see regularly and am establishing a good relationship with. We’re looking to correct a misdiagnosis on my depression, to allow me to get the treatment I need. I am able to handle all this on my own, before moving out it was all in my parents hands and I understand that they have a lot of stress on their plates. I don’t think I know everything, I just know that I know what’s best for me. My parents know too, which is why they let me go. They could’ve never expected what they’ve gone through, countless scares and risky surgeries. My problems weren’t necessarily a priority in their home, now that I’m in a different home they are the top priority. I have complete power over all my school and medical decisions, of course with all the responsibility."
AskParents,foettmd,t3_g72v3f,1587714528.0,"I am in the position of the abused child, the family member in question is my older sister. It happened when I was 9-10 and my sister 13-14. My parents pressed charges against her as soon as they found out, when my sister moved out at 18, I was 14 and had finally realized that what had happened wasn’t right. My close relationship with my sister instantly ended, we haven’t spoken in 3 years. The charges were dropped because we were both minors but my parents didn’t try to mend our relationship. They still have a positive relationship with her. My therapist (multiple therapists I’ve spoken to actually) has encouraged me to forgive my sister, and if I feel comfortable, re-establish a relationship with her. Since learning that my therapists feel this way my parents have subtly been trying to get us to meet again at family events because we haven’t spoken in years. They always let me know ahead of time so I can decide if I want to show up or not. On every occasion I haven’t shown or showed up when I’m sure she’s not there. I still don’t feel ready but knowing that my family supports my mental health is great. They’re not forcing me into anything even though I have let them know that me forgiving my older sister might be in the future. They still give me the choice and having it comforts me because I know one day I will choose to meet my abuser again."

When she finally takes her first steps (makes her own art) then celebrate it! I did with my sister even if I didn’t find her first pieces amazing quality. I knew she put a lot of effort into it, and I offered her constructive criticism and most importantly, I complimented what I found to be good. She’s growing into an amazing artist and have promised to commission her to draw my son when he’s born. She’s excited to have her first payed work!

family,fm9907d,t3_ftr3tv,1585864020.0,"I got married at 17, and leaving my parents home was a huge deal. I was constantly stressed with my younger siblings because they’re constantly in and out of hospitals. When one of them was hospitalized I’d have to take care of the rest at home and even take care of their medications and feeding tubes since I was 14. I sometimes do feel a bit selfish for leaving but in the end, they are NOT my responsibility. I love my siblings but they aren’t my kids, for fucks sake I’m still a kid. 

Of course I love my husband and he is my entire support system, and I am his. So I didn’t get married just to get out, the suffocation of living with my family just pushed me a little more. In another world I can confidently say I’d still be with my husband if I had a better home life, but speeding up the process of getting out and recovering from the trauma I’ve suffered sooner rather than later, will definitely help me in the long run. 

Thanks to my husband I finally feel like I own my life. I’m responsible about what happens to me, I can go to doctors and therapists appointments without my parents problems standing in the way. I can finish high school, maybe even go to college someday! Living with my family I went more days absent at school than attended. I feel liberated because I got married, and the person I chose to spend the rest of my life with is the best thing that ever happened to me. I am his priority and he is mine, we only have to worry and take care of each other, and we’ve been doing a spectacular job."

AskReddit,figaruc,t3_f7vygu,1582397719.0,"I’ve been thinking about this since childhood. It would be called Cydonia. I would want everything to be community based, and very organized. Communities will be seen similar to cities. All the food would be locally grown, the government would feed and house everyone, but in payment citizens must contribute to society. I’m not sure how I want money to work yet but, the cydonian calendar will have ten months, like it used to be before Julius Caesar fucked it up. The school system will be completely rewritten to teach the basics of the core subjects taught up to age 10.  It will also teach emotional intelligence and based on the community they study at they will be encouraged to learn a 2nd language. By then they should choose what areas they would like to explore more in depth, and would not be forced to commit to anything they initially choose. But certain classes will be unlocked by taking previous classes hopefully. They can study one thing one semester and the opposite the next, this will give them a chance to network with students of similar interests and build lasting relationships hopefully. At 16-18 they will start learning how to be functioning members of society. They will also learn basic survival skills in the event that our society collapses. At 20 they will apply to be assigned to their most preferred jobs. The government will assign their job and they will be compensated according to their impact to society. They must remain in their assigned job for a contract that they will negotiate with a case manager. That way if they are skeptical about wether or not they want to head a different direction, they still have time to change their mind, but the economy won’t collapse because of constant job jumping. It is preferable that you studied what you wanted to be at school before age 20 but, ages 20-30 you will still be allowed apprenticeships where available in case you find interest in something you did not study. My country is obviously very education based in hopes of giving everyone a fair chance to be something in life. I hope for free health care to all citizens, and an easy immigration process. That being said the government will also be allowed to reassign people from their community if it is felt they are not functioning properly; examples: lack of hygiene, lack of social functioning. Obviously there is people who prefer being alone so they can be moved to less dense communities. As for the justice system; all crimes must have a default sentence. It will start with general crimes; murder, theft, fraud, kidnapping. All will have a basic sentence. From then if someone feels their sentences is unfair, we can start adding sub-laws on main ones based on commonly seen circumstances. The most easy example in theft, sentences would be based on value of what was stolen. A default sentence must be held for at least five years before it will be allowed to be re-evaluated and if needed changed based on the moral standards of the living society. If you wish to your sentence can be contested after a default sentence has been lowered, it the default sentence has been increased, the government will not go out of their way to increase your pre-agreed sentence unless you contest it. You will serve your sentence in a rehabilitation community. The rehabilitation will include help for drug abuse (drugs are regulated but not criminalized) and therapy, in addition to revisiting education previously mentioned to be offered to 16-18 year olds, rewritten to help out adults rather than teenagers. In these rehabilitation communities, citizens will be segregated by age, every five years. The living conditions in these communities will be humane, but still of less quality compared to the lowest level assigned housing in functioning society, to encourage rehabilitation. 

I’ve been thinking about this for a while but I still got lots of things to think about more and tweak. When I take over the work I want to start with Nevada and Arizona, and declare independence against the US, maybe steal from Mexico too (sorry). The desert is a very mysterious space with weird energies, I hope to use these energies in my favor by benefiting their ecosystem to the best of my ability."
