Anxiety,fp8ndtz,t3_gbt1n2,1588397052.0,"I got some melatonin (Natrol 5mg, I believe) from Walmart and that really helps. I found a few good ambient playlists on Spotify that help to knock me out."
Anxiety,fp8n6qe,t3_gblx8h,1588396886.0,"I’m on Lexapro (20mg) and I have attacks after taking it sometimes. The right medication can make a huge difference. It’s trial and error. Medication doesn’t completely prevent it, but it does make it more manageable."
Anxiety,fp8mywi,t3_gc0dco,1588396707.0,"Sending hugs. I do believe in medication bc being on Lexapro really helped me to manage things. Medication is hit-or-miss, but the right one can make a huge difference. Deep breathing helps me too. Try taking a deep breath, holding it for 5-8 seconds, then slowly exhaling until your heart rate goes down. Sleep helps a lot. Ambient music, maybe? I found some good ambient playlists on Spotify that help me focus and fall asleep, along with taking melatonin. And you got this!"
Anxiety,fp8mflv,t3_gbscq8,1588396261.0,I struggle with my appearance all the time. I hate it. Just know that nothing about you is ugly or shameful. It’s so hard to love your body. I don’t want you to let dickheads dictate how you feel about yourself (I used to get bullied and I let it consume me.) I hope this helps you.
Anxiety,fp8lvcw,t3_gbwsuo,1588395802.0,"I have this too. I want to say this sounds perfectly normal to me bc anxiety/tension causes you to experience that. But it’s best to get it checked out if you can. Talking to my doctor has given me some peace of mind. Going for walks (anything that helps strengthen your heart) helps. I’ve been walking about 2-3 miles a day and practicing deep breathing. It seems to help in general. Try taking a deep breath, hold it for about 5-8 seconds, then breathe out slowly until your heart calms down. It has helped my shortness of breath. Get plenty of rest and stay hydrated bc that helps circulation, I believe. Hopefully this helps you in some way."
Anxiety,fp8kuvi,t3_gbnjuv,1588394994.0,"Honestly, I’m relieved I only have to work 4 days/week (my hours were reduced due to everything going on.) When I don’t have to work, I feel less stressed. But my job is easy. Having a break from responsibilities is nice. I’m dreading going back to full-time, but I feel ashamed bc so many people are unemployed. I’m thankful for my job, don’t get me wrong. The idea of working anywhere makes me anxious."
GilmoreGirls,fogx2ys,t1_fofrg1s,1587757958.0,Jackson deserves more representation.
GilmoreGirls,fogwy90,t3_g79egq,1587757916.0,"Ugh! I hated that! It was something that was special to their friend, and it was NOT the place to argue. They seemed more concerned with their own drama. While I love them, it annoys me to no end how selfish they can be at times."
MazeRunner,fogwms2,t1_foeouz0,1587757812.0,"Brenda’s role in The Fever Code was refreshing to me. I admit, Teresa’s storyline was confusing to me when I first read the books. It was confusing for me to tell whether or not Teresa had her memories and where."
MazeRunner,foehfcl,t1_foeg6dy,1587703853.0,True
MazeRunner,foe42dg,t3_g6n78m,1587695613.0,I agree!
MazeRunner,foe0reb,t3_g6n78m,1587693783.0,"I believe Teresa was heavily brainwashed by WCKD. I didn’t actually dislike her character. I liked how the movie showed her finding the cure because it showed what she believed in. But I do believe she shouldn’t have trusted WCKD with it. After all that was done to them, I agreed with Thomas on that."
MazeRunner,fnwtgss,t3_g474c7,1587325116.0,"I don’t understand how she could still trust WCKD after seeing everything Thomas had. Remember in the books/movies when she explained to Thomas what had happened to her mother and that there were so many others suffering, with stories like hers? I feel like she had good intentions. But (especially in the second movie) she endangered a lot of people. Even she lied to Thomas for “the greater good.” My feelings about her death are mixed, but it was still sad for me."
MazeRunner,fnv4dmk,t3_g3xalw,1587279847.0,"WCKD brainwashed, tortured and manipulated those kids and, imo, possibly their employees. The idea of an organization for finding a cure is great and all, but let’s not forget they killed in innocent people and ripped children from their homes. They treated the immunes like they were disposable. In The Fever Code, there was George’s death and everything Dr. Paige did in the end. So many lies. And I found it interesting how Thomas had his memories erased and put into the Maze the way he was, right when he was really starting to learn the truth about what was going on. I also feel like they crossed lines as far as the kids’ privacy. I mean, how scary is the idea of having a chip put in you w/out say that can do all that? It really bothered me reading about how they tortured Minho when he tried to escape. Also, forcing Thomas and his friends to watch?! Nothing about their methods in these books were trustworthy. I agree with the other comments, that they should have also focused on stopping the spread. WCKD could have saved so many lives. In conclusion, I’d say, no, WCKD is not good. I have so much more faith in Thomas and his friends."

Supernatural,fm392j1,t3_fsl24a,1585716152.0,"Sam is my favorite because I’ve always related more to him. He overcame his addiction and struggles, and that part of him that was drawn to darker things. Despite his mistakes, he taught me to keep fighting. I always thought he was more open. The way he is with other people (whether or not they made him more of a support character) was something I always loved about him. I’ve always been the kind of person who digs deeply into lore and occult research, too. His sense of humor and personality in general is more of what I’m drawn to. But I always thought he was so strong."
lexapro,fkpbbpc,t3_fjopag,1584406073.0,YES! The only thing that seems to help is stretching my legs (touching my toes while sitting with my legs straight) and massaging my legs. I hate it.
Anxiety,fkons3y,t3_fjhxly,1584391032.0,"Same thing goes through my mind! It sucks! I’m sorry you’re dealing with panic attacks. I’m on Lexapro and I take melatonin (5mg) before bed every night. Just found out I might have SVT (a heart condition where your heart rate gets high) so that made my anxiety worse, but taking the meds helps keep my heart rate down somewhat. The melatonin really helps me sleep. Before I started it, I would be up for hours bc of my anxiety."
GilmoreGirls,fhfwrao,t3_f2rv6e,1581553137.0,"I agree that they were all (in a way) shitty. At least Jess and Logan challenged Rory. IMO, Dean was the worst. Between his constant clinginess and the entire situation with Lindsay, his character went downhill FAST. He was abusive. I loved him at first and I wish I could say I love him now. I have to rant about Logan... I cannot stand how he kept having affairs. He came across as entitled and snobby—how he treated Jess was so unnecessary. While he had his good moments, I don’t like Logan. Although, at least Logan showed up for Rory most of the time. I think Rory and Logan were most alike. I think Jess’ behavior was understandable, given his childhood. It makes sense to me why he’d have commitment or communication issues. I also think that his time with Rory shaped their characters. Sometimes, you need to date a “Jess” to understand what you deserve or don’t want in a relationship. He was definitely flaky, but I liked him the most. Finally, I agree that it seems like Dean was bitter towards Luke for being able to stay with the Lorelais."
