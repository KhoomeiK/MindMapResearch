Lyrics:

Missä kouhuu tyrskyt veen,
siellä vou tuo virta muistojen. 
Uinu kultain turvas ain,
ja lohdon löydät sanostain. 

Alta hyisen pinnan sen, 
teito löytyy, polku kultainen. 
Tyynnyttää sen milers suo,
mut varo et ei vie sen vou. 

Niin toiset laulan kulla voi, 
ja sävel sen näin taikaa soi,
mut rohkee täytyy olla sun 
tiedon kun, saat sa salatun. 

Missä kouhuu tyrskyt veen,
siellä oottaa äiti muistojen. 
Sinne kulje pikkuinen,
ja löytä saat, sa totuuden."

you are clearly dealing with a lot of things right now, with the PTSD and your grandmother dying so suddenly. unfortunately if your grandfather doesn't remember you, all you can do is try and rekindle the relationship with a fresh slate, Alzheimer's a bitch. however if its way to stressful and enables your PTSD and will make it worse for you then its okay to not feel comfortable. it all depends on what you want to do. do your family know about your mental illness? perhaps it'll make it a bit more accepting if they did. ther is no shame in having a mental disorder, especially if it wasn't your fault."

relationship_advice,f49zd4v,t1_f49s5oj,1571486550.0,i guess since you seem to be unsure about things regarding her health id still suggest to go see a doctor and weigh out all your options from there. it really all depends on what your wife is willing to do here. if she is unconvinced by you then perhaps a doctor would be more helpful.
relationship_advice,f49r06a,t3_dk1p77,1571480891.0,"now i am going to put this through: i don't typically like it when abortion is just used as an escape from hasty actions or just overall contraception, however the main thing i'm looking at right now is that you said about your girlfriends health. it seems from what you posted she cannot physically go through a full term pregnancy or childbirth. you should honestly consult a doctor about her health and whether the right thing to do is to get one. i don't think you'll be judged at all (many people are completely fine with that reason) if it is your girlfriends health that is a serious issue with her having a child. although i'm very curious to know what is exactly wrong with her that is preventing her having a child.

the earlier you two resolve this the easier it will be. late term abortions are not going to be fun, heck even an early abortion isn't. your best advice i can give you right now is to talk to her. ask her if she is okay with having one if a pregnancy will affect her health badly. if she really doesn't wan to get one, don't try to convince her yourself and take her to consult with a doctor to find out if she is well enough to have a child, if she is and she wants to have a child, then i really don't know what you can do other than support her. if she is too unwell to have a child and ends up getting an abortion for the sake of her health, then support her because getting an abortion may affect her mental health and she may start blaming herself.

communication is very important, especially in a situation like this. but don't be overly rough or turn anything into an argument. bear in mind that she is currently pregnant, she might be overly emotional but don't just ignore her if she is seriously worried. please consult a doctor, it may be enough to either convince her, or perhaps give some more insight into her health.

i hope i made some sense and i wish you well with your current situation.

:)"

i honestly think you aren't in the wrong, or are a complete asshole for waking them up, although you do seem a bit naive.

i'm guessing the correct thing to do here was to just write the information down although the husband didn't seem to tell you about the wife's phone prior to this story. i know full well i wouldn't text any of my friends that late at night unless i knew they were awake. i guess the husband could have told you who to text and that, but no one is really prepared for that tbh. 

perhaps apologize? if you haven't already and def keep that phone information in mind or just write it down and text them in the morning."

if so, then i recommend you buy a cheap pack of pencils ranging from H to around 6B. it'll really help you darken some of the values in your artwork and make the lighter parts really pop out.  don't be afraid to apply darker values in a drawing!

i don't know if those patchy parts in the background were intentional, but if they weren't i would recommend you get a piece of scrap paper to rest your hand on to prevent smudging.

unfortunately when i was sent to the mental health facility (just a place where people can get therapy and it's not a mental hospital) to discuss any problems about my weight or how i viewed myself i was told that i'd need to wait until i get tested for autism (this could take more than a year) basically that's the reason i really don't want to see anyone for help because i'm afraid they'll just say that and leave me again.
