ADHD_Programmers,fn5qb0n,t3_fylquj,1586672300.0,"I feel what you are saying. It makes me think of how when I go into a book store or a video rental place (there are a few left for nostalgia and rare bits) I am immediately flooded with an anxiety at the presence of so many words. There is also something about new nouns that my brain literally blurs them out at times.

I like the analogy of sound because most of my deepest meditative or transcendental states have been purely auditory. I think what you are saying is that it's easiest to exist and function when you are a passively hearing vs being asked something of. I speculate that maybe in a phenomenological sense, breaking out of it is a matter of repeatedly and briefly altering the narrative."

DMT,fmss5zt,t1_flwb4mm,1586361151.0,I highly recommend paint for the therapeutic process.

bipolar,fmlz6af,t3_fw3hng,1586195842.0,"I'm a chef who is now out of work due to the virus. I normally cook and eat more on the vegan side but I came across ostrich, which I had never tried before. I've been cooking new meals most days since being out of a job, which has been good for the most part. My intention has been to start my own food truck for a while now, and I want to use this time to work towards that...

Ever just feel like, you don't really want anything though? This last job was my favorite one that I have ever had, and I was really successful and made a lot of major positive changes. But then it ended how most things seem to end for me; awkwardly, abruptly, without closure. I don't know if I just need more time, or if I just need more passion. I just can't pour myself into anything all the way right now. Thought about going back into writing, or painting. As I write this I'm kind of like why not all of those? Why am I being so morose about it? I just feel massively depressed and really it has always been there. I have extreme difficulty maintaining connections with people. I feel like, I made so many friends this year but now it feels like most of them were shallow connections, and the ones that weren't got messed up, sometimes my fault sometimes theirs. I don't know, I've never written anything like this publicly before, especially so casually. Not sure what I'm expecting."

pornfree,fm4i377,t3_fso4tu,1585754562.0,"Alright. There is a gold nugget somewhere in the point that you are trying to make, for sure, but I have an issue with this post and I'm going to explain why.

I just recently followed this sub and maybe this is the generally accepted tone, so I hope you don't feel like I'm attacking you. The mindset that you convey is one that I feel like I understand deeply and have a lot of empathy for. That being said, what do you actually mean? What do you mean when you talk about a strict definition of porn? What do you mean by getting off the hook?

My point is that this is not a moral or religious issue and as long as it is it will have a polarizing, pendulum swinging, intoxicating effect on the individual. Guilt is never ever ever a catalyst for learning, especially learning why it is that you do a thing, why you want to change it, and what a rational and transparent way of doing that would look like. 

There isn't anything inherently wrong with porn, or soft porn, or Instagram. There isn't anything inherently wrong with masturbating either. At the same time, many of these things become issues for us as individuals. The question is why? We should take our specific brand of what may be considered ""perversion"" seriously, meaning we should give it space and respect as a signpost that wants to lead us to uncover a buried pathology.

Personally, my prescription for most people is not to stop but to set rules for yourself that you know you can keep, first. I will provide examples of ones that I used on myself.

&#x200B;

1. You have to pay for it. Nothing is free and no one is entitled to anything. The fact that free online porn impacted our society as most of us here were entering puberty is not different from the fact that food corporations have been feeding us food that they know is highly addictive and simultaneously shaping our relationship to ourselves through marketing campaigns governed by psychological research. We have been drugged. We have been sedated. Free porn metabolizes in the mind the way refined sugar does in the body. To pay for it from artists and producers you respect vs bottom feeding is to enact a paradigm shift that will put you on a healing path.
2. You have to think about it. Give yourself parameters within which to give into the fantasy of it and then analyze the experience and your subtle drives through journaling or talking to someone. Which plays into
3. Be transparent. Not annoying. Not morally masturbatory. Not with everyone. Just know inside of yourself that this is not a secret and also that you are not abnormal.
4. Pick one specific thing to watch, and don't skip or fast forward. Multiple tabs open is a common thing for porn addicts and what that indicates to me is that we are getting dopamine from selecting the ""hottest"" thing. The thing most worthy of our jiz. Well it's pretty apparent that that facet is what leaks into the social phobias associated with this addiction. So introducing patience is essential, and this tenant gives me that.
5. Watch porn directed by women. It has a fundamentally different tone and often it will point you towards what is broken in your sexuality. Why doesn't all of this exposure to sex mean that we are good in the bed? It is an issue of directed attention and attention span and a false link between abstract concepts and ""orgasm"". I think that by and large, people with this addiction do not know what an orgasm is. The pinnacle of that experience is so much higher than we think and it comes with deep levels of trust and self acceptance and letting go. My hope for all of you is orgasm, not abstinence.

These are mine, and I hope that you personalize your own. Please be kind to yourself is all I ask. Don't be a swearwolf, be a scientist. It's more fun anyways."

I think, based on observation, that at the highest level you know for sure that you are just playing a role but maybe are satisfied in it anyways???... Like if you play your favorite character in the movie, who really cares about the fact that you kept a foot in feeling alone the whole time."
