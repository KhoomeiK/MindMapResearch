Your privacy is no joke. He's disrespected you in many ways. You're right, there's something wrong with him but by reading your comments, his parents are not dismissive of his behavior and therefore he has no punishment for acting this way. Protect yourself -- you come first. And it's clear that no one is going to stand up for you, apparently. What toxic family you have! I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.

I say have a discussion with him. He isn't contributing in anyway and there is literally no point in keeping him around if he isn't planning to change.

&#x200B;

Anyway, in terms of your post. I think you will regret leaving your partner. But I do think you should have a conversation with them about potentially not wanting kids in the future and see if they're okay with that. I don't think it will be smart to stay with someone that has a different idea of having a family / no family because in the end, there will be conflict over this. I think an option could be to have separate bedrooms? Or to have designated alone-time and together-time -- maybe picking certain days of the week to spend time together and certain days where they will expect you to want to be alone. Hope this helps stimulate some ideas and eases that anxiety -- I know making these decisions is absolutely terrifying! xx"

Also, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs better to stay away from cliques like this. If that‚Äôs not possible, or if it‚Äôs a no-friends or their your friends situation, then... I try to befriend maybe one girl from the group and either hangout with her alone or stick to her when the other girls are around. This helps to avoid being the butt of jokes and kind of gives you a safer way into the group. But in general, I‚Äôve found that having a mix of boys and girls as friends is the best way to avoid that awful stereotypical clique behavior, and allows you to be able to actually enjoy the company of your friends.

There will likely be no one else on your cruise that booked it solo and your chances of meeting like minded people will be slim.

I think it might be a good idea if you aren‚Äôt looking to meet new people and if there are planned excursions you can go on each day, and just return to the boat at night to sleep and to get between cities easier.

These are all things I also use to organize my personal life, school life and work life! I‚Äôve used all the systems you‚Äôre referring to and have felt that some are cluttered and make me more stressed.

Examples of some I have eliminated include multiple white board lists, sticky notes and computer folders for everything. I found these tend to be cluttered and messy the most. Instead, I stick to my Wunderlist app (a to do list app that syncs across all of my devices and is free) instead of sticky notes and memo pads. Instead of computer folders, I use a cloud based filing system, called OneDrive. This way, I can also access it on any device and when I am not using it to store documents, etc, it is out of my way and not cluttering my environment. I also like GoogleDrive for this as well. Lastly, I used an online planner and written planner. GoogleCal is great like you‚Äôve said, but sometimes I like to write my day out so my written planner is great for that.

However I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an excuse to keep dirty dishes and Tupperware in your bedroom especially if these are communal items. If it‚Äôs your own Tupperware that only you use, then great! But leaving dirty dishes lying around attacks bugs, even mice, and is super unsanitary and unhealthy to have in your environment. It is unfair that your roommate needs to venture into your private space to retrieve dirty communal items to be able to use them. It‚Äôs easy enough to leave them dirty in the kitchen if cleaning them is too much effort at the moment you used them, I feel like that is the acceptable way to deal with the issue here.

 I am not trying to bash you or be rude. I‚Äôm simply trying to explain this from the other persons perspective and how it feels, for you to understand why they might be annoyed or upset with this behavior of yours.

It‚Äôs annoying when communal items like dishes, cups and Tupperware go missing suddenly. Buy your own if your roommate going to retrieve them from your messy space bothers you. It would mean you could use them and leave them for however long you wish without them needing to venture in, however.... if leftover food is left too long it obviously  gets moldy. If my roommates leave moldy dishes lying around even in their own space, it is absolutely not okay even if it‚Äôs their own items! It‚Äôs just completely unclean and a characteristic of depression, yes, but also of hoarding behavior. Seek therapy or other forms of support to cope with your depression in other ways."
