This actually happened a month or two ago right before quarantine. I Met a girl on tinder and we hit it off. She invited me over to have sex but her house was two hours away. I did the drive and it was this extremely small town. When I say small I mean they had around 3 or 4 streets of houses and a grocery store.

I got inside her room which was in the garage. I stepped inside and there was a pot plant sitting on her desk that she was growing and a bunch of surreal rainbow drawings that she told me she drew while high on LSD. There was a bedsheet separating half of the room, one side was hers with a mattress on the ground and a pet guinea pig. The other side was what I assume  was her sisters room along with her sisters newborn baby (Whom I didn’t know was in the room at the time), who were also in the room at the time.

I didn’t want to hurt her feelings and I had already driven two hours anyways so I said ‘fuck it’ and we had sex. Afterwards we hung out for a bit and me, her, the sister, and her dad all went outside and we smoked a few joints. She told her dad and I quote “I finally found a guy that’s kind enough to blow me” and her dad gave me a high-five. 

She then offered to sell me some LSD before I left to which I politely declined since I didn’t have enough money so we said our goodbyes and I went home."
