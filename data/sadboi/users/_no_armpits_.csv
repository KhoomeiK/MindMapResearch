Can I also suggest, try to think of a concept rather than wait for it to come to you (which I personally thing is fantastic too!), create it in your mind or on a note pad and draw what you‚Äôd like to achieve with the shot, where you can do it, what time of day will be best for light, how long until you can get everything together for you to execute it and your hopes for the final product. If you‚Äôve set this up and gone for what you had in your mind, trust me - you‚Äôll find a lot more shots within that concept that you haven‚Äôt thought of along with what you have :-)

My 19yo daughter wrote me a Snapchat message of her own accord, out of the blue, saying how brave she thought I was, how much she loved me and the killer line that hit me in the heart was ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be me without you‚Äù.  

I would say that was when I started fighting again. To be well. I have three younger kids who needed me, who wouldn‚Äôt be them without me.
