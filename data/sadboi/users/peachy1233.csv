abuse,eyrw9js,t3_cy81kv,1567380097.0,hi sweetie. first of all I hope you're okay. I am glad you got out of that awful situation. I know exactly how you are feeling. im going through very similar stuff and I also feel bad for my abuser. but I am so proud of you for telling the police. that takes strength. it is normal to miss him and feel bad for him and regret putting him in jail. but you saved yourself. he will be okay. I am praying for you. pm me if you want to talk

He said he loved me after he cheated, I made the mistake of taking him back, he cheated more. Don‚Äôt disrespect yourself like that. Find someone who won‚Äôt lie and cheat."

relationships,ewggnvr,t1_ewga5xv,1565381415.0,"It was open, so he didn‚Äôt really cheat. If you don‚Äôt want him seeing people outside of the relationship, don‚Äôt make it open? I don‚Äôt see the point of open relationships... just break up if you both can‚Äôt sexually commit to one another and clearly want other people. I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôre going through. They will figure it out hopefully. The most I would do it your gut is telling you to is leave him an anonymous message."
relationships,ewg7553,t3_cnuytk,1565375378.0,Sorry I didn‚Äôt read the post but the title says it all. Dump him like the trash he is and don‚Äôt even look back.

relationships,ewg65eg,t1_eweyjfn,1565374743.0,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too long... pets are part of the family and I completely understand. It‚Äôll take some time but 6 months IMO is normal...if I lost one of my babies I would be devastated for the same amount if not longer
relationships,ewg5va0,t3_co02gh,1565374565.0,If he‚Äôs moving away it seems kind of pointless because you guys are so young..

Move onto someone you can trust and doesn‚Äôt complicate things for you. This situation is unnecessary and doesn‚Äôt involve you really. I wouldn‚Äôt tell. You had rules that you could sleep with others, so don‚Äôt tell her husband out of spite. They‚Äôll figure it out."

I know it‚Äôs hard to let go, but don‚Äôt let him have control over you. You‚Äôre young, focus on yourself and eventually you‚Äôll find someone who actually cares about you not just toys with you."
relationships,ew8p08q,t3_cnbp8a,1565212988.0,This girl is toxic. Don‚Äôt even give her the satisfaction of you responding. Sounds like she‚Äôs trying to get you jealous and make it harder for you to move on. Manipulative af. Block her and move on
relationships,ew8okse,t3_cnbs33,1565212802.0,What do you have to lose? You miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take. Narrow it down to 50%. Text her and ask her if she wants to do something fun like ice cream or anything you like. Trust me. It‚Äôs worth it
relationships,ew53p0x,t3_cmvwrb,1565126408.0,"I would end it. He sounds emotionally immature and if he sets a deadline in your relationship that‚Äôs a major red flag. Clearly he was commitment issues. My ex was like this, and though it lasted 3 years, we were always on and off and he cheated a lot. Don‚Äôt involve yourself in something that‚Äôs already so messy. You‚Äôre young and you deserve better"
relationships,ew537ps,t1_ew534ra,1565125983.0,"For the intern too, it is a lot easier and less intimidating to connect with someone who‚Äôs the similar age when new at a company. I‚Äôve been there."
relationships,ew534ra,t3_cmw4ri,1565125911.0,"It‚Äôs extremely normal for employees to chat, get coffee with, etc. interns. Interns need to socialize not just about work but gain a perspective on what life may be like at the company therefor it makes sense that they‚Äôre talking / going out to coffee. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the age difference. It‚Äôs 3 years, which is small and she‚Äôs not underage so that part shouldn‚Äôt bother you. It‚Äôs normal to be a little jealous, but it‚Äôs not something you need to fight him against. It sounds professional and he has told you about it so it‚Äôs not like he is hiding anything. Trust him. And if you don‚Äôt, there are bigger problems than him getting coffee with an intern/future colleague."
relationships,ew52u7z,t3_cmw4ro,1565125648.0,"Hi honey. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. It sounds a little irrational since he hasn‚Äôt done anything to lose your trust or similar nature. I think that when people are insecure single, it intensifies and complicates relationships when you‚Äôre seeing someone. Take some time to assure YOURSELF. you don‚Äôt need hiss reassurance or complements to change anything. This is within you. You should know you are enough, and if he is staying with you, he does love you. I know it can be tough not to get jealous if he follows some insta models, but he is a human being after all and has the right to find other women attractive - that doesn‚Äôt mean he wants them more or finds you less attractive! Be confident in yourself and the relationship, and things will fall into place. People come and go all the time, that‚Äôs how life works. Instead of living in fear, life with confidence in the present. He‚Äôs with you, he loves you. And if college changes that, then it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. The best thing to do is regain confidence in yourself."
