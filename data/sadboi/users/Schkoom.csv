depression,fbirc1f,t3_edhcd2,1576910840.0,"Yeah always feel like if I were to leave no one would stop me but if someone else were to leave they’d all either leave with them or beg them to stay. I hate it I feel unimportant and worthless to my friends. I always feel like the least important person on the room, I’m just expendable."
depression,fb4qdno,t1_fb4nbn8,1576513687.0,"It affects everyone differently, some feel more creative or more motivated to create something while depressed while others just go numb and lose their sense of self."

depression,fb3t2o8,t1_fb3sg1w,1576487599.0,"That’s exactly what I feel. I try to do creative stuff, I write or a draw but I just end up deleting it and telling myself I’m not creative or that what I made was stupid and meaningless."
depression,fb3mxor,t1_fb3mnar,1576479116.0,"I’ve just lost interest in my own life. Its not that I can’t make conversation with my friends I have in the past it’s just that I’m too drained. I’m usually very upbeat and outgoing and can make my friends laugh whenever, but I just haven’t felt like myself lately and it’s made it really hard for me. Thank you though, I’ll still use some of the ideas you’ve given me and hopefully it will help."

depression,fb3lfus,t3_eb5cwf,1576477369.0,"Yeah recently realized this, life is just going to shit and my body refuses to let me do anything about it. Thought I was doing alright for a while and then looked at my grades and the fact that I hardly talk to my friends anymore and realized it’s only gotten worse."
