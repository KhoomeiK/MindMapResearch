relationship_advice,f7m8snl,t3_dwxxd5,1573856946.0,"Oh boy this was me in the beginning of my relationship. So I can relate to this.

First of all congratulations on the new relationship! It seems like you guys are doing pretty well! 

Honestly, you learn to tone it down but has he said it's been too much? You both just started this relationship so that's completely normal (I'm still doing this and I've been with the dude for 7 months now). I think as the relationship continues on it'll start to mellow down. Shit, I'm still winding down and it's been 7, almost 8 months. If he hasn't complained, you're fine. Continue with hobbies, it's normal to miss him especially since you both have been hanging round all the time and just got into a relationship. 

As for the trust issues, I am the same way. If it gets bad, therapy is a good thing to resolve those trust issues. He's most definitely just busy with work or school or even forgets to send a reply, mine does that all the time and he has days where he sends one text due to needing a social recharge (that and military). Just give him time, he'll reply, just gotta be patient but you'll start to understand the groove of y'all's relationship. 

My guy told this to me whenever I'd panic and it's practically my mantra now: We will deal with it when we cross that bridge.

You learn to tame it it just takes time especially since the relationship is new for you"
