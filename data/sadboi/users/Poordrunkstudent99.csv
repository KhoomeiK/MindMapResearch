DevilMayCry,fptslnq,t3_gf7n0w,1588897429.0,"For the next game I think it’d be pretty cool if sparda became unsealed but being sealed alone with his overflowing demonic power and all those years with only his darkest thoughts had corrupted his mind. Making him an insane ‘big bad’ of the next entry in the series. Nero fighting against his grandfather and trying to reason with him like Vergil but failing due to him being completely corrupted and insane. As for a new character maybe a rejected bastard son of Mundas who completely hates everything demonic, including himself, and that’s what powers his strength. But frankly I don’t care what they do, as long as they don’t fuck up like dmc 2, I can put up with a not great story if the gameplay mechanics are good enough tbh, I won’t be happy about it but I’ll still enjoy the game.
