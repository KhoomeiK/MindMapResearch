aspergers,fjjm59q,t3_fdpyla,1583402960.0,"Wrt the fitness class, I think making an extreme comment like you hate the class in front of everyone has several negative effects.

- It distracts everyone else from the class itself and instead brings all attention to the complainer
- It generally brings everyone‚Äôs mood down so now their experience is more unpleasant than it had been before
- Publicly stating an extreme opinion encourages others to begin to share in that opinion. People are simply influenced by others
- Any negative criticism will inevitably end up being associated with the instructor, whether or not it was his/her fault.

And to me the most important thing is that there is completely no real benefit in declaring to everyone that she hates the class. So at best she‚Äôs disruptive and spoils the experience, and at worst she has bad intentions and is hatemongering."

SuicideWatch,feu3zon,t1_fetns2z,1579382916.0,"Separate comment because I want it to be clear that this is not specifically relating to this OP‚Äôs post. Some honest and non-rhetorical questions for you.

You talk about damage to people with low self esteem and feelings of being manipulative. Definitely possible, were that the case.

Consider a hypothetical selfish and mean asshole, who cares nothing about anyone else and always wants his way. When he finally meets someone with a backbone who refuses to give in to his unreasonable and completely selfish demands, he (sincerely) thinks himself the victim and he comes here seeking validation, misrepresenting others as unfair and needlessly picking on him.

Wouldn‚Äôt the wave of validation, and worse still, demonization of the other party, further entrench his shitty behavior, causing the problems to continue and worsen, except now he has a sense of sureness and smug moral superiority?

Wouldn‚Äôt it be better if he was able to change some small part of his behavior so how he is treated is, to some small extent, improved and his suffering reduced?

Or is it too great a risk for this subreddit, so the best course is to unconditionally support everyone‚Äôs view, right or wrong, and 100% refrain from challenging any of it?

In my view it will attract and retain the kind of people who only want attention and validation of their feelings regardless of suicidal tendencies. Do you feel this is a small, reasonable and necessary price to pay to avoid any risk of pushing someone to suicide?

And with no other examples given, I must consider the possibility that you actually do a lot of things ‚Äòwrong‚Äô.

About the coffee, your parents have a point. It sounds like they‚Äôre trying to avoid the possibility of having to argue with the hotel if the hotel insisted on charging for the coffee, which is a valid concern. You seem to think that it‚Äôll all be fine but that‚Äôs not a given. What you could‚Äôve done instead was say, ‚Äúoh yeah i didn‚Äôt think of that possibilty.

To make things worse, after they pointed out that you weren‚Äôt as careful as they are, your response was to fight back, ie refuse to fix the possible problem. What was wrong with calling hotel service back about the coffee? In my opinion, when your parents insisted on calling back, and you insisted that there was no need, you sound like the less reasonable party. 

...why couldn‚Äôt you just call back and clear a potential misunderstanding? Why, given the choice between 1) making a phone call and 2) resisting/fighting with your parents, you chose the latter? Is it because you have social anxiety and don‚Äôt want to call the staff too many times? Is it because you want to stand up for yourself and not follow your parents orders, for a sense of control? Is it because you don‚Äôt want to admit that you could‚Äôve done something better?

I have to reiterate that this is the only example I have to go on.
