Anxiety,fqbagmc,t3_ghiqy2,1589233426.0,"Oh my gosh, I have this same feeling so bad. I’m also really bad at interpreting things on social media. Recently I noticed a bunch of my fiancé’s friends stopped responding to anything I posted at all, when the majority of them were all pretty active on all of my posts. One friend was one of the reasons I loved posting because they always had something funny to say or just liked it regardless of what it was. They have since stopped liking anything at all and I can see when they’re online and being active allll the time.  I noticed that the same friends would still be “liking” and “commenting” and “sharing” on each other’s posts but it was like they all put me on snooze or something. It really tore me up. I was constantly checking my notifications, literally planning what to post and what to like and share, and I grew consumed with figuring out what they wanted to see in hopes that they would start liking my stuff again. 
Anytime I talked about it to my fiancé he would basically say it’s all in my head too and that I need to change the conversations in my head in regards to how I interpret people’s actions. For instance I even deleted one of the friends and immediately added them back after feeling childish. I since have deleted my Facebook all together and already feel better. 💜"

My right eyebrow is basically a giant scar. I woke up to my blood spurting all over the double yellow lines and that blood was stained there for months, almost a year. One of my front teeth was broken from the root and somehow shoved under my nose without leaving my mouth at all, so that’s been the biggest recovery. I was also 6 weeks pregnant. My insurance has already paid the settlement- the other driver was an undocumented driver whose out of state insurance expired literally 2 days prior to the accident- and now my fiancé and I are starting up a carpet cleaning business!"

PourPainting,fh8uor7,t1_fh79895,1581367746.0,"Thank you! I’ve been using lots of different brands to experiment with styles and such; this one in particular I used mainly DecoArt acrylic and some silicone drops. I find them all at Joann’s, Craft Warehouse, Michaels and anywhere that sells paints. 

However I used way too much silicone and now as all these are drying the silicone is literally coming off the painting!!Like I can swipe my hand over the tops and it’s wet. Sooo I definitely learned an important lesson! 

Also with this kind of painting it really is just a matter of practicing your preferred techniques, and don’t be shy to experiment! I’m trying new stuff all the time. I also try to do a lot of repurposing/recycling my materials, which really helps bring creative ways to make some awesome images!

You can of course add other things if you wanted to do a more complete ritual but I find I just do what comes naturally and let it end naturally. I’m definitely not a by-the-book witch. You do you, boo. 

One time after practicing blood runes, literally the very next day I received a magnificent piece of news I had been anxiously waiting for for MONTHS and it also resulted in me getting my fat settlement for getting hit by a car much faster.
