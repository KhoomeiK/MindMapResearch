I didn't even know how to name most of my feelings,.it just wasn't a thing.   Emotions were bottled up, a lot.  Difficult things were not discussed, probably because my parents didn't know how to discuss uncomfortable topics.

Emotions can be categorized two ways: Primary and secondary.  Secondary emotions manifest as a defensive mechanism to mask primary emotions.  The feeling you're describing, which is anger, is a secondary emotion.  This means that when someone is angry, they feel angry because they're actually feeling something else: threatened, scared, depressed, and ashamed are some common ones.  

So to manage anger in a healthy way,  I've had to practice identifying the emotion I was feeling that led to the anger, and then express and validate that.  It's a really difficult thing to do, and I'm still learning and practicing it.

To be quite honest, I haven't really been able to counteract the self hating thoughts, especially as they're happening.  What my therapist has told me to do is to write down whatever thought I'm having and then write evidence for and against the thought.  Something I've found a little more helpful is to make a list of things I genuinely like about myself (i.e. I'm empathetic, I'm introspective, hard-working)."
CPTSD,f9kk5tf,t3_e5kxke,1575402128.0,"I struggle with this too.  I think it's important to understand why you do it so you can find a way to help yourself that works.  

For me, I self sabotage for multiple reasons.  I isolate and don't care for myself properly because as a child, I found that isolation was the only way to cope with the overwhelmed-ness I felt and this was a behavior that has been ingrained in me for years.  Another reason I do (that I'm sure many people will relate to)  is because I hate myself and feel worthless, thus I self sabotage to reinforce the belief that I am worthless.  Another thing that I've recently discovered (in therapy) is that I self sabotage by placing myself in situations that I do not want to be in and refuse to communicate with people about how I'm feeling.  This is another learned behavior that stems from not having a need met.  

Based on the reasons above, I've been trying to tackle self sabotage by avoiding too much isolation, making sure I take care of myself with a self care checklist, try and counteract the negative beliefs I have about myself, and learn communication skills so that I can be assertive and not place myself in anxiety inducing situations.

I would imagine that everyone is different when it comes to this sort of thing, but I hope this can help a little."
