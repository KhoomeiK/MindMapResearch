Fortunately I found enough help with my chemical depression that I now get out of bed daily by 8am and I usually enjoy it.

Trying to deal with mental illness is like trying to heal a broken leg while still walking on it.  It‚Äôs not easy and it can be very painful.

After leaving the cult of mormonism and becoming agnostic I realized I was conditioned to always expect bad things to happen so I would feel a need to run back to the church.  
Finding that clarity helped me realize that I was just a random guy and there wasn‚Äôt someone trying to punish me, things just happen.  Now I don‚Äôt feel suspicious very often but when things are all going smoothly I do feel the law of averages is going to kick in and the roller coaster is about to go the other direction."
