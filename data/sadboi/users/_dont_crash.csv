And Im willing to bet a greater percent have lost coin during that time. So the trust isn't there but the greed is, as others have pointed out. Meaning the next shiny foolproof market is always around the corner. Best way to circumnavigate the issue is to have contact info for your favorite reputable vendors. Nobody reading this needs further explanation. Its easier, safer, and direct. No escrow but business relationships are built on trust and transparency. Even so, things happen.

Maybe the tendancies stem from some form of neglect or abandonment, possibly the loss of a parent. Whatever the reason just be strong and more importantly just be patient.

guineapigs,ffyh0ew,t1_ffycu2w,1580346214.0,"One freindly tip. One thing I found to save time, in your case the pellets, and for others the shavings, is to invest in a shop vac. A 12 to 16 gal because the hoses are large enough to not get stopped up. Craigslist, Letitgo, flea market, will run 50 bucks. Cuts cleaning time by 90% and you can dump it after a couple uses into contractor bag. Hepa filter included, and doubles as a blower. Can be used as a wet vac when filter removed."
guineapigs,ffyg1dz,t1_ffydo6s,1580345551.0,"Agreed. For some it's a bit of a drive but when you buy in bulk you can easily stock up for months in one go.

Cured my rabbit overnight when three seperate vets fell short. Told me it wouldnt work and to get her put down. It was an expensive lesson to the tune of 1500+.

It's important  that clients are comfortable dealing with you. And nobody feels comfortable when you can't get two words in because someone you just met acts like they've known you for life.
