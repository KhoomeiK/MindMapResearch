BPD,f9rsrqy,t3_e6ne8q,1575580774.0,"First, take a deep breath and remember the past is history and the future is a mystery, and living in the present is vital. I can completely relate to what you‚Äôre going through. Also an only child with BPD, I too have a constant fear of my parents dying, particularly my mother. To the point where I sometimes worry that if I buy concert tickets for the future, that she may not be around for the concert. I catastrophize and always expect the worst. 

I‚Äôve also hurt my mother with my alcoholism and self harm to the point where she had a breakdown. But here‚Äôs the thing. All of these things happened in my 20s and I persisted, I stuck with therapy, I took my meds, and I kept working. I‚Äôm now 32 and the hurt I‚Äôve caused my parents is a thing of the past. 

I still have my fears of losing my parents but it‚Äôs inevitable. It‚Äôs going to happen, death is a part of life. And when it finally does happen, you will get through it. You will, but the last thing you‚Äôll want to have is the regret that you spent your time with them worrying about losing them. Now is your chance to make every moment count. Know that your parents love you more than anything in this world and all they want is to see you happy. You deserve this. 

Side note - have you thought of dialectical behavior therapy? The skill set you‚Äôll learn in there I think could really help you. 

Good luck, friend. You‚Äôve got this."
