BarefootRunning,fmxuuul,t1_fmxomcu,1586472317.0,"The answer is the same with most things in PT, it depends. I wish I could say that you could confidently call any licensed podiatrist or PT in your area and have them be fully informed on why barefoot running can be good for you and how to introduce it to people who are new to it, or treat someone who has been performing it for a while. While I would not want to discourage you from seeking professional attention, I would also say that it is always a good idea to look at the background and credentials of someone you are asking to help you. It usually doesn't hurt to send an email or call to talk during some down time. These days, you have your pick of pretty much any PT that can do telehealth! 

Many PT's that I know will go for forefoot/lower leg exercises before referring someone to get orthotics or generally passive treatments, even if they don't have a strong background in barefoot running. 
If you are an active person without many chronic health conditions who prefers barefoot/minimalist running but you are experiencing pain, I would want to treat the impairments with customized stretching/strengthening exercises, look at running form, talk about running terrain, time/mileage, and other variables before telling someone that orthotics and the shoes that come with them are their new reality."
BarefootRunning,fmxlmgk,t1_fmwo4wi,1586467294.0,"A fair amount of the profession understands barefoot running concepts, but it is hard to integrate it uniformly. As example, at CSM (PT convention) a few years back there was a debate on forefoot/hindfoot striking and barefoot running style. Much of the issue is that the demand for PT largely comes from those who wouldn't be appropriate for barefoot running style, such as folks with diabetic neuropathy who couldn't feel their feet well enough, or those with disability/deformity who are unlikely to adapt as expected. 

The biggest issue I have found is that people who run don't often like being told how to run or what shoes to buy/not buy unless it is their idea, but they come to PT because something hurts, so it takes a fair amount of buy-in before that can become part of the plan."
malementalhealth,flrrm67,t3_fqep0n,1585426378.0,"You've had some great responses that appear generally based on reframing your thoughts, so I feel like offering another strategy that may help you in your efforts to calm the storm. 

>This has left me feeling always tightly wound and angry. I cant relax at home and im only happy when im at work or doing something completely seperate from usual family commitments.

Not everything is fixed with exercise, but I find that anger and anxiety do really well with a bit of it. Even a walk around the block, cursing to yourself the whole way, or listening to cathartic energetic music can help. A regular routine with elements of cardiovascular exercise and resistance training is generally optimal for us. 

What is your exercise routine, if any? How much time is it taking you? 

Keep in mind, as you say you are a 19 y/o male. You are still swimming in testosterone and energy, and your prefrontal cortex that tells you to behave is not 100% developed yet. It's understandable to have these reactions, and the best thing you can do is ""sabotage the sabotage"", and proactively plan to approach this from multiple angles. If you start a routine up, it may give you some solace. You may find that these things upset you, but that you are able to deal with it better when you have healthy coping strategies, or they simply don't rile you up so much."
DisneyMusic,fllkj3h,t3_fpk655,1585262154.0,"Consider looking at other acts like Jonathan Young for inspiration. He started with Disney covers and has branched out to Anime and pop culture. His schtick is that instead of covering the songs faithfully, he does a heavy metal version of it. 

If I had to guess, he likes heavy metal and disney and wanted to smush them together and maybe he thought nobody else had done it right, so he just did it himself. 

You don't have to ask what we want. Look for what twist you can add to it. 

Not sure what your twist is? First look at what's out there. Watch Disney covers, and see what people are making. Don't let yourself get intimidated. If you find an established artist that you admire, look at some of their first few videos or how they work to bring them down to a more ""possible for me to do"" level. Once you do this browsing, you'll get ideas on how they could make their videos better or differently, and then you will decide to do it.

If you want to hang out with him and not involve wife, that's fine. If this has been going on for 5 years and everybody's fine with it only being sexual, I see no problem, you all seem to get along fine.   


Well, one potential issue that could come up is that while you can't assess if your wife isn't sleeping with other people, you have even less ability to assess if your buddy is. Your buddy might catch something from a partner of his and spread it to you two unless you use appropriate protection."
