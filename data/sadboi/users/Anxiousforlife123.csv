cdifficile,fpoc318,t3_gemigj,1588781964.0,I’m newly not infected since December and haven’t needed antibiotics since then but I’ve seen other take vanco along with the oral antibiotic and that helped prevent reinfection.

catpictures,fpi3t7u,t1_fpi3qci,1588633109.0,Thank you! I got it at Petsmart. Tomorrow is her birthday so this was her gift.
cdifficile,fndqa45,t1_fncy989,1586875435.0,"No problem! And yeah, the relapse thing is terrifying. I constantly worry. And I know we can relapse anytime if we take an antibiotic again. But not sure about other ways. I know some people are carriers and it stays dormant in their system and can reactivate. I get frustrated because I feel like a lot of doctors don’t even understand it and can’t give good advice. And the food thing?  Infuriating. I miss my good home cooking and wide variety of meals. Now I have to cook two meals because I eat the same things daily but have a son and I’m not gonna make him eat the same thing everyday. And my insurance will not cover FMT and I don’t have a way to pay for it if I ever needed one so I understand your concern on that aspect. What country are you in? If you don’t mind me asking. Hopefully you never get it back and will never need an FMT."
hemorrhoid,fnc5emt,t1_fna88ov,1586828990.0,"What kind of aspercreme do you use? I agree, preparation H is junk. I use witch hazel and it helps but I’m tired of pain and all the blood everytime I go every day. And do you apply it just like prep H?"
cdifficile,fnc3o8t,t1_fna2yre,1586827944.0,"Yes this past November/December. Introducing new food slowly just means I eat one new food every few days. That way I know which food caused the issue. And I can’t do lactose free yogurt or it causes me issues, I do eat coconut milk yogurt and have no issues. I eat a lot of chicken, rice, eggs, toast, crackers, ground turkey, turkey breast, higher quality turkey lunch meat, turkey bacon, crackers, miso soup, zucchini, carrots, green beans, peas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, home made chicken soup, avocado, rice milk, rice Chex cereal, plain cheerios. And recently introduced good quality dark chocolate. But Tonight I tried 3 cheesy pretzels and instantly had to run to the bathroom and now I have pain. So I wrote it down as not safe. I keep a bit of a food journal and when I try something new I write it down and wait 24 hours and usually by then I’ll have a reaction and know whether it’s safe or not and write safe or unsafe next to it. I try very hard to not try two new foods together or on the same day. Every other day is usually the closest I’ll eat two new foods. It’s worked well for me. It’s slow and frustrating and I’m tired of it but it’s how I deal with it. And yeah, I do believe some of the reactions are from not eating things for so long and our bodies have to learn how to digest them again. I have BAD anxiety and panic, it 100% triggers my IBS. I’ve had anxiety 13 years and IBS 13 years. They definitely go hand in hand. I also take CBD oil and culturelle probiotics and they both help my IBS and the CBD oil helps my anxiety."
cdifficile,fna203u,t3_g0ioq3,1586789480.0,"I did one round of vanco from November 27-December 7th. My stomach is very hit or miss. BUT one thing I suggest is asking your doctor about a medicine called cholestyramine. It doesn’t necessarily help the other stuff but it helps *tremendously* with diarrhea. I stay away from dairy but eat other stuff. I don’t do spicy, fatty, greasy, or red meats. I’m slowly introducing dairy back in. As in VERY slowly. I do still get some pain and gurgling but that’s my IBS. I had it before c diff and now it’s worse but I’m getting to know it more. One veggie that has treated me well is zucchini, it’s mostly water so digests well. I can’t tell you if anyone goes Back to normal but I can say, we hear more from the 30% that relapse or have issues after because people who beat it and don’t relapse or have issues after go back to normal life without having to join a group on reddit or Facebook. Only the ones who live with daily issues are gonna get on these things with their stories. Best of luck and ask about that medicine!"
Cooking,fmwk46g,t1_fmwibjd,1586448009.0,I said No to the stock but also have an opened jar of Better Than Boullion in the but says January 2020. Ugh I wonder if that ok to use 🤔
Cooking,fmwj9fa,t1_fmwiffo,1586447576.0,Thanks! Gonna go with the smell and look test.
Cooking,fmwj7t7,t1_fmwibjd,1586447554.0,Thanks! This was kind of my idea too. Just needed the reassurance I guess lol
cdifficile,fmr2yo2,t1_fmq3l03,1586312661.0,Good luck! Hope it all works out for you.
airfryer,fmgt16c,t1_fmgmlci,1586057057.0,"I love my insta vortex!! And I’d agree, some things cook so fast. Except I lost all four of my rubber feet which annoyed me. My mom visited and thought they weren’t supposed to be on there and threw them away 😩"
cdifficile,fm2zp6n,t1_fm2p815,1585709248.0,Raster is completely knowledgeable. I just came to say pretty much what she did. And to add that I didn’t show c diff symptoms until 3 weeks after my antibiotic. But my doctor said they can take as long as 12 weeks after finishing them to show up. So just be very careful. Maybe try and find someone who hasn’t had any meds in at least 6 months.
cdifficile,fm2llje,t3_fsnrc1,1585700001.0,GoodRX has a discount code for vanco. My insurance wouldn’t pay and it was $993 out of pocket. With that coupon it was $143. Also I’ve heard if you can find a compound pharmacy and get the liquid vanco it’s like less than $50. Be careful with using a person who had had antibiotics within the last 6 months. They could give you c diff even if they don’t have it because their own gut flora is compromised at this point.
Catswithjobs,fke040a,t1_fkdjtww,1584101436.0,Thanks! I love her and the spice rack lol. Her more of course.
Catswithjobs,fkciwut,t1_fkc812h,1584054042.0,"Actually, it is. I wondered also but they come right out surprisingly."
Catswithjobs,fkbyrzq,t1_fkbr2qf,1584042465.0,Lol!! Her catnip is kept safe in another area. But she probably did check just to make sure I wasn’t using her supply for my cooking 🤣
cdifficile,fjlkmcq,t1_fjljgdi,1583448455.0,"All I said to him was to keep an eye on it and to make sure to go to the doctor if it gets worse. I didn’t badger him lol. And the others I just told them it’s contagious and an evil illness. So I didn’t go completely postal or anything. And yeah, I’m very aware of all germs and poop 😂"
cdifficile,fjldurv,t1_fjlda8r,1583444920.0,Yes and no. Lol. I only am nervous because I know I’m way more susceptible to getting it again than anyone else in the office.
cdifficile,fjl5dee,t1_fjl31np,1583440243.0,I got mine from clindamycin too. And I’m calmer now. Had a mini panic and now I’m good. Just gotta wash hands and not touch my mouth. It wouldn’t scare me as much if I weren’t so newly free of it. So I know my gut still isn’t healed or microbiome isn’t built back up yet.
CBDOilReviews,fjgicfz,t1_fjgfhtg,1583327458.0,No problem!!
CBDOilReviews,fjge846,t1_fjgcwav,1583323766.0,"I looked at one that said terpenes in a report. I don’t know how to post pictures on here tho. [terpene results](https://doc-0k-90-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/634rjge8qjqp5bbbjofqkmidvjl5oqg6/l2hmpid390r4797n3hcjgiae7hl8isaf/1583323650000/09314078248617799782/17941705160775585107/1WvryVgRtKSpH_LtuMwRs6VDXvUnLc8ZC?e=download&authuser=0&nonce=493gqho7h7eus&user=17941705160775585107&hash=h4fj4bnl13cekvbqqvaqusad73g98i1f) 

If you scroll all that way to the bottom is has terpene results. I believe. Or if you go to the site is full spectrum and go to lab results tab close to the bottom and click the 1000mg it shows. It’s limonene at 83% and the rest are lower 2-3%."
CBDOilReviews,fjgcp1v,t1_fjg8ql6,1583322130.0,I believe so. They have lab results and everything on their site.
CBDOilReviews,fjgcmxe,t1_fjfqh9n,1583322064.0,Awesome. I’m glad to hear. I’ve read good things about the company. I have been taking a different CBD brand for about two years and it’s not working as well so figured I’d give a new one a try! Glad I went with this one.
Anxiety,fje8dpd,t1_fje78a6,1583267018.0,I take two 15 mg capsules. One in the AM and one at lunch. I take one called +CBD oil. And I also have a tincture that I take when needed by BioMD+. I had to play around with it quite a bit to find my right brand a dosage. The first few I tried didn’t do anything. And I took each for 2-3 weeks before deciding if it worked or not. And I only bought from reputable places that showed their labs. I don’t buy from vape shops or gas stations or any of that stuff.
Anxiety,fje6eru,t1_fje2bw8,1583266123.0,I take CBD oil also. It helps me more than any of the prescriptions I’ve tried over the years.
Anxiety,fje226o,t3_fczwli,1583263706.0,Personally the Valium didn’t help my high anxiety much at all. All it did was make me feel high and like my head was 100 pounds. And I couldn’t think straight.
CBDOilReviews,fje0f0k,t1_fjdvdbz,1583262776.0,Oh ok. Thank you for that explanation. False advertisement isn’t cool. I already ordered tho so hopefully it at least helps in the areas I need it.
CBDOilReviews,fje0akg,t1_fjduaoi,1583262707.0,I ordered two bottles of the citrus full spectrum. One for me to try for sleep and anxiety and one for my uncle who has pain. Hoping to have good luck for us both!
CBDOilReviews,fjdi6c4,t1_fjdctnm,1583253168.0,Can you explain further for me? Which brand would you recommend?
CBDOilReviews,fjczujy,t3_f8heid,1583242016.0,I just placed my first order with them!! Hoping it helps my higher anxiety. 🤞
Anxiety,fj6gwik,t1_fj5jwpi,1583071546.0,Worked pretty quickly but full effect took about a week.
Anxiety,fi51354,t1_fi4xbfa,1582152620.0,It gave me chest pain. Which I found is only present in less than 1% of people who take it. Yay me.
ibs,fi254pq,t1_fi22h8o,1582071682.0,It’s not super painful. More of an annoyance with some pain. I went to the dr yesterday. Not helpful.  But I took a stool sample in so we will see.
ibs,fi1tukw,t1_fi1qnw5,1582064666.0,"That’s good to know. Sometimes it hurts into my kidney area and side but UGH. I’m over it. Going on two weeks. I’m gonna try the heating pad tonight and see if it helps. The lower left pain is so much easier for me to dismiss as IBS lol. Plus with the infection I had, everything is scary that involves the colon."
ibs,fi1omsi,t1_fi1nyww,1582061773.0,"Well since my infection I really can do far only tolerate organic chicken breast, rice, potatoes, oatmeal,rice crackers,plain gluten free noodles, green beans. That almost my entire diet currently. Sadly. But last weekend I tried butternut squash, zucchini,yellow squash, two bites of fruit smoothie, and a bag of baked lays chips. And it started the next day. But with the infection I had, it’s hard to tell. I don’t have pain on the top, mainly just the right so I thought maybe the ascending colon?I turned in a stool sample today for bacteria,parasites,and viruses. Just waiting on a call from that. Sadly the dr I had to see was not my regular and was NOT thorough at all. Wasn’t even gonna check on my stomach pain until I asked him too. And just said, could be ibs, could be a bug, could be a reoccurrence of my Infection. Not very helpful. Sorry you didn’t ask for any of that. Lol I rambled."
Anxiety,fhyazlu,t1_fhy9g4c,1581972252.0,I wanna day within a few days. I unfortunately ended up having a side effect and they made me get off of it. But it worked wonders for me. I’d say it took a week at the longest. I took it three times a day.
Anxiety,fhy957y,t3_f5f0de,1581971181.0,It was the only anxiety medicine that has ever worked for me. I’ve tried MANY.
Marijuana,fhtc3q3,t1_fht3xdd,1581873057.0,Seems easy! I’ll have to look into it thanks!
Marijuana,fht3i8y,t1_fhsqtk1,1581869547.0,Nice! I don’t know how to do all that.
Anxiety,fhoqwh7,t3_f48sgl,1581770280.0,I’ve had this since October and it is very crippling. The constant feeling of being dizzy or unsteady. Or feeling like I’m gonna suddenly fall over or pass out. Even just sitting on the couch. I’ve kind of just gotten used to it. My therapist says it may just be my new normal. Well this normal sucks! I’m sorry you’re going thru it. Hope it gets better for you!
cdifficile,fhnl3df,t1_fhnkql3,1581728308.0,"Thanks. The cramps and soft stools going away would also ease my mind! I know she will request a stool test so that at least reassuring. PTSD from c diff is real! And yeah, stress can for sure make everything worse. I’ve had anxiety for like 10 years and it’s been thrown into overdrive the last few months. Therapy helps and meditation and walking daily. But nothing take it completely away. I should try the Valium but now scared to put any medicine into my body."
CBD,fhiyvi7,t1_fhiyjx9,1581634633.0,Lol will do. Probably won’t be for a little bit but I’ll for sure let everyone know!
CBD,fhiydw7,t1_fhix3jy,1581634338.0,I’m for sure going to order at least one and see if I like it!
airfryer,fhg7zw1,t3_f32b7y,1581560680.0,"I’ve had this happen. I now spritz oil on the chicken while it cooks. And I flip more than once usually. So everytime I flip, I spritz."
CBDOilReviews,fhg0u08,t1_fhftlq8,1581555934.0,"No,I know! I was saying they responded to mine but I didn’t ask the vitamin e question. So maybe it did it did have vitamin e and they didn’t wanna say it. But since I didn’t ask that they answered me. No need to get offensive. I knew what you meant. I was at work and just read and typed fast to respond."
Anxiety,fhfeuox,t3_f2y4uu,1581541974.0,I have this feeling about my job. Frustrating because I don’t even dislike my job. But had a panic attack there in October and hate it there now.
Anxiety,fhfe9im,t1_fhfe4ia,1581541637.0,I’m sorry you feel this way. Just know you’re not alone and I also am going thru it. I wish anxiety and panic didn’t exist. It’s made my depression so bad that I struggle to get out of bed and go to work.
Anxiety,fhfe30w,t1_fhfdz3s,1581541535.0,Yep. I say that October 18th messed my life up. I’m just in a constant state of anxiety and panic. It’s depressing and frustrating.
Anxiety,fhfdwtd,t3_f2xye4,1581541438.0,I have this since a panic attack I had in October.

CBD,fhclvl3,t1_fhcjs5h,1581465661.0,Yeah I plan to do that for sure. I’ll probably try the vape in the AM and throughout the day and that at night. I just need something to help the panic and anxiety
CBD,fhc8z8p,t1_fhc4ot9,1581458605.0,Did smoking the CBD make you feel a certain way? Like high at all? Or is it more of a natural calmness?
CBD,fhc23vw,t1_fhc1r2u,1581454659.0,I found a vape that does dry flower as well as cartridges so I may get that and give it a go. I just have horrible reactions to THC so I always am weird about smoking. Always scared it’ll do the same thing 🤦🏻‍♀️
CBD,fhc1cco,t1_fhbzd73,1581454224.0,Thanks!! I’m gonna try 2-3 companies and see which works best for my anxiety. They are one of them.
CBD,fhc1aey,t1_fhbzt1m,1581454193.0,Thanks! I’ve never done the flower. I always took capsules but found they just aren’t working for my anxiety anymore. Someone suggested vaping or smoking. Smoking I’ve never done so I was apprehensive
Marijuana,fh7hvrr,t1_fh6ydtm,1581332662.0,Thanks. That’s what I’m thinking also. Anxiety and panic are so awful. Hard to handle. Willing to try almost anything at this point.

Marijuana,fh649bq,t1_fh6132z,1581295046.0,I do take 30mg of CBD a day and it used to help but unfortunately I had. A panic attack in October and my anxiety and panic disorder is at an all time high. I need relief and had benzos. Do you have any advice on micro dosing? What’s the best avenue or way is?

cats,fge5zj7,t3_exyptj,1580692129.0,"Feed wet food while your sitting sideways,not facing her and just talk while she eats. A normal voice and maybe even just read out loud while she eats.

bettafish,fg0ln4n,t1_fg0hs73,1580410280.0,Good idea. I’ll for sure do that. I’m not gonna add a betta until I find the perfect one. I’m ok with waiting it out for the right one.
bettafish,fg0e5wl,t1_fg0cdv2,1580405911.0,"Thank you! I’ll be doing a 10-20 gallon tank I think. My local petco is having a $1 a gallon sale currently. 

My current 30 gallon cichlid tank has sand and I love it but didn’t know if bettas could use it. 

I plan to do live plants but could change to silk if that doesn’t work out. 

I’ve owned Bettas in the past and they’ve always been a favorite for me. My son may end up with a 5 gallon in his room as well. 

I was thinking shrimp also but didn’t know if it was best. Glad I asked here!"
