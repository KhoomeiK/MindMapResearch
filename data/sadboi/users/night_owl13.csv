Horoscope,fn97lwi,t3_g08242,1586762262.0,"People change and sorry to say, friendships will fade. A life long friend is a very rare thing. Aries can be impulsive and reckless and Scorpio can be reticent or appear to be withholding but a person is also much more than their sun sign alone. You might simply have learned all you needed to (spiritually speaking) from this person and it's time to move on to new relationships. 7 years is a long time and you both will have grown and changed. Sounds like both you and  she have been thinking about your friendship for awhile and it might be time to either change the context of the relationship or to let it go. If you arent enhancing each other, you're draining each other. Don't discount however that grief makes people crazy, she may be lashing out in pain.

I will say, creating the narrative that you ""dont click"" with Aries will only close you off in the future; you believe it so it become true. Dont forget that everyone has all signs represented in their chart, to reject any one of them outright does you a disservice. Check out the house aries rules in your chart. How could that area of your life be impacted by you channeling more aries energy? Remember, Aries and Scorpio share a ruling planet after all!"

They tried to cram a lot of elements from similar games into one and it doesn't always work. That, with the odd scripting choices (and occasional bad translations) and overwhelming amount of stuff to do, can feel unfinished. THAT BEING SAID, I bought it on sale and at that price I think I got my money's worth at 40ish hours, probably more to come. I like the world, sort of a post-apocalypse misapprehension experience.

His brother though, is yellowing and losing leaves every day, especially the middle vine. The plant is also still producing new leaves...

I've had it for about two years and up until a few weeks ago it was a happy little plant, pushing out leaves all year long. I rarely water it as every time I do it freaks out, even with small amounts of water I always end up with a leaf of two yellowing and falling off the next day. Because it's been winter, I've been watering maaaybe once a month or every three weeks or so. He gets bone dry but seems happy that way for the most part. I gave him a little bit of water with a some general Miracle Gro indoor plant fertilizer (rookie mistake?) about a week and a half ago and it's been ailing ever since. 

The plant was repotted into its current vessel back in August. The pot is plenty deep and wide with drainage. He is in room with northern/westerly bright indirect (it will catch a few later afternoon rays). What should I do? Can he bounce back?"
