More expensive also does not equate to automatically better.

If you visit head-fi, there are overehelming amounts of positive reviews of DAVE, probably one of the most thread pages for any DAC out there currently and it is for good reason.

At the end of the day you have to listen with it yourself and decide for yourself if you feel it is worthwhile.

As long as you are enjoying your music, you are ""missing"" nothing. If you happen to want to upgrade, try the component yourself if possible and decide for yourself. Can not stress that enough. 

Can Jam events held yearly at different locations can be a decent place to try but the surrounding noises can be tough. If unable to test in person, reading threads and other peoples opinions only gets you so much as no one wants to admit they overspent and that it's not ""worth it.""

ADI 2 is a great option
Benchmark DAC 3 B is also a great option

My preference would be DAC 3 B over ADI 2 for things like build quality, stackable with the popular hpa4 amp (great amp) and small foot print.

ADI 2 strong points are its extensive EQ ability but I tend to dislike messing with EQ.

As you pay up in price past a certain point diminishing returns sets in heavy and it will never make you feel it's worth it from a logical stand point. Logically one can argue after taking off the headphones, your wallet is still dented and hurting.

My current fave song is summer days (vintage culture) by martin garrix."
headphones,fnue43c,t1_fnue1xs,1587260045.0,Ah gotcha. Yeah cables have a very polarized community. It is either full on belief or non belief so I tend not to get into it. Regardless of its effects or non effects I did rank them dead last and as an optional item.
headphones,fnue15o,t1_fnudndc,1587259995.0,"I used to play saxophone in middle school. Maybe you will enjoy the group piano guys. They are a cool group who throw a modern twist on classical music. 

As for jazz, do not listen to much myself, welcome suggestions though!"
headphones,fnudt7p,t1_fnudc0f,1587259868.0,I wasn't arguing with you. As mentioned I put it last as I see that as an optional item.
headphones,fnudakt,t1_fnud6zi,1587259567.0,"Spotify actually has the best song reccomendation engine based on what songs you listen to. 

Do you listen to EDM?

Check out Gummy by Loud Luxury."
headphones,fnucuv0,t1_fnucrx0,1587259313.0,I put them last in ranking due to ymmv. They are optional.

To get most bang for buck or to save money, I would spend most to all of the budget on Headphones/AMP/DAC with high emphasis on Headphones/AMP. Everything else in my opinion has high diminishing returns but at the same time the improvements are noticeable.

I started almost a decade ago with the HD600 plus the Schitt stack and was equally happy then compared to now. I love music.

Despite the general thought of speakers being better, I found that speakers having to deal with not so ideal room acoustics to be a huge nuisance. 

I also started my journey via headphones so I have a soft spot for them. Cherry on top with headphones is no wife or girlfriend to tell me to turn the music down."
headphones,fnuaz1i,t3_g3ypcs,1587258203.0,"From my own journey/experience, order of importance seemed to be:

1. Headphones
2. AMP
3. DAC
4. Upscaler
5. Server
6. Cables (Optional, YMMV)

Happy listening, be safe over the weekend!"

Some light observations during my journey of upgrading components in rank of importance:

1. Headphones
2. AMP
3. DAC
4. Hugo M Scaler
5. Server/Streamer
6. Cables (Optional, High Diminishing Returns)

Be safe out there, happy listening!"
AskMenOver30,fnrsptc,t3_g3g86n,1587200109.0,"I suggest having them doing activities together as much as you can so they share childhood memories together and indirectly bang it hard that they should have each others backs.

For example, buy a cookie and break it in half and ask one to choose who gets the bigger half and if they give wrong answer (giving themself bigger half) then crumble the cookie down to  smaller 2 pieces and re ask question again. If they are stubborn, then keep crushing the cookie down to essentially ""nothing""

Change the question back and forth amongst the brothers until they get the answer right. 
and explain why they need to have each others backs and what kindness means and that its better to have a win win than a lose lose. 

When they age they will remember this lesson from their father for life and remember that memory forever. 

Perhaps do this when they are little older, do not feel bad to crumble cookie all the way down. Good luck, be a man, crumble that cookie."
