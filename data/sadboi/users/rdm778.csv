It looks like a regular tree, but the¬†Manchineel can kill you. Everything about it is extremely toxic. If¬†you¬†touch its leaves, they¬†will¬†cause ""a strong allergic dermatitis."" It's so bad that, if¬†you¬†stay under its foliage while it's raining, the water¬†will¬†cause instant blistering wherever it touches¬†you.

You can't burn the Manchineel's wood because the smoke will cause temporary and even permanent blindness. And if you eat one of its apples, you can die. Although there's no modern medicine records on any fatalities, there are mentions of deaths in historic records. In fact, Christopher Columbus named it ""manzanita de la muerte"" or¬†little apple of death¬†for that reason.¬†The poisoning symptoms are horrible:

Ingestion may produce severe gastroenteritis with bleeding, shock, bacterial superinfection, and the potential for airway compromise due to edema. Patients with a history of ingestion and either oropharyngeal burns or gastrointestinal symptoms should be evaluated for admission in hospital."

Drugs,fmnsdd2,t1_fmndauu,1586233939.0," [Ibogaine](https://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v6/n5/full/tp201671a.html) is a psychoactive drug that induces hallucinogenic effects like those associated with the use of LSD or psilocybin. While the drug can lead to some short-term side effects, including anxiety after experiencing hallucinations, it has been touted for a few years as a potential solution to devastating addiction problems. 

 The addiction model of disease describes the condition as chronic due to long-term changes to the reward centers of the brain. When a person takes ibogaine, the drug is converted into a compound called *noribogaine*, which targets the areas of the brain affected by drug-seeking and addictive behaviors. Noribogaine ‚Äúrewires‚Äù these areas, allowing the brain to restructure itself to a state similar to before addiction was triggered.

While ibogaine can, for many, ease withdrawal and prevent cravings, that process is more like detox than ending an addiction. There are still steps to be taken after a person no longer physically needs or seeks out substances to abuse.

## Success Rates

Medical professionals who have used [ibogaine to treat people recovering from methamphetamine](https://www.academia.edu/1691328/Ibogaine_and_methamphetamine_A_review_of_the_available_literature_and_treatment_experiences) addiction report **50-80 percent success rates**; however, long-term recovery and relapse avoidance depend largely on entering a rehabilitation program after taking ibogaine with a doctor‚Äôs supervision."
