weather,fovw2pb,t1_fovvla1,1588108530.0,Hatched refers to the lines they draw. Google hatched lines and you’ll see what it refers to. When it shows up on one of these maps it’s an area with a bunch of black dashes through it. Apparently it comes from a French word.

The highest dose I got was only 40mg though. This may not be the medicine for you. The good news is the akathisia (slowly) went away for me over time after I stopped. There are also other meds that help with akathisia if you want to stay on Latuda. Good luck <3"

BipolarReddit,fmv80se,t3_fxg08l,1586408577.0,I used to get deja vu all the time in middle and high school. I also hated the sensation and it would make me quite anxious. I was later diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and I wonder if the two are connected. I’m not suggesting you have a dissociative disorder but I wonder if it is actually a form of mild dissociation. Medication really got rid of my dissociation and anxiety. Now if only I could get a handle on the bipolar part!

bipolar2,ewilrry,t3_coinr1,1565451984.0,"As far as I know, irritability and anger are very common in bipolar disorder. You’re not alone =) 

There are medicines that are supposed to help with anger. If you’ve been in therapy for a long time and can’t get a handle on it, maybe ask your psychiatrist if there’s anything that can help specifically with anger now that your moods are okay. I wouldn’t recommend medicine as the first choice for anything but if you’re not able to control it, you may need this to help you. 

My main worry is physically hurting yourself. I know how it feels, sometimes I get so angry I just start punching myself or whatever inanimate object is near me. It’s like I can’t feel better unless I destroy something. Maybe you need to try a different approach in therapy to help deal with anger in the moment? I’m sorry, I don’t have all the answers but I hope you can find something that works out for you. There’s things you can do at home like punch a pillow or rip up a bunch of paper but you may not have that option when you’re in a car or at work or most other social situations. 

I’m wishing you the best in your journey =)"

insanepeoplefacebook,ewfjg4r,t1_ewfh82q,1565362208.0,It doesn’t make you a hypocrite to not get up and search because they just want you to be on the lookout for a specific car and/or person. You could grumble and just try to go back to sleep... or you can complain publicly that a child going missing interrupted your sleep and yell about virtue signaling or whatever.

religiousfruitcake,evyiro8,t3_clx5ei,1564933620.0,"Why would a pastor tell a woman to treat her husband like Jesus himself? She’s supposed to literally worship him? Isn’t that sacrilege? And I doubt he would give the same advice to a man in the woman’s position. 

Also, the tactic of “worship your abuser” wouldn’t work most of the time anyway. They’d still find things to abuse you over and blame you for. They want control. They see you as a physical and/or emotional punching bag. You could be the nicest and most agreeable punching bag in the world, you’re still gonna get punched eventually."

bipolar,euf9fvb,t3_cfz55z,1563766509.0,"I mean, I get the sentiment. But it’s not like people believe you that much when you’re very clearly not functioning at all. They just say different things like telling you you’re just being lazy and need to pull yourself out of it. I’m finally recovering after a very severe depression episode (thanks bipolar disorder) and even after watching me basically fail out of college this semester and completely isolate myself and self harm resulting in hospitalization, my parents don’t really seem to get that it’s a Mental Illness and I can’t just Get Better by going “Oh, I guess I shouldn’t be suicidal and depressed”. People really have very little compassion for mentally ill people regardless of how well they’re functioning and it’s all awful."

He was about a month shy of being 13 years old."
