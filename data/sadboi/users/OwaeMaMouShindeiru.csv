2) Had you not considered that my previous relationships had ended because I am unwavering in not wanting children?

Selfishness is expecting people to become parents against their interests and not respecting their choice to remain child-free. Selfishness is also imposing life on someone who has to grow up in such an intolerant and unpleasant world like this one."

childfree,f3p620y,t3_dhiur7,1571045672.0,Brilliant!
GalaxyNote8,f2zyobe,t1_f2qqblh,1570542192.0,What were the terms of the lifetime warranty? Lifetime can be limited to a single component or part's MTBF. I had screen burn on my Note 8 and Samsung replaced the screen and battery under warranty without any pushback.
childfree,f2zohs2,t3_derfnk,1570532803.0,Good on you taking ownership of your life with the salpingectomy. So what if they didn't want kids at the same age? That's hardly a benchmark setting you up to want kids later.
SuggestALaptop,f26lpp8,t1_f26c44z,1570015970.0,"Never? No, just no. For those who want peace of mind from a retailer or manufacturer supporting them if something is wrong with the memory or system, advising only to buy used is terrible. Your last sentence makes no sense. Did you miss a word or two or use the wrong one?"
SuggestALaptop,f1zewpx,t3_db7l3h,1569842584.0,Finding a spare parts page may help.
SuggestALaptop,f1z2aab,t1_f1nuzly,1569831313.0,I'm not sure if a fresh install would make a difference but the Gigabyte software could be configured to work with specific settings on the laptop so the advice to do a fresh installation could have merit.
antinatalism,f1wduy1,t1_f1ttf46,1569783524.0,"Is that your standard answer to people dealing with grief or a mental health problem for example? Without understanding people's circumstances, that rhetoric is naive at best, insensitive, callous and ignorant at worst."
SuggestALaptop,f1n8rq3,t1_f1n5yk2,1569611577.0,"Perhaps you should run it stock first and determine if you think it runs too hot before deciding to undervolt? With this ""somewhere"" you read about undervolting was that specific to the Aero 15 or another laptop with the same CPU? One undervolting setting could be ineffective or actually cause instability between the same CPU model but on different system because of a differing BIOS or hardware. 
If you're not hugely familiar with undervolting, you might want to ask if you should do it instead of asking if you could do it."
SuggestALaptop,f1n2eoo,t1_f1mq4sb,1569607416.0,"With RAM, it's already running dual-channel so you'd be replacing rather than adding. The underside panel is easy to remove compared to some other laptops of similar specification. Undervolting reduces your CPU and memory performance for the sake of prolonging battery life. You'd do that through the BIOS but may I ask why you wish you would contemplate doing it? The 90Wh battery will last you from 5-7 hours on a very good day."
SuggestALaptop,f1mnryo,t3_da1n4i,1569598141.0,"It's definitely good for both.
It's a proper powerhouse with a decent amount of I/O ports. Upgrading the RAM and adding a second SSD are really easy and the battery life is excellent for such a powerful laptop. 
The adapter is heavy and bulky so you need to bear that in mind if you travel and plan to use it for more than a couple of hours.
The keyboard does take some getting accustomed to compared to other laptop keyboards I've used though. 
Which screen are you looking at? The 4K screen doesn't run at 144Hz unlike the 1080p screen if you're after a high frame rate."
antinatalism,f1m4m1w,t1_f1m3l6r,1569584022.0,"And then you're the bad guy for pointing out that by that rationale, their child could be the next tyrant, serial killer or paedophile kingpin."
antinatalism,f1hf4hf,t1_f1h9uds,1569492110.0,I'm surprised you can't work it out. Surely the OP is questioning why someone would have children only to put them at  the mercy of a landlord when they're 18?
antinatalism,f1f3yoq,t1_f1enpip,1569436539.0,"Brutal, even by standards. I love it!"
childfree,f1dyvu8,t3_d8q47q,1569406391.0,Nice! I'm glad he felt hurt for you calling him out on such a disgusting remark.
