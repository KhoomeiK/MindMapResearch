dating_advice,fovq4vq,t3_g9tnsa,1588105596.0,"It’s sucks! It’s not fair and if he does that then he doesn’t deserve you. And it means that he’s not really into it, he’s just saying those stuff cus he doesn’t have the balls to tell you the truth.I’m sorry but you deserve someone better!"
dating_advice,fovpo78,t3_g9tzi4,1588105369.0,Girls love confident abut not too much. Talk about yourself and share but also ask about her and make her feel important. Make the first move so she’ll know you can stand up for yourself and be direct with what you want(like a phone number or a date).
dating_advice,fovo0bm,t3_g9u0c3,1588104557.0,"No, not at all. As long as you are honest about the fact you are talking to more then one person and you haven’t defined with one of them something serious it’s ok. It’s fun to feel loved and wanted, have fun!"
dating_advice,fovn23r,t3_g9u7ke,1588104090.0,"I think you should talk to him. Communication is truly the secret for every relationship! Ask him directly what’s going on and if he’s seeing other girls?dont blame him for anything because you decided to introduce him to your kids before you had the “talk”, just have a regular conversation about it I’m sure he’ll open up."

dating_advice,eyo6665,t3_cxxdp6,1567270614.0,"Ask her stuff about her listen to her life story, give her a chance to talk about her she will love that! Don’t be insecure be a gentleman and be honest with yourself and her.
Have fun and make her laugh but don’t show that you are nervous,smile she will feel comfortable good luck!"
dating_advice,eyo44wx,t3_cxsckj,1567269288.0,"I’ve always been a person that would go after guys and flirt until they would ghost away from me. It’s fabulous that you worked on yourself but the reason you need to improve yourself should only be for you and for nobody else.
Go to bars with friends and just talk to guys for practice give yourself a chance to feel comfortable to talk to a guy for fun and not to flirt right away cus it will scare them away, they will like you for who you are and not cus of your flirting just be you. Once I started to focus on myself and have fun my dream guy found me and I was so into myself that i treated him like a friend and that’s what got him into me more! That I didn’t try to impress him I was me and had fun with him without any thoughts about dating 
Don’t worry he will come soon(my mom already asked me if I’m a lesbian because I didn’t had a boyfriend before him too so at least no one asked you this yet😂😂)"
dating_advice,eyo37uh,t3_cxnnnm,1567268671.0,"I think you should talk to him ,don’t show him that your upset just tell him you want an explanation why he did what he did? 
He should’t have lied to you but if you’ll show you angry and upset he would be afraid to tell you the truth"
relationship_advice,eylgkva,t3_cx9jul,1567183996.0,Sometimes you don’t know a person until he is angry or in an unusual situation .you should be relieved that you found out that he might be violent to you to the person he loved the most before you would have children.it must be hard for you to see this side but you should break up with home because you deserve better a lot better.ask your manager to go home because of the broods you got and take care of yourself
relationship_advice,eylfkan,t3_cxarib,1567183333.0,"She must be so hurt and confuse right now..I couldn’t imagine what she is going through 
I think you should help her she needs to know that you’re here for her and be patient and listen to her every time she needs to talk about it to let stuff out.also, do stuff to cheer her up! Take her to her favorite restaurant, concerts distract her.
And be patient when it comes to intimacy because it might be hard for her to be touched again...hope I could help"
relationship_advice,eylenm2,t3_cxfm6j,1567182735.0,I think he better have more reasons not to look at other women then sexual satisfaction.you need to stand up to him to realize if he really wants to be with you because of your character and ask him if it would be other way around what would he do? I hope some logic will get inside after he’ll think about it
