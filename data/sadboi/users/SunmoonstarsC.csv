selfimprovement,f7quvxn,t3_dxhsuh,1573970009.0,This breaks my heart so much because my son who is almost 16 and when he was younger he had some challenges that he has now overcome but it had an effect on his social life.He had a hard time making friends. I know at times he also feels like he is behind and I see he is trying so hard to check up.My son was embrassed about his voice being so deep since 13 and before I would notice that he didnt want to talk much or even read put loud. I taught my son that is voice is his own and he has nothing to be shamed of.I say that to you as well not even knowing you but I hear my son in your message. You are at the beginning of you adult life I been an adult for 43yrs and I am still learning and as adult at times I promise I feel like I am behind. The beauty is that you will live and meet all kinds of people use your voice to express yourself.We judge ourselves so hard. Live please dont give up because you are not alone and maybe you are the future friend to someone who needs you in their lives.Life gets better.I know and Yes if you are able look into speech therapy it really help my son in a huge way.

DeadBedrooms,f69abng,t3_dqirt9,1572739170.0,"Its heartbreaking to be pushed aside and think it because its the way you look...But he choose you for a reason now its time to look at what has changed. You are the same person regardless and You love You first. Don't let him make you feel low about yourself never give anyone that power. Lift your head up in this painful time and use that pain to push through. We cant make people want us and we shouldn't put that energy in someone that doesnt put that energy into the relationship.I know it hurts I'm here in the DB room for a similar reason... Feeling rejected and not desired from the ones we love But I am focusing on me. I just finish my workout looked in the mirror and told myself ""Noone will ever love you more or treat you better than I love and treat me."""
DeadBedrooms,f6840uw,t1_f67aoqw,1572725345.0,Its good to hear from a male point of view to be honest I didnt think guys felt rejected and have deep feelings like us women do. Sad but true...Maybe because my husband doesn't show it... Just sounds like the opposite of what I am dealing with from the female side...When a person knows they can take advantage and you will still be there...They will do it...But want she doesnt understand is that one day Yes one day you will get tired of it and thats it...You will move on and thats when she will want you the most...I see the words that I am typing and yet I am dealing with the samething it crazy how I can comment or give some input on others situations but have trouble dealing with my own and not applying the same advise for myself...People come to me in real life for advise and I help them all the time but I never apply ot to me...
