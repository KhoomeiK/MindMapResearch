AskReddit,fqtr9j4,t3_gkmcs6,1589644553.0,I’m a woman in my late twenties so the issue of having children does come up sometimes. I always tell people I plan to adopt and usually they just leave it at that. But what I don’t tell them is I probably need to adopt because of the rampant family history of postpartum depression and psychosis that runs on both my mom and dads side. I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe  I’d be a better parent if I didn’t get pregnant? It’s weird and maybe it sounds paranoid. I just think somehow my genetics don’t give me a good outcome if I had all those hormonal changes during a pregnancy. Not to mention my anxiety disorder and ptsd on top of all that.

AskReddit,fnuv8lr,t3_g3xrji,1587271988.0,"Awful teacher in high school geometry. She could barely speak English and I wish I were exaggerating. I have a dad from a different country so I always tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but she basically just mumbled quietly and passed out worksheets. Never stood up or offered to teach anything — we came to realize pretty quickly we were expected just to read from the textbook and fill out the sheets. She was never observed as far as I could tell.

I really wouldn’t have hated her that much until she one day wrote me up for skipping class when I had gone to the restroom with an awful case of period cramps and was out of her class for about half an hour. I explained this to her privately when the write up was given to me. She just stared blankly at me, said nothing, and after an awkward moment of silence I exited the room. Next day I’m called to the VP office to explain why I’d “gone off and yelled” at the teacher. I was lucky enough that the teacher next door vouched for me and said nothing like that happened. I was still made to “apologize” to her. Made a C in that class cause I had to teach myself too and that didn’t work out too well. 

I can only guess she was one of the several iffy hires at my high school during my time there. My algebra teacher openly admitted that he never had math certifications and he’d been a history teacher at his previous school. But at least he tried."

AskReddit,flqn5di,t3_fpyb6k,1585400720.0,"A year and a half ago, I was hired as a receptionist for a family owned trucking/logistics place. Family came from rich mountainside of our city and given my own background, I knew I’d feel a little out of place. Class differences turned out to be the least of my problems. It turned out they believed secretaries “never had enough work to do” and they made me an accounting assistant as well. I had no experience whatsoever with accounting and it was stressful, alongside working with an egoistic woman who believed she was in charge of the place because she was engaged to the company owners nephew. She started calling me retarded on a daily basis, always making sure I was in earshot. She started complaining I was going into work late. Not to mention this entire workplace had no issue regularly shouting racial slurs over the phone to CUSTOMERS of all people.

Last straw for me, aside from hearing the daily N words and racial slurs to the only other Mexican coworker in the place, came when my wannabe manager had me mail out spring/Easter cards to clients. No biggie. I mailed cards with the addresses I was given. Turns out A few of those were nonexistent or incorrect addresses and were sent back to the office. 

My wannabe manager decided this was all my fault and took the returned envelope, wrote in bold red ink “What the fuck is wrong with you?” And actually taped it to my desktop monitor. 

I took a photo of it and emailed it to the man who was supposed to be my actual manager. I was set to go on a cruise the following week and the pay period had just ended. I informed him of my resignation and left the office after lunch. He never followed up with me about the photo or behavior. I sent another email to him later detailing the issues with the racial slurs and I never heard back.

Hung out in the Caribbean after that!"

His teacher told me later that he said he knows the library teacher could never hate him anyway because I always give him a smile in the hallway...

Broke my damn heart. I know this kids parents, and they’re not the greatest. 

My behavior towards that class has changed since then... I made sure I didn’t display as much anger/frustration with them."

AskReddit,f3odw8l,t3_dhc7vw,1571015289.0,"Wasn’t so much of a question but I developed super bad posture I think from my PTSD. Still working on it, but I hunch over a lot when I really never used to. 

Was at the doctors and the nurse was taking my measurements, height, weight all that. I get super nervous during this part anyway.

Nurse gently told me “honey, stand up a little straighter for me.” 

Then, “is everything okay?”

I nodded, tried so hard not to cry."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f3o0ula,t1_f3nawrh,1571005597.0,"Yeah tbh my safety is a bit of a concern at this school. A lot of instances of kids getting violent with teachers (at ages 8-10, it’s appalling) and threatening all sorts of terrible things. 

I am actually on a temporary licensure without an official license since I’m still enrolled in grad school and went into library school later in life. I’ll have to look up if they can stop me from procuring my technical licensure next semester through student teaching. I’ll have to do that just to finish up the degree. 

Thank you for the advice!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f3mmkw3,t3_dh14ic,1570990166.0,"I had some significant shoulder acne in high school and my culprits were my sports bras! I started washing them regularly (like once or twice a week cuz I was working out a lot) and it eased up a lot. 

I also use cetaphil lotion after every shower and not a pimple since then! Before I was using Jergens or bath and body scented lotion."
thesims,f3mltnj,t1_f3me6t0,1570989900.0,No worries! I actually wanna check out stranger hood for the name alone Lol. I could probably find the Sims series again on YouTube if I just do some Internet searching
thesims,f3m8yqs,t1_f3lyaxy,1570984831.0,No this was something from maybe 2006-2007. I forget the creator who made it. It was mostly from the POV of Johnny and Ophelia from their teenage years to adulthood

AskReddit,f3io1br,t3_dgi4a2,1570939568.0,"I really didn’t think constant communication (especially with iPhones) was a thing. My ex, Lord love him, would just take hours to reply to a simple text. Granted we made up with hanging out in person and talking on the phone a lot, but texts were just not his thing and I got used to it.

In my next relationship, I felt so “smothered” with good morning texts and texts throughout the entire day when we’d be at work! And I imagine the guy was a little turned off when I’d call him every night too."
todayilearned,f3ijpzm,t3_dh0zuu,1570937626.0,"When I was a resident assistant in college, my first supervisor was absolutely obsessed with Myers Briggs and that personality test that assigns you an order of colors and that somehow determines your leadership quality? I was an INFJ and my color scheme scored me as a poor leader, and my boss would always bring that up in my job performance reviews. Not my interactions with residents or bad poster making skills... but my colors and INFJ-ness... 

And yes, you may wonder why RAs get performance reviews... no idea."

HobbyDrama,f3f5wm5,t1_f2un32x,1570890193.0,Do you have any links to this? I’m kinda curious.
HobbyDrama,f3f5b4e,t3_de0204,1570889940.0,"Well shit! I have to say I was a mega mortal instruments fan back in the early 2010s. I hated most of the main characters but enjoyed the universe and General plot so I was forcing myself to put up with Clary and Jace. I really loved the infernal devices prequel series too.

But I remember maybe around 2013 ish when my friend told me that this book was a “rewritten fanfic” of Harry Potter. I had a hard time believing it until he explained that he thought he used to follow an author on fan fiction with the same name as Clare/claire’s... and he couldn’t remember a whole lot except that Draco and Jace felt very familiar to him. He hadn’t kept up with the fan fic in question for too long because he hated the pairings in it. Now i get it haha. 

What a wild story though. I always got the vibe from Clare that she seemed a bit intimidated by criticism."

TrueOffMyChest,f2ywric,t3_deqard,1570500288.0,"As a person living with ptsd I 100% agree with you. Even without the privilege of consistent therapy I still find ways to get the help I need(I implore more ppl to look into online counseling/support groups to save $). I learned the world was not going to help me all of the time and cater to me, and I couldn’t let the triggers literally control my every move and emotion. Will they come back and bite me sometimes? Absolutely, but that’s why seeking help or learning how to cope is so important. 

You’ve got to be the change you want to see - in yourself and for the world."

I’d keep reading and invest in hobbies that I previously quit because I worried they were uncool (get back into playing piano and mandolin too.) 

Stay in shape and get out of those awful eating habits I established around ‘05 too. Stay on the volleyball team and don’t quit to go home and play video games. 

Hug my friends more often too - the ones who aren’t alive anymore"
AskReddit,f1ut6qy,t3_dap9i1,1569763343.0,They don’t know the extent of the sexual abuse I’ve endured from two partners of mine. Happened in my teens. It’s been almost ten years and idk how my parents would feel. They have freak outs at the slightest thing but I guess it would help them process my own mental health problems better. I suppose I’ve kept it secret because I don’t want them being mad at me for not telling them in the first place. It’s a bad cycle.
