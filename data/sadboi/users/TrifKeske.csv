And of course as I mentioned blizzard no longer focuses on the game, which on one hand means really slow updates and even slower releases, but on the other hand the small team that is working on it will have a bit more room to to improve stuff, while if actiblizz was all in on that ass they would just ruin everything like the did with the initial release.

We had our ups and downs, but it was obvious for a while that she didn't got what she wanted out of me. it was all about howI should do more, or how I shouldn't do things that she disliked, and I obliged. I never once questioned her, when i was wrong in was wrong. Did she ever do the same? No. Did she ever even once forgive me? No. There was not much I could do.
