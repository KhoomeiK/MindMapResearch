HumansBeingBros,fqs4uqo,t1_fqro98k,1589598558.0,We used to have a huge woods behind my childhood home.  Our family would always leave apples out and the deer would nearly come up to our door for them.  Two years ago they cut the woods down for new homes.  During construction we found a baby deer curled up on our porch for a few weeks.  I always felt happy knowing they trusted us. <3
