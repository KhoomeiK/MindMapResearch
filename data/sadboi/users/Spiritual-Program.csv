mastcelldisease,fpc89ka,t3_dwgf38,1588490996.0,"has the switch to CBD isolate worked for you? I was a long time marijuana user since 2008 and not sure if THC has helped or triggered my mastocytosis in my skin. The last few years I was a heavy user before I was officially diagnosed with Custaneous mastocytosis. I stopped smoking the vapes and herb altogether in the beginning of the quarantine and not sure if it was the stress, vape withdrawals, or if I was vaping too much of the vape carts to trigger more dark spots on my skin."
mastcelldisease,fo1ndft,t3_g56wpl,1587437100.0,"I am also an introvert, and get drained so easily..  I just feel so removed from society even before COVID-19..  

Are any of you on a plant based diet? It seemed to help me back in 2016 when I was eating very clean, I am currently incorporating animal protein like chicken breast and quail eggs, sometimes regular eggs but just the egg yolks. Overall, I've been trying to eat low histamine foods, getting rid of fermented, sour, aged, processed foods like they recommend to in multiple blogs.

I know diet varies for each persion with MCAD, I'm just curious to know what works for you. Are you very strict with your sleep schedule or just daily schedules in general?"
CBD,fng8ww7,t3_f7yysa,1586925276.0,"I just ordered vegan hemp seed oil from amazon with no additives at all, and it truly works for me. I feel better mentally and I don't need to take much, just a spoonful after breakfast and a little in the evening. I also apply it like lotion for my dry spots on hands from washing them too much the past month. lol"
CBD,fng8ple,t3_f7yysa,1586925125.0,"I do better with CBD isolate as well, but for me it really depends on the CBD, if it's pesticide free. I miss smoking weed but I'm better off, a lot of marijuana companies lie about being pesticide free so I prefer to not smoke anything at all anymore but I highly suggest the CBD isolate topicals."
mastcelldisease,fmvo4l3,t1_fly6by8,1586424283.0,"Thank you again for your reply. I am going to see an immunologist in my area that specializes in mast cell after we are out of lockdown for a second opinion like you suggested. God bless you and I admire your strength to deal with this. I know there is a high chance of CM progressing to SM, so I'm just trying to monitor my diet, symptoms, triggers, and moods for now and try to keep my stress down.. it's very difficult during this time but i'm working on it! I've had the dark spots since 2009 so I've most likely had mastocytosis since then.."
mastcelldisease,fmvmzpo,t1_fmuw7e0,1586423000.0,"i appreciate your response and reminder to keep working at this and i know it won't be easy but it's possible!

May i ask you if you had a dermatologist and then switched to a mast cell specialist after the diagnosis? And the cromolyn really helped to remove dark spots??"
mastcelldisease,fmvisqj,t1_fmv0s28,1586418494.0,"Sorry to butt in, I noticed my mastocytosis dark spots starting to appear on the back of my legs in 2009 when I worked as a cocktail waitress at a hotel pool. Everybody including myself thought it was only sunspots so I ignored it, up until January of this year when I decided to a see a dermatologist that diagnosed me with Mastocytosis. The spots are now on my stomach, lower back, parts of my chest, tiny amount on neck and underarms.. but for the most part my dermatologist says it only affects my skin but right now I'm monitoring my moods, symptoms, diet. The doc just prescribed an antihistamine and two topical creams but I'm going to get a second opinion with an allergist/immunologist that specializes in mastocytosis after all is safe out there. But for over 10 years I was living with it and had no idea..

I was bitten by a tick on my head right before that summer at the pool, I thought maybe I contracted Lyme disease at the time and it escalated to this.. or just being out under the sun for hours even with tons of suncreen might have caused it."
mastcelldisease,fmtw4op,t1_fmkr2xh,1586380051.0,yes let me send them once I get home
mastcelldisease,fmtw3of,t1_fmlbpc6,1586380036.0,"Sorry for the late reply, i just saw this now. Yes that's exactly what i have! I believe I have cutuneaous and my dermatologist said it's only affecting my skin but possibly in a few years they might need to test my bone marrow.. 

I've been monitoring myself for the past 30 days and I was eating TERRIBLE at the beginning of March and noticed i would get itchy and uncomfortable. I didn't notice if the spots became darker or not but I noticed intense exercise or longer duration of running/jogging will cause my legs to flare up but no itching at all. So i'm trying to take it easy with working out and just do enough to keep the stress away until I can see this allergist/immunologist in my area that deals with mast cell disease. 

Have you noticed what causes the spots to appear for you? Possibly sunlight, stress, or exercising?"
mastcelldisease,flwn0lq,t1_fl8hd31,1585556959.0,"What exactly happens if you push it to much? I apologize for butting in, I was just diagnosed with mastocytosis in January, and I'm learning something new everyday. I would always use exercise as a way to feel better, but I'm reading comments online to take it slow. I was doing the F45 thing 4-5x weekly with no issues just about two months ago or before COVID-19. I am going to try to get back into running, if exercise was a trigger, then will the usual symptoms appear? (flushing, itching, anxiety, rash, difficulty breathing?)."
mastcelldisease,flw57ea,t1_flozxug,1585539959.0,"Thanks for your reply! Sometimes I do have stomach problems but never diarrhea unless I just eat plain junk. They did the biopsies and bloodwork but they said everything looked fine so no need for a bone marrow test. My dermatologist put me on creams and Hydroxyzine HCL (does taking this med mean my form of the disease is serious/aggressive?).

What case or form do you have of mastocytosis?"
mastcelldisease,flw4tfl,t1_flouoro,1585539671.0,"i was doing F45 HIIT classes 4-5 x weekly before the coronavirus lockdown, so i guess its ok for now?  i guess i never monitored my skin after working out, and now i'm worried because exercise has always been a way for me to get to relax. Are you ok with working out and exercise?"
Anxiety,flcin48,t1_fksgh79,1585032330.0,youre such a trooper and tough as hell. hang in there we'll be okay! :)
Anxiety,flcezu0,t1_fkssi6m,1585028443.0,"SAME here! i am convinced I have corona virus, any minor chest pain or tickle in throat causes worry and causes an anxiety which two times this week caused an intense anxiety attack. I smoked weed earlier during the day on both days but I am definitely laying off it for now. I just took my prescribed medication (hydroxyzine) used for anxiety as a side effect of my mast cell disease which has helped. but the past week, I have had a really tough time getting to sleep, all the news going on about the coronavirus is taking a toll. its reassuring to know other people are going through this and will be okay."
mastcelldisease,fky846r,t3_fjxt5p,1584643515.0,"Yes i am experiencing the same symptoms - I have mastocytosis and I noticed i've been more stressed and getting warmer than usual and a bit clammy when i feel anxiety start to sink in. Usually happens after reading something or researching about the coronavirus. 

I smoked marijuana the other day and felt a sort of tightness in my chest, but sprayed some lavender oil and it instantly went away. hope you feel better man, do what you can to relax."
infj,fkcpfpt,t1_fkcoo3s,1584058143.0,"Also, you've probably heard this a few times but extroverts are great to become friends with. They always bring out our fun side lol"
infj,fkcoo3s,t3_fhep34,1584057647.0,"Sometimes you can also make an initiatve, but as the same personality type as you, most of my closest relationships are low maintenance.. Most of my friends are married, have kids, living their own lives, and when we do catch up again it's like nothing has changed and we are where we left off. 

The other friendships i've had where we became close for a while or certain amount of time, had tons of laughs, and deep convos but it burns out with certain people who misunderstand and take it personally, I feel like I can't always be that person they like all the time (extroverted and always up, need my recharging periods too). 

it's definitely an INFJ thing, it's rare for us to initiate anything, even with family. I'll probably initiate a hangout with only 4 specific people out of everyone I know, and it depends who's personality I want to be around and connect with at the moment. Sucha weirdo i know"
fakecartridges,fkc7fxc,t3_fhitbh,1584047282.0,was this from a delivery place?
fakecartridges,fkc78nv,t3_fhitbh,1584047165.0,"usually if  you call out the dispensary on it they'll usually give you a refund. weedmaps has verified products with a checkmark next to it if you want to see what they have in stock and the prices.. 

I'm in San Diego, and in regards to vape cartridges, I prfer Raw Gardens or PlugPlay. It is what gets me the most baked, prices are 30-40 for a half gram and 60-70 for a full gram for both. I recommend going straight to the dispensary and picking up there instead of delivery. Only because often times the drivers will take 2 hours to get to you and you never know if what you're getting is legit."
AskReddit,fkb1pro,t1_fk9y5ft,1584024317.0,she must be the best out everyone youve been with.
AskReddit,fkb1l8w,t1_fk9ytcj,1584024241.0,"Yes! unfortunately yes, so there is a little tension. He mentioned a few things to my coworkers that came back around to me. And he flirts when we are talking one on one, but no way could I ever act on it because I'm married and we work together."
AskReddit,fk9y12r,t3_fhaklx,1583986460.0,"This happened to me last month, thought of my coworker a lot which got me in the mood and lead to more sex with my husband.. and now i'm pregnant."
oilpen,fjx8buv,t1_fjw4gbf,1583661598.0,do you get pretty baked off buddies?
fakecartridges,fjwx752,t1_fdwjq3j,1583648349.0,do you make your own distillate?
oilpen,fjvqw2g,t3_ff3pva,1583630064.0,"It was a toss between friendly farms and raw for a while but overall raw is a better deal for the price and quality. 

Have you tried PlugPlay (not live resin) - I just tried their pods recently and have gone through 4 different strains. verified 1G for $60 - comes out to $65 total for tax,tip, and delivery were i'm at."
