However... and I truly believe this, it's that some of the bad things that happened to us had to happen, in a way. I don't know what you have been through, so my ""blanket statement"" might not apply to you, but for me.... the bad things that happened to me are precisely what makes me enjoy the little things in life right now.

I have a friend whose life has always been ""all high"", and... well, he's an okay guy, but he looks at people he considers ""less successful"" as inferior. And shit like that is why I'm proud that I have actually suffered the downs in my life, so that I can appreciate that people didn't have the same opportunities and privileges as the others - life is unfair to some and is VERY UNFAIR to others.

Sorry, kinda rambling, buy my point is, in a weird, twisted way, the failures that I have experienced made me grow faster and better in a different way than my so-called ""successful"" friend. It's sometimes very hard to see, trust me, I know this more than anyone, but... you would be totally different if some very important things hadn't happened to you."

I have also ""sort of"" isolated myself and am ""quite behind"" compared to other people my age, but that's the thing, exactly like you are proving, it is never too late, and plus, maybe this is just me idealizing it, but I don't think that you are ""playing catch up"" in a way.

I could be wrong, but the reason I say this is that, imagine if you went to college 12 years back, maybe you wouldn't have done well. Maybe you needed to realize what you realized, in order to get that motivation to do something for yourself.

Sorry, I might be babbling here, but long story short, I am in a similar boat and I am also kinda starting my life around being 30 years old, also felt like I have ""missed my 30s"", but this isn't exactly the case!

depression,fn2sl9r,t3_fyptoo,1586601629.0,"The thing is, the alternative isn't always better.

I'm quite honest with my feelings, and sometimes when a person asks me if I'm okay, I tell them ""Well... I'm not doing great to be honest"" and they'd all go ""Oh no what's up?"" showing concern at first, but it very quickly fades. Only true and close friends truly care about you, and even then, sometimes they don't necessarily have the time for you (not blaming them, we each have our own lives).

So yeah...I know this isn't particularly comforting, but I guess it's not bad that you are ""pretending"" towards other people, but for close friends, give it a shot, you'd be surprised sometimes people who you don't expect might be helpful might potentially brighten your day (but this is a double-edged sword, sometimes a person from which you expect support, can't offer you such things)"

Although, to be fair, I think that the ""outside"" good times is just a different kind of ""feel good"". Don't get me wrong, I like doing things in front of my PC or watching series and all that stuff, and I truly enjoy them a lot.

But sometimes when you are just out there with good friends, having a great time, it also feels good, even if you're not doing anything amazing. With the right people, you can feel very serene and appreciate them and yourself as well (makes you feel that you're worth a damn).

But yeah man, the very topic you brought up, is something that a lot of people around me have a hard time to grasp. They think that it's ""cute"" that I have good moments in front of the PC, they don't realize just how amazing my experiences have been here. Truly."
OverwatchUniversity,fg0eop8,t1_fg0efq9,1580406226.0,"I might try this in the future.

For now what I do is Main tank Rein or Orisa as I truly do enjoy playing main tank WHEN IT WORKS. So I give it a shot, and imho you see everything you have to during that first fight. If I think I can trust my team to utilize my tools, then Im gonna stick (fight won or lost), but if not, I switch to an independent tank."
OverwatchUniversity,ffzi9d5,t1_ffzfuqa,1580380500.0,"Yes, I think this is a big factor to that.

But I think there's more. I honestly think that the timer/percentage of the point and the super fast-paced environment contributes to it as well. 

When the enemy team has the advantage and they get closer to winning, just by them having the objective, it becomes this weird thing that ""doing nothing"" means ""contributing to losing""."
OverwatchUniversity,ffzh6z1,t1_ffyhk1z,1580378939.0,"This is one of the things that gets me the most. I'm just a low ranked player, but this is one thing that will push our chances of winning much higher, yet nobody seems to do it.

And unlike aiming, this doesn't particularly require much ""skill"" from people. Well...apparently a different kind of skill (awareness).

It's so painful as a main tank too, since you want to shield them, but they just go in and get killed 1 by 1. That's a way better option apparently."
OverwatchUniversity,ffwl98n,t1_ffwjvqk,1580304527.0,"I understand you. I have my communications open, but the second someone says something bad, I mute that person (even report if it's toxic). But there are times where people actually try to communicate in it.

I can't blame you for plain muting it though, the game itself already gives a lot of information per se. And if you have good game sense, you'll do just fine."
OverwatchUniversity,ffwl2lh,t3_evl4hd,1580304376.0,"Hello there! I've owned OW for a few years but never truly ""focused"" on it, but lately I have.

What I did lately was add people who were pleasant to play with (or even against), and by collecting those people, you end up having a playgroup.

Sure, it won't be competitive and you won't like everybody, and everybody won't like you (we all have our differences), but a lot of the things that you have written goes away when you have a pseudo-team of friends to play the game with.

Now, the game gets harder because the matchmaking pits you with higher level folks or other teams, so you really have to make communication worth it. And you'll see that it's easier said than done, and you'll see that there are CONS to teaming up with people, even friends.

That said, as a low rank OW player myself, I do experience all of which you have said in solo play, and as sad as it is, you just have to accept that there are things that are out of your control. I'm a tank main, and it pains me to see people go IN FRONT of my shield. It also pains me to see people go directly 1 by 1 to the enemy right after spawning (instead of waiting for everyone for a teamfight). You do what you can, but ultimately, you're playing with human beings who make their own decisions (as bad as they are).

Another thing as well is that, and I mean no offense by this, you are pitted with your teammates for a reason. The matchmaking works. I know you didn't directly complain about this, but I sense a hint of ""I know better than my teammates"" in most of what you've said. And, well, in some regards maybe, but you're at that rank for a reason. Be it mechanical, tactical or game-sense reasons, you're all around the same rank. So focus on becoming the best version of yourself. Reading up and watching pros/streamers can only help you so much - after a certain point it's up to you to rise up and be better (yes, I know you said you lack the time or skill to reach a higher rank - so then you have to accept the challenges that are in your current rank)."
OverwatchUniversity,ffrsr3y,t1_ffmc5p2,1580165002.0,"I like this, so I'll just come here and agree with this.

I'm just a lowly bronze, but I've been alternating ""main"" heroes here and there, and while my sr is stabilizing, I am DEFINITELY growing as a player. I used to be horrible at aiming. Now I'm still bad, but a lot less so than before. I used to have very poor awareness as a tank. I still probably do, but a lot less than before as well. 

And the thing is, if I completely ignore my sr, I am having a lot of fun and loving the fact that I am growing as a player and widening my hero pool. So yeah, don't be afraid to experiment guys! You might tank a bit of your sr, you might let yourself and your team down, but it's all worth it, because if you keep at it, you'll eventually see and feel yourself improve.

I can see how this might not work for some people though. Different people have different interpretations of what comp is/should be. I for one agree with you, that quickplay is simply a ""shitshow"" (which can be fun in itself), in that you can't really savor how the game ""is supposed to be"" in that mode, but in comp you absolutely can."
OverwatchUniversity,ffq9ur2,t1_ffnbi65,1580127504.0,"This is another factor that people tend to overlook. To improve takes a lot of time, so if you're the type of player who just plays after work or school, don't expect to miraculously get better, you will, but it will take a hell of a lot of time and effort.

toastme,ffm1oa6,t1_ffl44va,1580047176.0,"I'm so glad to hear this!

I've already commented, but just wanted to add a little story: Actually, this is why my reddit account got created! I was already interested in reddit back then, but what really made me make an account and post was after I fell in love with a close friend of mine, went for it, but she didn't feel the same way.

Got hurt, decided to make a couple of posts about it, got some good feedbacks (although there were toxic ones too...), and those good feedback really helped me look at things differently and helped me move on.

So yeah, I'm glad that it had the same effect to you! :D :D"
toastme,ffm1crw,t3_eu42kv,1580046985.0,"Happens to the best of us. Or maybe I'm just projecting a bit, lol, but like you, I've also been and still am peacefully single all this time, and I've had my fair share of rejections (and also being the one rejecting I think? not even sure lol).

Point is, you will grow from this, and I know that it startled your world, and the very first broken heart is very painful. I have forgotten how it feels now, but I remember that it hurt me a lot back then. But as I've said, you will grow stronger from this, you will learn from the experience (as painful as it is), and you will be more mature and be a better person because of it.

One thing I want to tell you though, is to focus on yourself and find out what works for you in order to move on. Different things work for different people. So talk with several, cherry-pick what kind of perspective and thoughts ""click"" for you in order to help you out, and do follow those thoughts! It's very hard to ""just get over it"" as your friends tell you, but they're not too far from the truth. They just lack the wisdom to tell you HOW to get over it (and frankly, as I've said, nobody has the right answer, different people react to different things).

For example, when I was really hurt by a certain rejection, I went to my elder brother. And he kept talking with words like ""defeat"" ""lost"" ""friendzoned"" and stuff like that. And frankly, while I appreciate his concern, that kind of way of seeing things was NOT working for me. I didn't see it as a conquest, I didn't want to see it as a ""loss"" or me being ""defeated"" or ""just being friendzoned"" (altho that's another topic, maybe I literally got zoned, but like, this idea of relationship > friendship bothered me, but I digress, lol!). So I went on to talk to other friends, and not one of them gave one great thing that helped me move on, but each one of them gave me one little thing that helped me - so I picked all of those good thoughts, and together, helped me move on with time.

All the best to you, stranger!"
relationship_advice,ffj8p7e,t1_ffj1ukl,1579993095.0,"There's actually good points in this message, so I come here to comment and commend it.

I just wanted to highlight the part where you (OP) need to talk to your mother. I'm sure you already have, but as the person above says, she might feel that her concerns are brushed off and unimportant, you have to make her feel that you are not discounting her out and I think that a real heart to heart talk is in order (perhaps for the Nth time).

But yes, as I've also already commented on another part here, do your best, but I think that this absolutely cannot continue, that child cannot feel that he's being disfavored for something that is out of their control."
relationship_advice,ffj88zd,t1_ffi6n19,1579992815.0,"Not OP, but just coming in here to support the content of this message.

I have not had a similar experience, but my mother has. Her story is basically that one of her aunts, for some reason, didn't like her. She would say mean things like ""I hope you end up having a great personality and intellect, because you certainly don't have the looks"", which might not seem all that horrible, but imagine being a child and a close elder relative telling you this, that really hits you.

So just like the person above me says, it gives the person a sense of apathy and unacceptance of the person being mean to them. My mother's aunt also tried to be nice to her towards the end, but that's because she actually became the most successful of her siblings, and we come from a 3rd world country, so my mom thought that it was just that she wanted some benefits from it (which I believe is also the case) rather than seeking redemption.

Anyway, long story short, I agree with the message of the person above, and it is absolutely important that your kid not be subjected to this, if it might be helped, it will only lead to developing apathy (or possibly even hatred) towards the other person, which one can honestly do without."

Of course, I didn't know she was actually this bad, but now seeing this and thinking back about that interview, it kinda makes sense and I am also wondering if she's a psycopath who just doesn't see anything wrong about the bullsh\*t she's doing."
depression,ff1uav7,t1_ff1rr0t,1579486347.0,"Yeah, this is pretty much it.

Look, I'm a realist and I know it is really tough to find work (currently unemployed), but a toxic workplace is about one of the worst things in life.

 Consider that you spend a lot of your total time awake at work, and even if you're not at work you are preoccupied by it even if you're not a workaholic (you have to prepare for it, transport time, worrying about stuff related to it, etc). So a TOXIC environment in that area of your life is a big no no.

You should definitely prioritize getting out of there, but you have to be strategic about it.

As for me, well, I guess I just don't last very long in those kinds of setting. I tend to try to resolve things, so it either gets actually resolved with mature people or it gets worse with people with actual VENOM in their veins instead of blood."

But it's nice that you have realized this now to be honest.

depression,ff0wycl,t3_doqwow,1579473079.0,"Yes, this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion.

I have been on both sides of this coin. As a ""helper"", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.

As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).

So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread."

Yes, there are people like what you describe (I think I'm going to shamelessly include myself in there! :D), but... I have encountered my fair share of people who have lived through bad mental health periods or just bad life circumstances, and they have NOT become better... sometimes even the opposite.

An example would be my father. He has gone through a tough time a few years back, and me going through mild depression, you would think he'd be understanding and empathetic eh? Nope. It seems to me that he absolutely forgot that time of his life. Or that's how he copes with it. Now that he's ""fine"", he doesn't want anything to remind him of that time, so he isn't at all understanding of my plight."
offmychest,ff0rmmy,t1_ff00am4,1579471672.0,"Hmm... good info, and yeah that kinda changes my view. I thought it would be something more like a year or so.

Without a doubt though, this s\*cks and I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't know you well so I don't know what to say to make you feel better, but I reiterate what I say before, that do whatever you have to do to make yourself feel better when it gets bad. I've been in your shoes and it really hurts. It feels like betrayal, like they're just willing to throw something meaningful just like that... you know?

offmychest,fezpsrr,t3_eqyi9k,1579460140.0,"Hello there! I have read your whole experience and I got some comments on it.

Firstly, like the other guy said, he took the first move to prevent himself from hurting more, I suppose. He sees that there's no future in it since you are leaving, so he just kind of moved on with his life.

Secondly, and I apologize in advance for how blunt I am with this, you guys are kinds confusing with the relationship/not in a relationship thing you were doing. I'm not super duper conservative and I get that we don't have to put a label on anything, but even though it might have worked somewhat, it seems that he maybe wanted more out of you than he let on. Probably? I dont even know, but maybe he wanted a bit more from you and you leaving for Europe kinda ruined that. But Im just guessing here.

Anyway, again, sorry for my previous comment, but the way I see it, as much as it hurts to have lost your....friend/fwb/potential bf whatever he was, I think it is better for you two as you are leaving anyway, and you wouldnt want a person with jealousy issues holding you back anyway. I hope you get over your broken heart about this sooner than later. I might have sounded harsh sometimes, but I have been where you are, I know how it hurts.

I have just replied to a thread about this, but basically, I had some insecure thoughts about myself as a person in terms of looks and personality due to the fact that I have never had a romantic relationship before. It wasn't super bad, but I really questioned a fair bit of myself due to that.

Now though? I'm not gonna lie, at times when I get down, I still do think about stuff, but it doesn't bother me anymore. I have kind of outgrown the problem. I don't preoccupy myself with the silly types of questions that I used to ask myself regarding it anymore."

depression,fes4bsp,t3_eqemq1,1579361279.0,"Hmm... I don't know if what I'm about to say might offer something of value to you, but I'm gonna go ahead and try.

I used to feel slightly similar to you. Not that strongly, but I definitely felt what you have described. I am 30 now and still have never had a girlfriend. But I'll be honest, it doesn't bother me now nearly as much as it used to bother me before. What changed? Well, my perspective about it.

You see, for the longest time, I kept thinking if there was something wrong with me. Why have I never had someone? Am I unattractive? Am I a shitty person? Don't I have game? Things like that. You can literally scratch and claw and find any sort of reason to justify why you're single (or why you're not for that matter). 

The thing is. It's just a relationship. To have a girlfriend is to just have a girlfriend. I am NOT downplaying having a meaningful relationship. But what I'm saying is that it isn't something magical that will just make all your worries away. It's not something that will fix all of these things that you are feeling. It's not the answer to your happiness. And I'm willing to bet that it's not the answer for all these jealousy feelings you have either. 

Hmm... sorry, I didn't mean for that to sound negative. What helped me was to realize that I'm not a bad person. Sure I got some mild depression. But me not having had a relationship or a girlfriend has nothing to do with my ""quality"" as a person in terms of looks or personality.

Drinking tea in itself is not, but most of the things surrounding it is: like the places where you can go to have tea and the stores as well are clearly for a more feminine audience.

Personally, it isn't too bothersome for me as a guy, since it isn't too over the top, and for me, I just buy the teas I like and enjoy it at my own home, so I'm not the audience anyway for these kinds of establishments. It's just kind of unfortunate I guess that it won't encourage other guys to drink tea, I suppose."
gout,fclveor,t3_ehv4np,1577757409.0,"Damn...reading these comments, this means that the attacks I have been having so far are mild ones. Believe me I am very grateful for that.

For me, my attacks aren't painful per se, but just that that part of my body becomes EXTREMELY sensitive to pain. Like even super thin bedsheets touching it will cause pain... So I would describe it as not painful but you must absolutely avoid the area that is hurting.

That said, my worst attack was when my foot toe was SO SENSITIVE that even ""wind"" makes it hurt. Thats when I resorted to powerful painkillers which helped me sleep the pain away..."

Same here, I'm a guy and I like cooking and drinking tea. I know that isn't anything special depending where you live, but here, drinking tea is ""kinda feminine"" what with all the cute boxes and just a lot more women are into it than men here.

For cooking, it's better nowadays than before, but I still get the occasional ""shock"" from people when they learn that I like cooking. Some have even went so far as to not believe me, and said that it's my mother who did the cooking. Lile f*ck right off, lol."

Could you double check?"
anno,fb8015h,t3_ebvgnx,1576603173.0,"Hello there! Gonna try to answer your questions :D

*Where is a good place to start to learn?*

\- I honestly believe that the best place to learn is **by playing the game itself.** You will learn on the fly what's good and what's not. Do not be afraid to **restart** a game over once you **learn something ""groundbreaking""**. There are a couple of things like this in the game, mix that with the fact that in this game, **there's no ""one way of playing""**, you can go for the utmost efficiency, you can go for beauty, you can go for functionality or even go with some weird themes you make for yourself - or a mix of all these things. So yeah, you learn a lot of things on the fly and there's no better way to learn than just playing the game!

*Is the in game tutorial good?*

\- It might be good or not for you, but the **campaign is basically the tutorial**, and it has some weird restrictions or whatnot, but I personally enjoyed it. So it might not be a bad idea to start with that, then once you're done with the campaign, you either start a new game or continue developing the city you've built during the campaign.

*Anyone have any suggestions on where to go to learn?*

\- As I have said, playing the game is the single most effective thing you can do to progress, but there's something that has helped me a lot, are these pages [https://anno1800.fandom.com/wiki/Production\_chains](https://anno1800.fandom.com/wiki/Production_chains) and [https://nihoel.github.io/Anno1800Calculator/](https://nihoel.github.io/Anno1800Calculator/) . These pages are **production chains** and **calculator**. The former is something for you to know how many buildings to build per item and for how many people they produce it. The latter is something to roughly calculate how much you need to produce to satisfy a certain amount of citizen (and their citizen types). 

BUT, both of these have somewhat been obsoleted by the fact that you can access an amazing **STATISTICS TAB IN-GAME** now (just click on your income on the top left of the screen). It might take a while to grasp it, but it's worth studying, because it gives great information (such as the stuff I've just said above with the links)."
anno,fb7yx9g,t1_fb4b0jk,1576602483.0,"Yeah this is a good approach to it. At first I aimed to have a limit of ""1k type of citizens each island"", but that's just very limiting. At some point you gain much more than you lose with royal taxes, even well before investors tier (provided that you adequately provide for your people's needs)"
anno,fb70yab,t3_ebspyj,1576568362.0,"There are 2 general ways to go about this:

You either rush Cape Trelawney or you do it at a later point after you have well developed your main island. Both are good options imo (I mean Im no expert and I play anno mainly sandbox mode).

The reason being that, before a certain point, your economy and production are still quite costly (when you get to investors money become super trivial), so it would be difficult to both work on your main island and cape trelawney at the same time."

What will the arctic region bring to the old and new world that would make that worthwhile? Items? Some sort of buff? An abundance of rare materials like zinc or gold? We'll see I guess! :D"
dragonage,fa0gpw0,t3_e7hr8k,1575754818.0,"Hello there! Might be an unpopular opinion around these parts, but it's okay to not start with Origin in my opinion.

I have started with Origin years ago, have loved it like most people here, loved the sequels, etc. But why do I say that it's okay to not start with Origin? Well, when I dived into it again after years of not touching the game, I felt that it didn't age very well. I'm talking specifically about the game mechanics here, obviously the story is the story and it's still an amazing journey and experience, but the gameplay... I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy something that sluggish anymore.

But then again, that might be because I have changed as a gamer/person and also the fact that it isn't new to me anymore that made it worse than it actually is.

Plus, the games are relatively independent of each other in terms of storyline. I mean yes there are links to them, but you can totally play the latest game without feeling lost. You might not be able to appreciate the whole scope of it, but the content is there for you to savor."
anno,f9yumpz,t3_e3895m,1575734155.0,"Anno 2070 is more of the classic Anno experience, whereas Anno 2205 is more streamlined.

I liked them both, their worlds are similar in the sense that it's in the future where water has taken over a lot of land, but also different in the sense that 2070 is a bit more ""dark"" and 2205 is more ""bright"" (I'm not talking about the situation of the world, but the feel of the world when you play it - like in 2205 for some reason it feels so cool to build all over that sweet untouched wilds and make it your own - in 2070 I didn't get to feel that, but it was also cool in its very own way).

So... I think if you're aiming for a more classic Anno experience, definitely go for 2070, but 2205 might be easier, but I got hooked by it a lot more than I did 2070 (seemingly an unpopular opinion around here :D)"

I didn't realize this at first, I also thought that it was just classic Varric, but going through my DAI playthrough right now immediately after DA2 and you can see the difference quite well.

And one other character that is iconic is actually the default male Hawke, I think. I mean, it's obviously a controversial pick, since people love modifying their characters and also playing the female Hawke (and modifying that one as well), but I remember the love that the DA2 intro trailer had (due to the success of origins) and him appearing as that in DAI is also freaking bad-ass."

The choice between a character that we haven't gotten to see much of and that isn't all that original over your player character from a previous game is just too skewed towards the latter emotionally speaking.

For me I can just go on and play brutal all day, but sometimes I want to chill and relax so I play on hard.

starcraft2coop,f8j6gtp,t1_f8ed2tk,1574596620.0,"Absolutely! I haven't touched on the subject on my main post, but I also love this side of coop. The fact that you can just switch the difficulty depending on what you want at that particular moment is so awesome.

Me for example, I can easily play brutal all day long, but sometimes I just want to sit back and relax, so I just play hard and try some stuff out. Or like even more recently, I haven't played the game in 2+ months so I'm rusty, so I just go hard for now - brutal when I get my comfort level back to how it was before.

Whereas with coop, it's much more laid back and chill. You can still play optimally and strive to be the best you can be, but in a more reasonable manner than when playing against another person."
starcraft2coop,f8j5nh3,t1_f8e15be,1574596388.0,"Yeah, exactly.

I like to play under my terms and just switch it up when the need is there. For example, I play hard recently because I haven't played for 2+ months, so I'm a bit rusty, but once I got my groove going, I can queue up for brutals and enjoy the ride.

About Karax - he's not my favorite commander, but I actually like him, mainly due to the fact that his zealots have this awesome rebirth upgrade. I love efficient mineral dump units :D - I normally mix that with Colossi and Immortal, since my allies generally go with air units anyway."

starcraft2coop,f8dvah7,t3_dzexvb,1574510717.0,"I used to be able to ""solo"" brutal back then, no it might still be possible, but I find that brutal is hard or difficult depending on whether my ally and I are helping each other out.

Like, if we attack bases or objectives together, it's a cakewalk, but if we try to solo it, either of us, we can still succeed but with considerable losses. It's obviously still doable, but it has become harder compared to before (I think a year or so ago they silently buffed the brutal difficulty). So yeah, I think that your own skill and that of your ally can really make or break brutal.

As others have said, if everything has gone smoothly in your game, by the time the enemy has 6+ colossi per wave, you must have already reached your ""deathball army"" point and just crush it - but if you had some difficulties during the early waves, then you might have delayed your deathball army a little bit and it has a harder time to deal with the big waves."

There are several ways to do this, and it kinda boils down to preference and also what you want thematically. For example, some people prefer to have specialized islands (workers, artisans, engineers only, or a mix of 2 classes that share ressources), some people prefer to have a whole industry island (where you min/max the majority of your production there, with no inhabitants and tons of pollution, naturally this island will also contain electricity and lots of ships will come and go here), basically you can do whatever and however you want it when you reach the point where money is no longer an issue, because of the freedom it gives you to just build/buy/make things.

As a side note regarding your electricity comment: I think it's a sad ""fact"" in this game that once you get your electricity/oil route available, this will drastically change the way you make cities/production lines - so you HAVE to restructure everything accordingly... it takes a bit of work but it's well worth it."

However! Do not underestimate the power of the human mind to adapt (this can be both good or bad). I say this, because I have felt the same way for the longest time (and I think I'm sinking back down, but I'm fighting it), but when I decided to take a course seriously and invested myself in it. I actually surprised myself as to how easy I got myself to become competent again! Same thing happened when I found my last job contract before a long period of isolation, I kinda went from a ""dumb husk"" to ""an efficient worker"" almost seamlessly!

Of course I am not guaranteeing this, but I am surely hoping that this would be the case for you once you find your groove back. Finding that groove back however... that is the whole point isn't it? I have no clue on how to do that, since I am striving for it myself.

dynastywarriors,f7miw9y,t1_f7mie0z,1573864536.0,"Damn, yeah 50$ is steep. I mean it's definitely a good game, but I don't know if it's ""worth that much"", since it isn't exactly a new game anymore. I bought mine on the most recent sale, I think it was 15$ or 20$.

You could probably search for game selling sites to see if they have promos (legit ones of course), or you are right, you could wait for the winter sale and grab it (I am not sure if KOEI does sales at the same time as the winter sales though - I would be inclined to say yes, but I am not certain of this).

But just my 2 cents, even though I enjoyed DW7, DW8 is basically an improved version of DW7, so... I wouldn't go buying DW7 for 20$ if I were you (I'm speaking strictly in the gameplay sense; DW7 is very different in terms of story though, it's a bit more personal than DW8, which is more ""kingdom-based"") - I'd rather wait for DW8XLCE sale instead."

Myself I have played DW8 on release, it was already a very complete DW game (amazing story and hypothetical route mode, great gameplay (no cloned movesets)), but I have just purchased the XL CE version recently and it's an upgrade to the already great game, and since it isn't a new game, the price is pretty good for what it is (I bought it on sale though, so even more bang for my buck :D)"
dynastywarriors,f7mh55u,t3_dv16zz,1573863168.0,"Hmm... you can basically just continue where you left off (DW4 onwards), but maybe I just have a good vision of them through rose-tinted glasses, they were great games at the time, but now more than 10 years later... probably not.

I actually recommend you to go with DW8 XL CE (Xtreme Legends Complete Edition). It's DW8 but with everything in it from the get go. The story is awesome, the gameplay is awesome, and I know this opinion gets echoed a lot, but it's the most complete and well-rounded DW game as of now. I've already played DW8 when it came out, but recently the Complete Edition went on sale, bought it and am playing it right now and it's glorious.

Whatever you choose, I hope you enjoy your stay :D"

If you think about it, DW8 is pretty much just DW7 upgraded (in terms of gameplay - not Musou Mode, DW7 and 8 are very different in that regard, both awesome).

So yeah, as for me I do keep up hope for the future of DW and SW games. I haven't played DW9 yet, so I cannot speak much in terms of what's going on in ""the most recent"" iteration, but both DW8 and SW4 were amazing, so I don't see why KOEI would let us down now."

I really enjoyed all of the stories (sadly didn't get to play XL but watched the videos on youtube) and I recommend for all the fans who might have skipped DW6 to maybe give it a go or at least watch the stuff on youtube.

As for your question... kind of hard for me to say since it has been a while since I have played it, but I'm going to try to do ""1 per faction"" like you.

Wei: Zhang Liao. It's funny, I really didn't like his design in this game, but his story is pretty cool, maybe it's just that his character is relatable to me. No, not the ""I'm super powerful"" type, but he's a very pensive person, and I like that, since I tend to be similar.

Wu: Tough call between Gan Ning and Sun Jian. As far as character development goes, probably Gan Ning's story. It fleshes out the relationship between him, Ling Tong and Lu Meng. It's really a cool dynamic what they have there. And Sun Jian's story mode because it is SO different than literally every thing else. It's like the Hypothetical Route pre-DW8 and it's insane. Plus, Sun Jian is one bad ass mofo.

Shu: Zhang Fei. Probably a personal bias since I am a Zhang Fei fan, or maybe a bit of revisionist perspective here, but I recall Zhang Fei being a bit more ""lighthearted"" in this game than in the subsequent games, I really liked this version of him. He's still very much of a stubborn, strong warrior, but he was a bit more sympathetic - and also the way Guan Yu's death affected him, which made him be more closer to Liu Bei as a result, I don't know, I really just liked it.

Other: Sorry, might be an unpopular opinion, but I didn't care much for either Diao Chan or Lu Bu in this game..."

I still haven't bought DW9 and probably won't any time soon, I'll probably wait for a complete edition and for that to be on sale (depends though), but this definitely makes me lean towards purchasing it (I was hesitant at first, due to the overwhelmingly negative reviews).

I don't know, it just feels ""wrong"" for me to skip a DW game. Even though, arguably, I might have already ""outgrown"" the franchise already. Like, I still enjoy the game (playing DW8XLCE atm! :D), but if I'm being truthful, maybe I'm not the ""target demographic"" anymore, as I am becoming older.

dynastywarriors,f7mecpa,t3_dwc2f5,1573861027.0,"I have started with DW4 and played every DW game since (except for DW9, still haven't bought that one, perhaps when it really becomes cheap like next year on a sale or something), so I can't speak about DW3.

For me, each iteration added a little bit of something to the franchise to be honest, and I'm the type of guy who has difficulty choosing ""just one"" favorite anyway.

But if I had to put DW4 as the best, I would say it's because of the way Musou Mode is structured. Now in retrospect, it is kind of like the predecessor of ""Hypothetical Mode"" (not entirely the same, but it's similar in the sense that you have the freedom to do some fights and not others - and some battles becomes available only while doing something specific - alternatively, NOT doing certain battles makes things harder/interesting for you). So the replayability value is quite high.

On top of that, and maybe this is rose-tinted glasses view, but this was during the PS2 era, games weren't super developed back then and life in general was simpler (for me at least) back then, so if you have a game with that much complexity and replayability, it's pretty damn memorable.

I also liked the tone of the game. It wasn't super duper serious, but it's more serious and less goofy than the subsequent ones. Everything about it supported this - the music, the story and even the atmosphere (the locations aren't bright and colorful as they are in later iterations of the game).

Those are just some of the things that I have personally liked more about DW4 than the other games."

Diablo,f7knvwv,t3_dwpefv,1573819876.0,"Haha!

Yeah. Thing is, community feedback is valuable, but sometimes it does tend to be a loud minority voice speaking. And then in turn, that tends to devolve into an echo chamber of people repeating it because they heard of it and agree with it.

What I sincerely hope is that the devs stick to their vision and create a game as they have planned it. And then yeah, listen to constructive feedback and make quality of life changes as the game goes on (so the changes will be applied via patches and/or expansions)."
diablo3,f7knnxa,t1_f7hxvrv,1573819611.0,"I understand your concerns, truly.

I have seen perfectly fine games dragged to the mud because of the negativity of what started as a voice of the loud minority, but that evolved into an echo chamber of negativity.

Especially nowadays where developers try to be more transparent and present in game communities.

Probably a hot take, but this is why I respect developers who stick to their vision, while considering community feedback, not letting themselves get consumed by pleasing it and still make the game that they envisioned and refine it.

I am not saying that customer feedback is worthless. Far from it. It is very valuable, but it has its downsides at times as well.

In short: I kind of hope that the developers of D4 stick to their guns, collect and consider feedback for quality of life changes, but don't change too much of their philosophy, and hopefully we will get ourselves a cool, fresh and original game. Do not lose hope, OP :)"
