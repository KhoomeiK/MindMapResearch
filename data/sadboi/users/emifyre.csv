It delegitimizes the entire movement by taking away any real meaning and adding on ridiculous cartoon names screaming oppression and prejudice when no one takes them seriously. I started my transition at 16. I am now 33 and 100% finished, surgery and birth certificate and all and this recent trend of infinite genders and jolly pirate nicknames makes people laugh and ridicule my choices. Its a toxic as hell community too. I replied to a post on some subreddit about how toxic the community is with my views on the subject and the response was me being berated for being a ""good little submissive trans girl dancing when you're told and not making a fuss about anything.""

This sort of got away from me, but to summarize - I completely agree.

Edit: That being said and all personal biases aside, I don't have a problem calling people what they like. If I can do one small thing to make someone's day or make them feel better why wouldn't I? Especially when it costs me zero effort. When I first came out, I was pretty effeminate and My whole body came alive when I got called Ma'am or miss. Something small like that was no effort on their part even if they didn't believe it, but it made my entire day."

Howwastoday,fq8vtok,t3_ghct50,1589177000.0,Today I visited a friend's house for the first time since quarantine started. He has been feeling really down working from home and never leaving the house and today he finally had the strength to invite me over for games. I played Splendor for the first time and we ordered subs from Jersey Mike's and watched YouTube videos. It was amazing.
TrueOffMyChest,fq3bhoq,t3_ggfvw1,1589064800.0,"As a trans woman I could not agree with you more. It is so upsetting when I hear people in my own community call themselves woke and activists and inclusive until you disagree. I literally had someone tell me that ""all men are guilty until proven innocent"" and that ""makes me prejudice but not sexist."" The hypocrisy is mind blowing.

I have had very good luck sexually and romantically. I have been in two long term relationships inthe past decade both before and after my surgery. Not once did I expect sex from anyone on the grounds that I am female so you must be attracted to me because you are a lesbian. 

I once made a reply to a post about how the LGBT community its is largely toxic and it got some traction. Mostly good stuff as I examined my life so far and my choices and the life I want for myself, which is very much not ""out and proud accept me or fuck yourself."" The main person who disagreed was another member of the community ostracized me for being a ""good little trans girl"" who ""does whatever she is told to fit in"" just because I don't paint a trans flag on everything and I want a normal healthy and content life. 

Anyway that got away from me, but the point is that everyone has preferences and most of them can't be helped. Everything from ""i like turtles"" to ""rape fantasies turn me on."" As long as you are respectful of their choices and don't treat them any differently because they are trans you are golden. 

The goal is equity rather than equality in my opinion."

AskReddit,fpx2q9t,t3_gfsi0q,1588974554.0,"This may seem trivial and it happened pretty recently. I was in the bathroom doing my thing and looking for something in my purse. I was the only one in the bathroom. I took out my keys and set them in my lap while I rummaged a bit more. The keys are pretty sizable. Not a giant groundskeeper set of keys, but there was at least 6 keys, two little wooden trinkets, a decorative metal key with the Seattle skyline that I got as a gift (thats another story), and this leather pick holder that buttoned closed with some guitar picks inside. The point is that it wasn't a light set of keys. 

So I shifted my weight or something and my keys fell. Now as I mentioned I was doing my business so my pants were at my knees. It looked like the keys fell in between my legs, but when I looked they were nowhere to be seen. There was absolutely no sound made when they fell, which is what made me think they landed in my pants. Once I was fully dressed, J searched around the toilet, under the toilet, inside the toilet, on the ground for all the other stalls, even in the trash bins in case they somehow made their way there. I would have heard if they fell in the toilet before it flushed. I even (im not proud of this) reached my hand into the toilet to see if they were stuck in there and maybe I just missed the sound. 

At this point I was losing my mind. A couple of other ladies came in and they helped look as weekend still nothing. Nothing in my workplaces lost and found either. They just vanished and I still can't wrap my head around wtf happened."

Cheat days for diets or ""I'm feeling unwell"" for work or school or whatever it is. We all need to feel like we are good people at the end of the day and it reminds me very much of the ""when they cut me off they are an ashore but when I do it I have a valid reason."" I am not saying any of this is bad because we are all guilty of it in one way or the other, just an observation I noticed. With the religion example it would be like ""of course this is bad and wrong but when I do it I'm technically correct.""

The actual scene where she does it is incredibly hard to watch, and this is coming from a girl who has attempted suicide 8 times in her life.

When I looked in the mirror it felt like I was looking at another person. I didnt recognize anything about meand what I did see didnt feel real. 

There is a lot of socialization that goes into it as in wanting to wear girly clothing or makeup or be treated in those subtle ways like a woman that are probably not okay but felt right. Like having the door held open. Keep in mind I grew up in the south where those lines are very clearly defined. 

Beyond just social norms, I want to carry a child. I want a period, a uterus, ovaries. I want to bond with other women over shared female experiences because that is what feels right to me. Imagine walking into a room you've seen every day for sixteen years and someone has slightly moved a piece of furniture. Looking at the room feels weird and wrong but you cant quite place how. I have fully transitioned, surgery and birth certificate and all, but it still kills me knowing that I cant have a baby.

rant,f512mwk,t1_f4zewvl,1571936370.0,"But OP didnt imply anything. They literally said that people who get offended at racist and homophobic things feel that way themselves. That seems pretty straightforward. 

OPs logic is set up so that any disagreement is seen as proving their point correctly thus making it so they cannot be wrong. It is a dishonest way of presenting ideas that in reality are completely generalized to an entire group of people (that being the idea of referring to anyone who fights injustice to be a stupid SJW and dismissing their ideas). Obviously shitty people exist, but it is by no means the entire group. I live in one of the most liberal cities in the country and have only met 1 person in the LGBT community who is a SJW in the 10 years I've been here."
CongratsLikeImFive,f41swwi,t1_f3zozym,1571323432.0,"Thank you! I had a depressive episode for a while and then got really into D&D as a DM. That helped me spark that desire and one day my partner had a dream I thought would make a cool story. I wrote 200 more words yesterday too, so I'm up to 7500! Writing has always helped me, so it feels really good. Anyway thank you again! I dont have many people I can tell and I wanted to scream it out loud. The job will be the most I ever made and I won't be poor anymore. That alone is huge! <3"

Keep in mind I know that's horrible and I didnt make it up. It is super helpful though and I remember because it was so outlandish."
findapath,f1k5poj,t3_d9nbk7,1569532097.0,"I had reached a point where there was no other good option. I was suffocating in all the open fields of the midwest and decided enough was enough. I had a credit card with a 4k limit and I ""bought"" something from myself with it via paypal, then transferred that to my bank. I gave away everything I had apart from what I could fit in a backpack and small suitcase, bought a train ticket to Seattle and left. It was very impulsive and happened very fast. It was scary because I had never even been to Seattle and didnt know anyone. I stayed in a hostel downtown for a bit while looking for a place to stay. That was 10 years ago and I haven't looked back. 

You have to have more reasons to go than stay where you are I think. Know that if you are on your own there is a possibility to be homeless, and that has to be worth it. I think now though it might be easier to look at places online and make friends with locals, especially if you are moving to a bigger city.

I'd love to answer any questions so feel free to DM me or not."

Also Sex Education."
