socialwork,fqvasi1,t3_gkxear,1589673345.0,"I had this same realization within my friendships as I grew as a person, and began healing through self-exploration and counseling. There was a lack of support, and toxic behaviors that I had consistently ignored. It became draining. 

It’s tough, but try to remind yourself that they aren’t at that point of growth quite yet! They may never get there, and it’s okay for you to notice these changes in yourself and how it’s affecting your friendships. You’re not the person you were before, and sometimes we outgrow others. I personally did kick some friends to the curb. I miss them, but I know I had to do what was best for me and them. On one hand, I was enabling toxic behaviors and on the other, I was exhausting myself. It’s perfectly okay to worry about yourself and your mental health. Sometimes temporary space can be so helpful to figure out what you need from that friendship and come up with a plan to talk to them if you think they’d be open for it! Unfortunately in my case very few friends could talk calmly about supporting one another."

II have had to do this for one of my relationships because I’m a sucker when he begged for me back. I had to do a lot of planning and emotionally preparing to do this (about 6 months). My most recent ex, I changed his number in my phone to “don’t reply” and blocked him on almost everything. I blocked his number when I was ready. 

It was tough. Gosh, he guilted me like crazy. Said he would kill himself, calling me a terrible person for just cutting contact, etc. I stood my ground and didn’t respond. It worked! I was free. I lived how I wanted, enjoyed myself for some time and then met my now husband. My ex is also is a happy relationship as far as I know.

Neither of us really felt it before around that time. I could tell when he got serious about me, and I about him. We started spending more time together, and got more comfortable around one another. We stayed with each other because we both knew we wanted to take things slow, and didn’t want to rush the relationship. I’ve always been the type to jump in relationships head first, fall in love, etc. this was vastly different, refreshing and I knew it was love and not me just getting wrapped up in my own emotions."

AskWomen,fmp3i7w,t3_fwizp8,1586273730.0,"I’ve had two relationships that were off/on again. With the first one, it didn’t work out. He was unmotivated, manipulative and entitled. He’s still the same, and plans to live with his mother the rest of his life. Never had a job, and very dramatic. It was off/on again because he cheated several times and I went back. I convinced myself I was in love, and he was worth it. 

The next relationship I had was off/on again as well. He was physically and emotionally abusive. We broke up several times. I would say issues we faced mostly were jealousy, infidelity, his anger issues and manipulation. He would tear me down, point out other women that were hot and didn’t like when I stood up for myself. If you haven’t guessed, that didn’t work out either. I kept going back because he was broken, and I wanted to help “fix” him. That was impossible, and I don’t have that power, which is what ultimately led to the final break up. 

I’m grateful for both relationships. I learned so much from both. I often get sad about the time I wasted with each person, but it ultimately led me to my husband, who is amazing!"

It’s disheartening and I wish I could step in on their behalf at times. The ONLY time I can get the police involved is if I call my client and she/he is actively being abused. I send the police out, reach out to my client and she/he usually says, “I told the police everything is fine, my partner is still here... I’m just not ready to leave.” Something like that, usually. Or, in rarer cases, the police do arrest the abuser due to marks on my client or the abuser still actively abusing my clients even with the police there. It sucks, and rarely the police help!

Depending on the severity of the abuse, she may lie and things could get much worse for her. It’s a sad situation, and I see it daily with all kinds of couples. You wish there was more you could do, but there isn’t. You could always leave certain numbers attached to her receipt such as 211 for “someone to talk to” and make it vague.

SuicideWatch,f1aoy30,t3_d8i5ux,1569300973.0,"It’s hard to feel the way you are. I’m sure it’s difficult to make it though the day, it sounds like it’s really exhausting for you. If focusing on finding something to make you want to live isn’t working, it might be time to try another method. 

I want to say, I have been where you are. I still have my dark days of course, and the feelings are there at times, but I try to push those thoughts out. I found the more I tried to find reasons to live, the more I thought about suicide and dying. So, I forced myself to START living. I began working out, and stopped caring what others thought. I also got off most forms of social media and quit following ANYTHING negative (news, bad people, cut out toxic people). But that’s what is working for me. For you, it could be different. Sometimes, writing a list of your goals in life out, and the steps to get there can be helpful to begin a plan. Or a pros and cons list of little things. Maybe even reminders on your phone every few hours with validation like, “you can do this” “i am loved and worthy” or whatever will help you. Have a “person” you can turn to when the thoughts really are too much for you. I hope you do chose you. I hope you choose life."
EatCheapAndHealthy,f1ao6jp,t3_d8i5va,1569300172.0,"For lunch, I typically make myself broccoli. Super low calories, cheap and delicious (sams club has large frozen bags). Blueberries are a good snack throughout the day, and in season in my area right now (Florida). Other veggies can be really cheap too, especially at sams club! I buy so much from there. I’ve been losing weight on eggs pretty quickly too. There’s so many ways to make them and they’re cheap for the amount. I’ll typically make an egg sandwich with 2 eggs, two slices of bread and a slice of cheese. I’ve been losing weight from that pretty well, but I also track my calories. Good luck!"

My energy is off and on, some days better than others. The skin... I have never had skin issues before and that’s the one thing I noticed when I gained all the weight - my skin looked terrible. I’m 25 and I have been told I look 35! Is the Keto diet restrictive? I’ve looked into a little, but I’m worried about restricting myself to much, and then binge eating. I’ll definitely look into it again."

Maybe just because of my experience, my husband does not text other women. He said he does it out of respect to me, which I never asked. Many of my friends relationships work about the same too. To each their own, I suppose. Is this new behavior for him? Has he ever done anything to break your trust? Those are some questions to ask yourself. I don’t know your past with him, so I can’t really give an informed answer."
