Men were all over the comment section of the news sites reporting on it shaming her and saying she chose that method because she wanted her suicide to get as much attention as possible, not because it being a bar open for everyone meant she could easily access (there aren’t a lot of very tall buildings here, plus most of them are offices and private apartment buildings) it - a high enough point to ensure there was no chance of survival when she jumped. They were also speculating it was because of a breakup with some guy and other shallow, childish reasons, even though her family stated she had been struggling with serious mental illness for a long time. A man jumped from the same building about 10 years ago and of course, no one was saying stuff like that about him. It’s so exhausting to never be taken seriously in any situation."
