In terms of what is done right, MDs who have felt the most supportive are those who ask if I am doing OK mentally and if I would like a referral to therapy.

1.Pulling a tooth is a last resort. If you do not experience pain, your pulp is likely fine so a regular filling might do the trick. If the break is too extensive and a filling would not protect your tooth properly, then a crown is in order. If your pulp is affected or the break is too close, then they do a root canal before putting on a crown: take out all the live tissue in the tooth, fill it up and then put on a crown. If the tooth is cracked all the way down, has too much damage too low on the root, etc... then they will pull it. You don‚Äôt want to keep a hole because teeth shift, though if it‚Äôs the last one in the back for you then it could be ok to leave it empty. Once a tooth is pulled out, you can get a bridge (not great because that means crowns on each side tooth), an implant (best long term, but $$$) where they drill a metallic screw in the bone to act as a root and then put a crown on top of that, or a partial denture. So in that regard, there is always a way to not have a visibly missing tooth. 

2. I work at a dental office in the bay area, we see emergencies but it might be harder for you to get to a doc as a new patient. Keep calling around. A broken tooth can wait but sometimes it can‚Äôt. Where I work there is a dental society that helps find docs when you have an emergency. Call around and listen to answering machines: they might give you the emergency number and make your life easier to find someone willing to see you. It‚Äôs a big risk for dentists to see patients during covid because they deal directly with your mouth and saliva, without N95 masks or face shield."

Injection site discomfort can happen with any procedure. Swelling, pain, etc... So that doesn‚Äôt make me not trust the second dentist you saw, I also understand not wanting to touch someone else‚Äôs work when a file has been broken. Means your tooth is likely hard to work with to begin with and now they have to try to get the piece out without knowing when or how exactly it got stuck. Because numbing can take time, doing the injection first is not that surprising. Numb first, take xrays while everything gets numb, start procedure. The front desk usually doesn‚Äôt look at details of your file and will schedule just saying it‚Äôs part II of the root canal. That‚Äôs the easy part: wash out, put filing. That dentist at least had the decency to refuse and not make things worse.

When it comes to files breaking in the tooth, I am not sure what doctors are told to do/say to the patient. It‚Äôs a fairly common complication and happens even to the best but I don‚Äôt know if they are supposed to tell you right away or if they wait to see if they can get it out before worrying you. Even if it stays in there, you definitely wouldn‚Äôt be the only person walking around with one. Not an ideal situation but root canals are 90% effective anyway so it could fail regardless.

If you do not trust your doc at all anymore, if you have an alternative you think is better then why not go to someone else but it sounds like your dentist is trying to do the right thing and fix the front desk‚Äôs mistake. I work at a general dentist front desk, we don‚Äôt do root canals, but I can assure you that if I made the mistake to move a patient like this I‚Äôd be in big trouble. 
Perhaps talk to your dentist again, ask how confident he feels to get the file out, what is the prognosis if it stays there? Etc... if that doesn‚Äôt make you feel better, start calling endodontists."

I had binge eating disorder for 20yrs. I am now 32 and fully recovered and eat carbs freely, workout without it being a punishment or to achieve a body goal, and I‚Äôm at a normal BMI (even if those are BS anyway) 

I was never underweight though I got close when my ED switched to exercise bulimia for a couple years. EDs have all sorts of looks: i did group therapy and the others attending had all the body types out in the world. It does not discriminate.

Your life has been so much trauma and anxiety that is out of your control, it‚Äôs kind of logical you would develop a coping mechanism that is all about control. EDs are often mistaken for being all about food but that‚Äôs the symptom. It‚Äôs a coping mechanism for something else. For me, i was an extremely anxious person with a very controlling mom who always wanted me on a diet so bingeing was a way to subconsciously go against her control. Despite moving out at 18, it stayed with me until my 30‚Äôs. Mostly because I ignored the problem and didn‚Äôt get help right away when I could.

Recovery is very real but it requires a LOT of patience, self-reflection, willingness to change, to let go.

Continue therapy, switch methods if it doesn‚Äôt continue to help, keep seeking tools that help you let go of the ED, etc...

EatingDisorders,fkc8f8k,t3_fhk7en,1584047843.0,"I LOVE this!

More positivity from me: I have had binge eating disorder since at least 12 years old (I can remember body dysmorphia and bingeing already at that age) it stayed with me through college and I had a bout of orthorexia/exercise bulimia peppered with weekly binges for about 2 years which ended when I was 25 and then went back to full on BED.

I am now turning 33 this year and have been fully recovered for over a year. I was already on a great path for several years before then and constantly growing, but I can say I love my body, see it for what it is, am happy, have no anxieties around food, etc... fully living life outside of obsessive food thoughts or fears of falling back into the disorder for over a year.

FULL recovery is possible, no matter how long you have been stuck in the cycle. It tales patience and yes, GRACE! Or what I like to call self-compassion üíï"

Just stop bingeing does not work, i had binge eating disorder for over 10 years and then developed orthorexia and exercise bulimia from that mentality and still had bingeing episodes every weekend to then again be plagued with BED for a good 5yrs until I realized that losing weight was not the most important goal. I ‚Äústopped bingeing‚Äù a million times to then binge again and hate myself and make it all worse.

Heal what is causing the binges, restriction causes binges too. You can lose weight later without destroying your mental health and losing years by being your own worst enemy. Brain over binge is nice to teach you that you are not your disorder and you can recover from it.

EatingDisorders,fk44gwu,t3_fgei12,1583853111.0,"You can‚Äôt be on a diet because that plays into the restrictive cycle. I had binge eating for a VERY long time and I always thought the solution was to be structured and stop bingeing.

The truth is, telling yourself ‚Äújust stop bingeing‚Äù is restrictive and triggering and will make you binge. Putting control on your diet will eventually cause a binge.

It sounds crazy but the solution is to give yourself ALL the permissions. I ate all the things on my ‚Äúno‚Äù list for almost a year and then my body finally trusted me and I started not craving only those foods. Now my diet is very normal without having to try.

My two brothers are on the spectrum but they are very very mild and you can‚Äôt tell by just having a casual conversation and not being around them a lot. My younger brother had lots of issues with food and only wanting to eat pasta with nothing on it and drinking only water when it had syrup in it (like shirley temples) so what my mom did was actually slowly diminish the syrup in the water. Originally she had started putting it in there to get him to drink water but realized it may not have been the best. It could be a way for you to control the amount of sugar in the drink? Switch to a syrup/dilute the soda and very slowly put less and less until he can drink straight up water.
My brother is now 28 and he is a very introverted computer programmer. Still likes the same foods and sugary drinks but he can tolerate to diversify and drink water."

Group therapy with people from around the globe. When I did it there were americans from different states, australians, germans, british, south american... and the live calls were at different times to accomodate time differences and recorded to listen to later if you couldn‚Äôt make a call. One girl was doing an inpatient program AND this online program at the same time and shared insight from what she learned in her inpatient experience. I highly recommend, just can be a little pricey.

What do you think was the turning point that made you go back to it?
What, if anything, is a setting that is conducive to you eating?

Eating disorders are a coping mechanism and they hid something else: fears, anxiety, loneliness, depression... pretty much anything under the sun is possible.
It‚Äôs important to heal your appetite for survival reasons but the most important is not the food, it‚Äôs why you need that control over your life. Not eating is an easy way to control something, anything, what is it in your life you have no control over but wish you did?

I‚Äôm in no way a replacement to therapy + proper nutrition but these questions really helped me understand my behaviors and what i was actually fighting. Once I started recovery it became clear that I was an extremely anxious person and the ED gave my brain something to keep busy with that I could handle. Once that was made clear, it became much easier to not be afraid of the ED, to know there are much better ways of coping that actually resolve the root cause."

If you want a supportive relationship, you need someone who is at least willing to learn how to navigate complimenting you. That‚Äôs what I did with my bf. He knows to tell me I look happy or compliment things that have nothing to do with weight.

Stress can cause high acid in the stomach and make you feel sick. I was prescribed antacids for something similar and it helped a lot.

Being stressed out puts you in fight or flight response whereas eating triggers the rest and digest response. If you‚Äôre really stressed out and stuck in fight or flight, it‚Äôs hard to get it to switch.

Slow down, meditate, find things that are grounding and don‚Äôt put pressure into eating.
