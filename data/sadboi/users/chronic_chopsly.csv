trees,fojg29c,t3_g7hw78,1587819886.0,"Ok I'll be structural about this.
Cannabis is hemp and marijuana. Its all made up labels to describe the same plant with different tendencies. So if you're not dumb high you.could just say its hemp. Game over.
But if you lose control then it gets.a little harder. And for that I say you make.your.case on how it's a benefit. Weirdly enough I could smoke bowl after bowl and.not go all stupid. I theorize.this is because my body is just bad at making endocannaboids. Which the photocannaboids act as a proxy. If vaping nicotine stop.because people.who don't vape hate vapes and you're a few bad bumps.from switching to cigs. Personally I don't drink just.smoke because every male on my fathers side gets into drinking and turns into an alcoholic. So even when I smoke they just equate that to a vice instead of debauchery. Also drinking and smoking at 18 they probably want you to go to college and not blow it. But.honestly going to a 4 year school without scholarships isn't the smartest move. Honestly it makes way more sense to do a trade.and/or get training for a trade and save up until you.can pay for.college because the change and.expectations are weighty. Also the trade will be something you can fall back on and maybe even use.
And let me just throw some numbers out for you so you'll understand.
In the 70s the minimum wage was 2.10/an hour and a semester would cost around 150.
Now the minimum wage is like 7.25 and if the rates stayed proportional it would be like 740.
But you may find that the price for a.degree is blown up to roughly 24x as much as.it used to.
The worst part is most.of the cost isn't even.going back in to the quality of.education as.you are.pretty much paying.for lectures and tests and you got.to learn from reading the book, which.costs.even more money. And of course you can't.get like last year's edition even though nothings really changed besides page.numbers wordings and a code to an online program that your professor sends your.homework. but do what ever you deem the best."

A dog could go its whole life without a name, but in a pack it might be known for its smell or look, and only acts when prompted with action of another.

Crackhead energy
The abyss 
The void
The mania is crackhead where I am full of energy but make rapid conclusions and I'm very touchy (in an emotional sense) 
The abyss is depression where I can analyze correctly and come to dark conclusions and I feel like I should stay to myself as I don't want to bring anyone down.
The void is this other state where I am riddled with concepts that are unsure if they are true or not. I'm spacey and stay pretty much to myself. Commonly I'll stare into space sometimes because I'm seeing visual distortion or because I'm stuck in my own head or both.
Mania is good for directed work.
Depression is good for my interpersonal but at difficulty.
And the void well the void is for freaking people out I guess. I would rather be in the void or the abyss than mania because I know the mania is fake and it makes it so I don't really think as an intp I would often love to think before this onset. I was about 30% mania 60% depression and 10% void on average with light variation. Now it seems I flow between these three states randomly and with one at about a 70% majority."
