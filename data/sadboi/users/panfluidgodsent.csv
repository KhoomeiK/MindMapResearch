He broke up with her and him and i became closer then before. he was even my first date. through lies, and attempted manipulation due to his ex (his ex was trying to make amends with everyone that was close to him in attempt to have everyone on her side and against his because she was mad at him because of. the whole situation.) (even got nypd envolved) through the whole ordeal i stood by his side and he stood by mine. 

oh also, his ex got kicked out of the school. him and i arent dating but i love where we are now. and thats my story with my crush."
