AskReddit,fa9z693,t1_fa9ya0c,1575897438.0,"I've done a bit of research (namely reading a few papers) and there's a type of meditation in which you just walk. The point is to focus on your feet. How you are moving, when they touch the ground, the movement of your legs and hips, etc. You could try that since you'd be moving and focusing in a set of things.

&#x200B;

PS: Perhaps you can try that as well. Focusing on a set of things that belong in the same category. For example, in my suggestion you'd focus on everything your lower body does to walk, yet your attention remains on your lower body -- even if it's shifting."
