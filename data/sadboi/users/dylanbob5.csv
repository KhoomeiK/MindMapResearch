Comedy is entirely subjective. What makes you laugh might not make me laugh. Being edgy and saying crazy, reprehensible shit *can* be funny.

Being ""unfunny"" is an individual opinion. If you believe they're dumb and unfunny then you don't have to pay attention to them. The more conservative comedians and commentators know they're gonna be heavily scrutinized. Their views are solely their own and it's up to the audience to either agree or disagree. Disagreeing with them doesn't mean they are entirely bad, unfunny, despicable, dangerous people. It's just different. They don't deserve to be deplatformed and banned from the public eye.

One thing I've picked up from listening to a lot of podcasts where comedians talk about the road to becoming great at stand-up (specifically) is the amount of hard work and *time* it takes. There are a bunch of different factors, but a lot of it boils down to an oversaturated comedy market combined with the sharp increase in quality over the last couple of decades. There are *sooo* many working/aspiring comedians nowadays. 


The general consensus amongst comedians is that it usually takes *at least* ~15 years to become a well regarded comedian. There are always exceptions to the rule. Guys like Dave Chappelle, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, and Bo Burnham were wunderkinds who got good quickly and blew up unusually fast (late teens - early 20s). I'd put Donald Glover in that list as well. He's *insanely* talented and excels at basically everything he does. His comedy special was okay. Pretty green and not polished yet. But it's clear that his natural talent as an artist, writer, and performer would've catapulted him to a high level pretty quickly if he had kept going in stand-up comedy. His special was way better than almost any other 24 year old comedian could put out. There were some solid jokes in his special. 24 is *very* young in stand-up comedy. Hell, even 10 years of experience is considered fairly green as a comedian nowadays.


He's so accomplished in other fields now so it's hard to really step back and assess his stand-up special for what it was."

Bingo.


Sexually based offenses are *powerful* accusations. They change the accused person's life forever. Regardless of whether they are guilty or not, that stigma is extremely difficult to overcome. People do everything they can to distance themselves from you and want to cut ties personally, professionally, and politically. There's no need for anyone to have evidence. The accusation is out there. It effectively removes that person from their position indefinitely because now nobody can forget it. People have deep-seated convictions about how severe and gross sexual misconduct can be. It's intimate and personal. And instead of being used only for very serious situations for heinous acts, it has now become a silver bullet used for permanently damaging people's lives.

The latter is more due to being self-absorbed and inconsiderate.


People ghost *constantly* regardless of whether they approve of ghosting, in principle, or not. It's due to passive aggression, ""letting him/her down easy,"" and fear.

They attempt to justify it by claiming that their fear and/or desire to not avoid making someone feel bad justifies their methods. Fear of conflict, or even just potential discomfort, has taken precedent over everything else. Discomfort used to just be part of life. Now it's too easy to end things but avoid that difficult conversation entirely. It's a silent way to run and hide from people. If it won't necessarily be a pleasant or ""comfortable"" conversation then people use it as an out.


Instead of feeling bad about potentially hurting someone or facing moments when you'll have to toughen up and take it, ghosting is used to avoid all of that.

I don't like ""maybe"" girls. They don't know what they want and ultimately just waste my time. But I know when I have solid chemistry and compatibility with someone.
