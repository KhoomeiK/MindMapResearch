BPD,exsx530,t3_cu077z,1566558739.0,"look, my non-BPD friend just ended his relationship for a silly reason and kept asking me if he should end it after every small joke or semi argument. It's not worth it. People act like dating someone is adopting a child these days. Seeing anyone consistently causes arguments, that's just how it goes. Work on and for this person you love."
