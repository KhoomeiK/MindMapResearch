depression,ewg70cp,t3_cml6ni,1565375293.0,"Have not been feeling well this week. I'm very upset and stuck most of the time with myself.

There has been this person that have caught my interest and I really want to connect with this person more. Every time I try, I haven't made a solid impression on them to show my interest. It really frustrates me because I'm not present in the person and I'm not making the best of my opportunities.

I feel like shit about it. I feel really lonely in my life. I don't have anyone to talk to personally and the people I do not really talk me. I feel so invisible to people most of the time. When I do have moments that can bring me out of the dumps of loneliness, I don't take action, will freeze up or say something stupid. I get down on shit like this because I'm the responsible for how I feel but I let the emotions get to me. I wish I can have someone to rely on when things feel overwhelming."
depression,eogztm1,t3_anh7tv,1558569508.0,"I feel really empty right now. I just not sure how to reach out to people when I need help. I've been posting a lot here over the past week and trying to stay positive but I'm starting to get critical of myself.  I'm sure of the people to reach out to because nobody want to hear me talk about what is going on. I've calling a hotline and got cold responses which is disheartening when you want to reach out and get help. I just feel lost right now, I'm hoping to get out of this but it seem bleak a t the moment."

NoFap,eogxju5,t3_brvte1,1558567994.0,"Have hobbies and create projects for yourself with due dates are somethings I find helpful. Try volunteering also. I try to keep busy thought out the day so I don't keep mind on it.

Good job at close to a year.  If you can go almost a year, I know you can hit that mark!"
NoFap,eog47kt,t3_brocxu,1558550409.0,pick yourself. Don't be so hard on yourself. start over and try again. Don't give up and look down on yourself. You can do this!!
depression,eog3wac,t3_brg0mz,1558550243.0,yea I feel that also. I try to do social things on my own and it feels overwhelming because I feel  I'm not being real to people and question my intentions towards people.
depression,eog3bxm,t1_eofqnrp,1558549902.0,I agree with that. I think it the attachment to the thoughts we have for someone it gives a lot of power away and it can be hard to detached.
depression,eog2ms7,t1_eog1lq9,1558549434.0,yah :)
NoFap,eofsu7k,t3_brmf3q,1558542644.0,I'm happy to hear that you have your willpower is getting stronger. Keep it going with the progression!
depression,eoc6pe4,t3_br8ovu,1558453813.0,"I call the hotlines before. It can feel empty when speaking to them and they don't seem to be really listening. But I've looked at their perspective, they are probably dealing with a lot of calls and they really can't be emotional available to everyone which sucks. I looked at the hotlines now as a way to vent without having feedback.

 It sucks when you are having a distressing moment and this resource is suppose to help with it."
