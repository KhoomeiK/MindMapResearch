DIY,fqdeoga,t1_fqdahna,1589287982.0,"Thanks for your reply. It’s tap fed, so I really just want to drill two holes into the pvc to hold the riser rail really and to support the shower itself"
AmItheAsshole,fp49vqi,t1_fp2n61l,1588294598.0,Huge YTA. If you were my boyfriend I would dump you at the earliest opportunity. Your sense of entitlement is insane. You have hundreds of comments breaking this all down for you and you’re still being a stubborn asshole
CoronavirusUK,foy8yf5,t3_ga8sr4,1588167945.0,"Yep our company have asked us to take 30% of our holiday (we get 6 weeks) just so when we go back to work, they aren’t swarmed with everyone wanting to suddenly book holiday and there aren’t any staff."

MakeupAddiction,fo0pyhd,t1_fo0bas5,1587417607.0,"Don’t know why you’ve been downvoted, I completely agree. It’s CC on her makeup, she’s not asking for CC on her hair? It makes little to no impact on her makeup look"
COVID19positive,fn16600,t3_fyn73j,1586555573.0,I’m so happy for you :)
CoronavirusUK,fm8rp9t,t3_ftlogr,1585854769.0,I went to my local Tesco and I didn’t really see any rollbacks. There was plenty of pasta because most of them were £1.50-£2.50 per box at standard price. The things that are cheap originally were gone. But yeah I usually see a lot of rollbacks like 50p or £1 cheaper but everything was at the standard price. I’m sure that’s put people off
Coronavirus,fm2foe8,t1_fm0lrqx,1585696547.0,This makes no sense because people don’t always have fevers with this virus. I’ve read of a lot of positive milder cases that had no fever at all. There are also a decent percentage of asymptomatic cases where the carrier show zero symptoms of the virus but are still very contagious..
COVID19positive,fltjcwk,t1_fltj9dq,1585475389.0,No we can’t in the U.K. unless you’re hospitalised :(
COVID19positive,flsgi1v,t1_flsf59a,1585441596.0,"Oh me too 100%! It is soooo fucking weird how I can’t smell at all. My nose isnt blocked at all. I can’t even smell perfume out of the bottle, even when I have a cold, I can still smell a whiff of perfume slightly. But my sense of smell is completely gone. It’s crazy!"
COVID19positive,flscsuv,t1_flsasdg,1585439271.0,"Yeah this has really put into perspective how limited our resources are in hospitals. Especially in the U.K. this whole situation has really shown me how underfunded the NHS is. But you’re totally right, I certainly agree that hospitals should be looking after the critically ill, but hearing someone being sent home with pneumonia is still insane to me"
COVID19positive,fls20l6,t1_flrxusp,1585432669.0,"Wowieeee, I had a very slight sore throat for the first 3 days or so and bad headaches/dizziness & confusion after that but no fever. I don’t have a cough but I haven’t been able to smell or taste for 4 days. I’m like 90% sure I have it. I don’t even know you but I am truly happy that you have recovered from this lol. I almost want to say congrats 😂"
COVID19positive,fls1dca,t1_flrv2ux,1585432284.0,What the actual FUCK? They turned her away with pneumonia?! I am so so so sorry. The health care system can’t cope with this virus. I am truly hoping for the fast recovery of your mother. Please continue to look after her.

COVID19positive,floqhyr,t1_floot62,1585343425.0,I also agree with the humidifier! I have super super mild symptoms (haven’t been tested positive in the UK) and it’s really helping when I feel short of breath.

COVID19positive,flkkisq,t1_flkjapa,1585242638.0,I think it’s a mix of both? Because a lot of fit healthy younger people are ending up in ICU. I think you just got extremely lucky with a mild strain
COVID19positive,flkjvpo,t1_flkjoea,1585242295.0,I had a bath the other day and I couldn’t breathe and felt like I was going to pass out! This is insane. I hope you feel back to normal soon. Thanks so much for updating your symptoms
COVID19positive,flkjked,t1_flki2ub,1585242126.0,"We do have one, but as soon as you call they say that if you don’t have a critical condition, to hang up.

And I slept way more than usual both nights. So weird!!"
COVID19positive,flkflxc,t3_fp5nz0,1585240000.0,"Does anybody know that if you have an extremely mild strain of the virus, would that mean that whoever you transmit it to would also have the same extremely mild symptoms? Sorry I know this is probably a really stupid question"
COVID19positive,flkf1f1,t1_flkdyvt,1585239703.0,"Oh gosh, thank you. I’m in the U.K. so they’re not testing unless I’m in critical condition. Going to see if I can buy a private test"
COVID19positive,fljkmrn,t3_fp5nz0,1585216664.0,"Wow! I have had some very mild symptoms like tiny tiny sore throat and headaches, slight shortness of breath. I also can’t smell ANYTHING for days now. My nose isn’t blocked whatsoever. Might see if I can get tested since my mum is a healthcare worker and we live in the same house"

COVID19positive,flezwns,t1_fleyu9v,1585094971.0,"Same. But headache and shortness of breath can also be signs of anxiety. But a part of me semi hopes that this is it and I just have an extremely mild case. I do think it’s just anxiety though. Try to relax, try some breathing exercises. I noticed that when I’m distracted from something entirely different, I don’t feel short of breath. But when I’m thinking about it I can defo feel it. Plus, my headaches go away with painkillers. Have you tried checking if you have a fever or something"
Coronavirus,fleagfn,t1_fldtsr9,1585080627.0,Lmao

COVID19positive,fle1c3g,t1_fldzq0d,1585075731.0,"Yes we have to be thoughtful to be people who would be more susceptible :) we’re doing a good thing. I would rather take extra precautions than potentially harm someone. Staying at home is very mentally draining so I get you. Try to sit on your balcony if you have one or sit by an open window, it helped me today"
COVID19positive,fldzmlt,t1_fldyoqd,1585074804.0,Honestly. I’m normally someone who has to leave their house at least once a day or I go a bit crazy
Anxiety,fldz9bq,t3_fo6h6w,1585074604.0,Same!! I’ve had horrible headaches / dizziness and shortness of breath. I find it hard to stand up to even cook myself something. I know these are also symptoms of anxiety but it doesn’t stop me from checking my fever every few hours. And I notice I don’t feel chest tightness when I’m not thinking about the virus.
CoronavirusUK,fldz2j0,t3_fo59fa,1585074501.0,Amazing

I feel dizzy too. I don’t know if it’s just the weeks and weeks of stress from this catching up to me or what. I also have been sneezing around 5-6 times a day + runny nose"
CoronavirusUK,fl593eb,t1_fl58pqp,1584831295.0,It’s disgusting. Stratford Westfield still looking healthy. I unfortunately have to work thanks to my shitty company who only care about profits.
