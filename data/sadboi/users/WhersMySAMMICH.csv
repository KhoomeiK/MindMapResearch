They did say that even though I may not have understood the  bigger point of the issue I had helped with the smaller ones and it was understandable that I couldn't help with the larger issue because its not something I could understand. They more or less needed to vent and needed reassurance that the way they were feeling was normal. I in the end didnt say they needed to seek professional help, I didnt feel there was anyr risk of suicide. They at the end of the discussion suggested they may need to speak with a professional though to help with the bigger stuff."

Fantasy,fncezud,t3_g0x9d4,1586835141.0,I've had the same issue. My introduction to fantasy was the inheritance cycle by Christopher Paolini. These were definitely children's books but the story was fantastic. From there I moved onto Sci Fi and read some of the Dune series by Frank Herbert then the cat whobwalls through walls by Robert A Heinlein. I then moved  back to fantasy but haven't been readying as much as I wanted to in the last 8 years. Same issue as you not being able to find the motivation or the right book. But last month i decided to really look for a starting point and found the Spellslinger series excellent books. My family is full of heavy readers mostly sci fi though so last week my dad finally convinced me to read Ringworld by Larry Niven. I hated the book so now I decided to read Lord of the Rings something I've always wanted to do and am thoroughly enjoying it so far

TwoXChromosomes,f6ouqap,t3_ds7ju5,1573036054.0,"11 years ago I was living with my grandparents due to troubles at home. It was around Christmas I had left school early I didnt feel like going to my last class of the day. I walked through the door of the apartment noticed my grandfather's walker by the door but didnt hear anything. I walked through the apartment looking for him but didnt find him. So I went about my business turned on my xbox, came back out to the kitchen started making some food and looked at the Walker again. At this point I was thinking if his wallet is hear why cant I find him. So I take another look into their room and still nothing. By this point I needed to go to the bathroom. I walk into the bathroom and there he is he had fallen off the toilet and was slouched  into the bathtub face first. Now I consider myself at this stage in my life a relatively in shape individual and with all my strength I could not lift him. It's amazing how difficult it is to move a 160lb limp body. I tried multiple times I dont even know how many times I tried to move him but just couldn't do it. I decide my best course of action is to call 911. They arrive within 10-15 minutes not really sure but it felt like an eternity. I blamed myself for a long time and still do occasionally when I think back to how many times I had walked by the bathroom an never seen him. The doctors had explained it to me that he must have had a minor heart attack while out with my grandma doing Christmas shopping. At that point he decided to go home alone so she could continue her shopping. But once home he had had a massive heart attack while on the toilet which is where he died. When talking about to people I like to tell them he went out like elvis. In the end I am so glad it was me who found him and bot my grandma. I moved back in with my dad and step mom after that rob give my grandma space to heal. The whole ordeal brought me really close to her and I will ne truly devastated the day she passes. 

Thank you for sharing your story. As time passes you will come to terms with what happened and it will make you a stronger person emotionally."

food,f3swujh,t1_f3svffq,1571111221.0,And honestly always source your beef from the same place  try it out first with nothing in the meat its self form the balls and smash them. This ylwaybyoubget truly know the flavour tour beef has gives you a good base to build from. My current method of making smash burgers is little bit of fresh garlic and some apple wood smoked seasoning. I then form that into a ball and smash that onto my cast iron pan but only once it's really hot like almost smoking it's so hot. Once I've smashed it I then add some salt and pepper onto the top then I add some mustard on top of the salt and pepper spreading it with a spoon all the way to the edges of the burger. Wait about a minute and then flip as soon as a flip I add the cheese. And again cook about a minute or so depending on how well you want your meet to be cooked from medium to well. During the time the patties are cooking I am toasting the buns always starting with the bottom bun ( just for timing sake) once the first bottom bun I put may on the bottom bun sole pickles and a slice of tomato. Now because I've already fried the patties in mustard  I dont need any or very little mustard then I put ketchup on the top buns spread it thinlyish to all the edges and that's it
