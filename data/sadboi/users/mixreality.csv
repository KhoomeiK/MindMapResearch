If you don't have to sell, you're paying down principal instead of rent even if the economy tanks, while capping your monthly housing cost (while rents continue up).

Financing gets harder the worse the economy gets. (We bought a sfh with a 0 down, no income verification, sub prime loan when we were 21....in 2006, couldn't do that today) 

After the recession, it gapped up rapidly, if you were still waiting for it to go lower in 2012, it suddenly rose 20%/YOY since, and went up 100% over 5 years. 

Prices are expensive because there are a ton of high paying jobs, and companies keep coming to Seattle because there is a pool of skilled tech workers [that don't want to live in the bay area]. They both pull each other into the area in this perpetual loop."

One thing I'd consider, is potential employment, how many Unity jobs can you find right now? How many from any alternatives you're considering? 

Unity is widely used, and dare I say an industry standard (it wasn't for many years, but its grown into that role for the last 5-7 years). Secondly, support and documentation, Unity has had excellent resources for a decade, basically anything you could want to do, if you break it down to its simplest steps, you can probably find a code snippet in the docs showing exactly what you need. And reference examples, starting examples to learn from for any type of game, or dissect to learn from.

I just got lucky I was using XNA before Unity was conceived, and it funneled me to C#. Then this other engine (Unity) was just starting out, also used C#, and looked similar but had a nice editor, so I eventually switched to Unity. 

Best way to learn is to build personal projects, once you have a few to show as demos you can get an internship, once you have an internship you can go anywhere. It helped I lived in Seattle (tons of job openings) but that was exactly how I did it. I also bought a couple C# books, just general purpose to learn the language.

I think one potential reason is possibility of inflation, we're printing money to fight deflation, fed is buying even junk bonds to free up money for businesses, they're turning around buying up what they can with practically no interest. 

If we end up with inflation, those debts taken out today at record low interest rates will be paid back with diluted dollars in the future.

It allowed us to pounce on the right house when it came on the market....at first we felt like we needed to turn around and buy something to live in, but weren't impressed with anything on the market at the time. Ended up waiting 8 months before the perfect home came up, and it had an offer within hours because it was priced right.

Because we'd spent time looking at numerous houses, even went under contract but bailed after inspection, we knew what we were looking at relative to the market when the right house was listed, and we escalated above the first offer and got it, then countered after inspections and got the price a little lower. The house wasn't about to sit around listed for long...

The thing I realized, the house you want might not be on the market yet....rather than just picking one of the available inventory, it may be better to wait, and be ready to act when the opportunity happens. We sold in April and bought in Nov, were very happy with both sides, got a lot for our house in spring, got a great deal in this past November.

My mistake was calling a sewer replacement company that does the big hydraulic method that bursts through the old pipe while pulling a new line. We paid them $14k, but then after they started they said ""oh, we didn't realize x, y, z, its actually going to cost more than $14k, or we can reline it for the $14k. 

Re-lining is much cheaper, and we'd have saved a lot of money if we'd just called a company that does the re-lining rather than the full replacement that we ended up choosing. They didn't discount the $14k even though they provided a much cheaper alternative than what we agreed to, but their contract basically says get fucked.

You can probably get it re-lined for $3k-$5k depending how long it is. I'd just do that and forget about it. Re-lining pulls a thin walled pvc pipe inside the old one, no digging or anything, it works fine."
