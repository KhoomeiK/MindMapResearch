AskReddit,fmbgs6g,t1_fmbeyc8,1585926049.0,"I've got loads of anxiety but not specifically social anxiety. I'm more socially awkward. Sorry that shopping can be a very stressful experience for you. That doesn't fun. 

One method I use to try and resolve my own problems is getting to the true root issue which isn't always obvious. For example, I hated washing dishes. It used to feel like a punishment when doing them, and I finally realized it's because the water on my hands made me feel exposed and vulnerable which reminded me of my childhood abuse. Once I made that connection I was able to figure out how to deal with it and now I can wash dishes easily. I don't know if this is helpful to you, but hope it is."

CasualConversation,flo4vwp,t1_flo3w1i,1585331659.0,"Has it been working out for you? 

I've tried a similar concept, but I think a big incentive for me would be doing my work with someone else doing their work. And of course I don't have access to something like that. 

Hmm a virtual co-working space ... Is that a thing?"
CasualConversation,flo31o3,t1_flo2gnh,1585330695.0,"One hour at a time is a good way to look at it. It keeps me from getting overwhelmed.

NewParents,fkwgf1j,t1_fkwfbzl,1584591761.0,"I appreciate all the suggestions. There will be a baby shower in the future. I'm thinking more for the pregnancy itself, the celebration in being pregnant.

I was thinking on top of the effectual gifts ill be getting them, I'll also get them a gift card to somewhere (on par with the cash suggestion).  I wonder what is something thoughtful I could do in their early months of pregnancy? More around the celebration of the announcement. Anything she could benefit from as her body is rapidly changing, etc."
NewParents,fkvyrhx,t1_fkvw6cj,1584579604.0,I appreciate the thought. They all actually live together so it's not a worry.
canada,fkhwyty,t3_fiicnq,1584207535.0,"This serves as some justice for assholes trying to make profit off of a global outbreak and people's fears. There should be similar justice for companies who are also doing the same, i.e. raising prices on panic-buying items. Capitalism at its best/worst."
Needafriend,fj5pwgf,t1_fj5oyg5,1583039265.0,Me too! Apparently we're supposed to have the best year ever this year. How's yours going so far?
Needafriend,fj54hah,t3_f7k51r,1583023986.0,"I had an account before that I can no longer access because of reddit 'security' reasons. 

It's a shame though, because I had a lot of people reaching out to me to offer support. I had way more messages than I could keep up with. That's a good problem to have if you're the one in need of help. I wish I had all those people to reach out to now because I'm back at the bottom of the dirty dumps and am extremely lonely. 

Sometimes I didn't really click with the person offering help though. Like, whatever method they're using to help wasn't too helpful or felt generic. So, the back and forth didn't last too long. But then there were others I've had essay conversations with, either because they've been through something similar or our communication styles/needs just clicked. 

There is something about gender though. I think some folks seeking attention are also lacking sexual / romantic intimacy, and reaching out to the desired gender is kind of like getting validation. And we all need validation. Me, in any shape or form, please."
depression,fj481xn,t1_fj3mbgp,1583002387.0,"It's always nice to hear these kinds of things. Thank you. I honestly don't hear it enough. 

Even the folks I help out take it for granted. But I don't do it for the thank-you's. I do it because I've been on the shit end enough to not want it to happen to others. It's just really nice to be genuinely appreciated every once in a while."
depression,fj3ljpu,t1_fj3f815,1582987162.0,"I appreciate the suggestions. I too had no idea I was suffering from ptsd until a therapist who specializes in it brought up the possibility. I did start EMDR, but my trauma isn't based on particular incidents, but rather the childhood as a whole. So, going over a few traumatic experiences that I remember doesn't help me much, unfortunately. So I stopped it. 

Aside from therapy and ptsd and depression and anxiety, a lot of it is heightened now because of my circumstances. Not getting any call backs for jobs. Struggling to survive, knowing I have so much potential, knowing I'm well suited for all the jobs. This is what it most troubling me these days, which isn't something I can control. All that schooling and money, and no job in the field. And the reason I'm out of a job is because I stood up for myself and for others  against an extremely toxic environment at my previous job in my field. 

I guess good guys don't finish at all, not just last. The universe keeps telling me that my efforts won't pay off, not matter how hard I try, I'm forever struggling."
dropdeaddiva,fiufp26,t3_d9au52,1582740517.0,"Earlier seasons, everyone's makeup (except Stacy) on the show was exactly the same and horrible. I find it very inauthentic and annoying to have characters in full makeup and hair when in bed in the mornings. But we associate the non-makeup face on Jane as the real Jane, and the makeup version as Deb. So there's a chance it could be that we shouldn't ever see Jane without makeup to reinforce the idea."

Oh, I'm so sorry to have annoyed you about my depression that had hit an all time low that I needed to call someone at a hotline made specifically for times like these. Oh, well. Your moment of frustration is obviously way more important than my suicidal week of hell.

depression,ficobfr,t1_fhe6zy4,1582353228.0,This happens to me. Even reading your comment took me a few tries. It's one thing to recognize that low self esteem is just the depression talking and it's not based on facts. But they're starting to become facts. I forget my point all the time mid sentence. My brain shuts off and sometimes I don't end up remembering what I was going to say and feel like an utter idiot. I feel like I'm starting to become dyslexic. I have a hard time reading. I often don't read words in order these days.
depression,ficmwt7,t1_fhf8uck,1582352549.0,"This happens to me. As soon as I turn off Netflix after binging a show, it takes me a while to remember what the heck I was just watching. Or I like the song on the radio and I'm singing along. As soon as it's over, I can't remember what song it was. Sometimes I don't even remember having conversations. Short term memory is totally shot."
depression,ficlhth,t3_f2qwaw,1582351132.0,"I feel this too much. It's like my brain has slowed down and I'm lagging, while everyone else seems to be whizzing by. It doesn't help that lately I've had tons more losses than wins. I had to leave my job for mental health reasons caused by the workplace. I haven't gotten a single call back for an interview. Other folks in my field are moving up and getting bigger, and I feel like I'm still this little kid waiting to finally grow up and make all the right choices and that good things would follow suit... Even though I've been fairly active in community things, I feel like this life is not worth living. And I'm on anti depressants. I'm also in therapy. But my life circumstances have not changed and I feel like an idiot who has wasted time money and energy on degrees, all for nothing. I have nothing to show for it. I feel so disconnected and so far removed that I can't speak in real time. In person conversations are such work. Even over text or online, it will take me clever to come up with a reasonable, acceptable response. I have to Google those common words I used to know and use in every day conversion. I've reached the point now where I feel there can't possibly be any up from here. Like I've just totally lost the game of life and either want a complete redo or just leave this life for good. That little egotistical voice inside me wants to prove to everyone that I Am worth something and that I Am smart and capable, which keeps me from leaving this life. The most of me feels like it's just a fantasy."
