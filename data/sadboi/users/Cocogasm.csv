Tagged it with: “Hit 90 sober days the day after world bipolar day... a week after a manic episode put me in inpatient. Feel like 2020 is the year to face the music... if so, let’s dance 🕺🏻”

It got a lot of likes and one random instagram friend reached out and said it was nice to see me come out about that, they had been diagnosed a few weeks prior. 

Even with that I notice my recent ex didn’t like it, and all I can inagine is her having disdain for the post and if I am being too ego-centric... will i regret posting this if I want to start drinking again. Will people treat me differently if I’m ‘out’ as bipolar. Is it wrong that I’m seeking validation?? When I posted it I felt strong and didn’t think twice - but now I feel like a phony.
