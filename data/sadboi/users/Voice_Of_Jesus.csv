TrueOffMyChest,fpf2tyo,t3_gco6ff,1588560473.0,I'm truly sorry for your loss. I believe that anyone who desires joy will eventually find it my heart breaks for you and for the pain that your sister went through. I believe that she has found peace and I believe that you will see her again. I love the hope in the little crosses in your sisters picture. Peace radiates  from it.

confessions,flefe3j,t1_fled4nv,1585083338.0,"The main premise of Christianity is that people are fundamentally broken. There's something wrong with all of us. Thankfully we have a savior!

My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him. For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.

relationship_advice,ffaogs9,t1_ff86byy,1579740752.0,I disagree. We can always forgive. We don't have to hang around Abe be abused forever but we do have to forgive. It's better.

relationship_advice,ff80lj3,t3_es5pg4,1579662878.0,Forgive. You should forgive. You should always forgive. You can even let her know she is forgiven when you find the strength to do that. But it's ok to keep a boundary. You don't have to see her in person right now. It's ok to tell her that too.
Christianity,fbpphfb,t3_ee4198,1577023756.0,What a beautiful thing! A good thing.
confessions,fbmbmvh,t1_fbm7j44,1576981381.0,"You make the cross a small thing when you reject forgiveness from Jesus. You must accept it. There is no other way.

Your cousins may never feel comfortable around you. That is an unfortunate consequence of your sin. Jesus can pay the price for your sin but even Jesus can do nothing to undo the fact that you made the choice to abuse your relatives. And that fact has consequences in this broken world.  

Lastly, it is not your job to try to heal these girls. God can raise someone else to heal them but it won't be you.

Go in peace. Love God and love people with all your might in every way and you will do well.

You are forgiven."
