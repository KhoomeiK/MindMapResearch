All i'll leave it with is this: Evidently people do seem to care about the magical sky man and all the other nonsense or you wouldn't have people being kicked out for disputing. Yes i understand that is the price you pay to be a part but that shows that the point isnt the community if they kick you out for not worshiping god who supposedly they dont really care about as much as community.

> All religions do this. All religions try to enforce or otherwise enact their beliefs 

please research Quakers or Judaism. Not all religions proselytise, and the two examples i gave still have community, traditions and values. i'd say that makes them more of a way of life than an activity.

> They did colonize it 

that was completely my mistake. I meant to say what if south africa had been converted to a Jewish (the religion not the ethnicity) country.

> Jews flourished in southern Spain as administrators, moneylenders and bureaucrats for the Muslim conquerors, at the expense of Christians. There is a reason Christendom ran Islam and Jews out of Spain, it didn't just fall out of the sky.

not sure of how this related to my point that we don't know what would have become of these countries in an alternate reality where a different religion was the majority. I gave southern spain as an example of a place where the way islam is practiced is different. but thanks for the interesting tidbit.

ah yes the british colony looting large swathes of south asia, using it as a base to wage war with china and [forcing them to live through a fucking famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943) was a boon to the economy.

In 1987 bangladesh had $24 billion, a far cry from the UKs £100 billion. It's no wonder why bangladesh is worse off now. And it doesn't help that companies come along to these countries and work children to the bone, also hampering potential growth.

>The difference is really that Europe (at the time) was full of Europeans while Bangladesh was full of Bangladeshis, Europeans make Europe, Bangladeshis make Bangladesh.

reads an awful lot like race realism. if you want to say some shit just come out and say it because it would put the Algeria comment in perspective.

> Europeans have probably spent 9 or 10 Marshall plans worth of money on Africa and got nothing to show for it.  

because africans never asked to become europes investment. You can't just dump money into an economy and expect growth, it creates a helpless mentality but more importantly it doesn't provide opportunity for growth. like the teach a man to fish proverb.

Whether or not they do is irrelevant to my point. Which is that is SEEMS like christians take the silly stories to heart.

> Your railing against ""religion"" is really just anti Christian rhetoric big standard lefty dogma.

believe me there is no religion i hate more than islam. As an exmuslim i know how shitty people get treated in it. And i don't subscribe to the ""lefty dogma"" of hating on christians, e.g i like quakers. I believe you need to give people a chance to change as no one is a finished work. idm the more liberal christians who leave people to do their own thing but don't partake in things they find ungodly. for example a christian who doesn't approve of fornication, who doesn't partake in it themselves and doesn't try to force that lifestyle on others is fine by me.

> You absolutely can, you have other cultures which had other religions 

if for example after the roman empire there was a boom in hinduism there is no telling how that cultural shift would have gone. What if jews colonised South Africa, what would the country be like now? the previous religion of a culture can have a great impact on how a religion is practiced when that culture shifts religion. Islam in southern spain, Iraq and Bangladesh are all practiced fairly differently.

>they're moving here not the other way around.

but to what extent does that have to do with religion? I'd argue it's far more due to the impacts of colianism. I'm south asian so i'll use Bangladesh as an example. Bangladesh won a war for independence in 1972. so it's sort of like starting the country from scratch with only 50 yrs to develop. Whereas the uk had since 1497 to start teh british empire, and still reaps many of the spoils. it's no wonder people would move from bangladesh to the UK."

I don't like to share my age online, as far as you're concerned i could be 90 or 19.

Also idk if i'd consider myself socialist but i definitely agree with loads of the finish  socialist systems, at least all the social welfare schemes (free healthcare and higher education).

> pharmaceutical and student loan industries 

I absolutely despise them. Drug companies prey on people who they know they can extort because life is worth more than money (most of the time).

Student loans prey on the young which is hardly fair but idk when else they should go to school. Of course you could stop education b4 uni then pick it up again if you like, but with automation low skill jobs aren't exactly in high demand.

> Your doctor is a pill pusher and best friends with the opiate salesmen he golfs with.  

assuming i'm in the US, classic reddit moment. I live in the UK where out NHS staff are underpaid and overworked, no doubt at the top there's probably some politician or something skimming of the top tho.

> He justifies it because he went to school for 12 years to learn how to Google symptoms into WebMD to diagnose the flu and sprained ankles and autistically memorize the scientific name of every bone and ligament in the human body.

have you ever seen a doctor? Idk what it's like in the US, i know they are largely profit driven so i wouldnt be surprised if they try to go through as many 'customers' as possible. Globally there is an issue of people coming with mild issues, so if at first glance it seems to be mild then it's no surprise they just shrug you off. But when you have a real issue that 12 years of experience comes in handy, you don't want them giving you steroids for a virus. what they learn in school can save your life. it may seem like searching stuff up on webMD to you but their expertise helps them work out what your ailment is and remove false positives (as in one disease may sound like it describes what you have but in reality it doesn't). Whereas if you tried to do it yourself you'd probably get it wrong - especially when considering how many different issues you can have with your body.

> And Your teacher/guidance counselor is trying to convince you to buy into the same pyramid scheme that they got tricked into.

many of my teachers told us to pursue other paths like apprenticeships, we had one kid who wanted to be a rapper and the staff supported that. Maybe you're from a less supportive time or the culture of where you grew up only encouraged the academic route; but not where i grew up.

> 5 years of irrelevant education and Judeo-Marxist propaganda 

sounds like your describing social studies and things of that sort. I never met a single person who pursued that path. It's no where near as common as you make it out to be. Also idk how you think uni works but you are encouraged to evaluate ideas, not blindly support them. You could never get top marks for dick riding Marx. Every single person in my year (i think you call it grade instead of year) at school knew to pick profitable courses if it was money they were after. it seems to me middle class/people with money to burn are the ones picking the courses you speak of.

These days if you want to make real money an education is more and more mandatory. Even getting an entry level job is a struggle, and the jobs in high demand are programmers and engineers, things of that sort.
