EatingDisorders,f6pfc9f,t3_dsekwq,1573055087.0,"Here's what worked for me:

I made a meal plan with my dietician, nothing too wild, just what I thought I could handle. I set my alarm 6 times a day for eating. It's really important to take time to eat, really sit down, don't try to rush it. Try to eat mostly at the same times each day, it'll make it easier for your body to understand when you're supposed to be eating. And don't be to hard on yourself, start out easy. You can't expect to go from eating next to nothing to eating like a regular person overnight. Choose things that are easy to eat for you and that you enjoy eating! Maybe choose some yoghurt and fruit over pancakes for breakfast, a salad instead of a sandwich for lunch etc. Know that in the beginning the most important part is getting used to eating again, both physically and mentally. You can start to eat more and different things once you're getting hunger cues at the right time. You'll just need to settle into a routine first. Whenever I get confused about the right amounts, I just look it up on the Internet. It gets easier over time, just be kind to yourself and your body. It's really all worth it. Hang in there."

sex,f3fnide,t3_dgusqq,1570899744.0,"I'm amazed by the amount of people here who think submissive girls are somehow ""insecure"", ""ashamed"" or even ""less experienced"". Whether or not you're sub or dom has nothing to do with confidence and everything to do with sexual preference and pleasure. In fact, in my own relationship my boyfriend is the dominant one and he used to be very insecure about sex. I've really had to guide him when we first got together, even to figure out what he likes. I'm about as submissive as you can get, and I'm very confident in my sexual ability. I let my boyfriend take control because it turns me on, not because I'm scared to take the lead. If you're a girl and you're just pretending to be submissive because you're ashamed, you might wanna get with someone you feel comfortable around and experiment a bit. Remember, sex is supposed to be fun, not something to be ashamed of or insecure about."
