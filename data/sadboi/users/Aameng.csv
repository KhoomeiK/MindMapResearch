progresspics,fdq9lin,t3_emfg6r,1578660318.0,This is Amazing!! Loving the transformation. Congrats on sticking with it💪🏻💪🏻. Was wondering if you could share some tips for your success. My father is 66 and struggling with finding and accepting that's it's still possible to effectively shed weight(close to 300lbs with diabetes).He thinks hes too old and I am trying to find ways to show him otherwise. What has  helped with your journey? Any feedback on would be very greatly appreciated💜.

OrlandoMagic,fcgm2y0,t1_fcfpaio,1577641613.0,"You have to learn how to be a ride or die fan. Look at the browns they are literal ass year and their fans still find ways enjoy them. Take away from the positives instead of constantly riding so hard on the negative for a change. When we find a few true scorers our team is going to be legit. Just takes some time through development like atentekumpo,luck in the draft like the heats rookies, or the right trade to come along"

Plus if Drake wants to link up with The Weeknd so badly he should park his Ego a little and let Xo shine first.💯 or Do a double album with both versions with Different themes,personas and styles for each🙏🏼yes please"

OrlandoMagic,f8crh09,t3_e06kk0,1574467294.0,These are tight. I like them better than the OJ jerseys. They shoulda went disney fuck it mode and just did a star wars themed Jersey with a blue light sabre going along the front right side. Shoulder to shorts
AskReddit,f7n3yxg,t1_f7lss35,1573883375.0,This is a great mindset. And is especially a healthy perspective for those out there who consider seriously or regularly consider suicide. Just hang on for the ride. Death is coming inevitably. Make the best of what you can until then.

BPD,f6ohazu,t1_f6lqttl,1573017852.0,You are not alone :]. It's part of this journey journey through life to grow as a spirit. I'm trying. Some days are a lot harder than others if I lose the balance in my mind. Feels like nothing can help. Family always has a way of helping to bring me back.
BPD,f6k67vn,t1_f6jarhp,1572905844.0,"You speaking the facts. I used to smoke everyday for five years. 3 times a day morning, afternoon, before sleep. I swore and thought up and down it was helping me relax and not split on people. Sometimes yes but it was just numbing what I was feeling and not really fixing anything. Then if I didnt smoke I would split on people worse and only feel I could communicate that I was sorry if I was high. Long story short I had the strength with help from family and leading by example for a friend struggling with alcohol abuse to stop smoking myself and really focus on who I am without using a mind altering drug 80+% of my conscious being. I'm still growing and it's been very difficult because I know it helpful somedays but not at the rate I was abusing. I have nothing agaisnt it, I just understand I have an  addictive personality/mind and the 24/7 sedated version of me is someone I ultimately was not happy with."

I honestly think their brain is not woke enough to realize they are not in their bed or on their couch at home. So they proceed to be oblivious to how obnoxious they are being to those around them. That shit is a deal breaker if I'm on a date with a girl lmao. I will put 1000 bucks they dont use their blinker when driving either."

OrlandoMagic,etwwwi6,t3_cdwlfs,1563286180.0,"I think the second black one would look great with the green trim being gray instead. The green doesn't really fit Orlando, neither does orange lol but that at least fits Florida. These are just my my personal preference though. I'm sure whatever they choose will be great regardless on the sheer fact alone that they are so different from our normal uni's."
OrlandoMagic,etvvyi8,t1_etv3i6o,1563246137.0,Not a fan of the colors either
OrlandoMagic,etnoakx,t3_cck4bb,1562993831.0,🤢🤮 I think a purple Jersey would be cooler. Blue&Red make that purp. Not many teams rocking that color.
