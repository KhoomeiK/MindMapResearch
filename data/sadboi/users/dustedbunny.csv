Honestly I pay for a psychiatrist, therapist, and life coach. It is a lot, but has been 100% worth it in keeping me progressing and capable of using my friends for normal friend stuff rather than damaging the relationships from being emotional chaos all the time. I acquired these one at a time, but started progressing in my career and keep adding support. I know your finances right now probably won't allow for that, but keep it in mind as you start your career. It is normal to need support so you have to find ways to get it and also to spread it out so you aren't overtaxing your friends. Use campus counseling, campus career counseling, and try to find a free support group you can attend regularly. It will give you some stability and shoulders to lean on. My partner has a large family so I spend a lot of holidays with them and a lot feel less isolated. Online support is great for practical advice, but doesn't feed the more soulful need for human connection so make sure to get out and be social regularly under any pretenses that work for you."

You don't know if there will be a bunch of other people there or if you are getting yourself into a situation where you will be totally alone to deal with some creep. Men don't seem to understand how often women, especially women in their 20s or highly attractive women but honestly even your average middle aged mom, are cat-called, bullied, even groped if they wander outside their safe zones, like walking in cities alone at night.

Or if people are harsh about small mistakes that also will impact your life outside of work. Maybe you can speak with a career coach about jobs that would leverage your skillset in a less intense environment. Don't feel bad about struggling with the complexity though. You work in an industry dealing with the literal most complicated issues that are life or death for some amount of people *and* on a global scale, which means there are almost unlimited variables to take into consideration. Plus, decisions are ambiguous, whereas academic testing or retail is binary in nature sale/no sale or correct/incorrect the type of decisions that would grow from military intelligence are always unprecedented, with consequence, and there are no perfect answers. If you feel like maybe you could grow to like it though, just give it more time.

I read the secret once in my early 20s and thought it was garbage. I read it years later and tried the practice where you envision a unlikely thing but get yourself to actually believe is possible, and it worked BUT it didn't stick. Years later I discovered Esther Hicks on YouTube and her (""Abraham-s"" - whatever, I personally don't care where she says her message comes from as long as it's helpful) way of describing it clarified a ton for me and that has made it more of a lifelong practice rather than magical potion. Regardless of whether it is quantum magic or just trained optimism you can use loa as a jumping point for a lot of personal growth. However, there are some people selling snake oil (you will know them because they arent helpful) but others that have a deeper philosophy that actually can help you reframe your behavior and beliefs. The Secret is like Cliffs Notes, but read some more on Louisa May Hay, Esther and Jerry Hicks, and I sure people here can point you in the direction of many others. The belief comes strong when you try it out on something big and meaningful and it works, but then if you are feeling like a dumpster fire and manifest winning the lottery you probably won't hold yourself in abundance for long until you do some work to clean up the thoughts and habits that got you to the low point. I personally think a lot of people get lost on that point and waste too much time trying to envision catching the big fish when they won't leave the desert. Who the hell knows though, you have nothing to lose by privately practicing believing in the biggest dreams and unlikeliest possibilities.

It is possible your relationship with him may improve over the years, but it is normal for you to feel a loss and hole where that relationship once was and totally normal to feel dejected and unimportant. Unfortunately, you can't change other people; if it has been 5 years and the problem persists you are not likely to get enough resolution from him to really help you heal so you may have to work it out without closure or acknowledgement. Ask your siblings how they are doing and how they feel about the whole thing, if you have other relatives that you have a relationship with make sure to keep in touch. You don't deserve to be treated like shit, but unfortunately men especially aren't often skilled in how they deal with their emotions. He probably isn't at all aware how his behavior is impacting you because he is only thinking on how to experience happiness himself. Since he sounds pretty self involved, I doubt you will be able to get him to acknowledge any responsibility for his behavior toward you. My dad's excuse was always 'you're an adult'. Meanwhile he would rant for hours to me about issues with his parents, but had no sympathy for me that losing my childhood home, grandparents, connection to extended family, and any emotional support from my father was incredibly hard. My sister lashed out a lot during that period too, because she was struggling too and our relationship was never quite the same. I did forge an amazing new relationship with my mom, met some very supportive friends, and met an incredibly supportive partner over the 15 years since.

With medication I have been able to say to myself 'I am not going to think about that right now' and actually stop. It has made being in public, noisy places easier to handle. It has helped me find a healthy relationship without sabotaging it. It isn't for everyone, but if you need it anxiety medicine makes all the difference in the world.

I really have been trying to make big leaps and then dealing with backlash when I can't hold myself there.  It should be easier to incrementally move my way up the scale than what I am doing trying to fast track."

AskReddit,eu4346n,t3_cepcnd,1563436016.0,"Because men are usually encroaching into other people's space with their manspreading not onto vacant seats like women's purses. people aren't angry about the times men spread out into unused space.  I have personally never had a woman jam her purse into my part of a seat or unwilling to move her purse to her space for someone to use of a seat.  However, I don't use much public transport and that is where manspreading happens the most so I am not sure if the purse issue is worse than I realize."

BipolarReddit,etnzcx7,t3_cbqqlj,1563006364.0,"I have bP1 and I experienced this.  It was several days into a manic episode so I thought it was whatever drugs the hospital gave me ( I think Seroquel), but I tried reading and the words were weird but when I double-took they did this wavy thing you describe so it was very obvious it was a hallucination.  It also only happened that one time."
TooAfraidToAsk,etirk6m,t3_cbwpx0,1562858219.0,No.  If you were 13 or 14 then it is fine but at your age there are enormous maturity differences in those ages and a 13 year old is basically still a child whereas you are a teenager.  When you are both adults 3 years will be negligible but now it is predatory.

raisedbynarcissists,ersi2eh,t3_c3qd9p,1561214685.0,"My guess from experiencing some similar emotional struggles recently, though I am not a mental health professional, is that going no contact typically happens at a point of acceptance which means your perspective is starting to shift out of the fog that any of this is normal to realizing how traumatizing and stressful life has been.  I think that causes a lot of easy triggers and overwhelming emotions.  Maybe try journaling if therapy isn't available.  Self help books specific to narcissistic parents may also he helpful."
mentalhealth,ershndf,t1_erscpsl,1561214331.0,"Yeah, it can be really hard to meet compassionate people and even more so if you have experienced relatively uncommon traumas or difficulties because some of the kindest and well intentioned people can be dismissive, skeptical, or hurtful due to their own ignorance, innocence, or inexperience. It is kind of fascinating how people can be toxic by virtue of their own innocence, but I have experienced that too.  Some very well meaning and otherwise kind people lack a level of empathy due to not experiencing any comparible suffering."
mentalhealth,ersc8of,t3_c3p727,1561209360.0,"I am kind of on board with what you are getting at.  Even though my family are deeply self involved people that don't really make an effort to know or understand me they would be devastated if I died, but like do they 'need' me? Need is a term for dependents and I do not have any.  Also, coming from a family of personality disorders the 'you are loved' advice is presumptuous bullshit.  Many people are quite factually not loved because their family does not understand how to feel or express actual healthy love.  The positivists are often blinded to their own privilege and narrow view.  I think a more honest and universal statement is 'you are worthy of love' which is true of everyone and doesn't imply the person seeking support is just oblivious to being surrounded by love and support.  It may be true that some people experience warped perspective and overlook sources of support, but many others are in crisis because they lack healthy relationships by default."

You could try snapping a rubber band on your wrist when you notice you sighed and before deep breathing to try to train your body to be more aware of it, but I don't know if it is worth the hassle."
raisedbyborderlines,eooc1x1,t3_bsbk0y,1558734896.0,"I recently went to my partner's cousin's wedding and was struck by the same kind of thing.  Speeches of adoration and a large loving family with gleeful children running about. If I ever do get married we would have to elope so I could enjoy my own wedding.  My family is small and hateful.  They think of me as antisocial and cruel for staying distant from them, but the reality is that as a result of my parental emotional neglect I spent a lot of time with friend's families or in daycare which helped me see from an outsider perspective and realize very early the way they treat me (or each other) isn't love or healthy. I have sought out healthier friends and colleagues over time which exposes me to more of this and the higher up the love and functioning chain I go the more I feel like a hideous undead zombie crashing the weddings, showers, etc.  Like I shouldn't even be there because I am not part of this vitality or world."
relationships,eooa24d,t1_eompurh,1558733410.0,"You are absolutely worth the effort, but a man that behaves like this is not going to ever give you it.  You are especially the utter minimal effort it takes for a human to adjust their behavior so they are not terrifying someone they allegedly love.  I am so sorry he and your mum before him made you feel so small and insignificant, but you are worthy of being spoken to with respect and consideration, but your first step in reclaiming that right is setting the boundary to walk away from people who cross these lines.  How he is behaving is unacceptable."
raisedbyborderlines,eoo86z3,t3_bsi2lx,1558731929.0,"I had to leave a job because a malignant narcissistic boss was triggering way too many issues. In that same time frame had multiple other weird encounters with other people with traits of a uBPD family member.  Honestly, the best you can do is find a therapist to anchor you through it.  If the person doesn't leave you will likely need to for your own sanity.  It was very grounding to have a therapist to talk to and validate that I was being emotionally abused and in a traumatic situation and it helped me stay focused on getting out.  God it was awful and I am so sorry you're in this. Again. This isn't scientific, but I personally suspect some part of them recognizes we 'see them' and it triggers them.  Because in talking to other people you meet a lot of people that don't pay much attention to them and think oh she's a bitch but that's the extent of it.  I think we give off a 'oh hell no' vibe that makes these people desperately engage us in some crazy manipulation tango in their own effort to show themselves its us not them."
