I went through my first purge a couple of weeks ago and since then I've been doing better because I don't want this. But as I get better I start questioning whether or not I just made it up because I want to be the victim and since I'm doing overall better even though I have my bad days too I feel like this getting better isn't really recovery, but simply me not being silly. 

I'm starting to question whether or not this is just the ""monster"" in my mind yet again trying to take control but it feels like I can't ask for help because I really haven't gotten far enough to deserve it.

At the same time, I'm now aware that if I COULD ""just get over it"" I wouldn't even be here and compulsory thinking my problems aren't bad enough, if I was fine I wouldn't WANT to get worse in the first place."
