My kids were no longer bringing me joy, because the depression was just.. Stronger. It was impossible to believe that the future could be good, when only so little of the past was. I woke up every morning, mourning the fact that I woke up at all. I would still take care of my duties as mom, go to work, cook, clean take care of kids (by letting them just watch t.v.) and felt absolutely nothing the entire time other than anger for still living. I prayed every single night, for sickness to take me away. To kill me in the night, so my kids don't have to live through another suicide. I kept going to therapy, I kept working through trauma memories. Needing something more, but not having insurance. Drowning. Suffocating on life itself. I've lost all my will to fight time and time again. I fucking love my kids, though. I want them to NEVER feel this way for this long. So I keep going to therapy, I'm going back to school, I'll keep working and celebrating them.

I'll share something a wrote during a flashback and me finding my center in that panic. 

I've done it again.
Opened my door willingly, 
And with a grand, cheerful smile
Welcomed fear into my home.

I love how he glides himself over 
My wooden floors.
The base that once seemed so strong
And grounded.
But he moves so swiftly over them,
And suddenly they seem weak and rotting.

My floors,
But then when I look up to him
He is beaming with confidence
The fire of his ego is so,
Inviting, almost comfortable

Almost

He loves to walk through every room
When he first arrives
And blindly, 
I always follow behind
As if, he will take me to my only
Desired place

Today, I looked away
For one brief moment, I found my heart, 
Again, and I looked away,
And at my burning house

With horror, and shame
I began to crumble
I stopped in my tracks, 
And wept

No longer were there pictures in my frames, 
Of a once happy family
Nor the many knick-knacks
Of my memory past
The rugs that had held the feet of all my babes, rising to ash and dust
The kitchen, the belly, decaying before me
My home, is crumbling to a state it had reached before
And while I wept, he destroyed more
And I realized I would have to start all over
Again.

But today is the day my trance has been broken
For he always leaves, after he visits every room
His flame has burnt out to my eyes
Rather, stolen by my own soul
And tomorrow I will rebuild
Although, not blind
My eyes wide open"

They lived right across the street from a junior high school, one that I have played at many times and even learned to ride my bike there. So, we get bored and decide to go wander around and play on the tennis court. While we are running around I told her there was a way to get on the roof of the school from the back. We would just have to jump a fence. Obviously, she agrees, and we get down to our scheming. There is just one door behind this fence and a tall ladder, we start in on the ladder and it's locked. So, we just start acting goofy and making each other laugh when she does a skit involving the door. Miraculously, this door is unlocked. Mind you, this is around 6 p.m. on a Saturday. So, we go inside thinking we are about to have a blast. It's the culinary arts class. My bff is doing yet another skit at the teachers desk, I'm laughing my ass off and she throws open one of the desk drawers. We both fall silent as this drawer is full of cash. They were having a fundraiser and that Friday had been the last day to bring money. All the details were there. With the money and checks. So we just start grabbing. We took everything. Bolted out, hopped the fence and ran straight to the alley behind my aunt and uncles house. We burn the checks, burn the manilla envelop and count the cash. Over 300 bucks.

AskReddit,f9vyvnc,t1_f9v3b3b,1575683468.0,"I had a similar experience. My son's father still had his tickle me elmo from when he was a kid and gave it to our son. After we split and me and my son got an apartment, we were playing with elmo in the living room. My son was about a year and half. Still non verbal. Anyway, everytime you push the button he laughs harder and harder. Well, on this day I pushed the button for the third time to get the super hard laugh that my son loved and instead got a deep mumbling voice saying something then followed by my son's name. It never happened again. But as a newly single mother it freaked me the fuck out."

John_Frusciante,f9ltttx,t1_f9ltmcp,1575431840.0,"P.s. my grandfather died in 91 i was born in 94. I never got to meet him, but have felt a strange connection to him my entire life. John's music has literally made me feel close to my grandfather. And that is a god given talent. His music is pure beauty."
John_Frusciante,f9ltmcp,t3_e5ko7y,1575431685.0,"His music has taken me on a entire journey. One time I played Before the Beginning for my brother and right in front of me was a painting my grandfather had done. I just started bawling, because for the first time I saw my grandfather's art and I understood it. I had seen that painting a thousand times. But I never truely saw it until it was coupled with John. His music inspired me to start writing, got me through the worst depression of my life and even aided in me pulling the scarf off of my neck. 
I could never really tell anyone what his music has done for me. As a mother, a sister, a lover and daughter. 
I just wish I could give him a big ol' hug and tell him thank you."
abusiverelationships,f956p8c,t3_e3q8m8,1575120513.0,"But I cant. Not with kids involved. Not when we were never married and he won't let me adopt his daughter after her mother died. My daughter.  I have to keep pushing through. Hopefully one day, he will get therapy. Hopefully one day I will be free from years of torture. Even my therapist is lost in this mess. She can't even see a way out of this where I can get custody. Thus sucks. Loving an abusive man sucks."
houseplants,f8bge3j,t3_dzw65a,1574436255.0,Anytime we need to go to the store and my boyfriend asks what we need. Anytime we're bored and he asks me what I want to do. Anytime I have an hour to myself. Anytime my kids are being annoying and I'm like saddle up its boring time. Anytime I'm stressed. Anytime I open the closet door and see 10+ empty pots. I literally have a thousand excuses to buy plants. Lol

TrueOffMyChest,f6z2cpi,t1_f6z1mq2,1573307054.0,"Still wish I could ""feel like everyone else"". I endured a lot of horrible trauma throughout my life starting at birth. Living with flashbacks and mood swings is the fucking worst. But I'm soooo sympathetic to any child. My own step daughter lost her mom to suicide right after her third birthday. Our combined situations have made me realize that I'm a nurturer by nature. I was born to be a mother, and I have lots of experience in the worst that can happen in childhood. I feel like i can read children so well and can jump in to help. I would love to be a teacher."

Since I didn't understand that you could kill yourself, but i used to pray to God every night to take me. I'm 25 now and my last attempt was a year ago. I've been in therapy for about 8 months, and soooo much change. Keep up the fight, my friend."
