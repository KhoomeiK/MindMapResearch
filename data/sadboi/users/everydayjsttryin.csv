The world's a mean place but not completely knowing that your brothers, dogs and this group are 100% behind you and the shitty moments will come but so will a few good ones. You come back & tell us how it's going. As I will. Because many days you feel alone but just knowing their are others out there feeling similar to you helps to close that loneliness hole a bit."
depression,fj6lvx7,t3_fbs91x,1583075154.0,That sounds so nice. I keep telling myself I need to be one of those people who just doesn't care so much. But at the same time I tell myself I don't want to be like that.  Focusing just on today though I'm just going to sit in the sun and try to forget the worries. Thanks for the reminder of life's blessings.

depression,fiufenf,t3_f9tg2o,1582740361.0,That is GREAT news. Good on you for staying the course and being an inspiration. Congrats !
depression,fionirf,t3_f8q6pt,1582586721.0,"Not to be unsympathetic but even we people reading your journey care about you. You may not feel it right this moment but there is only 1 of you. Which makes you the most important, most unique copy of you that there is. Just think about that. Whatever family you have love you for YOU. YOU will mever exist again. I hope YOU continue to grace us with your 1 of a kind unique personality and soul that I for one feel. So far away but yet so close by."
depression,fiaqjhy,t3_f791jw,1582306450.0,"Yes to this, and confusion of wondering am I depressed or is this just the way it's suppose to be ? You ask others and it's either no response with a confused look like ""why are you depressed?"" or the dumbass comments of snap out of it.  Either way it sucks."
depression,ezwra3a,t3_cpvwhh,1568223220.0,"Your depression is just that. Yours. As we are all unique you can't just tell someone ""really"". It's like a puzzle that each of us goes day to day trying to solve. It sucks and ALOT of times all you want is to hear /read that someone else feels similar to you."
