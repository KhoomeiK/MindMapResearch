AnimalCrossing,fko7l5j,t3_fjp7k4,1584381667.0,"I preordered it but I bought one on Friday bc I wanted to put the screen protector on my switch, so my preordered just arrived. If there’s someone who lives in a place where they’re all sold out, I’d love to offer it here before I just return it to Target. I’m just trying to break even so I’ll just ask for retail + shipping to your place. DM if you’re interested."

AnimalCrossing,fh83vyc,t3_f1sk3x,1581351457.0,I’m dying to get this bag but it’s on amazon Japan and I can’t read the site well enough to sign up for an account. And I don’t even know if it would ship to me in the US if I did have one. 😅 Sorry if this has been mentioned somewhere else.
depression,etkhbrw,t3_c2fuf3,1562898015.0,"Oh honey I feel you. I am seriously going THRU it and every day feels like the biggest challenge. I have a shitty job where all I’m doing is yelling at kids who don’t listen and it feels like I can never do anything right. Then I come home and get it all over again from my parents. And I’m like just trying to survive but they don’t get it. They’re of the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality and I’m like, a lot of us with depression don’t even have bootstraps to begin with!!! I get so mad I feel like I could rage for a million years but mostly I just get so sad and want to cry for a million years as well.

I know it’s rough but just try to take it a day and a time, know that you’re not alone, try your best, and look for those small moments in each day like when you saw a cute dog or when someone held the door for you - whatever cliche thing. There’s some good in this garbage world and there’s good people and there will be good songs and movies and books and it won’t feel like this forever."
JapanDating,eta51vy,t1_er2w9rt,1562612365.0,"An opportunity came up on our trip where he could tell something was wrong, and I wasn’t planning on telling him, but he kept asking and asking. So I finally told him I liked him, but I knew he didn’t like me back and it was fine, I just needed time to get over it. He was really cool in the moment and tried to comfort me. I told him thank you for being so nice because I knew I had put him in an awkward spot, but he brushed it off like that was the most ridiculous thing in the world. 
He talked about how he liked me too and I’m like... dude I don’t think you get it. He mentioned a girl back home in Japan and how they broke up when he came here, so for a while, I thought that maybe he did like me too, but would need a while to stop having feelings for her. It was a very confusing situation. 
The rest of the trip went great and we had so much fun, but now we hardly talk anymore. I’m bitter and sad so I just need time to move on, I guess. I just wish that it didn’t feel like this perfect dream I had once, and nothing more. But しょがない…"
