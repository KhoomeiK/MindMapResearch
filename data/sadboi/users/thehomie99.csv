architecture,fhkaztj,t1_fhk4ym8,1581675615.0,"don't worry man i legit went through the same thing , the  "" i can't believe i left arch "" is too relatable , thing is architecture is a beautiful career , but from what is asked from you and what is rewarding in it , trust me its really not worth it , and im not talking about the whole work you got to do by yourself , but also how much money you have to pay.
i became mentally ill by the end of it all man . 
i dont blame my parents ( well only when they didnt want me to leave at 2nd year ) because it wad my decision , and the only thing i got pissed off/regret was all the money they put on me . 
and trust me , there are hella of possibilities in CS than just sitting on a computer and designing a building , you could go into AI , have a stable profit and you could create and app or a website as a passive income . it s an awesome career if you ask me .

architecture,fhjfu5j,t3_d96qiu,1581645154.0,"sorry for the late reply , i dont want to break you down or anything or discourage you . but like your health is more important . architecture ( to where i live atleast  i don't know about your surroundings) is a failed investment . coming from a 3rd year dropout .
that was the biggest step i ever took i even wanted to leave at 2nd year because it was driving me insane but my parents kept nagging on me . by the third year i legit considered suicide . 
it felt weird i was spending a lot of money on a career that might not have any bright future or you could say not well paying ( but it also depends on you , your experience and your luck )
so i had to leave 
causes :
1 - i had a financial problem in my 3rd year so i felt sympathy for my parents by leaving and felt free and happy
2- paying a lot to earn very little ? nah 
3- depressing . only if you wanna get rid of your mental health i would advise it


i used to be the kid who loved architecture and trust i still do i miss the shit i used to do but like all the stress and bull shit history courses i fucking hated thay shit and you had dumb colleagues aswell with A while i used to get C which didnt make much sense .



i had a major downfall when i left like no kidding i sat in bed for 2 days straught no esting nothing just wanted to disappear but then came happiness and freedom ..
anyways i hope you get what you want and you ll reach somewhere ."
