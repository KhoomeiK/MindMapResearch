Like, you tell your friend you can't go out tonight because your cat is throwing up.  Her answer? ""Lame.""

But honestly, this person should have responded to you with, ""oh bummer, but I understand"" and not ""that sucks"" or ""lame"""
CoronavirusWA,fqcqmck,t1_fqciu1w,1589265756.0,"Best way to understand it is like this:

To avoid getting malaria when camping outside where malaria is endemic, you use a mosquito net.  The mosquito net doesn't block malaria, but it prevents the mosquito that's carrying malaria from biting you.  

So this virus is very tiny and can pass through a dry cotton mask.  However, the virus is usually hitching a ride on respiratory droplets.  So, if you cough while wearing a mask, the mask significantly cuts down on the amount of respiratory droplets that make it out of the mask.  Different masks have different levels of effectiveness.  

And you are correct, it's to lower the amount of virus being spewed out into the world by contagious people.  

Because fabric masks aren't air tight, they won't prevent you from breathing in the air around you... but they ""catch"" moisture droplets from your coughs or talking or singing, so they cut down on the amount of virus you release into the world :-)

Hope that helps!

P.s. if you're looking for a fairly effective DIY mask, look for the stapled shoptowel YouTube video.  A researcher at... North Carolina?  I can't remember, but it's in the description, tested his design out & made some mods... Doubling the shop towel made a very good mask.  The reason is shop towel is a non woven material."

I water my snake plant once a month during winter.  More often during its growing season.  I bought two majesty palms recently and immediately watered them because they were bone dry.  I put them in the shower so it would ""rain"" on them & hopefully knock off any loose bugs & the slow watering would rehydrate the soil.  Parched plant soil ofyrn becomes hydrophobic, so the water runs off the soil like a duck's back.  In that case, put the pot in a bucket and water it... the water will run through into the bucket, and after awhile the soil will rehydrate.

As in, take a group of 20 year olds, give them the virus, lock them up together for a month, release them when recovered or dead.

The idea there being that you can get anyone outside the cloister sick.  It's not a bad idea if the fatality rate were lower and there were no long term consequences to getting sick.  

*Early on*, it sounded like young people barely got sick, if at all. If that were true, you could take all children under 18, send them to COVID-19 camp, have them get sick and recover. Return them home, so they could go to school and not transmit infection.  They could see grandparents, play at playgrounds, etc.  That would lower the risk for older folks, not increse their risk.

Of course, COVID-19 is not mild, it can affect and kill people of all ages, and so *deliberate infection is folly.*

Anyhow, I am writing all this because I was bothered by the assumption that the guy didn't care about older people, when deliberate infection & subsequent isolation of the infected would create herd immunity for everyone, helping save older people.

Walz announced weeks ago that our Stay at Home order isn't there to prevent everyone from getting sick, it's there to slow the rate of infection, to buy time for our healthcare system to ramp up supplies & beds.  We've done a good job at this.

However, there are only so many healthcare workers, so there is a hard limit on how many people can get sick & need hospital care at a time, without the quality of care for everyone (even non COVID-19) declining.

By doing what we're doing, we have a slow trickle of ICU admissions & deaths (or fast if it gets into acute care facility like a nursing home).  We have to keep it up.  The minute we start allowing restaurants & bars open, or family get togethers, we get increased transmission.

We have about 5.6 million people in our state.  7,234 have tested positive.  We've had 428 deaths, of which 345 were residents of long-term care/assisted living.  That means only 83 people have died outside of those in care facilities.

If we take a more optimistic estimate, that the overall infection fatality rate (IFR) is only 0.3%, then currently only 27,666 Minnesotans have been infected.  If 100% of Minnesotans get infected, our total deaths would be 16,920 (in a non-overwhelmed situation).

I'm not sure how many ICU admissions and deaths (I think like 80% of covid19 cases that go on the vent, die on the vent) our system can handle on a monthly rolling basis.  Let's say it is 1,000.  For 16,920 deaths, that's 16.9 months.  Once a very high percentage of the population has recovered, we'll get a bit of herd immunity (assuming you can't get it again within 24 months), so we wouldn't see *everyone* getting infected.

The higher the IFR rate, the more we have to slow the rate of infection to not get overwhelmed.  The lower the IFR, the opposite is true.  Due to exponential growth, I could see a constant wave of loosening restrictions, tightening them back up, loosening them, etc...

To your question, ""what's the point if the order if people aren't expected to follow it.""

I think it is hoped everyone will follow it, but that if people break it, they will do so sensibly and not endanger others by engaging in risky behaviour (like having people inside their house in an enclosed airspace for several hours as one would for a dinner party).  Having five people in socially distanced chairs around a firepit is a much, much lower risk activity than a dinner party. 

 It is like the ban on alcohol at state parks.  How many people have a beer with their brat whilst camping at a state park?  It's not allowed, but not enforced, unless you start affecting others (loud or obnoxious behaviour from drinking too much).  

Btw, I am not condoning breaking any rules or laws here, I am merely trying to illuminate the situation, with the goal of helping others understand what is going on in a normally law abiding citizen's head, when they break a law/rule."

I look at it like golf.  Our state decided golfing is an acceptable risk.  I drove by several courses recently and everyone was standing roughly four to ten feet apart.  So, I look at bonfires (NOT cookouts where food/utensils are shared), as a similar act.  Not everyone has the money to play golf.   But most have enough for a $10 chair they can walk to their neighbor's.  

I wear a mask and gloves to every store, despite the fact that I see very few other people doing this.  I limit my grocery trips to once a week.  I don't dilly dally at Home Depot if I have to get something there.  But I do feel like the increased risk from three to six people, socially distanced, around a fire pit is acceptable in our current situation, despite being against the rules.

The same goes for used items.  A buyer pays $21 for a pair of shoes + shipping.

They either bought a $21 pair of shoes w/ free shipping, or a $10 pair of shoes with $11 shipping.  A lot of those buyers are going to feel better about the $21 pair of shoes w/ free shipping because they usually underestimate the cost to ship.

If they bother to think about it at all, it might be like ""I paid $21 for shoes, but the seller gave me free shipping, which is probably like $5, so my shoes actually cost $16""

For me, any listings that don't say smokefree, or don't have bust & waist measurements (when relevant), cause me to have to make the extra step of asking ""is this smoke free"" or ""bust & waist measurements please, thank you!"" If it's amazing deal, I will take the time. If it's only OK, I may just move on.

I like to make bundles, because it makes the shopping cost more palatable to me.  However, you have to return the whole bundle if you want to return a single item.  So, I really want to do my due diligence to make sure each item will hopefully work out.  

When I shop, I basically will be looking at a category, say, maxi dresses.  I sort price low to high, then start at the lowest and keep looking.  If I find one that looks appealing, I click on it, and see if it would work for me.  If it does, then I go to that seller's closet and start going through all of it to see what else might work for me.  If I don't find anything else, or I find something, but no measurements, I may skip out on the original item because it's too much w/ shipping.

poshmark,foif2yx,t1_fohbti5,1587785165.0,"I've saved a lot of money by buying clothes on Poshmark.  It's also allowed me to have items I couldn't afford, like a $400 cashmere wrap.  I have a pretty sensitive nose.  I'm not allergic, but I don't care for strong fabric smells.  I went to a relatives and my beach towels were washed at their house.  Wow!  The smell was so powerful, and remained despite being laundered at my home afterwards.  

Not everything from Poshmark smells bad, nor does it have stains or holes.  But, some items do smell & some do have undisclosed holes or stains.  I'm not going to let the occasional disappointment keep me from buying on Poshmark.  However, I will do my best to reduce the chances of getting stinky items, and I do that by letting the buyer know I'm sensitive to odors.  

If you run into another person who is trying to remove odors, the #1 solution is time.  My stinky towels have zero detergent smell, 4.5 years later (I don't know when they became stink-free).  

Second to waiting...

Wash laundry.
Wash laundry w/ Dr. Bronner's Castile soap.
Hang to dry in sunshine.
Leave in sun/fresh air until smell fades, if the garment can handle that amount of UV light.  If too much sun would damage item, hang in shade.  

(Other tips are spraying with white vinegar or vodka, or bagging up with activated charcoal.)

Smells come from a *physical object* that lands in your nose.  There are a finite amount of those objects in a garment (if the source of the smell is gone).  The trick is to hasten their removal.

The other thought I had is washing an item with Dawn.  I use that on my dog when he rolled in dead animal.  It was a horrific smell, and Dawn cleaned his fur very well.  I also cleaned a fur garment that I was repurposing.  It was from the 1940s and smelled strongly of smoke, perfume and who knows what else.  If you wiped your hand on the fur, it would come away smelling stinky & feeling oily/dirty.  Dawn cleaned it very well!

Smokers have an almost zero sense of smell.  So even if they store stuff separately, they have no idea if the stuff they source smells, unless it has a really strong odor.  I have a very sensitive nose :-(  Generally I try and be very upfront, so they know I will return it if it smells.

laundry,fo3xrhx,t3_g5k1zm,1587494746.0,"To dry clothes inside, you will want to have dry air flow over the garment.  My recommendation would be to only wash a few articles at a time, so you don't create too much humidity at once & slow down the process. If they take too long to dry, the stuff that causes bad smells could develop.  

After hand washing, try spinning, wringing, or pressing them dry if the garment won't be damaged by those processes.

To avoid purchasing anything, hang up clothing in your door frame.  Hook the hanger onto the door molding.  Other spots: shower curtain rod (only if bathroom air is not humid!), hang from ceiling fans/light fixtures (if they can support the weight safely), in front of an open window on a dry/sunny day

Inexpensive purchases would be a folding clothes drying rack or a tension shower rod (it can support light weight). Or, a drying line.  I use this:
 https://www.rei.com/product/807452/sea-to-summit-lite-line-clothesline it's strong, and has little beads on it that lock tight to hold your clothes, so you don't need hangers to dry your clothes.

Do you own a fan?  If you do, point the fan at your drying clothes to help them dry faster.  Fans are inexpensive to buy.    If it's still cold where you are, hang clothes over a hearing vent.  The dry airflow will help.

If you want to spend more money, a dehumidifier will really help.  If you live in a basement apartment, a dehumidifier may be necessary.  :-(

Lastly, consider only wearing/using fabrics that dry quickly.  Light synthetic clothes tend to dry quickly.  Paper thin fabrics as well. Avoid wearing cotton jeans or things with thick waistbands.  Do you have outdoor apparel/hiking clothes?  The REI Sahara pants dry super fast.   You could probably out them on wet & take a walk outside and your body heat would dry them..!

P.S. For washing, search for camping/backpacking washing devices eg: 
https://letscampsmore.com/washing-machine/
REI also sells a drybag meant for washing, the ""Scrubba"" but I think you could find the same thing for less money, or make one yourself.

TL;DR:  Wash & dry under five items/ten undergarments at a time.  Hang in location that gets max airflow.  Point fan at clothes."

You can intentionally do this to create fabric from knit wool sweaters:

If you want to avoid felting a sheep product, just avoid doing anything the article recommends ;-D.  I would follow the recommendations of others here and try using a dog brush if it's not too bad.

If it is very bad, you can shave/shear off the fur/wool and use that wool to stuff a pillow.  Wool has properties that make it excellent as bedding material :-)  it's just too expensive to be used as pillow stuffing normally.  

Also, maybe after shaving/shearing the wool off down to an inch, you will find it's not matted to the bottom, and you can use it as a sheared sheepskin?  I know when I cut a matt out if my dogs fur, it's usually not matted to the skin... still 1/2"" of fur below the matt.

Some thoughts:

Rabbit hides are very thin and tear easily.  This also means if they aren't stored properly, there's a good chance they will be dry and tear if they are agitated.

A furrier typically cleans a fur coat using sawdust or cornmeal or something else dry & absorbent.  That is mixed with a solvent (eg something related to gasoline) or some similar chemical.  The coats and the cleaning mixture are put together in a large drum.  The drum spins just like a regular dryer, gently mixing the solvent soaked sawdust with the coats, and lifting the dirt off the fur, the hide below, and cist linings.  Then they are put in a drum with holes, and left to spin in that, to remove all the sawdust.   They are blow dried to remove any leftover bits, the lining is steamed, and lastly the fur is glazed.  

There's a great video that shows this process: https://youtu.be/LcXkEhnA760

A coat that is too delicate could be cleaned by hand as shown in this video.  As you can see, there are a lot of steps, and due to solvents being used, environmental standards thst must be followed.  All this means is that paying a furrier to clean your coat is not cheap..!

You may not wish to spend that kind of money, or you may find it's worth it, for sentimental reasons.

If it is just dusty, I would recommend vacuuming it carefully.  Spritz it after with vinegar or vinegar water mixture, and let that dry.  Maybe out it outside on a breezy day.  Sun isn't good for fur or leather, BUT the sun is very good at cleaning & odor removal. I would say it is worth it, to put the fur coat out in full sun for one day.  The sun & fresh air should freshen the coat up.  You can also steam the coat as well.

If it is truly dirty (eg has smoke film from being worn by a smoker or years of smoky bars), then you will want to find a seam ripper and detach the lining from the bottom hem.  This will allow you to inspect the condition of the rabbit hides.

If they are torn or cracking in multiple spots, you may find wearing the coat damages it further.  If it's very minor, you can glue a backing on the hides to strengthen them.

Sometimes it is the lining that smells the most.  You could replace the lining, but if you have to pay someone, it may not be worth it.

Lastly, if the coat is beyond repair, you can salvage the fur.  Remove the lining & all thread.  Clean the fur in whichever manner is needed.

I bought a very stinky vintage coat made of marmot and took it apart:  removed the lining, removed the arms.  There were only one or two spots where the hide was tearing. The hides are thicker than rabbit. I cut the arms so they were two flat pieces of fur.  

One piece I washed in a wash basin with Dawn dish soap repeatedly until the water was clear, then rinsed VERY thoroughly.  I placed it on a towel, rolled it up, stepped on it to press the moisture into the towel.  I repeated this with several towels.  Lastly I clipped it to a hanger and hung it outside to dry.

For the other arm, I followed a different process which didn't work as well, so I won't share it here.  The fur washed in water did shrink upon drying, so if you want to avoid that, you'd want to staple the hide to a board and let it dry there.

Furriers will spray tanned hides with water to relax the leather, then staple to a board to stretch it out.  It dries in its new size.

If you decide not to use your coat as a coat, you can use the fur for many things (as long as it's not crumbling apart).  You can make a teddy bear, fur trim for boots, hats, gloves, coat cuffs etc.  You can make toys for cats.  You can make a pillowcase, mini blanket etc.   Lots of ways to repurpose fur, if the coat is beyond repair.

Hope this helps!  :-)
