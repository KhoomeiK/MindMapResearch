Matt decided he couldn’t do the fake anymore and because of that he blew Rudis career opportunity, as well as his own. I saw something different (not positive) in Bri during the time she was feeling “something is off” with Chris. It’s like her shell kind of cracked and we saw a detached part of her she kept off camera prior to this. I hope her and Chris make it as a couple because I don’t believe they have the talent to be “stars” in the music world."

One suggestion. Get a notebook and create a page for the big issues in your life:one page might be titled Kids, another $, another Self care, etc. Create as many category pages as suits you. Then, each day log ONE THING you did in this area, and ONLY one thing you still need to do. Just get it on paper. After a week or so, you go back and see the actual progress you are making.
