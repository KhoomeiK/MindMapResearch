I‚Äôve never stayed up all night before. Little me felt odd witnessing this new day because the day that I‚Äôve been struggling to sleep in was now gone. Now that I work all the time pulling all nighters, it‚Äôs not as magical, but I miss that feeling of seeing a new sun rise for the first time."

ArtCrit,fmal0he,t3_ftsz5n,1585897813.0,"I don‚Äôt know a thing about paint so take this suggestion lightly! 

I notice there‚Äôs a lot of green in the skin tone and it is repeated within the simple green background; this makes the portrait look flat in my opinion. What if you brought in more reds to complement those greens? Darken those shadows with deep reds and maybe even blues, but if anything, maybe paint over the background with a shade of red to give contrast to the green on the face?

That‚Äôs my two cents! You‚Äôre doing great and this is honestly so inspiring. That brushwork is stellar. Makes me wish I could paint! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Meditation,fm5ni4w,t1_fm5jba3,1585776293.0,"In a way. Thoughts come and go without our will and can affect us emotionally, but they do not define us...unless we allow them to. When you experience painful thoughts, allow yourself to witness their affect on you without judgement. 

Specifically, acknowledge that you are experiencing this pain rather than letting it define your overall sense of being; this is the goal of meditation. The more you block your thoughts, the more they will build up and clog your emotional state. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to fully accept them as they come, just like any other thought we may have. Allow your mind to flow like the ocean, then you can be in the present moment; you can simply just be. I define this as self love.

Through this validation within yourself, these thoughts will not affect you as much since they are a wave of many in the vast ocean of your mind. You just have to keep reminding yourself that even though they can bog you down at times, it does not have to become a part of you. 

This is not an easy process, but I believe you can find inner peace ‚ù§Ô∏è"

awakened,fj4n2nd,t3_fb884t,1583012114.0,"Man this is so cool to read. I think you‚Äôre making so much sense. Every thought is mine. Every scenario I reflect on is made by my imagination. 

These scenarios are a simulation of reality that I create in my mind, and I can choose to make it a external reality if I believed in it. Of course like you said. outside forces can affect it, but ultimately we have the power to decide what‚Äôs real and not real by the voices (or scenarios) we choose to listen to. 

I‚Äôm new to all this, but every day I think I understand more and more. I hope to find peace within myself by realizing I have the power to be who I want to be. I have the power to be free from limiting my self worth to a social expectation or troubled thought that I choose to affect me. 

What I love is that I‚Äôm aware of even choosing to resonate with this post; I‚Äôm aware of that thought process. I‚Äôm not blind to let it consume me and become a part of my ego. It‚Äôs simply a decision that I choose to resonate. And I think it‚Äôs because I yearn for this understanding within myself.

Question is: How do I properly list my job history for freelance projects? 

Do you make a Work Experience section and prioritize it by Production Companies with a bullet list for each role and a description?

...or do you prioritize the Work Experience section by the Role (Production Assistant, Assistant Editor...) and then add a bullet list of the company and job description? 

I‚Äôm not sure how to even list a job description for Production Assistant as it is pretty redundant. Even though this role isn‚Äôt editing, I‚Äôd like to keep it on my resume as it shows my industry experience.

I can only think of these two options, but is there a better way?

For me specifically, I interned, did freelance PA, and freelance DIT for a couple companies; how do I properly list all that? 

I currently prioritize by company, bullet the roles underneath, then make a separate Projects section to go into detail about certain short films I‚Äôve edited on the side. 

Hope this makes sense."

I noticed a difference in the way some responded and started understanding that I am part of the dance of interaction, but i think most of the time I still fail to demonstrate my true nature in my conversations with others. I feel like I‚Äôve come a long way as an introvert. Im a friendly and sweet person, but I see how others talk to each other instead of me. I‚Äôm often overlooked in social situations despite my efforts to be engaging. Sometimes it feels like people just don‚Äôt know how to approach me. 

I have a significant other who knows me better than anyone, but sometimes I feel that even he doesn‚Äôt get me. There‚Äôs just this spiritual connection with him that I am lacking.... and well maybe that could be a separate relationship issue.... but to be honest I feel isolated in my feelings and thoughts and don‚Äôt think even he will  truly get exactly what I feel on a deeper level.

I‚Äôd love to look deeper into my mind to understand myself more, but it‚Äôs very difficult as I‚Äôm not sure how. I struggle with anxiety and when i‚Äôm alone with myself for too long i get anxious.
