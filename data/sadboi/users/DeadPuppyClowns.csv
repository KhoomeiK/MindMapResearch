I had the tingling/numbness on and off everywhere. Everything tasted bad or like metal. Everything smelled rotten. I was already nauseous, it could have been doing it for all I know. The worst parts though was this horrible sense of I wasn't who I appeared to be.
I would look at my hands and be convinced they weren't mine. Nothing was mine. I wasn't me. I had the constant urge to run away, naked, and kill myself. 

I think there were some other little things that happened on that but those were the big things. A week or two off of it and I was back to reality. Then there was Gabapentin withdrawal. Lol"

Bridges are better than walls. You are right. But god. It's so frustrating at times. Tapping off on us, ignoring the fact a toddler comes to play below, it's just rude. While I get they have an injury they know better, their socializing is garbage but when you look them dead in the eye and ask to not throw them down and they cut you off to say ""Yeah I know"" it makes you want to ruin everything.
