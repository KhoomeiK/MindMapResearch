blogsnark,fpq9fwe,t3_gejnd3,1588817874.0,"I was alone for 20 minutes today at home and I slid across the floor in happiness. 

My partner is annoying me. Incoming rant. Quarantining has been okay but these last couple of days not at all. So many different kind of noises, all loud. Throat clearing, nose honk, spoon clattering, cough, sniff in, repeat. I‚Äôm sensitive to noises and just would like some silence for more then 15 seconds without hearing a loud bodily function. Lame jokes that aren‚Äôt funny. Getting drunk and stoned every night. Why am I the only one who suggests any sort of healthy activity? Any sort of cleanliness is out the window if I don‚Äôt tidy up right away. The drunk part especially annoys me because the lame jokes and loud noises increase. I am not attracted to that. Feels like a roommate situation more then living with a partner sometimes. 

Being in the same house for this long is just making me want to go to a cabin by myself in the middle of nowhere for a week. I‚Äôm going to try and do more things alone outside by myself. I need some space and quiet."

My first goal I‚Äôve set for myself was to get to 75 days so I‚Äôm going to try to put those thoughts away. It doesn‚Äôt help to see others enjoy a glass of wine with what looks ease. I‚Äôm sorry people are giving you shit, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve been that person in the past to someone else, i must have been projecting. It is much more difficult to not drink, to not accept the normal, to take that step back and be like maybe this isn‚Äôt what is best for me. 

It is easier in the morning when you haven‚Äôt drank though. I‚Äôm holding on to get to those 75 days, and to get those Saturday and Sunday morning moments of waking up without dread and pain and regret. Is there something for you that you can hold onto for this weekend?"
