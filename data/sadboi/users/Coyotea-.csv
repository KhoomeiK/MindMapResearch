But recently it's really been hitting me hard that that actually happened.. so I started again. But I gotta try to remember that I still made 3 months of progress.

Also, I completely understand how you feel when you said you don't care about hurting yourself. Honestly I don't care about myself at all, but I care about everyone else so much that I'm always hurting or disadvantaging myself just to make others happy.

Good luck, I just wanted to share my experience because even though it's not common for it to fail the first time, it can still happen!!

MadeOfStyrofoam,f95okfe,t3_e3kove,1575132245.0,What if you üò≥ wanted to send nudes üòéü•¥ and be intimate ü§´ but you have ruined ur body with self harm scars and now feel insecure lmao!!!! ü§°
MadeOfStyrofoam,f95my12,t1_f95llk3,1575131309.0,"I've been at it since I was 16 and now I am 19. When will it end?? Who knows!!! :)

Sadly it's the only ""coping mechanism"" I've found that works so incredibly well. When I've got a ton of built up emotion and stress I just break down cryin and do that and suddenly I feel just fine üëç

Still rate it a 0/10 would NOT recommend"
MadeOfStyrofoam,f95le5q,t1_f95k2d2,1575130319.0,"lmao bro what do you mean you're depressed?? Like just stop being sad :)

Literally I've already tried to explain to them that self-harm is an addiction and I've been doing it for years and I can't ""just stop doing it"" like they keep telling me to but they're just like üòê ok

I get that if you've never done it yourself you won't really understand how it works but maybe don't act like you know everything about it then and tell me I'm wrong??

They be like ""yeah I get depressed too but I've never cut myself before"" congratulations bro üëèüëèüëèüëè

My bad I guess for having a real tough time recently and wanting to speak to the person I know best about it I will literally never do that again & just keep it to myself next time :)))))"

Also, I've got some Hello Kitty bandaids that I've used to put on cuts before. They at least help cheer me up a little bit lmao

What dessert were you having? I hope you have a nice night btw!!"
selfharm,f91dyfm,t3_e2zwpz,1574987204.0,"Yeah, like if I see somebody else's self harm scars, to me it doesn't matter at all how severe theirs are, I'm still gonna be concerned about them and see them as worthy of help and not at all invalid. But I can't apply the same mindset to me lol?? I'm aware it makes 0 sense but like so many others, I can't shake the thought that I'm not deserving of reaching out and seeking help because mine aren't ""that deep"" ü•¥"
