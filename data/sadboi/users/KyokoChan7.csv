Cringetopia,fpay6x6,t3_gcddfn,1588458175.0,He's talking about the dictionnaire definition and he's right. You apparently can't call it racism cuz white people where never really minors. Sure it's just as horrible and stupid but u offically can't call it racism based on the definition of the term. It's not about the fact wether u should be allowed to do it or whatever juat about the theoratical definition. Maybe do some research next time ?

About Morellos I'll add that to the build then, another question tho if you don't mind. Are there any hard counters to this?

Poke wins against All-In
All-in against sustain
Sustain against poke

So I'd say Yuumi is more of a sustain champ with limited poke, so you can't play her in every match-up, she's not that strong right now anyways. So if u see the enemy pick something like Morgana or Lux, Yuumi can be a really good pick because you can just heal all the poke damage and that's fucking annoying. But if the enemy picks something like Thresh or Leona, don't take yuumi bc they will cc/immobilize your adc and you with their whole comb."

I usually get ignite and not teleport. Crit Neeko as an adc is also fine but you have less range than normal adcs and that can be fatal depending on which elo you're in and how well they play. If you go full ap look to stay safe and don't overextend, ward well and you're good. I sometimes use her passive to get through the jungle more safely because most of the people will try to burst you down but if you disguise as the fed Zed they'll most likely leave you alone.
