Maybe you could try that too? I was also reading [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/201004/the-purpose-purposelessness-part-1-4) cause for me it’s problem of apathy. Hope some of that might help or lead to. Take care."
mentalhealth,fqvcdaf,t3_gl4jcm,1589674286.0,"Hi, I want to say it’s not your fault. You’ve already reached out and tried to do what you think might help your friend. It’s not your fault that it hasn’t helped, or hasn’t yet. I’m saying this because I have ghosted people before, it was under an unhealthy escape to deal with things alone. I hope I can say this to make you feel better, the same way I wish I could say it to others I hurt before. And I hope your friend can “come back out” eventually. So whatever it may take for that to happen, please know you have already tried and even if they don’t realise it now, they will when they manage to “wake” again.
You obviously are a good friend and person. Please enjoy your graduation ceremony."
