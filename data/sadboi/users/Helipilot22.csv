I tend to think people are more glued to the physical than the mental. After the physical wears off, they're left showing their true selves of which rarely ends up long term because they were searching for the wrong character traits, or not looking at all.

When one see's within a week how blind they really are to companionship, it's eye opening. Because I had that very situation. Glued on the idea of one girl, while ignoring the other. When the other started to show love I have never seen or felt before in my life, I realized then how blind I really was and how others are still blind to it. I want nothing more than for people to feel the way I felt.

Took 27 years to come to this point, and it was hell getting there. Growing a very cynical stance to life and relationship. Now I'm working tirelessly to rewire my beliefs because they regulate my behavior when in a social atmosphere."

Nietzsche,fp5vclt,t3_ga0fme,1588340724.0,"I'll just say since COVID started to make it's way into the USA, before we really had a social impact. I went through an enlightenment that I can't put into words. I searched for the solace for 27 years. Job after job, shitty friend after shitty friend, and moving from place to place. It was a sequence of events that will stay with me till the day I die.  
I was into Philosophy by pure default when in school. I became very introspective. It did however lead to the darkest years of my life. I lacked meaning and felt useless to the world.

Sitting at a campfire, in the midst of my self described enlightenment, I began to discus it. I told the stranger I had just met that something has happened, I don't know how to explain it, but it has washed most of my immediate fears away. He told me, he could see it in my eyes.

Later that night as I was with a girl that's a friend of mine. I've become extremely open about my life and all the facets it entails. Including that of relationships of which I have little experience with. I had admitted to her I had never kissed a girl before. Before we parted I asked if I could kiss her. It was that moment I finally felt human. A kind of kiss most hormonal teenagers dream about. I'd say that was a moment when no longer felt indifferent from the rest.

I've had my interests and passions through my life, but now I see them as scapegoats for my inability to face my fears. But not to say they didn't bring me joy. Aviation is my interest, and I still love it to death. But I'm now less obsessive over it or anything else, even woman.

I've been trying to put these experiences into words, I just am unable to convert my experience into words as I'd like. My new found passion and joy is other people. Not for the friendships, or the sense of community, of which I had longed for. But for the lessons to learn from other people. For no man is your enemy, no man is your friend, but every man is your teacher.

Learning is my passion, and writing is my way of expression.

I have Aspergers and have discussed my changes with people of the same diagnosis. Some express jealousy, of which I tell them not to. Because life took me through hell to get to this point, and I have many more years of pain and pleasure ahead. Learn from it, as I say. The pain you feel today prepares you for the pain tomorrow."

Existentialism,fp5rpmn,t3_gbdhf9,1588338342.0,"Only meaning I can justify is purely based on what we are, animals. We are here for one purpose, survival. That means to procreate. It's only thanks to consciousness that we look beyond the obvious for different ways to bring meaning to ones life.

That being said, doesn't mean that we can't define our own meaning. Just look at philosophers. Many of them struggle through life and search for a silver lining within it. Each conscious person is to each their own. No two people think or operate the same.

I admire the idea of the Ubermensch, and the idea of eternal recurrence. For they make you question every thread of your being. That's why I'm glad I found philosophy, to take the ideas of one to formulate your own meaning.

No man is your friend, no man is your enemy, every man is your teacher."

I had spend days thinking I was better than relationships. Only to lead to a great feeling of emptiness.   


I moved back to the country and I'm finally getting a sense of community. Some of the things that have happened in my life just recently I couldn't make up. All I did was be myself and slowly had the wool pulled from over my eyes. Helped so much that I no longer have anxiety about woman. You just gotta meet some and be friends with them. It becomes pretty obvious if they're interested. Best thing I can say is, do not change who you really are. If people don't like it that's their problem. As a show of self-confidence, tell them off.
