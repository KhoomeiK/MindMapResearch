Having your psyche shattered on a daily basis as a child really wreaks havoc on you as an adult. I have a shattered sense of personality, low self esteem, a severe inferiority complex that has lead me to blow dozens of opportunities that have been presented to me. It sucks, a lot. CPTSD isn’t talked about as much. Years of constant “little traumas” add up, especially as a child when you absorb everything like a sponge.

I’m trying to be as objective as possible, but why should we deny ourselves from enjoying pleasure to its fullest. Be that monogamous, polyamorous, or somewhere in between. Perhaps you stumble upon something better. I’m not saying that the point is to endlessly seek for “something better”. But, again objectively speaking, we all have dozens of “perfect matches” it’s just a matter of which one(s) you happen to stumble upon in your lifetime. 

People can have sex without being in an amorous relationship, so why is it that when we enter an amorous one we force ourselves to stop doing the latter. We do it because we’re used to how things just are. Or personal boundaries.

I, though monogamous, believe we are not meant to be sexually monogamous. Evolutionarily speaking, we’re meant to fuck till we can’t no more lol we aren’t cavemen anymore, we have more nuanced needs if I can call them, we need emotional connection and understanding that can very well be met by one or some. 

Sex does not inherently equate to love. Some might want to only share their sex with love, but the latter still doesn’t make the first statement untrue.

Point being said, people should do whatever they want sexually as long as it’s consensual."

I now work healthcare, and there’s something about being provided a service that makes a customer or patient into a fucking piece of shit. Caffeine addiction is real, and if you’re already a jerk, you excuse yourself. The nastiest interactions I’ve had have been with customers behind the bar. I can write a book, I swear.

I dedicated work to making latte art, but aside from the art, there is a dance to handling a bar. Any bar for that matter, be it coffee or alcohol. It’s not for everyone, it’s a fast dance. You have to time the shots, steam the milk at a certain angle depending on how much froth you want, pour at a certain degree depending on how much milk to foam ratio you want. It’s a lot of playing with degrees and angles that comes with the wrist. It definitely is a craft."

bipolar,fkvo9lp,t3_fkrp85,1584573279.0,"I work at an ER and our hospital has a psych unit. It hurts when I hear them talking in absolutes like saying all bipolar people are “crazy”. Little do they know I suffer from the same illness as some of their patients.

To be fair though, we see mostly extreme cases. Some people are, as harsh as it sounds, just too far gone. We have regulars that probably spend most of their days here than there. They deal with feces being throw, biting, punching.

We’ve had a tech being sent to the ER after a massive beating from a objectively LARGE woman.

It’s tough. Nothings black and white. I wish they just knew that there’s others among them with mental illnesses as well. “Normal” people sometimes have more than just depression or anxiety."
