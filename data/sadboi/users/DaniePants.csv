Advise? Sit down and sit NEXT to her. Not across a table or anything, but like a physical statement that you are on her side, bring up that you read her dream journal, and you know what happened. Tell her RIGHT UP FRONT that you are a million percent for her and will stand by her during whatever consequences happen. Prepare for any kind of response. She may melt down, she may freeze and dissociate, she may get closed down and get angry, be prepared to not be prepared. Get a therapist appointment lined up for you two before you talk and float the idea of seeing someone. If she‚Äôs agreeable, then you can tell her. If not, reschedule the appointment. 

Let her lead the pace of discussion. Prepare for many talks down the road. This is complex issue and could harm you both and your relationship. She likely will have PTSD symptoms, so it may help to read up on that if you have questions. 

Lastly, I‚Äôm really glad she has you. Together, you guys can get through this. I‚Äôm really sorry. You both need some serious therapy from someone really good. Don‚Äôt settle, keep looking for help until you find a good one. I can give you tips on how to screen out the crazies when you are choosing a therapist. I hope healing for everyone involved. üíù"
