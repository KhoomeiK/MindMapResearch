TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqrekrl,t3_gemzgu,1589582819.0,"Was trying to find this post again. Some women who wanted change after I thought I was getting a $2 tip on a crazy snowy day. I was working all weekend and I can’t remember which day it was. But the first day it snowed a lot during shift, and the 2nd day it was negative degrees cold so all the snow froze and it was an all around awful weekend. I was covering for a coworker who had to go to the emergency room. Some lady ordered, it was super busy so I was on a 5 order delivery. I was making good time. But this lady refuses to tip and wants her small amount of change back. Then at the door, a gust of wind hits and her door flies open. She yells to me “watch my door” and I had had enough at the point, I responded “you want me to watch your door for no tip?” And with that I went back to my car and drove away.  The way she whined “watch my door” it sounded like she was trying to blame me and not the wind. 

Anyways I delivered to her yesterday. Sure enough she didn’t tip this time either.  It was a credit card order so I just went into grey duck mode, and left my cheery customer service norm in my car, I don’t think I said a word to her.  She was trying to be polite but I knew as soon as she thanked me that I again wasn’t getting a tip so I walked away in silence.

While delivering to this woman who never tips, I notice she was wearing scrubs. I think it’s safe to assume that she’s some kind of nurse and that certainly explains her lack of tipping. My coworker will mess with food when he knows people don’t tip to try to get them to stop ordering. He shakes the pizza often or drops stuff on purpose. It’s all in packaging so nothing is getting dirty. Usually shaking the pizza messes it up enough that the people stop calling."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqrbqag,t3_gja2xt,1589581283.0,"$5 is always a good tip. You can give more of you want. Before I became a delivery driver I would tip well. And now I usually tip more. Every time I order it’s a $5-10 tip. There’s a local Chinese restaurant that I enjoy a lot.  Whenever I ate there I’d tip big. When I learned that idiots were boycotting Chinese restaurants because of the virus, apparently it’s the fault of the small Chinese restaurant owned by Filipino-Americans (flawed logic). Anyways I started ordering more Chinese. I gave the driver who is also the owner $20. He’s always been a super nice guy whenever I ate there."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqrapsq,t3_gbneir,1589580749.0,"I had someone with no money try to get their pizza from me. She ordered first a cash order but then said she didn’t have any cash, so she changed it to credit, but the credit card was declined. She then switched back to cash, but since she already said she didn’t have any cash, I was sent with caution. I get there and usually with apartments I call and they come down to get the food. I had to walk up 3 floors, there was no apartment number on the ticket so I didn’t know how far I’d be walking. I get there and she opens the door with a small child next to her, I assume to try and guilt me. I tell her the amount and she tells me that she payed with a credit card. I tell her that the card got declined. She said she doesn’t have any cash and explain that I can’t give her the food. Then I left. I felt bad but she definitely tried to scam me. She knew full and well her card got declined."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqr9hq5,t3_gbrnm9,1589580102.0,"That sucks. There was a deaf guy who used to deliver to our house. It was pretty much the same as any other delivery, minus the small talk.

It was for punishment of the people that wouldn’t tip and wanted change. My plan was to make them stand in the cold long while I looked through the bag to give them change without using quarters. The plan was to give them the change in coins first before giving cash, in hopes that they’d get cold and tell me to keep the change. Sadly most of my stiffs after that were from a credit card order. The most recent time someone wanted change, it wasn’t cold enough for my coat."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqr7unz,t3_gc9j52,1589579224.0,"I had that happen to me when a child answered the door. She was a teenager and the bill was $23 something she gave me $25 and after I handed the pizza I started to walk away. She then said “uh, my change” and I responded “how much would you like back” she replied “$2” and before I could tell her that’s not how math works her mom came out to see what was going on. When she explained she was asking for change, her mom told me to keep it. I assume the mom explained the importance of tipping delivery drivers."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqr6sej,t3_gcqdn9,1589578659.0,"That sounds so difficult. There’s a guy who orders from our shop often and constantly tries to get a discount. He tips maybe 25% of the time and he often calls right before we stop delivering. So that usually means when I should be going home, I’m stuck waiting for his pizza to be ready then taking it on the way home."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqq92fx,t1_fpnekde,1589561476.0,"I get payed $40 a day from the shop to deliver pizza. Tips are what really make me money. When I work weekdays, my hours are 4pm to 10pm, 6 hours so $5 an hour. Weekends it’s 4pm to 11pm so 7 hours yet still just $40 for the day, which is less that $5 an hour. Minimum wage is $8.25 per hour in my state. From what I’ve learned about other countries where tipping isn’t the norm, it’s because you get payed a much better hourly rate. 

There’s a guy in our delivery range that tips $200 each time he orders. Sadly he’s only ordered twice since I’ve started working, and both times were on a day I wasn’t working. My coworker says he used to order a lot more, but said his health issues prevent him from eating pizza as much as he used to."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqq7dld,t3_geffbf,1589560658.0,"Last week I got 2 $20 tips in one day. One was from my dad and my birthday being 2 days away, I assume that was his reasoning. Also my shop gives my family a discount anytime they order, so I usually get $10 tip from my dad or sister. The other $20 was from a complete stranger and someone I’ve never delivered to before. He seemed to have had his hands full. He was trying to wrangle children a cute dog and put the large pizza I handed him down at the same time. I thanked him profusely for the generous tip. Then his dog decided to jump up on me and sniff my face. The owner seemed horrified but as a dog lover I welcomed it, and helped the owner get the dog back in the house (he lives on a busy street so I assumed he didn’t want the dog to run off)."

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fqn9cjg,t3_gj9bdi,1589490874.0,"I often have to deliver outside of our range because my coworkers who take the orders don’t live around here. Last week that happened. It was the end of my shift so when that happens, they usually have me cash out and pay for the remaining pizza so when I deliver I keep the money and go home. This delivery was to an apartment and they told me to call ahead. I did just that and they still weren’t ready when I got there. Made me wait 10 min while they finally came down. The pizza was a 24 inch pizza so the bill was $37.45. He gave me $40 and I handed him the pizza and started to walk away. He spoke up saying that of it was his money he’d tip me, and said he needed change. I gave him back $2. Then I raced home cause I had another delivery by my house. I should have taken that one first, it was a credit card order and the tip was already on there. Initially I thought the one far away wasn’t that far. It was late and my brain was mush by then.

Haven’t had anyone accuse me of stealing yet. I’ve had only one complaint. A nurse who wouldn’t tip called to tell them I was yelling at her. My boss told her what she wanted to hear. Then told me she must have been making stuff up cause he knows I wouldn’t yell at a customer. It takes a lot to get me worked up into yelling. Last time I yelled at someone in public I felt awful after so I likely won’t yell. But I explained that the customer was 3 floors above me, and I never saw her face to yell at her. And the people I delft with on the first floor were nice to me so I wouldn’t yell at them. We don’t deliver to that nursing home anymore cause another nurse there complained too and started yelling at my boss. None of the nurses there ever tipped."

But it seems everyone wants me to take 1 at a time or only theirs. Usually I hand the pizza and they hand me the money, or they hand me the money I put it in my pocket and hand them the pizza then give them their change. But this lady wanted me to take her money and give her change while holding on the the pizza. Every pizza is in a paper cover, then put into the cardboard box to keep it warm.

TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fq9utc6,t3_gemzgu,1589207481.0,"There’s an assisted living home for elderly people nearby that started ordering from our shop once the quarantine stay at home orders started. My assumption on why they started ordering then was cause no other pizza shop would deliver to a place where the most vulnerable live. It was only the nurses ordering food from there and not the residents. I went there and I handed the pizza off, the lady who ordered it I guess didn’t want to come down for it, so some other nurse took it up. It was a 24 inch pizza, and a liter of soda, maybe 2. It’s a pain when they the soda too, I said to the guy who took the pizza “no tip?” He claimed it wasn’t for him so it wasn’t his money. Then the receptionist took it upon herself to call the nurse to ask if she was going to tip me. The nurse claimed she didn’t have any cash on her. So I left. Around 10pm that night, I returned to the shop to cash out and my boss had just gotten off the phone with the nurse. She claimed I had yelled at her for not tipping. I didn’t even see her to yell at her, she was 3 floors above me. My boss told her what she wanted to hear. Then told me he knew she was lying, cause he knew I wouldn’t yell at a customer. I explained what happened, and I said I didn’t yell, I probably shouldn’t have said something but it was a long day. That nursing home kept calling, the next time they called they asked for me to deliver, I think they wanted to get revenge or something, but I wasn’t working that day. Luckily I didn’t get any other deliveries to them. My coworker had to keep delivering to people who never tipped. Eventually they complained about my coworker, cause he wouldn’t go inside the nursing home whenever they wanted the pizza, so the called my boss to complain and he lost his patience with them, telling them never to call again. As far as I know, they haven’t. I looked up reviews of this place and they were terrible. Apparently the nurses verbally abuse the residents here and possibly physical abuse them too. 

From what I’ve learned on here, it seems like most nurses don’t tip. I’m not really sure why."

But he also played in a system in which you had to shoot the ball very early in the shot clock. While Stockton played in an era where you used most of the shot clock. Stockton had good but old players around him. Nash had good enough players to make the playoffs every time in his prime. Stockton was in the top 10 of all time PGs in both Offense and Defense where as Nash is only there on the offense side. So you can see why people may favor Stockton to Nash.

So I’ve been helping her by picking her up, then she gives me dirty looks. She’s pretty funny.  She still enjoys going under my legs when I’m sitting, that’s her way of cuddling."
OldManDog,fo0yx1i,t3_g3zlnr,1587422421.0,"I miss my old pup Fudge, lost him over 10 years ago. It gets better, but you won’t stop missing him. Sounds like you grew up with Zach, I had that same connection with Fudge. When relatives were moving to another country and couldn’t take their dog with, it had been a few months after we lost Fudge, we decided to adopt Cookie. She was a weird little dog, completely different than a lab. But it was nice having a dog to spend time with again. Cookie quickly became part of the family, but I still miss Fudge.  Time will make it a better, but it’s good to keep the memories of a great dog."
OldManDog,fo0xzcw,t3_g4pace,1587421898.0,"I had a lab and I’ve dog sat a Great Dane a few times. Sounds like a great mix of a very snuggly pup.  Sadly my tiny dog, a mutt, doesn’t like to cuddle. We’ve had her over 10 years, and she really only cuddles if she wants it, which is rare."
aww,fo0xf1c,t3_g4udrm,1587421586.0,Happy birthday big pup
SelfAwarewolves,fo0wk4g,t1_fnyzwcw,1587421115.0,"This kinda reminds me of high school. You go to class and you have a substitute. So half the class thinks they can fuck around cause it’s a substitute, the substitute doesn’t know their names so surely he can’t punish them.  But the other half of the class realizes that the substitute is a football coach, and that you shouldn’t fuck around. Well the dumb half just keeps fucking around until the substitute gives everyone a lunch detention cause the one half wouldn’t shut the fuck up. I think I’m still bitter about that, that substitute’s wife recently ran for something and I didn’t vote for her cause her husband gave me lunch detention 17 years ago. 

Anyways these idiot protesters are gonna ruin it for the rest of us by extending the quarantine."

Also pizza gate must have had someone to do with Splinter and The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. (Just out crazy the crazy and they will get confused). 

But in all seriousness, how come nothing is ever Trumps fault with them? Suddenly he can do no wrong while every press briefing he does, he says something worse than the day before."
Fibromyalgia,fnytg70,t1_fnyt46s,1587375010.0,"Well my doctor sucks and hates prescribing anything for me. When I was on antidepressants he would unexpectedly stop giving me refills and I’d go through withdrawals. Plus i don’t really wanna go to a doctor’s office right now.  I asked him why suddenly NyQuil wouldn’t work for me, took it last year when I had a really bad cold and it kept me up. He suggested I stop taking it. I really wanted to say, “no shit, Sherlock” but held my tongue. This is not the first time he’s given me overwhelmingly obvious advice that only an idiot would not follow. Hard not to follow something I was already doing."

facepalm,fnysz5m,t3_g4njr5,1587374506.0,"I plan to buy extra toilet paper once everything opens up again. Not gonna but tons every time. But probably get an extra few each trip. I don’t plan on making a profit. It seems like if things get back to normal in the summer, it’s likely that once it gets cold again the virus will be back and worse. And it would be nice to have extra to donate to friends who struggled finding some before. A close friend and his kids got the virus early on. They promptly stayed inside since,  would have been nice to chunk some tp in their backyard since he could go out and get some.  But I didn’t have any extra. I was conserving by showering after every BM."

Maybe I’m being a little too suspicious."
facepalm,fnysbql,t3_g4bs2z,1587373812.0,"I generally don’t like to travel. I’ve been on a few road trips in my life and they were ok. I’ve been on a plane twice and it was fine. It just seems like an overall hassle to travel somewhere. I can sit in my car driving around my neighborhood for hours, which I usually do when delivering pizza or playing Pokémon Go. I just don’t like being too far away from my house. Most recent road trip I’ve been on, was to a wedding 7 hours away. Stayed for 2 nights before returning. It was nice and I didn’t have to drive at all. But for some reason I’ve never had motivation to really go far. I don’t exactly have the money to travel right now, but even if I did, I doubt I’d want to spend money on something like that."

It was all there but they said they couldn’t accept it.  It was so annoying cause when I was at the bank, the rule was as long as they had more than 50% of the bill. It was so annoying."
