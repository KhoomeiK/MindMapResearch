BPD,fkdkq26,t3_fc2mfh,1584082650.0,Thanks so much for posting this.  I almost got a neck injury when I threw my head back and belted out some deep belly laughs! Oh Lordy.  I needed that.
Fibromyalgia,fkdjlbc,t3_f5eqkd,1584081296.0,"Gosh, I'm in the same boat with everyone here on the thread.  No motivation (to go along with all of my other fibro symptoms).  I've read that you don't need motivation, you just need to ""show up"" and then you'll do what you need to do.  For instance, if you're needing to go for a walk, ""showing up"" would be putting your tennis shoes on.  Or, if you need to eat better, ""showing up"" would be preparing yourself a salad.  Let me know if it works for you.  But for me, I need a ""PRE-showing up showing up""! LOL Or a little motivation to show up. I won't even do yoga at home. I need to go for a walk and I'll sit down to put my shoes on, exhausted from getting dressed, and I'll stay in the recliner the rest of the day. UGH."
