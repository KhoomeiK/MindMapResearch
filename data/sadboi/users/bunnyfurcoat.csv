I think you need to go to a support group. If you‚Äôre in the Seattle area, PM me for an amazing bipolar group in the area. A support group will help with feelings of isolation and will help you stay accountable about your episodes to others who understand your illness. It can help with feelings of connection and combat the isolation feeling. We are in this illness for life but we‚Äôre not in it alone. Besides a support group, I think you need to talk to your doctor. Med change, IOP (intensive outpatient), or PHP (partial hospital) might all be on the way for you to help you get back to a safe place.
