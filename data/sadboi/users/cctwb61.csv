Why do I feel like this? I personally think it’s because I use to live two lives. One that everyone knew of and the other was from within and things I would do that I do t want those closet to me to know. So those things were in my subconscious and it caused guilt and or shame. Worried  deep that I would be found out. Well, I’ve felt with those things on a different level, realized that everyone had it, and became more transparent.

The shot could cause more problems so not worth the try to me. I also went to a Chinese medical doc and she suggested using.... a type of oil and then high speed vibrations to help break up the plaque. I did not follow thru. Instead I use a vacuum point each night (like over the last month or so) and it has helped quite a bit. My only real issue is it shorten me about an inch and I didn’t have that to spare. But I do, and my girl, like the bend. For me, it almost feels like the top ligament is shorter then my penis, causing it to draw towards me beginning just under the head.

Just when I was ready to go under she would begin light snoring. It would get louder as time went on. I could hear her fall off the deep end in her sleep, soooo relaxed, because then it would sound like me when I was drunk! I would just move to the other bedroom, no big deal. It’s not her fault. She can hear herself while sleeping and make herself stop. It was my problem to deal with. So off I would go. Next morning she would ask why I left the bed. At first I would tell her because of her snoring. She would get mad and I would tell her not too. It got to a point that I said stop asking me why when I wake up in another room. But she couldn’t. So I would just say I couldn’t sleep. She tried everything to try to stop, all the products on the shelf. She would feel so bad. But I didn’t care. I told her I don’t care and it’s MY problem not hers. Just like it’s his problem. He is being unreasonable and it may be showing his upcoming personality. It your not being totally noisy, like jumping into bed when he’s almost asleep, turning in lights, being loud with doors and such when he’s trying to sleep. There is a level of due respect of quietness when someone is trying to go to sleep, but to stop breathing, not yawn, or roll over is ridiculous.  Bad move in his part having you sleep on couch when you were sick also! He’s not treating you with respect and my guess is he will learn or become single.

It’s baffling- it tell your when your drinking that you can keep going, drink one more, you feel good now why did you think you’ll feel bad tomorrow”?? And then tomorrow comes and you feel like shit! But it talks you into just one to feel better. And it’s powerful!! It so powerful that it controls what you do, when you do it, and where you do it. It wants to make sure that your always at a place you can get more and more all in order to make you feel like shit! It becomes the most important thing in your every day. Even when it takes everything away from you it still wants more!!! 

You seem clear enough right now to make a decision. Make a decision for just one day. Today I’m not going to drink. I will drink tomorrow, but today I am not. Let tomorrow be tomorrow! Just stay in the now and right now I’m not going to drink! Sometimes we have to do that in smaller chunks, like I’m not drinking for the next hour! Or minute for some.  Do this each day and every time you want to drink. Keep putting it off until later. Later never becomes now, because only now can be now!

Then go find a AA meeting. Everyone at an AA meeting is just like you! Your not alone! Do what those people do and you won’t drink. I’m going to a meeting right now. 

You will quit when your ready, when you’ve had enough, enough of dying. That’s what we do when we drink. We kill ourselves a little more with each drink. That’s one reason it feels so dam bad! We’re giving our life away to a thing called alcohol! You’ve planted your own seed. I pray you listen to yourself before you can say something to yourself. That happens to a lot of us.

I got sober and what do you know? I don’t feel depressed (difference between not happy and depressed). Been taking Effexor for almost 3 years and been sober. Coupled with the side affects (and some are unusual for but do happen to men), I want off. Which takes me to now. I began reading blogs on different meds that I’ve been prescribed about a year ago. Granted, they may work but every single one comes with other affects. My belief is turning to mindfullness and natural remedies for cures of tough life situations instead of the big pharmaceutical. If you really dig into it their scope of control on medical treatment will scare you. Please don’t let a doctor sell you on a single much less multiple drugs that work on brain chemistry!

She is blessed to have you for support when she dose make that choice. Has she, or you, read the Big Book of AA? The “Doctors Opinion” and “Bill’s Story” can be the start of a sober life. So many people, including the alcoholic believe it’s their fault and a matter of will power. They will be the first to say they don’t have the will power to remain sober. That’s because it’s not about will power. Alcoholism is a disease, one of the body, mind, and spirit. AA addresses all of those using 12 steps.

Continue and branch out looking at my finances, Bill companies, budgets, and my chores.  Is something going on around me that I might be loosing my joy towards??? 

I’m self, I would check on my thoughts and pay close attention to what I’m thinking about during those times you mention. Am I thinking in the past or future? Both will cause issues. Try to be in the moment (feel your breathing) because that’s all we have anyway. Lot of literature on Mindfullness. 

Use that close person to answer questions for you and someone that you can have a therapy session with. Have them tell you if your acting different. 

I guess you can tell that I dislike this drug! Lol. Been on it for three years and I am also tapering and am at 37.5.  The only emotional side I’m having is that I’m kinda empathetic where I wasn’t at all before tapering. Physically I’m experiencing sleep issues and few zaps."

If she is safe from him, and has not shown any signs of abuse, do not tell her. But you can use this threat against him if he will not meet with a professional ASAP! If she dose show signs of abuse then take your guidance and assistance from the therapist. 

This is extremely complicated; for her mental health. She is at such an age that she could go in so many displaced directions. Especially telling her this and he has never touched her. 

If she had not been abused, think of her mental health and affects it will cause her. Only professional help can help you navigate those waters.

In sex, when not totally erect we can injure it in penetration. It happen to me a couple years ago. She was coming down from the top pretty hard and I kind of slip out but not all the way, then she came down hard and it bent my penis pretty good. I was probably about 75% erect (not a good erection). I felt a little pain but thought nothing of it. About two-three month later I started seeing a curve when erect that was different. Maybe six month later there was a different feeling when erect not really painful, it was that feeling when I was young and got erect. It would get so hard but it was a good pain. Anyway, it started feeling like that, with a bend. I went to doctor and glue said it was Pyronies Disease. It’s not really a disease but they cause it that because a lot of men get it and they really can’t fix it. For me, just below the gland and just below the ring (don’t know what it’s called) I have a upward and bend to the left. At that point, I can bend my penis pretty far left but not to the right when erect.  

They have very little treatment but doc says if you report it as early as 1-3 months they might be able to stop any progression. After that it’s just a waiting game. So for me, after almost two years I started using a penis pump almost daily. It has helped a lot but it’s not totally repaired. My biggest complaint from me, is it’s now banana shaped and I lost about an inch in length. I know it’s an inch because I can bend it straight and it’s an inch longer. The good side of it is that it really connects with her g spot naturally and her orgasms are pretty incredible and long."
Effexor,fa9eurt,t3_e7zt63,1575871033.0,"How old are you? Never diagnosed for all that before, how long did this doctor take in order to come up with this current diagnosis? I hope you have been seeing them for a year or more. If not I would go see another for a second opinion. You have experience tapering from Effexor and see the difficulties. Can you imagine getting off all those other drugs? I’ve been tapering on my own and with the help of a doctor. I was only taking 75mg Effexor and I was pretty much done when I went back on (this time with a doctor). My withdrawal were the zaps and increased anxiety but not too bad. Worst was I could not sleep. So I went back on 75mg for a week to 10 days then began 37.5.  Still have sleep issues and Munro zaps but for the way it’s going, I think I’ll be done by Christmas."

relationships,fa3fpk6,t3_e7g9ea,1575793607.0,"Are you sure husband didn’t just say that to check your reaction? I’m a guy and I have done that and what I found out was not good. Now for your issue; talk to husband again. Ask exactly what did she say. Ask him how it came up in the first place and what she said to him but with that attitude like.. did she tell you what I got you for a Christmas kind of questioning. When your satisfied that he is telling you the truth and not yanking your chain, go see your GF. Sit eye to eye and explain to her that your trust her and you need to know if she said that. Tell her you need to trust her because she is the only one you have to vent to. If she says she did, let it go, just say please don’t do it in the future. Make her believe that you will talk about stuff in the future and it’s okay.... you might need to rehearse this. Then let a little time pass and begin chatting to her again. Now you can go two ways with this. Something dramatic or maybe joke to watch if it gets back to him. Then you’ll know the truth and who you can or can not trust. 

Or, use the hell out of it to your benefit. Talk to her about how worried you are with his lack of financial planning and if he doesn’t turn his shit around your gonna have to find someone else!"

BreakUps,fa160ae,t1_f9tvi1w,1575765052.0,"I can get what she is saying. I have the same difficulty managing or balancing work, relationship, family, and social. Even without a relationship my social side is affected.  I feel like I have to be different for work the I am when I’m with my girl. Coming home from work is stressing because I have to take my work hat off and become boyfriend / provider. That’s a deeper interpretation than I’ve ever thought of and it not very deep, lol. Maybe it’s because I don’t know who I am when I have to shift between roles, I don’t know. It’s deff not because I have too much going on. Regardless,  my “inner person” is stressed in a relationship, it’s deff not anything the other person is doing. It’s not like this in the beginning either. It takes a few months maybe six months for it to come on. I was married for 23 years and she and I dated for 7 years before that. We only lasted that long because we didn’t live together for most of it. I was in the military and had to have different stations. I traveled so much when stationed at these places she didn’t want to come. She wanted more stability. We spent a lot of time together even while living apart. Anyway, when I retired and came home and it didn’t take long for me to feel stressed and smothered, even though she was not like that. After divorce I’ve dated and two got serious. One engaged. And bam, those same feelings are back. Maybe it’s selfishness with my time, again I don’t know. But now, I want to find out."
malefashionadvice,f9zgbde,t1_f9uoabk,1575741584.0,"It’s Dr Wahl or Whal..... my Chinese  medical doctor first told me about her. Please do look her up. If she’s not fake, it’s pretty miraculous how at least some of her symptoms reversed. My cousins was about 40 when he found out. He wrecked his motorcycle and from that exam I think is when he was told. He has two PhD, masters and so on he was a professor at One of the universities in Virginia and was a lead engineer for Exonn. Very successful and remarkable life. Up until, I think, 2017 he still traveled (with help) to speak at universities. 

When people ask you how your doing, tell them! I told Chris that the other night and he finally vented. I listened for maybe 10 min as he expressed his anger towards this disease and then he finally said, “well enough of my whining.....” lol. It did three things; he was able to vent!! And I was able to better understand what was going on and just how terrible this is, and I was thankful. God bless you and please learn to accept from anyone offering- it may very well be the hand of God offering."

malefashionadvice,f9u6gkx,t1_f9u3vne,1575645245.0,"Sorry to hear that. My cousin has MS and it’s really progressing. He won’t move in with me and is living in his own with assisted living coming to his home. He’s confined to a bed. He broke his femur last year trying to get out of bed in his own. Yet, he refuses to leave the town where his 15 year old son lives. Ex dose nothing to help him. I wish he would come live with me for time he has left. God bless you. There a female MD, I can’t think of her name, who has MS. After a couple of years trying everything and declining. She couldn’t walk. She divided to figure this out for herself and created a diet to heal. She studied every faucet of the disease. Nine months after she began self care she was riding her bike with the family! She tours, speaks, and has a book. If you haven’t heard of her look for her."

alcoholism,f9tcoio,t1_f9sosnp,1575617531.0,"Sounds like a real alcoholic. I wouldn’t stop till it was gone or passed out. And kind of anxious if I don’t have something already for net day. This means you should probably just stay sober or hook up with 12 step program. Be in your guard because that desire will return. Just know it’s starts in the mind. Then once you take the first drink it turns to craving. And the madness begins again. The best of luck to you, although it’s not luck really."

And I haven’t seen any post talking about their own professional certifications on how to deal with this. I find it very hard to believe that OP therapist gave such vague guidance and believe that person should have be playing 14 year old at the heart of this. I would seek outside assistance for the whole family situation for the very next meeting of all. Meaning OP doesn’t  just show up and brother and SIl house without help. Maybe get the family that raised him and OP to a Professional, discuss this and how you should go about it before  bringing in the 14 year old into a possible shit storm."
