Like literal flow state levels of skill that all goes into talking to people. And it's never sustainable and super context sensitive like you're saying. I definitely feel like a computer with all it's RAM dedicated to shit most people don't even need to think about. I've created some good habits but it's so low level compared to everyone else I talk to. Like they're on this clearly visible wavelength that sure I can participate in sometimes but a lot of the time end up embarrassing myself and regretting even trying in the first place.

Not to mention the dumbest shit people expect you to find ""relatable"". Normal people seem more cringe than ASD people sometimes."

Anxiety,fmz1pwt,t3_fxyye3,1586503101.0,"Group conversations feel like a pissing contest of who can talk the most, be the funniest, and control the room the best. It feels like less of a conversation and more like putting on a show. It's also generally harder to talk about more meaningful things in more depth with everyone competing for time to share their thoughts. I also find that a medium or large size group will constantly shift from one big conversation into a couple smaller conversations back and forth over and over.

It's annoying when one person keeps talking and talking without ever letting other people talk.

It's annoying to be forced to cut someone off if you really want to say something you thought of.

It's annoying when someone asks you a question about something you're actually interested in talking about and when you start going on about said thing they hit you with one word responses or immediately turn to someone else in the group after you've said your piece or change the subject.

Like why the fuck ask if you obviously don't care and are only doing it to try and get me to talk? I see what you're doing but thanks no thanks.

As an introvert it's absolutely exhausting to stay on top of. I'm either bored, anxious, or a mixture of both.

I've found that between 1-4 people is the sweet spot for me. When it starts getting to like 6+ shit starts getting really annoying really fast.

In my experience, 1 on 1 is good for therapy session-type conversation, which is cool but not something I want all the time. Although it IS still possible to be silly and banter."
SIBO,fmhfcpk,t3_fuhdzh,1586077815.0,"How do people feel about parasites potentially causing this? A few years ago around summer 2017 a buddy and I went out for sushi one time and both started having general digestive issues at the same exact time. My gut health randomly went to shit and hasn't gotten better since. Was given a colonoscopy and they found a few ulcers but didn't seem too concerned and shrugged their shoulders at it. All blood work and stool swabs and crohns/ulcerative colitis tests they did were all normal yet I still feel like shit after all these years. If the gallbladder is involved maybe the cause of the liver problems could be liver flukes. Western medicine act like parasites are this uncommon 3rd world thing but many are endemic to a bunch of developed countries including the US. It was shocking to see how little ""specialists"" seem to understand the GI system and how much they shrug off symptoms if they don't line up with what they got taught in school. Co-pay is $100 so I can't afford to keep making appointments just to get random ass tests that always come up normal any way. It's like the fuckers are playing darts blindfolded cuz they lack the proper knowledge to actually problem solve outside their comfort zone. Or maybe that's how they make their money. I'm tired of feeling like dogshit 24/7.

(Also, a lot of the drugs used to treat the types of parasites that are ENDEMIC TO THE US are only available through the CDC, which makes NO FUCKING SENSE. Some of those drugs cost literal pennies, and to not have readily available treatment to something you could pick up in your own country, even as a strictly proactive measure, that's also cheap, and relatively safe, and that can cause such subtle symptoms, sometimes none at all, is just the definition of insanity.)"

I haven't seen my ""best friend"" in 3 years, and the only other friend I had made it clear around the same time that I cared a lot more about him than he did me, even though we hung out with each other constantly for years throughout childhood. I asked him directly and he told me that. Guess I didn't read the social queues correctly. Or he was just kind of a manipulative dick. Or both. Doesn't matter now.

My two old ""friends"" still see each other all the time and not once have either of them tried contacting me in the past **3 years**. Not a single text or call. Even before that I was always left out when they hung out anyway. They were embarrassed by me, and I don't blame them. So I feel your pain there.

I wouldn't wanna subject anyone to me either.

honestly just play around with your voice and try and make fun of yourself and exaggerate the parts of your voice you dont like. once you learn how to exaggerate it, you can pull it back and maybe improve it. sound like a girl? then summon the energy of the girliest girl you can possibly muster and try and sound like her. treat it like an improv exercise/learning how to manipulate your voice. make some abominable noises."
LowSelfEsteem,fiwkbq5,t3_f9uc3h,1582789527.0,"same brother. my voice is super high and nasally and doesnt match my appearance at all. on most days my voice is quiet even when i try and push it and all days it doesnt have any resonance no matter how much i experiment with placement, projection, etc. i wanted to be a singer but i realize its impossible with a shitty voice. you can be the the best singer in the world but have a godawful voice that completely negates it. good voice > good singer. not to mention how differently you might be perceived because of how you sound in everyday speech. its a depressing rabbit hole if you let your brain head down it.

nothing we can do about it aside from training your vocal muscles and speaking/singing using proper technique with the voices we were cursed with and do the best we can. some people with naturally good voices just got lucky and fell into good habits/born with good genetics. still not quite done mourning the futile reality of genetic lotteries and i dont think ill ever stop being bitter about it. think of it as just another hill to climb. own your voice the best you can, even if it sucks and you hate it with every ounce of your being (like i do LOL)."

Anxiety,eys2jyh,t3_cyehwd,1567385235.0,"it sounds like youve been dealing with the same issue as me. you ever suddenly get a weird kind of dizzy feeling as if theres this pressure in your head spontaneously releasing and you realize ""oh shit all the tension is leaving all at once and i have no clue why. wtf"" ?

i used to get almost daily headaches because of it, but recently have reduced in frequency after coming across and researching [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_myositis_syndrome#Controversy) from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV4IU85s5ao) about this smash player suffering from hand pain for years and suddenly curing it out of nowhere, which sounds like a crock of shit, but after realizing his story sounded exactly like mine, instead with migraines/ muscle tension, i looked into it more. i recommend watching the video and looking at that wiki to see if it connects any dots for you. the smasher also talks about a book he read about the subject, so that might be worth reading as well. this isnt a quick fix, just a potential tool for your anxiety utility belt,

i have pretty bad body anxiety like you and a general rule ive adopted is that if i feel any weird sort of vague physical sensation that seems strange or not quite real i go ""oh thats just my brain being a wiener again lewl fuck off kid"" and ill distract myself with something else/ continue as if it never happened. as soon as you stop to dwell on whether youre ok or not its game over. i try to use that same frantic thought pattern that gets my anxiety worked up to think about something outside myself.

thats a fine tip and all, but it probably wont help much if your racing thoughts prevent you from seeing it that way in the first place. to help rectify this, for me, its about turning off an overactive internal dialogue, which is my second tip. you should really take inventory on what that pesky monologue is saying and whether or not its of value. ive been so bad with this that i make a habit of narrating every tiny movement of my body and thing i do in my head. ""pick up cereal box. open box, take bag out. pour into bowl. open fridge with other hand. grab milk by the handle. pour milk slowly so it doesnt splash."" now that might sound crazy to someone mentally healthy, but to me or you it might sound normal. how fucked up is that? bruh think about it. do you really need all these neurons firin' away to do such a nothing task?

the answer is no you dumbass. you think that a species capable of creating such incredible tech and beautiful  pieces of art needs to have this neurotic hyper-vigilance consciously focusing on something as basic as how they move their arm? let ur fukin cerebellum take care of that shit. MILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION WILL DO THE WORK FOR YOU. you can be thinking about LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE. if thats too hard at first (it was for me), then talk to yourself out loud. sing or hum a song, freestyle about what ur doin and make fun of yourself. fill up that thought cue with anything other than ""oh shit my shoulders are tense. i need to relax. relax. come on just relax. please relax. just relax. why cant i relax? what the fuck. fuck just relax."", and youll find that youre incapable of launching that garbage waste of valuable brain RAM known as anxiety\_microscope.exe

think about it! really. if your anxiety makes you incapable of thinking or doing other things, whos to say that you cant flip that on its head and find something that makes you unable to entertain that anxiety in the corner of your mind? another example is social anxiety, which i struggle with hella bad. sometimes im incapable of formulating words because the anxiety is the loudest voice in the room. BUT WAIT. johnnys tellin me about his retarded friend that went to the ER bc he shoved grapes up his nose to sooth his nostrils after he snorted cocaine infused with shards of glass. that sounds much more interesting than my dumb fuckin brain playin make believe by itself. other people are a lot more interesting than you, and as soon as you become invested in what those other people are saying, that anxiety just fades back into the ether.

sounds easy. its not. i got to that point after a lot of exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. you can use this same logic when u find yourself thinking about your body. whats more interesting? whether or not your muscles are relaxed, or a touching video of a dude saving a feral cat and its kittens? i guess this is the stereotypical ""just distract yourself"" advice, but that makes it easy to let that become another thought loop, which is important to avoid. ""ok i just need to distract myself. dont think about it. i just dont have to think about how tense i am. why isnt it working? man im so tense......."". so on and so on.

why should anxiety be this big scary thought eater when 90 percent of the time its a useless piece of shit? fuck that. im not gonna let anxiety shove its dick in my face and get away with it. yeah sometimes the little bitch wins but u know every dog has its day. bitch ass is only 3 inches hard anyway. psh anxiety yeh more like ""i cant pleasure a woman""

anyway, im a big advocate of no psuedo science hippie bullshit, but theres alotta shit that science/medicine doesnt know enough about yet, and the relationship between the body and mind is one of those turds. like you, ive tried so many things to relax my muscles and calm my mind but none of them were a permanent solution. i still have plenty of bad days, still get migraines every once in a while, but its a big improvement. it might work for you. i also find that 4 7 8 breathing exercise works for me sometimes. anxiety is the cuntiest thing in that the more you try to not be anxious the worse it gets. hope any of this helps, even for just a little bit. and u know what if it doesnt work for you then its on to the next thing to try. i know its disheartening when you feel like trying then failing is all you do, but keep trying, try till u cant take anymore, then try 10 times after that. sorry this was a bit long-winded. satan bless you if u made it through this. Lemme know what you think of TMS tho."
