It‚Äôs been two days with no drugs, no alcohol, no binging, no purging. Please take care of yourself and know that you aren‚Äôt alone.

She might just be awful but I just see so much of myself at my worst sometimes in her videos it gives me a lot to reflect on. I look at the way she lies and my eating disorders have driven me to lie CONSTANTLY to so many people in my life... whether it‚Äôs telling people I‚Äôve eaten or not eaten or not binged or not purged.

I know this may be unsolicited advice but please read if you wish to :) getting help may seem like an embarrassment and a shameful process but these things rarely just evaporate. If your ED is driving you to the point of suicide please consider going to talk to someone you trust and a professional. It may seem miserable but if your life is on the line it‚Äôs worth it. There is no shame in getting help, therapy, or medication. I was about your age when I started Vyvanse, a medication that is known to help with binge eating (I‚Äôm not saying that you should take it but it‚Äôs an option). Of course everything is different depending on the person but please greatly consider seeing somebody for your ED or at least talk to somebody that may be able to help. There is so much you have ahead of you and I am so proud of you for continuing."

When I tell you hate I mean like I went through intense bouts of paranoia and panic every time he‚Äôd go out. 

I realized that it‚Äôs so toxic for me to demand that he stays in just to FaceTime me or something like that. I decided that I was just going to start encouraging him to go out when he expressed that he wanted to. When he‚Äôd go out I would just play video games or something that I enjoy to distract me. Eventually you get used to it. I still have episodes of panic when he goes out and I‚Äôll say stupid shit like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cheat on me,okay?‚Äù But at the end of the day I‚Äôm progressing. I know it doesn‚Äôt sound helpful but the absolute best way to deal with it is to just deal with it. Whenever you feel anxious about your partner going out, just do something to distract yourself and fight the feelings of needing validation at that exact second. It‚Äôs really fucking hard but it‚Äôs so worth it. You‚Äôll give in to the irrational thoughts once in a while but everyday is a new opportunity to be better.

BPD,f4dfd41,t1_f4d7dam,1571541866.0,"I‚Äôm excited to try it! If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, do you ever find it difficult to assign a percentage chance for something? I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to quantify a realistic percentage or putting a number to it would just make it seem like ‚Äúoh so there actually *is* a chance...‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean to criticize this technique or anything I was just wondering if you ever have had a problem with this :)"
BPD,f4d65bq,t1_f4d3nbg,1571538492.0,This is AMAZING advice... seriously I thought it was a shot in the dark posting this here cause my original post was such a mess but this seriously is wonderful advice. I can‚Äôt thank you enough üíñ
depression,f4bfomv,t3_dk7cik,1571511770.0,This happens to me a lot. I think mine is mostly related to anxiety but if I think about anything upsetting or potentially triggering while I‚Äôm eating I‚Äôll instantly become nauseous or vomit. I also have a history with eating disorders tho so maybe it‚Äôs related to that for me. When I‚Äôm really down I can‚Äôt keep food down or I‚Äôll take a couple bites and just feel absolutely sick and have to stop eating
Anxiety,f48gdp0,t3_djuo73,1571438634.0,"Honestly this might not be the right thing to say, but I struggle with terrible social and general anxiety and my boyfriend has helped me by pushing me to do what I‚Äôm uncomfortable with socially. He tells me that I just have to give it a try and he always tells me that he has a back up plan if things get awkward or if I‚Äôm really uncomfortable. For example, I was panicking about socializing with his roommates and neighbors and he sat me down and said that I have to go out and at least try and if I don‚Äôt like it we can leave and go see a movie. I went out and we had tons of fun. He was with me throughout it, but now I‚Äôm comfortable socializing with them without him. I‚Äôm not sure how she‚Äôll respond to being pushed but personally that helped me. Keep in mind he did it in a loving way and was always near enough to be there if I needed him so it wasn‚Äôt like I was just thrown into it. 

Sorry if this isn‚Äôt what you were looking for but this is what my boyfriend did to help with my anxiety. You‚Äôre a good person for caring so much and trying to help!"
BPD,f47w7b5,t3_djs8me,1571428883.0,"I was majorly right one time and I‚Äôm still trying to get over it. It‚Äôs really tough. I‚Äôve gotten better about taking things as they come and trying not to over analyze every word (or lack thereof). 

What makes me stop worrying so much is reminding myself that what‚Äôs happening is happening and if someone is pulling away, who am I to stop them? If they want out of my life then they probably aren‚Äôt best to be present in my life, and if it‚Äôs just in my head then it‚Äôs in my head. I distract myself with other stuff and usually whatever I‚Äôm feeling passes. It‚Äôs tough af to get over it tbh but I just remind myself that constantly hounding someone about not pulling away only can drive them to pull away, it‚Äôs not healthy for anybody. The concept of abandonment is so harrowing but the world keeps turning and life goes on. Sometimes I just tell myself that when people pull away it makes more space for me to learn how to love myself better :)"
