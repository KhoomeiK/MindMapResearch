I was in a relationship with a guy for many years. At some point my mother made me a quilt. I loved that quilt. The colors, the fabrics. My mother makes lots of things that I don't find aesthetically pleasing, so this quilt was special to me. My husband knew how much it meant to me. So he started using it to cover up with on the couch. He smoked and was always dropping ashes everywhere. I asked him  repeatedly not to use my quilt because he was going to ruin it. He would just ignore me. He would also drink red wine while wrapped up in this quilt. I begged him not to use the quilt while he was drinking. He didn't care. There were several cigarette holes in it and wine stains on it. Nothing would stop him from using my quilt.

One day, he and my quilt were hanging out in the garage together, because that's what one does. I hear him yelling about something so I rush over to see what's going on. My quilt was on fire. He put the fire out, but about half of the quilt was gone at that point. He claims it was an accident, and although I can't prove it, I think he set it on fire on purpose. I was so hurt and angry.

At this point we were already in an ever escalating abuse situation. And it only got much worse after this, like swat team at my house worse, so I don't think you're over-reacting at all. I know all relationships are different and we're all under considerable stress right now, but destroying her game like that feels like a red flag to me.

I show up on time and I have to leave work, drive 15 - 30 minutes, find parking and walk to his office. He has 15 minutes between clients. All he has to do is stand up and open his door. As I said, I'm fine with a minute or two, but there has to be a line drawn somewhere. Where is it for you? 5 minutes? 10 minutes? I only get 45 minutes and those are my minutes. I'm paying for each and every one of them. I need those minutes. 

If he pops his head out the door and says ""hey, I'm running a little late"", I'm fine with that too. Because he respected me enough to inform me what was going on instead of just leaving me sitting there. I've adjusted my session start times to accommodate the client before me and been very flexible when he's asked me to change my day or time.

I'm totally understanding if it's not an every-session kind of thing. Mine has been late from time to time and has apologized for it. He used to be chronically late by 3 - 6 minutes and when I brought it to his attention he apologized and fixed it. I'm mostly ok with being one or two minutes late. But other than that, they need to figure out their schedule, leave more time between clients, or something. Depending on the client and their history, and I guess I'm talking about myself here, the lateness hurts. If it's more than a few minutes and I'm in the wrong headspace, I start to feel rejected and that I'm not important enough and the fact that it's my therapist makes the feeling more intense and more painful than if my boss was late to our one-on-one.

therapy,fn1gk1h,t3_fypd2t,1586561556.0,"Man, saying things out loud can be hard. There have been a few times where I've had a really hard time saying something out loud to my therapist. Once we spent what felt like most of the session with me just trying to say one sentence. He was so patient, didn't try to force me. He asked if I wanted to write it down and I finally agreed to do that and even that was hard. It ended up feeling like a really powerful session, like we'd been some ordeal together. I had told him ahead of time that I had this thought I needed to get out, so he knew something was coming.

More recently I sent him an email before session and told him I wanted to talk about something very bluntly instead of tiptoeing around it like I usually do. I told him I was going to have to use a phrase that I wasn't sure I could say out loud. I asked if he could not sit too far away from me. He offered to close the blinds or adjust the temperature or anything else I could think of that would make it feel easier. It was a rough session that ended with me in a shame spiral, but I think it helped that we planned to have this talk and that he was willing to modify the space. 

I don't know if these anecdotes are helpful. Talking ahead of time and planning to have a big conversation were helpful to me. In general, I think working up to saying something is also helpful. You can start small. You don't have to tell him everything at once. Writing things down is also helpful for me, but I sometimes wonder if talking leads to more healing. Another idea is could you tell him you're having trouble saying a word out loud and ask him to say 'sex' out loud to see how that feels and then try to say it yourself.

therapy,fjutlpx,t3_fezluw,1583620106.0,"Sometimes I've been afraid if I tell my therapist this one thing, that's going to be the thing that makes him change his mind about me and he'll finally see that I'm a terrible person. In the 3 years we've been working together, it hasn't happened. He usually expresses gratitude that I shared with him and tells me that it makes him feel more connected to me. He's never judged me. That being said, it has taken time and developing trust with him for me to open up more. 

I don't think it's necessary to bare your soul to them straight away if you're not comfortable doing that. If you have a trauma history, you might end up retraumatizing yourself by opening up too much too fast. I think it would be a waste of time and money to outright lie to your therapist, but slowly unraveling your story over time is perfectly acceptable. I do think you should try to push yourself to the edge of your comfort zone and then a little bit further. It's hard knowing how hard to push. Sometimes I push too far and I end up dysregulated or feel like I'm totally exposed and end up seeking reassurance.

Everyone's different of course, but when I'm having trouble opening up about something, I'll write it down and either email it or bring it to session. Writing may not work for you. Maybe have a conversation with your therapist about your trouble opening up and your fears surrounding it. Ask them what their philosophy is about being nonjudgmental and how they do that (I asked this question once and the response was reassuring). Brainstorm with them for some ideas about things that you or your therapist could do to make it easier for you to open up. Talk about talking about a certain topic.

He refused to help me look for them so I was alone, in the dark on my hands and knees feeling around in our yard trying to find them. I still remember that feeling of helplessness and panic. It's not funny to keep your glasses from you when you absolutely need them to do basic stuff.

At the time, I just thought he was being a dick, but after many more years and other abusive stuff happening, I can now see this incident as one of the many red flags that I completely missed.

Abuse is a pattern of controlling behavior. I don't know exactly what to think about her confiscating your glasses for sex. I think it's up to you to decide if all those times felt like attempts to exert control over you. But her reaction when you asked her to stop, you feeling like you needed to sleep with them, and her breaking them are totally unacceptable. If she's really as great as you say she is, maybe consider seeing a couples therapist to see if you can work this out, but only if you see no other red flags in her behavior. Or even better, go see a therapist by yourself and get some professional, non-judgmental input about your relationship. Don't listen to what your friends are telling you.

Therapy was helping me see the truth of the relationship and it was starting to help me disentangle my identity from the identity I had as part of the relationship because I had definitely lost myself somewhere along the way. It got really rough and the emotional abuse was very hard to take and I'm still struggling with how it's affected me. I think I would have figured out how to leave eventually but I felt stuck at the time because he had nothing financially other than what I provided and I assumed he would end up homeless if I kicked him out and I didn't want to be responsible for causing that.

Leaving is hard. But you can do it. You already know that you're miserable and that what he's doing is abuse so you're already part of the way there. You just need to find the rest of the path leading out. Connect with your local DV agency and put together a safety plan, even if you don't think you'll leave. It sounds like he's escalating. This is just a hypothesis I have, but I think that the more they talk about hurting you, the easier it becomes for them to actually hurt you. My ex was threatening to kill me and I really feel like him saying it out loud to me somehow made it more concrete and more okay for him to act on those words. Having thought about how you would get out of a dangerous situation, or even just some night when he's berating you and you can't take it anymore, will give you some peace of mind and empower you.

It might also be good to look into local DV support groups. I started going at the urging of my therapist. I felt like I didn't belong there because it was ""only emotional abuse"" and I was having a hard time even labeling it abuse. I got so much validation from the other women in the group that what was going on at home was not okay and that it was okay for me to have feelings about it. They had all been physically abused and they accepted me wholeheartedly. I also learned that a lot of the stuff he was doing was actually physically and sexually abusive when I might not have labeled it that before.

>The primary reason we don’t recommend couples counseling is that **abuse is not a “relationship problem**.**”** Couples counseling may imply that both partners contribute to the abusive behavior, when *the choice to be abusive lies solely with the abusive partner*. Focusing on communication or other relationship issues distracts from the abusive behavior, and may actually reinforce it in some cases. Additionally, a therapist may not be aware that abuse is present and inadvertently encourage the abuse to continue or escalate.

>Both partners should feel and be safe in order for therapy to be effective. A victim may not feel safe with their abuser present and could be hesitant to fully participate or speak honestly during counseling sessions.

Is he in jail or some other reason he can't physically come get his stuff? Is there a restraining order? If so, you can arrange for the sheriff to accompany him to get his stuff.

If she's harassing you at work, especially because she shows no sign of letting up, I'd go have a talk with HR or a manager that you trust. If you have anyone that can confirm what you're saying, be sure to let them know. Unfortunately, she might turn around and accuse you of sexual harassment, so be prepared for that as well. It's usually better if you tell your story first I think. There's a great advice column called Ask A Manager that probably has something similar to your situation in their archives. And there's probably a sub for HR related advice too, although I've never looked so I don't know. You shouldn't have to continue to put up with this though.

I think this would fall under harassment, not emotional abuse, though my experience with emotional abuse is within an intimate relationship and that's how I tend to view it. That doesn't mean you're not impacted by it and your feelings are completely justified."

Before this my parents had been very open about the adoption and seemed to have no issue with any curiosity I had. I'm pretty sure this incident was the first time I openly expressed a desire to find my bio mother though. I don't remember when it came up next, but after this she was supportive of any searching I wanted to do. I haven't ever done a wholehearted search, mainly because I'm afraid I would be rejected by my birth mother and I don't think I could handle that.

I also want to point out that your daughter asked you to go with her. You're her mom and meeting her birth family is a huge deal and she wants you to be there with her. She wants to share this experience with you. If she didn't love you and think of you as her real mom, she wouldn't have asked."
AmItheAsshole,fec16l4,t3_eo6j73,1578965139.0,"YTA. I'm an adoptee. This isn't about you, but you're making it all about you. 

In the adoption triad, two parties had a choice. One had absolutely no say in the matter. You don't get to dictate how your daughter feels about her adoption or about her birth family. You're entitled to your own feelings, but as the parent, you need to deal with those feelings on your own and not lay them on your daughter. It might be helpful to unpack your feelings with a therapist.

I can guarantee your daughter is feeling very conflicted right now between her loyalty to her mother and her desire to learn where she comes from. When I was about 14 I told my mother that I wanted to search for my birth mother and she started crying. Her reaction felt so terrible to me and I still feel guilty for making her cry that day. The thing is, it had nothing to do with her or how I was raised or whether I was happy or not or how I felt about my mother. It had everything to do with my needing to know about where I came from. Her desire to know her roots does not mean she loves you any less or that you are suddenly not her mom anymore. 

You seem to love your daughter. Instead of feeling hatred for her bio mom, try to reframe it as being grateful for the sacrifice she made. If she hadn't needed to give up her daughter, you wouldn't have her in your life now."

Insurance is so variable. Mine covers once a week (although I'm actually going 3x/week). They covered twice a week for a while but finally balked and said I needed a higher level of care (whatever that means) if I was going twice a week. Even at once a week, my therapist has to periodically get on the phone and convince them that I still need therapy. I don't know why getting the level of mental health care that you need has to be so difficult."

OP, if you're unhappy in the relationship, whether it's abusive or not, you can end it. You don't need an excuse to leave. Get a copy of ""Why Does He Do That"" and see if it sounds like your relationship."

My ex loves roller coasters so one year for his birthday I thought I'd surprise him and take him to Six Flags. I spent weeks psyching myself up and telling myself that I could get on one and how fun it would be. When we got there, I thought it best to start small and so we rode the mine car ride. It was pretty fast and jerked you around pretty violently and I was screaming my head off the whole ride. When the ride ended, some dude a few cars ahead of us just turned around and looked at me like I was the craziest person he'd ever seen.

I get it. It's hard to not try to figure out what you could have done differently. I do it all the time myself. When I think back to the night he set our house on fire, I have examined and reexamined everything I did that day trying to figure out where I went wrong. Why did he do it? I'm not sure these questions are answerable really. I understand why you're asking though. 

As far as calling yourself a victim, you don't have to. You could call yourself a survivor if that feels better. Or you don't have to call yourself anything. You can call the relationship abusive without labeling yourself. If you're struggling with how to talk about this with people, you don't necessarily have to label it, although you can. You could say that there were some things that happened that felt scary and confusing and go from there. 

Have you considered going to therapy to talk about all this stuff? I've found it helpful to have a forum to discuss it in. I feel ashamed about the things that happened so most people know very little about what was going on for me. I still feel ashamed in therapy, but I know my therapist believes me and has told me how bad things actually were and supports me. I highly recommend therapy."
domesticviolence,favbg3e,t3_eao8jz,1576357326.0,"I think a lot of people have the tendency to minimize the abusive things that have happened to them. 

My relationship experience was of mostly emotional abuse. But there was that one time that he hit me upside the head out of nowhere. Does that count as abuse even though it only happened one time? Or what about the time he had sex with me when I told him to stop? Does that count as sexual assault even though I didn't fight him off? Or what about all those times when he wouldn't let me leave the room or slammed things around me or told me how easy it would be to kill me? He never beat me up. Does that still count as abuse? What about the night he set our house on fire? Okay, maybe that's a bad example, because I'm actually not sure if that counts as part of his abuse. Although I've gotten more comfortable with it, I still find it difficult to label what happened as abuse, or I question whether it was bad enough to call it abuse. I find it difficult to call him my abuser. It can be hard to look at our own experiences objectively. It's so easy to blame myself for things that happened, especially because he told me it was my fault. His emotional abuse of me was pervasive and has damaged me. My husband has a history or sexual and likely emotional abuse from his childhood. He was also an alcoholic. That does not excuse him for his treatment of me. He's an alcoholic. He's also an abuser. They are separate. He had good qualities. He's not all bad. But he did some really shitty things to me. He can be both. 

Objectively, he choked you. He abused you. There's no excuse for that. Doesn't matter what you did or didn't do. That's on him. It's really great that you've gotten away from him. Do whatever it takes to keep yourself away from him. Ultimately, you get to define your own experience. If you find something helpful about labeling the relationship and him as abusive, then do so. No one is going to gatekeep abuse in your case, because it seems clear to me that it was abusive. If it's not helpful to you, you don't have to. I wish you the best."
