TwoXSex,fr5dez0,t1_fr4xdbe,1589906724.0,"Omg please RUN far away from this guy. How could you possibly like someone who treats you this way after only two weeks? That’s no time at all and better to cut your ties now. I really hope the plan b works for your sake and if I were you I would block him from contacting you at all. Please stop having sex with this guy. 

From my perspective you are highly intuitive and smart, but you’re making a dumb decision here so I’m gonna guess that you’re younger and inexperienced. This guy is treating you no better than a piece of trash from his
McDonald’s happy meal he got last week. Please please, move on and stop having sex with this imbecile. There’s no way you can judge his character after only two weeks and say he’s a great guy besides this incident. This incident is telling you what kind of guy he is. I think the random water bottle by my bed has been in my room longer than you’ve been seeing this guy and I would trust this piece of plastic more than you’re trusting him. Once again PLEASE drop him. You deserve so much better. He actually is disgusting by just your description of his attitude and actions. 🤮

No respectable guy will make you feel like shit about using a condom and put all the responsibility on you for birth control. Even in a long term commitment where I’ve been on birth control, I still expect the guy to respect issues I have to deal with over bc side effects or if I have to get a plan b I would expect a guy to either go half and half or even buy it in full if it’s his mistake like this guy did to you. 

The last thing I would describe this as is kind. Remember great chemistry doesn’t equal love. This guy either is showing you huge red flags that he’s an abuser or he’s just really young and needs a lot more time and experience to grow tf up and treat a woman correctly. Either way don’t wait around to find out."
awakened,fr5bxpg,t3_gmfduj,1589906017.0,"I think this applies to going through abusive relationships too. I grew up in a relatively safe environment. I did grow up with a single mom who did snap a lot, but I’m not sure that made me an empath or not. I think she did make me co dependent, so I guess so. It’s just crazy how impressionable you are as a child. 

I don’t remember being an empath when I was a teenager though or even after graduating high school. I remember being pretty harsh and only caring about myself (in a normal sense). I didn’t take shit from anyone really. But when I was 20 I met a guy at college. I was in a relationship with him for 4-5 years off and on. 

He was abusive in every way... emotionally, mentally, physically, verbally. I’m very hyper vigilant now and can feel peoples moods and energies. I can tell when people are getting annoyed, hurt by something someone said, want to remove themselves from a certain environment, whether someone’s lying or not, etc. I feel like I’m more in tune with how others feel than how I feel myself. It’s been a learning process learning how to care about my own feelings again. I haven’t seen that ex since I was 25 and I’m 29 now. I’ve also been in another abusive relationship since then. It was a shorter relationship, but it made me realize I was putting myself through the same cycle. I think I’ll always be an empath now, but I’ve been learning to love  and observe myself in the same way I started doing that to others."

adhdwomen,fqz7vna,t3_glku8n,1589761721.0,"I’ve read this question here not too long ago, so maybe it’s possible. I’m 29 and have been in 2 abusive relationships. 

The thing is, the ones that aren’t narcissists or emotionally unavailable I am not attracted to. I’m guessing because they don’t offer my brain enough stimulation. In those cases, I tend to stir up my own issues and claim that I’m not happy because of them. I was just diagnosed last year and I’ve been single for 8 months. I’ve been doing some deep healing and trying to observe my choices more, boundaries and really try to make better decisions. I’m so cautious now I even monitor my texts and how much energy I’m giving. I try to make sure if I’m interested in someone that there’s a balanced energy and try to keep myself from chasing any highs or causing any lows. To do this, I’ve tried remaining calm over my emotions and communicate later when I’ve thought through things because 9/10 with adhd, my assumptions are not even reality and I overthought it. I still address my feelings and make sure they are heard by the other person. I’m also trying to take things slow with a guy I really like right now. He’s a little bit dismissive avoidant and I’m fearful avoidant but I know we both have a lot of love for each other and he understands me/respects me for all that I am. It’s pretty cool, but this is when I have to keep the reigns on myself. Like even today I impulsively wanted to hang out with him and sleep with him but I’m trying to not do that. 

If someone values you, taking things slow will prove their worth in your life and if they value you or not. 

Just don’t trust anyone trying to move too fast or love bomb you when they barely know you! That’s the biggest red flag that someone is some form of an abuser. Sure, there’s exceptions but listen to your gut about it. There’s some other guy who’s been trying to talk to me during quarantine and wants to meet me. I’ve kept him at a far distance, but I was FaceTiming him for fun for a couple weeks. He was giving off red flags and being too direct sexually so it didn’t sit right with me. Yesterday he said he wants to meet today and that we should get a hotel room. I didn’t even reply and blocked him on all social media platforms. 

I have been through emotional, verbal and physical abuse. It’s a hard path to healing but you’ll learn to trust yourself eventually. Some days are harder than others. Most importantly love yourself and focus on yourself and the right person will show up. Make logical judgments from there and keep boundaries."

My ex also slut shamed me because I slept with an ex during a 2 month break up (who I used a condom with and took plan b because I’m that cautious) and he also slept with a complete STRANGER using no condom and gave me gonorrhea and bacterial vaginosis. These men are disgusting. My nex also texted me on my birthday saying I’ll always be in his heart... we hadn’t spoke in 4 months and the last thing he said was how everything was my fault and gave me paragraphs of reasons why he’s leaving me (even though I left him lol).

People will say “you’re still young” “there’s always next year” but like honestly I’ve really been trying to mature and grow up and as much as I love the scene and love my memories over the years going to all these raves, I really want to move into other experiences like traveling. 

I personally don’t plan on raving once I’m married and have kids because my life is just shifting and as much as I’d like to show my future husband a rave one time, it’s just not something I’ll continue to plan as I go into my 30s. I was gonna do edc this year and then HARD since I’ve never gone to that one. I’m really bummed events may not happen for who knows how long and I won’t be to another rave in my 20s. I’d honestly expect maybe 2 years until there’s another one. It’s really fucking sad. 

I wish I were 23 and could care less still, but I’ve definitely been detoxing from raves and doing mdma. There’s no “oh you can go again when they’re allowed”
By that time, I’d hope my life is in a different place and not holding onto these events and doing drugs. People say just don’t do them, but it is very common and normalized. I have adhd so it’s really hard to resist temptation and the fact that I know how amazing raves are when rolling. Hard to not remember that or want to do it when I’m there.

relationships,fq57o1e,t3_ggnnxc,1589095242.0,"Hopefully you see my comment..... but girl, this sexual and intimate relationship isn’t sustainable for you. I have been there before, but it comes down to incompatibility. I know you probably love him, but it seems to be taking a toll on you and quite frankly, he’s being a little bit emotionally abusive. I’m only saying that because I’ve been through these exact types of relationships. It’s a lack of respect, understanding, compassion, etc on his part!! That is NOT love. 

The fact that you try to talk about it and he makes it about himself and his feelings being hurt... it’s just a huge red flag. I’m not saying to leave and end things, but I am saying take note of this and any other red flags from him. This reaction on his part just doesn’t sit right with me.

My ex was the same way. Sex became a chore to me and I knew we always had to do it. At first I could keep up doing it 3-4 times a day, but I would get constant yeast infections. I had probably 10 yeast infections in one year while with him and I had only had like 2 total prior to that! Yes, there’s lube and all that but vaginas are so sensitive and a lot of sex also does cause utis. Then when I didn’t want to have sex, it was at least a hand/blow job while we watched something. It also took away from my own life and things I liked to enjoy or spending time doing hobbies. I felt like it was just too constant and overwhelming and our life circled around his sexual satisfaction. It’s great to pleasure your partner, but there’s a fine line between romantic and sexual love... some guys just don’t get it that as girls we need the romantic intimacy. I’m really sorry you’re going through this with him, I just know the struggle and the fact he’s making it about himself really upsets me for you!! Ugh."

therapy,fpqdybg,t3_gevlkd,1588820643.0,"I don’t have trauma necessarily from my mom, but I did have a lot of resentment and anger from her neglecting me and because my dad wasn’t around/I had never met him. I never felt angry at my dad either, just wish that I knew him and I wish I had someone there to protect me as that translated a lot into my adult life/dating narcissists who pretended like they could save me type of thing. I did subconsciously feel that anger toward my mom though. That came out with a recent therapist I saw a few months ago and finally at 29 I feel so much better. I rarely think of my dad or care to meet him anymore and I’ve finally forgiven my mom. We have a much better relationship. I realized she raised me from how she was raised and whatever issues she had. I decided to break that cycle and I hope when I have kids, they will feel my love constantly and hopefully have a loving father too. 

Here’s to hoping. I hope everything goes well for you!"

antidepressants,fppt2i7,t1_fppobtl,1588808601.0,"True. Usually I think of the excitement of going to Disneyland or something, but you’re right... our interests change and so should our excitement. Maybe you just haven’t found what your passion is? I’ve done a lot of self reflection in quarantine and it’s helped a lot. Try getting to know yourself or try new things you’ve wanted to, read a book that interests you off amazon. Just to start and try to snowball from there. 

Not trying to undermine medication, but sometimes you gotta help the medication along. It’s just a crutch you know and you have to pick up the slack while it’s trying to help you."
antidepressants,fppkbl5,t3_geovox,1588803865.0,"Is Wellbutrin not one? I’ve been on it a year and a half and it works great. I don’t have any side effects, except I think it may have caused cystic acne but I’m not sure since there aren’t any studies on it. At least I’m not depressed anymore though. They say it’s a mild stimulant, but I’ll see how it’s really altered my brain as I’m currently tapering off of it. I do find joy in things and have more energy now, but honestly I don’t think we’ll ever feel the same joy as we did as kids... but that’s just my personal opinion. I believe anhedonia is just part of being an adult, unfortunately. 

I have been finding moments of peace and happiness lately, but I think that’s also from my own inner work and enlightenment. 

I’m sure there will be joy in small moments like having a child or getting married or maybe getting a promotion. Who knows because I haven’t experienced those things yet haha."

Every post I came across was like “got t-boned on Sunday blah blah now I need a new truck” and another was “a flat tire?! I don’t need this today” lmao like why do people posts this melodramatic shit. If something like that happens to me I honestly just deal with it and stay quiet. I’ll maybe call my mom and that’s about it. Another girl posted a photo of Adele and said she’s TOO skinny now. I know this girl in real life and she’s overweight with a weird shaped body... yet judging Adele for being too skinny lmao. It’s like they want attention or something, but the thing is i find myself judging them... so I hate how that makes me no better than they are... which brings me back from wanting to distance from social media as a whole. I get so much more done and then come to reddit for real discussions and interesting stuff/knowledge."

antidepressants,fplvb9f,t1_fpkpnsc,1588720167.0,"For me it was the opposite about the irritation. At first Wellbutrin made it worse, but after a couple months I stopped having road rage and all that. I’m tapering off right now and I’ve noticed my impatience coming back :/

But to OP: Wellbutrin worked very well for me as far as depression. I’ve been on it a year and a half. I think it does effect hormones here or there, sometimes I’d have a high/normal libido and other times it would be down. Just depends on life circumstances too. I think it does help with adhd, but it’s definitely not as affective as an actual stimulant. I wouldn’t recommend a stimulant with Wellbutrin though. I tried that for 3 months and had multiple panic attacks (but that’s just me so idk)."

Anxiety,fpfs82f,t3_gd34dh,1588581608.0,"Omg I’m going through this right now. Not as extreme, but I think tomorrow I’m going to have to make a decision and unfortunately it’s not one that will bring immediate joy. I got laid off “temporarily” in March and my supervisor called me to come in for a meeting tomorrow. I’m dreading it because if they say I can come back, I’m unable to say no (which is what I’ve decided I want— I plan on changing career paths) I can’t say no because then my unemployment will be taken away... which has really been helping me pay off debt I was drowning in (that $600 a week + $350 for
regular unemployment... I’m making $915 a week doing
nothing but what I want to do). It’s funny because when they first let me go, which was a phone call, I cried at Wal mart while shopping. Now, they may be offering it back and I want to cry because I’ve realized how happy I’ve been 😭 I don’t want to go back to “normal” I want to be free. I honestly forgot what anxiety felt like. 

I’ve been learning other things that interest me, going on two walks a day with my dogs, helping my mom grocery shop... I’m going to be so depressed if I have to go back. 

I’ve been thinking about hawaii a lot too. I went a few years ago and it was amazing. Just rented a Jeep and explored the big
Island for 3 days."

relationship_advice,fpf7wkj,t1_fpf71lp,1588563937.0,"Yeah np! I've been learning about it a lot lately because I was dating someone who was dismissive. Check out this psychologist on YouTube, her YouTube name is Personal Development School - Thais Gibson. I learned a crap ton from her and you can learn about your own attachment style too and combined styles in relationships as well how to navigate through them. Plus all the comments from others who understand is really comforting too!

Also, don't listen to people saying he's cheating...that's of course everyones go-to here, but from the sounds of it that would honestly be too obvious he was cheating so I highly doubt that's what he's doing lol unless he's that dumb to make it so obvious. Usually if someone is cheating they would go above and beyond to not let their partner become suspicious. Since he's always been like this and you have a great relationship otherwise, I'd assume it's just how he is and probably a big introvert too."

relationship_advice,fpf6csi,t3_gd40qc,1588562859.0,"Seems like he has a dismissive avoidant attachment style. From how well you handle it, it seems like you have a secure attachment, which is normal and healthy but you still definitely deserve more time from your spouse. You have two problems though, one is that he spends so much time away from you and two that he’s not communicating with you and hearing you out on your feelings. So, there definitely needs to be more communication here and if he’s not budging on that I would bring up couples counseling to have a mediator between you two and so that it can’t turn into an argument when you try to express your feelings.

Dismissive avoidants need a lot of time alone and they usually make most of their time for work or anything else that keeps them at a distance from people they could be closer to. It’s a lot of subconscious fear based stuff and as a child he was probably used to just doing things on his own and not relying on anyone else. Also, I’ve heard that around 6-7 years dismissive avoidants pull back from sex and don’t initiate a lot... idk if this is happening for you but just in case it resonates with you."
