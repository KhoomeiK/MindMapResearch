Spending my entire senior year with someone i had gotten to know who had quickly become my best friend, spending all summer with him, going to college in the same town together and finally dating. Graduating high school and getting into my dream college to study music education. After being rejected 2 for all-state choir, i finally got to go as a collegiate student and travelled alone for the first time. I got to learn new things, meet new people, saw beautiful things and got to do things i never thought i’d do. I got to meet my favorite composers at all different events. Despite the fact I struggle with severe anxiety now, I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Life is so precious and delicate. I can’t wait for what it holds for me.

I wanted to tell her all about it at a little friend get together at her house but she hung out with other kids and at some point they all turned to me told me nobody cared and that she didn’t want to be friends anymore. I went into  a new school with no friends. I had another guy best friend who i had a crush on for 6 years, kissed me, tell me he just felt bad, and i’ve only seen him a few times the past few years. We’re supposed to hang out today actually and catch up. He’s the worst texter you’ll ever meet. I would ask him how he was doing for months and never hear back. We’d make plans and he’d flake and never tell me. It’s sad, we used to be really close. Another graduated high school and just left to live with her boyfriend in California. We still comment on each other’s posts on IG. Another left school early and we don’t talk much anymore. Only the occasional snap convo. He’s dating one of my current best friend’s friends. They’re so much alike and I wish them the best. Another I still talk to but we’re not as close anymore. We still hang out but usually because her mom invites us over, we see her musicals, or it’s a party. Another one from school and I used to be pretty close. This year he just didn’t talk to me. We did a group project in math and he never did any work, he was never in school for chorus and the few times we talked he never made eye contact, rolled his eyes, or corrected me. Oh, and he called my best friend (the one who was friends with the guy who was dating my ex-best friend), a two-faced bitch. That girl is the LEAST amount of two faced she doesn’t even SWEAR. People beat her up all the time and say nasty shit about her because they’re entitled musical kids who didn’t get what the wanted. So I decided to call it off on him. I have another best friend who is best friends with the last guy and even though we don’t talk much, when we do get together it’s like time never passed. We still laugh together and her laugh is contagious but every time we see each other again I know we only grow more distant and it’s only a matter of time. I had a friend who i grew close with this year who is just a TERRIBLE texter and now that we’re going to college, I know i’ll lose contact with him too.

I wasn’t a good kisser probably. Next was with my current boyfriend a month after we started dating (September 2018) no little buzz but it was his first kiss. It was cute, in our little fort we built. He got better at it and I honestly think I got worse. During this time I had to kiss someone on stage (March 2019). The kid is my age we grew up together and I had a crush on him throughout elementary school. He’s gay and is sort of large and taller than me. It was GROSS. He sweats like a fountain on stage and never made eye contact with me on stage. We hate each other’s guts off stage because he would say some really nasty stuff or things that would piss me off when I was stressed with our shitty director.
