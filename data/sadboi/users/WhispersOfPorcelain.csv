That being said in the beginning my partner absolute left everything to me as a SAHM and I had no idea how hard that would be and how much of myself I would have to give it was really hard in the beginning but after numerous talks and arguments and making my needs also known we came to a pretty good dynamic.

By the time my second one was born that got thrown out of wack and we had to work on the dynamic yet again, it‚Äôs not the perfect set up and thing‚Äôs always still have room for improvement but we are working harder each and everyday to make sure we do everything we can for each other and the kids. 

Before we had kids we both wanted them, we both had raised our siblings so we knew what we were in for but i came from a household where my mother was a single parent and worked and he came from a household where his parents were married a good chunk of his life and the mother did all the work outside of having a 9-5 job. That is where the challenge came in, he was very set in his way of going to work while i do everything else while he works and thats just too much for one person to take on all the time.

Since you did not bother to read the link here are some examples, also everything I have said is factual and is readily available to be looked up on google, I am not sure why you think you are right but anyone can look up the facts and see you are blatantly wrong not only about ‚Äúhaving to have psychosis to get a schizophrenia or schizoaffective diagnosis‚Äù but also about what the DSM is used for along with what psychiatrists are worth a damn. 


In addition to schizophrenia (see Table 1), other psychotic disorders include schizophreniform disorder (a briefer version of schizophrenia), schizoaffective disorder (a mixture of psychosis and depression/mania symptoms), delusional disorder (the experience of only delusions), and brief psychotic disorder (psychotic symptoms that last only a few days or weeks).


As described above, when we think of the core symptoms of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, we think of people who hear voices, see visions, and have false beliefs about reality (i.e., delusions). However, problems in cognitive function are also a critical aspect of psychotic disorders and of schizophrenia in particular. This emphasis on cognition in schizophrenia is in part due to the growing body of research suggesting that cognitive problems in schizophrenia are a major source of disability and loss of functional capacity (Green, 2006; Nuechterlein et al., 2011). The cognitive deficits that are present in schizophrenia are widespread and can include problems with episodic memory (the ability to learn and retrieve new information or episodes in one‚Äôs life), working memory (the ability to maintain information over a short period of time, such as 30 seconds), and other tasks that require one to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù or regulate one‚Äôs behavior (Barch & Ceaser, 2012; Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009a; Fioravanti, Carlone, Vitale, Cinti, & Clare, 2005; Forbes, Carrick, McIntosh, & Lawrie, 2009; Mesholam-Gately, Giuliano, Goff, Faraone, & Seidman, 2009). Individuals with schizophrenia also have difficulty with what is referred to as ‚Äúprocessing speed‚Äù and are frequently slower than healthy individuals on almost all tasks. Importantly, these cognitive deficits are present prior to the onset of the illness (Fusar-Poli et al., 2007) and are also present, albeit in a milder form, in the first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia (Snitz, Macdonald, & Carter, 2006). This suggests that cognitive impairments in schizophrenia reflect part of the risk for the development of psychosis, rather than being an outcome of developing psychosis. 


Further, people with schizophrenia who have more severe cognitive problems also tend to have more severe negative symptoms and more disorganized speech and behavior

If your new psychiatrist is strictly going by the DSM definition then it is very possible that they might say you do not have schizoaffective disorder, for example a lot of doctors see schizophrenia on the end of where people are vividly hallucinating people or images when in reality the disease is progressive and most early cases might only hallucinate out of the corner of their eye.

Some psychiatrists see schizophrenia paranoia as thinking someone is following you or that your water is poisoned when in reality your symptoms can be as simple as being convinced your significant other is cheating on you despite lack of evidence or reason.

That being said auditory hallucinations is not always related to schizophrenia, it is a cluster of symptoms all together that leads to a schizophrenia or schizoaffective diagnosis.

If you feel like your current psych is not listening or has possibly misdiagnosed you then you should ask them why they feel you do not meet the criteria, what treatment they feel would be best for you, and then decide if you are willing to try it."
