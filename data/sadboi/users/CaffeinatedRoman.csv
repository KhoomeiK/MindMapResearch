smashbros,fek3jkx,t3_epjpn2,1579191854.0,"Interesting choice for the last of the first fighter pass, but honestly Byleth looks the most fun of the Fire Emblo's so far, and three houses was a blast. Not my first choice, but definitely not my last. I'm happy with it. Still rooting for my gal Hornet or my genderless void The Knight, despite the slim chances.

Yeah, Fire Emblem has a lot of characters, especially considering it's franchise size when compared to other games with less slots, (Zelda, Kirby) but keep in mind that Mario has 11 reps (13 if you count Diddy and KRule, but I personally don't) and there are 9 (probably will be 10) playable Pokemon.

In terms of character similarities, I'd also like to point out that there are *three fucking links* and also *dark pit is allowed to exist* as anything other than an alt skin. (Yes he's an echo but still calling bullshit on that.)

And finally: Sakurai loves Fire Emblem, and in the end, it's basically his game, so despite what the masses might want, it's almost common practice to put in a character for each new Fire Emblem. I know Fire Emblem isn't the franchise for everyone. You either like it, or it makes absolutely no fucking sense why anyone would touch the games. But three houses was pretty damn successful. It's the best selling Fire Emblem to date, and it won the fan vote for game of the year. So I do understand why y'all would be upset, but it makes sense, and it's not the worst thing that could've happened."
