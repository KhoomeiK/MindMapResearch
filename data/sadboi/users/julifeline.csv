vegan,evbxzyc,t1_evbxsh6,1564399676.0,No way there are 9 or 10 million vegans in the US. No way
vegan,evbw1dl,t1_evbussg,1564397258.0,"Sure. But come on. The reality is that like 1/2 of 1% of the western population is truly vegan. Max. Sure it’s more than 10 or 20 years ago but u really think this is gonna change significantly? I don’t. Either way, I’ll continue with my vegan life as I can not justify eating dead tortured animals anymore after knowing what I know now."
