relationship_advice,fnqagfl,t3_g30j08,1587160811.0,"Thanks for the replies. I actually brought up the subject two weeks ago. This is what I retained from our discussion:
- he shared he doesn't hold conversations much in general, even with his friends, they spend most of their time in action rather than talking. He confessed it probably comes from the fact that his family didn't talk much with each other, so the thought of starting a deep conversation just doesn't cross his mind much. I have a hard time understanding this kind of mindset, that is totally different from mine, but I've seen it in other guys, so I guess it's just some people's reality.
- he claims that couples don't need to spend their whole time together, which I agree, and that it's normal to do you own thing on the side and that I should focus on what interests me, just the way he does.

And maybe he's right, I'm having a hard time lately finding enjoyment in stuff I used to like. I just consider it sad that I end up having conversations in my mind while I'm at his place, or texting friends for hours, instead of talking to him. For me conversations are a way to get to know each other and if someone seeks talking to me, it shows that they are interested in me and they want to know me better, which results in me feeling valued by them. Him not trying to do so makes me feel as if I'm not interesting enough to him. It's like I'm his new pet, a cute kitten to feed and give affection to, but not a human being. The way we're living seems more like ""roommates with benefits"" than an actual couple. I'm aware that this might be common among people who have been together for a long time, but we're only a few weeks in and I'm wondering what would the future hold then? I'm seriously considering whether or not continuing dating after the quarantine ends. And yes, I've tried a couple of times initiating a deeper conversation, but he didn't seem much involved and the lack of reciprocation is a big turn off for me."

My grandmother had breast cancer and had to go through a mastectomy to remove the tumor. She survived with only one breast. She was only 40-something.
25 years later she had another case of cancer, but this time it was inoperable and terminal. She died at 72, was one of the strongest people I've known, but still couldn't fight it.

Her twin sister had cervical cancer that made her physically unable to bear children. Years later it resurfaced again and she died because of it. She never became a mother, not that she had any choice in that matter anymore.

Their older sister also died of cancer after seeing them being buried in the ground at their funerals. They all died a couple of years in between. I guess they couldn't bear the pain of losing each other.

I prefer to die from paragliding or some other extreme experience than from lying in bed unable to even get up. 

I've had suicidal ideation since the age of 6, been through physical and emotional abuse all my life, been through multiple depressive episodes, felt broken from the start, have ongoing dermatillomania of 10 years that feels like addiction, recently started experiencing anxiety, have some ADD and bipolar like symptoms, yet still, I would never ever wish to have cancer!

I've always thought that depression is like cancer of the soul. I'm familiar with emotional pain. I can handle suicidal thoughts. Death by suicide is still in my power - it's my choice whether or not to commit it. And even though I've been hopeless, abused and filled with self-hatred and etc. I've always been physically healthy. Cancer doesn't ask you if you want to live or not. It just comes into your life and if it wants to kill you - it will. You can battle it as much as you want - there's still no guarantee you would survive. You can do everything you need to live, and still die. You can be willing to live with all your mighty, cancer could still cut you out of this world. I haven't tried to kill myself and maybe I'm ignorant, but in my opinion cancer is as bad as having a mental illness, but not any less. People might not understand me and my mental problems but they never do even when I'm fine, so whatever, I'm used to being alone and misunderstood. And being ill and surrounded by people who love you and want you to live, but you're not sure you'll survive is absolutely heartbreaking, you see how they're hiding their pain in front of you, you see what your condition is causing them, and you have no power over it, you can't cover it, and you're just glued to that bed seeing how people around crumble because of you - that's heartwrenching and I don't want to see this.

I'm sorry, but wishing cancer instead of mental illnesses because you think you'll be treated better is plain attention seeking, they're BOTH EQUALLY HORRIBLE conditions that shouldn't be compared at all. You don't know what you're talking about. I'd rather die of suicide that's been my conscious choice than be crushed by an illness I have no power over."

IWantToLearn,f6ncvc1,t3_drweus,1572988911.0,"Have you had any traumatic experiences recently or been through depression? I've read on other threads people share how depression has made them feel dumber and have their memory weakened. I'm not sure if there is a real correlation, but it might be true.

Is there anything that you still enjoy doing and doesn't feel like a burden? Maybe you're burned out and need a break from studying. Do you lack motivation, do you find yourself procrastinating? Do you feel as if your attention span has shrunk? You may try engaging with stuff you like, trying by little steps, to rewire your brain to assimilate new information in an approachable and pleasant way. Smartphones and endless scrolling can make our brains lazier - we only consume content, without putting much thought and effort into it, we are presented with small cuts of texts and videos, we often found ourselves unable to read or watch for longer than what we used to. The information is usually easy to comprehend, doesn't train us to think critically or creatively in any way. There are of course exceptions and the quantity matters a lot, but it might be one reason.

Another one would be improper self-care in both physical and mental aspects - lack of sleep, poor in nutrients food, lack of physical activity, obsessive thoughts, anxiety, numbness, general disinterest in life, etc.

I'm no psychologist, nor doctor, but these have been my observations over myself and other people. As someone mentioned, it might be ADHD, even though I wouldn't be quick to self-diagnose myself if I were you - what you believe of yourself could become what you are, it's important to sanitize your thoughts and be conscious of your mindset and how it affects you. Would be open to discuss it further."

Dermatillomania,ezbthbg,t3_d0qdly,1567825179.0,"I've never picked on anyone else's skin, but maybe it's because I was on the other end at the beginning - my mother was obsessed with my skin and the puberty blemishes I started to have back then, so she'd squeeze them even if I didn't want her to (it would hurt sometimes). I think this triggered my dermatillomania, I just wanted her to stop doing it to me, so I started it myself. I know from personal experience how it feels like and I can't imagine doing it to anyone else.

I don't have any other advice than try to put yourself in her shoes and imagine how awkward and irritating it can be when someone is obsessed over something on yourself that isn't a big deal for you. If you have a hard time relating with the skin picking being problematic, replace it with something else you don't care much about - like for example body hair, white hairs, split ends, nails being too long/uneven, etc. Then imagine someone else constantly checking these things on you and insisting on ""fixing"" them for you. There still must be something you won't like to be put under the spotlight. Remind yourself of this everytime you catch yourself doing it. Or ask her to remind you if you can't. This behaviour isn't healthy for either of you and you should exterminate it before it digs too deep in your mind. Ask her to help you too, and to not let you do this. Even if you get upset when she rejects your skin picking urges, try to remind yourself what you are actually inflicting on her. She doesn't deserve this and you should restrain yourself from doing it. And don't ever do it to your future children. You know now what are the potential consequences.

Best of luck!"
Grimes,ezbkk5b,t3_d0coxp,1567821713.0,"The lyrics kinda remind me of Lana Del Rey's song Ultraviolence. Lana once said in an interview that she wrote it about someone who had the need to break people before building them back up and he presented it as love. And here it's kinda similar. Grimes sings that the subject of the song can't see what she sees because they feed off hurting her - their blinded by their motives that make them entitled to use her. Then she sings about how they try to turn her into the bad guy - ""you wanna make me bad, said I like it like that"", which is pure gaslighting. Yet, still, she's begging them to open their eyes, to realise that what they do is wrong, that ""baby, it's violence"". I love even more the contrast between the morose lyrics and the light sound of the song - you might think at first it's about something beautiful, but it's in fact a disguise of something very dark. Just as the relationship she's describing.

The art cover also supports that - we see someone trying to kill someone else with a sword, but in front of the killer there's somewhat a mirror that portrays them as a demon.

Since Grimes and i_o have recorded this just a couple of months ago, it probably wasn't considered for the Miss_Anthropocene album and to me it sounds like a song about a toxic relationship. But the lyrics being vague and abstract it could easily fit in the whole climate change concept - Earth being the main character, begging the human race to stop the violence they unleash on her for years."
