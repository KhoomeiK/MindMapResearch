Supplements,fr23nwp,t3_gm00rs,1589830597.0,"The older you get, the more noise your joints can make, because some of your cartilage wears away as part of the normal aging process. Then these surfaces get a little rougher and so you get more noise as they rub against each other. As long as there is no inflammation and pain, it's just a normal thing as we get older.

When you crack your knuckles, the sound is coming from the compression of nitrogen bubbles that naturally occur in the spaces of the joints. The cracking is the sound of gas being released from the joint, an action called cavitation. The sound is not a cause for concern, unless there is associated pain/swelling/etc.

One thing I've heard though is that ""motion is lotion"" – the more you move, the more your body lubricates itself. When you’ve been sitting or lying around, fluid in the joints doesn’t move. The more active you are, the more your joints lubricate themselves."

I think TX currently has a long backlog of testing needing done for arrests made where they don't know which kind it is and can't prove what kind it is for those cases without sending it off to a lab to get tested. This has created a loophole in TX at the moment, since there is no on-site/faster way to differentiate between the two types of plant.

Hopefully their push to prohibit the retail sale of smokeable hemp products fails, and hopefully TX legalizes (or at minimum decriminalizes) sooner rather than later. Such archaic laws currently in place."

Some guided meditation apps like insight timer, headspace, calm, etc. can help too, doing even just a couple minutes worth of practice each morning when you wake up. You need to train your brain to not respond to the stimulus as strongly as it currently is, which will take practice/time, but is possible.
