todayilearned,fltkjhh,t1_fltiv4i,1585476863.0,"https://nisanyansozluk.com/?k=deniz

Sorry about not giving a source. Nişanyan's Dictionary says ""deniz"" also means, ""plains"", ""unlimited"","" equal"". He doesn't give any source about ""cengiz"". 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan#Name_and_title

Wikipedia says, there is a word ""tenggis"" in Mongol and it's probably derived from Turkic, but if ""genghis"" means ""tenggis"", why they didn't just used that word? 

By the way, Turkic ""sea"" is ""tengiz"" and there is just one different letter and that's because, they couldn't say anthing about the origin.

This may be an urban legend(khan of seas thing). That's okay, at least I and maybe you learnt the other theories. It's better than not providing any source and keep saying ""genghis is not tengiz"".

Cheers."
