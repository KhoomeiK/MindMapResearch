I got the red stretch recommended from my fysiotherapist, do one arm at the time. Stand straight, put your left arm up against a wall, take one step out with your RIGHT leg (opposite), and slowly twist your upper body towards the opposite side. Dont twist a lot, just a small twist makes a big difference. Hold for 20 seconds x 3 on each arm"

If she still refuses to open up to you (you're her closest person, you should be the one she can talk about this with) and if feels like you give and give and she has no energy to accept help then you have to put YOUR mental health first and think realistically. 

With no progress the best thing can be a break or a break up. But communication is the most important part and if she refuses that and refuses to go to a therapist alone or with you, there's nothing else you can do. You can be there for her all her life but if the relationship is not what you want it to be then you won't be happy. 

&#x200B;

todayilearned,f30lj7h,t3_df3i9o,1570557014.0,"A demo of ""Hold Up"" was first written and recorded by Diplo and Koenig in 2014, using a sample of ""Maps"" by Yeah Yeah Yeahs.[3] Koenig, the frontman for the indie rock band Vampire Weekend, had tweeted the lyrics ""hold up...they don't love u like i love u"" – interpolated from the chorus of ""Maps"" – in 2011. This tweet had confused people as the song was written in 2011 but, as he explained on Twitter, it was just a random tweet at the time.[3]

According to Koenig's interview on Beats One, the demo he and Diplo made was simple track with only chorus in it.[4] Beyonce gave this demo to various songwriters to get the best ideas, songwritings. MNEK said he wrote a full song over the demo, but Beyoncé only used 3 lines from his song, which were eventually used in the bridge.[5] he also mentioned the unique process of Beyoncé: ""The way she works, she is a writer in herself. And then she pieces together stuff and she pieces together, you know, Diplo's going to work on the track; she's going to send it to me to do a melody idea. That's the process. And it worked because she's overlooking everything""[6]

Father John Misty also said Beyoncé contacted him after she heard his song through Emile Haynie. She gave him the simple demo track and he ended up writing first verse and refrain. ""With 'Hold Up' they just sent me the beat and the hook. I wrote that first verse and the 'jealous and crazy' part."" from his interview.[7] He didn't know if his part would be used or not but later Beyoncé told him in person that his part made the final cut at his 2015 Coachella set.[8]

In the outro of the song, Beyoncé sampled the hook from ""Turn My Swag On"" by Soulja Boy. She used the first two lines of the hook twice with slow falsetto vocals to express the feeling between denial and anger.
