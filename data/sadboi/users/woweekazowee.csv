mentalhealth,fmu0voe,t3_fx2qdr,1586382504.0,"I'm not sure if I should post a trigger warning but just in case, TW: I'm about to discuss suicide 

I work in public safety in a small town. We have had more suicides in the last two weeks than we have had in the last year. I had a breakdown at my desk earlier today because I just couldn't keep up with them all. I struggle with my own mental health and I truly have no idea how to keep up with all of the death. My heart hurt so. So. Badly. For the families. Every part of me aches going into work because I KNOW there is someone in my community right now who is going to end their life and I have no idea how to find them or help them. I just have to pick up the pieces after it happens.  

If you're struggling, please, please, please seek help. Phone a friend, teladoc, anything. Please. I know this is hard right now. I honestly don't know what else to say but please do all you can to hold on for the time being. We're all in the same boat of horrible right now. We know! We understand! And we see you!!!!! PLEASE let someone try to help. I know this is impossibly hard right now. I wish I had better words for this but please just hold on as long as you can."

He did all of these things to me and I kept telling myself I was too young, setting too soon for someone to treat me terribly. I was planning on leaving him for these same reasons but was too scared, he ended up leaving me anyways. 

I've been pretty sad, but seeing this was really empowering. Reminds me that just because he was good sometimes doesnt mean he was good overall. Thank you for sharing this."
