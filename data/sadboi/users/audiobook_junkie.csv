BPD,fneydd2,t3_etqf2x,1586898113.0,"Lawd yes!  I feel like I'm acting so much that sometimes I don't think I can rely on my ability to read situations correctly.  I, too, look to others to see their reactions and modify my own to suit the situation.  I get confused so often.  I feel hollow.  I don't interact with others, even my quiet husband.  I get confused with empathy.  I guess I'm selfish, but I truly can't feel things when I should.  I said something like this to my husband, that I feel like I'm performing and he didn't take that well.  I can't explain it, but I guess he thought I acted for him."
BPD,fn0pr2y,t1_fmvrqp6,1586546416.0,"I'm glad you brought it up.  I've never asked if anyone else was like me.  I know it's bound to drive my husband crazy but he's not a high maintenance kind of guy.  We don't have to entertain each other.  He goes to bed around 11pm and I'm up all night and usually head in around 5am or 6.  We used to watch some TV together, but now all I can stand is to binge watch Ink Master for a few hours a month before I have to go back into my book.   I downloaded an Android simulator for my computer so I can play the same games on my computer that  I play on my phone.  It really helps."
BPD,fmvj5m3,t3_fxdrtm,1586418863.0,"I'm the same way.  My escape is audiobooks.  I go straight from ending one to starting a new one and if I'm indecisive as to what I want to read next, my anxiety rears up and I start books until I find a narrator I can stand and listen to that.  But, I ALSO have to be doing something with my hands.  Preferably games with numbers.  I refuse to go to bed without just falling in and going straight to sleep.  I'm pretty much a recluse.  My husband does everything.  I panic if I don't have my phone with my books on it with me all the time.  I'm afraid of the quiet.  I can't stand it and I'm lucky enough to have a spouse who tries to understand.  And I don't think this is strictly a ADHD thing.  \^\_\^"
adultsurvivors,feo9f3j,t3_epste8,1579296897.0,"Thank you for the responses... Since I'm a  borderline personality,  it makes things sooo much more difficult.  My mind never stops and there's always a revolving slide show going on that I can't shut down.  Of course it features all the horrible things I do remember.  I don't go outside unless I have a doctor appointment.  I try the grounding exercises, there's just nothing that I've tried that helps with dealing with triggers.    Thanks for the comments, if I were normal (ha!) they might help, but I'm nearly a recluse and my husband does everything outside the house."
BPD,feo8c4s,t1_fenhcuo,1579296477.0,"I do try to choose innocuous books to listen to.  This hasn't happened to me before and I've been a reader for as long as I can remember.  I steer clear of the abuse/rape types.  I'm more into the fantastical types, I suppose for escapism.  I've been in therapy my entire adult life and I'm 55.  I do the ""I'm HERE.""  ""I'm HERE NOW"" and look at my surroundings.  I also end up yelling at myself to stop it, just shut up, buy with borderline personality, that's not something that really works.  I've tried so many things... but I remember so little of what really happened for those 9 years, it's not surprising that triggers will bring back a memory so strong it feels real.  My therapist and psychiatrist really don't know what else to do.  I know that some borderlines just can't be helped.  I suppose I might fall into that group.  Thank you so much for the response, thebloodedrose.  I really appreciate it."

BPD,f3zax5e,t3_di9koh,1571265305.0,"My husband got tired of me apologizing all the time and said QUIT, so I quit.  It's HARD, and I'd say it in my head, but not out loud.  Now, if I do something I think hurt someone then I will apologize,.  My sister-in-law reads some of my texts and tells me when I'm being too kind, being too sorry for something I didn't do, taking crap and not giving it back, and basically helping me see that it's not always ME.  I have trouble being objective and tend to think everything is my fault, when logically I know it can't be.  I live far from my family and when they post things about family and family members in a not-so-kind way, I ALWAYS think they're talking about me.  :/  I hate that so much because it hurts so bad.  I've stopped asking them if that was about me.  They don't understand, nor do they try."

BPD,f2bq5fr,t3_dchyuf,1570129576.0,"I use an online psych doc.  It's great due to the ease and he and I video chat, so I won't miss an appointment with him no matter where I am.  He's basically just for my meds and very supportive.  It's nice to still have the same psych even when I move.   My husband says I NEED to tell my new doctor so they have ALL of my information.  After the great input here, I've decided not to tell them and just give a med list.  In all honesty, I think that's all they need to know.  I'll give them my Psych's name and info and they can contact him if needed, but otherwise, I'm not going to be seeing a PC doc for the same thing, so they don't need to know.  I HATE the stigma associated with BPD.  So, thank each of you for your input!  It's helped ease my nerves immensely."
BPD,f2bnfg4,t1_f28h9kr,1570128632.0,"Thank you, kittykatbox.  I've been in therapy my entire adult life.  I've been seeing an EMDR therapist for the last few years and she's helped me quite a bit.  I'm doing my best with my family.  That freakin' fear of abandonment makes me crazy.  I live 6 hours away from them so avoidance is no problem.  I talk to them and share pictures with them on FB.  I miss them and want so badly to be included in family get-togethers.  I did get a message from my niece last night.  Her daughter is moving into a large house with her bf and said I could have one of the bedrooms any time I want to come up.  That did make me feel better and gave me a smile.   


I've been looking for a DBT therapist in my area but can't find any that accepts my insurance.  :/  I'm going to keep looking because I think that type of therapy will help much more than my EMDR.  One of my biggest problems .. crap, forgot what I was going to say.  -\_-   I HATE that.  Anyway, thank you so much for your support.  I am so glad I decided to give this a try.  I'll brb if I remember what I was going to say.  rme"
BPD,f28ble1,t3_dagepq,1570057383.0,"I look back at family photos and photos of my friends and I and have absolutely no memory of those events whatsoever.  I can see in the pictures that I was there.  I just have no memory of them or the event.  It drives me nuts!  My husband says he tells me things and I would swear up and down that he did not and he just says he did and that's it.   He's very easy going and quiet.  I'm all out there.  He says I make him tired.  I have to laugh at that.  But he puts up with me and my moods and tells me that I'm stuck with him, and I tell him he's stuck with me and he smiles.  He actually smiles which flabbergasts me because I'm such a mental wreck.    


I can't remember names, faces, phone numbers, places, appointments ... etc.  I've been on Valium for YEARS and that's said to have a huge effect causing memory loss.  And I'm terrified of having Alzheimers when I get older."
