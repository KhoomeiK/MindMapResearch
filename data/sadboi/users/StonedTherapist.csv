ContagiousLaughter,foflzmc,t1_fofk89v,1587738635.0,"Right!! Something we do that helps a lot is if a topic has been on our mind that we know the other may not agree with, we usually say ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôve been thinking about X and would like to talk about it later.‚Äù That way, we both have time to think about the subject and gather all our thoughts before we sit down and discuss it like adults."

CasualConversation,f2n11hg,t1_f2kmexa,1570310617.0,Yes I like doodling and that was another big selling point of the iPad for me! Question: Do the iPad Pros in the Apple Store have MS office on them? It would help a lot to be able to see how using it works on the iPad since I‚Äôm so used to my laptop now.
BehaviorAnalysis,f2kwtez,t1_f2h6cbb,1570289950.0,"It stands for Behavior Development Solutions. It‚Äôs a set of 400 or so study modules designed to prepare you for the BCBA exam. The modules have questions similar to the exam, and some are much much harder, and you work through the acquisition modules and then do the fluency modules. It‚Äôs about $400 I think, but if you finish all modules to 100% and fail the exam, they refund your money. BDS helped me feel VERY prepared. And it was part of my capstone of my master‚Äôs program, so I was required to finish all of the modules."
BehaviorAnalysis,f2kvzw8,t1_f2gpbpj,1570289701.0,"The cool part about BDS is that if you complete every module to 100% and don‚Äôt pass the exam, they refund your money."
CasualConversation,f2jvkee,t1_f2hipnw,1570278215.0,"Thank you for your comment! I didn‚Äôt know that the Apple store held classes, I‚Äôll have to check that out and play with the iPad Pro! I was also very interested in getting the Apple Pencil. It looks so cool, but I‚Äôve never tried one before. When I looked at prices online, I think it was going to cost $1,000 for the iPad and the pencil, and $1,100 for the MacBook Air. They‚Äôre so close in price, it‚Äôs hard to decide. But I think from yours and everyone else‚Äôs comments, I‚Äôm still leaning more towards iPad. :)"
CasualConversation,f2g80ur,t1_f2g7abj,1570227578.0,"I would be pissed about it dying too! Because I have to write 50+ page documents for my clients every couple months and I don‚Äôt want to deal with that on my phone. The stuff I do on my laptop for work can all be done on a phone or tablet easily. I was leaning towards the iPad Pro because it has the 12.9‚Äù screen, I can Bluetooth connect a keyboard for when I need to type a lot, and it‚Äôs even lighter than the MacBook Air."
CasualConversation,f2g5xar,t1_f2fzu2y,1570226886.0,"Thanks for sharing! I definitely wouldn‚Äôt make the switch if it was to a 7‚Äù tablet, that‚Äôs way too small. I have definitely considered the inability to download certain apps through Apple, but I don‚Äôt think there are any apps I use on my laptop that I couldn‚Äôt get on a tablet. 

I think what prompted me to consider this switch is the fact that when I finished my Master‚Äôs and wasn‚Äôt doing schoolwork anymore, I didn‚Äôt even touch my laptop for almost 3 months. I did all of my work from my phone because it was so much quicker than using my laptop."
CasualConversation,f2fz0q3,t1_f2fy1ws,1570224525.0,"Thanks for sharing, that‚Äôs helpful! PDF and MS Office are easily the things I use the most. I searched through my laptop and the only program I was concerned about losing if I switch to iPad was Photoshop. But even that, I use only a handful of times a year. 

I can definitely see why you‚Äôd want a monitor with the 10-inch iPad. I‚Äôm thinking that I‚Äôve had a 13-inch laptop for years, so making the switch to a 12.9-inch iPad wouldn‚Äôt be too bad."
CasualConversation,f2fxecs,t1_f2fwsi5,1570223925.0,"I have to type up 50+ page documents for work, but the Bluetooth keyboard I could buy to use with a tablet would be the same size keyboard as my current laptop, so I feel like that part won‚Äôt bother me."
BehaviorAnalysis,f2fjwmk,t1_f2fjmhe,1570218861.0,"You need to know a LOT more information for the BCBA than for the RBT too. Make sure to review the task list and know every single item like the back of your hand! The BDS modules were a great study tool for me and I recommend them, but I know a lot of people who didn‚Äôt like the format, so it‚Äôs just a matter of finding what study method works for you. Also, you can request to join the Facebook group called ABA Study Group. They post practice questions and mock exams and you can ask any questions for things you might need clarification on. It‚Äôs an awesome resource! Good luck :)"
BehaviorAnalysis,f2fj12l,t3_ddc7nn,1570218457.0,"The BCBA exam is extremely difficult compared to the RBT exam. It has lengthy scenario questions where you‚Äôre asked to pick the BEST response. In some cases, all the answers could potentially seem right, but one of them is the most preferred answer. It‚Äôs very tricky! You definitely need to know your stuff inside and out."

When I find it, he always pretends he has absolutely NO idea what I‚Äôm talking about or where the duck came from or how it came to be in the bed. He tries to argue that I‚Äôm the one hiding it and blaming it on him. It‚Äôs stupid but it makes both of us laugh before we go to sleep."
