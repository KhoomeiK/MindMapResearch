depression,ffszppp,t3_euz21i,1580199464.0,I feel this on such a deep level. The fact that other people have goals and aspirations and a purpose in life is baffling to me. I have never had a set goal in life. No jobs have ever seemed appealing to me. I never went to college because it seemed like a huge waste of money to get a degree when I don‚Äôt even know what I would major in. I spend all my time alone in my room because I have no friends. I‚Äôm currently 25 and jobless. Didn‚Äôt start working until I was about 21. Worked somewhere for a year and a half or so and then found a new job because I was too bored and overwhelmed. Ended up quitting the next job after a year and a half again because the same thing happened. Having to work in a dead end job every day for the rest of my life is like a nightmare to me. I don‚Äôt want to work but I also don‚Äôt want to still be living with my parents when I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs. Depression is a major reason why I haven‚Äôt started working again but honestly I‚Äôm also a lazy fuck. It sucks dude. Depression + already being inclined to laziness is a dangerous mix. Sorry to go off on a tangent here. I just really resonated with what you said.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffp6v7l,t1_ffp6rtp,1580087721.0,I was gonna say I‚Äôm gonna assume maybe you‚Äôre not American lol. It‚Äôs definitely understandable that you wouldn‚Äôt know who he is in that case.
