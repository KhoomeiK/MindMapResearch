relationship_advice,fpzjtrh,t3_gg4e0q,1589019235.0,"this is my rule personally ""never forgive a cheating bitch.""     why should u need to lower yourself to a standard of having to be in a relationship with other people's cocksleeve/dildo (depending which gender ur dating). no, u deserve better. DON'T GIVE IN TO HER!! 

(I may be just a lol paranoid but bare with me) but also don't do anything that can get u in trouble with the court. e.g. don't push her, don't shout at her. don't do anything that she can use in court against u to say that u may be abusive or whatever else she can pull out of her pathetic fucked arse. 

try and make it very clear, no matter what she does, that u guys are OVER and u don't want anything to do with her. if u can, try to avoid her. or if u have pet, try to concentrate on their company or try to make some friends online that u can trust/ consult with. 

used cocksleeves/dlidos like her (no offense) are the worst.

edit: (sorry if this is irrelevant, I'm not trying to assume that u don't know these things but im just really do with cheaters) 

also do u guys have kids together?  if u do, u can try and fight for custody of ur kids using the evidence that she cheated on u with. if not, u have to try and find a way for her to admit that she cheated on u. because usually women get the advantage of having their kid in a divorce. 

also that cocksleeve sexually harressed u, and took advantage of u. I hope ur ok now. please please please leave her. u deserve much better, much more than just a used cocksleeve with saggy tits."

GoodGirls,fpn9mww,t3_gdod12,1588755083.0,ugh ok. I just really hope that Dean goes away. I need Beth and Rio to be together but Dean is just being ugly at the side. the toxic and confusing Beth and Rio relationship is already killing me. I don't need another extra annoying burden at the corner jeopardizing them to be together.
GoodGirls,fpn9g73,t3_gebm7u,1588754892.0,"tbh. yea same. I don't hate any of the characters. I just hate how they act so morally inclined to do the right thing.  

one of parts I hate the most, is when they didn't kill the annoying Mary Pat girl. I don't understand why they didn't want to kill her when she first demanded for the $10,000. like hun, no i work hard for this cash and I'm not giving it to u.

 sorry if I'm getting too into this show. yes I know this is just a story but it just doesn't make any sense at all that they didn't kill her. also trigger warning.

 if they killed her and asked Rio to like get rid of her or smthg. first of all, if Rio is in the organ business, uh free organs? more cash? 

secondly, this might seem abit cruel but, we're talking, ""I have no morals so I'm a gang person"" sort of situation. damn her kids can be sold for more cash. e.g organ harvesting, child labour, whatever else they do with kids. basically more cash. 

and u get her house and whatever other cash she has. if she had family, when her husband died, they probably would have helped her thru the difficult time so she probably doesnt have any. correlates to how if she went missing, no one would really bother.

they literally could have avoided the extra work but slicing that bitch open and getting the extra cash. 

I understand that at the start, she had alot of kids and a single mum and stuff and they empathize with her coz of the kids and whatever nots but later on? she was obviously going to be an issue, the issue was going to be bigger than if they had killed her, what would've happened to the kids. 

edit: sorry it's super long but im just frustrated"

JUSTNOMIL,fc8243v,t3_egdlng,1577524874.0,"awhh don't let that jealous bitch get to u, ur an amazing person, keep up the good work!! my mum actually has cancer, and is on medication, 

(she got it 2 years ago and I actually never told anyone before) 3 years ago when she stopped working, my father's mother, which was basically my grandmother, began to bitch about her and my dad behind her back, 

my mum felt very hurt because she accidentally heard in on the phone when my grandmother was talking to my 5th aunty (my home phone is connected so if someone is talking on one phone, u can hear in on their conversation on the other) 

they got into a big argument a few times but my mum thought that was it. but my grandmother began to bitch more about her, even to my aunty living overseas (in China) with her sons. and my dad didn't even defend my mother.

today we had a family gathering for my grandmother's belated birthday, when my mum and I went to the toliet, my aunty and my grandmother was there (my grandmother and my mum are on talking terms). my aunty glared at my mum

and my mum felt that something was not right, she got upset and told my dad off, saying that she didn't want them at her wake if they has no sincerity whatsoever."
