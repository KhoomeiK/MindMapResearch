depression,fgk49bq,t3_eyxt91,1580857160.0,Yup. it's like they know you have it but only expect it to play in the background. Feel like you don't want to go out bc you feel worthless? Suck it up and have some fun!
Anxiety,fgjsvpn,t3_eyrfj0,1580850741.0,"I understand this perfectly. I also feel like I have these made up rules in my head that I subconsciously follow. Sometimes I catch myself, like you said, and I'm like ""wait, no. I can do WHATEVER I want that makes me feel best. Like I have a toxic friend and shes supposed to be my bff but yesterday she casually mentioned that she tired to show her new nipple piercings to my (fresh) ex. She always did small things to me but I never mentioned it becasue I didn't want to start a fight and I didn't want to be a bitch, thanks mental illness. But yesterday with the comment about my ex. I mean no real friend would say that. So I'm gonna stay happy with my decision to BLOCK."

adultsurvivors,fg5q2y0,t3_ewy5cm,1580534825.0,"This is the first time I've ever heard someone with a similar story. I've always thought that it didn't matter if i went to therapy, it's never ending. I feel like the problem. 

I was 6 when a boy a little older than me pinned me on a table rubbed himself all over me

Then while my brother was in the hospital I was 11 and stayed with a family friend. Their son constantly made inappropriate remarks to me the whole time and recorded me changing under my door. 

A few moths later I was forced into my first kiss by a girl who hated me pulling my arms behind a large tree, leaving me defenseless to a boy who took my first kiss and hickey. 

Right after my birthday my grandfather molested me in my mothers bed while she was away at cadet camp with my brother.

At age 18 I went to the club for the first time where a guy wouldn't get off me, forcing his tongue in my mouth and my hand down his pants. Locking my head to his with his arm, I couldn't get away. 

A few moths later I got into a relationship and lost my virginity and when it hurt too much and I wanted to stop I was greeted with ""It's going to hurt at first"" and pressured into a second round in a more painful position because it felt god for him. 

Not having a choice. If he's horny, I'm having sex. 

And I know there's so many more experiences to come. These kinds of things we just have to be aware of as women. As much as we all fucking hate the statistic of 1/3, it's nice to see. Thank you for sharing with me, this is very significant for me. <3"

Mourning - Didn't have enough conflict for me, couldn't relate to it too well

Codeine Dream - captured my soul, a whole genre in itself omg im in love

Everythings a ceiling - a work of art im so glad I know exists, I have to play this on my uke

Before it Breaks - almost got me, beautiful. perfectly mixed too. ugh incredible. That was so close 

Cold day in july - trusting....wow so so so good, loved that song!

The District Sleeps - I understand it but it's not for me

Molly - A classic that I haven't heard in a while and I'm glad I heard it again 10/10

World In Flames - yeah this one was 5 mins long and i didn't enjoy the beginning so i passed...

Fade - Love the beat going on 

Xerces - don't do me like that :(

Sea Fog - Honestly a nice song to even end this little demo playlist, a realistic pov. But I did love this one a lot, more zoned out than wanting to cry. still a major vibe though."

A place where I could vent and get feedback and not feel so alone. I've half typed out my baggage many times and when I get too tired of writing and look at all the work, I delete it. Who cares about what I went through. Nobody is going to see or read it. But I'd never feel that way about anybody else's story, so why do I put myself through that shame? Anyways, loved the thought in your post. Thank you. <3"
