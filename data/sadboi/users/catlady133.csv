Anxiety,fqzkxuf,t1_fqz742q,1589769553.0,"Yep :C.. I really hate the physical symptoms because it starts the vicious cycle of questioning/wondering why it‚Äôs happening. I spoke to my therapist about this and tried to tell her that I don‚Äôt find myself having any bad thoughts in a given moment but my physical symptoms will come on and that scares me - which leads to the bad thoughts. She says I could be thinking about something subconsciously that triggered the physical symptoms. I try not to question it anymore because I‚Äôll drive myself mad. One night I was just hanging out with my family having fun and I was having too much fun that my brain just went ‚Äúwait, what about your anxiety did you forget?‚Äù And the physical symptoms just came on instantly. I do this thing where I squeeze my fists as tight as I can for 5 seconds and let go when I have the physical symptoms. I‚Äôll keep repeating it until I feel ok."
Anxiety,fqyxti1,t3_glpd9k,1589756411.0,Yeah it happens :( it‚Äôs because so much of our internal energy is just being burned off while we are in that fight or flight state of anxiety. It really sucks. I get a lot of intrusive thoughts that drive me insane and I have a lot of physical symptoms from anxiety that leave me exhausted. I just feel so tired and drained even though I haven‚Äôt done much
acne,fqbvjke,t3_ggpmvw,1589244753.0,"It‚Äôs similar for me too :( my left side is ok but my right side gets frequent inflammation. I‚Äôve stopped wearing makeup since being in quarantine and I‚Äôve noticed improvement. I also don‚Äôt moisturize all over my face because my skin is so sensitive I get breakouts as soon as I moisturize it‚Äôs awful. I don‚Äôt use creams with oil. I‚Äôve been using a gel cream from olehenrikson. Also picking doesn‚Äôt help :( but sometimes I get so down and pick my skin ugh. When I have scarring I use a vitamin C serum from olehenrikson as well. I‚Äôve been taking vitamin c+zinc tablets as well. I also started drinking 2000ml water a day and cut out sugar/sweets/dairy. I‚Äôve heard sunscreen helps a lot, I‚Äôm still looking for a decent one though. I also change pillow cases frequently and try to cover my hair at night so it doesn‚Äôt get all over my face when I sleep."
Anxiety,fpu50o7,t3_gfk3x4,1588904801.0,"Are you home with anyone? Stay calm, call a family member or friend to be with you. They can monitor you, while you reach out for help."
Anxiety,fpu4k79,t3_gfeqbl,1588904521.0,"I‚Äôm also very very sweaty, since I was a kid. It used to just be my armpits and then as I got into my late 20s my palms and feet started sweating too. I feel your pain, I avoid all light coloured clothing, I wear black or lots of loose clothing so my sweat from my armpits can just roll down my side fat onto my waistüò≠üò≠üò≠. Sigh. I use degree men‚Äôs deodorant but I‚Äôm a female. Baby powder for the feet helps too."
Anxiety,fpu3rvf,t3_gf03w6,1588904036.0,"I think if you‚Äôre already experiencing anxiety/panic in the moment, definitely do not go in for a hit. I started smoking last year around this time. I can‚Äôt say I always enjoyed it tbh. Sometimes I felt super anxious or my body just felt weird. Other times I enjoyed it a lot and I was laughing/happy/bubbly. I think it really depends on your state of mind. As someone who already suffers from anxiety, I never smoked alone - always made sure someone safe was there for me. I didn‚Äôt do more than I could handle. But I stopped completely in April this year because I had two panic attacks when I used it while I was on SSRIs. It was really awful panic - heart racing, sweating, chills, fever etc. I‚Äôve hand random/exaggerated anxiety after that incident more so than I use to in the past. It is mind altering depending on your predisposition, so always be cautious of what you put into your body."
Anxiety,fpu2ew8,t3_gf7ars,1588903215.0,"I‚Äôve had lots of issues like this when my anxiety comes on. Lots of times I‚Äôll be eating and I just get a lump in my throat and sometimes I find it so hard to swallow. Appetite completely gone and I just throw my food away. I feel completely nauseous and sick to my stomach. I haven‚Äôt found a work around it yet. BUT I noticed that sugary foods can bring on my anxiety a lot worse - the sugar rush and crash really magnifies my physical symptoms. When I wake up in the morning I drink lots of water and prep myself to eat soft foods that do NOT require lots of chewing - bananas, avocados etc. SOUP becomes your bestfriend. Stay away from caffeine and high sugar it makes you feel absolutely worse on an empty stomach. I once drank green tea and ate 10 Timbits (I‚Äôm in Canada) in one sitting and within an hour I was nauseous, feeling dread/fear and that weird sinking feeling in my tummy. When we‚Äôre having anxiety we go into fight or flight mode so bodily functions like digestion is slowed down so our energy can be redirected to face/focus on our perceived threat/fear sigh."
Anxiety,fpl5y49,t3_ge0gcl,1588706953.0,Do you have access to therapy? Or even a support line? I know it sounds corny.. but the support lines actually really help..
Anxiety,fpl5rpp,t3_ge0j59,1588706864.0,"I feel for you.. it can be extremely uncomfortable. I‚Äôve always hated with a passion having to sleep over around other people. I have lots of rigid routines and structure - so being around others and breaking my routines makes me feel completely BLAH. What I would recommend, if you‚Äôre able to is wake up earlier than everyone else so you have first access to the washroom.. I hope that helps a little.. Also when you‚Äôre having anxiety/panic I would recommend some muscle tension exercises, it helps me come back to the present. I squeeze my eyes as tight as I can for 5 seconds, then relax it and repeat to myself the word ‚Äúcalm.‚Äù Then I‚Äôll squeeze my fists for 5 seconds.. so on so forth for each body part. I hope you get through this"
Anxiety,fpl50tq,t3_ge14dl,1588706485.0,"You can do it !! I‚Äôve been stuck in quarantine and dealing with anxiety as well. It was not easy finding a therapist, but please give it a shot. The therapists are very structured and it‚Äôs not simply you throwing things out there randomly. They take it very easy and slow. I cried the first time I went to therapy because I was expressing everything, but it felt so damn good to let it out! Also, when I get my therapy calls, I step out to my backyard and just act like I‚Äôm getting fresh air. You can just pretend you‚Äôre stepping out to talk to your fianc√© maybe? Sending lots of support your way !!"
Anxiety,fpl4a2w,t3_ge39nv,1588706104.0,"You can get through it! If this person is a true friend.. they will understand what‚Äôs going on with your mental health and the state you‚Äôre in right now. It may make your friend sad, but true friends will understand. Sending lots of courage and strength your way! I also get defensive when my bf tells me how much potential I have and what I‚Äôm capable of doing.. I always find some sort of self doubt, fear or reason why I‚Äôm not deserving or capable of achieving something. Your friend might being telling you all those things to do cause he wants to uplift you, but it‚Äôs overwhelming for you and he may not know that, so you should let him know."
Anxiety,fpl3k41,t3_gdwcei,1588705741.0,Yes I do get this! I can‚Äôt stand the sound of people talking or just any noise irritates me and exaggerates whatever anxiety symptoms I‚Äôm having in the moment - like that weird feeling in my tummy and feeling dread. I usually just feel the urge to get away and leave.
Anxiety,fpkhi3m,t3_gdr9li,1588694790.0,Yeah I think that happens to me. Or I look like I‚Äôm zoned out/in deep thought. My bf has told me this and called me out on it. If we have disagreements/problems or I have my own problems that are making me anxious I tend to zone out/look away avoid eye contact because I‚Äôm in my head going over everything constantly.
Anxiety,fpkf5hd,t1_fph7fhx,1588693559.0,"I don‚Äôt drink any caffeine at all I get horrible jitters. I made the mistake once of ordering a drink from Starbucks not realizing it had caffeine in it and I felt so sick after. It was the mango dragon fruit drink lol. I was on SSRIs but I only lasted 4 days, the side effects were too horrible ! I felt like a zombie. I did smoke occasionally sativa or cbd only, but my anxiety got worse in April and I just stopped everything. I was on Ativan before, but now I‚Äôm paranoid about my health and that ingesting meds is making my anxiety worse sigh. I‚Äôll try the dove anti-stain! Thanks for the tip. I‚Äôve also used baby powder in my palms and on my feet. Do you use any meds?"
Anxiety,fpgs7zj,t3_gddtw6,1588608564.0,"My boyfriend sent me to buy Yukon gold potatoes and I went in circles for 25 minutes checking the potatoes section over and over. I even asked employees which one were the Yukon gold potatoes because it wasn‚Äôt marked on the bag. I don‚Äôt cook and I‚Äôm not very good at it. I was sweating the whole time, freaking out looking for the potatoes in the grocery store."
Anxiety,fpgr303,t1_fpesh9q,1588607967.0,"Yeah ! It could be the social setting or fear of not knowing how to escape. I was getting my teeth cleaned once and the dentist told me before she started that I can tell her to stop. I was to fearful to tell her stop bc of anxiety so I just endured everything. I had the sweating since I was a child, I could just be having a regular convo and the sweating just happens ugh. As a child I never wore T-shirts or tight fitting clothes because of disgusting armpit stains or fear of it showing. Now as an adult, I‚Äôm 26 going on 27, it‚Äôs not only my armpits sweating, but my hands and feet sigh"
Anxiety,fpeqwrq,t3_gczqv2,1588553033.0,I sweat all the time from my anxiety üò≠
Anxiety,fpe3miq,t3_gcu55x,1588539687.0,"I was an anxious person before weed, but I was a functioning person even with the anxiety. I also had lots of distractions prior to quarantine - regular job/friends etc. When I did smoke it was only with my bf always around bc I felt safe. There were times I did get anxiety from it and other times I felt good. It really does depend on your state of mind before you take a hit. I recently had some really bad panic attacks around the beginning of April when I started an SSRI. On the third day of my SSRI I felt a bit better and said what the heck I‚Äôll smoke. I used light stuff just mainly CBD based. But that‚Äôs where things got ugly. I had intense panic that day which came in waves. Racing heart, sweating, chills, fever - you name it. It lasted for like 28 hours. I stopped the SSRI, I stopped the weed. I took Ativan 0.5mg for like 3 days 2 weeks later, but I was fearful of taking medicine after or putting things into my body because of the experience I had with weed and the SSRI. I stopped the Ativan too bc I was fearful it would trigger more anxiety. I don‚Äôt use anything right now for the anxiety, just mindful practices and exercise. Some days it helps, some days it doesn‚Äôt. But I do feel that what happened to me in early April triggered something cause I have more physical symptoms of anxiety that I‚Äôm more aware of now than I was prior to the weed/SSRI mix. Mind you, not everyone is the same some ppl love and feel great when they mix their SSRI with weed. I was just in the early stages and wasn‚Äôt even adapted to my meds yet. I pretty much just screwed myself over lol"
Anxiety,fpd4qga,t3_gcjofz,1588519798.0,"I feel you. It has got a lot worse for me too especially during the whole quarantine thing. Before I had routine and structure. Go to my job, hang out with pals after work etc. No time to focus on bad thoughts or weird bodily sensations that my anxiety brings on. It gets worse at night before sleep and also in the AM as soon as I wake up. Last night I talked myself out of it by literally saying positive things to myself and rationalizing what I was experiencing. I told myself the bodily symptoms are nothing to panic about. I get dry throat A LOT when my anxiety hits. I start talking to myself saying to myself how normal/fine I was before being trapped at home and how this will pass. Talking to myself out loud helps more than talking to myself in my head. It helps me to hear myself! Also forcing myself to get up and doing something physical helps. Like a work out or just moving around. It‚Äôs been hard for me though because I don‚Äôt really share this stuff with family or friends, just a therapist. I‚Äôm new to reddit too. I thought I could come somewhere to relate to others and just know there are others experiencing it and I‚Äôm not alone."
Anxiety,fpd3ny2,t3_gclb2x,1588519157.0,YES! NEEDED THIS TODAY
Anxiety,fpaywxv,t3_gcdc8a,1588458606.0,More so now than ever. I always have to tell myself calm down and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm normal.‚Äù It‚Äôs been a bit worse now being stuck inside cause I‚Äôm so isolated. Really hate my anxiety.
Anxiety,fpabi5y,t3_gc8saq,1588444720.0,"This happened to me a few times over the past 2 months. When I left work after a very stressful day, I was walking home, blinked, and I was swaying to the side into oncoming traffic! Be careful and check with your doctor. I do have anxiety, but also low iron. It could‚Äôve been a combination of both."
Anxiety,fp9yy20,t1_foyt9bt,1588437446.0,"You described everything I‚Äôve been feeling! I honestly didn‚Äôt know how to put into words my physical symptoms, but you‚Äôre spot on. It‚Äôs also been the same for me where my physical symptoms have got a lot worse. In the past I felt that I had a lot more distractions OR I simply chose to ignore my physical symptoms. Now with the virus and staying home, I have no choice but to pay attention to every thought and every twitch happening in my body. The heart racing is by far the worse. I‚Äôm always trying to find out if it‚Äôs my thoughts that cause my bodily symptoms or if it‚Äôs my bodily symptoms that cause my racing thoughts after because I‚Äôm in fear of the way my body is behaving. Ugh. It‚Äôs just awful. I couldn‚Äôt stomach lexapro or any other SSRIs I was prescribed. I only lasted 3-4 days before quitting. I take Ativan for my intense panic attacks - even though it‚Äôs not for long term use sigh. I tend to get worse on meds because I fear for my health and I have anxiety about the meds making me more anxious or ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù It really is just a double whammy for me. I‚Äôm awaiting a psychiatric evaluation. My anxiety wasn‚Äôt always this severe however, I‚Äôve always had it as a child but I was functioning with it as an adult. It kind of just worse because I never addressed it I guess.."
Anxiety,fp9xooh,t1_foyqk0w,1588436705.0,"Wow.. I feel the same way. I get a weird feeling coursing through my body. Sometimes it feels like a rush. I‚Äôll get super warm or cold sweat sometimes. Only when I travel away, go on vacation am I temporarily relieved."
