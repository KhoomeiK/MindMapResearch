Democrats push for equal rights and fair treatment while republicans consistently push to take away rights and benefit the ultra wealthy. It’s literally what each party stands for. I never claimed they were 100% honest, but you don’t have an entire political party voting to give women the death penalty or life in prison for having an abortion either. That’s literally a republican thing. 

Even right now with the current state of things democrats are pushing for bailing out the working class citizens while Republicans are only worried about bailing out their already rich corporations and investors. They don’t give a shit about the average American. Obviously there’s a few exceptions such as mitt Romney and ted Cruz who’s trying to help the middle class. Mitch McConnell is the devil incarnate.
