Here are some other perspectives:

“Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” ― Hippocrates

“We do not live to eat, but eat to live.” ― Socrates

Acknowledge that companies are putting out ""foods"" with shitty ingredients in them that are literally not good for you. How  does that make you feel? Doesn't that piss you the fuck off? Fuck them and their whatever-the-fuck-they're selling and getting rich off of while putting people onto unhealthy habits.

Think about adopting an identity-based goal rather than appearance-based or whatever else. So in this case, it's ""I want to be healthier"" vs ""I want to lose weight"". Use that for whatever else you may want to do that you can apply to it. Now, as for junk foods, what may help is first starting by finding an alternative snack to eat, something healthy. Then if quantity is the problem, ween yourself toward consuming less calories; when you get the urge, do another activity *that you enjoy*. In the moment recall what you've come to realize about balance, and then do another behavior. Have that behavior in mind from beforehand (prob necessary). Try journalling, or reading, or something you can do for just 5 minutes while you let that urge pass, and then go on to whatever you would've done after you ate the junk food.

No. I already know my stance on Republicans. I know there are also conservatives who are aware of the corruption of both Democratic and Republican Parties (the fact a lot of them think Trump is any different is another story).
