I'm really thinking about backing out of this challenge, but I know my students are watching the GRIT&INTEGRITY youtube show and routing for me.  Flying just seems so scary because there is so much I don't understand about the process."

I am a teacher who is making a documentary for my students about facing fears on youtube called GRIT&INTEGRITY.  I had created a FEARLIST where I face my biggest fears, and now it's time to tackle  a huge one... SPIDERS.  I've always  heard that spiders are peaceful.  Any advice you can give me so I won’t back out?"
