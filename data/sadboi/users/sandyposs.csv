unpopularopinion,fpfw3ma,t1_fodzdb3,1588585722.0,"My husband is the youngest sibling with an older brother who has a rare chromosomal deletion. The older brother has grown up to be surprisingly highly functioning and mature, but definitely took a long time to become so, and my husband was always required to be far more of a grown up than was appropriate for his age to help out with his older brother. He was always the carer, the one helping others with their problems while not taking up anyone's valuable time with his own problems, the one who can't afford to make a fuss because he would deplete his parents' emotional energy, which was a precious resource that needed to be directed to his brother's high care needs. He grew up with this programming so encoded in him that he became a doormat, a yes-man, a mule for any and all who needed a favour. He learned to swallow his feelings and put himself last in everything, feeling it was his duty to count his own wellbeing as the lowest priority. Over many, many years with a lot of help he's started to fight that programming and recognise his own worth, but he's never completely shaken off the deeply rooted psychological tumors that resulted from his earliest upbringing. This is not to shit on his brother's existence, because we both love him very much and are so proud of the man he's become, but it does need to be acknowledged that there is a terrible toll it takes on a person's life to be the younger sibling of a high-care special needs child, and to have to 'be the bigger person' and learn to never ever cause a fuss by age five."

I deeply bonded with them but my parents really regretted them when they realised how much work was involved in maintaining them, but it was too late and so they stayed. Over the years as my ferrets and I were growing up, I couldn't help but notice and be distressed by their living conditions (kept outside in a VERY filthy cage always), but was too young to do all the maintenance myself, and couldn't persuade my folks to let them live inside or clean their cage more often, so I would just play with them outside and try to push down the guilt and worry about their quality of life for years. Many years later, long after their lives, my adult life has been plagued with years of recurring bad dreams about finding my old ferrets dead or nearly dead in state of extreme horrifying neglect.
