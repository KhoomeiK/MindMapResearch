mentalhealth,fpb1ig0,t3_gcf25x,1588460140.0,"Dayumm, I feel like I'm kinda in the same situation. I'm 20 and dropping out of uni because I just can't do it anymore. I feel stupid because I couldn't study and I was anxious most of the time. I've wanted to apply to a job since forever, but I feel so incompetent, who would ever want my non-existing skills right?  

So from one stuck person to another, I get it and sometimes I really hate and absolutely loathe myself, but I'm also trying to be positive and it's fleeting but it's there, a little.

Try not to be so hard on yourself. You girl, are 20. You're still young. You can still make something of yourself and if you need time to figure that out, it's fine. Also, I try to tell myself that failing is okay. You need to fail in order to learn something and to get better. Experience, good and bad, builds your character. Every mistake you make, every time you fall, every time you struggle; there is a lesson to be learned. The wisdom you gain through life can show you what living means, or what you want it to be for you personally. If you have to struggle through all of this mud to see clearly, then perhaps all of this right now is necessary. 

Right now you may not see it, but in the future it may occur to you that this path is one you had to take in order to become a better version of yourself. 

You may think this is utter bs and I would think so too if right now I wouldn't be this optimistic. Yet I'm trying to beat this into my brain, so I don't feel so bad if, or rather *when* I fail, because I definitely will. I just hope that I will bear my embarrassment like a badge of honor."
mentalhealth,fpaxpm6,t3_gccj17,1588457884.0,"I feel like I can relate to the ""can't"" but in my case case it's driven by fear. There's something I have to do, something I have to accomplish, but I have that crippling feeling of ""can't"" whenever I think about it. Honestly, it makes me want to cry most of the time, because I feel so powerless and stupid and pathetic. 

I didn't think anyone could understand this. Perhaps it's the same feeling you're describing. It's almost like those specific parts in the brain aren't connecting and you just fail to do whatever it is you need to do, even though it makes utterly no sense. Of course, physically, it's possible but you just ""can't"". 

I don't know if you could identify with that, but perhaps look into depression or maybe executive dysfunction."
mentalhealth,foqfdcv,t3_g8zgdw,1587992238.0,"I feel like this was me when I was 14 years old. I guess I was nostalgic, sensitive, emotional and scared. Now though, I am just scared and angry and pretty much clueless about everything in life. 

Time's moving too fast for me, because I stopped walking the moment I was out of high school. I guess I made the wrong choices and now I'm stuck. 

The most scary thing is that time won't stop. It won't wait for anyone. I can't describe the desperation and hopelessness at seeing the opportunities slip through my fingers, only because I fail to act on my behalf. And then everything catches up to me and comes crashing down only because I was too slow."
mentalhealth,fntt2t3,t3_g3orfw,1587248106.0,"Yes, for more than a year I've been feeling exactly like that and it sucks"
offmychest,fmd0a3m,t3_fuhwhs,1585956509.0,"It's the desperation and hopelessness that come with procrastination. I have a lot of experience with that it always ended up in panic crying and self-loathing really. Once you are in that line of thinking it's almost impossible to get out. It's a rabbit hole that is way too deep to explore in one day, so it goes on and on. I don't know if you are on a tight schedule, but I suggest you stay positive and tell yourself that you can do it. Don't work on two things at once, do one assignment at a time. If you have to abandon one task for the other then do it. Better do one than do nothing because the stress got too much. 
Listen to epic uplifting music if that helps to motivate you. Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fmcxikt,t3_fuhzoh,1585954842.0,"I've had that before, like moments of explosive anger and frustration but that was at a time where I already was mentally and emotionally stressed. I was sad, then I felt nothing, then I absolutely hated myself and at the smallest mistakes and failures I would look to the nearest knife or scissor and imagine stabbing myself with that. 

And since we live in trying times, I looked it up and came to the conclusion that I *may* have had a depressive episode. Sometimes depression hides itself in anger. Sometimes it hides in frustration and lashing out on others for trivial reasons. 

I don't know you, but perhaps you're tired. Maybe you need a break and not pile up stress on top of stress."
mentalhealth,fmcsj75,t3_fu8vz4,1585951970.0,"I feel like physical abuse in Asian societies is seen as a measure to discipline. Not talking about domestic abuse because someone was drunk, but it seems that if there is a legitimate reason (a child acting out, being rude, being mean, being hardheaded) it is ""okay"" to hit a child to discipline them and put them in their place. However, I do not condone such behavior and it is a reflection of bad parenting and severe lack of patience. 

And I don't care if the parent is stressed. You wanted a child, so grow a pair and take responsibility to nurture a decent human being. I'm not going to tell  where I live, but perhaps if I were raised differently I wouldn't be such a fuck up. And yes, perhaps I'm putting too much responsibility on parenting even though I am an adult now, but 50% I blame on them. 50% is on me, because OBVIOUSLY not everyone ends up like me, thank god, it's just....I feel like helping me build just *a little* self-esteem instead of making me feel like I'm nothing but a machine would have gone a looong way. 

Also, I don't trust myself with rude kids. Don't let me go to a gathering with kids that are plain rude and obnoxious because I can't trust my own hand to not slip. I've never hit a kid before and I don't ever want to, but it's definitely one of my fears, because I think I have unwittingly inherited the patience of my parents. My relationship with them isn't the best and I can't honestly trust them. 

Ok whoa, this ended in a rant, but yeah that's how I see it. So Asian societies excusing abusive parents is definitely wrong."
mentalhealth,fmcpfa8,t3_fu9a5z,1585950189.0,"Perhaps you associate your name with something bad or whenever you expect something bad to happen or to be scolded. Honestly, you just made me realize that it's the same with me. Whenever my dad calls my name, I always get annoyed because I know he wans me to do something for him. And whenever my sibling says my name, I'm always on alert because I don't know what the hell they're going to ask or say and they are the kind to drop a bomb right then and there. 

So maybe, somewhere along the line, you may have started to associate your name with something negative. Or did you do something you feel guilty about? Do you have a secret you are afraid it could be revealed? What about your self-esteem? Do you think people might talk behind your back? 

I suggest you dig around a little. Perhaps the answer is somewhere in your head."
mentalhealth,fmcnkv2,t3_fucca7,1585949132.0,"Oh man, I relate to this 100%. It's the worst when you have that one tiny glimmer of hope, that MAYBE, you *can* do something, that perhaps you are able to accomplish something on your own and then it all goes to shit because you simply cannot go all the way. 

It's like mentally hitting a wall at every corner, but all the people around you are walking by, doing their thing, while you are slowly left behind.  

And one of the worst things is, knowing it's your own damn fault and being afraid that if this is how your brain works, then you're going to be damned your whole life. 

Sometimes, I feel like I should perhaps go through life trying out different stuff and if nothing pans out, then there's always going to be the option to self-destruct. But I don't think I can. And all the things that go on in my head are so time consuming that I forget just how fast the days pass by. I myself have wasted two years and I still don't know what to do. So sadly, I can't you give you any advice. Also, I know better. People like us don't find enlightenment through what others tell us, we have to find it and experience it ourselves. 

Perhaps you should consider therapy if you haven't thought about it before. I know I this is no help at all, but know that you're not the only one hating yourself for the way your mind and body works."
mentalhealth,fm97tr3,t1_fm8ree8,1585863360.0,Thanks dude. I wish you luck as well.
mentalhealth,flvww2u,t3_frc81z,1585534031.0,"Try to talk to your parents. It wouldn't be good for your brother to be kicked out when he is already in a bad head space. 

Even if he doesn't want to talk, be there. And if he wants to talk about whatever, be there too. Even if it seems trivial, show him that you're there and that you care. People who are suicidal shouldn't be alone. I believe, it's the moment when others give up, that they feel they should give up on themselves too, because they're not worth it. Because they're a burden. So even if you can't give him any advice, even if you can't help him in difficult times, just be present. 

Sometimes, it helps to have someone there to listen without judgement or giving advice when not asked for. 

I wish you and your brother well."
mentalhealth,flvo9ju,t3_frfu7l,1585528253.0,"I don't know about mental illness, but it's definitely a ""bad"" coping mechanism. Harming yourself isn't seen as appropriate in any way or form."
mentalhealth,flvhnyi,t3_fremob,1585524023.0,You were molested as a child. Period. That alone prompts a visit to a psychologist. I hope you do seek out professional help. Be well and safe.

mentalhealth,fllwx0q,t3_fplncz,1585269475.0,Yes and the worst thing is I can't rewire my brain to think differently. This competitiveness is so ingrained in our society that it makes it impossible for me *not* to compare myself to my peers. It's almost a curse for me to be self-aware and be conscious of my own position in life.
mentalhealth,flbwwul,t3_fnuvqr,1585014507.0,"Depression perhaps? I hard to tell and obviously I'm far from qualified to make a diagnosis, but it's the response I have gotten to my situation and I feel like I'm as unmotivated to live my life as you are.

I don't think you're a bad person or something like that. You might simply be indifferent. That doesn't make you manipulative. I don't know your behavioral patterns, but perhaps you are a tad self-destructive. You might find yourself fitting into that description. Maybe you're anxious and you fear failure. I suggest you try to dig deep and turn inward to see what your true thoughts and feelings are. And even if you think that you can't trust yourself, I believe there has to be some truth somewhere in they way you act. 

Also, you're already mentioned that you're afraid of rejection. So is it self worth and confidence you're lacking? Does the thought of being left alone and completely rejected scare the heck out of you? Do you think you're not enough? Do you think you were neglected as a child? 

I think it's worth it to let your mind roam around these questions for a little. Do remind yourself, that nothing is entirely your fault. After all, you were raised by your parents and whatever they did, they had a hand in your development to the present ""you""."
offmychest,flabwsv,t3_fnjnwk,1584980813.0,"Oh goddamn, I know how that feels. I had friends unknowingly imply that I'm weak because I should just change the way I think and be happier. It's bad when they compare themselves to you and say ""I know how you feel"". Even if they did, it's even worse because they say that to you and they look like they have their shit together. In the moment, it's not the best thing to do. Talk about invalidating someone's feelings and experience. It's beating someone down when they're already at the bottom."
mentalhealth,fla9ig5,t3_fn6fjq,1584979443.0,"I've done that before and failed spectacularly several times. The only thing I can say is to not let yourself get lost in the thoughts, because if you do, you know you will not get out. It will consume you and time will pass you by at lightspeed. Don't fall prey into panic. Tell yourself that you can do it. That you will pull yourself together and you will make the best out of the remaining time before the deadline is up. 

Don't procrastinate. Do it now. You know you have to, and after that you can rest. It's going to be okay. Take small steps. Listen to some epic music if that helps, but focus. I believe in you and good luck!"
mentalhealth,fla7v7l,t3_fnkeka,1584978490.0,"I think calling it ""preventing mental disorder"" and describing it that way does seem a little weird and obsessive, perhaps even aggressive if you consider ""forcing"" kids into any kind of mental illness. 

I don't think parents always do the right thing. Some can be overbearing in their need to ""care"" for their children and some are simply misinformed. I believe it's always good to have help systems in place, all the campaigns etc, but as a setting you can voluntarily go to. Also, we should be able to trust the professionals to make the right diagnosis. 

Of course teens have it rough, but they should be given the opportunity (in the first place) AND the choice to seek out help. There are different ways you can look at ""preventing"" mental disorders, because if you actually raise children right, they should come out as decent adults. Before parents rush to label their children as mentally ill, they should take a look at the aspects of their life where a little more attention and care is due.
But even if a professional is sought out, they should be able to know then, what the child is lacking."
mentalhealth,fla431w,t1_fla3hv9,1584976188.0,Sure. You can pm me anytime.
mentalhealth,fl9zkhz,t1_fl9xowm,1584973268.0,"Have you looked at therapists in particular? Clicked on their websites perhaps and read their job specification? If yes, good job, if not, don't worry too much. The websites just have the details you might want to know, concerning cost coverage und therapy sessions, how all of that stuff works. You don't have to make an appointment right away. No need to panic, you're simply informing yourself about the specifics. I suggest you do that when you're in the right mind set. Or you can pretend that you're not doing it for yourself but for a good friend who needs help. Like I'm doing it right now. I'm reading up on stuff, because I saw your post, but I wouldn't have done it for myself. My heart is pounding right now, but small steps. Personally, I've come farther than last time I checked. If you want, you can pm me and I could look for you after I've calmed down a bit if you want a second opinion."

mentalhealth,fl9wuq1,t1_fl9uht1,1584971381.0,">my sister was for a brief moment in therapy

Did your parents make an appointment? Maybe you could also ask them to help out if you have a good relationship and if you're comfortable enough."
mentalhealth,fl9tyhc,t3_fnh7dz,1584969194.0,"Damn, I feel like I have the same problem. A part of me wants help and it takes a certain mindset or a fleeting second of courage to search the internet for options, but then I get so scared and my hope kinda plummets.

It wasn't so long ago, someone suggested to me to see a therapist, but they blatantly shoved that information down my throat, I felt rather mad at having been ""guilt-tripped"" than thankful. At least, that's how it felt for me. 

I know that they just wanted to help and I think a lot of people do, but they just don't know how exactly to touch on the subject the ""right"" way. Or perhaps, the people you confided in didn't quite grasp the seriousness of your situation. If you haven't done that maybe it's time for a serious talk about what you need help with. 

For example, perhaps it would be helpful to simply have someone else (boyfriend, or a good friend) sit next to you while you look for therapy options. Or they could look *for* you if you're too anxious to do it. 

I don't know how informed you are, but what I've read is that your health insurance covers your therapist and your sessions as long as it fits the guidelines for  mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, eating disorder, personality disorder, addiction, behavior disorder, ocd etc. You will have to undergo a physical examination to rule out any physical issues and then have consultation hours with a psychologist first before applying for insurance coverage (if needed).

You can also visit your health insurance website and look for therapists in your area. The hardest part would be making an appointment and showing up. That final step is up to you. If you can do that, then you have more grit than I do."
mentalhealth,fk8t87g,t1_fk7cg82,1583962470.0,"And there's nothing wrong with that. Or it at least it shouldn't be. If someone is tired, they should rest right? I don't know how productive that is, but the dark cloud might pass. The weight can become just a little bit lighter, even if things aren't necessarily  good. Things can become less bad I believe and that's when we can take the chance to crawl forward. Maybe it's nothing big, maybe it takes a long time, but there should be something we can do. Not because someone expects it from us, but because we want it for ourselves."
mentalhealth,fk5hjzz,t3_fgkgcp,1583880632.0,"On some level I can relate to this frustration of being stuck. I hate myself for it. I hate my own inability. I hate my own fear. I hate how my brain can't seem to function like a normal responsible adult. If only everything could just stop. If only there was a pause button. But there isn't and it makes me so so angry sometimes. 

It's so hard to act like you have it together, that the facade isn't about to break under the pressure, that your own future can become memory. 

I'm sorry I can't help and sadly, I cannot give you any good advice but I understand. You're having a tough time right now and you might feel helpless and without light right now, but you've been keeping up a long and hard fight. You're probably tired of arguing in your head. You're probably tired of going around in circles. You're probably tired of being here, but YOU ARE ALIVE. Let someone help. Reach out for help. If possible, talk to a professional. They always say that you don't have to do it alone. And you don't. I have yet to do it myself, but I think when you're at the end of your rope, one could at least give it a try."
mentalhealth,fia3357,t1_fi9rm49,1582291678.0,Yeah there really is no good way out of this. It's really not nice being stuck in between wanting to disappear and not being able to escape. It's exhausting isn't it.

It's just that I have to somehow help myself without having the tools available and no one is going to hold my hand through this stage of my life.

However, as someone who doesn't want any help, I understand your fear. Personally, I try to be there for others and I can try to be optimistic about their problems, but when it comes to myself I really can't find anything good to say.

What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter at what stage you are, not necessarily.

Plans or no plans. You're still in pain and that matters."
