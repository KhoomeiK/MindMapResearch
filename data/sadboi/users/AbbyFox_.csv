Yesterday I couldn't stop thinking about death, and today I haven't thought about it at all until now (late at night in bed.) Part of me is feeling happy but the other, smaller part of me feels like he's ensuring that I can't die off, I need to stay and take care of him. I never want to see him as a burden, he's a sweet boy and I'm already very attached to him but I'm afraid of how I'll feel in the long run..."

SuicideWatch,ev8gn5u,t3_cilc1q,1564279008.0,"Create something. Find a hobby, and use that hobby to make something. It can be something simple. Maybe pick up an instrument, and try to come up with your own tune. take a shot at drawing something. Even a small pencil sketch, just of whatever is on your mind. Try baking or cooking something that you really like, hell, throw together your own recipe. even something simple, like your own smoothie with whatever fruits you want. or starting a collection of anything... seashells, rocks, feathers, whatever. maybe this doesn’t help everyone, but for me, I find meaning in creating. Creating artwork, writing and playing songs, building something (even in a game, like Minecraft. Sounds stupid I know, but just designing my own kind of house makes me think, “wow, I did that all on my own. I did something.”) take a hobby or a skill that you like, and utilize that skill to do or make something. don’t have any hobbies? experiment. find something that you like doing. it can be anything. I guess for me, seeing myself as a creator makes me feel like I’m contributing what little I can offer to the world.  I don’t know if this will help you at all, I’m sorry if it doesn’t. but I hope you find your peace and worth.

edit: as a tl;dr,
if you feel meaningless, create your own meaning."
