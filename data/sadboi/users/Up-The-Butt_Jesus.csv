I recently re-watched this after not seeing it for over 20 years.  It held up much better than I expected.  Granted, it's no Oscar-winning masterpiece like Misery, but it's still a quite enjoyable 100 minutes.  Fred Gwynne's performance as the elderly neighbor Jud Crandall is outstanding.  The little guy that plays Gage Creed is great, too.  Even though I know the plot like the back of my hand, the film can still be terrifying at times.  Sometimes, dead is better.

Give re-watching it a shot, you won't regret it."
