Personally, the existential loneliness hasnâ€™t ever fully dissipated yet, but the negative symptoms of a bad trip where I thought I was losing my mind have gone away with time. Iâ€™m sorry your friend had such a bad trip & I hope they feel better soon. Tripping certainly isnâ€™t for everyone, especially if you have difficult things going on in your life at the time. Just keep supporting them & maybe encourage them to seek help if they genuinely feel like killing themselves. Stay safe."

curlygirl,f4al0cw,t1_f4adu66,1571496892.0,I think you can definitely get more defined waves by using the CGM. You might wanna check out getting whats called a DevaCut designed to add more volume & definition to your curls. My hair was a lot straighter a couple years ago & has gotten curlier just by treating it better
curlygirl,f4aaqtt,t1_f48y7q8,1571491512.0,"from my understanding based on other posts in this sub, transitioning hair is when your hair is in the transient stages after beginning CGM, moving into the healthier stages. So if you have a natural curl or wave, when itâ€™s transitioning, it becomes more apparent, as your hair is getting healthier, but itâ€™s still not quite reached the end goal. While transitioning & getting healthier, it is entirely possible for your hair to get curlier - itâ€™s happening to me! So keep at it & Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something that works"
astrology,f4aa422,t1_f4a7x1y,1571491227.0,"Thats a fair analysis. I guess as a libra who has been victimized for most of their life, I related to that part of his life, but perhaps thats more of my heavy 8th house placements being related to trauma & abuse, as you said"
