- def splurge and go for the good suit with the accessories if you‚Äôre buying the suit, not like a zentai one that‚Äôs printed on
- the wig gets pretty heavy depending on what bow you use, so idk if that would bother you but it gives me headaches so maybe bring some Tylenol 
- false eyelashes go a long way with cosplay, I would use some on the top and on the bottom of your eyes 
- plus you can use concealer or foundation on your lips to get that ‚Äúanime no lips‚Äù look froppy has, and use black eyeliner at the edges to make your mouth look wider like hers
- if we‚Äôre just talking about cons in general for advice, drink lots of water and keep your bag close
- practice froppy‚Äôs poses for con pics
- oh and also if you‚Äôre doing the uniform, wear shorts! Cons have soooo many creeps that try to get upskirt shots 
I hope these are helpful! ^_^"
