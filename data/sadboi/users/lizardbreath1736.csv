A good method I used to do for my brides with small tattoos was use an orange concealer (helps to cancel out the colors of the tattoo from showing underneath the makeup) to start going over the tattoo, stippling on in small amounts with a sponge and blending the edges well. Powder to set, then stipple over with your colour of foundation, powder again and spray with setting spray or hairspray. As well, there are other kinds of makeup that are a bit more durable you could ask your MUA about - such as alcohol palettes or PAX paints - they are WAY more tough and guaranteed not to transfer.

TrollXChromosomes,f27w8e3,t1_f27virk,1570047403.0,I agree wholeheartedly!!
AmItheAsshole,f2795po,t3_dbx75g,1570033157.0,"NTA. Who are all these people who just cant survive one meal without meat?? Or need to ""manage their expectations"" about a vegetarian meal? Wtf does that even mean?"
food,f20ri9s,t1_f20kwlz,1569863143.0,"It works pretty well! I made a roux with unsweetened cashew milk last night and it wasnt bad. Slightly nutty flavor but I added a bit extra salt and you dont even notice! Probably would be even better in this recipe, yum!"
CasualConversation,f1xuh49,t3_daqccs,1569804226.0,"My SO is the worst when we go through the drive through. Usually I have an idea of what I'm going to have but he insists he needs to look at the menu every time. He also is a person who wants to add like 20 extra things to his burger or whatever. So I'm always like, ""Yeah I'll get the cheeseburger but can I add onions, thai sauce, lettuce and tomato?"" I find it so cringey and awkward. First he takes so long to decide then he has to  customize the fuck out of it. Makes my social anxiety cringe."
AskReddit,f1xq4ik,t3_daw4jx,1569802236.0,I was lonely as hell living alone in a new city and had no friends. Reddit helped me cope with the anxiety and social isolation I felt. Plus I had a friend in my hometown who would frequently tell me about how much she loved to read Reddit. So I just gave it a try.
LifeProTips,f1wdq3s,t3_dar1zf,1569783473.0,"I once sent my grandma an email because there was some pictures I had on my computer I wanted to show her (she lives far away). I didnt hear anything back for a while and then one day I got a card in the mail from her responding to my email! It was the cutest thing ever. She referred to email as ""electronic mail"" which made me giggle. Since then we've been somewhat pen pals, writing a few letters back and forth a year sharing pictures and recipes."

AskReddit,f1n6kpt,t3_d9urph,1569610144.0,Dont listen so much to what your parents and people around you think. Follow your heart and dont be pressured into doing things that dont feel right.
Showerthoughts,f1kdh7h,t1_f1jhng7,1569534488.0,"I had a manager when I was a teenager that would scream at us if we were caught sitting. Pretty sure she hated high school kids but I digress. This was in the outside flower/garden department of a major chain grocery store. Often we would work 9 hour shifts and it was a lot of hard work, especially on sunny days. She would spend her lunch breaks in her car watching us from the parking lot to make sure we weren't sitting. I was always a good worker (like always followed the rules and never clocked out a minute early) and sat down for a minute, literally only a min or two, near the end of my shift to look in our flyer for something for a customer. I guess she didnt like that and came over and screamed at me! Still scars me for life and I am afraid of getting in trouble at work to this day..."
dataisbeautiful,f1f8lpv,t3_d92ocn,1569439069.0,"I had pain constantly for the 8 months I had my IUD in. Wish I had tracked that, would have been so interesting to see it all laid out like this!!"
AskWomen,f1doetg,t3_d8vwli,1569391988.0,"I usually wash my hair at night, when its semi dry I just pull everything up as if I were doing a high pony then twist it into a bun on the top of my head and clip it with a big clip! I sleep like that and when I unravel in the morning my hair has a soft, curly wave. Sometimes I have to just lightly brush the roots for fly aways, but most of the time it looks pretty ok."
TrollXChromosomes,f0t88i7,t3_d542bv,1568917606.0,"Not too early gal, I've had mine months ago. You got this! We are all here for you!"
TrollXChromosomes,f0hatvq,t3_d4pbrj,1568617088.0,"You're not alone, I have gone through a similar situation recently. I ended up resigning from my job. Your health and well being needs to come first, everything else will follow naturally. Sending hugs!"
