However the few interactions I had without an adult around were universally negative. It is likely because we had a self-centered attitude. It may have been because we are teens, but as Americans we are indoctrinated to believe that we are the best at literally everything and evidence to the contrary usually results in something akin to fingers plugging ears and the listener saying ""la la la la"" to drown out what they don't want to hear. Not in everyone, but there is a large faction of Americans who truly believe we have achieved perfection as a nation. There is also a growing number of people (Thank you Gen Y and Z) who know this isn't true and take a much more...honest(?) Look at ourselves and how we can better interact in the global environment.
