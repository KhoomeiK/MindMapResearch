As for moisturizer, if you wouldn’t put it on your face, don’t use it down there. Something non-comedogenic is best!"

It’s so hard learning to trust people after betrayal like that, but it seems like you’re well on your way. And while you absolutely don’t have to look a certain way to be a “real” woman, I think you look fantastic and feminine and I never would have know you were trans if you didn’t say it. Also I love the piercings! I wish I had the confidence to pull that off!"

But you’re not crazy. Regardless of what your fucking awful family might say, your rapist was obviously in the wrong. It feels absurd that I have to say that (not saying you’re crazy for needing to hear it, just that people are awful sometimes). I’m so glad you’re taking steps forward. There’s no magic amount of time after which you’re supposed to be “over it.” Please take time for yourself to unpack and process and heal, and know you’re loved and that’s it’s okay to be not okay"

I used to drive myself insane wondering what it was my abusive exes found with new people that I apparently didn’t have. But shitty people perfect their craft. And draw in new victims. 

Sending big hugs and support to you. Feel your feelings, write them out, do an audio journal and yell and cry if you need to. You’ve got this and you’re strong to have made it this far"

AmItheAsshole,eq180dq,t3_bwr3l5,1559703106.0,"YTA. Grow up. Your daughters are entering a very confusing time in their lives and you’re reinforcing a message that you don’t care. If they have problems, they should be comfortable coming to you, not scared that they’ll gross you out. 

You emphasize not wanting to hear about it because they’re your daughters. Periods may be a part of the reproductive system, but they’re not inherently sexual. They’re a normal part of healthy bodily function and usually start years before people become sexually active.

Since you’re aware your sex ed was lacking, maybe take the initiative to do a little research about basic biology. Your wife and daughters are women, but so are half the people on earth. Can’t hurt to know a little more about them."

The cast member working said they had sold out of Mulan dresses, but I think they just didn’t bother to stock enough. I only have one Pocahontas pin and none for Mulan, despite looking for good ones all the time. Totally agree they need more merch and general representation. Even Merida seems to get more attention than Pocahontas"

AmItheAsshole,eoetbib,t3_briguv,1558507485.0,"NTA. A lot of people seem to be confused about the idea of a sociopath. It gets bungled in pop culture a lot. Two specific DSM diagnoses are often lumped together under the unofficial umbrella of ""sociopathy."" 

Narcissistic Personality Disorder is the milder diagnosis. People with NPD have very little empathy and focus almost exclusively on themselves. They have an incredibly inflated sense of their own value and importance and view others as less than. All this means that they can be toxic and manipulative to those around them. But they still have emotions. They still feel affection for people,  it's just much more self-motivated. I have a friend with NPD, and sometimes the things he says freak me out because he's so bizarrely disconnected from the feelings of other people. But I interact with him with that in mind. I know what he's like and am careful to guard myself accordingly, and we have a fun and fascinating relationship. Those with NPD can choose to work on themselves and with others and aren't necessarily inherently dangerous.

Anti-Social Personality Disorder (what OP mentioned their daughter has) is much more extreme. ASPD diagnoses can only be made for people 18 and over, and the childhood version of it is known as Conduct Disorder. It often manifests in violence towards other children and adults with no sign of guilt or remorse after and escalates from there. Those with ASPD are functionally incapable of empathy and don't experience emotions in the same way as the average person. They never really love or form an emotional attachment to anyone. They're utterly cold. Some people with ASPD have successful and uneventful lives. They're often very good at social manipulation and learn to mimic what they know are the desired behaviors. But it can be very dangerous to be in close relationships with people who don't care about anyone but themselves and who have no internal ""moral compass"", so to speak. Things could go well on the surface, but most people don't want to be in a one-sided relationship. And far too often things go very, very wrong. Physical and/or emotional abuse are common. If the daughter had kids, she would be unable to provide any emotional support or affection, and that is a terrible way to grow up. Regardless of what caused the ASPD (it's more common in abuse victims, but that's not always the case), those diagnosed with it are a risk.

OP, you're in a horrible situation. Of course you love your daughter and want what's best for her. And I don't know how you could easily bring that up with BF without compromising your relationship with her. But I'd say firm NTA for wanting to save a great guy from what could be a life-altering mistake. If he's ok with the diagnosis and wants to proceed, more power to him, but he deserves to know."
