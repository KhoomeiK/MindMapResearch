Last time I checked, Reddit is a place where people often ask for advice, and that's what I was giving, my advice. You have no idea what I've been through either and your experience is obviously not as bad as most people on this thread since you claim that's it's ""easy"" to taper off of benzos . And since when is addiction a fucking competition? You need to check yourself before you post rude ass comments. Yes, people need serious means for a solution. And again, I was giving advice from my own personal experience. Again, have some fucking compassion and empathy. And stop being rude and ignorant. Also, it's MRS. Shining Armor to you. Have a good one."

benzodiazepines,fpigrbq,t3_gda81v,1588640575.0,"I've been prescribed Xanax for 15 years. I'm 37. When I was going to my first doctor, he had me all the way up to 8mg a day (4 bars a day) I remember thinking abt weaning off of them. I asked the nurse when I could start tapering off and she looked at me, and I quote ""Honey, you're going to be on Xanax for the rest of your life."" My heart sank. Obviously I became addicted to them and eventually got caught when I ran out of my prescription early and asked if I could have another refill bc ""someone stole my bottle at a new years eve party"" I eventually got kicked out of that doctor's office and my parents sent me to rehab in California. (I lived in Ohio at the time, so needless to say I was scared shitless) I ended up being there for 7 months and came back home. Guess what the first thing I did was? I found another doctor to prescribe me Xanax. Now I'm on 4mg a day and it's a bitch bc my tolerance is so high that 4mg barely touches my anxiety. I usually take 6-8mg a day and always run out of them half way through the month and let me tell you, it's a living hell. I've had seizures, hallucinations, mental breakdowns, etc. but I can't stop bc they really help me. I have GAD and MDD. I also have  Bipolar II. My memory is also shit. For example, I guess I talked to my friend 2 times on the phone last night and today I asked him ""Why didn't you call me?"" He said that we talked on the phone twice. I was shocked. I don't even want to know what I said. Luckily he still talks to me even though he told me I need to lay off the xanax (I also drink, too) I know of someone who took their own life because of Xanax withdrawal. Im scared to death. I know damn well I'm not going to be able to stop taking them. I also get SUPER paranoid when I run out and I hate it. I'm lost and in a vicious cycle. I lost all my friends, pushed away family members, and my boyfriend is getting fed up. If anyone is going through the same thing or you just want to talk, hit me up. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
lamictal,fpicgrg,t3_gdj1pr,1588638070.0,"I'm not sure abt the withdrawal but I'm thinking about tapering off it myself. I've been on it for 4 years at 400 mg. Have you noticed your hair falling out? I swear my hair is thinner since I started taking it but I'm also on Wellbutrin, Xanax, and Viibrd. My doctor told me that Lamictal does cause hair loss but like I said, I'm on an array of other meds and don't know if any of those would be causing it."

Needless to say, my PC got into trouble and I had to find a new doc and she isn't budging from 4mg a day. I'm not really complaining bc I would like to eventually taper down. I also have a fam history of anxiety on both sides... Been prescribed benzos since I was 25 (on and off) im 37 now. I'm a small framed woman so I get a lot of strange looks when I tell them I'm on 4mg of xanax a day lol. Sorry for rambling about myself. I hope your doc understands your situation. Just keep stressing how bad your anxiety is and that it's been in your fam for as long as you can remember. Hope you get what you're looking for! Happy Tuesday to you, too! üôÇüôÇüôÇ"

I've been using Covergirl's tinted moisturizer for years (now it's BB cream, thats how long I've been using it lol) I've bought high-end and drugstore foundations here-and-there and I've never liked the look of them on my skin. Not to brag, but my skin is in pretty good shape for 37 years old that I sometimes go out without any makeup at all. But when I do use the BB cream, I use witch hazel and No. 7 serum first. Then Olay moisturizer. I then apply the BB cream, Covergirl concealer, then Hourglass Veil setting powder. And imo, I think it looks pretty perfect!

People will sit and wait for an hour to use it. (they only have one) If they were smart they would get rid of 2 of the lay downs and replace them with stand ups, imo."
