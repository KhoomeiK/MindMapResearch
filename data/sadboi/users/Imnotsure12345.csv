People who aren’t happy for me when something good happens to me, and when something unfortunate is occurring in my life, reminding me of it constantly.

People who are judgemental and have a closed mind. You can’t just send them a meme because they’d find it weird, you can’t discuss odd dreams you’ve had because, yep you guessed it, they’d find it weird.

It makes me want to just get away from the person as soon as possible, and be around someone who will comfort me, or just be completely alone for a bit. And it’s also a feeling of disappointment, like ‘why would you say that? I don’t get why you had to say that? Why be mean for no reason? I was okay but now, because of *you*, I’m not’. It’s worse if it’s someone I consider a friend, or a family member, or if it’s done to only me and they’re nice to everyone else. 

Thankfully it occurs very, very rarely these days because I try to steer clear of people like that as much as possible. I also get it if someone blatantly ignores me. Like I ask them an innocent question, or I say ‘hello’ to them, and they clearly heard, but choose not to respond. Bonus points if I’m the only one they’re ignoring."

introvert,fq9x49s,t3_ghj2ej,1589208759.0,"Yeah, sometimes I question whether I’m an introvert because I love taking opportunities in which new, close friends can be made. And I like having someone, or a couple of people, who I can tell little details to and turn to, and have them do the same. I see these jokes about introverts avoiding phone calls from friends and getting excited over cancelled plans, and I can kind of relate to that in regards to acquaintances and people I’m not close with, but I often feel like I’m missing out if I’m not available for a hangout with close friends. And I love deep, one-on-one phone calls with someone who gets me. When I don’t have that, I feel lonely. So for that reason, sometimes I feel like I’m less of an introvert.

In reality, I *am* introvert, since I just really value close friendship and get drained by having loads of acquaintances and less close friends to have to maintain a facade around. There’s still this untrue stereotype that introverts are all hermits who shun contact and stay in their rooms all the time, and never feel lonely."

That’s an interesting take. I hope this doesn’t get removed for derailing but I love patient people who accept people for who they are, who are forgiving of social awkwardness, who laugh it off, pretend not to notice or reassure you that it’s fine if you do/say something a bit weird, and might even find it endearing.

Yeah, I guess cities would evacuate, but I read that nuking the asteroid would be the last resort. However, they’re currently working on changing asteroids’ trajectories. They’re sending something to take a sample from a particular asteroid in 2021 so we can learn more about them.

I found this:
‘a lead time of five to 10 years is probably the minimum needed for humanity to mount a kinetic-impactor deflection mission, which would send a spacecraft out to knock the hazardous space rock off course, Chodas said. 

If we have considerably more time than that, we might be able to employ the nonviolent ""gravity tractor"" method, slowly nudging the rock away from Earth with a fly-along probe. And if we have very little time at all, we might have to quite literally employ the nuclear option’.

If it’s a coworker however or an acquaintance you vaguely know, then it’s just not worth the conversation and will only lead to unnecessary drama. A bit of venting about these people to someone who you know won’t blab, like your SO, is healthy.

I don’t think that someone saying to their girlfriend ‘my boss was in a horrible mood and shouted at everyone today, it was so annoying’ makes them a toxic, two-faced snake who should NEVER be trusted."
LifeProTips,fp3kj2x,t1_fp2mzab,1588280914.0,I agree. It’s annoying when venting about people is automatically blanketed as toxic behaviour. It comes across as slightly victim-blaming. What if the person being talked about is doing a horrible thing to the person talking about them? Are they supposed to just keep it to themselves and deal with it? It’s also hypocritical because I don’t think there’s anyone on the planet who has never found someone annoying and talked negatively about them. Could you imagine if everyone just told people to their faces that they found them annoying? There would be so much unnecessary conflict and drama. Venting to someone you trust is important.
