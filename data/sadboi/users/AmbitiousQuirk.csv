I believe I am in the ignore-all/discard phase with my Narc anyway as she hasn‚Äôt seen me or made an attempt to even contact me for over 2 months. I think it‚Äôs wise to drop all resentment and help each other out right now the best that we can but there‚Äôs no budging her and that‚Äôs fine. It may also be fine if she says there‚Äôs no use in worrying and she casts all fears aside (I believe it is a lie to feel you won‚Äôt ever worry, not once, in this pandemic) but goddamn it‚Äôs okay to be scared and brave at the same time. I know she is. But she won‚Äôt let me help her. And that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm letting it go."

It was the matter that things were going to change and everyone should prepare for it. Even if the virus is killing mostly elderly/unhealthy people, nobody likes being sick and everybody should have been mindful to not spread it. The attitude of my friend ‚ÄúThis dumb virus will not stop me from attending a conference in an affected city three towns over‚Äù is careless to me.
My husband and I were already in discussion and mentally aware how weird it will be to change our natural human normalcies and habits. To be mindful when touching things and not our faces, to give company stricter boundaries when they were visiting last week (no longer, as we are 100% social distancing), or refusing to eat out as we have more control with us touching our food at home. We had to leave our comforts.
But to my friends it was all malarkey."
PinkpillFeminism,fhugjuy,t3_f4mq1i,1581886142.0,"HI. Original writer here.I've seen my story is shared here after my post gave me a link ""discussions in 1 other community"". Yeah, the mod took it down.I'm honestly outraged with this post I just found talking about myself, a hetero-woman having a problematic-moment with her husband.. It's not even a fight... Free-game, whatever.But people that imply other people to just ""dump him"" or leave him to me are small-minded depending on the circumstance, grey areas. You don't know the whole story. This thing you've shared is pretty insensitive and doesn't help AT ALL for myself or my family. I could type out the whole entire circumstance of my original post, but that would be far too long. I summarized it at best.

I'm allowed to have hurt feelings (such as even now by this). I don't know why people took it that way that I wasn't allowed to. I never said that. I just wanted to cope with the thought of what he wrote and move on from the situation, not the man. My husband encourages me to express my feelings all the time because I was raised in a place where I never felt emotionally heard. He fucked up. YES he did. He's taking accountability for it. He's showing me the proof and where he did wrong while we talk it out. We're not perfect. And he's very well aware and sympathetic of what he did. All of it. Basically, the reason *why I find it accidental* and yes, it was his fault, is because we've been in conversation about threesomes for quite some time and he didn't know that that's not what I wanted for Valentine's Day along with the accident of writing his lust for another woman. Lately, I've not been in the mood for the thought of any threesome. Sometimes I am open to the fantasy, sometimes I'm not. I need to communicate that better when I get in those ways because I don't always communicate and try to just go with the flow. My husband never meant to hurt my feelings, taking content from other's work online and failing to proofread it right. It was negligence. He fucked up by not checking what was written about another woman being better. It hurts. It still stings. He knows that.

I have a lot of problems. I know. I'm working on myself and have been going to therapy to strengthen my boundaries and self-respect. \[I'm not a pickme girl\] And I don't need this. It's not helpful at all.

I've known this man for 11 years. My husband is not a waste of oxygen. Fuck this.\[I don't even care if it's a satire sub. It's not cool\]"

I don‚Äôt know if this is just my state of mind right now saying this, but she is the purest, sweetest, non-judging angelic person of all my friends.
I have kept all of my closest best friends with me since high school and sure, some of them have changed, some have become a little toxic, even she had to grow in areas but she has been the best there ever was.

I have got her ‚Äîthe angelic fight-for-rights friend; the common sense-sarcastic brainy friend, the glittery-happy go lucky but draining friend, a childfree Dog-Mom ghosting friend who occasionally rings to see me or something, a new bad-bitch but loyal friend, and currently another new stern-but also-loyal Mom friend from work.

I occasionally get a message from old acquaintances and past friends who have faded away from me and thats nice.. But nothing tops my best friends.... even if I think I should dessert them sometimes which is so messed up. Maybe some of it is wrong perception of humanly love and friendship. Sometimes my paranoia just tells me there‚Äôs an ulterior motive behind it all with a few of them. But again I think that‚Äôs my mental state."

J breaks up with S sometime later. S is young, and devastated by the rejection. I (K) spent a lot of time at S‚Äôs house. Tons of sleepovers. When I learn of this, I take a black fine tip sharpie and scribble K over J. And write ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. And a goofy cute smiley.

It‚Äôs been years and her Mom sent her this picture. And she sent it to me.

Funny story: S is now married and with two little girls to a J. But not the same J. So it was all meant to be anyway."

Is it a codependency issue? Who knows.

Eve of the Wedding at the Dinner Rehearsal, some family drama happened with the bride that came close to a physical altercation hadn't anyone stepped in to break it up. The bride was naturally really upset and almost kicked out that family member from attending the wedding/said they couldn't drink. Lots of comfort overnight.  
Next day, that family member acted as if nothing happened. We checked their belongings to make sure liquor wasn't snuck into the venue. All was well. The bride was cranky and said her wedding was going to be a shit show.  
I did what I could. I set up the tables and chairs, draped the cloths, made sure the dance floor was ready. Drew signage on a chalk board. Set up the guest book.  Hung some photos and helped with the decor. And we were all set and good to go.  
No Assholes here (except the family member).  


In the bridal suite we chilled, drank champagne, eased the bride of her stress and negativity by even holding her hands and deep breathing together. And it was time to go! The wedding was beautiful, short, sweet, to the point.. and I danced my cares away (and my ass off) til midnight."
