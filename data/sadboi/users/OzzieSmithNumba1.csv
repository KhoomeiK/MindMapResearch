My last 2 cities have been amazing/ good with options, so I'm from places where if you don't find a couch Tuesday, you'll find one by Saturday. In thrift drought cities, that might not be the case. Dress for Success is a charity with a different aim:  providing good clothes to those who have limited access to them. They also do prom dress events."

I'm finally out of my penny-pinching 20s, but still shop at thrift stores. Affordability is nice, but now reducing the labor demands of each piece and reducing my carbon footprint is just as nice.

You're supporting (sometimes dubious) charities with your purchase. I'd be pissed, too, if someone took my couch find. Thrifting gets competitive."

Both dog trainers I used rolled their eyes about puppy personality dictating dog personality. Dude is 3 and very brave, curious, and loving, but I think it's because he's had a very good 3 years of constant human companionship, training, and socialization outside of the home with people and various pets."
