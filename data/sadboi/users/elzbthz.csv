ACNHTrade,fp4npbi,t3_gb8nqx,1588303067.0,hi there! lots of stuff has been taken but theres still some things left + if you want to talk to celeste she's still here :D
ACNHTrade,fp4bmd3,t3_gb8nqx,1588295618.0,"hello! so, i was cleaning out my storage so theres a bunch of stuff! there's a little bit of everything :) if you'd like to water the flowers, they are in rows to the right of all the items! if you leave any flowers you can put them on the beach! please don't take a bunch of stuff, leave some for others hehe! anyways, thank you so much :)"
BPD,fo7hbke,t3_g61u5j,1587578333.0,"so I'm not officially diagnosed but I've been doing a lot of research about bpd + discussing with my psychs for the past two years since I was about 16, when i started feeling there was something else there and not only depression/anxiety and I really identify with all of the characteristics. 

anyway, thank u for posting this because i have noticed the same exact patterns in myself. even just this february I became attached and literally ~fell in love~ with a person i was talking to on tinder after not even a full day. we went out twice and they slowly stopped messaging me and lets just say it wasn't a good two months for me lol..but now, without that (and going back to my pretty much nonexistent ""social life"") I am so much more stable. (tho they texted me a couple days ago lol).  i also noticed this in the past with another ~friendship (one lasting over two years, and after they ended it because of how I acted..I was overall more stable afterwards. not all the time but much more than the years prior) ..but i cant think too much about it because I start spiraling hahah

i just thought it was nice to hear it coming from someone else because I feel really crazyðŸ˜…  anyway im sorry if this is too long or if this doesnt belong here since i dont have any official diagnosis."
AnimalCrossingTrading,fn70a8k,t3_g003hv,1586710797.0,"hi!! i like the cute vanity and cute diy table and record player!! from ur wishlist I have the cypress bathtub, birdbath and clothesline and peach rug if U wanna trade :)"
AnimalCrossingTrading,fmfqquo,t3_fuzc7e,1586032889.0,"i have 15 leaf, 62 sky, 31 stone, 5 water and 36 wood if you still need any !!"
truelesbians,fggrqot,t1_fggcyf7,1580768092.0,"you're right. it's hard because people have such a weird thing against someone being desperate/them being seen as desperate and i overanalyze everything so I have no idea what might be seen as even slightly annoying. but youre right, if theyre interested then i guess that won't matter as much. 

i messaged her today and asked about going to see a movie and she said she'd love to this weekend and asked for my instagram ( if it works out this is my first date ever im nervous lol) but we haven't video chatted yet..i didnt even think about it because honestly i hate doing it but, i do see the value in it"
truelesbians,fggqdxy,t1_fgg6r8u,1580767252.0,"not going beyond the first conversation is so weird and frustrating.. what a waste of time! i am horribly shy but like to be very straight forward when talking about my feelings, i HATE skirting around things. 

i have heard a lot of stories of some bi girls not actually wanting a female partner and that can be scary but i feel bad passing judgements so early on because I know for many thats not the case. or maybe its just my naivety lol

but i actually messaged her again today (she messaged last yesterday) to go to a movie and she said she'd love to this weekend and asked for my instagram so hopefully it turns out well :')"
truelesbians,fgg8nf3,t1_fgg3vte,1580756618.0,"oh shit that's smart ending the first conversation while asking if they wanna meet i'm mad i didnt think of that lol!!!!
she was the last one that messaged last night and i just messaged her now and asked if she wanted to see a movie or something and immediately closed the appðŸ’€

but yeah, you're right about the whole ~waiting another day thing. it wont make a difference. I guess its because I've seen a lot of people talk about how they dont want to seem desparate so they wait for a certain amount of time to say something. i hate that, but i also dont want to seem weird to them either. why is this so complicated lol!"
MuscularDystrophy,faj61iy,t3_e9h8ph,1576125530.0,"hi! i'm actually an older sister to my brother who's 11 with DMD as well! I've personally never seen any groups for it honestly and any of the conferences I've been to with my family, the only siblings there are younger kids. my best guess would be on facebook maybe? i'm not totally sure of anything specifically but if you wanna talk let me know! i've never spoken to siblings of anyone with dmd either"
truelesbians,fadru4j,t1_fadq0qu,1575984436.0,the person that made the comment is actually a (cis) girl but yeah the sentiment still stands
truelesbians,fad1ksh,t1_fad0qd7,1575952572.0,i got happy seeing the trend and then saw the few most popular videos with that sound are bi girls..and the comments.. its like great maybe come up with your own thanks? but this girls comments just made me kinda ðŸ™ƒ
BingeEatingDisorder,f7g3hit,t1_f7fcha6,1573693598.0,"my psych compared it to a bridge as well but at the time I honestly wasn't listening and was just so set on losing the weight. I was disappointed it wasn't my ~magic cure~ and just wanted a higher dose to wipe out my appetite. i definitely set my expectations too high lol. i think i'm just not in the best headspace regarding my weight at the moment but idk if I have ever been. before I was on vyvanse/a while after i first started I surrounded myself with a lot of toxic mindsets regarding food and was going between starving myself or throwing up everything I binged.
i really do need to figure out why I have such an urge to binge but i honestly have no clue and I feel like im stuck in that area but. ugh. thank you honestly. i was also reading that it can mess with your heart with long term use which scared me a bit too.  but i'm going to try to look at it more objectively and not as my ~magical 100% cure-all potion"
kittens,f2187el,t1_f2141l5,1569869106.0,"hehe thank you :) i have five! we found the two older girls outside of my house alone in may. one under my mom's car, the other one 7 hours later next to our garage. 

i saw the mom cat days later and fed her so i could hopefully trap her and get her fixed but she disappeared. then in the beginning of august i go to check the mail and see the SAME exact mom cat with three kittens on my porch. i still couldn't get the mom even after feeding her throughout the day and now I'm not sure where she is again but we got the three babies at least. 

and it's a strange coincidence that we found them a couple of weeks before we had to put the oldest lady (who was 19) of our other set of five kitties to sleep"
BingeEatingDisorder,ezrpn7q,t1_ezrj8bd,1568077070.0,"thank you so so so much <3 i appreciate the app recommendations, i particularly really like the idea of shye, I'll download them and try them out right now!"
BingeEatingDisorder,ezrdpqj,t1_ezrbtde,1568072346.0,"thank you so much, you're so so so kind and it means a lot to me. i will definitely join, I've heard all about discord and I've never used it but it sounds like a really good idea. 
best of luck to you, as well !! :))"
HomeworkHelp,eyzf1e7,t1_eyzeajn,1567616258.0,"thank you for confirming my suspicions lol. im guessing it may be a typo, but if not I have no idea"
HomeworkHelp,eyzeidk,t1_eyzctrh,1567615919.0,yeah I honestly think theres a typo. i've tried doing it by what the book says over and over and eventually gave up and went to mathway symbolab etc and they all said it's not factorable.
HomeworkHelp,eyzdzd4,t1_eyzd9ef,1567615576.0,just wondering from the first pair wouldnt y^3 be left and not y^2 or no?
HomeworkHelp,eyzczyh,t1_eyzbm83,1567614932.0,"that definitely works!! thank you so much!! i am confused on one thing though. when you're factoring out (2x^3 y^3 - x^2 y^3)  i kept getting x^2 y^3 (2x). so you would leave a y inside the parenthesis even after factoring out the y^3?

edit: ok now i'm not sure since it isn't necessarily grouping them. i think there's a typo in the problem, I'm having this issue with another problem too so i'm going to contact the instructor and hopefully i'm not just going crazy?"
HomeworkHelp,eyzaqee,t1_eyz9fqb,1567613460.0,i didnt think of that but do you mean like seperate (-x^2 y^3 ) and then group the other three terms? i end up with -x^2 y^2 (y) and -y(2x^3 y^2 +2x) which I don't know if it works...but maybe I'm doing it wrong:/. sorry if the formatting for the numbers is wrong I'm on mobile and kind of new to posting
relationship_advice,evdtxyk,t3_cjdb3d,1564447397.0,this is so adorable and sweet it makes my heart warm :( i literally went through the same thing with my ex best friend and it didnt go the way i would have wished (although it was probably for the best lol) and I'm so so happy that it worked out for you and i wish both of you the best
ACT,erge0oz,t1_ergdqvo,1560835383.0,"i hope you do well!! and even if you dont get the 29 today, you have a lot of time between now and then and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get there. good luck!!!"
