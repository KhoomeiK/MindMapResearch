I also smoke cigarettes. Like i said any chemical u add to ur body can affect you. I take haldol and it has plenty of sideaffects. Ive been taking medication since i was 14. I had doctors say ive ruined my liver. They said id be lucky to make it to age 30. I dont really care though because my medication keeps me sane.

So i realized religious voices will follow me forever. ... but only because i assume that the voices i hear, are those characters. Has anyone named their voices?

schizoaffective,f83kcbv,t3_ds5a01,1574213958.0,Im doing much better. My support system has been wonderful. Im trying now to cut down on cigarettes... but the stress just keeps getting to me. Lol. School is more manageable and im feeling better on the meds that i chose to be on. My doctor is very considerate of my opinions. Im surrounded by great people and need to remember that when i get depressed. They are the reason i wake up every morning and do my best.... and people like you who cheer me on. Thank you. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Then i preceded to just sit down and take notes like nothing happened. Lol. I learned to laugh at myself. It was the only way to get past the embarrassment and shame. I tell my stories all the time. The more i tell them the less power they have over me. At first it was hard but now im not affected by any of them. Now my main problem is not oversharing, cuz my stories are personal and crazy and hard to believe or understand. Thanks for your message. ü•∞"

Im glad that I had some people around me that knew what to do. At the time my parents didnt know what to do and put me back in school. Lets just say, it didnt go well. It took me about 6 years to feel comfortable enough to go onto a school campus again. I am glad I took the risk though because I love school and it makes me happy. My teachers have always supported me. Thank you for sharing your story. It helped me."

Then I sat back down and continued taking notes, like nothing happened. I learned to laugh at myself a long time ago. I look back at the stories of my psychosis like a funny movie or story book. Occasionally fun to watch but sometimes cringy and embarrassing and often with a lot of bathroom humor. üòì congrats on passing your class by the way! That is a real accomplishment.

I just realized that medications all have side effects, but some are worth it. And some are not. Everyone has a different experience.

schizoaffective,f5p0b3q,t3_dnik5y,1572342552.0,"My first psychosis was well.... a crap chute. My family had never experienced anything like it before. So let me tell you this, it was baaaaad. For example: every time i screamed, my mom would panic and cover my mouth so the neighbors wouldnt call the cops, well this only made things scarier for me. I thought she was a demon or something. (Hard to get into reasoning without romanticizing). In my opinion it is best to prepare your family for EXACTLY what is to come, so they can also prepare. They do not want to make things worse. They can actually help you calm down when you start to get anxiety or panic by saying key words you give them that calm you down. Even in your daily life; you might want to even just start with words that trigger you or things that upset you(everyone has these, even non-schizoaffective people) i try to be as open and honest as i can without reliving the past or going into detail. I just say what is important. ‚ÄúI get triggered by being alone to much.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the dark, can we get a small light for the bedroom?‚ÄùI hope this works for you, please keep posting."

After my psychosis i was left with a few unsavory qualities. I did think i was God... so im a little more selfish and way more curious. Now i realize i have double standards on alot of things.

I try not to let myself fall deeper or feed into the voices by talking back to them.  A good method i use when im stressed is reality checks: ‚Äúi am not god‚Äù ‚Äúi am on earth‚Äù ‚Äúthis is the floor, the ceiling, the chair, the lamp, etc.‚Äù Naming real objects around me helps me feel real as well.

If you develop sexual feelings at a younger age you are more likely to be ‚Äúhyper sexual‚Äù but there is nothing wrong with it. Just find a partner who matches you. And make sure you don‚Äôt get into anything that breaks laws or morals. Dont feel odd because there are millions of people like you all around the world, some with an even stronger libido?:)"

Im not one for new things or change to routine so i often fall back to old habits because they are comfortable. But with his support i think i can try to be a better person and change for the better. Acceptance of current situations is sometimes not a good thing.
schizoaffective,f5jtj16,t3_dnik5y,1572240254.0,"I try not to limit people, people are always willing to learn and listen, if you give them a chance. Maybe try and open up to your husband and talk about things you think he might not understand or judge you for. Talk to him honestly and openheartedly. Let him know these are just feelings and that you have an illness that affects your thoughts and thinking processes. I dont know if it is just me projecting but i hope this helps a little bit? 
Therapy was a bit of a lottery for me as well. It takes time and effort to find the perfect fit. Plus you have to work through those first few uncomfortable sessions so you can actually start working on the real shit and see if you like your therapist? I had some really crappy therapists.... i have gone home crying and been sent to psych wards involuntarily. But there are real people who care. It all takes time. Healing is a slow process.

I used to be reliant on others to be happy. My friends would say something small and i would be ready to kill myself over it. Its hard to support someone who constantly wants to die. I had to learn to support myself and be reliant on myself for my own happiness. I couldnt be so reactive based on what others said. I could still be sad but i couldnt wallow. I try not to enjoy being sad and self punish and get even more depressed. Next time if you get sad you can try cheering yourself up even if it is uncomfortable. Doon it will become a pattern or habit and you wont be as depressed or sad. Kind of like ... fake it til you make it... im not saying just get over your depression.

schizoaffective,f5b5liy,t3_dn9tgf,1572117620.0,It can be a combination of both. Dont stress. The memories may come back to you slowly. Focus on today and dont force the memories to come back. You might feel nostalgic one day either eating something you ate when you were younger or going to a place you used to go all the time. Some memories we purposely block out because we feel they are painful. Our brains are sensitive and are smart enough to forget things on their own to protect us. I forgot alot of things i believed during my psychosis. Dont worry so much. The human body is amazing. You are strong.

One could ask their  doctor, or go online and research to see the purpose of anti-psychotics.  I do not know if this is correct but I was told that my medication is taken to ‚Äúre-wire‚Äù my brain and change my thinking. After a while of taking medication i lost those dramatic highs, where i made irrational decisions, those dark lows, and now have a healthier way of working through my thoughts. But that will only come through years of medication. Things balance out. Give things time. If you still feel the same way about your partner in said time then maybe try therapy, definitely talk to your partner! It is good to be open. Try exciting things up - go on dates. Talk!

I try to ask myself, not existentially, but at the moment, ‚Äúwhy am i sad?‚Äù Then, i ask myself, ‚Äúwhat is the solution?‚Äù There is always a choice, and you are the one making it: i had the choice stay and take him to work or drive home to mom and be an eeyore.
