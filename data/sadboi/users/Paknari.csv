SuicideWatch,fpojfuz,t3_gedrgk,1588785520.0,"You did NOTHING wrong. I know you won’t believe this but it needs to be said a million times. Men are not uncontrolled children running around with no ability to keep from having sex. There is nothing that you can wear, nothing you can say, nothing you can do, that should allow a man to do anything you don’t want to do. Also, if you allow it out of fear, you are STILL not a slut. Everyone reacts in situations in different ways. You lease find someone to talk to. You can also message me if you want. I have been through this and it has taken a long time for me to get through it."

I would ask why the CPS agent is going through someone other than yourself or your husband. That seems really sketchy and inappropriate to me. Also, I can’t believe they even took a call like this seriously when the baby is a newborn. Clearly they assessed you at the hospital and you were allowed to leave. Good luck!"

ParentingInBulk,fnms9o6,t3_fxo9r6,1587077184.0,"Honestly screw the critics. Even if you WERE hoarding, isn’t that somewhat understandable?

CPTSD,fn1cqiz,t3_fy8cs6,1586559312.0,I’m so glad that you were able to put this together. And reading your post makes me think of a lot of similarities in my life so thank you for sharing. I never thought if it the way your therapist said it either. I hope this helps you to move forward and feel better.
JUSTNOMIL,fmzig4k,t3_fy5u1h,1586521402.0,Ughhh I’m sorry you had to deal with that! I’ve learned my lesson with renting or living with family! It never ends well.

rant,fk60y0p,t3_fgdtj3,1583891533.0,I don’t know if a single job that doesn’t have a sick time policy. That is why there is FMLA if you are sick for a longer period of time. Just fill out the paperwork and get it signed and you will be fine.

CPTSD,fjouias,t3_feisan,1583535047.0,I’ve had similar experiences. But never a child. I don’t know if I could handle that one either. My friends murder was hard enough and she was 24. I’m sorry that you are going through this.
confession,fjictrt,t3_fdgiql,1583364888.0,"I can completely relate to you. I have struggled on and on off with various substances and I am currently having a hard time.

CPTSD,fiyqza1,t3_fae3xb,1582844987.0,I’m so sorry this happened to you He shouldn’t have left you in a vulnerable state like that and it would be very unusual if he hadn’t hear this type of trauma before. You should in no way feel bad about the abuse or the sharing. You deserve to be heard and I would start looking for someone who you can relate with. I went through a few therapists before I found the one I am with now and. She has helped me through some stuff I never thought I would work through. You deserve someone like that too.
PoliticalDiscussion,fin1x0c,t3_f8d11e,1582553721.0,I’m not sure how this would work. The healthcare could be separate so you would receive care from the VA only I suppose. You have to pay into the GI bill fund so it isn’t completely free so maybe you wouldn’t do that anymore?
SuicideWatch,fignbqf,t3_f7t07v,1582401667.0,"I’m so sorry you are having such a hard time. I find it very difficult to make good friends and have felt the same way you do. I see a therapist now and that really helps because I am truly socially awkward and I am seeing that even though I want the closeness, I also push away the truly supportive people and lean towards drama and false people. It is very frustrating. But there are ways to make things better. If you ever want to talk more in depth message me. I would love to help in any way I can."
SuicideWatch,fibmpah,t3_f6vgg2,1582325294.0,Me too.  It’s hard because I don’t doubt that people love me and it is hard for them to understand that it isn’t their fault.
SuicideWatch,fi8n5x1,t3_f6vgg2,1582243955.0,I completely understand this. I can’t tell you how many times I have thought of suicide or life being better for others if I wasn’t around. But I’ve attempted it and I survived. I am ashamed and I have a tremendous amount of guilt. I wish these feelings would stop but even if they don’t I can’t do it again.

CPTSD,fhkl030,t3_f3mqda,1581686054.0,I can understand your point. But self care doesn’t have to be about consumerism. Usually my idea of self care is watching a good movie or reading a good book without allowing myself to feel guilty for not doing something for someone else.
CPTSD,fhkjtew,t3_f3ftwn,1581685308.0,Oh my gosh I’m so sorry you were treated this way. By both your parents and medical professionals. It is frustrating that people would think that this is a good way to deal with depression and suicide. No one wants to feel terrible. Yes sometimes it is hard to change but that’s only because it is something familiar. I am glad you didn’t kill yourself. Thanks for sharing.
offmychest,fgsf4az,t3_f04i8c,1581082608.0,I have never heard comments like this but I am sorry that this has happened to you. Not everyone think of black people i. The way you are referring. It is sad that these things are even still happening.

I haven’t had a panic attack since receiving it. I’m not sure if you have an insurance that would cover it, but I would consider purchasing it if you can. I’m so sorry that you are struggling so much. I can totally relate."
offmychest,fghbt5w,t3_ey9hoi,1580781327.0,I feel the same way often. I’m glad that you had a good day! I hope you have many more.

But it took a long time and was not always good. I know now that it is not my fault and that there have to be boundaries. I hope that you are able to find peace one way or another.

loseit,fc0sir1,t1_fc0kqf0,1577298648.0,"I’m so sorry that you are going through this. I struggle with bingeing and eating issues myself and I’ve been working on it for years. You are not worthless. There is a really cool app that my therapist has me use to help with bingeing. It’s called recovery records it works best with therapy as well but it could help you understand they why behind your bingeing. Also, would your parents be willing to let you see a nutritionist? There are some that work more with eating disorders but you could always word it differently to your parents if they don’t support therapy. There are also places that are confidential and your parents don’t need to approve. Let me know if you want me to look into some resources for you. This is a battle that I am intimately familiar with and I wish no one had to go through it."
offmychest,f8l9zdv,t1_f8hetn2,1574620125.0,"I agree. I have depression and weed has never done anything for me. I’m actually kind of an asshole when I smoke weed. I’m not sure what but my brain chemistry is not happy with the interaction. It has taken awhile for me to find an antidepressant that works for me though so it always strikes me as silly when people assume one thing will work for everyone. If that were the case, life would be a lot easier."

I want her to feel connected and I worry a lot that she won’t be.

JUSTNOMIL,f4yclkf,t3_dm3yar,1571874616.0," I the only one that thinks your responses to things are WAY over the top? Things like “she bought my toddler SHIRTS!!! He already has shorts, sounds hilarious to me. So what? You didn’t pay for them so if your toddler doesn’t need them donate them. Why would this offend or shock you in any way? Also, if you do t want to bottle feed cool but if she sends a gift like a bottle holder, donate it...who cares? I’ve read through all the posts and honestly it sounds like you have a lot of anxiety, paranoia and worry over things that wouldn’t worry most people. I am concerned that you are going to start having other health issues from not receiving some kind of treatment or help..."

Parenting,f2gmnoj,t1_f2ek2zl,1570232636.0,Ughhhh it’s frustrating to me that a wife feels entitled. She should get off her ass and work also. I know that isn’t always possible but I would stand and beg on the street rather thane or the someone else to completely be responsible for income. But I don’t know what your culture is. I’m sorry that you are going through this. It doesn’t help that you have an ungrateful wife.
offmychest,evhkmbf,t3_cjs0bt,1564527870.0,"I can see this both ways. I have said this to my daughter. At the time she was refusing to help out with ANYTHING and whining about wanting something. Usually these comments are made when a child is acting like a lazy entitled brat who should have everything handed to them. Of course, this isn’t always the case and if it’s said all the time it is ridiculous. But being on your own I  surprised that you don’t see how much your parents did for you and how insulting it is when children whine and complain about not getting everything they want. I sure wish I could go back to being a kid! Like I said I don’t know your situation but these statements in themselves are not toxic. It all depends on the parent."
JUSTNOMIL,ev0xlm3,t3_chxybk,1564148556.0,"I would be upset. And confused. Why would it be an issue if it was done for a medical reason? I would probably do records requests at all the hospitals in the area he grew up just to try, but you might still come up empty handed. If also ask all other family members who might know something. Just be prepared for what you find out. I would also be angry so I think your anger makes sense. It baffles me that someone would keep info like that from the person who had the surgery."
