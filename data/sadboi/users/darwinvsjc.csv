I tried all supplements and the only thing that helped was changing my diet.

Go low dairy, low carb, grain free, fresh and unprocessed (no tinned fish) watch of for FODMAP and histamines in foods

Also would remove the omega 3

ALCAR (acetyl-L-carnitine) should help with athletic performance and general energy 

But I'm afraid im no expert and never trust someones opinion over fact and evidence. I have learnt the hard way and took some manuka pruriens (l-dopa) recommended by a redditor and had a awful reaction 

That being said i was prescribed Effexor/Venlafalxine for OCD and anxiety by a doctor and its has been nothing but a disaster due to the horrible side effects including stomach issues, anhedonia, poor memory and which i can't come off due to withdrawals. Worst thing is the drug didn't work  and i still have ocd and anxiety - so even doctors/experts get things wrong
