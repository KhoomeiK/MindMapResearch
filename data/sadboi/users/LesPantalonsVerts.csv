BuzzFeedUnsolved,f6uuflt,t3_dsndho,1573168970.0,"Normally I don't care for ghost hunting shows, but I don't really mind it with these two. Like others have said, even though Ryan let's himself get ""spooked"" at times, overall many of the episodes almost come off as a parody of ghost hunting shows to me. 

I don't believe in any of the paranormal stuff, but I live for the banter between the boys and Shane constantly making jokes about the stupidity of it all. Plus I feel like even in the hunting episodes, we still get a nice amount of story-telling and background about the places they visit from Ryan before he feels compelled to whip out the Spirit Box."

Plus Margaret already made a Ghostbusters joke (""Who am I, Dan Akroyd?""), and if she's seen it then Montana definitely has."
