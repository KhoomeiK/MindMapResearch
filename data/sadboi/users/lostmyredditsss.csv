Also, friends might not be able to handle some serious issues. They got their own stuff, too. That's why I never want to burden people. As much as I complain that nobody sees me, I'm not sure what I'd do if someone suddenly *did*. You know? Like, I got some *not fun* stuff in my past...why would I unload that onto someone that wasn't trained? It may fuck them up..."

But also, I don't. I don't want to be that person who ends up like the people I can't stand, where I just bitch and moan and everyone thinks I'm a burden or I'm rude.

So...maybe we just need therapists."

I couldn't hurt them like that. Not like they do with me. I could *never*. Besides, nobody is forcing me to be attentive, I just do that automatically.

I shouldn't punish them because I give to much in the relationship..."

People are selfish as shit. Maybe we should learn to be too, huh?"
SuicideWatch,fqijz0j,t3_gins3m,1589397009.0,"It goes both ways.

My roommate constantly told me she wanted to kill herself, and constantly talked about how she hated herself and her life and how she was cutting herself.

I cared. I did everything I could for her. I cleaned her dishes, I bought her dinner, I invited her to parties and friend's places.

But as soon as I accidentally let it slip that I've been suicidal for *years,* you know what she did?

She turned it onto herself. She said, ""Oh yeah, me too, I'm suicidal as shit. I always want to die. And nobody ever cares.""

...So, so much for being a good friend, I suppose. Maybe I wasn't good enough. Or maybe people just give up when people don't care about their efforts to care.

I know I did.

And she has yet to kill herself four years later. Still bitches about it all the time, though."

And you know what I get in return? I'll tell you the exact exchange: I say, ""I'm just not doing well"", to which they say, ""Oh, same. I'm so depressed lately."" and they proceed to tell me about themselves, *not once* rounding back to let me continue. But you know what? I sit there and take it. I never *once* let it slip that I can't fucking stand it when I'm forgotten like that, and I never *once* say the things I think. I never *once* tell them that I don't care because it would *crush me* if someone said that about my problems.

So tell me again *how I'm an abusive and dismissive friend.* Tell me again. Please. *I fucking beg you,* tell me I'm a bad fucking person. I'm abusive just like my dad and my brother and my mom and I'm just continuing the fucking cycle.

*Tell me.*

You don't *even know me* or my situation or what I endure so that my friends feel safe and comfortable. So you better keep your hands off the fucking keys and *leave me alone.*

Fuck you."

I'll have to either a) be content with never being heard, or b) shut up, save up, and go to a therapist to complain. I know this...

I know for a *fact* I want kids, and I want to be a parent. I also know for a *fact* that I don't want genetic kids, because sociopathy, narcissistic personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder run in my family, and I ain't risking it...

But *god* do I want kids.

I just don't want to fuck them up. Even with all my awareness, I have *no idea* how to control nor fix it. I have *no clue.* I mean, I'm only twenty, so how am I supposed to know at this age, right? But I'll do something and hurt someone and feel no regret. I'll lie and feel nothing. I'll manipulate and feel nothing.

So maybe someone like that, someone who has the signs of ASPD like my family members do, *shouldn't have kids.*

Hell, I shouldn't have *friends.* I *feel* dangerous.

But...you know, reading what you said, where you thought you were a psychopath because you didn't feel that deeply: I feel that every damn day. And that just...made me feel *something.* I'm not sure what, but it made me feel something...

So thank you for that.

And thank you for sharing with me. I definitely feel less alone than before, that's for sure.

Why the *hell* would I want to be like them? I'd rather feel pathetic but sane over stronger but be *just like* those (literal) sociopaths...

But thank you for the advice. Maybe one day I can reach that point of trust in myself to *not* become them, but today is definitely not that day..."
