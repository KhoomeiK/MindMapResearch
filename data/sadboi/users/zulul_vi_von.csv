ways to stop suicide: social policycauses of suicide: mental health

ways to stop the flu: medicinecauses of the flu: no money for science

It's all come to mental health and that's what NDT was trying to say, policies/science takes time, the real issue is mental health and people die more than suicide than from shootings. he was right to compare, he is trying to pass the statement that there is a bigger issues in our society rather than changing polices, prevention is important and won't fix the problem all the way, you need to fix the problem itself from the roots, trauma is generated the same for every person dying, everyone is equal more trauma is generated from suicide than from shootings as there are more casualties, he was right that people react to spectacle.

You can invest in gun policy - but people that want to do a shooting will be still able to if they want.You can invest in social policy - but some people will kill themselves anyway. You can invest in medicine - but flu is still alive

&#x200B;

if people would focus on the data they will see there are underlying problems for these subjects, but people only care when there are shootings they don't care 250 people decide to die every 48 hours even after explaining that they are both created from mental health."
