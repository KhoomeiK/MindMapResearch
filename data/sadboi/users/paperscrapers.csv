depression,exva2cf,t3_cuha2b,1566595506.0,"I’m 41 and was making plans to commit suicide when my parents intervened and told me to quit my job and move back to my native state (1,300 miles away from where I lived and worked) to stay with them and get better. It’s been a month and I’m still not better, but I at least have the support of my parents. Since you don’t have that, are you eligible for disability benefits? I believe it’s a long process, but maybe in the meantime you can go on welfare. I was on food stamps and Medicaid for a brief period of poverty/unemployment after my husband divorced me, and I had friends who let me stay with them while I found a job and an apartment and pulled my life together (I wasn’t suicidal or disabled by my depression yet). Support systems are really important. Do you have close friends who can let you stay with them while you try to get better?"
depression,exv94hn,t3_cuhu2c,1566594953.0,"I’ve tried 16 meds for depression and 2 for anxiety over the past 15 years and the only depression med that worked (and it’s not even technically a depression med—it’s an ADHD med used off-label for depression) is one I had to stop taking due to rare and serious physical side effects. I knew it was working because my depression (and anxiety) went away completely. Both anxiety meds worked fairly well, one more than the other, and I knew they were working because I take them for panic disorder and the panic attacks either lessened or, in the case of the more effective one, stopped completely. I hope you are able to find something that works. Unfortunately, I have been extremely unlucky with treating my major (and now suicidal) depression. I even took one of those GeneSight tests, which are expensive and, in my case, completely useless. Good luck."
depression,extz3td,t3_cufntl,1566577071.0,"I don't really have anything to say that can help you. I just wanted to respond because I'm in the same place and know how you feel. I guess that's why we'll all on here--so we don't feel so alone with this horrible demon (that's what I call my depression--I'm not religious at all, I use it figuratively). I hope you can find something that helps soon."
SuicideWatch,extxrjh,t1_ext8f8n,1566576485.0,"The suicide hotlines are not helpful for me at all (and I've tried various ones--both phone and chat--several times). They actually make me feel worse. The people never know what to say and don't provide any practical help, except an ear to listen. For me, just having someone listen isn't enough. I need HELP and every time someone tells me to call a suicide hotline for help I honestly want to scream. If it were enough to just have some stranger listen then there wouldn't be so many people committing suicide. I'm not suggesting that people shouldn't try it, or that it won't help other people. I'm also not saying you're wrong for suggesting it. I have just found it to be the most unhelpful thing for the very thing it's supposed to help. That's just my experience, though."
AdultDepression,euegzlp,t1_eudtc10,1563744150.0,"Thank you for the feedback, and sorry you had to miss some days. It’s definitely a prohibitive treatment in that regard. But even if my depression goes from severe to moderate, it will be worth it."
AdultDepression,eudl99f,t3_cdhjl3,1563720715.0,"What machine did your doctor use? I've got a consultation tomorrow with a psychiatrist who uses NeuroStar for rTMS but I've been reading that deep TMS via BrainsWay is more effective (I've just started researching this, so I don't have any scientific research to back this up yet--I'm not sure if there even is research to back this up). Thanks in advance, and congratulations on achieving some relief from your anxiety and depression. I've been on countless meds and even tried ketamine and nothing has worked for me, so I'm hopeful that TMS will provide some relief. I just want to make sure I choose the right technology!"
