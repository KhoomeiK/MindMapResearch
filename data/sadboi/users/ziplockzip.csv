I only remember the bad which is why I have stopped trying to remember at all. It sucks because now that I'm happy with my SO, I feel like I have such a crappy memory, I can't recall every beautiful memory I've experienced with him, as if my memory as a whole has deteriorated because of childhood trauma."
raisedbynarcissists,fq5mjry,t1_fq5ajul,1589110962.0,"SAME! I clean up instantly in fear or being seen as lazy or messy. God forbid I leave a plate unwashed just as nmom walks in and all she remembers is how I didn't do the dishes. (I also couldn't be seen doing 'nothing' coz that's me being lazy and unhelpful again, but that's for a different story haha) Even when I'm at someone's house (friends or family), I constantly worry if I'm using too much of something or I'm being untidy  or if my sitting position is getting in the way of people's comfort. Just always feel like I'm a 'hassle' to everyone. :))"
CasualPH,fq5d3jy,t3_ggupt9,1589100788.0,"Hi OP, totally on your side. It's hard to keep making the effort to make someone feel special when all they do is disregard it or belittle it. Comments like your mom's don't just come out randomly and rarely, they're usually woven into the person's character (not just as a mom but as a person). I think people have this image of mothers being unconditionally loving hence we children are expected to do the same. Unless you've personally grown up with a toxic narcissistic mother, you won't know how it feels, and how it affects our self worth. Respect begets respect. Parents sometimes think that they own their children and can treat them however they want because of the 'utang na loob' curse. While I know being a parent is no easy feat, it does not give you the right to be hurtful, disrespectful, insulting, etc towards your children. There are some AMAZING mothers out there and kudos to them, but let's not kid ourselves and say that all mothers are. Best thing we can do is learn from our parents' mistakes and if we do decide to have kids, show them that while no one, not even moms, are perfect, there is still no excuse for bad behavior."
ukvisa,fltovna,t3_fr35jh,1585482029.0,"Hi! Thank you so much for initiating this! I'm in the same boat. I've done my bio and not sure how long til decision is made. 

Here's my timeline:

Country of application: Philippines (VFS Manila)

Application type: First spouse settlement visa (Priority) 

Biometrics: 16/03/2020

Application received in UKVI: 18/03/2020

Original timeline: 30WD 

Decision made: No update (though I'm only on my 9th WD) 

I got my bio in just before they closed down the visa centers in my country. There's no news of Home Office cancelling ongoing applications but our timelines will definitely take a hit due to the lockdown and reduced manpower. 

I also suggest joining a Facebook group called UK SPOUSE SETTLEMENT VISA. Loads of updated information and timeline there."
ukvisa,fld6pd7,t1_fkwv05y,1585057908.0,The Standard spouse settlement visa takes 60 WD while Priority takes 30 working days. Settlement visas (esp the first one) take the longest because a lot of documents and checks are involved.
ukvisa,fld6bpu,t3_fkzrrz,1585057645.0,"Visa: Spouse Settlement Visa. 
Country: Philippines. 
Application: March 14, 2020. 
Biometrics: March 16, 2020. 
Service: Priority

Got lucky and did my bio a day before all visa centers in my city closed down. Just monitoring Sheffield UKVI and hoping they don't halt operations too. I know a lot of people are worried about their vignette transfers and travel dates. Me and my husband just want to get approved first, fingers crossed. Just sad because prior the lockdown, everyone on priority was getting approved in 10-15 WD. Hoping ours don't take too long either as we've been waiting for almost 5 years for this visa.

Good luck to us all xx"
ukvisa,fld57rz,t1_flb8vk2,1585056848.0,"Awwww I'm sorry to hear that. I hope the head office releases a statement about this soon coz more than the applications pending or getting cancelled, it's the lack of direction and advice that's getting to us. Hang in there"
ukvisa,flaz8dx,t1_flaxqm6,1584994128.0,"Thank you for the details. It seems as though this is happening mainly to US applicants. Not sure if its just the first wave and other countries will follow.

Do you know if your application gets sent to the UK for processing and decision making? Or the New York has its own decision making visa center? 

Just a thought, maybe that's why the applications in the US are being returned coz no one is left to process them. As opposed to other countries where UK is the one doing it (Sheffield visa center is still operational). Pardon my ignorance if this is not the case. 

Hoping all visa services are restored soon esp now when it's most important to be with our loved ones."

I applied from the Philippines and did my bio on March 16th before all visa centers closed down here. I received an email stating Sheffield has received my application. I thought that was reassuring that they'll keep processing the visa in the UK visa center. I guess there's no guarantee now"

It's gotten better twice in the past ten days (esp when i turned off social media) but now it's back to hard breathing again. Awww you think so? I really wanna get tested too but in our country I won't be prioritized. Not knowing what to do is just making it worse. Thank you so much for your response"

raisedbynarcissists,ferzcz4,t3_epw4io,1579359897.0,"Reading your story reminds me so much of my own. I am also in my 20s about to leave my 6yo brother because I'm finally moving into a new home with my husband. My heart breaks every time I see my Nmom treat him the same way she used to treat me. 

Yelling at him and hitting him nonstop when he can't sleep right away (though he does try), telling him to stop talking all the time when he's just being chatty and adorable, telling him to stop crying when she's hitting him, making him go out in the dark at night, locking him out of the main door, always telling him she regrets adopting him and that she is stuck at home taking care of him and not living the life she wants to because of him (even though she has a maid and a profitable business that she handles from home). I honestly feel like she only adopted because she wants someone to take care of her in the future coz she knows she and I have a rocky relationship. She has zero patience with him, she gets angry and annoyed easily and will go through everything that annoys her even though its not the topic being discussed. 

My dad and I can't interfere because then she turns to us and enumerates all our past mistakes and saying if my brother grows up a certain way, it'll be our fault. I do feel helpless but I shower him with love and affection and put him aside and have a heart to heart with him. Asking him how he feels, and reassuring him that we all love him and he can always come to me when he's sad or upset about anything. When he's being rushed I tell him to take his time and that it's okay to think things through. I make him make his own decisions, what to wear, what to eat, what drawings to draw or colors to use. I feel guilty for this sometimes but I do tell him that nmom has a problem with her attitude and she's like that with everybody and not just with him. I go through what happened and tell him this is how we could have handled that situation. No yelling or mean words. 

I know it's really tough to leave someone we love behind knowing we can't protect them anymore but children are soooo resilient and strong. We made it didn't we? So will they. And they have us to support them all the way."
beautytalkph,fdt9lm0,t3_ekx0kr,1578713712.0,I was prescribed Cybelle for PCOS and it's had no side effects for me. :)
beautytalkph,fdgwakg,t1_fddw4a3,1578409911.0,"Girl, we're exactly on the same boat. I was so careful with my skin, and I was confident going out without any makeup. I think I just feel betrayed because you're right, she should have been more transparent with the downtime. 4-5 days is waaay different from 4-5 weeks. I would really be enraged if my skin doesn't go back to its old form. Tbh I'm not trusting of pictures coz they can easily be edited and the lighting is always different. 

Same! Also upon closer inspection, some of my obvious scars were missed. The skeptic in me thinks they do it on purpose so you keep going back to them.

I added azelaic acid and glycolic toner from The Ordinary to my skincare regimen to speed up the lightening process. So far nakakalambot naman ng skin, can't speak for brightening power yet. 

Ahhh thanks for explaining! Sana hindi na lang ako nag PRFM, that's 25k I could have spent on a more effective treatment. I'll let you know how my Laser Genesis goes! Update mo din ako sis sa results of your subcision! I do feel a little better na may karamay ako hehe. Good luck to us! :)"
beautytalkph,fdgsmvs,t1_fdfvh8z,1578407286.0,"She will recommend the best treatments for you but ultimately it's upto you to decide which treatments you'll avail of. Though do keep in mind that it's still a business so the recommendations are geared towards the expensive side. I felt that the TCA was pricey for 10k considering the skin surface covered wasn't the first lot (and you can actually do this yourself at home). Also the PRFM at 25k is pricey but given that this is slightly new in the Phils, I understand why it is priced that way. 

I read good reviews so I trusted her. I just wasn't informed that I would have to deal with fresh red hyperpigmentation all over my face for at least 4 weeks (I'm almost 2 weeks post treatment and the subcised scars still look red). If it's worth it? I'll have to see in the next three months coz collagen production takes time, and I'll be doing other laser treatments with a different clinic too (don't expect this first stage of her treatment to be the final solution to your scars).  If you're getting this done, make sure you're not attending a special event within the next month but if you're not self-conscious like me, then go for it!"
beautytalkph,fddvb34,t1_fdduwsl,1578324859.0,Yes that's true! I have recently started putting on more make up to cover up red scars but I end up looking even worse. I'll try your tip of putting very light layers. Eventually I hope I get to that level of not caring about my scars anymore. Thanks for the makeup recos!
beautytalkph,fdduub6,t1_fddt6x5,1578324532.0,"Awwwwww I feel you sis. Having suffered from acne, my number one priority talaga is to have acne-free skin, which I have achieved more or less. I was ready to take it to the next level, that's why I availed of their subcision. She said there would be a 4-5 day downtime so I expected my skin to go back to normal in a week. When I contacted Doc again, she said the hyperpigmentation will last for another 3-4 weeks but my gut tells me it will be more than that. I'm already thinking of doing Laser Genesis coz it's good for redness, pores and scarring daw, only 2.5k per session, I don't mind going weekly for their 5+3 session promo (it's a derma clinic in Ortigas). May February trip din ako so I'm really bummed that I have to walk around with red spots again (the trauma of my acne past coming back huhu). I'm meant to do Infini and PicoSure after pero after this incident, I might not anymore. But do let me know how your Vbeam goes! I might consider it! 

Ahhh my understanding was that the injected PRFM serves as a filler too (so the scars don't sink back) but it doesn't dissolve like the typical filler which only lasts upto a year. The PRFM is meant to regenerate the skin and induce collage production. Tapos PRP is something applied topically on the skin after the treatment for faster healing. I could be wrong though! 

The minor lumps are still there mostly under my bigger box scars so I'm hoping that's just the PRFM working it's magic and sana hindi bumalik sa dati. Though you're right, collagen production takes time. So I'm trying hard to be patient and hope I didn't spend all that money for nothing haha 

Thanks for the makeup tip! Sighs, akala ko foundation free na ako!"
beautytalkph,fdds3sv,t1_fcvxil1,1578322539.0,"Yes they are optional. You pay for them every visit (paying for the whole package would literally cost hundreds of thousands). With the first stage, the scars will resurface. Esp the box scars will be untethered. But to smooth out the edges and to boost collagen production, they'll recommend the Infini. And lastly for the hyperpigmentation, PicoSure."
beautytalkph,fddqo43,t1_fddalsv,1578321417.0,"Hi sis! I just had the exact same treatment 10 days ago. Though I was not expecting the hyperpigmentation to be this noticeable. I was quite depressed that my clear skin is now spotty again (red spots and lumps where she performed the subcision and PRFM). I have box and ice pick scars but my skin was clear and even toned prior treatment. 

How are you healing and dealing with the hyperpigmentation? May I know if you had PRP done instead of PRFM? The latter was about 25k. Thank you!"
beautytalkph,fctotud,t1_fctdj2m,1577951993.0,"Yes that's the one I had. First stage (Subcision + TCA cross + PRFM), all done in one day. Probably took 4 hrs coz they put numbing cream on you twice. I am undecided if I wanna avail the Second Stage (Infini) and Third Stage (PicoSure). I would say my scars are moderate. I would suggest taking some pain meds before the procedure coz the numbing cream isn't enough. Also, they'll make you drink lots of water before the PRFM cos it involves taking your blood. And there's an aftercare kit worth P3k+"

There are some spots that are still lumpy/swollen, that's probably the PRFM working underneath my skin. I'm not expecting results right away. Just waiting for my skin to clear up again. Results are meant to progress over time, several months even. What I had done wasn't a laser treatment, so it's definitely gonna take time for my skin to heal and reconstruct itself. Will keep you posted sis"
