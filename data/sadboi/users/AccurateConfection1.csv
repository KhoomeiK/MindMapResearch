AmItheAsshole,fqfw37g,t3_gih4et,1589332845.0,"Absolutely YTA. I know you may love that dog, but it is not yours.

This woman lost everything, and all you can think about is yourself. I know it is going to be hard, but there are many lovely dogs in the shelter that ACTUALLY need to be rescued/ need a home.

Dogs remember their owners, and I guarantee it will be so so excited to see her again. 

Send it home to where it really belongs."
AmItheAsshole,fqe73zc,t1_fqe6otu,1589302825.0,Ahhhhhh gotcha
AmItheAsshole,fqdnwv4,t1_fqcto90,1589293451.0,"I think business has to go on, and I get 100% why they replaced her (it sounds reasonable to me).

I lost my son, and I was diagnosed with PTSD from it. Looking at this kind of loss as something you can ""push past"" isn't healthy at all. 

I really kind of resent that kind of comment. I hear that kind of shit alot when it comes to how I live post loss, how I live with PTSD, and when it comes to having more kids."
AmItheAsshole,fqdlldi,t1_fqd9xs6,1589292189.0,"I'm confused. Where does it say anything about ""his dad's dick in her mouth""? I didn't get that at all."
ptsd,fq7nn7k,t1_fq7bsr5,1589148823.0,Awesome tip on where to get them. Thank you!
ptsd,fq655k6,t1_fq64y4w,1589124703.0,"I'll have to check it out, usually I make my husband hug me/squeeze me tightly, so it sounds up my alley. Thank you!"
ptsd,fq61xqb,t1_fq6127x,1589122784.0,Do you just pop it on in hard moments or what? (If that isn't too personal).
ptsd,fq603m4,t3_gh1rhw,1589121646.0,All the time.
AmItheAsshole,fpwpvh0,t3_gftdy6,1588967795.0,"NTA, I feel like the youngest being able to do things/getting things sooner is a common occurrence since you learn as you go with parenting. 

It sounds like your youngest also took time to figure out a solid action plan, and explore the safety of entering the space and educate you. Also, YouTube has evolved a fair amount in 5 years. 

Maybe instead of saying no you could of taken the time to explore and learn from the platform yourself, but hey mistakes happen (especially as a parent). You were doing your best as a parent, and that is all we can do.

If you think it is appropriate you could just own up to that ""mistake"" to your daughter. It may help to mend. Kids tend to appreciate when parents take the time to say they were wrong.

Edit: fixing formatting/adding on last small part."
babyloss,fpwdw7o,t3_gfwiha,1588961732.0,"I can feel this with you. Cried reading this. It will never not hurt, you will never not miss your beautiful baby. For me, over time I forced myself to go out and see people, otherwise I would of never left my house again.

Everyday is a different amount of struggle. Some days I think of my son, and I am just missing him and feeling love and appreciation. Some days I sob in my husband's arms. I can say not a day goes by he isn't on me mind in some capacity.

I am so sorry for your loss, and I can so identify with your pain. It may be hard, but never blame yourself. It wasn't that you couldn't keep her safe enough, or that you couldn't protect her. Terrible, terrible shit happens sometimes, for no reason in the fucking world. 

Take this time to hold eachother tight, and grieve however you two need."
ptsd,fpuo9a0,t3_gfjx1x,1588918399.0,Brought tears to my eyes. Thank you.
ptsd,fpk42ys,t3_gdtsks,1588687580.0,Don't say it isn't much! Every step is a big deal. Congrats on your improvement!
ptsd,fpcxvzn,t1_fpc58u6,1588515474.0,I try to do that a lot. I do that around most my family except my husband. Kinda unavoidable since he usually has to help or atleast see me pick up the pieces.
babyloss,fp2fvn8,t1_fp26t0c,1588261054.0,"The gentle encouragement is unwanted (by me), but is within the lines of fine. I hate the sentiment that you are being selfish. I think it is pretty selfish to put that on someone in general, but especially when there is a loss/possible trauma involved. When I hear stuff like that it is so hard for me to remind myself people have good intentions. It genuinely is all up to you. 

I just don't really see why people think it is an okay thing to ask. I never really know what the hell to say."
ptsd,fozd4yq,t1_fozbap7,1588188662.0,"I have alot of those too. It can be frustrating and I tend to beat myself up for putting people around me through it and feeling like they are stuck with me just as much as I am. Just try to remember your feelings are 100% valid and okay to have, but also be gentle with yourself. It is something I am trying to learn too."
ptsd,foyzep5,t3_ga5na0,1588182002.0,"I tried EMDR on a weekly basis for a while. It didn't really work for me. There is no set time, or schedule for these things. You really have to try it out and see for yourself. I really don't think trauma/PTSD is something you can look at as a thing to treat and be done with."
babyloss,fowe9hx,t1_fowck37,1588118084.0,"The lady from the above store was the lab worker who came to my room to draw blood before my D&C that I had to have from missed birth material (that is a whole other store of awful medical care). Basically, all that to say I totally think there needs to be better trauma informed education for some of these professionals. 

As a side note, my heart goes out to you&your family."
babyloss,fovw4uw,t1_fovnrnf,1588108560.0,"I mean to each either own. I personally struggle with languaging like that, but sometimes I definitely want to say shit to make them uncomfortable on purpose. One woman had the audacity to say I was pregnant with my son ""just long enough to get attached."" I was shocked in the moment and I was in the hospital for a surgery that had to do with my stillbirth.. I wanted to just slap her, or say something real shitty."
ptsd,fotbct8,t3_g9es36,1588049168.0,I relate hard to this. Thanks for sharing‚ù§.
ptsd,fos5h0r,t3_g96fxc,1588024325.0,"I feel like I'm even more triggered than usual because I keep seeing things (media, pictures, fb posts, memes) that pertain to my trauma lol.

Edit: Fixing grammar and typos"
ptsd,folm7f2,t3_g7qupp,1587865284.0,"Lmao I rant about this kind of thing all the time. People around me always just say ""they are trying to be nice and connect with you"" or ""people just don't know how to handle difficult things like what you go through."" Big fucking eyeroll."
AmItheAsshole,folks1c,t3_g7wix2,1587864370.0,"NTA. I lost my unborn son a year ago and it is the hardest thing I have ever gone through. I didn't really talk to anyone aside from my husband, or leave the house unless I had to for a few months. She can fuck herself. If you really want you could possibly see the kid when he is at his grandma's.
I'm very very sorry that happened to you."
ptsd,fojqdu1,t3_g7nsqr,1587827151.0,"I do have a therapist, and my husband is supportive of that. He is a very logic driven person who has a very very hard time seeing emotional things like this. I definitely will ask my therapist to either speak to him, or give maybe give me the break down of how this all works in the brain so that maybe I can explain it better.

The rest of my family doesn't really believe in therapy. They look at me like I'm crazy and cannot relate at all. I tell them things I can't do now like drink alcohol and they still ask me if I can't just have one sip. I think if I can get that language from my therapist though it might help.

Thanks for the suggestions!"
ptsd,foipm4j,t3_g7n8oo,1587793037.0,"Same here. All of this stuff is hard to handle, no one should feel they have to suffer alone or in silence."
