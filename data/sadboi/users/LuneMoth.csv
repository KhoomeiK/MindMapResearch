muacjdiscussion,fr0y2qo,t1_fr0us1v,1589809373.0,I agree with you! It's so much easier to buy makeup than it is clothes.
muacjdiscussion,fr0xzxg,t1_fr0r3c2,1589809325.0,"Maybe it's because makeup is more accessible and affordable (relatively speaking, and of course this not true for everyone)? I mean that it's easier to purchase a high quality brand of makeup than it is to find a high quality item of clothing at a similar price. For example, I'd be willing to pay $50 for a good foundation, but not $50 for a shirt unless it's really high quality, which generally means that shirt would cost more than $50 unless I put a lot of work in and find one at a thrift store! Again, this is my own opinion and maybe I'm unique in being ok with spending more on makeup than I am my clothes. 

 As far as accessibility, you don't have to be a certain size or shape to wear makeup, you just have to have skin. Another thought: there is no way I can afford anything from a designer brand (Chanel, Dior, YSL, ect) *except* for their makeup. I love the glamor of their runway shows, and I dream of going shopping in Paris, but otherwise it's completely inaccessible to me. However, I have a Dior lipstick that I love, and by wearing it I can participate in the larger designer brand."

muacjdiscussion,fqb9tg1,t3_ght7xm,1589233095.0,"Sparkle color phase (middle school): I had some chalky pastel eyeshadows, body glitter (my favorite was purple and grape scented), and lots of bright lipgloss from the drugstore. It was fun!

IDK phase (high school): I only wore a little concealer, mascara and lipgloss for a few years, then later my mom gave me her old foundation (didn't match me at all) and blush. I was pretty happy keeping it natural. I was also involved in theater so I wasn't a stranger to thick pancake makeup!

Put together-ish (early college): as a graduation present, my mom took me to Ulta for a makeup consultation. I left with foundation that actually matched, a new appreciation for Urban Decay single shadows, and instructions on how to put it all on. It was still really basic, but I had some fun green and pink eye shadows now.

Hello, Sephora (late college/grad school): during a summer internship I discovered Sephora, Birchbox, and online ordering. I started buying and experimenting with eyeliner, lipstick, and eyeshadow palettes. I discovered Reddit and the makeup communities here. I also developed a shopping addiction and spent way too much money on stuff I didn't need. I did have fun learning how to do a smokey eye, and I fell in love with colorful eyeliner. I didn't experiment very much with my basic look, but I learned a lot of techniques!

Professional (got a real job): A few weeks before I started working, I made an appointment at Sephora with a makeup artist. She kitted me out with what I needed to look (and feel) put together without being too heavy, and I kept the same routine for a few years. It wasn't anything special, but I liked it!

Eh, whatever (currently): I'm now a stay at home mom of a 6 month old. Makeup is limited to brushing my eyebrows into place and putting on mascara when I have errands to run. I got rid of a lot of stuff when I stopped working, simply because I don't have a place for it anymore. I do like pulling out an eyeshadow pallette for special occasions, and I still wear my colorful eyeliner on dates and fun outings!"

Another good place to start is the checkbox stickers for making lists. 

I started following inspiration accounts on Instagram, and I got a lot of ideas that way of how to use my planner and how to decorate it, but it can be overwhelming! I still struggle with perfectionism - if I can't make my spreads perfect, is it even worth it? But you just gotta go for it and experiment! It's ok if your stickers are crooked, or you mix themes, or it just ends up looking like crap. Play around with white space, with using more stickers, with layering materials and stickers.
