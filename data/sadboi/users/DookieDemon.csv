I've seen a lot of different types. There's all sorts. Craziest job I ever had, no doubt.

Hygiene and like normal human behavior, I came to learn, are not so very universal concepts.

If I had to sort of break it down, I'd say maybe 10% are like definitely awful in some way. Maybe 40% were ugly lazy slobs with no initiative and kind of just guys that never really became men, very often unskilled and uneducated, sadly. Children, really.

Then maybe 30% had debilitating mental health issues. I guess I would fall in the last 20%, which would be guys that at were at one point pretty together but for whatever reason it fell apart and they mostly needed structure and purpose.

I would totally not recommend putting them into hotels unless they have been vetted and show some degree of competency. Otherwise it would be a flophouse in no time. Most of them need serious supervision. No joke, it's like daycare with a lot of them.

And you for damn sure would not want to let them bring anything they own in there. I'm serious, I've seen bedbugs falling out of books. Laptops even.

I feel for the homeless because I've been homeless for long periods, but remember that there's a lot of them that are homeless for a reason and simply putting them in a box with a bed solves nothing.

They really need to expand group homes and such, but ever since Reagan it's be a total nightmare.

Edit:

When I mean ugly, lazy, slobs I don't mean that they are necessarily bad people. Some of my friends were in that category. But it's guys that can't hack it doing menial work, but they are also unable to advance their careers due to legal problems, debt, whatever.

dxm,fpd2x22,t3_gcmxr4,1588518704.0,"This quarantine shit has been fucking with a lot of people's sobriety I'm sure. 

I had been clean from booze for just over a year and then went on a 3 day bender in mid-April. It wasn't even like a really bad bender either, but damn I felt so sick after I stopped. I felt hungover for like 3 or 4 days. 

Once I got it out of my system I felt better and I'm not really feeling tempted to try it again. Which I'm happy about, but I still take DXM way too often. Dex is a helluva drug, but for me it's not nearly as destructive as alcohol. 

Besides making me feel somewhat retarded at times I haven't really noticed any health problems. Generally, if I stop then my mental faculties seem to come back relatively quickly. But when I'm on a dex kick my ability remember things gets pretty fucked, so I tend to leave notes for myself and take lots of pictures with my phone so I can kind of reconstruct everything later. 

I bought a shroom kit and I'm getting some spores so I'm hoping to have something different here in awhile. It sucks that I feel like it's necessary to be fucked on something all the time, but after doing some self-reflection, I think I can say that I need something to kind of derail my regular thoughts. I tend to get stuck in these existential crises and everything in life just feels so artificial and fake. I honestly don't know how most people are able to just focus on the mundane activities of life when really none of us knows what's really the point of it all. Why are we here, why should anything exist in the first place. 

I suppose many people use religion as a sort of guide that keeps them grounded and allows them to function, but to me that seems like why religions sprang up in the first place. It helped keep people from going crazy about the basic meaning of life and the nature of reality. That's why I think religion is entirely a human construct, it's just like a bunch of children lost in the woods alone telling stories to each other to keep from being afraid. 

So, I'm just sort of existing for the moment, hoping that eventually something comes along that makes all this makes sense and I can maybe stop blasting my brain with random chemicals. Curiosity I guess.

In the mean time, I suppose we just have to keep keeping on and fighting the good fight and all that nonsense. 

Anyway, I glad you shared your experience with this sub, I think it's a valuable perspective and will hopefully serve a reminder to all dextronauts, cadets and veterans alike, that moderation is always key and that we are playing with a powerful chemical here."

California is an economic powerhouse in its own right, the [5th largest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_sovereign_states_by_GDP)! Stacked against countries, the GPD of California is larger than the whole of the United Kingdom. More than even India...

If you take out NY and LA, you've just removed the two largest cities in the United States. If somehow you get the Great Lakes states on board then you've also got Chicago. That's the 3 largest cities in the entire US. About one third of the entire US population of roughly 330 million.

To dismiss the possibility of these regions unifying further in other matters, beyond the epidemic, and seceding from the Union is very short-sighted indeed. 

These interstate Covid-19 accords are very significant and will be the subject of many debates. If the executive branch tries to double down on this 'absolute authority' phrase that's been bandied about, then you might find that resolve of these coastal states is equally inflamed, especially if this epidemic continues or, god forbid, worsens in the coming months/years.

Personally, I hope it DOES NOT come to the dissolution of the US, but I feel that these regions are also obligated to protect their residents, both in the face of this disease and 'absolute authority' (aka, tyranny)."

It would be the reverse of the Civil War. It would be the wealthy, more liberal, ""Northern"" states leaving the Union.

This would leave the remaining parts of the country to fend for themselves. And if anything they would be begging for them to come back (so they could start paying for their highways, schools, and defense again).

Mark my words, if that dickhead Trump wants to try to push his weight around with the Blue states, they are going to push back even harder.

As for whether this secession would be good for things in general is hard to say, but currently all this country does is bicker about dumb shit like abortion and Mexican walls. So maybe everyone would be better off if all the Red states can finally become what they've always wanted; a poorly funded totalitarian state, an enclave for the callous and wealthy."

AskOldPeople,fnkpkmd,t1_fnkoal7,1587035973.0,"Definitely made a difference. Beyond that they also restricted quite a bit who could be in the cockpit.

My FIL was a senior air traffic controller that handled regional ATC. He used to be able to fly just about anywhere for free by riding in the cockpit jumpseat. It was ostensibly for training and to help build rapport with pilots. After 9/11 they clamped down on that pretty hard. He ended up retiring not too many years after that.

More recently they have relaxed that restriction so you might occasionally see someone in plainclothes heading into the cockpit before a flight. I suppose the DHS figured the risk was worth the reward.

My sister's husband is currently an ATC, although for a much smaller region. I'm not sure if he ever takes rides in the jumpseat though."

AskOldPeople,fnk9kya,t1_fnk8by1,1587019226.0,"MMmmno, that statement is not true at all. In fact, plane hijackings used to be terribly common. [So common that the FAA in the 60's wanted to build a fake airport in Florida to trick hijackers into thinking they had made it into Cuba, where many of these people wanted to go for some reason.](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/skyjacking/)

>When the government started to oversee aviation in 1958, hijacking wasn’t technically a crime and the early design of airport terminals reflected this. Airports were once more like train stations, where you walk through the terminal and onto the tarmac, and sometimes straight onto the plane itself, without flashing a ticket or showing anyone your identification.  
>  
>Then in 1961, an epidemic of hijackings began.  
>  
>The first wave of hijackers all wanted passage to Cuba. May 1st, 1961 was the first American hijacking, perpetrated by Antulio Ramirez Ortiz, an electrician in Miami. Ramirez got on a Key West-bound flight, held a knife to the pilot’s throat, and announced that he had been hired to assassinate Fidel Castro, and wanted to go to Havana to warn him.

Some people might argue that the new security measures put in place after 9/11 were only for security theater, but even a lot of these new measures were put into place after subsequent (attempted mostly) terror attacks (remember the shoe bomber?).

I don't really fly very often, so it's not a huge inconvenience for me. If was worried about the government keep tabs on my travel I would just drive places. **You've probably got a phone in your pocket that's keeping excellent tabs on you, so if the government wanted to know anything about you they wouldn't need airport security to do it.**"

That's pretty heavy coming from someone from India. I'm guessing you or your buddies are here on an H1B and I struck a nerve, judging by your comment history anyway. 

We both know that American programmers and IT specialists are way better than what India produces, I think it's clear that we agree on that. 

But since capitalism is a greedy system foreigners can come here and get paid $15 an hour to program instead of getting a real wage. 

If these companies were required to pay foreign nationals what they pay American Citizens and Permanent Residents then I wouldn't be so apprehensive about the H1B program, but as it stands now it's just become a loophole for corporations to spend less on payroll."
