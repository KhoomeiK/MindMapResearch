POTS,fncwov2,t3_g0ocjx,1586849827.0,"yes i have experienced this quite often, but just figured this was associated with a psychological illness, like anxiety. I will literally be in public and any sudden loud noises makes me jump so bad. No idea why."
BPD,fn1pevc,t3_fyh7we,1586567053.0,"definitely can feel for ya. i experience this so much. although, what helps my thoughts is that social media is so fake. you’re seeing edited and posed photos. and as for what your friends tell you, they’re likely only gonna talk about the goods like getting a boyfriend or doing something fun. behind closed doors, everyone has their own problems. they just try not to make it seem that way on social media, likely due to humiliation. but i feel the same and still struggle with it to this day."
BPDsupport,fn1lnad,t1_fn15po6,1586564657.0,"as a girlfriend with BPD with a boyfriend who likely feels the same as you, except the opposite with the sex situation (i usually want it and he doesn’t), but i definitely agree with the person above. she is likely hurting, probably more than you. she may even feel as if all you want is sex."
