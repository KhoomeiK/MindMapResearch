He may be thinking of the max range using Vicious strikes, you only need 3 or 4 points into that if I remember correctly. I think that's the only way to max the radius of reflect beams, or at least the only way that isn't impractical."
dungeondefenders,fq75u1n,t3_ggurcw,1589142176.0,"A lot of people have a hero that has all their ascension points for one specific defense. So a monk for flame, a monk for lightning, etc  Also, only using the range gambit and a range mod on the tower relic, and using Vampiric Empowerment instead of Deadly Strikes. Not sure what the DPS comparison for that is, but I remember reading that flame auras can only damage 10 enemies at a time so sometimes maxing out the range with deadly strikes has diminishing returns for that specific defense, but stays useful for say Poison Dart, Earthshatter, Skyguard, and some blockades (if you use em)."
dungeondefenders,fq7268t,t3_gh0p5g,1589140821.0,"I've been encountering that bug in higher level items I've bought from other players, I think it's because there's a glitch that scales the item level down further than the gear values & stats. So yes, it will decrease at first. Maybe hold into it until you AP reset if you want to tinker it. Plus upgrading equipment is really expensive, I think the only time you would wanna do that is if you are done with AP resets."
dungeondefenders,fpherph,t3_gd0pxy,1588619995.0,"I've played DD1, have yet to get into Awakening, but I enjoy DD2 more than I did DD1. I like the variability of onslaught as an endgame grind more than survival pet grinding. The new heroes and their defenses are fun, and instant switching is a nice feature (As I said, I haven't played awakening yet, so I'm not sure if that's in it). 

It's a challenge to try and build higher onslaught without using Automation/tenacity 10 and EV2 defenses, but with elemental combos, mods, and shards there are quite a few non-Meta defenses you can use to push higher (ie PDT and Earthshatter, 2 Splody Ballista with Piercing and different elements, Elemental/Status Ramster, Vipers, etc etc). At high levels when Frost mobs and Headstrong lanes become the norm, waves become extreme Tower gear/mod/shard checks that you Pass with no trouble or just outright Fail, as your Hero can usually only cover one lane at a time. Maybe that's just me, because I don't use blockades, opting to use the DU for damage instead, but I think that's the same for most endgame players.

In terms of P2W/F2P advantages, I think the only serious one is inventory size because those are the only gameplay related item you can't grind the needed currency to buy (and some pets if I recall, but you usually only need a cat with sparkle party or Gato fireworks). That may not be too big a deal if you aren't worried about shard gilding, but I think it can be really annoying, especially if you decide to get into the Ancient Power resets. If you're going to spend any money on the game, bags and then vaults are priority, and the few F2P gems are best spent on the materials vault, just imo. Not sure how long they'll keep the servers up after Awakening's release, so the value for your money spent may not have a long return.

I believe they have stated there are no more content updates planned, but there are some quality of life/glitches I hope they can patch before they cease support eg if they let materials go directly to the vault (if you own it), it would be a godsend. The should also add a Frost/Ice mod for towers, as that would open up some more build variations. On PS4 the Shadowflame Knife stops working on higher onslaught Lost Temple, as does split screen stability around floor 70. Dryad defenses continue to be buggy in terms of targetting and even just sometimes working. (She's fallen off from her glory days, but I still like her as my main builder through prestige grinding). Sometimes Lost Temple mobs get a little wonky and stray from their path.

Try out campaign, that's not too much of a timesink. If you liked it, go through Chaos or Onslaught if you want to see what the game is about, as that's when you start getting the different shards and mods that can really change builds. The game is still pretty active, usually always a full lobby, even more so with most of the world on Lockdown, in my observation anyway. You should be able to easily find other players to do up to Chaos 7 and/or Onslaught 30 with. Finding other people to do Floor 70+, Mastery, or Incursions with can be a bit more difficult, but if you're on the discord it's probably easier to find people to join you.

Sorry for the wall of text, didn't think I would go into that much."
FinalFantasyXII,fopu2ey,t1_fopg7zv,1587972147.0,"Because realistically, in this job combo, Penelo is not going to be using ninja swords for an overwhelming majority of the game. And if she is, it's Yagyuu+Black Robes+Germinas for Yiazmat, or the other rare times when dark, earth, or water might be useful, which is why I like the options. I admit it's for probably less than 5 fights, but still, the status ailments matter even less.

Also Mesa is available not THAT much later than Orochi, and is not difficult to get either as long as you steal abuse Grimalkin before leaving for Feywood. Plus it's not like I'm missing out on significant DPS between then and Feywood by foregoing Orochi. Red Shikari can't even use Maximilian, so at that point she's choosing between light or mystic equipment with tiddlywinks of either STR or SPD boosts, and Sash. Unless you get Exodus as soon as he's available, but even Dragon Armor isn't going to make her ninja blade damage skyrocket, over say Bone of Bylbos which you can also get around the same time as Exodus, along with Golden Skullcaps and Glimmering Robes. (If I'm remembering correctly)

In any case, she's either going to have Main Gauche and shield, or a mace if I really want to auto attack, since she'll be equipped for magic most of the time anyway. Maybe for a different character or job combo I'd bother with Ninja 1, but not for this. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
FinalFantasyXII,foox931,t3_g8kscf,1587948397.0,"I went in with one character, let them get wiped, and switch in with 3 brave, bubbled, hasted beserkers, skipping the barrier phase entirely. I felt kinda dirty by how easy it was. Also helps if you go in with characters that have a prime numbered level to dodge any of the LVL [?] shite he likes casting. Also, I would add Regen, because I remember my White Robe+Excalibur Basch died from the counter damage, and the other two only barely finished before limit break activated."
FinalFantasyXII,foorvhk,t1_foonyjl,1587945147.0,"I think for the most part, the White/Black/Time mage jobs and the Machinist can wait until you unlock the second board. You'll have potions for days, all the female characters start with cure, and Archer will have access to Cura through a quickening, which will be sufficient until you get the second board. Black magic will start to pick up in usefulness around that time as well. Although White can be good to start with if you want to cure status ailments, and revive without items. You also get access to protect and shell earlier if you want them.

For Red Shikari, either one is okay to start, but I'd pick Red for the extra utility, like Cura, Protect, and Shell.

If you do decide to go with Monk Bushi, I'd pick Monk first. They will get lots of Hp with nodes and light armor, and can hit flying enemies with Poles, which also tend to have higher default combo rates and evasion. Bushi is fine to start with as well, but REALLY picks up in endgame. 

For quickenings and Espers, I'll edit some suggestions into my post. 

Also, just three tips I wanted to share, apologies if you already know these, but just make sure you check how to get the Genji equipment. It won't be until probably 75% or so through the main story, but the pieces of it are some of the few permanently missable items. 

And if you're okay with looking up more in depth guides, maybe look up something about trophy hunt loot. Those monsters can be sources of rare loot steals that are otherwise a HUUUGE pain to grind for, and they don't respawn if killed.

And before you really get into the game, maybe a quick google check on how to get monographs. 

Again, sorry if you knew all that. Have fuuuun! üëèüòÅ"
FinalFantasyXII,foohhz7,t3_g8527i,1587939050.0,"Since the update, I've reclassed and currently trying out:

Vaan - Time/Archer

With Zalera, he gets all item lores. Heavy armor to support bow damage (without the use of an Esper), and time/green magic support. Nice ranged DPS with focus which is easy to maintain, and backup item chucking.

~

Balthier - Black Knight

With Hashmal and Mateus for extra White Magic, he is a nice backup Red Mage. Usually always has White Robes and Magepower Shishak at end game, so in between smashing things with Excalibur, his heals and occasional offensive spells are pretty strong. Also good for chucking out sleepgas if Penelo isn't on the team. No swiftness 3, but if you're using him for Excalibur OHKO, berserk makes it negligible, and spell animation time is a bigger hindrance for black magic.

~

Fran - White Foebreaker

With Ultima for swiftness 3. Nice paladin type of character. Highest vitality makes her the best breaker when you need them to connect, and vit is also used in Hammer/Axe damage. Been using her as lead when not using Penelo.

~

Basch - Monk Bushi

Fastest Katana attack speed, and only slightly slower animation speed with Poles than Fran. The magic lores of Bushi compliment the white magic unlocks for Monk, and the battle lores from Monk open up equipment options if you're trying to reach 99 str/mag with Bushi without Zeromus. A good choice for Zodiark (Renew and Heavy Armor/Magepower Shishak). I also usually give the Monk the Chaos Esper, because I like having as many sources of Protecta and Shellga as I can.

~

Ashe - Uhlan Machinist

A good beserkbot that can hit every element. Focus and Adrenaline from Uhlan powers up guns. Famfrit for another source of Hastega in endgame if you don't want to farm motes. Also good for item gambits.

EDIT - Side note: From a 'lore' perspective, I think I would have preferred her to be the Black Knight, but Baltheir is slowest with ranged weapons. If you're just mashing things with spears, and don't even use guns, this won't matter.

~

Penelo - Red Shikari

My fave lead. Opens fights with mobs by casting sleepga, allowing for quick clearing, and tanks with decoy, main gauche, and shields. Can also re-equip for ninja blade DPS (Tied with Baltheir and Basch for fastest attack speed). Cuchulainn and Shemazai for tons of extra spells and a backup gun user. 

A suggestion, ditch Ninja Blade 1 from the quickenings, and pick the others for elemental coverage. Daggers and maces will put in the same work as those first blades, and you only miss Vox and Poisona on the RedM board, which don't matter; You'll always have Echo Herbs and Antidotes, and eventually Esuna with Shemhazai. 

~

My reasoning for these was to make sure to use every job, that there was no overlap between armor types, and to have as much utility for each character as possible. The only one who is kind of one note is Fran, but I think that tends to happen with any White Mage pairing, so I figured I'd just give her breaks and more tankyness.

When I get the second Genji gloves, I may switch it up again, and go with Foebreaker Monk for Fran, Uhlan Bushi for Basch, and White Machinist for Ashe."

Anxiety,fmdduf7,t3_fj2y1a,1585965347.0,"I just wanted to share a personal story. A week ago, a relative of mine posted that her husband had been admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to COVID-19 which he later tested positive for, and she had started developing symptoms of. Both are in their fifties. The doctors were worried he would need to be put on a ventilator as his O2 was dipping to 90 and below even with an oxygen tube, but kept a close eye on him. 

3 days ago, she shared that his fever was breaking and his O2 was stabilizing. 

2 days ago, she shared that her cough had improved and the worst she was dealing with was a sore throat. 

Yesterday, he was being weaned off oxygen. 

Today, he was discharged, and is back at home! They were directed to stay self quarantined for a month, and also advised to stay away from each other as best they can for about a week (Opposite ends of the house I guess). After the month, they'll be tested again. A lot of friends and family offered to do any grocery and supply shopping for them to make this time easy, and things have turned around for the best. 

It was stressful to witness the daily updates, as they are the first people I personally know who contracted the virus. But now I feel so much better.

Then everyone gets what they wanted, AeJon on the throne, but his rule is forever tainted:

-Dorne is the first to fully secede because of Rhaegar dishonoring Elia and their children by annulling the marriage, and will never be ruled by his son.

-Iron Islands follow suit and start to expand, beginning with the now abandoned Dragonstone.

-Sansa stays mad because the North stays loyal to the King they chose. 

-With the exception of Tyrion and Gendry, The Southern lords and common folk never fully trust Jon because of his lineage and also the blood that was spilled because of Robert's Rebellion being built on lie.

-Rest of the regions split one after the other, and Westeros truly becomes the 7 kingdoms again.

-Jon returns to Winterfell and Sansa continues to seethe because a Targaryen is King in da Norf.

-Dany begins a new Valyrian empire centered in Slaver's/Dragon's Bay, but never has peace of mind, because of her burning of Kings Landing and the deaths of the people that followed her to Westeros for what amounted to nothing but her own revenge. She never has children, but Drogon lays eggs.
