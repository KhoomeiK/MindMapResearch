As difficult as it may be you should let him go..focus on yourself..find a hobby..go out with friends..anything to distract you from him to make it easier...and if you're comfortable enough to tell his family you should."
ToxicRelationships,fl6lb8i,t3_fmuvpz,1584874110.0,"Don't beat yourself up..& believe me..you ARE strong..you've probably just invested all your time in him that you can't imagine a life without him..I know exactly what you're going thru..and you're absolutely right..unfortunately NOTHING will change..but because we're so blinded by what we think is ""love"" we chose to remain hopeful..and keep telling ourselves that there will be change or that things will get better..because WE want it to be that way but don't lose yourself in that process. If it's gotten to that point where its abusive..as hard as it might be..it's best to just leave..I suggest making friends or finding a new hobby to get a distraction from him..so that you're not so invested and then it won't be as difficult...but if you chose to stay then that's also fine..because at the end of the day..it's your happiness..but just know you're not alone. Much love."

If he has to hide things from you or be dishonest about things..that's also another red flag..dump him..and work on your confidence, you sound insecure."
