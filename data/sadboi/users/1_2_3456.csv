The counciler asked me if I wanted to be friends with again I said yes, and they said no, so I said to the counciler that I will ignore their existence, because they are dead to me from then on, but fast forward to high school they were in my same math class, and I passed it it was a easy class, and I didn't pay attention that much only to some things I didn't understand, everyone passed except those two. To be safe from then I took my math class that I was supposed to take in sophomore year in summer school, now I am glad that I did, but it only just started to get better for me
