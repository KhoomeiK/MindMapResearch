BabyBumps,fm7j4pf,t3_ftgds1,1585828762.0,"Oh wow, thank you for sharing and I’m glad you and baby are ok now! I got appendicitis at 34 weeks with my first baby, and my symptoms were also super weird. I just felt like I had a bad cold, loss of energy and appetite, and I couldn’t stand up straight. I had upper right quadrant tightness that wasn’t even pain, just very uncomfortable because it was so tight. I really thought baby was just growing too fast for my ligaments to stretch!

Finally I just felt sick enough that I went in to L&D and they did a ton of imaging where they saw the inflamed appendix. My appendix had in fact ruptured, and I ended up with post-op chorioamnionitis, putting baby in danger, and severe sepsis, putting us both in danger. I eventually went into labor at 36 weeks as my organs were failing and baby just needed to get out. It was a total nightmare and we both could have died. Baby had a 0 Apgar score when she was born and needed 72 hours of cooling to preserve her brain and organs. She’s now a perfectly healthy three year old, and I got away from the ordeal with only minor scarring on my kidneys and infertility (had to go through IVF for baby #2). 

So yeah, do not let your appendix rupture!! If you’re feeling sick and something doesn’t seem right, go in early, don’t just assume you have a cold (loss of appetite is not a typical cold symptom, so that should have been a red flag for me)."

Potty training felt like all we were doing from 27 until 32 months when things finally started to click. That’s five months of cleaning up pee from the floor, y’all.

As long as I have my baby with me, I'll be happy enough. 

I didn't get to hold my first baby for six days after her birth, and it suuuuucked, but she's turned out fine and we had absolutely no trouble bonding. So I don't know how much I believe that ""magic hour"" idea, like if you can't hold your baby within the first hour of life, they won't bond as well. I did not find that to be true at all. So while I'll feel sad for my husband for not getting to be there, I don't think there will be long term consequences.

asexuality,fibyff5,t3_f7ja7k,1582333111.0,"You're not alone in struggling with this! I also started my ace journey thinking that my only problem was medical, but then I solved the medical side of the equation. But sex was still a horrible experience for me. Everything about it felt wrong. Then I thought maybe I was traumatized. Like seriously traumatized. I would go into a full blown panic when things turned sexual in a relationship. But I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the trauma was. I hadn't been raped. Should I trust my gut, which was telling me in a thousand different ways that I wasn't a sexual person? Or should I doubt everything and become weighed down by the thought that I had been raped while unconscious at some point in my past and had no memory of the event? Ultimately, does it really matter? 

After many years of internal turmoil, I have decided that it doesn't matter **why** I am asexual. If there was some event in my past, or if it's just genetics and environment, it is what it is. All that matters now is that that is who I really and truly am, and I owe it to myself and everyone I love to be my authentic self and to communicate my needs accurately. 

Will I hurt people? Probably. But think of it this way: if a gay man rejects the sexual advances of a straight woman, do we blame the gay man? No. He's just gay. We don't expect him to perform such an intimate act with a woman he's not attracted to. So why blame asexuals who don't desire anyone? People get hurt in relationships all the time. It's just human nature. People want different things. Some people are ""vanilla"" in bed, other people have very specific sexual fantasies that their partners may not be into. It happens to allosexuals all the time. 

If you've hurt people in the past because you weren't sure how to communicate what you wanted in a relationship (totally not your fault by the way - society places so many expectations on everyone, allo and ace alike) that's OK. You can forgive yourself and just make the commitment right now going forward to communicate to the best of your understanding. 

I believe asexuality can be a joyful experience, and one that can force you to expand your concept of what a beautiful relationship can be, and make you more accepting of others who don't fit the mold. Ultimately, making you a more empathetic person. Should you choose to accept that quest! You can explore asexuality and all it has to offer (it's not just an absence of sex) and if it's not your thing, then you'll know. Good luck!"
asexuality,fi90f53,t3_f71hxz,1582252601.0,"Yes! I recently had to take a medication that increased my libido (it increases blood flow in general.... including to the genitals) and I had a minor identity crisis thinking that I'd lose my asexuality. Nope. Still zero desire to bang. It just made driving very arousing! In a pretty annoying way actually, even though it was a bit fun at first. Kinda glad I don't have to take those meds anymore (L-arginine, in case anyone is curious or wants to experiment)."
Parenting,fh1hfzf,t3_f0wgk9,1581215541.0,"You are not alone! Our stories are so similar. The birth of my first was a total nightmare. I had severe sepsis from an infection in my uterus, and baby was born early 36 weeks. She suffered a birth injury due to lack of oxygen and spent 2 weeks in the NICU while I spent a week in the ICU. I didn't even get to see her until she was 7 days old. We both could have died, and I also ended up with a 3rd degree tear and some PTSD. 

Therapy has helped so much! I am now in a position of mental strength and resilience. And yet there is no universe in which I would ever go through natural child birth again when there is another option. I don't see it as ""the easy way out"". While PTSD no longer effects my daily life, being in labor is not ""daily life"". It is pushing your body and mind to the absolute limits. While I have trained my mind to cope with a huge array of challenges without breaking, my body remembers things and has a ""mind"" of its own, and ultimately the body is the one in control during labor. Mind plays second fiddle if anything. 

So if during a natural labor my body decides it's in danger, it will fight. I will be out of control. That's not safe for baby. I'd have to be sedated. My poor long-suffering husband would have to witness his wife screaming bloody murder, and it could trigger him. We could both be sent back to those dark days of 3 years ago when we went through hell. At a time when we should both be focusing on taking care of a newborn, we'd both be reeling.

For me it's about risk mitigation. And mental health is a big component to the risk. I want to be there for my baby (I'm 23 weeks with #2 now) from the start. I want to be the strong, resilient, healed person that I've worked so hard to be, from the beginning. 

Whatever you decide, just know that you will be making the right decision for you and your baby, and that is all that matters! It sounds like you've done a great job informing yourself, researching, doing your therapy. I doubt that you're making a rash or lazy decision. I'm rooting for you! Wishing you a beautiful birth and a fast healing process! <3"

My first was 2.5 years ago and to be honest I’ve felt like things never fully got back in place after that.

productivity,f90s2pi,t3_e33kue,1574976550.0,"Sounds like your average minutes of productivity per day is something like 15-45 minutes. That's a great start! Do you think tracking that would help? I use an app called ""HoursTracker"" on iPhone that is pretty simple and allows me to clock in and clock out many times per day. Even if you only manage one minute at a time, that can add up to maybe a whole hour a day. And seven hours per week. If those are truly productive hours, you could write a short novel in a year! Try to give yourself credit for all the tiny stacks of productivity that you already have in the bag. Look back over what you've accomplished over the weeks or months. And don't ever have a ""zero"" day. Before you go to bed every day, at least get one minute of work done, no matter how hard that is. 

My other suggestion is, do you have a job? It wasn't clear from your post. I'd suggest getting a job. You might think that would leave you with even **less** time for your writing, but I think you'll find the opposite is true. Being busy forces you to focus, and frees you from crippling anxiety. 

I have a very similar problem with being obsessed about productivity, but find it very very hard. Fortunately, I only have to suffer from this angst for four hours a day, because I'm working the rest of the time. So could I cram in the same amount of work as you (15-45 minutes) per day? You bet. I have four whole hours! So I still go to bed disappointed that I didn't use every spare minute, but at least I can be satisfied that I did **something**, on top of my usual day job, and I only had to fret for 4 hours instead of 16. That's much better for my mental health. Overall having even a boring job can lead to feeling better about yourself, and allowing yourself to have regularly scheduled weekends where you truly do ""nothing"" and have no expectations. Breaks are so important. 

Do what you need to do for your mental health first. Then the productivity will follow."

InfertilityBabies,f8tb6bv,t3_e231me,1574799718.0,"Ugh, I had a similar run-around with the receptionist at my OBs office, with them not even wanting to make an appointment with them until I'd been discharged from the RE. Fortunately I was able to get my OB intake appointment within 2 weeks of that, and the cluelessness was only on the part of the front desk. The medical staff all knew a lot about IVF, so I didn't have to do any hand holding there. My RE's office had sent over all of my records from IVF, so I was free from that trouble too. My intake appointment took a long time. One hour just talking with a nurse about my entire medical history up to and including IVF. Then half an hour with the OB to go over the same thing (but in less detail)!

The only thing that differentiates me now from any other non-IVF patient is that I'm going to see an MFM doctor at 20 weeks where, in addition to the normal anatomy scan, they'll also do a fetal echocardiogram and look for signs of spina bifida (I think?). IVF comes with an increased risk of cardiac issues and spina bifida. Other than that, by the time I was with my OB I'd actually been off progesterone and estrogen (since 10 weeks) so they didn't have to manage that aspect. But even if they had, the RE would have given explicit instructions, I imagine.

The other thing I wanted to make sure was that the TSH level range considered optimal by my RE was the same as what my OB would recommend. It was. That was the only case where I trusted the RE to know more about what's best during pregnancy over my OB. Other than that, I feel like I'm in very good hands now. Wishing you the best!"

NICUParents,f5hvh64,t3_dns5s2,1572208351.0,"Welcome to the world Elizabeth Grace! The cooling technology is truly amazing, and can help babies with hypoxia go on to thrive.

It is so hard to watch them being cooled, but you just have to survive those hours as best you can, knowing that long term your daughter is being given a much better chance at a normal life. The fact that she had no more seizure signs overnight is very promising. 

Our daughter also had some questionable EEG signs at birth, but that resolved pretty quickly. She's now a totally typical 2.5 year old. She went through occupational therapy and fully caught up developmentally within 18 months. Your path may not be the same, but I just wanted to let you know that it's possible for a child to overcome even a very rough start. 

Just take care of your family and reach out when you need help. Going through something like this can be so traumatic. Sometimes even more for the fathers. My husband was the only one able to be with our daughter for the first six days, while I was in the ICU.

IVF,f565kfr,t3_dmy4jq,1572018865.0,"First off I just want to say you’re doing all the right things in asking doctors to take your whole medical history into account when developing a treatment plan for you. It’s their job, and should be a totally normal non-judgemental part of their job. 

I also had some mental issues going into IVF treatment (PTSD triggered by operating rooms, and a history of post-anesthesia delirium) but my doctor was completely respectful and accommodating. I got an extra nurse on staff during my procedures just to help calm me down. Plus Valium. 

I was also doing EMDR trauma therapy, and that had helped with my daily life, but nothing really prepares you for being on that table. For me, I knew that having the doctor go slow, and explain what he was doing at every step, and holding a nurses hand, was critical. Think through very carefully (preferably with the help of your therapist) what would help you through the procedures. Write it all out and see if your doctor will be willing to go through it with you.

As for the PIO (replacement for suppositories) those injections have been kinda terrible for me. If you do end up doing PIO every day, you’ll probably want to work closely with the nurses to get the correct needle length, correct injection site and prep. It can be hard to get everything perfect so that PIO isn’t debilitatingly painful, but with persistence I believe it can be done!

But I just started down the path anyway. It’s a loooong path, IVF. So many tests, so many months of waiting. I told myself I can get off this train whenever I want. There were other “signs” telling me to stop too.

What God would frown upon that? It is, in a sense, a very Pro Life way to go, in the true sense of the phrase (not the women-hating sense). Still no regrets so far. Wishing you all the best, no matter what you decide."
toddlers,f47n0xo,t3_djnh32,1571424874.0,"Yes, mine does this too. For loud noises, or even just annoying or unusual noises (like the refrigerator or the dishwasher), cars passing, etc. As long as your child isn't throwing a huge inconsolable tantrum over loud noises, and is able to be in loud environments after some adjustment period, I wouldn't worry. Personally, I'm extremely sensitive to loud noises as well, but what's important is being able to cope with it."

The CS classes were useful if only to get into the mindset of a different field, but a whole undergrad degree would have been overkill. The physics degree was 10x more important because it made me stand out among interviewees and it ended up being somewhat relevant to my first programming job (I did some statistical modeling, and my math skills helped me troubleshoot faster than I could have otherwise)."

My RE did quite percentages for each grade (70-75% for AB, 60-65% for BB, etc) but that’s only for implantation, not live birth rates. I wonder if once you have implantation the grades matter less? That seems odd to me. Also wonder if the grade matters less than how quickly the embryo made it to blast? Like day 5 vs day 7."

If you’re still concerned that this is too much sleep for you, get your thyroid levels checked. Hypothyroidism can cause lethargy and needing more sleep, even at subclinical levels. That is what I had. Without treatment I needed 8.25 hours, after treatment I only need 7.75. It’s only a half hour, but it means I have time for one more thing every day. It adds up over time.

But using your story to promote something aggressively is not a way to build trust and community. It makes the story seem fake even if it’s based in reality. It’s ok to learn from your mistakes, and I hope you do. By posting to many related subreddits, you must know that many people are subscribed to all of them and will see your post pop up many times.

tryingforanother,f25mzos,t3_dc2qy9,1569978643.0,"First of all I am so sorry you went through such a rough pregnancy with your son. It sounds like a true nightmare. But it also sounds like you're taking your mental health seriously and willing to work hard to have a second child. This is all extremely promising, and it is absolutely possible to get to a place of mental strength after going through something traumatic. You are the only person who will know when you're ready. If at any point you think your therapist is wrong, that's up to you, and don't feel like you need the therapist to ""sign off"" on trying again. You know yourself best. 

The thing that helped me get back into a better head space (after nearly dying giving birth to my first) was going through a year of EMDR therapy with a peripartum trauma therapist. It probably wouldn't take that long, but I started therapy when my daughter was one, and I wasn't planning to start trying until 18 months anyway, so I had time. 

The other thing was remembering that I survived, that I'm a surviver. I kinda feel like nothing can take me down because I didn't die, and I kept my baby alive inside me for 36 weeks, which was a damn long time and I'm proud of every day that I kept her inside, even if I couldn't take it to term. Term wasn't the finish line. 36 weeks was, and I made it. So I could stop blaming myself and focus on what I achieved and how much strength it took to get that far. 

Lastly, just remember that anxiety is treatable, and there are medications that are safe to take during pregnancy. If someone tells you ""well, there are risks"" get a second opinion. Your mental health is paramount. Best of luck, however you decide to proceed!"
InfertilityBabies,f25k0r2,t1_f25i5wj,1569976495.0,"Ugh that sucks. No amount of mental preparation can truly help with when the reality hits. I'm sorry for your loss, and that you haven't been able to get in-person support from your wife yet."
InfertilityBabies,f25gp04,t3_dc20ef,1569974076.0,"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Ectopic pregnancies are so scary, and I hope it resolves quickly as a CP. Unfortunately with methotrexate, it can take many weeks before your body is ready to carry a pregnancy again. So it might be a couple cycles if that's the case. (In my experience, methotrexate didn't work and I needed to have the tubal ectopic surgically removed, but my hCG levels were 5,000+, so hopefully that won't happen to you). Wish I had more advice. 

I'm also sorry you've been downvoted on r/infertility. I've gotten downvotes there, and even when I understand the reasons, it can be such a gut punch because posting on there generally means I'm having a shit-tastic day. They are just extremely strict over there about phrasing and content. (I read your post, and it's possible that the issue they have is with fishing for other people's potentially traumatic stories of ectopics when you haven't technically been through one yet, but I'm not 100% sure).

Don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t be happier that you’ve rectified the situation and that your life is better for that. That is wonderful!

I did a FET of one PGS normal embryo so I'm pretty hopeful. I think the anxiety is going to hit later in this pregnancy, as I had a traumatic birth of my first. She was delivered via forceps while I was unconscious and in septic shock resulting from an appendectomy post-op complication. She spent 14 days in the NICU, while I was in the ICU for 6 days. 

I suffered permanent damage to my kidneys and my fallopian tubes due to the sepsis. When we tried for a second child I had an ectopic pregnancy, which lead me to investigate the state of my ""plumbing"" and determined that IVF would be the only option. It's been a long road to get here, 14 months since my ectopic. 2.5 years since myself and my baby almost died. But I'm ready to be here. I think. I suffer from some infrequent bouts of PTSD, but I'm working hard in therapy to keep the anxiety at bay. Looking forward to meeting all the fine people of Infertilitybabies!"

But it just seems like they still randomly hurt like hell. Yesterday I had no pain in the AM after the shot, but then at 3pm the pain started and by 7pm I was in bed writhing in pain and barely slept last night. This is just ridiculous. 

Has anyone switched to the less viscous PIO? I've heard it's more expensive, but at this point I'm almost ready to throw in the towel and bite the bullet cost-wise (as long as it's within reason). So bummed cuz I feel like so many people here are giving themselves their own PIO every day with no complaints (in airports, during board meetings - I swear y'all are so hard core!), and I'm making my husband do mine because I'm a wimp, but even then we're just failing utterly.

Second, the embryo transferred was already hatching, and super ready to implant! From what I’ve read, implantation post FET can be expected after 1-6 days.
