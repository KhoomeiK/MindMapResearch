On reboot they are all just killed, then only maybe one of the 10 containers starts again, the one that was able to be stopped cleanly, or the one that goes down the fastest...it's not always the same one. 

My understanding is that on reboot if the containers are stopped cleanly and set to always restart, they should be brought up again when the docker service starts after reboot.

I'm thinking they aren't being stopped cleanly when I reboot which is why they aren't coming up again. Why they aren't being stopped cleanly by the docker service or systemd is what I can't figure out.

If I just run docker-compose down on each stack via script it takes about 17 seconds to bring the containers down. The rpi shuts down in 10 seconds, so is not doing the same thing as docker-compose down."
