Your body is BEGGING for the high calorie, high nutrition foods that it desperately needs because that‚Äôs what it evolved to do. If you start refeeding and start listening to it, eventually you WILL get past extreme hunger and reach your set point and you will no longer have the same kind of binge urges. This is scientific fact. But it‚Äôs really, really really hard to get there and you may need professional help to do it. If you can‚Äôt right now, try to add some simple fats like peanut butter in your porridge to help keep you alive until you can. Wishing you the best. You do NOT need to be starving and thin to be a worthy, valid person."
