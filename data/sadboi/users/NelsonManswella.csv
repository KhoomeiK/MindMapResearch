A. while my answers are earnest, they’re kinda bland. like yes, it’s a good movie, but the movie is jackie brown.

B. being a photographer, i also think that having quality photos is a pro. i mean, im nowhere near attractive enough to be thought of as a catfish and i can show more personality, use my tripod to get angles, use my flash to get different levels of light, etc. if i spent $1,000+ on a camera, why would i use my iphone 7 to take pictures???

i know my height is a huge disadvantage but i also have low success on tinder where my height isn’t even mentioned, ya know? hence why i asked if it’s something about my face or what lol
