Dogs are great, I credit my little floofer with saving my life."
depression,ew12jxy,t1_ew128nv,1565013521.0,"So flippen typical, rejecting before we get rejected. People only have so much tolerance and then will give up trying for good.

I had a really good patch where I tried with family and friends. It was the happiest I'd been in ages. It was like happiness was my super power and other peoples feelings/actions/words couldnt hurt me. Then I started thinking about my past, how those people had let me down or emotionally abused me and I lost the control of my happiness. Everything, especially the memories affected me and them just down and down from there."
depression,ew126um,t3_cm93au,1565013251.0,"Please go for a walk, come down from the car park, walk to the nearest cafe and buy yourself a tea/coffee/hot chocolate, somewhere with wifi so you can chat here. Please please do that and let me know how you get on. 

You have so much to live for, not just your dog. If you do do this she'll not understsnd why you didnt come home, dont do it for her if you cant go on for yourself."
depression,ew0zr2k,t3_cm9g04,1565011348.0,"Yes, you're not alone!

I think subconsciously my brain thinks thst by being out and about theres more of a chance I can mess up, say something stupid, more to talk about on a Monday morning and generally I've been less ""safe"" by being out at the weekend. A lot of my anxiety comes from fear of judgement from others but that's my thoughts on what is happening behind the scenes in my head."
depression,ew0njd4,t1_ew0n3vt,1564997842.0,"You may not feel self worth but you certainly are worthy, you're thoughtful enough to send a comment to a complete stranger to help them - that in my eyes has more worth in it than any of the crap society thinks is important. 

I have my moments, I can feel a fair amount of worth (I think its because I try be kind and know I make a difference to friends lives by listening to their problems) then other times I feel so horribly worthless (I think that's when I realise how selfish my friends can be,always talking about themselves, never asking about me because obviously they dont care)... I swing between the two.

The situation can be positive but you say you still find a way to feel sad and i think that's maybe because you feel you dont deserve to be happy, you do, everyone does, even me. Sometimes i just wonder if its worth the effort. 

Thank-you. It's only 10.35am here so I'm hoping it gets better, hasnt been good for a few days now. I flip between everything, a few weeks ago I was so optimistic about everything and now I just dont care. I hope your day gets better too and you see that girl on the bus and find the strength to make eye contact and smile."
depression,ew0ma92,t1_ew0llaa,1564996004.0,"Yeah groceries sometimes helps me too, it's the small interactions with the check out person or the little old lady in the queue that perk me up a little. Unfortunately though the lights really disorientate me and I think it's to do with dissociation I only recently realised I have! I spend a lot of the time feeling I'm in a bubble wearing the wrong glasses, looking into life through a frosty glass if that makes sense? 

Tell me more about the girl!... if you want to, you dont have to as I'm already grateful you replied at all... have you ever spoke to her? 

I get that too, the negative thoughts, I can talk myself out of something I've been really looking forward to easily. One thing I do try when I'm feeling a bit better is challenge ""it would be better without me"" and try turn it into ""yes it would be better without me but I'm gona try turn it round and make it better because of me!"" That wouldn't work today though, just too low."
depression,ew0m1gu,t1_ew0la54,1564995648.0,"I'm interested! So dont worry about saying a lot. 

I love art but dont make enough time to go see it or create it. I dont have Instagram, I used to but dont like putting myself out there, showing people I went to school with my holiday pics etc, this is why I like things like this! I think you have the right idea, a private journal like Instagram page sounds like the way to go, who wants to see Jenny whoever's picture of her dinner/drink/holiday sunset anyway?!"
depression,ew0l5an,t1_ew0kq5i,1564994345.0,"I dont know of a real way to climb out for longer either but settling for a short climb so I can get my act together to buy groceries, job search and walk my dog. 

The sun is shining where I am now but its due to rain this afternoon, typical! Lol I feel like its pathetic fallacy for how I'm feeling.  I agree, the sun has an affect on my mood too. The very worst days are when it doesn't help though, its horrible being depressed on a nice day, I feel like I'm in a little rain cloud bubble and everyone else is so darn happy.

The cinema is a good idea but I've a feeling seeing Mufasa die wont help me at the minute, small things are setting me off lately!!"
depression,ew0kwxy,t1_ew0kmvj,1564994007.0,"Hi Collibet, what do you take pictures of? I like this idea a lot."
depression,ew0kw0p,t1_ew0kkfu,1564993971.0,"I might do this, thankyou for your reply. Although, I think two weeks ago I could write lots of reasons, today I'm not sure what to write. 

My parents only have 1 child so that would be a reason. My dog, I love him so much but that little shit would go to anyone with a treat in their hand! I suppose the uncertainty of what would happen to him if I wasnt here."
depression,ew0kr98,t3_cm6my3,1564993776.0,"Yes I completely get your post! On the worst days I torture myself replaying the bad things I've seen and heard. Sometimes it's a sad animal story ive seen in the news or sometimes it's the people ive seen about hospitals/nursing homes or family members illnesses etc. 

So many people seem concerned with holidays, what to wear to weddings, where to go for after work drinks and I just want to scream none of it matters! So much bad is going on in the world and not many care.

I am training in mental health because I want to help people and make a small difference but sometimes I dont like the people I'm helping because they can also by cruel and I'm just done. Whats the point when I'll never scratch the surface of this sometimes awful world?"
depression,ew0kitj,t3_clzejo,1564993441.0,"Hi lonewolf, not sure if writing to you correctly, I'm new here. 

I have a kind of different problem in that I push what little people are there away. Because what's the point? They'll probably let me down eventually. Why are they interested in some doing time with me? I think of an ulterior motive for them

I dont like that you are starved of attention but I do think it's nice that you embrace the connection/conversation, I hope you get a lot more."
