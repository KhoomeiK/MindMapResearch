So the formula for growth factor is f(x) = a( 1 + r) to the x (I’m not sure how to do exponents on mobile, but it’s to the x power, the exponent being at the very end)
R is the growth rate
So for d for example, it’s 75% it’s under 100, so you divide 75 by 100, giving you 0.75.

If it’s over 100, like problem f for example, it would be 1.5 
Since it’s over 100, the +1 in the equation is already included 

Hope this makes sense!"

Then theres the Goatman in Texas. Theres also a version in Maryland, each with their own unique tales with local history. 
The Texas version, i dont remember the names of the people, but it happened a bit after slavery had ended. A black man was a goat farmer, and the KKK was very active in the area. One night the members went out and slaughters all of the black guys goats then hung the guy off of the bridge. After that, his spirit sort of merged with the goats and he haunts the surrounding woods. 

The Maryland version, there was an animal testing lab, and one of the theories is that Goatman is an escaped experiment from trying to crossbreed animals and people. There is an actual lab near where Goatman is supposedly common to be seen."

It’s mostly about depression ~~to me atleast~~

“I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but
Holding to the thought of another time”
The first few lines is suicide, not expecting to make it to the next month
The last line (of the quote) is holding on to the past of when they were once happy, but now their depressed and their trying to hold onto their last happiness

“Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out”
