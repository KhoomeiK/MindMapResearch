It's so hard a? Interesting that you get bruises! Are those caused by tensing or something do you think?

Yeah I look at what other people can cope with and I just don't get it. I hope the work I'm doing in therapy will help but geez, I just caught up with family and I'm wiped out. I think it was particularly striking as I've had like 8 weeks with just my SO and LO. 

Aw thanks, it definitely is hard with a toddler! Mainly just the relentlessness and inability to really get some decent alone time. I don't think I could work as well 😬"

Yeah I wouldn't have either. I was kinda resistant to the idea of shame for ages. There's a few videos on YouTube about healthy shame vs toxic shame too. John Bradshaw is another key writer, but I actually found his book a bit depressing (though it was helpful to read his definition), whereas Brene's is more hopeful."
