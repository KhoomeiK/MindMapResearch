I can see where you are coming from, but you're a whole idiot. Her confidence is so low, because she has one breasts. People idolize breasts. Put yourself in her shoes. She should've said something, yes. But something like that is hard to talk about esp someone who is embarrassed by it. If he TRULY LOVES her, ALL OF HER, then this WOULD NOT be a problem. 

I'm in a LDR and I got into a car accident and have a terrible scar and a rod you can see if my shirt is a little low. People stare at me SO SO MUCH. I get asked all kinds of questions when I'm out. I don't like the scar, IM THANKFUL TO BE ALIVE BUT I FEEL LIKE IM JUDGED AND PEOPLE WHISPER. 

But you know what, the guy that I'm with is so sweet and he loves me. He doesnt care about the way I look. 

To OP: Baby, you will find someone who is just that. I wish you luck. But don't be with ANYONE who is going to focus on your looks rather than you."

SuicideWatch,fljdbnn,t3_fp17ug,1585207717.0,"Hello, love. I really, really hope you read this. 

This will be a lot, but I will give you two stories from two different people. If you don't have the energy to read it all, it's okay. At least read the last bit.

My best and only friend(23F) has struggled socially. When we were younger, even up until she was around 21), I used to have to order her food when we went somewhere. She could never talk to anyone. She'd be consumed with so much anxiety, she'd  have a meltdown. Last year she started a new job, she made a few friends and she was coming out of her shell a little. Her job had her on the phone the entire shift, so that really helped her. She started to date a coworker and go out with coworkers. She's so talkative now, she's like a new person. We don't really talk as much anymore because she's always thinking, and being with them. But I've watched her blossom and I'm proud of her. She still struggles with talking to people, she feels so bad sometimes and thinks that she lets people down (which she doesn't), but anxiety plays a deep roll into this. She also has this friend who treats her like garbage, but still seems them; and I hope one day she lets them go because they really take a toll on her mental health.  


I was very lonely as a child. I had friends when I lived in a neighborhood, but when we moved I was 11 years old and I never speak to them. We've moved on and grown apart. I struggled making friends in school, I was talk to people but never had a friendship. I met my best friend when I was 12 at a summer camp. But she was younger than me and we weren't in the same grade. We didn't really talk as much for a while due to going to separate schools and we didn't have a phone. Even throughout highschool we barely spoke. Not up until a year or so ago we started to see each other a lot more. Life happens, you know? I don't speak to anyone I've spoken with or friends with in school except her.  


I'm now going on 25, and I've learned that we meet people for reasons. I've worked different jobs, have met new people, and have made friends. As of now, those friends are no longer my friends. I do miss them from time to time, but some relationships can be too toxic or just fade. It's something I've accepted. But you know what? Once one door closes, another one opens and I wholeheartedly believe that. 

I almost gave up last year, I sought help at a community outreach center because I don't have health insurance and thanks to them I am still here. I still struggle but I am still here. Please, see it out.

depression,ffw2n7m,t3_evjd3e,1580281686.0,"The same thing happened to me last year. I couldn't stop thinking, my wouldnt shut up. I cant stress that enough. It literally would not shut up. No matter what I did, work, driving, watching tv, i could not stop thinking. I was suicidal but my son kept me here, I didnt want him to hate me or think I didnt love enough to stay. I didnt want him to view me the same way you dont want your family to. I dropped friends too, but I know they werent really friends because they saw what I was going through but stopped communicating. I started to take antidepressants and go to therapy. 

But what has helped quiet my mind, is that I changed everything that was negatively influencing me. 

If you are taking hard drugs, I cant tell you what to do, but please do not do that.. you have a purpose here just as I do, it's hard to see that but it's true. If it gets bad, I knew someone who went to rehab for a few weeks for depression and drug use, hes doing very well now. 

But of course, depression is just a lingering POS. Try to be more honest with your therapist and if you dont feel like you're getting through then find another. I'm here to always listen if you're feeling off, it really sucks but it's also nice I'm not the only one experiencing a shit time. Very many do not understand and it's nice to talk to someone who does. Makes you feel less lonely"

I talked about it with my boyfriend and I cried a lot and i felt better. I've started online classes on Tuesday, so my mind has been focused on that but I just woke up and I didnt wake up with a emptiness or today is going to be dreadful feeling.

Honestly my dad left when I was a baby and he gave my ma a lot of headache. He did come back but at one point I didnt see him for a very long time. He ended up remarrying a complete shit show and he hasn't tried to contact me. Many years later, I now have a child that he knows about but doesnt see. I dont communicate with him at all, haven't spoken to the man in over a decade. When the day comes when he passes I will not go. Because I shouldn't go somewhere to mourn over someone who left me.

depression,f1lqqxl,t3_d9w4lq,1569564297.0,"I am very sorry to hear this :( I also have a bad relationship with my mother. If there is someone in your life that causing great stress and/or making you feel guilt (even though you've done nothing) etc etc; do you keep them in your life? No, right? Right, because they cause you pain. You have the right to do what YOU think is best for YOU. And now that you have a beautiful baby, you do for YOU and the baby. The baby needs you, so please take care of yourself. You even recognizing how you dont want to turn out like your mom shows how strong of a person you are. 

I understand not having a relationship with your mother sucks.. I wish I could resolve it. But please dont go down on a sick path to please her. I know it hurts, I know how bad it feels to not go to your own mother for advice on parenting, makes you feel lonely and you start thinking you're the one in the wrong. Please, do not think it, because you are a great person. For even caring for someone who abused you. You. Are. Strong. As. Hell. 

I am slowly starting to accept that things will not change with my mother. But if not associating with her makes me and my child feel better and less stressed, then I will do it 100000%. 

Look up Stockholm syndrome, I feel like you might be interested in that topic. Because it kind of feels like you have that with your relationship with your mother. 

I wish luck to you fellow mommy, keep your head up. The dark times will pass. Congrats on the baby!"
