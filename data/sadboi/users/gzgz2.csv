SuicideWatch,fm1ovuf,t3_fs5gg5,1585682351.0,"Yeah you sound like a trauma victim. You lose friends precisely because you care way too much. If someone appears desperate or clings to me scared that they‚Äôll lose me, alarm bells ring in my brain, speaking as a normal person. If I am exploitative and immoral, I would even try to take advantage of your attachment - in which case you end up attracting very manipulative and harmful people, which is even worse. In terms of dating, women get very turned off by desperation and can sense it from a mile away. This isn‚Äôt what you want to hear but most people, if they sense some desperate kid wanting to be their friend ‚Äúforever‚Äù and can‚Äôt stop worrying over it, we get the **** out of that situation quickly. Also it‚Äôs quite SELFISH if you think about it, because how can someone who BARELY knows me want to be friends with me unless they have a hidden agenda? I am not some vehicle for you to not be alone. You should have a choice of company too. Precisely because you have no friends, you don‚Äôt become selective about friends. For me, I genuinely do not just want to have anyone as my friend. I won‚Äôt even bother with most people because I am selective as YOU should be too. But you won‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt have self respect. People don‚Äôt exist for you to use for your loneliness. You have to be a good friend to have friends. 

You basically need to take things one step at a time. Sit down and TEMPORARILY ACCEPT the discomfort of having no friends.  Then work on yourself and learn that you deserve respect. Anyone who suffered trauma may or may not have the best relationship with himself considering others blatantly disrespected them whether through physical or verbal abuse. That is one. 

From there, you can then work on social skills. Learning how to date (yes it requires effort). At least you know now rather than later."

A rumor that you have Aspergers is not enough to cause people to not be friends with you. 


School isn‚Äôt everything, sure, but you went to college to learn. This is the purpose of college. Right now you need to have priorities. If you have decent grades, that‚Äôs great. 

Also this is where you‚Äôre wrong: plainly, you don‚Äôt need to have friends to find a decent job. If you have valuable skills and a good GPA, you can get a job, move to a different city or even country and then make friends. But most importantly, you need to graduate and get a job. 

You care way too much about friends. Plenty of people in third world countries have zero friends and have to go around carrying buckets of water on their heads or have to go into mines to support themselves and their families. They can still survive so friends are not a necessity. You can of course still have them but learn to take care of yourself first. Also in life, oftentimes the less you care, paradoxically the more likely you‚Äôll get those things including friends."
SuicideWatch,fm1b6ma,t3_fs5gg5,1585675268.0,"Okay that‚Äôs fine. Looks like you need to make some changes in communication. I know people like you who are kind and good people deep down but because of the way you‚Äôre raised, you don‚Äôt know how to communicate properly. At least in your reply, you sound pretty normal so your case isn‚Äôt severe. I would watch movies preferably with respectable characters (not some gangster movie) and listen to how they interact with one another. Or if you find a character irritating, know why he or she is irritating and don‚Äôt act like that. Pay attention to body language as well. Avoid bad posture. 

Regarding what you‚Äôre going to do once you‚Äôre back in college, you‚Äôre going to graduate and learn. THAT IS THE POINT OF COLLEGE. It‚Äôs really simple. It would‚Äôve have been nice to make friends, join a fraternity or club (which you still can hypothetically), etc but the point of college is EDUCATION. Graduate and then you can get a job. That is all. Being educated will also help with social skills so you actually have valuable things to add to a conversation instead of making dumb comments or having no substance.

SuicideWatch,fm0iv0a,t3_fsbdse,1585658970.0,"It‚Äôs hard to know if you‚Äôre actually ugly just because that‚Äôs your view of yourself (not that I am encouraging you to post your picture) because I dated a guy who literally looks in the mirror and can‚Äôt stand looking at himself when he‚Äôs actually not ugly whatsoever. He just is disgusted at himself because of his poor social skills which lead girls to reject him. Playing devil‚Äôs advocate here, a lot of women especially if they‚Äôre attractive simply don‚Äôt have time to deal with men who constantly harass them or are only nice to them because of their looks (trust me, they know from a mile away), so they might be harsh simply because they have to battle this everyday. They don‚Äôt necessarily mean it or have bad intentions so I wouldn‚Äôt take it personally. If a guy is mean to you because of your looks, that‚Äôs kind of odd because men don‚Äôt operate like that and judge other men largely on status instead of physical appearances alone. Regardless, you just have to work with what you‚Äôve got. You can improve your hygiene (which most men can really look 10x better if they just do this), dress better or get plastic surgery if it really bothers you but there are many other problems that can afflict any one person so you can invest in other parts of yourself whether it‚Äôs education, social skills, career, technical skills, etc. There is no need to feel like a broken or damaged person just because you feel like you‚Äôre ugly (which again, might not even be the case)."

It‚Äôs much easier (you may think) to just commit suicide so you can escape but that‚Äôs not how life works. Setbacks and failures are a natural part of life and contrary to what social media portrays you can‚Äôt be elated 100% of the time. One thing that works for me is to not take life or yourself too seriously which in itself is a process.

HOWEVER: i have no idea how your wife is really like so it‚Äôs hard to say conclusively it‚Äôs your fault although usually it‚Äôs both hers and yours. Maybe try temporarily separating from her without outright divorcing her for a while.

I have had lots of yes men around me and can honestly say not all company is good.

SuicideWatch,fm04718,t3_fs5gg5,1585644023.0,"You‚Äôre definitely not the only one - in fact as HUMANS (Aspergers or not), we seek connection and to want to be loved is only natural. I am actually loved by my family and ex boyfriend but I still don‚Äôt care about living - maybe I‚Äôm just selfish so it‚Äôs not like being loved would mean you would automatically love life because I am loved and I still don‚Äôt want to live. 
However, speaking as someone who has been on both sides of being bullied and bullying others, I think if that‚Äôs a recurring theme in your life -then I would question 
1) do I personally see myself as someone who should get bullied all the time? People normally attract treatment from others based on how they see themselves. As a former bully/ remotely socially intelligent person, I preyed on the weak (often casually, just because of convenience. Not that I am like getting out of my way to harm another human but simply because if someone doesn‚Äôt fight back, people won‚Äôt be disincentivized from not exploiting them). If you do see yourself as deserving of bullying, then you need to do some self reflection and inner work and heal that relationship with yourself. 
2) if not, you need to invest in developing social skills. I used to have social anxiety that I completely overcame after traveling in Europe, Asia and Africa. If I can do it, you can do. Once you develop a healthy sense of self and social skills, you wouldn‚Äôt just accept the bullying and people will therefore stop bullying you."

Essentially he was like a trauma victim because of the poor experience with his ex. I really hope you give your new girlfriend a chance and try to not see her with those lens.

In America if you‚Äôre a working class man with no degree you‚Äôre essentially worthless to society. People treat you like crap. You have expensive health care that lands you in bankruptcy. Yet because of the American Dream, society blames you as if it was your own fault. If I‚Äôm not wrong, 1/4 men don‚Äôt have a single friend. 

In third world countries, people don‚Äôt blame you for your poverty and judge you morally for that. Also you‚Äôre not constantly buying the latest iPhone or car or acquiring status symbols because otherwise no woman would come near you. There is a sense of community especially among the poor where even if the (corrupt) government cannot step in, people pool resources together. If you have religion, you also avoid some pitfalls like alcohol and gambling that cause a lot of misery in people. 

Now, if you‚Äôre in a war torn country where people are starving, then your instinct will not be to lie around in bed being sad but to actually fight to survive but not every so called third world country is necessarily at that level of disaster."

By then, I was convinced this was so ridiculous that if I was truly truly truly suicidal, I would have died already given the long hold and would never put my precious life in this random person‚Äôs hands.

Has it occurred to you that humans NATURALLY have a survival instinct? I must give credit for this story to Douglas Bloch on YouTube (check out his >100 videos about how he survived 4 periods of depression and attempted suicides). He and his friend (aware that he was suicidal) were walking on a road when all of a sudden his friend pushed him onto the direction of incoming traffic. He was livid and shouted ‚ÄúWhy did you do that for?!‚Äù and that would have been my response as well.

I made memories of a lifetime so that even if I do kill myself, I can die happy. eventually a solution to my problems actually surfaced organically - one that I could never have planned. You really don‚Äôt know where life will take you so so long as you‚Äôre doing SOMETHING (preferably learning skills or a language rather than watching porn, etc), you‚Äôre moving forward."
SuicideWatch,f8o4krl,t3_e1696n,1574662590.0,"If your so called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù only use you then find better quality, new friends who like you for who you are. If you can‚Äôt find anyone like that then maybe do some self reflection. No one is inherently unloveable but maybe work on communication skills or experiment with different social groups. 

Notice how everything above is actionable. I laid it out for you so if you still resort to suicide that‚Äôs emotional and mental laziness. Look, I know it‚Äôs hard but perhaps stop searching for external validation or even a support system. Support yourself (try meditation, read some Buddhist texts, millions if not hundreds of millions of people before you have managed just fine without a support system) and seek meaning and purpose rather than material or external things. Self pity gets your nowhere even though it‚Äôs easy. 

I have faith in you and life has consistently proven to give me nice surprises in my experience, many of which my brain couldn‚Äôt even fathom and at times when I least expected them so stay open-minded."
SuicideWatch,f8o421v,t3_e10kn7,1574661989.0,"Hey this might hurt but you need to hear it. If your mom and fianc√© won‚Äôt even be there for you or are too exhausted to care, then they don‚Äôt deserve you. I know for a fact even if I am a vegetable or brain dead my parents would never give up on me.
If anything, that anger would make me want to live for myself, on my own terms. They don‚Äôt deserve your unhappiness so start living for yourself."
SuicideWatch,f8o3iiy,t3_e145sk,1574661389.0,"Hey there. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre still in college in your early 20s or late teens. Hate to break it to you but people come and go but the bright side is IT IS OKAY :) Don‚Äôt try to cling too tightly to anyone. If you‚Äôre lucky, your parents will always be there for you but you can‚Äôt expect that from anyone else. 
Over the years a lot of my BEST friends have drifted apart. Sometimes it‚Äôs because of misunderstandings, drama, or simply they‚Äôre going through things that have NOTHING to do with you and just need a break from it all. I know because I willingly disconnected from some ex-best friends because i changed (my worldview, beliefs, values, personality, life style, etc) not them... but you know what, when the time comes, they might come back into your life or you might go back into theirs because life just happens. You can‚Äôt force it. No need to consider suicide over friendships even if it‚Äôs your ‚Äúbest‚Äù friend. Think of it as a pause rather than an end. I know it‚Äôs hard but keep in mind you have choice in who you keep in your life too. I had a best friend who was repeatedly going back to destructive self hatred and we no longer talk but I don‚Äôt really miss her. I don‚Äôt hate her either but I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself just because of her lolll  

Keep making new friends and forging new friendships. Life goes on :)"

I had a low-life ex who hurt me (Wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call a jerk or narcissistic per se) and even though I have fleeting thoughts about suicide, I REFUSE to end my life because of a pathetic person like him. I don‚Äôt live for him or anyone else but myself. He‚Äôs not worth even a strand of my hair. üòÇ"
SuicideWatch,f8o2b8z,t3_e17tqg,1574660112.0,"Hey I know you won‚Äôt just trust a complete stranger on the internet but I would highly suggest you travel because sometimes you might be pleasantly surprised. Not everyone is an asshole like Americans who judge you on superficial characteristics whether it is looks, class, race, etc. Even if they do, you might be ugly in America but attractive in other countries. Regarding your social anxiety, I am a PERFECT example of someone who for the entire period between junior high school and until I graduated college, I was convinced I had social problems and at some point suffered such severe social anxiety that if I stuttered or spoke in class, I would beat myself up afterwards and play the embarrassing scene a million times in my head weeks after the event. After I studied in a different country and met non-Americans and learnt about DIFFERENT cultural/belief systems, I actually became a people lover and gained incredible faith in humanity (maybe went overboard lol) that I could NEVER imagine. 
You know what the saddest part about all of this was?! I always thought I was an introverted person and for years there was a hole in my soul and I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. After living abroad, I learned that I have ALWAYS been an extroverted person but in the wrong country/environment. Hey, I‚Äôm still grateful for my american upbringing and education and had it better than most in other ways but I finally felt complete and now I know why I had a hole in my being, I no longer have social anxiety. I actually regularly give talks and presentations and I am super social to the point where I still get invited to parties in other countries I don‚Äôt even live in. 
Point is this: sometimes life unfolds in unexpected ways. I am the last person to tell to blindly put all your faith in hope but actually, we all need to question our deeply held beliefs. Keep in mind I NEVER got treatment for my social anxiety. I literally got cured naturally once I gained confidence and discovered my naturally gregarious outgoing extroverted self. 5 years ago no one in the world could convince me I could be cured of my social anxiety or that I was extroverted. 
Stay open-minded. :)"
