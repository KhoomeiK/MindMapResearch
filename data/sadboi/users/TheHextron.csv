I was even suggested a tattoo artist that had done work on several friends and was aware of who I was through mutual friends before I even contacted her.

When the shot lands on the cyclist being visibly upset, the spanish speaking announcer basically says the same that we all have been reading but also adds that he's a young 28 year old athlete and that he couldn't have expected this lack of mechanical support (please correct me if I'm wrong). 

The written statement provided by this station uses sources from the race organizers to explain the delay in assistance. I'm about to heavily paraphrase but the outline is this:  


  
""The amount of service cars for this race was an already stretched resource. Allowing specific team cars to pass competing teams would have presented dangers not only to other vehicles, but to the entire race itself. For this reason, the organizers of the race decided that no vehicle should pass another whether or not the service vehicle is neutral. When conditions improve, we'll allow the cars to pass one by one"".
