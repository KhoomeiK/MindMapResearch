If you have really deep seeded issues (which lets be fucking real, is most of us), then sometimes the basic versions of therapy don't really get at some of the underlying issues. 

I personally had to go through so many iterations, and so many different types of therapy before I found the right one.

I think it definitely is helpful when you do - it's less ""fake it till you make it"", and more ""question your core assumptions because they are likely wrong in some ways"", and explore that until you choose the path of thoughts that is more ""helpful"". 

Helps you re-write your internal narrative in this instance, as well as just unloading about all the shit that happens (which in and of it's own is super helpful)"

Usually for most people this is **AVERSION**. Aversion to getting started, failing, the cringe we feel before doing a task etc. Aversion is what makes it so much easier to plan than do, and to procrastinate also just before getting into something.

Once you begin to become aware of the aversion, you can then explore why you have that aversion, and what the underlying issues are. 

Next step is to then over time learn to accept uncertainty and focus specifically on the first step (aka getting started / taking action), instead of letting the cringe and uncertainty / aversion blockers of steps 2-6 get in the way and block you from starting doing!"

This happens a lot in procrastinating as well - we're so ugh and cringing at the thought of the task ahead, that it's so much easier to check the news / do something distracting / play some games etc.

This is a really hard one to overcome, but can be done. So so so important to just maintain laser focus on step one of the task, and put aside all the rest of it. You want to separate out the aversion from: (A) the first step of the task; versus (B) the end result. There's also a (C) in your case, which is **your perception of a reality in which** people may or may not react in a certain way. 

Best thing is to try to become more and more aware of these feelings. Try to question the shit out of (C) every time, because it's just not productive. Then, try to put aside (B) as much as you can and just tell it to fuck off / do your best not to think about it. Focus everything on (A), and the immediate best next step!"

1. Journal out all your shit before you go to sleep. Don't think or try to structure what you're writing, just get it all out
2. When you then go to try to sleep, don't try to escape those 85737473 thoughts! Whenever you try to resist or get away from thoughts, they just take over the whole fucking world... It's better to dedicate 2-3 minutes to deliberately think about each thought, and then ask your mind 'am I done with this, or do I want to explore the thought even more'. Once you're done, move on to the next one.
3. At the end of this, if you're still awake, then just focus on different parts of your body. It's super important to move the focus from your thoughts to your body.

TLDR - get the shit out of your head onto paper through writing before you sleep, don't avoid the thoughts and instead focus fully on them, and then focus on your body after all that!"

We the team at[ www.ensu.com](https://www.ensu.com/), are building an app related to music listening and emotions.

We're a team of mental health passionate people who want to make it easier for people to understand their inner dialogue, and see how those inner feelings are changing over time (for the better or for the worse, so that you can act on them).

teenagers,fk8prrm,t3_fh430i,1583960574.0,"Hey mate! I'm one of the people behind [Ensu](http://bit.ly/2TH3rP3), and I'm kind of shocked at how while there's an insane amount of info coming out around physical health advice around Corona, there's basically zero advice out there on mental health and staying sane during this time (despite the obvious fact that people are stressed AF and losing their shit....)

We want to help people from the psychological standpoint, and so we've just decided to create a series of daily small tips people can do during coronavirus to keep themselves mentally well and stay sane! Not sure if it would be helpful to you, but you can follow it here: [https://www.instagram.com/p/B9m1WZSJeuv/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9m1WZSJeuv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Hope it's helpful!"

You can use music to alter your moods, and the music we listen to often comes from our mood!

If you're a Spotify listener, you should check out [ensu.com](http://bit.ly/2TH3rP3). It's a project from me and my friends on music and moods. If you're more interested in what we're doing, feel free to join our [Discord beta community](https://discord.gg/ensu) and you can speak to me / our engineers / machine learning people directly there too!"

If you just listen to whatever you like when you're feeling happy, and label a beat / emotion whenever you're feeling that way, we can automatically generate mood playlists for you that are specific to the music you enjoy listening to the most when you're happy / upbeat!

Would love your feedback if you can be bothered enough to try it out!"

I'm one of the devs behind Ensu ([ensu.com](http://bit.ly/2TH3rP3)), where we're trying to help Spotify listeners with their moods based on the music they listen to. If you check in how you feel 7-10 times when you listen to music, we can automatically generate mood playlists for you that are specific to the music you listen to the most!

I'd love it if you could check us out and tell me your honest feedback! If you're more interested in what we're doing, feel free to join our [Discord beta community](https://discord.gg/ensu) and you can speak to me / our engineers / machine learning people directly there too! 

On our Discord server, we have a tonne of playlists / songs that people share too :)"
