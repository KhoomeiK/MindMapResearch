My partner occasionally does a similar thing.
She's occasionally convinced that she won't/can't orgasm so ""dont bother trying"". At that point I gotta say, who cares, shutup, we'll have fun anyway. And most times she will eventually get there.

When your mind is so focused on can't or won't it's almost impossible to do. This happens a lot with blokes and erection issues. We can be so focused on staying hard that we lose focus on the fun and mentally sabotage ourselves into losing it. 
Then, that one off creeps into your thoughts next time, and the time after to the point where we're convinced that we just can't stay hard.

Try to forget the goal of an orgasm and just have fun. 
If you get there, cool.
If not, at least you had a fuckin good time."

If taken at face value, it's clear that the school isn't effectively protecting this little bloke and that the parents of the bullies aren't ensuring their kids behave.

This seems more like a last ditch effort for this kids pain to be heard by those who should be protecting him from this damage.

Unfortunately exposing this display of raw emotion and the publicity that follows might be an effective way of getting him the focus he needs.
Putting the school and the parents of kids bullying hum in a position to step up or risk being outed publicly.
