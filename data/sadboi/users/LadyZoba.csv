Anxiety,f1gowtc,t1_f1em0do,1569472829.0,"Me drinking alcohol wasn't my first time,but it was my first time getting tipsy. :)"
Anxiety,f1elhef,t3_d91jl7,1569424926.0,"I never got drunk before,when I went to my friend's birthday I drank  some alcohol and I got tipsy.I couldn't stop laughing for 5 minutes straight and I got to a point when I was on the verge of crying because I didn't cried in a long time and I started panicking because I couldn't control my emotions.It was horrible.When my friend took me home with her car I had to focus so hard to not cry  ,my heart was beating so fast and I felt so miserable.When I got home I cried myself to sleep.So yeah,never gonna drink more than one glass ever again."
Anxiety,f1ekssh,t3_d93kcm,1569424487.0,"Believe me I know how hard it is,when I was at school all I did in breaks is listening to music and eating my lunch in my seat,I rarely went out to the yard cause there were a lot of people outside.I'm not sure what kind of advice should I give you because I know how hard it is to go against anxiety,but as far as I experienced being outside reduces anxiety and you don't necessarily need to socialize while doing it if you are still too anxious,just take everything slowly,go out to the school yard(if you can,I don't know how it is with your school) and read a book or listen to music.I wish I would be there to give you a hug and be your friend because I know this was something I always needed,a good hug and somebody to tell me that everything will be alright and there's nothing to worry about.I hope you have a great day. :) (20/F,so I'm not that old and struggling with uni now)"

MobileLegendsGame,f1djl0p,t1_f1dagds,1569386437.0,Moonton not gonna give you an epic skin like that for free.That skin looks like good quality and they took time making it.
Anxiety,f1cadxu,t3_d8row5,1569353428.0,Awkwardly.I try to ask some general questions but since I'm not really interested and I don't know what to say so I try to make it quick.I hate working in groups.
Anxiety,f1c9qdl,t3_d8qt56,1569353030.0,I don't like the sound of my voice in general.When I'm anxious my throat becomes dry and my voice cracks while speaking because I have to swallow involuntarily.Or when I speak to fast and a stumble upon my words so it comes out gibberish.It's so frustrating.People tend to not take you as seriously as before.

MobileLegendsGame,f1apz3z,t1_f1abi3t,1569302114.0,"Yeah,they should bring new special skins to the lucky shop.Like how much would it hurt for Moonton to put 3 different skins for 100 days each in to the shop?I doubt that they would go bankrupt."
mobilelegends,f17q4k1,t1_f16y39c,1569246716.0,I know it's so cute <3

socialanxietydefeated,f11td44,t1_f0yz25l,1569130283.0,"A panic attack is a lot more intense and comes out of nowhere,you don't have control and you feel like you are dying(based on how people in this subreddit described it).An anxiety attack is a bit weaker,you have control and you are aware to your environment,I can even talk with someone without them noticing it.It builds up gradually from something that you get anxious from(in my case public speaking,social situations and if my stomach is upset,I have emetophobia,fear of vomitting).You get pale,you feel lightheaded,your heart rate increases,you start shaking and you have a feeling of fear in your chest,but not as intensely as in the case of a panic attack."

Anxiety,f0xqwbz,t3_d72kdu,1569042618.0,"I'm goint back to uni and I am an emotional wreck already.It also affects my physical health gravely.My stomach is in a bad condition,if some food doesn't taste the best or my stomach had some other problem with it I have to throw up and I didn't mentioned that my stomach acid production is overactive.My mom told me,since I was examined by a doctor and there is nothing physically wrong with me,that I need to stop beong nervous and there's nothing to be nervous about...Like...you say that as if I could and I wouldn't do it."
mobilelegends,f0xq1ct,t1_f0xi63f,1569041552.0,Angela main here and I wouldn't say she is a no skill hero.You have to have map awareness and time your ult otherwise you are pretty much useless.
MobileLegendsGame,f0lour5,t3_d5diu3,1568725544.0,"From what I've seen about Masha when she was in our team and in the enemy,I agree she is a bit squishy with her 3 hp bars and can't do well against marksmans and mages.Though I have to say she is really good at pushing turrets and getting the turtle.She can take the turtle in a few seconds so the other team doesn't even have time to react."
