In high school, I was eating 1200 calories a day, aiming to be 120. I never reached my goal weight, but I was in the 120s and was always complimented for how tiny and fit I looked. 

The truth is, most of us will never comfortably be at such a low weight (I think 115 is the lowest possible healthy weight for 5’6). It sounds like your body doesn’t want to be that thin. Also keep in mind that eating 600 calories has slowed your metabolism. 

I know it’s not the answer you want to hear, but I’d try to be happy with your current weight. It’s been a long journey, but I’m much happier at 130 now than I was when I was obsessing about losing weight when I was 125."
loseit,fl7cy46,t3_fmsigl,1584899178.0,"First of all, congratulations on losing 70 pounds!! If you’ve lost the weight before, that means you can lose it again if you need to. 

As another university student, I’m in the same boat, and I’ve found myself mindlessly eating a lot. One thing I’ve found is that eating carby snacks just makes me hungrier and more likely to eat more calories than I need. I love foods like chips and crackers, and my family keeps a lot of them around, but I feel much better and more satisfied when I focus on foods like fruits, veggies, Greek yogurt, cheese, and nuts. Also, knowing that I like to eat throughout the day, I’ve moved my eating schedule from 3 meals a day to 5-6 small meals.

At the same time, give yourself some grace. There is a lot of uncertainty and anxiety right now, and there is a lot more time to sit around and eat. I ate a few too many brownies last night, and I’m trying not to beat myself up about it. I’d aim for maintenance more than losing during this time, but at the same time, gaining a few pounds isn’t the end of the world. I figure we can lose weight once we’re busier and can actually go to the gym.

What’s helped me the most is finding creative hobbies that I don’t usually have time for. I’ve been painting, coloring, and playing guitar. Another helpful strategy is staying away from the kitchen as much as possible. Whenever I feel like binging, I move my Netflix session upstairs to my room.

Wishing you the best of luck, and remember this is only temporary!"

I believe differences are good sometimes, though, because they help us learn and grow. The best solution I’ve found for the kind of loneliness you’re describing is to give to other people first, even if it is not always reciprocated. Make an effort to understand someone else before you hope for them to understand you. Giving your time, help, and a listening ear to others first makes it far more likely for you to get it in return. Obviously this isn’t always the case, but then you can see who does and doesn’t deserve a place in your life.

My twin flame has also distanced himself from me recently. I asked to be his girlfriend around Christmas time, but he said he just wanted to be friends. He said he wasn’t in a good place for a relationship, as he doesn’t have a good job or his own place now. He still texts me fairly regularly and we’ve continued to hang out. It’s clear he doesn’t want me out of his life. It sounds like you’re in a similar situation. 

I think he has deep feelings for you, but he might be too immature or scared right now to know how to deal with those feelings. He still has room to grow and mature. My advice for you is to use this time to focus on yourself. Twin flame separation can be the perfect time for both partners to grow and do the inner work necessary to heal and progress in life.

We’re both on the spiritual path, but we haven’t become our fully ideal selves yet. I have a lot of healing still left to do, and I think he does too.
