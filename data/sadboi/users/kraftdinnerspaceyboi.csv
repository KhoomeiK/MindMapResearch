lexapro,fpay4c3,t3_gce1wp,1588458133.0,"Iâ€™ve experienced something like that but with depression. When I first started my depression got much worse before it just almost entirely disappeared. 3 weeks later I didnâ€™t get out of bed at my usual time and just laid in my bed for two hours and ever since that morning my depression has been back but my anxiety is like I never had it to begin with which is nice. My psychiatrist ended up sending a new medication suggestion to my doctor for if my depression is still effecting me come June. Maybe you should try talking to your doctor if the anxiety persists, you could need a dosage change or something."

I also had to stay on 5mg for a month before increasing instead of two weeks because my body takes a while to adjust and I also found that really helped."

Like Iâ€™ll eat an apple thatâ€™s perfect in every way but yet it tastes like itâ€™s bruised all over, and just to prove to myself Iâ€™m tasting what Iâ€™m tasting I have someone else try that same apple and they will always say how itâ€™s a good apple and tastes fine. I can relate to the milk tasting sour when itâ€™s not, itâ€™s why I stopped drinking milk. Food tasting off was actually one of the first symptoms I experienced of psychosis"

I cannot say I have ever dissociated to that extent before, however Iâ€™ve had something similar where I was prepping food for my lunch just like any other person would, I wasnâ€™t talking to anyone cause I was home alone, but my mind had me set at my grandmothers house and I was watering her plants and when I snapped out of it I had an entire sandwich made in front of me and I had no clue as to how or when I made that sandwich because I was sure I was at my grandmas house...
