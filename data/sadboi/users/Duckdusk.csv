Last week I pulled myself out of a very bad depressive period and went straight into hypomania. Meanwhile I still have *lesser* and brief mood swings from my BPD. I wouldn't say it's a mixed episode tho, it's just my BPD showing up from time to time. 

Yet it feels so invalidating cause as soon as I get overwhelmed by something and start crying while I'm hypomanic I start thinking that I must've been faking it the whole time!

It really is exhausting."

bipolar,fk7ektb,t3_fgqkvy,1583934780.0,"I needed to read this so much, thank you!

I've been diagnosed just recently by a therapist I've been seeing for more than a year now (because of my BPD), so he *knows* me and he has already told me many times that me feeling like I'm faking it's just me invalidating myself! 

And it hurts so much when I do it because deep down I know who I am and what I have to deal with every single day. But then I start reading on *how* mania/hypomania is supposed to be, how others experience it and I feel like I don't have it that bad, that I'm faking it for attention and it hurts so much cause I even stop seeking help as if I don't deserve it as much as others.

So again, thank you."
