He grew up slaughtering anyone from any other clan, which would certainly scar a child. His brother was killed by their rival clan, and even then he came past that to achieve peace with that very clan. On top of that, the rival clan becomes racist towards his clan, discriminating against them as evil. When that’s the world you’re born into, you’ll try to change it too, and having been given a solution via the Uchiha tablet, of course you’ll attempt to save the world via that solution."
