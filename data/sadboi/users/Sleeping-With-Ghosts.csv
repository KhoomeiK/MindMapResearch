After that my mom said she wanted me on birth control so took me to a female pediatric gyn who made her stay out of the room and then gave me a brief sex-ed talk.

The people in front of us had seen the guy first and sped up, causing a three car back ending accident in front.  The people in back hit us in such a way that probably saved us from falling off the cliff.  All in all it was a seven car accident because some asshole decided to drive drunk.
