I moved middle schools, then I moved high schools, then mid way through college I moved. I am an adult now,24, and I've been on the same team at work for nearly 1-1\2  but that's no place for real friends ships bc they leave or I am leaving to an adjacent role.

I feel you, really I do."

Have your own opinion, share it if you please, but don't degrade others for theirs. What about all the ""Democrats ""who open support killing a living child with a heart beat?........ oh wait it isnt just Democrats it's just PEOPLE. What happend to all the bullshit about not placing labels on others. 

We live in the land of idiocracy."
