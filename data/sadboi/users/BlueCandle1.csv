My gf is in grad school in another field, but she has close friends who are M3s at other schools, and I think that helped her set reasonable expectations about my availability and the amount of work I would need to do. 

I love my girlfriend, and I’m glad I’m with her. But if I’m being honest, I don’t know if I would recommend trying to make an LDR work in medical school. It’s an emotionally trying thing during what will likely be the most stressful period of your life so far."
