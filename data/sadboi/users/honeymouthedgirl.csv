On the surface, I have it together. I‚Äôm a graduate of two universities and now have an office job at a third, but most mornings I struggle to get out of bed. 

I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and had to call my mom sobbing last week during a panic attack. It‚Äôs exhausting to just maintain my sanity, to go to work and go to the grocery store, to keep cool. I worry any second I could slip down the rabbit hole. I took a year off on medical leave & finished school with a reduced course load and accommodations.
