Like PTSD level. The bathroom I hid in to bawl. His loving eyes looking at me and him saying he needs me. Eventually me telling him I read the texts. And then his protests. And having to compartmentalize it all. Anyway. That scene is a SHOCK to the system. Shock shock shock. Ok that‚Äôs all just wanted to help you feel less alone :)"

I‚Äôve never actually talked to someone who‚Äôs been through something similar. Whenever I try to explain it people are in disbelief, and like ‚Äúwow I don‚Äôt know how you made it through that‚Äù. All I wanna say is ‚Äúerrrr I don‚Äôt think I did make it through‚Äù. It‚Äôs weird because it challenges everything we‚Äôve learned. Betrayal by someone in need. It‚Äôs a total colliding of circumstances: the part of you that cares and wants to be there for the one you love (or wtv) and the other reaction which is to recoil and protect yourself from the betrayal. Betrayer and sick person don‚Äôt go together usually, in what we‚Äôre taught anyway. 

My long term reaction was oddly one of guilt. But I think that was in big part bc of his manipulation. It was just so hard for me to accept that I‚Äôd pushed him away when he ‚Äúneeded me most‚Äù‚Äî my dad died of cancer and I‚Äôm a total caretaker type. It really challenged my values and how I think about things. Aka black and white vs nuanced etc. 

Anyway. Again, I‚Äôm so sorry. You‚Äôre def in trauma response right now and all you can do is take care of YOU, your basic needs and the healing that is needed. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
survivinginfidelity,fon03rc,t3_g73214,1587908918.0,"I went through something similar. My emotionally abusive ex was diagnosed w cancer on the day I was finally ready to leave him. I stuck it out as a result. Total hell. 

He went in for his operation to remove the tumour. I had his things. Including phone. A text comes in from his female worker that ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt worry about‚Äù. It says ‚ÄúI wish I could be there when you wake up‚Äù. 

Like you, I scrolled. Honestly I think I just wanted to be proved wrong. Like show me something that proves me wrong here. All I saw was two people flirting and falling in love. Pet names and all. 

The hardest part for me was when he woke up. I was hysterical but he‚Äôd just had major surgery and was drugged up. I cried for hours and he thought it was bc of the cancer lol. 

Anyway. Definitely in the top 2 most traumatic events in my life. 4 years later I still feel changed by it."

I'm a huge consumer of audio books, which was a natural evolution from podcasts. I got frustrated by the surface-level end results and fragmented information feeling I got. 

Often, when I am listening, I daydream of writing bits on my walls, drawing up diagrams or visuals, getting a white board, or *something*. It's like I want to literally wrestle with the material. This is kind of how I studied in my undergrad: annotating books feverishly + typing highly organized notes in class + writing it all out on bristle boards (this is the closest with ""wrestling"" it got) + colour coded cue cards + sometimes playing audiobook versions of the books I was also reading (I studied lit)...etc etc etc etc.

Ok so. My question to you is: is ""spaced learning"" a thing? Am I misunderstanding it? Are there ressources out there?

askwomenadvice,f5a1yzn,t3_dmzf04,1572099035.0,"I am someone with insane baggage. I think that the men I date see all the work I do as a result, and all the silver linings, and are attracted to that. What sort of things do you do to heal? How have these painful experiences given meaning to your life? How do you fulfill that meaning? My conversations on dates are always very open and honest about the dark stuff in my past. But there's also a lot of talk about:

* How yoga helps me stay grounded
* How I spent a long time volunteering in rehabs and how rewarding that was
* How I forgive the family members that hurt me and how I got to this point
* My quirks and boundaries as a result of the abuse

As a women who's dated many men, what I look for in a  guy with a heavy past is:

* Is he in therapy? Has he been in therapy in the past?
* Is he self aware of how his past has affected him? 
* Is he self aware of the (more difficult) character traits he may have as a result?
* Has he learned from and changed from his last relationship?
* Is he happy with where he's at now?"
BPD,f5a07px,t3_dn9an5,1572098202.0,"Oh man. This is classic BPD? Since my diagnosis last year (I'm in my early thirties), so many quirks I thought were my own are actually just BPD lol. 

I'm pretty messy so I don't clean to start over, but I LOVE starting over. I was telling  my therapist recently that I feel at my best right after I've lost everything and have a clean slate and am starting over. It's a thrilling feeling to me.   


Ways I hit the reset button (that's what my therapist calls it):  


* breaking up with a boyfriend or taking a break from them
* Starting a new relationship/ falling in love (I guess you can't really control this but for some reason  (BPD, let's be real) this is relatively easy for me)
* throwing out belongings and replacing them with a new one,  even though there was no real reason
* Buying new outfits and clothes
* Buying new books that will show me THE WAY (do I read them? no)
* Starting fights and conflicts to disturb the peace, destroy what we have, and start back from scratch"

You have a capital r right to go home while this gets handled. Is he intimidating you? Is he controlling? Is he threatening you?"
