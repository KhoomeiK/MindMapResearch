InsanePeopleQuora,fnusv6x,t3_g3o4el,1587270192.0,this seems like the parent is trying to prevent things like her child actually growing up rather than to punish them for something
The100,fnusdqo,t3_fuql4h,1587269835.0,"it’s just creative license but good questions!
when you say earth oceans were shown to be all dried up was this when they were looking down in the final scenes at earth bc maybe the writers could just say that on the other side there was still a bit of ocean left if fans asked haha"
The100,fnurxro,t1_flmo0md,1587269513.0,most things are answered tho.
The100,fnurvcz,t1_flmojv0,1587269464.0,what makes you think this
The100,fnurrwu,t3_fpmqqq,1587269393.0,it was briefly explained that it is called shallow valley which mean that it was so low that the wave of radiation missed it. it just went right over it and only the radiation in the atmosphere killed all of the villagers not madi
The100,fnurlzp,t3_fy9lgw,1587269275.0,he was a crazy serial killer so it didn’t need to be explained that he probably had some emotional issues where he may have latched on to abby and saw kane as a threat. he wanted abby off meds and abby being on meds is what kept her seeing vincent.
The100,fnurcx9,t1_fllbt5j,1587269093.0,when did octavia say bellamy loves clarke i don’t remember sorry
The100,fnura56,t1_flhshoh,1587269040.0,echo seems like a very self aware character so maybe she will question hers and bellamys relationship now that they are all on the same side but then again it’s all up to the writers and we are only getting 16 eps in season 7 so i doubt they will waste what precious time they have on echos character development
The100,fnuqxzu,t1_flp2omu,1587268799.0,bad writing and not enough screen time. i really don’t think it would have been that hard to do a joint episode of spacekru and clarke and madis journey as clarke was speaking to bellamy every day...
The100,fnuqs7g,t3_foe5p9,1587268685.0,wouldn’t have been nice to see how becho became to be as it was only mentioned when echo said something along the lines of its took you two years to trust me’ to bellamy. which i presume means after two years of being on the ring they hooked up?
The100,fnuql0o,t3_fzn6cq,1587268540.0,i think they actually mentioned this when preparing for the second wave of praimfaya they said that if echo hadn’t blown mt weather up they wouldn’t have to work on the camp arkadia
The100,fnuqfb8,t3_fn3djm,1587268427.0,this is a really good theory that makes sense but i think the writers wanted to move on from earth and it was made possible by them saying ‘well i guess valley just didn’t spring back to life oh well it either would have or wouldn’t have and it didn’t’ i don’t think it was really ever explained i think it just is what is sadly
The100,fnuq4ls,t1_fl9byop,1587268210.0,i think it was just bait to grab the audience’s attention that could easily be explained as a radioactive monkey escaped from the zoo when the bombs went off or so on...
The100,fnupsd0,t1_fmpuhb0,1587267970.0,irl? how do people know this
