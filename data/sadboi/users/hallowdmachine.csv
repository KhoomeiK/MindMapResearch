I don't know about running my own company. It doesn't really interest me right now. That may change later on.

Most of the work is pretty common sense, if you're mechanically inclined at all. You'll need to be comfortable using basic hand tools. Hammer, screwdrivers, drill, things like that. Being mildly ambidextrous is a plus. Basic math skills are required.

If ""don't have good DIY skills"" means you somehow managed to burn your house down trying to hang a shelf on the wall, that may be a problem. If it means you've never hacked IKEA furniture into a water-cooled standing desk with Dolby surround sound, I think you'll be okay."

Locksmith,fqr9bhn,t1_fqr1pzx,1589580008.0,"Through a series of questionable life choices, I found myself working as a line cook in a restaurant making shit money. This was okay (well, mostly) when I was single but then I met my now wife and the job just wasn't going to cut it anymore. I was idly scrolling through Indeed.com one day and saw a job posting for a locksmith. I'd never really considered the field before but I figured I didn't have much to lose.

The hiring process was... odd. After the interview, the shop narrowed it down to me and another guy. They went with the other guy because I had a job at the time and he did not. Well, he didn't work out and eventually they called me on. That was about seven months ago. The business owners kindly pay me a living wage while I learn and I've picked it up well enough that I've gotten a couple of raises so far.

As for the knees, mine weren't that great to begin with. I had ACL reconstruction some years ago on one knee and because I was an idiot and didn't follow through with physical therapy, I overcompensated with and fucked over the other one. It's hard to work on a door knob without kneeling down. On one of my first solo jobs replacing some hardware I had to adjust the mortices for the latch and strike plates because the new ones had square corners and the old ones had rounded corners.

Climbing in and out of my van, up and down step ladders working on door closers, etc. It's not an overly physical job but it has its moments. Oh, and if you end up working in a shop, you might have a customer come wanting a dozen copies of a key. You'll feel that in your neck after staring down at the key duplicator for so long (if they're manual machines).

I still have a lot to learn but I like my job and don't see myself switching to another industry. I get to work with my hands, there are problems to solve that sometimes require thinking outside of the box, and I genuinely feel good when I can help a customer. I doubt I'll strike it rich but as long as I can pay my bills and keep a roof over my family's head, I'll be happy."
