IWantToLearn,exm0yjw,t3_ctkbpw,1566422610.0,"It’s a journey. Go for whatever you think you’ll at least decently enjoy. That pays your bills and save a bit for other goals while you find a routine for you. And don’t stress about work at home. If it’s your business or your the creator, try to remember to take time for yourself. And if you get stressed as a the creator from that at home work, just move on to something else and hand it off to someone you see that will treat it properly and enjoy it. The world is forever changing anyways. Just learn to have fun during the journey. Pay attention to what makes you feel good. And that can change for some people at times. Live, learn and enjoy the ride."

You can do it! Believe in yourself!"

ptsd,evfcd24,t3_cjbo7b,1564493233.0,"I do the same thing. Whenever I feel real down and out or just lost in an emotion that grabs a hold of me and sinks my attitude. I visit the cows by the pasture, near my place. They’re special creatures to me. I don’t know why exactly they calm me, except that I enjoy their subtleness and calamity while alive on the same planet as me. My gemini sign is actually Taurus too. It’s sorta like reflective meditation to me. Without processing to many thoughts at a time."
