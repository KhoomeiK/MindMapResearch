sad,fqwriq8,t3_gl7j94,1589715194.0,"I wish it was only ""right now."" 

Everything's either terrible or it's this. Half a mock up facsimile of contentedness. Nothing's ever really fine."
depression,fqwqaws,t3_exo6f1,1589713949.0,"It's scary watching everyone's expectations rise and the support withdraw as i struggle my way a few rungs up the ladder.

It's like everyone can't wait for me to improve even slightly, to pull the rug out and say ""you're fine now, get out there."" It's making it a lot harder to focus on recovery and determine whether i even am improving."
depression,fqwpp03,t3_gl1vmv,1589713310.0,"All the time. I can't even blame people, it's just...no one has any answers. No one has a solution.

The best medical professionals are still relatively stumbling around in the dark in terms of what help they can provide."
depression,fn5812o,t3_exo6f1,1586658156.0,"Turning 28 on Saturday and I feel like i've only ever experienced maybe 28% of life. 
I can't relate to people talking about anything that isn't anxiety, misery or anger.

If my depression was cured tomorrow, it'd still be too late for me to learn how to have a life."
AskReddit,fmabyfo,t3_ftny3x,1585889334.0,"Don't want to seem melodramatic but you did ask. I attempted suicide again tonight. I'm not doing well at all. 

Not really because of the isolation, i've been living like that for years, but this was going to be the year i turn it all around...Not just in a new year's resolution way but i actually had stuff booked, speed dating, gigs, therapy and social events...all indefinitely postponed now...i don't think i can keep waiting for a life worth living anymore...but i evidently can't quit it either despite my best efforts. 

Again, sorry if that's a bit much. I'm not as in control as i'd like to be recently."
depression,fm9eugp,t3_exo6f1,1585867288.0,I feel like my brain is bleeding. It hurts to think and everything i think about just makes me more depressed or anxious. It's like pushing down on a bruise and i don't think there's anyone who can help anymore.
mentalhealth,fm9dsx0,t3_ftepzi,1585866693.0,"I was barely hanging on before this all happened. If this actually lasts for a year or more, i dunno what state i'm gonna be in at the end of it."
depression,fl5g90t,t3_exo6f1,1584836007.0,"I just felt angry all day today. I don't know why. Nothing happened and i didn't do anything of consequence.

Just angry and alone and restless since i woke up, wishing I never had."
depression,fjzgzll,t3_exo6f1,1583719499.0,"Hadn't self-harmed since 28th January. Broke that streak today. I couldn't even reach out to anyone except internet strangers.

I would've done more damage if I could but I can't do it. I can't do anything. For anyone."
SuicideWatch,fjxw1dk,t3_ffcy1q,1583684664.0,"I know this feeling. It's like i require 200% of any normal relationship because i just won't feel the support or emotion half the time, even if it's there.

And 200% is too much to ask of anyone but i keep foolishly believing people when they say they won't get sick of me. Everyone does eventually."
AnxietyDepression,fjw2ltb,t3_fezhfc,1583633769.0,I wish I could feel this but thank you for trying.
lonely,fj525me,t3_fbg9a2,1583022411.0,"Yeah, same. Like it's a good time mostly but it'd be nice to go out and meet people too. The latter's just never been very easy for me."
depression,fhst1qp,t3_exo6f1,1581865054.0,"I've started questioning why I even bother getting out of bed. I don't see anyone, i don't leave the house somedays.

Everyone else has got their life and at best they'll check on the broken charity case occasionally but no one wants to meet up. No one wants me in their life."
