I got made inactive at work because I just couldn’t work outside my comfort zone plus the stress of the quarantine so the boss let me sit out working during this time and stay with my parents.

And it’s driving me nuts because I need new stuff to keep myself occupied...but in order to get said stuff I need money and to get money I need to work...and i can’t work right now because I’m in quarantine!

So I’m just sitting around bored all day waiting for the next thing to catch my attention span until things are calm enough to go back to work. Desperately wondering if I should buy stuff with the money I have or not.

Normally I work as a janitor at my local grocery store but....my schedule got updated and changed because of the virus attack. My hours got extended from four hours to 6. I know that doesn't sound a big deal but...I can't deal with drastic changes like that. My anxiety kicks in and I panicked and I handled it really badly.

Long story short I was able to negotiate to be inactive at work and I can come back once things settle down.

I should just relax. Turn on a streaming service and wait this out....but I can't..

I can't stop worrying. I can't stop overthinking. 

Everything I love is at risk. Not just my family but my hobbies and interests too. Like comics, toy collecting, and other things.

It's just...TORTURE. I want to go back to having a steady stream of income so I can distract myself and satisfy my short attention span but I can't because I'm not working right now!!!!

And I'm starting to worry that we're not gonna live to see the end of the virus. Not because I'm worried I'll die from it but because I'm worried we'll run out of supplies and starve to death because of grocery store issues! And I can't stop thinking these thoughts!

I'm hoping against all rational hope that this is either over by next month or has calmed down enough so I can go back to work but I know deep down inside it probably won't....

This was supposed to be my year...the year where I put myself out more! The year where I made friends that weren't online, maybe got a girlfriend something I've been missing in my life for years

AND ITS ALL RUINED!!!!!!

transformers,fn2iyy8,t1_fn20a1s,1586590739.0,"I honestly wasn't really reading the IDW books when they first came out. Just keeping up with it on TF Wiki and reading some back issues here and there. I was kinda out of a Transformers Phase when the big Unicron finale was going on so I missed out when the end first came out

So right now I'm currently playing catch up with the old IDW continuity.

As for three things I like about the current IDW continuity...actually I'll give you more than 3.

Bumblebee's arc is pretty good(I won't spoil it though)

They gave Quake something to do for once.

It's really interesting seeing the lead up to the war instead of the middle of the war. 

Cliffjumper's Galaxies arc was fantastic

Prowl is a lot more likeable than he was in the 2005 IDW books while still being the prick we love.

Female transformers from the start."
transformers,fn1yhe6,t1_fn1w28v,1586573203.0,"Honestly from what I can tell it was time for a reboot. yes, the comics were good but it had gotten to the point where the continuity was becoming so convoluted it was hard to keep up. Plus from what I could tell they were really running out of stuff to do. Unicron was the only thing left.

Yes, the 2019 continuity has been a slow burn. But it's been an entertaining slow burn especially if you binge read the issues.

Anything specific you wanna ask?"
