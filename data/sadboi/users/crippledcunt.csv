depression,fhem0hl,t3_f2qwaw,1581525208.0,"I know how you feel, everything seems hard and pointless. I can only recommend looking at your situation and analyse what is making you feel that way. For me, it was my parents.   


If it is in your environment, like friends or family or your work, try to get rid of it as soon as possible.   


The reason may be because of you and for that, I suggest talking to someone. It's ok if it's ur cat or dog or even in the mirror. You don't need anyone to give you an answer. Sometimes, just talking about the problem makes it a little easier and it can be just enough for you to find what you need to change about yourself. And most of the time, just changing your approach to the world can change it all.   


I hope I provided enough help for you, or at least, some inspiration."

The hardest step is to see what we have to improve, which you already did, so good job!

I am always trying to better myself and I don't go to a therapist or anything. My boyfriend and I are supporting eachother and we help one another to improve ourselves so maybe having a friend or someone close to help you. Plus, it's free and you get to deepen the relationship with that person and exchange any kind of love and compassion.


I wish you the best! :)"
