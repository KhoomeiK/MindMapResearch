OCD,fpifhk0,t1_fphpj5n,1588639834.0,"I think a lot of us are right there with you. My HA and OCD have been through the freaking roof...

I help take care of my elderly grandparents and was tested for Covid last week, negative, but I’m already convinced I’ve caught it between then and now...

The relief is short lived with OCD"

JordanPeterson,fn6rees,t3_fzxal5,1586705837.0,"This is so funny to be searching for an update on the good Dr. and to see this posted less than an hour ago.

I haven’t heard anything but I genuinely hope he emerges soon. I know he’s been dealing with some rough stuff in regards to anxiety, depression, etc. 

I (like a lot of you, probably) deal with the same things. 

This virus hasn’t been easy on anyone, and certainly hasn’t spared the anxious."
OCD,fn5hxsj,t3_fkpqcu,1586665337.0,"I’ve been struggling with the exact same thing. I dealt with fairly severe OCD and GAD when I was younger and it’s flared back up (in a huge way) due to obvious reasons.

My new OCD ritual, for the last 3 weeks or so, is to forcefully exhale and listen to the “wheeze” sound to determine if it sounds restricted or if it makes me cough. 

Initially, I thought, “If I can forcefully exhale and not cough, surely I’m fine...” 

OCD makes no sense, I know. 

Ironically, I’m pretty sure I’ve irritated my windpipe by doing this so often and now it’s legitimately bothering me. 

So, I’m constantly taking deep breathes, forcefully exhaling, and even having dreams about coughing and chest congestion. 

Anxiety is absolutely terrible in the best of times and borderline crippling right now. 

I feel for you and am here to chat if you need someone."
Anxiety,fmiifoi,t1_flmdxrf,1586110206.0,"I’m right there with you. Every day it’s something different right now. It’s like my “symptom” machine resets each night when I fall asleep. 

I’ve purposely “pushed” all the air out of my lungs dozens of times at this point to make sure that, even that, doesn’t make me cough. 

I catch myself doing it and am reminded of an OCD ridden 13 year old “me” and it’s genuinely sad. 

There have been multiple times, again...dozens, where I’ve convinced myself I’m sick to the point of near panic.

Praying for everyone dealing with Covid in any way, even the fear and anxiety surrounding the virus can be debilitating, especially for those of us that deal with crippling anxiety in the best of times.

I’m always here if anyone needs to vent (as long as I can vent right back ;)"
Anxiety,fmihhcf,t3_fo6h6w,1586109663.0,Yep. Right here. Me. 100000X me...
COVID19_support,fluh2lt,t3_fqqytz,1585502457.0,"I’m right there with you, friend.

I’ve had the wildest few weeks of anxiety that I’ve ever experienced and have gone from “I need to go get tested now” to “Don’t be ridiculous, idiot...”

I’ve talked about it SO much to my parents and girlfriend that they’re all getting upset with me and it’s putting a real strain on our relationship (parents and girlfriend). 

I’m not “present” any more due to overwhelming anxiety, paranoia, hypochondria, and fear. 

I’ve been taking long walks (with a weighted vest to make it as hard as possible) to take my mind off everything and those have worked great until today, when the several mile hike didn’t do much for the worry. It’s amazing when the thought “What If my worry doesn’t get better while {insert coping mechanism here} like it has in the past?” comes to your mind and, voila, {insert coping mechanism} magically doesn’t work anymore...

Anxiety is such a nasty condition.

The past day or so I’ve begun to get very dizzy, experiencing ringing in my ears, and woke up several times last night in a cold sweat, heart racing.

I’m not saying all of this to get a pity party but to hopefully offer comfort that there are people (likely a TON) that are dealing with the exact same thing you are. 

Hang in there. Always happy to talk, as I’m sure everyone else here is, too."
Anxiety,flug10a,t3_fqsyck,1585501864.0,"This is very interesting. I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now and the dizziness still surprises me, and of course, leads to more anxiety.

Mine has recently “ramped” back up and I’m having to come to grips with it again. It’s not easy to convince yourself that it’s “just anxiety” because the sensation is so real. 

I’ve also notice the pressure in the head feeling along with ringing in my ears. 

Have you experienced those as well?"
Breath_of_the_Wild,flho1zy,t1_flgqgv3,1585166285.0,"I was about to say the exact same thing.

I’d say most of us DO care. This game has brought my 7 year old little boy and I together in more ways than I can count. 

I’m tearing up writing this, but that’s ok ;)

So glad you were able to get a Switch and experience such an awesome work of art with us!"
zoloft,fl6yzgb,t3_fhqm87,1584888546.0,"Guys, I’m right there with you. 

I began taking Zoloft when I was ~16 (OCD, intrusive thoughts, anxiety) and am now 33. 

I actually quit cold turkey over a year ago and hadn’t looked back. 

Then comes Coronavirus. 

I spent hours a day (I’d been watching it unfold since January) reading about it. 

Hour after hour after hour. 

I literally worked myself into a borderline psychotic state and didn’t know what to do. 

I realized I had Zoloft “leftover” and decided to call my doc and ask if I could jump back on to try and save what little bit of mental capacity I had left. 

He said that would be fine and to start low (I have 100 tabs so I split into 50) and begin taking them consistently again.

Day 1 was ok, Day 2 was an onslaught of panic, day 3 I was convinced I was having a heart attack and last night began chilling, dizzy spells, and convincing myself I had a fever (I didn’t and still don’t to my knowledge). 

I am at my wits end. 

My brain is swimming, my stomach is gurgling, my legs are weak, I’m exhausted but can’t sleep, no appetite, and have convinced myself I’m actually sick.

This is such a horrible idea."
