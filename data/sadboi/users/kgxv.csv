It’s *because* the cop performed perfectly fine that there’s more than enough justification to mention race when there have been countless videos of people of color doing objectively less than this woman and being brutalized (or gunned down) right then and there.  

The only reason there’s debate is because you, for some reason, took it upon yourself to say something as silly as you did.

It doesn’t matter if TDM is a less efficient game mode, it’s the only acceptable game mode for people grinding challenges if they’re not going to play the objective as well.  If you want to cap the flag and then go run through five guys via longshot that’s totally fine.  

But if you just sit in the corner and ignore the objective and get your teammates killed because you’re focused on yourself and yourself alone, no other context matters because you’re just an asshole.

As for your idea of us playing similarly, I’m always down to link up with people who will actually play the objective.  Back before MW came out and I basically only played WWII of recent COD games, I tried to make a discord to connect people who actually played the objective on War instead of the losers who acted like it was TDM, but by the time people started joining WWII wasn’t played much anymore.  

I’d be happy to put a group/regiment together of people who actually play the objective."
