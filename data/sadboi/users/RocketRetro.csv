Idk if it depends on where you live but I thought it was on the national level. Have you found any communities or resources to help you in this time?

SuicideWatch,fqto2i6,t3_gk7spi,1589642742.0,"In Buddhism, ending one’s suffering is circular thought. You may be suffering now but life is always suffering, no matter what life you are in.  The best course of action is to make the best of what you have. There will always be suffering, we have to learn how to deal with it rather than to run away. It is impossible to eliminate entirely.

Have you ever seen a therapist or spoken to your family about what you’re going through? I know you may say you’re not depressed but the way how you view life itself may mean that you are. At least to me, part of depression is finding life lacking any meaning. Anyway, I read that about Buddhism the other day and it got me thinking, that by ending this life are we really guaranteed something better? I guess that sounds bitter sweet, but what I’m trying to say, even though it may seem cliche to you, is that I hope you do get some help and that you see brighter days in the future. ❤️"

SuicideWatch,fqhw5gt,t1_fqhvtcn,1589385640.0,"Yeah that’s true also. I guess not like a close friend but I guess it’s still good to have someone to talk to. And oh how come your guidance counselor told your parents? Is it possible to have those convos remain anonymous? Also I have to ask just out of concern but when you say “trouble”, do you mean abuse either physically or verbally?"
SuicideWatch,fqhviss,t1_fqhsmc8,1589385330.0,"Yeah I totally understand. What about your teachers tho and guidance counselors? My sister used to hate the immaturity in the high school we went to and she would always have lunch with the teachers upstairs. They were pretty cool about it and saw she was more mature so they liked having convos with her. Maybe the kids your age aren’t a your type of group yet, at least most of them it seems like. I’m sure there are some people around your age that will care for you like a true friend but it might just take time to find them. It’s ok that’s a lot of high schools. In the meantime since teachers are adults and you seems to be pretty mature are there any of them you talk to or that you consider to be friends?"
SuicideWatch,fqhs87w,t1_fqhncer,1589383425.0,I’m sorry. Does your family know about your issues though and how it makes you feel suicidal? I think your friends also need to hear from you why you think they aren’t being good friends. I don’t want to assume you’re in high school but to be honest the response your friends have makes me think they are very immature. Either that or they shouldn’t be your friends anymore if they’re not helping.
SuicideWatch,fqh8ozb,t3_gins3m,1589371179.0,I’m sorry op. Those aren’t true friends if they say things like that. How’s your family though? Are they supportive?

Anyway no one really knows if their problems are forever. Somethings can be, but others not so much. It may take time for a problem, which seems to be permanent, to be resolved. Regardless, yes acceptance is good too. But that also falls in line with what I said. If you’ve learn to accept your problem, then doesn’t that mean it was temporary? If it doesn’t bother you anymore because you’ve accepted it, or you’ve learned to deal with it, it becomes even less of a problem."

SuicideWatch,fq4q55s,t3_ggl3c4,1589081599.0,"Well I look at it this way; suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The alternate solution(for living) however varies per individual. It’s hard for us to give anyone a solution when we really don’t know them that well. Heck, if we could give a solution think of all the people we’d be saving already. Honestly the way I see is that all people can do is help each other out a little bit every day. Whether it’s advice or lending an ear for listening, these are all small parts of a “solution” that may take weeks or months to complete. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t have the full picture yet.

I try not to let that happen as often as I realize that happiness shouldn’t be in the future. It’s in the now, right now as we speak. There is always something to appreciate. I found it kind of liberating because looking to the future can be so nerve wracking especially when something seems so far off. And if video games and other hobbies don’t fill the void, maybe try something new, something that is easy enough to start but takes time to perfect. Games for me like Minecraft and animal crossing take time and honestly you get a sort of attachment when building these worlds over time. It doesn’t have to be video games of course.
