askwomenadvice,f11s2ye,t3_d7a7tp,1569129779.0,There are a lot of guys in this world who will say anything to try to lure you into bed with them. I had a guy tell me he thinks I‚Äôm the one/he‚Äôs falling in love with me already and the first night we met and then started asking for sex like 10 minuets later.
relationship_advice,f0kr3rv,t3_d4xn2j,1568685928.0,I should‚Äôve left my ex the first time he cheated or even talked about wanting to have sex with other girls to his friends but my stupid ass stayed because my self worth was low. FUCK THAT. one day you will meet someone who isn‚Äôt going to fuck you over and is going to treat you right. The disrespect she has for telling her friends in the group chat. She clearly doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings. She won‚Äôt change. The love you thought you had will never be able to be rebuilt.

psychology,ey62ghi,t3_cvox5z,1566845881.0,"This is so true. My first time going to therapy these last few weeks.

Idk about you but I do look for husband material in a man because I want to raise kids. Would you want to live a life where your husband throws a fit and refuses to get you a tampon? Probably not. You probably want to marry a man who gets up and helps you out, and is gentle with you and your feelings."

Been doing everything on my own since I was 17, but my mom recently reached out to help. I‚Äôm in a fake relationship sometimes it feels like that because he is only focused on his music career. He‚Äôs been telling me for the last 2 months he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship or doesn‚Äôt prioritize me, and I haven‚Äôt listened until today. It‚Äôs been 3 years so it‚Äôs hard to let some things go. Even though he said he loved me, he completely switched up. I think things are going to be ok though. I think if we break up I might be more at peace because he‚Äôs a big part of my mental health being shitty. I know he cares, but he has a weird way of showing it lately.

AskReddit,exukovm,t3_cuctl4,1566584934.0,"I will wonder if my boyfriend of 3 years was real. I would probably try to find him online first. I probably wouldn‚Äôt leave my little sister with my mom, because when I moved to my dads in 8th grade she ran to his truck, hugged me and told me not to go. My dad ended up being really abusive and crazy. I wanted to move back home but my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me. I would probably finish high school, but if I knew my boyfriend was real I would move back to my college town. I would find him. I would be different. Smarter, kinder, maybe my mental health would be better since I knew how to future would play out. I would do everything again with him. I would be able to watch out for our bad arguments since I already lived them."

AstralProjection,ewkus8b,t3_con9an,1565495251.0,"So the other week I believe this happened to me, and I got scared. My body started to vibrate as it does when I am having sleep paralysis or lucid dream, and I heard mound ringing in my ears, like Tibet bowls almost. I thought I felt a presence next to me and I was afraid. I didn‚Äôt want to look at what was next to me. I started to feel my soul leave my body. I didn‚Äôt look back at my body, instead I left the room. I started floating up into the sky, and I could see down on to the land I was on. My soul kept floating and I was afraid. I thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready yet‚Äù because it felt like I was going up into heaven. I started to try and move my physical body until I snapped out of it. When I realized there was nothing actually next to me, I wish I didn‚Äôt snap out of it. Of course I couldn‚Äôt go back though. Moment was over"

BPD,evxtf3n,t3_clrtxp,1564906826.0,"It‚Äôs so odd how our mind can tell us such terrible things that make us feel so deeply. Our mind tells us we aren‚Äôt good enough, which makes us want to cry. The thoughts in our head are intrusive, and sometimes feel almost uncontrollable. They sneak up on you in the worst moments, when you‚Äôre just trying to chill and have fun with friends or alone. It sucks. I know it‚Äôs not just people with BPD who struggle with this. I know someone without BPD that can have thoughts that make them think they are unattractive when they are very attractive. The mind is a weird thing. Something we all need to learn in this life is how to take control. The mind can easily take control of us. We must learn how to reverse these thoughts. Stop these thoughts. Pink Floyd said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs someone in my head, but it‚Äôs not me.‚Äù I know myself wouldn‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm a failure, but sometimes my head does. Who is that thought? Where does that random thought come from. Consciousness is a complex thing."

The first time I did shrooms, I saw everything as so beautiful. I felt like god/my higher self was talking to me. I saw that he made my boyfriend for me. When I did acid, I was out of my ego. I wondered why I was so crazy. I was with my boyfriend and he said ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre not, you just have to realize what‚Äôs in your head and take control.‚Äù And while tripping, I felt like what was in my head was put in front of me, and I was able to observe everything. Past childhood experiences came up and I cried, but it was okay.  It was a good cry. Because that was inside of me anyways, staying mustered up in a ball. I was letting go. Ever since I tripped, I see the world as beautiful. Nature mostly. Nature is amazing to me. The way the trees intertwine. The beautiful colors from all the different plants. The clouds in the sky. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing really. I know I didn‚Äôt use to see the world like this. It didn‚Äôt cure me fully of course. I still have a lot of work to do. But I truly believe it changed my life for the better. I was able to come out of my ego. If you‚Äôre there with her, and see her starting to get overwhelmed, guide her, be gentle with her, hold her and take deep breaths with her. It‚Äôs a beautiful journey everyone should embark in their life at least once. Good luck üíô"
