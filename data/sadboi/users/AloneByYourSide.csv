TalkTherapy,fn8k9q1,t1_fn88q91,1586743564.0,"I don't really watch TV or movies either so I'm in the same boat as you. I'll have to check them out though, maybe it'll give me a more realistic idea on how it's really supposed to be. Really appreciate you taking the time to help explain this to me, it means a lot!"
TalkTherapy,fn883gm,t1_fn86406,1586735911.0,"Oh wow really? Gosh I’ve always had the idea that just letting love come naturally is always key. Maybe I do have the same idea though, since my idea is to just be doing your own thing and see that special someone and make your move. But I had no idea that flirting is considered “exhilarating”, probably since all I’ve ever had was anxiety and doubt when I’ve done it haha."
TalkTherapy,fn7zi2w,t1_fn7pkjx,1586730779.0,"That makes a lot of sense. I’m not into dating apps at all nor do I need them, I just hated the idea of feeling like I have to forcefully go up to women and meet them, which seems like a very forced idea and not natural at all, in which natural is exactly what I want. Kinda like when it’s just the right moment lined up to where I’m able to approach someone and introduce myself, not where I have to chase that person down just because I think they’re attractive. Maybe that’s what my T meant, and I just missed it, but to me it seemed like he meant something else."
TalkTherapy,fn7oxaf,t1_fn7j5r5,1586724683.0,"So it's basically that I've been using this ""dating app"" (more like app to meet friends) recently and I was asking him about what it would be like to use this app in a healthy way or what the dating world is like for someone who is healthy. He started to tell me about a study where only about 30 of 100 people in a study where a guy went out and asked for girls numbers on an escalator said yes to going out with him, basically saying that it's not always going to work out, but I have to be determined. I then got the idea that this is the only way to meet girls and to find a girlfriend, which really made me upset because my dream has always been to meet my future significant other in a very natural way, not a way that's forced. I told him that, and he seemed to think my idea was a bad idea, which led me to get really defensive. I normally am always very open to everything my T has to say advice wise, but this really hit me for some reason. He told me that if I want to find my s/o, I'm gonna have to start approaching girls that I see in public and striking up a conversation and asking them out that way. That idea just doesn't at all sound appealing to me, since the way I wanna do it is just naturally, like meeting her through a group of friends or in some other way, but my therapist basically told me that that's just an unrealistic idea and made it seem like that his way is the only way I could do it. He always talks about things being black and white and with this he didn't really give me much grey area to believe that there could be another way for me to meet my s/o. I didn't make much of a deal of it after that because he just seemed pretty set on his opinion of this and I didn't wanna push it. It's been bugging me ever since, and I know he may have meant it in another way, but it just didn't seem like that to me."
TalkTherapy,fn7ir2u,t1_fn26jzi,1586721145.0,"Sorry about that. If I went any further to explain it, it would be a TL:DR. How would I approach this to him? I always feel bad complaining about the way I've been treated since I don't wanna be a burden."
Dissociation,fjdojmg,t1_fjdemmw,1583256177.0,"I've realized that. I got way too high the last time I smoked and it was like I didn't even exist. My mind was 98% gone and life just didn't even happen then. The effects double for me when I do it, so that's why I don't smoke at all anymore. It's really horrible. I'm not sure if that's what you meant."
Dissociation,fjdoate,t1_fjd4jes,1583256043.0,"Ah I can see why that happens. If I smoke my effect ends up doubling, so I'm double not in reality. Best of luck on your recovery though!"
Dissociation,fjdo66a,t1_fjd4351,1583255971.0,Wow that's so crazy. I'm glad you know about it now though. I'm surprised some people live with it for almost their whole lives and don't even notice it.
Dissociation,fjdo1fn,t1_fjcor5v,1583255900.0,That's crazy. So you act drunk because of dissociation?
Dissociation,fjdo045,t1_fjchqxp,1583255880.0,Oh wow. That's one way to do it for sure. I've almost wanted to do the same thing sometimes when I say the wrong thing or it just sounds completely dumb but my friends know I don't smoke lol.
Dissociation,fjdmqai,t1_fjclp69,1583255482.0,That's so interesting. Same thing with depression I'm assuming?
Dissociation,fjc81ry,t3_fcp597,1583211165.0,"I've always found it easy to have the person I'm telling imagine what it feels like to watch a POV video (like a person wearing a go pro on their head) and to relate it to that. I usually start it off with saying ""life feels like I'm watching my life through a computer screen"" and then continuing it with something like ""have you ever seen those videos with people wearing go pros on their head, and how those videos make you feel like you're watching life through their eyes? Well that's how I feel about everything in life. After I think about a moment that happened it almost seems like it wasn't my life when thinking about it."" That's my way to explain it, and not many people may ever fully understand what it's like to have dissociation, but for me I found this way helpful."
depression,fj5nhya,t1_fj5mhuw,1583037265.0,That makes sense! It's almost like losing your other half of yourself. I just need to find things to do to push myself to get out there. I've been struggling lately with unmotivation as well and social anxiety so it's been hard to pursue new things.

therapy,firdusf,t1_fiqr712,1582662506.0,"That's so great. I'd be seeing my therapist 8 times a month so it's great that he's not charging me as much. It means that I couldn't be able to pay rent for a room, but hey, living in my car shouldn't be so bad if that's what it needs to come to."
therapy,firdlcq,t1_fiq6ryb,1582662363.0,So you think what my T suggested was something I should go for? And thank you!

It's so great how there's people out there who care enough about their job to literally jeopardize thousands of dollars just to make sure someone can get better.

TalkTherapy,fipefwz,t1_fip4669,1582604637.0,"That's so amazing! And thank you! It just really puts in perspective of how much some therapists don't just care about the money, but about their patients, and how hard they are to find, and how much they should be cherished.

sad,fij0roo,t3_f83fx1,1582431932.0,From my experiences with this I can tell you it could be anything. The mind is such a confusing thing when it has depression and other mental sorrows. That's why I think an EMDR therapist or an IFS therapist is your best bet. If you don't know what those are they basically take action on helping you understand what's going on and to fix it. I'm doing it currently and it's been life changing.
sad,fij0gsy,t3_f84bzk,1582431697.0,You're crying because that was just such a letdown. I'm sorry that happened. Was it a good reason to do such a thing?

offmychest,fij0brm,t1_fiiustb,1582431587.0,"That's fair. I felt like that for a while too. Maybe it's not so much of a ""soulmate"" but more as someone who you just connect with so well. Almost like you both were meant for each other."

offmychest,fij03jh,t1_fiisnby,1582431405.0,Dang seems like you feel the same as I do. That feeling of just not wanting someone cause you know you couldn't handle loving someone is a terrible feeling. Are you experiencing numbness too?
offmychest,fiis4y2,t3_f82xb7,1582425598.0,"Look for signs if they feel the same about you. It may be hard since they don't like your gender, but you can always be aware. Another thing is if this person is chill enough and appreciates your friendship enough to still be friends with you even if they reject you. Maybe you can try and ask some questions on if they would be upset if something like this were to happen."

Dissociation,fi19iax,t1_fi0ttff,1582053313.0,"Very true! My friends try and be as supportive as they can even if they don't understand, but it's hard sometimes when you feel like they don't care enough to understand as well."

depression,fh6d73s,t3_f1djgl,1581297495.0,"I feel like this from time to time. And I kinda learned why. Depression for some people is a safe space. A place for people to go when they are scared and don't know how to feel or what to do. People feel like isolation and feeling depressed is always a place to go when nothing feels like there's hope, almost like a drug addict always going back when they feel like they need the drug."
Dissociation,fh6catx,t3_f1emgp,1581297168.0,"I was just doing this the other day. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't fully convince myself. It's so weird how I'm not the only one experiencing this. It always feels like I am since it's not common."
ADHD,fh6blsj,t1_fh5d72r,1581296982.0,Agreed! You should only take what's necessary is what I always say. It won't ever turn out well if you chase the feeling.
ADHD,fh6bd1j,t1_fh585qo,1581296922.0,"It's a great feeling that's so tempting to chase, but since I only take it 1-2 times a week I just enjoy it while it lasts. I wouldn't ever exceed that just to chase the high, but that's just because of my bad past experiences of chasing good feelings from drugs."
ADHD,fh6ay9a,t1_fh5feez,1581296848.0,"Hey I'm glad I could help you think a bit! I agree, it's not so much euphoric as it is just like ""today may not suck actually."" I usually take one 15 mg dose of Adderall every time I need to do homework, so for me it's about once or twice a week. I think it's so intense for me because I usually hate taking it and try my best to not take it if I don't have to. It's nice, but lasts very shortly. 

I would say for you it just depends on the dosage and how much of a tolerance your body has built up to it, just like any other drug. No matter how long you haven't taken it and decide to take it again though, it'll still only last about 4-5 hours. I've had mine go for around 8, but that was only because I was so focused on finishing a final paper. It all just depends.

If you are gonna consider upping your dose, start slow. I made the mistake of not taking it for a month and then taking a 20 mg pill. That made me feel horrible afterwards. Again though, it just all depends."
ADHD,fh57yof,t1_fg8bke5,1581285949.0,A little late but I figured it out. I had a big mean before I had one and didn't know that you're supposed to take it before meals. It had a hard time digesting with all the food I just ate.

I guess I was just curious to see what she would do and so far it's just nothing, which is even weirder than her adding me in the first place. If nothing happens I may just use your method."
Dissociation,fgg2jl8,t3_ey2yy2,1580752863.0,Very accurate. Was looking at myself in the mirror the other day and I didn't seem like a real person. I just felt like that wasn't me in that mirror and it was somebody else. Dpdr is real.
relationship_advice,fgeuh25,t1_fgethvy,1580710456.0,Glad you stood up for yourself and his fiance! Exes can definitely do weird things. Not sure what's in store for me for this but it should be interesting. It's awkward right now but still weird enough to where I can get a good laugh.
relationship_advice,fgetees,t1_fget5ws,1580709328.0,Definitely not. I didn't even have any intention of messaging her again because she kinda annoyed me in the first place (hence why she's my ex lol.) I just added her back to see what she would do but so far it's nothing. I've never been in this situation so I didn't know if I should text her at all to confront her on why she added me out of the blue.
relationship_advice,fget95l,t1_fget4nm,1580709182.0,Very true. I'm not sure what her intentions are but I probably shouldn't chase like you said.

offmychest,fdskmr8,t3_en09db,1578704381.0,I feel you. I said that to myself too and I got help to fix it. You can definitely do it. Rewiring your brain is 100% doable.

EMDR,fa05n6p,t3_e78fcj,1575749298.0,"EMDR is great even with a little bit of trauma. I'm also going though school right now while doing EMDR therapy and I feel your struggle, it tends to get in the way. What I've found is that even if you don't have as much trauma as you think you do it can still help you to clear your bad thinking patterns and to better yourself. If you haven't given it enough time yet I suggest you do, but I get it, I've felt like it wasn't for me either and that school was a big conflict with it, but really once you open up your mind to it and accept that it will only benefit you for the future it'll make things a lot easier. As much as you may not want to, try and talk to your therapist now and tell him how you feel. It may help a lot to have some communication."

Dissociation,f9k1iyd,t1_f9j5du7,1575390754.0,"Yeah it really does help. Like it can change a life from someone who has this kind of disorder. I'd suggest checking into it if you are interested in therapy. I've tried my shot at 6 other regular ""so tell me about your problems"" therapists and EMDR is the only one that works for me lol. Appreciate you wishing me good luck on my grades, I'm doing decently well for my first year of college and with all this going on. I've also experienced depression hardcore for 6 years so I know what it's like. I'm sorry you have to go through that. It's probably one of the worst things a human can feel.

Honestly, all those drugs ever did was bring more problems to the surface like you said, so I think it's best I stay away from them completely. I'll heal on my own. I'm just glad it wasn't too late before I noticed. Thank you for pointing that out, that was something I will definitely keep in mind."
Drugs,f5qztwo,t1_f5qzd5a,1572385795.0,"My symptoms are much better now, which is why I think it's safe to say I don't need medication anymore which is nice since having to deal with finding the right one was a pain. I was morally just curious about why it seems like all drugs have some sort of bad effect on me, but I think it may be because we all react differently to them."
Drugs,f5qz4r1,t1_f5qyakp,1572385470.0,CBD is nice. I've tried that. I think that's one of the only things that hasn't messed with my head.
Drugs,f5qz0d1,t1_f5qymey,1572385417.0,Yeah they're all via prescription. I've taken them to try and help with my problems that I have but they've never been a successful solution.
Drugs,f5qysu6,t3_dovxl0,1572385324.0,"In my opinion, I don't agree with taking every day. Hell, I don't even think you should take it at all if you only experience negative effects or don't have bad ADD/ADHD. I have recently tried to get off mine cause it wasn't for me, but everyone has their own experiences with it. Research says it's not good to take it every day as it can affect the brain and cause some liver problems over some time. It's also not good to rely on it. As another person said, I don't think you should ever give it to your child either. Young developing minds on Adderall will only inhibit their growth."
Drugs,f5qy9ss,t1_f5qrwek,1572385079.0,I've recently been trying to get off of it as well. 5 days clean so far. What's helped you the most if you don't mind me asking?
offmychest,f5m00ev,t1_f5lzrqt,1572285197.0,So nice of you to offer. That would be awesome.
offmychest,f5lzu82,t1_f5ly7p2,1572285151.0,"That's one thing I've learned. Worry about yourself. Cause in the end, yourself the only one who will stick by your side, not anyone else, right?"
