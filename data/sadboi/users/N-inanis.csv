These are rough times for all of us.
I hope in the future our museums will assure safety of artifacts."

NoStupidQuestions,fkley70,t3_fj1odh,1584304865.0,"Can people in Italy take their dogs out to pee/poo? 
Not for a walk, but just to do their business?

I have a dog and I am worried my neighbours will call the cops on me, and I will get a fine if I take my dog out to pee in my yard.

I am asking because our government hinted that our country will be in quarantine soon."
BPD,fjxa3m9,t3_fcd0yr,1583664176.0,Same. I am so done with this. Why keep going?
BPD,fjx9y4g,t3_ferpg1,1583663943.0,Isn't this normal for BPD? I feel that way too. I hate aging and getting older. It scares me. I wish I could be 10 again.. I wish I could play with my toys.. Everything used to be so small back then. But big at the same time? I can't explain it.. I hate this
BPD,fjx9qtp,t3_fdgszh,1583663648.0,That's why I never had any social media to begin with. It would destroy me. Thank god 11 year old me had crippling social anxiety and was too scared to create a facebook account.

gachagaming,fca0d7f,t3_egmjma,1577560914.0,"Hello!

I have been playing the same four gacha games for months now, I'd love to add at least one more game to this list.. Need something fresh. For my addiction.

The games are:
-Blustone two
-Love Nikki
-Crash Fever
-Astral Chronicles

What I want:
-It can be a well known game or not
-New or old is both okay
-Any type of gameplay is okay
-No 3D only games, a mix of 2D and 3D is okay
-No games that require premission to manage phone calls or anything weird and unusal like that
-No games without auto/skip mode

Thanks!"

depression,f5rzezw,t3_donuan,1572406860.0,"I hate waking up, and then just..being forced to live. 

All I do is sleep these days.. I don't enjoy anything anymore.. I don't like reading, watching movies, playing games, being with my dog..

I have no friends, and I never really had them.
I fear talking online, even..

Everything is meaningless..

And then my psychiatrist goes and tells me: ""Oh you don't have depression.""

Cool thanks so am I faking it all??"
