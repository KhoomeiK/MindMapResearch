The fact that she's been in an iffy situation is kind of concerning in the sense that when it ends (hopefully soon) she needs time to recover from that herself. Not that you shouldn't help, being there could build your potential future relationship. Rushing into it could really bring problems."

Anything that's a sliver of a responsibility, like work and school, is just too much to bear and you're pushing forward because you must for the people you love to not ruin their lives.

Psychiatrists in the US fucking suck. I got therapy when I lived out of the country and they don't shove pills down your throat like they do here. I have to contest changing dosages every session. That being said my therapist is otherwise good.

So what would I suggest? Getting in a like-minded community online. The support of those who understand eachother is crucial and the world is vast so you're bound to meet many who suffer as you do. Try seeking out other subreddits and finding people or Facebook groups or something of the like. You'll see that there's a way to overcome from real people who feel/felt like you do.

I say this not to criticize your fears but rather ease your mind. 

Now onto the other elements, I completely understand you worrying about your mental health preventing you from opening up and letting someone in. Unfortunately I too am very mentally unwell and have been abandoned/hurt by partners for it. It's just a risk/reward analysis. If you're willing to feel the wonder that is love then you have to risk that failure. Plus, you're already at a sure-fire chance of failing if you don't try. However, if you find the risk too great and it would set you back that badly then maybe you're better without it. Moreover it wouldn't be fair to the other person if you don't fully trust them due to your fears, right? 

You're living your life for you, not your parents. Nice to consider their desires but at the day's end you gotta do what's best for you. I am a ""let's give it a shot"" kind of person."
