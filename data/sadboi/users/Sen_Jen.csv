It results in the Canadian player sitting around and slowly building factories for ages until the war starts, and by then they wont be powerful enough to prevent France from capitulating. Once that happens, you can fight on the minor fronts like Africa and South East Asia, but you can't contribute to the war in a major way until D-Day.

I'm too afraid to tell many people near to me when I'm struggling because if I'm seen as weak, I could be made fun of, bullied or abandoned. 



Imo the biggest failing of today's feminism (and I say this as a feminist) is that people aren't clear about getting their message about men and masculinity Vs toxic masculinity. To a lot of feminists it's assumed that people understand what toxic masculinity is, and the difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity. Being masculine is something that should be celebrated, but there should be no pressure to be masculine. When men are pressured to stay strong, and not say when they're hurting, it's because they feel pressured to be masculine - and that's what toxic masculinity is."
