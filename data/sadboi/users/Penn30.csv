band,fc70m5l,t3_egimac,1577494356.0,"I’m not trying to change your opinion I would just like to state my view.

 Marching band is more on par with sprinting and running while having the attentiveness to survey your surroundings while you perform(you can’t expect to do a show without being super focused and aware of your surroundings). For about 10 minutes you have to “march” a certain way with proper technique without seeing directly where you’re going at very fast paces all the while blowing your entire air supply into an instrument that already requires a lot of focus and whole other skill set. There’s also around 100-150 other people doing the same thing that depend on you to hit your dot at exactly the right moment so you don’t collide and get a concussion or a broken arm. 

The mental and physical dedication required puts it on par with being a regular sport like football. A good performance can also be seen as a win in that sense. In the end a win just means you’re the best out of everyone, good enough to beat them at least. So striving to win is the same as striving to be the best which is what everyone wants when they perform. 

That’s just my two cents as someone who’s done marching band and also has experience with sports(volleyball, soccer and gymnastics)
You are of course entitled to your opinion and I in no way have any desire to try to change it"

They are full grown adults and their behavior is just disgusting. They are gaslighting you and trying to manipulate you once again. You’re parents are 100% abusive jerks. I’m going through the same thing as you, minus the physical abuse, and I know what it’s like questioning everything, trying to fault yourself because you feel obligated to love your family.

They’re older than me so they understand everything I’m going through. Your friend is right, you act this way because it’s the way you’ve been taught. Maybe not on purpose but your mom behaving that way as you grew up taught you to be like that. It’s a struggle trying to overcome that. Try to remember that your siblings are going through what you’re doing. You can still help them and show them what real love is, not that toxic bs your mom is giving y’all. You can help each other, don’t be like my siblings, I know they care but they ended up doing nothing after they left. And last of all, it’s it 100% not your fault your mom gets angry, she has problems and she’s taking it out on her kids, that’s a big no no.

I didn’t realize I had started till I went to the restroom. Make sure you have some pain medicine for the cramps. Warm showers and heat help with cramps also. Drink a lot of water and be prepared for period diarrhea. You’re going to go through pads quickly and that’s ok. If you’re going to use tampons don’t leave them in for long. You don’t have to stick to one pad per day. You really shouldn’t. Buy some overnight pads also. Remember gravity determines the direction of flow. Download a period tracking app. It’s better than having to write down and keep paper logs. Your period is going to be irregular at first. Some months you might even skip it. That’s completely normal. Your cycle will become more routinely as you get older. If someone gives you shit about your period you tell them ‘I started my day in a pool of my own blood. Is that how you would like to end yours?’ then walk away like a queen. Hydrogen peroxide and water for stains. Wet your affected clothes, pour some peroxide over the stain, watch it bubble, some asmr if you’re into that. Then take a cotton ball, pour peroxide on it, don’t have to douse it and dab the stain till it starts to fade, it’ll look brownish. Rinse it in cold water and repeat until its almost gone, if you have time then put it in the washer, if not hang to dry and wash when you have time for laundry. The stain should be nearly invisible and hard to see if you do this."
