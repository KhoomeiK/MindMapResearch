vandwellers,fcxwuxx,t1_fcxugby,1578071666.0,I managed to find a starter but it wasn't very good quality and it broke again the next week. it's difficult to find parts for. I'll be looking into getting other parts reconditioned *if* they break too.
IDmydog,fcw1tij,t1_fcw1b4t,1578015183.0,I was thinking that too! Thanks :)

vandwellers,fadv5wz,t3_e89ky4,1575987159.0,Cute van!!
aww,fadqova,t1_fadqlki,1575983417.0,"Oh there's no denying him, way too cute. At my grandad's I got told off for ""rolling"" the ball inside for him.. so he led me to the garden hahah. Clever pupper"
vandwellers,f8pqj06,t1_f8ofydd,1574705710.0,"I love the Renault it's really fun to drive I'm so glad I went for it. I really wanted to try push it down the hill but everyone told me that was a bad idea for some reason haha. I'm not handy enough to know how to fix mechanical things, so I'm waiting on my mechanic.

I'm a student at the moment so quite flexible but I do end up being back in the city most week days. Can't wait for the summer months!!"
vandwellers,f8ofk5b,t1_f8oewoe,1574678296.0,"It's not been much luck since I got it hahah. There's been a few things but at the moment my new starter motor is faulty and broke after 2 days of it being fitted. Honestly all week I've wanted to go and push it so I could leave the city XD. 

I'm staying with my family as my mechanic is close to their house and I'm lucky to have a great mum who understands living on the road so she's happy keep a bed spare for me incase things like this happen :)"
vandwellers,f8ocngv,t1_f8nplrz,1574673586.0,"Yes, although it's broken down this week so I'm trying to sort other things to keep myself occupied as I'm bored without van life"
leaves,f7pwbfu,t1_f7pvog0,1573955374.0,I'm glad :)
leaves,f6wkui2,t1_f6wkcj7,1573228898.0,Completely understand where you're coming from. Some people just think weed is a cure all and non addictive. It is naive. And sad.
leaves,f6w1g9b,t1_f6vxv9w,1573212316.0,"It amplified my anxiety so much too. I was unable to go into the kitchen out of fear of conversation unless I was high. In actual fact it was the weed making me feel nervous and unable to chat. I've been a completely different person socially since I quit. 
Keep going, you can do this :)"
leaves,f6w17q5,t1_f6vuds0,1573211978.0,"Fuck that negative voice! I would always zone out when talking to people too and just auto pilot responses, not at all engaged.
You can do it, I believe in you!!"
leaves,f6w11eh,t1_f6vm1c5,1573211726.0,Great one. It gets to that point where weed isn't even enjoyable anymore.
leaves,f6w0yas,t1_f6vjqrt,1573211598.0,"I'm glad I made this post as people are capturing things really well. Some of these reasons I had forgot about so when it hits me and takes me back to that place I used to be in I forget about my craving for weed. I definitely hated that ""groundhog day effect""

Please don't give up!! The longer you go the better it feels."
leaves,f6vbk47,t1_f6v9d4f,1573181655.0,"Thank you. I know I can't let myself buy any because every time I resist the urge the pathway I'm creating in my brain gets stronger. I won't allow myself to smoke for unhealthy reasons, I'll deffo want more if I do it once. Music is my only current de-stresser, you're right I need to find more ways to cope."
AskReddit,ewio2m2,t3_co0xmf,1565453357.0,"Yes it did end once my mother finally gave up on him and kicked him out. She was incredibly brave and stopped letting him take advantage of her by using her to get alcohol money even after they were divorced. There was a big ordeal with police and social services involved and it was complicated trying to make him leave our lives but it had to be done so we could live ours happily. We moved cities in the end for a fresh start. 

I no longer talk to my dad who is an alcoholic and drug user. I don't miss him because of the pain he caused my mum and siblings. I miss the times we had when he wasn't an alcoholic but I was very young then and the bad outweighs the good unfortunately. He has my phone number but never calls. Sometimes I feel sorry for him but then I remember he had multiple chances to change but never bothered. He did teach me one thing in life and that's to not waste it like he did so at least I can learn from his mistakes and remember to always try to stay motivated and be the best person I can be. 

I wish you the best. You can send me a message if you ever need someone to chat to :)"

PMDD,euox6ip,t1_euou5k2,1563948224.0,"I was taking CBD oil 8.1mg by Holistic Herb I live in the UK and we only have a couple of brands here that are sold in Holland and Barrett. I tried a less potent oil for a few months and it did nothing for me and it tasted bad. Then I bought a double strength oil which was a more expensive brand I think had some kind of favouring in it because it didn't taste so bad. It said to use 3 drops 3 times per day but I definitely took more than that (I'm not suggesting you do that). Start with a small dosage and test what works for your body. I know that capsules are also sold here and I might try that next time. Honestly it's just like taking any other food supplement, I didn't notice any changes until I got to my period one month and was like ""wait a minute.. I didn't have a bad week!!"""
PMDD,euohea7,t3_ch36p9,1563941762.0,"I started taking CBD for anxiety and then I noticed my PMDD symptoms getting better month by month. It took a little while to work properly and i was very generous with my doses. I stopped taking it because I ran out this month and my PMDD came straight back so yes, for me it does work along with other supplements."
confidence,eu2skb2,t3_cefsa8,1563397166.0,"Maybe try small steps at first? Wear what you like on a walk around the block or something and build up to busier places. If you want to feel more comfortable wearing new things in front of people who already know you then you could upload a new profile picture of you in the new clothes first and when people see you in person they have already seen you in a different way so they probably won't really care. 

I used to be the same until I joined a fine art degree where everyone dresses wacky as hell so I just learned from them to embrace who I am and my personal style, just like they are. People mostly are too busy thinking about themselves to remember what others have been wearing and if they do pay you a bit more attention then it's probably because you look good!!"

aspergirls,esd3q65,t3_c72huu,1561846285.0,I wear a couple of rings so I usually hold my hands together and twist / wiggle them up and down my fingers when I need to :) it's pretty subtle.
Anxiety,es6akdi,t3_c62lpt,1561644792.0,"Well done to you for taking that first step! 

I'm on a waiting list for therapy, my initial appointment was in April and i can't be seen until November. The limited resource are frustrating but they contacted me offering online self help resources for the mean time. I was told that the waiting lists using go down faster than expected as some people cancel so hang in there!!"
Anxiety,eqri1kg,t3_bzbml5,1560261486.0,I did this too much without realising it. And then it feels impossible to ever get yourself out of the situation because you just feel too bad.
