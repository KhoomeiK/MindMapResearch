NoFap,fqhrue1,t3_ggyexl,1589383166.0,You said the same thing twice. It will change your life by setting off a positive domino effect. Just cuz it didn't work for you doesn't mean it won't work for anyone else.

NoFap,fq76z3k,t3_gh2au0,1589142589.0,Awesome I'm glad. I'm sure you feel many benefits with 120 also to though right?
NoFap,fq767t7,t1_fq5k6ml,1589142317.0,Yeah for me it was way more than 5 seconds
NoFap,fq75i94,t1_fq5i3rp,1589142055.0,It's a good suggestion. I still jump here when I feel like relapsing and probably will forever. It's smarter and easier than trying to battle it alone.

Anyway I'm going to make it to 90 days to make a preliminary judgement"
NoFap,fp8lgdi,t3_gbx0f0,1588395469.0,I'm going to make it to 90. I had to keep telling myself that a minute ago I came so close to relapse so far it has been a journey but this last 15 minutes was probably the closest I've ever come. I am a couple ways days away from 60 and I'll be damned if I don't make it to 90. I'm a mo once a week after I hit 90 days but this month will show me how it feels to get to 90 days. I will stay strong
NoFap,fop2qj9,t1_foopgt6,1587951786.0,I like to check it once a day as it serves as good reinforcement and provides support when seeing other people going through the same journey
NoFap,foomxqn,t1_fooly0o,1587942199.0,Like today I'm going to eat only raw foods for a week as an experiment to see how I feel. If all goes well I'll keep going
NoFap,fooly0o,t1_fook8nu,1587941625.0,A lot of things. One thing is keeping yourself motivated. Look up the benefits get pumped up envision what life would be like and how much better it will be. Hey the benefits may be real may be fake but how will you know if you never try
NoFap,foog4hj,t1_food904,1587938341.0,Well that is a question that need to be answered by you to tailor suit what you want it off this. For me I started MOing once a week for about a month then I switched to hard mode to see what all the fuss is about. I'm currently working to hit 90 days. There are a lot of things I'm working on accomplishing so I'm using this as a tool to boost my motivation and give me energy. Those are my reasons but you gotta find yours
NoFap,fonhmt6,t3_g8dus4,1587919665.0,Good job making it back here so quickly. I would say that it shouldn't make you feel guilty in the act itself. The only feelings of guilt is only in failing what you say out to do

NoFap,fojr1ky,t3_g7rvnc,1587827565.0,I believe I never would have started if I wasn't pressured into doing it. It seemed as though everyone was doing it. Initially it didn't seem attractive. Still it doesn't to me I never got into hardcore seens where women were degraded. I mostly engaged in pov role playing scenes but I doubt I would have been so motivated to achieve an orgasm through porn if it wasn't for me feeling different than my peers
NoFap,fo3q6rp,t3_g5gy7r,1587491143.0,I know you are trying to reach a goal but try not to be so hard on yourself. You had a minor slip and I fall into the same trap as in putting so much emphasis into the number of days when that is less relevant too actually changing your lifestyle. Take pride in your accomplishment and move on. Focus on what you can change.
NoFap,fo3ppd5,t1_fo3fuqb,1587490911.0,I wonder why some people have this mentality and others such as myself feel as though they are lacking if they aren't with anyone

NoFap,fmxdadp,t3_essxpe,1586462843.0,"Yes I can relate and I still never watched vanilla porn but have had vanilla sex, not many times but yes normal relationships just not porn. I think I've always had a submissive fetish that being said it is mostly fantasy and would hate if some of it happened in real life rather than just fantasy"
NoFap,fmxb8p4,t1_fml88kw,1586461806.0,That is my go to if I were to ever get back into faping again. It has some kind of release from responsibility or something that is freeing
NoFap,fmxb3dr,t1_fminun1,1586461730.0,Like? Pm me
NoFap,fmxasna,t1_fmxamip,1586461576.0,I just realized that it isn't the fetish in particular that is bad only the urges because porn is the only outlet to experience them. I'll just stay strong and make it to 90 at least
NoFap,fmxaisd,t1_fhw13sa,1586461435.0,Same fetish and yes I don't think there's anything wrong with it as long as it doesn't interfere. My problem is the urges I have bc porn is the only outlet for experiencing this
NoFap,fmxa6c0,t1_fhwcv56,1586461257.0,Any recovery stories?
NoFap,fmx9w6x,t1_fmvxpwm,1586461109.0,Sometimes I feel like I will never recover from those fantasies and my sex life will never be normal again

NoFap,fml5ewp,t1_fmkgd2w,1586179048.0,Thanks. Yes I am just getting into eating healthy and mostly vegan maybe consuming meat or fish every 3 days. It is possible that it caused it if not the buildup for a month. But yes I've heard this before
NoFap,fmivbz7,t1_fmi4ojs,1586117664.0,I usually only have one a month and although I rather not have to deal with feeling sluggish there's not much I can do about it. If love to hear your technique though
NoFap,fmitksi,t3_fr83k4,1586116640.0,I had one last night that's why I am commenting I don't remember I just woke up. All in my head I do feel sluggish but I don't think about it I'm fine no biggie
NoFap,fmhxpxi,t3_fr83k4,1586097016.0,WD is ejaculation but not a relapse. How could something involuntary be considered a relapse. If you are trying to attain 90 days you WILL have a WD
NoFap,fmfr5wb,t1_fmfqy28,1586033133.0,I sleep a lot because there's nothing to do

So far I have seen some great changes I have quit cigarettes and have begun eating healthy or working out everyday meditating and living in all together better life. My goal is to at least make 90 days but to make it a lifestyle so that I can have a life of my dreams.

NoFap,flqvyxn,t3_fq5p9m,1585407492.0,How about using them to find a girlfriend which by the way has never worked for me and has only led to lower self-esteem and depressed thinking because of it. But what about if it does legit help to find a girlfriend I've heard of it working in the past.
NoFap,flqv3qb,t3_fqkdus,1585406916.0,I caved in after the same situation but I wish I would've stuck with it because it wasn't worth the relapse and maybe I quit right before the miracle happened. I failed to realize the abundant sea of women out there.

I know many of you are going to say something against this but I would just like positive logical feedback thanks."

NoFap,flhgtcq,t3_fbnkyl,1585162370.0,I am 21 days into my journey of recovery and I feel great! I feel a lot stronger and more proud of myself for being able to accomplish this as well as quitting cigarettes which today is day two. Slowly but surely I want to get rid of every single thing that is holding me back in my life as well as practice better habits. It has motivated me to discipline myself and do what I know is right and I do have a set of habits that make me more disciplined and more positive on a daily basis. I try not to watch TV all day which is kind of hard with the virus going around I tried to get some things done even though I don't have a job and I make meetings as I am in recovery as well with 63 days clean! Encourage everyone out there to try this journey as it is well worth the effort. Stay strong and be the best you you can be!

NoFap,fklvqv9,t1_fklv4bd,1584315660.0,I guess just the illusion that it is of some benefit and special since I put so much work into it.

I finally have my cellphone back but I saw plenty of pictures and videos I have stashed and I got a flashback about my new life. I quickly deleted the pics and a craving to look at more crossed my mind but I came here instead. Life in recovery is so much better and just for today I will not sacrifice it. Just for March I will not fall.
