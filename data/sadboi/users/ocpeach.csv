depression,fd77cql,t3_ek8a13,1578200383.0,"1. I love you. Yes— I don’t know you, but I love you.
That might not mean much, but it’s true. I wish you didn’t have this pain and turmoil and I just wish I could scoop you up and let you just cry cause that’s what I need right now too. 
2. I hear you, I see you, and I want you to know your feelings are valid.
3. I haven’t “cured” myself from this depressive episode but I do feel more hopeful than I did before and that’s because I am working at utilizing all methods to work and improve myself. 
One book I read was the positive advantage, and it was really great, though I need to read again and take notes because it really is amazing how perspective changes everything. Depression makes us perceive everything as dark — black and white — pain and suffering or nothing. However, I know that there are glasses out there that help people see color — medication, therapy, self help, meditation etc. Well, I have a couple pairs of those glasses and I have seen a glimpse of the hopeful beauty out there, but I’m not done yet, I still have to learn what all the colors I’m seeing are.

So my whole metaphor shpiel is to tell you, it’s not going to be easy now, but if you’re willing to hold on to even a glimmer of motivation and hope, slowly you will start to see the colors back in your life (I hope).

It’s cliche and it sucks, but you HAVE to start with small goals. What helped me is I got a daily planner. It’s broken down hourly and when I was at my LOWEST low, I would literally make goals like “put makeup on and make the bed” simple things that depression makes harder. So maybe for you it’s just “text a friend”.
Texting a friend doesn’t have to jump right too, force myself to get coffee with friend... give yourself grace. 

Slowly the more you feel better, positivity and people gravitate towards that because you yourself attract it."

I’m really scared since I have family in Iran (good people, not for the regime) and I’m terrified I’ll never see them again and even if they are safe, I don’t see how they would be able to come to the US anytime soon. I have many friends that are active duty military too and I’m really scared of losing them as many are combat. It feels different when it’s not a place you are “connected” to but America is everything to me but I do have family in Iran. My mom tells me not to worry but my anxiety is already so bad and the thought of a World War is fucking shaking me and I was a history major so I know how bad it gets 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Like I was so young during the beginning of the last one and my boyfriend was actually in combat in Afghanistan but I didn’t know him until after so I never felt like truly scared and was kind of far removed.

I’m literally crying and no one is taking it seriously. My military friends are joking and of course they signed up for it and are ready but people making jokes about killing Iranians is scaring me. The Iranian people don’t want this!!!! I’m sorry for the long comment I’m just legit scared too and I’m crying right now and my boyfriend isn’t taking is seriously and my parents and everyone says I’m over dramatic, I mean they aren’t worried about their family? And Iran has mandatory military service and a majority HATE the Islamic Republic but are going to be forced to fight and die for these disgusting leaders. Lastly, I’m being selfish, but I don’t want people in the US to start hating me and bullying me again. My whole life I have to try to laugh off jokes about me being a terrorist and I sadly had to learn that at age 7.

I moved away from my family for the year and I’m so homesick and feel uncomfortable since this place doesn’t yet feel like I belong or comfortable. 

I am currently on my first visit since moving away 3 months ago and I was lucky to be able to take a long visit (2 1/2) weeks which is what I thought I needed, but it turns out, as much as I miss home, being here for so long is making my mind feel just as you described “in limbo” I feel like even though this is “home” I still have another place I need to be and then when I’m back in the other state, all I think about is going home to visit. I think at least for me, I need to not take such frequent and long trips home because while it seemed like the solution, I was actually able to function better when I was in the other state missing home and looking forward to visiting .

Anxiety,f30be2a,t3_dcujau,1570550651.0,"[Long reply ahead because I wish I found more responses like mine when I feel down]

Hi friend, your post really resonated with me even though I’m not in college, I’m feeling the exact way as you. I knew I would be homesick, I had NO idea it would be so painful (it’s similar to grief). I take to reddit a lot to see if others are feeling like me so I really want to be here and let you know I feel you so deeply on this.

I recently moved away from the people I love most so that my boyfriend and I could experience living in another place (always knew I could come back) but I have been experiencing the same anxiety like you which then leads to depression and have had to take additional meds and get therapy. You and I just feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar and so our anxiety wants to revert back to when things “seemed” greater.

I haven’t come out the other side, because like you I just keep counting down the days for this to be over with, but I can tell you that you are not alone in your feelings. I can’t wait to look back and say, at least I did it, because I really wanted to make the move and would have regretted it more than regretting moving. It can seem as if everyone around you is handling being away just fine, but I remember that they aren’t me, and the way I feel isn’t wrong or invalid and I try to baby myself a bit because fighting my feelings and trying to be like others makes it worse. Everyone says it’s temporary and I believe that, but it’s still of course very hard and I’m visiting home right now but made the mistake of staying too long and now I don’t feel home here nor in my new place. Going home might not cure you, but it gives you something to look forward to, so I’m glad you’re going home, even if you aren’t cured, being around your loves is way better.

Now, in college, I had the same feeling even though I lived 65 miles away and HATED my first year because I had the worst roommates and wanted to give up, but then the next year I got out of that situation and enjoyed myself a lot more, but I only had two years in University since I transferred from a CC.
Hopefully meds and counseling will give you a bit more ability to stick this out for a bit longer before making a decision? Of course, you need to do what’s best for you and if after time your anxiety and depression doesn’t subside, then do what you need to do!

Please message me whenever, I can’t even tell you how much of your experience I feel!! Love and hugs."

I have been going through a very tough period of anxiety and depression and I really had to come to terms that I need a two front approach 1. Medication and 2. Therapy
