india,fnt6tyv,t3_g3mehq,1587235736.0,"Fair enough. 

But for me, as someone earlier stated in this thread, education is the most important factor to reduce the effect of religion. And I am not talking about mere reading, writing, and eventually sending kids to do engineering. I am talking about an education system which encourages students to be more inquisitive. 
Students should always be taught to ask questions and I cannot emphasize this point enough. Through this, students will develop a tendency to critically examine the things they are taught. They will cross check the news they see and ask for concrete proofs for what their parents, teachers, leaders tell them. Eventually, they will realize that theocracy can never provide them such proofs and the arguments it can present is either ambiguous or straight up fictional in nature. Every jumla will be nibbed off before it can reach the masses.

This is terrible, unacceptable, and beyond the comprehension of anyone who envisions India as a superpower. There is violence from both the sides, I agree. But can we just take a step back and think why this feeling of hatred is driving the people in the first place? Why do pro-CAA people villanize the anti-CAA ones and vice-versa? We have to acknowledge the fact that in a country like ours, different opinions are bound to exist.

Instead of having a dialogue with the protesters, the central government chooses to stay mute and try to suppress dissent. If the authorized suppression wasn't enough, their spokesperson comes up and incites further violence through his irrational and lunatic hate-speeches. Galvanizing people in the name of religion - is that how we are operating in 2020?

Is that how a democracy works?

If 51% of voted for the ruling party then it doesn't mean that the remainder 49% will have their voices shut.

I know this comment will get mass down voted. Go ahead and do it. But there's one thing that no one can disagree upon - that is the sheer incompetency of this government to preserve peace and unity of this country. They are ripping apart the social fabric of this country into two-pieces for their own unrealistic agendas and we are quietly letting that happen. You say those at JNU are the ""Tukde-Tukde Gang""? Well you ain't exactly putting adhesive to the cause, are you?

Peaceful dialogue is only practical way to contain the massacre that has unfolded in Delhi. But do the people at the center have the balls to engage in one?

When Modi came to power in 2014. I supported him. I actually believed that he'd steer India towards prosperity. In 2020, we would be an exporting economy with non-existent unemployment. No farmer will commit suicide. The growth rate of economy would surpass that of mid-2000s level. I really hoped that this man would unite us all towards a collective goal of making India a modern manufacturing global superpower.

These branches have quite a overlap with CSE curriculum and you can sit for CS companies or pursue an MS in CS without any hassle.
Don't compromise your college a lot with such a good rank.

Both DTU and NSIT are a mere shadow of their pasts, thanks to 85% Delhi home state reservation and poor management. They just have an advantage of their alumni network and location."

CasualConversation,epw7bhi,t3_bvzgc9,1559568074.0,"Initially there was resistance, then followed the acceptance.

I used to be someone with many friends and I hung out with multiple groups. All that gave me a sense of validation but at the expense of my own well being. I'm not much of a social person and dealing with people gives me all sorts of anxiety and panic moments. 

Eventually, I realised that just to feed my insecurity of remaining a loner, I was trying too hard to fit myself in places I didn't belong to. 

I still have friends. Very close and very less in number I would say. But I'm happy now. I hangout by myself in the college and eat lunch alone listening to my favorite music with earphones on. It's a peaceful life. Acceptance has really worked out for me.

Just try to be yourself okay. Go have an amazing dinner by yourself, you deserve it. Invite your mom over if it's possible. Seems like she must be an interesting person to hangout with :)"
