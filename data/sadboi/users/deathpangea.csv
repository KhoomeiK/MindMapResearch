cripplingalcoholism,fq61yhl,t1_fq5qr2f,1589122797.0,Right. I’m just looking for someone here who has similar symptoms. Even my neurologist was baffled said it could possibly be MS. Neuropathy doesn’t come and go. I don’t really have symptoms at all until I’m hot
Hypothyroidism,fq4pbb1,t1_fq4oe9l,1589081047.0,It’s all over my body. I wouldn’t say freaked out. I just want to know what’s causing it.
cripplingalcoholism,fq3x9js,t1_fq3t52h,1589071338.0,Painful how? Like pins and needles? Did sweating sort of relieve it?

dryalcoholics,fq1dhi8,t1_fq1d3w0,1589044659.0,And it would go away once you sweat? Any numbness with it?
Hypothyroidism,fq1d6ts,t1_fq1cbpf,1589044576.0,Honest pretty concerned it’s MS. Got my lab results last week and all of my vitamins are in check. I’ve never heard of neuropathy presenting itself this way
dryalcoholics,fq1akj7,t1_fq19it6,1589043836.0,"Interesting, I unfortunately do get it in the shower. Do you get all over your body (torso, face, arms, etc.)?

Just looking for answers anywhere at this point honestly"

dryalcoholics,fq17won,t1_fq13rzf,1589042984.0,Mine isn’t pre diabetes. I’m desperate and looking for folks who really have the same symptoms because I can’t make sense of it. Did yours improve when you start to sweat or exercise? Does it only get really bad in the heat?
cripplingalcoholism,fq0plt7,t1_fpzvcvr,1589035619.0,This has been going on far too long to be dehydration
cripplingalcoholism,fpzd41f,t1_fpz8px6,1589016738.0,I would be thrilled if they told me I had some sort of neuropathy but I’ve never heard of alcohol neuropathy presenting itself this way. I need to get an MRI when this coronavirus stuff is over
cripplingalcoholism,fpz7le0,t1_fpz774a,1589014656.0,Eh yeah was afraid of the MS thing because that’s what I was thinking too. I guess it’s better that than space aids
Hypothyroidism,fpz7ecr,t1_fpz6kg6,1589014583.0,"Yep, that’s how it is for me. I sometimes not experience it at all and the next day it’ll be back with a vengeance. I don’t get hives or a rash but I’ve been told it could be CU"

Hypothyroidism,fpy91qj,t1_fpy8ws9,1588998739.0,You have the same symptoms?
Erythromelalgia,fpwsw39,t1_fpwrofe,1588969368.0,"Yeah, I’ve taken action. The only thing l haven’t gotten done is an MRI. This was a long shot to see if anyone here had similar symptoms but it doesn’t look like it. My symptoms go away after sweating and I don’t get any swelling or burning"
Erythromelalgia,fpwr2qz,t1_fpwqecp,1588968415.0,"No, I don’t get hives or any rashes. I do get redness however. I feel like I’m being poked all over my body (torso, face, arms, hands, legs, feet). After I start to sweat it dissipates. I’ll still feel it after sweating but it’s not nearly as intense. Some people believe it’s r/cholinergicurticaria but I experience no hives or rashes. Multiple sclerosis would make more sense to me but I honestly have no clue. I would think after a couple years my symptoms would have progressed but they’re pretty much the same."
Erythromelalgia,fpwpxsw,t1_fpwohs0,1588967827.0,Yes but only blood tests and every checked out fine
Erythromelalgia,fpwp2jx,t1_fpwoeuo,1588967378.0,Interesting. It’s more of a poking sensation rather than an itching sensation. Do you think it’s related to erythromelagia
neuropathy,fpwj0vn,t1_fpw6y9i,1588964307.0,I have no clue. I watched your first video on YouTube where you were concerned about MS. We don’t really have any symptoms in common but I wish you luck man.
neuropathy,fpth1qd,t1_fptgd76,1588891105.0,Based on my symptoms a lot of people believe it’s r/cholinergicurticaria but I have no hives/rashes so it’s still a mystery.
neuropathy,fpsthv1,t1_fpsrh91,1588879355.0,Yeah I’m pretty concerned I have MS because my symptoms are exacerbated by heat. I actually don’t even really have symptoms until I’m exposed to heat. I still haven’t gotten an MRI but hopefully soon
neuropathy,fpsl9ou,t1_fpns6dl,1588875376.0,As far as I know neuropathy can’t come and go. Most people in this sub would agree but there are exceptions. My neurologist even told me symptoms can’t come and go with neuropathy
neuropathy,fpou28y,t1_fpot6sv,1588790666.0,"Hm, even my neurologist said that’s not possible. Interesting. Do you symptoms go away for the rest of the day after sweating?"

dysautonomia,fo3uaex,t1_fo3szxi,1587493061.0,Interesting. So is this more likely to be mast cell/dysautonomia rather than CU since I have no rash? Or could it be both?
dysautonomia,fo217jh,t1_fo18nb5,1587446689.0,I forgot to add that while exercising after  I begin to sweat I will begin to get some relief. But I never see any rashes or hives. I’ve been experiencing this for a couple years now so I have no idea what’s going on. It does feel more internal rather than a skin condition but I honestly have no clue
dysautonomia,fo167x0,t1_fo141h8,1587426579.0,Do you have cholinergic urticaria?
dysautonomia,fo0xe2s,t1_fo0vqxz,1587421571.0,I originally thought this but I don’t get hives or any kind of rash
cripplingalcoholism,fne8z6i,t3_g182dw,1586885150.0,"Eh, I think you might be surprised by how much the “average” person drinks. A lot of folks consider themselves to not drink a lot but will kill a 6 pack every night. That’s not a crippling alcoholic but they certainly have a problem. And on the other hand there’s people who drink a 6 pack a night who think they’re crippling alcoholics."
COVID19positive,fncy5fd,t1_fncxzdq,1586851343.0,Yeah that’s true. But if 96% of cases are mild then why are we reacting to this as if it’s the plague?
COVID19positive,fncu7ln,t1_fnctq51,1586847360.0,This is so strange to me. If 96% of cases are mild then why does it seem like every other person is getting extremely ill?
AskDoctorSmeeee,fnbn9m0,t3_g0q17j,1586818574.0,I think this is pretty common. I can do this too and it’s even more prominent if I scratch myself while in the heat or sweating
neuropathy,fnb6my2,t1_fnb3ou4,1586810136.0,"In my opinion there’s still no real answers. I’ve landed on the possibilities of multiple sclerosis (unlikely) and some kind of unique form of neuropathy. I also stumbled upon cholinergic urticaria. Cholinergic urticaria really lines up with my symptoms. However, I don’t get a rash and my pricking stabbing sensation feels more internal"

neuropathy,fn7kvpu,t1_fn7k8fc,1586722359.0,The neurologist I saw treats patients with neuropathy and he confidently said it was not neuropathy. I guess I’ll try to find another neurologist but I have a feeling they’re going to give me a similar answer.
neuropathy,fn7j81t,t1_fn7cnb0,1586721414.0,"I can’t find anything where neuropathy only effects people in the heat. Also, I’ve asked the question a few times on this subreddit and everyone seems to agree it’s not neuropathy. Does your neuropathy still get worse in the heat or is it constant now?"
neuropathy,fn7e2ho,t1_fn78wjv,1586718494.0,According to another person in this thread it could just be neuropathy. I’ve never heard of neuropathy only effecting someone in the heat but they claim that’s how it started for them. Who knows
neuropathy,fn7br93,t1_fn7b9en,1586717202.0,So if I have a normal EMG and my skin biopsy comes back normal could I still have neuropathy?

neuropathy,fn7a1co,t1_fn77w1k,1586716225.0,I’ve seen a neurologist. After describing my symptoms he seemed to think it could possibly be the beginning stages of MS. He said it wasn’t neuropathy because I only experience symptoms in heat. I guess he could be wrong
neuropathy,fn77mfh,t1_fn77f5i,1586714863.0,Interesting well that gives me hope considering I thought it could be MS. It’s been this way for two years.
neuropathy,fn77alm,t1_fn75tv1,1586714677.0,I’ve had this for a couple years now. My neurologist said MS is a possibility but I can’t afford an MRI at the moment. I also would suggest searching cholinergic urticaria. I’m not sure if that’s what it is but it definitely sounds like something similar. I’m really sorry you’re going through this and I hope we find answers soon. You’ll find similar posts from people going through the same thing but no one really has a good explanation for it. I really thought it could be MS but I don’t really have any other symptoms.
neuropathy,fn76sge,t1_fn6nc51,1586714397.0,"Isn’t nerve damage more of a constant or consistent sensation of numbness or pins and needles? I only get a stabbing prickly sensation during exercise, hot shower, in the sun, or when I’m exposed to heat in any way"

neuropathy,fmbvsvx,t3_fu1y2q,1585934137.0,Ah man do I feel for you. I’ve had this for around 3 years and no doctor or neurologist has been able to give me a real answer. My neurologist thinks it could be multiple sclerosis but I can’t afford an MRI right now. It’s definitely not typical neuropathy because it goes away for hours but is exacerbated by heat almost always. If I exercise it’ll get really intense and I’ll get the prickly sensation all over until I begin to sweat. When I start to sweat it seems to relieve it a bit. I’ve looked into cholinergic urticaria but it feels more neurological than it does a skin condition. If you browse the internet you’ll find similar posts but it’s pretty uncommon.
