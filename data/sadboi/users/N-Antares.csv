AskDID,fjx30wa,t3_ff9ezo,1583654397.0,"From my understanding (disclaimer: I am *not* an expert), you do need to have some trauma and/or disorganised attachment patterns before the ages of 7–9 to develop DID. However, it is super common for those with this disorder not to remember the early trauma. The only trauma I remember is from when I was 11 onwards, but after I started therapy I have discovered (and 'know enough' without having the actual memory) that there was earlier trauma and my attachment to primary caregivers when I was younger was not at all ideal. So I'd say that it is possible you could have the disorder and not have memory of what initially caused it, but you'll need to go to an expert to find out for sure. Either way, I recommend finding a therapist if you can. Whether you have DID or not, it sounds like the dissociation is affecting your life and you could benefit from professional help."

OSDD,fiqw9qw,t1_fiqr3q9,1582652793.0,"I had that too! Your posts often resonate with me, which is nice given how this disorder manifests itself in such vastly different ways in different people (understandably, since everyone's trauma/cause is different).

I reached pretty much the same conclusion re gradually building trust between me and the other parts so that we can work through the trauma together rather than one fully fronting to work through it on their own. It's a limitation of our always co-con situation, but I think it's also a blessing in disguise: if an alter is able to work through their trauma on their own, they might feel no need to work together with the system. In our case(s), healing trauma becomes an incentive for building strong relationships and trust between the parts, which is integral for improved overall functioning and healing."
OSDD,fiqlpx3,t1_fiqblp4,1582646996.0,"I do understand this want to feel valid. Similar to TrustedSibs, I've only felt as though another part was more forward than me once or twice. And yes, I felt more valid after that. However, the doubts return. They always do and they probably always do, and from what I've read on here and elsewhere, that doesn't change whether you have full switches or not: doubt and feeling invalid is just part of the disorder, no matter how obvious the switches are.

It is healthier to not be able to fully switch: it means the barriers between the parts are less defined, which is a goal in healing. So I don't think we should seriously be trying to encourage full switching."
OSDD,fiqktrz,t1_fiqa5zy,1582646446.0,"Feeling tired and needing a break is totally understandable, but choosing to switch fully in order to avoid that feeling is like an alcoholic choosing to down bottles of vodka to escape their feelings. It is understandable when it happens, but I would never advise it or encourage it. If you're currently unable of switching fully, that is actually healthier for you, even if it doesn't feel like it. Being able to feel shitty is actually healthier than being able to dissociate it away. 

That's why the therapy plan for dissociative disorders is so hard. A very simple visual is the square root symbol: √. When you start therapy, you start bringing down the barriers and then all of those emotions (that you had kept hidden for a reason) start pouring into you and you need to deal with them and that's exhausting. It can be really, really shitty. You're not able to function as well as you used to. Things that didn't bother you before now trigger you. You slide down. Then, as you process the emotions and the trauma and you learn to cope and improve communication and collaboration within your system, you gradually feel better and your life improves, until you end much 'higher' (healthier, more capable, emotionally stable) than you were before.

So, we have that to look forward to. But I get that this doesn't make it any easier to bear when you are on the 'sliding down' part of the process.

TL;DR Feeling exhausted or feeling shitty is part of the healing process. It is really tough, but it's also important to be able to feel and not to push the emotions away or run from them."
DID,fiq9fef,t3_f99nns,1582638883.0,"Yes. All my adult alters (including me) are sexual, although our relationship with sex seems to be quite different from each other. I'm not sure how much system sex goes on among us, but I often feel a lot of sexual tension or flirting between two alters, if they're close, and I have heard snatches of conversation or jokes that suggest that sex is happening in the headspace out of my 'sight'."
OSDD,fiq83zy,t3_f99811,1582637866.0,"Out of interest, why do you want to switch fully/step back?

Most healing books for complex dissociative disorders work towards increased co-consciousness and blending. The disorder exists because (through trauma and disorganised attachment) certain memories and feelings are too much to bear and are split off from consciousness and hidden behind amnesiac walls, forming separate 'states of being' or personality states/alters/parts/whatever you want to call them. The goal of therapy and healing is to break down these barriers so that parts can be aware of each other, accept each other and work together. Trying to separate parts further than they already are seems, to me at least, to be moving in the opposite direction."
DID,fi6aucj,t1_fi5918u,1582185900.0,"Good advice! In our system every adult part is sexually active but they all have different approaches to sex (to bond with someone; to let out frustration/stress; power play; to show love and affection; etc). We have a wonderful partner who is open to different types of sex, but even so some of us get urges to sleep with someone else or to, more commonly, to flirt and have sex with /every/ man (!!). To protect our relationship and ourself, we have some boundaries/rules written in our journal that we have agreed to. The most helpful one is that anything we do with ourself sexually is fine, regardless of how f****ed up the online searches become. Often being able to express the desires aloud (a mantra) or fantasise about them in detail while getting off is enough, even if we have to do this several times to get rid of the urge. And if that doesn't work for whoever is out then they just need to suck it up, to be brutally honest. We made an agreement to not sleep with anyone other than our partner and it is for the best of the whole system (for our system, anyway) if we don't. In our experience (not just sexually), knowing that something is absolutely forbidden without any leeway makes it easier to stick to and makes the urges easier to control."
DID,fg7cqnz,t3_ex9psk,1580589364.0,"So sorry to hear that you're going through a rough patch. Know that you are all strong and will be able to get through this, but try to be kind to yourself(yourselves) in the meantime. It's okay to slip a little when you're having a hard time.

I'm not sure if your parts generally disrespect your veganism or not, but it sounds to me as if your whole system is having a hard time and that they weren't able to hold it together/gave into their own coping mechanisms for a day. Criticising them or yourself isn't going to make things better and it'll probably make you all feel worse. Showing love and acceptance for yourself and your system is really key at this time.

For example, I (host) have always hated a particular part of my body being touched - even by clothes! - but when one of my alters was out and I was in the back seat, he got our partner to touch this area and was absolutely fine with it. He can also put his face underwater/in the jet of water from the shower, which I can never do.

Not sure it is predominantly a cis male trait though! The type of man you are describing, in my opinion, sounds as though he has subscribed to some rather toxic media/cultural tropes, and luckily my partner doesn't have any friends or other influences who are like that, so he doesn't view relationships or women in the way you are describing. (In fact, I would actively avoid dating someone who expressed those views, even as a joke - that attitude reminds me too much of the men on my mum's side of the family, who, because of trauma, make me feel sick).

I think the alters who don't love my partner are not interested in loving anyone, or are currently incapable of it - probably because of the vulnerability associated with those feelings. So it's less of a 'wanting to wander' or an 'I don't find you attractive' issue and more of an 'I'm too strong and independent to deal with your lovey dovey bullsh*t'.

I'm actually awake in the middle of the night writing this because he had itchy hands when he came to bed, so I woke up to him getting frustrated and the fear made me too awake to sleep.

I would argue that disorganised attachment can be traumatic, but perhaps he's separating this from physical or emotional abuse. Of course, if you have amnesia about something, you're not necessarily going to know that you have amnesia about it - that's the catch-22! I had some trauma in my late childhood/teens that I knew about and assumed was the root of my issues, but I can't remember a lot from my early childhood and some aspects of my memory (home life and parents before age 10) are patchy to the point of being virtually non-existent. I later discovered that something (or several somethings) had happened much earlier than the trauma I knew about. But until I discovered this, I had no idea.

If you have chunks of memory missing from your childhood, then this might be an argument for you having amnesia, even if you don't know what you've 'forgotten'. Not remembering much from 0-3 is super normal apparently, but if your memory is blank for many years beyond that, this might be an indication of amnesia. Or if there is one aspect of your life in particular that is empty of memories while you have lots of memories from the same time of other places/people, then this could also be an indication. I can remember a lot about my primary school, for instance, but very little about my home life."

So it's definitely possible to have alters keep early trauma memories from you, even if you share memories now in daily life.

At the time, I didn't know about DID, but I did tell her that this was another personality in my head and she accepted it. I still feel doubt and denial though whenever something new crops up. For instance, the past two weeks I've been aware of another alter and I've felt like such a fraud mentioning this alter to my (very accepting!) therapist.

And yep, I'm definitely an ANP! Although it so odd to say that - 'ANP' sounds like a type of robot to me!"
sex,f825jbu,t3_dyjljh,1574184427.0,"I did this a few years ago to stop myself from falling into an immediate rebound relationship after I broke up with an ex. I told the guys (usually on the first date) that I was casually dating and that I wasn't exclusive, and no one was put off by this. It was exhausting to date too many, so I ended up seeing two of them regularly for a couple of months, until stronger feelings developed between me and one of them. He was being exclusive with me because that's just how he dates (can't have feelings for two people at a time) and that it had got to the point that I was hurting him by continuing to see someone else, so I broke it off with the other man. I'm still happily dating the one I stayed with :)"
DID,f7rhv0c,t3_dxh5ln,1573981648.0,"Definitely not weird! The 'not knowing' is hard to hold, but it's important to understand that digging for trauma can cause a lot of distress in the system. I'm really trying to hold myself back from looking at the moment because an alter told me to slow down and to focus on learning my system better before learning about the past."
DID,f7oibt9,t1_f7oagcp,1573927922.0,This! Exactly this.
DID,f7oi7yk,t3_dx5k25,1573927870.0,"Yes, this is how I feel whenever someone else fronts. I don't know if it's because I'm the host, though? When I'm in control of the body, sometimes I can feel an alter nearby but at other times they're 'away' and I know that at least one of them (the one I have good communication with) spends a lot of time in the inner world. I've been shown parts of the inner world by this alter before, but I never really go there myself and I'm not very comfortable with it, so when someone else fronts I end up being pushed back a bit but am still very present in terms of I can feel what they're feeling, see what they're seeing, and hear them (both their spoken words and their thoughts): it is similar to what you're describing when you say you 'turn into them'. 

I'm so present when someone else fronts (because I don't go to the inner world) that I don't have any time to be 'me' because I'm so focused on what the fronting alter is experiencing/doing/thinking. It's only when I come back to the front that I feel like I was 'trapped' in the body and my memories of what happened while the alter was out are there but a bit fuzzy, like it was a dream."
DID,f7lzwdm,t1_f7lo7j0,1573851407.0,"It is really useful to hear your opinion and advice, and I'm definitely going to sit on this for a few days/a week (not sure when I'll get confirmation about the hours or when I'll need to send the email), so I may end up tempering the terminology! Probably I'd be happy with most of them knowing the basics, but I also want to think about what would happen if one of them chose to misuse the knowledge and whether I'd be okay with that/whether it would be worth the benefits of being open and building relationships."
DID,f7lp9mn,t1_f7l1daj,1573845402.0,"This is basically the definition of never showing vulnerability, which I understand but am not a proponent of. My protector (ex persecutor) part used to think in exactly this way, wanting to stamp down on any show of vulnerability and ensure that we were entirely self-sufficient. Having these skills is really important, and I trust that I would be able to get myself through anything on my own, if needed, but allowing other people in and letting them help is a much better way to live. It's pretty scary to be vulnerable, but I've been taking slow steps in this direction the last few years and have found it to be, for the most part, very rewarding and useful for healing."
DID,f7loqh9,t1_f7kx0lt,1573845071.0,"Thanks! I completely agree with this. I have boundaries and there are certainly elements of my disorder that I would be less keen to talk about, but I'd like to be open and honest about this within my comfortable boundaries. It's another testament to the good working environment and relationships I have that I expect my trust in them to be rewarded with support, and I would much rather this than to distrust them and be met with distrust in return.

Being vulnerable is really hard, especially if we've been hurt in the past, but if we're careful with who we choose to be vulnerable with, and to what extent, then it can be extremely rewarding."
DID,f7lo6q3,t1_f7kts6y,1573844737.0,"Thanks for the luck! If you google 'dissociative disorder' on a private browsing window, the sites that top the list give an okay explanation, including a few different disorders, so that I think they'd be able to get an idea of what I have. But I'm definitely going to focus on the PTSD aspects of the disorder if they ask me any questions in person, as I'm more comfortable explaining that than mentioning parts/alters! And, as you say, they're more likely to understand and accept this side of things too."
DID,f7lnt93,t1_f7kztw8,1573844496.0,"I feel like this is great advice for a large corporate environment, but in my case it is likely to alienate team members more to be so vague about it, as it suggests that there's no trust there. I know there's no compulsion on me to tell them, but I'd rather they knew a little bit and could ask me direct questions (to which I can set boundaries) than that they felt as though they should tiptoe around me or talk behind my back, wondering what could possibly cause me to reduce my hours (an unusual thing to do, apparently, unless you're having a child!)"
DID,f7lngq5,t1_f7l9wn3,1573844280.0,"On the official forms I've vaguely mentioned mental health and therapy, and my workplace is really good with this, so I doubt anything will come from it. For my colleagues, I think that being too vague will actually result in a worse reaction as it's quite a close team and if they don't feel as though they can come and ask me directly about it then they might be more likely to talk about it behind my back. I can't stand people thinking false things about me, so I'd like to be truthful with them but set boundaries if they ask me to expand on it more."
DID,f7ln0ri,t1_f7l8iay,1573844006.0,"Sorry! Didn't mean to attack you in any way!! I don't want to make the email too long by listing all my co-morbidities (I considered writing anxiety as that's really well known, but I wanted to show that it was more than that). I'll probably mention ptsd if any of them ask me more in person though, since you're right that it's much easier to explain! I googled 'dissociative disorder' on a private browsing window (so it didn't use my search history to filter results) and the top few results are pretty good medical sites that list a few different dissociative disorders, so I think I'm safe enough using this term without anyone assuming that I have DID or alternative personalities."
CPTSD,f7llpk3,t1_f7lj62i,1573843193.0,"So relatable! I have managed to heal enough to cry in front of others now, but when my fiancé and I broke up a few years ago, it still took me over a month before I told my mum because I wanted to feel strong enough in my own emotions to handle hers when I told her."
AskDID,f7aytpl,t3_dv0v0l,1573546433.0,"Hi from the UK! I'm in a similar position in that my therapist has told me I have 'a dissociative disorder' and given me materials to read about DID (a PODS booklet - check out their website too; there is plenty of good information there). We are already following the recommended treatment plan of long term, one to one psychotherapy, and I'm reassured by her that this is the right path to take, so I've decided not to pursue an official diagnosis as it isn't really needed and it would cost money as I'd probably need to go for a private assessment (the alternative is the NHS, which is notoriously bad for this type of disorder). The other reason I would rather not have an official diagnosis is that you do need to disclose it in certain circumstances: on job applications (where they are not allowed to discriminate, but...); when getting health or life insurance (which is important when buying a house, for instance); and, as mentioned by another commenter, when adopting. It would be useful for telling friends and family, but if I am getting a diagnosis I want to get it for me, not for other people. And the friends and family that I choose to tell about my disorder are the ones who are likely to believe me without needing a piece of paper to prove it (and, on the flip side, someone who doesn't want to believe it can easily reject the diagnosis and say that they mistrust medical professionals). It boils down to trust. If you are convinced by your therapist and are already getting the correct treatment, then you probably don't need an official diagnosis."
DID,f6tu4ze,t3_dsz6by,1573154106.0,"Ditto other comments in that I usually hear my alter's thoughts as I'd hear mine (but they are discernable as his because of the tone, words used or intent/feeling that accompanies them).

Sometimes he can be quite 'lazy' though and instead of the thoughts forming proper words or sentences, I just get a sense of what he's saying. I can't stand communication like this, because the conversation moves too fast and I get lost, so I usually end up verbalising his 'thoughts' (his intent or feeling or too-quick-for-proper-words communication) so that I can make more sense of it before I reply."
DID,f5ldibi,t3_do8ifj,1572277131.0,"I understand your desire to recover lost memories and build a coherent timeline, but the memories you're searching for are most likely held by the other parts of you. These are your best 'resources' and the way to 'mine' them is to build up communication.

These memories (and feelings) were split off from us into parts and fragments because they were too much to deal with, and if your communication with your alters isn't yet at the point where they will willingly share these memories and feelings with you, then you may not yet be ready to discover them. Because once they're out in the open, you'll need to work through them with the part of you that is stuck in that past time - and that will be much easier to do if the memory was shared willingly and you're facing it together rather than you having forced it into consciousness. I am by no means an expert but, speaking from my own experience, I suspect this is why one (or more) of your parts is hindering you from accessing the memories in this way.

Building up communication can be a difficult and long process, but it's the safest and healthiest way to face this disorder.

grammar,f0vryua,t3_d6qhbm,1568990321.0,"Perhaps it sounds odd to you because it rhymes? It is correct, but you could also write 'All sorts of scanners' if you want to find an alternative."
grammar,ez0c6nn,t3_czrfr8,1567634632.0,"The first example is correct: you need a comma before 'running' to make it clear that the 18-wheeler is doing the running, not 'her'.

The comma after 'later' and before 'an' is optional and depends on which style you're using. You can choose to put a comma after an introductory phrase or not, so long as you're consistent.

So, while your first example is correct, it would equally be correct to write:

""Seconds later an 18-wheeler whooshed past her, running over the eagle and leaving a dark stain on the street."""
OSDD,exiful1,t1_ex6v9zh,1566327458.0,"Thanks for the welcome!

I'm in the UK and am not sure exactly how it works here, but I have a really good rapport with the counsellor I was seeing (and am hoping to see again when she become available) and I know that she can't officially diagnose. This doesn't bother me, though, as I'd rather just talk with her and work through my issues than get a label."
OSDD,ewsqevp,t1_ewm8sbk,1565733041.0,"Yes, I thought so: it just seems oddly unintuitive to start picking and choosing the relevant bits from DID literature/threads, since normally this picking and choosing approach is a sure-fire way to wrongly self-diagnose with any disorder under the sun."
OSDD,ewspme2,t1_ewm636f,1565732533.0,This is super useful – thank you! It's a shame that OSDD isn't the focus of any current books but these look like they'll be able to give me lots of insights.
AskDID,ewlec0y,t1_ewkpnhk,1565520032.0,"This is exactly what I have and it is so refreshing to hear someone else describe it! Most of what I've read on Reddit is focused on DID rather than OSDD(1b) and I've been struggling to relate. The experiences people have with DID and OSDD can be so different that it is often difficult to find something relatable, but this is spot on."
OSDD,ewj6pvi,t3_bnsazb,1565462129.0,"Hi, I'm happy to be known simply as N here. Never been officially diagnosed as I've only seen counsellors, not a psychiatrist, but I've had a couple of years counselling and am hoping to go back soon (needed a break after my relationship ended and I no longer felt in a good enough place to explore deeper issues, but am feeling secure again now).

I've had one very clear and developed 'alter' personality co-existing in my head since I was 11 or so. I am the host, but S occasionally fronts with me co-conscious. He is definitely a protector and I suspect he has memories of abuse/trauma that he is protecting me from as I can't remember much from my early years. He used to act as a persecutor when I was younger (in a bizarre way, this was to protect me by stopping me from stumbling upon any internal knowledge of the abuse) but since I discovered his motives our relationship has changed for the better."
