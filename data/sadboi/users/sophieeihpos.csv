I was in a similar situation my freshman year, fall semester. I didn’t even know mental illness counted as a disability! I took the spring off, transferred schools, and I’ve been working with my school’s disability office since then and I’m doing a lot better.

Once I had accepted what happened to me, and began getting treatment for PTSD, I was completely unable to be intimate with my partner for quite a while.

Now, I am no longer in a relationship, and I have come a long way with healing from my trauma. I really don’t think I could be intimate with someone I wasn’t close with (like I wouldn’t be able to have a one night stand or anything like that). I think I am ready to try being intimate again, but since I’m not in a relationship with anyone at the moment, that’s on the back burner for now. When I meet someone that I’m ready to be intimate with, I think I’m ready, but I definitely think I’ll need to work on it in therapy at the same time.

Although I will say, it was kind of shitty that your friend blew you off for Stacey...it seems to me like you were just the second option because Stacy already ate.
