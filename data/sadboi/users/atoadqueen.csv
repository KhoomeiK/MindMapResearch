EffexorSuccess,fqmeupf,t3_gjhwfa,1589476279.0,"I am prone to ecxema and live in a dry climate, but I noticed increased skin dryness in general. I thought the raised red lines was normal until this post! I've had that my whole life. I also have keratosis pilaris (lifelong). Any number of things could affect your skin like that. Personally, I haven't associated the skin dryness with Effexor, with the exception of one patch of insane dryness (eczema or psoriasis) on my face when I first started Effexor. It finally went away with some hydrocortisone cream.

I always thought it was hard water or the dry climate or a combination of a few things. I'll keep an eye on it, though. 

From the personal vault, some things I do to keep the itch & dryness at bay:

* Moisturize after every shower. I loathe having to do this, but it helps oh-so much. 
* Exfoliate your body. Weekly does the trick for me. 
* Urea moisturizer cream: My heels are ridiculous dry & cracked on a good day. This helps to soften them. If another body part is particularly dry, a bit of this on that patch will help it out. 
* Sauna or steam. 
* Vitamin E is lovely for the skin. 

A lot of this routine is because I live in a dry climate. It's rare to find someone who *isn't* needing moisturizer here."

Hint Three: You can add all sorts of details or expansions you want. (See [https://www.sophia.org/tutorials/asl-expansion-techniques](https://www.sophia.org/tutorials/asl-expansion-techniques)). These are more interpreting techniques than linguistics.

Hint Four: Sometimes I use glosses over the text of source language. It helps when I am writing notes for the delivery of the target language.

Hint Five: Remember your non-manual markers (NMM) - facial expressions, movement, speed, etc. For example, the intent of ""Landscape was rural area"" can be enhanced by NMMs to indicate it was glorious, beautiful, bland, icky, etc.

relationship_advice,fqex79p,t3_gi9vko,1589315080.0,"A story for hope: My sister has endometriosis & PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). She and her husband struggled for years to get pregnant. She found an amazing doctor and endocrinologist. IVF worked the second time around. They had twins — a boy and a girl! Then they planned and had another son, conceived naturally. Then they had a fourth kid, who was definitely unplanned. So now my sister who had that high chance of never having kids has a full household of little ones running around.

Then there’s me: I have the same health issues my sister has. I always thought I wanted to settle down, have kids. I never wanted to have a kid on my own, so I always used birth control despite the low risk of getting pregnant. Relationships never worked out & we never were stable enough together to plan for kids. I did miscarry once in my early 20’s. In my mid 30’s now and I definitely do *not* want to be a mom. I love being an auntie. I have a dog that my nieces & nephews love to play with. I love being that auntie that gets to do the fun things with the kids and be a positive adult role model in their life. There are things they talk to me about that they can’t talk to their parents about. I love that special role an auntie plays in a kid’s life."

Setting: its daylight savings in the spring when we lose an hour. It suddenly goes from 1:59 am to 3 am. I live downtown, heading in the general direction of home when I decide to go get a bite to eat. 

On my walk, I run into this guy who is just finishing work. He asks where I’m going. I tell him. He asks if he can join me to grab some food. Sure! Why not? He has a vehicle, so I hop in. Meanwhile he has acknowledged that he’s definitely not going to murder me and the second I say I’d like to go home, he’ll drive me. He was trustworthy.

We pull into the parking lot of the place I wanted to eat. He suggests a better place. He mentions the area of town it’s in. I thought I heard him say an area that’s a good 30 minute drive from there. I ask “Come again? Where?” Yep. It’s the place 30 minutes from our current location. But he assured me it’s the best place to get the best food at this time of night. 

We drive there. He’s pleasant. Tells me where he’s from originally & how he ended up in Canada. Legitimately a really cool guy. We got donairs. He was right. It was delicious. I’m not a huge fan of donairs & that was the only donair I’ve had in my life, but it was delicious.

So we drive around some more. Eat donairs. Talk. I started to get tired (it’s 5 am at this point), so he drives me home. 

Never saw him again. Just a good night with a stranger. 

Just one of those things I did once & would never do again. Granted, I have hindsight that now tells me that was a risky decision & I was just lucky."

datingoverthirty,fq7i3ys,t3_gh5qbq,1589146680.0,"My uncle did something like this. He had been seeing an amazing woman. He was in his 30’s, never married, great career, all around “husband” material. He’s always been a great guy. I don’t know how long they were together, but it was long enough that she had met his extended family (ie, his nieces, nephews, parents). He had an amazing career opportunity overseas. He had to decide: amazing opportunity or amazing relationship.

I don’t know if they did or not — this was more than 25 years ago and I was young. However, my uncle is the sort of guy who I could see talking with his partner about this. It’s a damn shame this guy never talked to you at all about his decision. 

**Hope for you:** each of them had happy lives; they went their different ways, lived separate lives. She went on to meet another man, locally. I believe she’s married. He went on and had amazing opportunities, everything he hoped it would be. 


**Understanding:** I have *also* been in the “what the f- -k just happened” situation. After spending a long day together, part of which included me gathering stuff from my place so I could spend the night at his, I was getting ready for bed when he rushes into the room to frantically tell me that he wants to break up. I made him explain it to me while I had my pants off. Figured if he was going to make me wonder WTF, I would too. 

**Wise Words?:** The whole situation just sucks. For whatever reason, he has decided to move on with his life. [Just like The Littlest Hobo](https://i.imgur.com/60qBRKN.jpg). You can speculate all you want — maybe it’s fear-based, maybe he’s his own top ten priorities, maybe he just makes bad life decisions right now, maybe in two weeks he’ll realize he made a crazy decision and try to get you back. 

Keep your checklist of qualities you do and don’t want in a partner. Add one like this: someone who is willing to be open with you about where he is in his life. You may not see it now, but there *is* a silver lining somewhere. Who knows what or where it is. As vulnerable as it makes you feel, keep hoping. 

Heartbreak sucks. I feel ya."
EffexorSuccess,fq6eqk2,t1_fq1wh0s,1589130099.0,"You are welcome! Keeping them close by definitely is the most helpful thing for me.  The side effects are certainly worth it. 

I guess the side effects are mostly the same whether I miss or take it late. If I miss a dose, the effects will feel more intense. If I take it late (which is usually about 4 hours later than normal). Just so happens that this weekend I took a dose a few (4-5) hours later, so these are just what I went through this weekend. It could be different for everyone. 

-	Intense, vivid dreams. Sometimes I’ll wake up laughing, screaming, super anxious depending on the dream — but they seem life-like. 
-	Upper body tension, headache. This very well could because of sleeping in a weird position, though. Usually a hot compress or some anti-inflammatory rub helps relieve the pain. If I full on miss a dose, the headache can become a migraine. 
-	Brain zaps. It feels like a bolt of electricity right between your eyes & gives you a bit of a “whoa” light-headed sensation. It’s not comfortable, but it’s not exactly debilitating. I read somewhere that taking omega 3-6-9 can help to reduce the sensation of these. 
-	Heightened anxiety. I’ve noticed this mostly  a few days after missing a dose. That’s why I put something to remind myself for the next week to just take it slow."
EffexorSuccess,fpzv8kx,t3_gg8tqm,1589024178.0,"Socially distanced high five! Same here. Effexor has been the only Rx that has made me feel stable. I have my regular ups and downs, but they're within a reasonable limit. For the first time in my adult life, I feel like I have a normal thought processing and normal range of emotions. Realizing this has been empowering. 

I usually take my dose about 9:00 pm. My Goldilocks zone is 8:30 pm-9:30 pm. If I take it after 10:00 pm, I know I'll be feeling it later. 

I am terrible at tracking time. Many times I have long passed the Goldilocks zone before remembering to take the prescription. There are a few things I do to alert myself to this. They're not foolproof and I still miss the Goldilocks zone. In case these strategies might help, here are a few of them:

* Keep the Rx close by. I keep two spare doses in my purse/car for the times I am out of the house and the Goldilocks time hits. 
* Timers/Alarms: I have an alarm set for 8:30, letting me know it is close to the time. Another one at 9:00 to let me know to just take it. The alarms are helpful if I have hyper-focused on something & lost track of time or if I have a surprise nap after an exhausting day.  
* When I *do* miss a dose or take it outside of the Goldilocks zone, I know I won't sleep well. In those cases, I use a herbal cocktail capsule that helps me sleep and wake up feeling rested. I've tried a few -- some make me wake up feeling groggy/drugged, but this one seems to be just lovely. 
* Knowing that I'll feel like crap in a few days, I'll add a sticker or something to my agenda for a few day later or the next week to remind myself to just breathe and use strategies to stay grounded."
mentalillness,fpzey6k,t3_gfxvw0,1589017379.0,"This, 100%. For me, it’s not so bad with relationships. I have come to understand that friends will be friends through thick and thin. I repeat that mantra with relationships.  I question almost everything I do. Laughing — was it too loud? That joke — will I have to explain it? That email — was it too abrasive? How much my life revolves around my dog — are people sick of it? It causes most anxiety for me at work. So many times, my mind goes back to certain memories, like when I overheard my mom calling me (at 7-10 years old) the most selfish person. I’ve carried that with me for decades, even though I know reasonably that my seven year old self and adult self are incomparable. 

I jump hurdles when judging my own impulses and purchases. As a recent example: I wanted to go on a vacation. It was totally doable financially and time-wise. Before booking it, I talked with my support system* to get their input: is this a manic decision or is it normal? This sort of thought process is my accepted normal:

*Having a support system has been critical to stay mentally grounded. When my mind starts to take flight or is weighed down with infinite burdens, I use my personal coping mechanism & my support system can carry some of the weight when they can."

Understanding:
Dealt with this my whole life, too. I grew up on a farm and the closest/only neighbour my age was a guy. This may have been what established how I connect with people. As an adult, I have been invited to bachelor parties as a “Female [Insert Groom’s Name]”. It’s a good time. Then there are the times I just want to be a female. It took a long ass time, but I finally do have some solid women friends who I can talk to about *anything*. 

Suggestions:
* Maintain the friendship
* Join a hobby club. Crochet, book club, movies, sport, gardening, gaming, etc. 
* Hone social skills & conquer shyness (with the understanding that sometimes mental illness can be a barrier)
* Go out on your own & be open to talking with people. Meet a hetero couple? Focus on conversation with the wife/girlfriend. Meet a lesbian couple? Potentially two new friends.

The most obvious physical symptom is this almost electric lightning flash type sensation right between my eyes. It’s bizarre. Totally harmless on its own, but definitely take extra care if you’re driving or something. I treat it the same way I would treat a migraine: stay in the dark as much as possible, sunglasses when I go outside, drink more water, keep my blood-sugar levels up, sleep if I need to, but certainly take time to lay down. I have had full on migraines the day after missing a day, too. 

A symptom I recently have noticed is a few days *after* missing the dose, my anxiety will increase. This can happen up to a week after missing a dose. Whether it’s connected or not, I don’t know. 

Good luck! After guinea pigging several other types of prescriptions, Effexor has been the most effective for me. I’m on a steady dose & quite relieved to have found something that stabilizes my brain function."

It seems like the difference is those guys are good friends who bullshit with each other as their way to bond, not divide. The comments here seemed more divisive, almost insulting just to cut someone down. They weren’t productive to make the show better. If I don’t like something and I don’t have to subscribe to it, I don’t subscribe to it. Easy. Example: I’m a die hard fan of The X Files. I still refuse to watch seasons 8 & 9 of The X Files: No Mulder, no X Files. When they put Mulder & Scully into a romantic relationship in the second movie, I threw a pillow at the TV and turned off the movie. Eventually, I became okay with the idea. I still don’t like it, but ... it’s okay. So, with TESD if people don’t like at all, unsubscribe. If they don’t like parts of it, deal or make a productive suggestion that can actually be implemented. 

Honestly, I never thought of the podcast as one that spread misinformation. They have a looooot of ramblings that are hilariously inaccurate. This is an example: the word “sirloin” because it’s from a bull, which is a “sir,” and from the “loins” area. I choked on my water from laughing so hard! They looked into it for like 2 minutes and were like “Yeah. Makes sense. That cut of meat is above the loins.”  The loin part, it’s right. But the sir part? Noooo!

No one can be reduced to being a simply bad person for knowing they have mental illness and going untreated.
