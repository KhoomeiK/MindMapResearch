Maybe he just forgot. Maybe he doesn’t care. So what. Most kids at that age aren’t good about maintaining friendships except if it’s held together by a mutual activity u all do or something. I’m 20 man and I’ve basically kind of accepted that I’m not the type of person to have lots of friends and I only hangout with ppl maybe once a week or so during a good time. A good way to make some friends and make sure u see them often is thru getting a job where u work with other ppl u enjoy talking to.

Yes I always had feelings for her and even today if she randomly sent me a text out of the blue (we still keep up even tho she’s in a dif state now) saying she started developing feelings somehow (she won’t ever, just a scenario), I would totally drop everything and try to make it work with her. She’s been a great person all the years I’ve known her and she really is beautiful. She’s gone on to date other guys and she’s made it very clear she only sees me as a friend. Does it suck? Yea. Do u eventually get over it? Yea. Especially if y’all have never done anything together. 

What you’re feeling for her that’s making u think about her constantly is infatuation. It tends to do that, it kinda sucks sometimes (believe me Ik).

Really sucked. I was heartbroken and I actually did love this girl. She’s been thru a lot and has had family issues and even a sexual assault episode in her past, so she hasn’t had the best life. She still to this day hasn’t apologized or really even addressed the situation at all. I tried to get answers out of her on why she did it and what I even was to her, but she couldn’t answer me. I tried to call her and talk to her multiple times but she’d avoid and refuse to pickup the phone. Looking back I’m ashamed that I even begged for answers. I shouldn’t have needed any. She treated me awfully even when we were ‘dating’ and caused me a lot of unnecessary anxiety. 

Now it’s been a few weeks since I last texted her and I don’t plan on ever reaching out again. Sometimes I’m tempted and almost everything reminds me of her just cuz we had so much in common, but I also know that the girl I loved is gone and dead forever. I really do hope she gets better and sorts her life out, and at one point I wanted to help her with her issues and I would’ve done anything for her but things r too broken now and I don’t think they could ever b fixed.

It’s been 2 months now, things r certainly better and there r moments where I feel good, life isn’t just a blanket of depression anymore like it was at the beginning. If I could give u one piece of advice is to distance yourself from her as much as possible and put her on NoContact. Don’t call/text her, dont check her social media, dont beg for her to come back. Everytime I interacted with my ex after things ended things got bad for me again. Just continue to get things done in your own life. Make a list of productive things u want to get done everyday. 

Things certainly arent the best for me, but they are a lot better then they were. Time is the ultimate healer. 

Oh and one last thing, keep in mind that she’s not the only girl in the world. While it may seem impossible rn, you will find love with someone else.

He actually had a vision of the destruction of the temple, only he was the one in Anakin’s position. Afterwards Maul said it felt so real he could ‘smell the smoke’ from the temple.

socialskills,fn2fiay,t3_fyins5,1586587193.0,"I too am also introverted and was shy all throughout my younger years, but over the years I’ve gotten really good at having conversations (when I choose to). 

Often times shy people ‘don’t know how to respond’ to certain things ppl say or do. What I’ve realized is that when ppl say something to me, most times it makes me think of a story or an event or just something that might’ve occurred around me that I noticed and I’ll bring that up and talk about that. It doesn’t matter if u think it’s ‘appropriate’ or ‘the right thing to say’, that doesn’t matter and u need to stop thinking about conversations as something u can map out and study for or something like that. You have to take what the other person says to u and go with it. I’ve gotten so good at this that most times I now talk much more then most of my friends when I want to. 

And if you’re confused when it comes to asking questions, that’s even easier imo. Just ask questions when u actually have a question about something they said, or would like them to explain it further. Some ppl try to confuse u and say that u can’t ask about certain things cuz it makes u seem dumb or rude or whatever, but once again, conversations aren’t paths u have to correctly navigate or formulas u have to calculate. You can take a conversation wherever u want to take them and u can’t get caught up and worried about  ‘things going correctly’. 

I also have done lots of reading and watching movies/tv so I think studying charismatic characters in those stories have also really helped me. Given me lots of good lines and phrases to say. Also my sarcasm and banter levels have gotten much better cause of it too."

AskReddit,fmsobvu,t3_fwx9pc,1586359296.0,"I sympathize with, believe it or not, Darth Maul. I’m big into Star Wars and it’s expanded universe and I’ve read quite a bit of material on Maul (he’s my favorite character after all), and one book in particular described his upbringing and Sith training from an early age, and you can tell in the beginning of the book when he was taken from his mother (Mother Talzin) and Maul was still just a child that Maul was just a regular kid, who just wanted to know a life outside of his cramped training quarters on Mustafar.

When Mail started getting older and Sidious’ Sith teachings started turning him into an emotionless killing machine, I also felt bad for him then because the book had so many asides where Maul was just thinking in his head, and frankly he had extreme potential to be a great Sith. He was in peak physical shape, a master with his lightsaber, and had braved every grueling challenge his master had thrown at him. He even had a vision in the book where HE was the one in Anakin’s place who destroyed the Jedi Temple and killed all the Jedi in it. After the vision was over, he said it felt so real that he could smell the smoke, and of course the vision was partially true, just not the part about him doing it. My point is is that Maul had the motivation and the potential to be a great Sith and I always hated Obi-Wan a bit for ruining everything for Maul in Ep I."
CasualConversation,fmnohva,t3_fvzc9z,1586231005.0,"I graduated a couple years ago, I nvr went parties, school dances, football games or attended any school functions at all. I sort of ostracized myself because every group I tried to hang out with didn’t really care if I was around, and some just straight up made fun of me. I only attended graduation because I was forced to. Honestly it was a pretty boring waste of a few hours. But I remember at least I joked around with the cute girl I was seated next to so that made it bearable. 

If u can tell I did not like HS, and I would not have minded if it had all gotten canceled because of some virus.

Also I have a younger brother who is a senior this year and he feels the exact same way. In fact his words this morning were “Actually I love this quarantine, it’s helped me so much”."

self,fmivnl4,t3_fvblfm,1586117845.0,"Sorry that had to happen to you man. As someone who was on the opposite end of that whole thing exactly a month ago, (I was the person she cheated with, I had no idea she had a bf the whole time), I dmed the bf a long thing about how srry I was and sent him evidence to prove it. We talked things out together and helped each other along the next few days when things were still fresh. We still follow each other on snap to this day. Thing is is that I’m pretty sure both him and her have moved on from the whole thing by now and I still struggle with it to this day. I’ve thought about it all a lot, over and over again. I really thought this girl and I fit really well together and I thought I’d finally found someone I really loved (she was my first kiss, handhold, first gf experience really). But looking back she really did treat me horribly at times and she caused me a lot of unneeded stress and anxiety. A big part of me is glad it’s over, but another still yearns for her and still thinks about all the great dates we had together. 

My biggest advice to u right now while the wound is fresh is to talk it out with as many ppl as u can and just vent to anyone who will listen. It’s actually very cathartic to let it out, and there’s going to be a lot to let out. Keep a journal and write out ur thoughts daily if u have to. Get back into contact with your closest friends and get even closer to them. Thankfully I’ve had a real great friend throughout all of this who’s reminded me that I deserve better then the way she treated me and has been there for me any time I needed someone.

It might b hard since this is the third times it’s happened, but don’t go full incel and write off all girls as cheaters and liars. There r good girls out there u just have to look in the right places."
Meditation,flsx1bf,t3_fqnsx0,1585453002.0,"I totally understand where ur coming from dude. I too had a cheating gf who basically used me to cheat on a bf she had already had but I had no idea existed until 3 weeks ago. I don’t know what she’s doing anymore these days or if she found someone else cuz she won’t even talk to me about any of it, never even said sorry for all the shitty things she put me thru during that relationship. I’m a younger dude, 20, and she was my first relationship and my first kiss, handhold, all that shit. But still tbh ur situation sounds much worse then mine, we were only together for like 3 months, a year and a half sounds awful dude. 

But yea this whole virus quarantine isn’t helping me get over her and basically all I’ve been thinking about since I found out about what she was doing is her and trying to resist texting her about wth even happened or just to send her some shit we used to send each other all the time. 

Thing is is that Ik that the relationship was pretty toxic, at least for me, and it was unhealthy from the start. I looked over so many red flags and like I said she def did not prioritize the relationship all that much a lot of the time. I don’t know y I still miss her and think about her so much because like I said Ik that relationship was not good for me. But she was my first real love, and frankly I’ve found I can’t just stop loving someone so easily, despite all the shitty stuff she’s done.

Just know that you’re not alone right now, even though it might seem like you are. You’ll get thru this eventually man, and meet someone better. Time is the ultimate healer."

seduction,fkw1vvs,t3_fkpowf,1584581576.0,"Practice by doing it over text with girls you might b friends with or girls u find attractive or what not. 

Watch a lot of movies and pick up on what it means to have a bold and boisterous personality. This means good phraseology, using lots of references, perhaps knowing lots of good quotes, all these r good things.

Sarcasm is your best friend during these times"

socialskills,fkpiw8j,t3_fjd69c,1584411214.0,"Honestly OP it seems like you’ve described my life the past few years. And now that I just went thru a bad breakup with my ex over the past couple weeks, things have gotten even worse for me and I can’t do anything I used to enjoy doing anymore as I used to do it. I used to spend all day in my room watching twitch and YouTube or napping when I wasn’t at school or at work. Hardly hung out with friends and I think I used work as my daily social time mostly. I’ve had no choice but to try to reinvent myself and try new things and be a bit more explorative with my life and actually try to have friends and hang out with them. I even had to get a new job otherwise I probably wouldve drove myself into a deep depression just thinking my same depressing thoughts over again. 

It’s so funny cuz as someone who also suffers with this dry cycle of habit, Ik u probably don’t like change either but I’ve realized that change is the only thing that’s going to make me happy anymore. Like I said I can’t live the way I could for years prior."

IWantToLearn,fkmc2d4,t3_fj23fq,1584325437.0,"I’m probably not the best at story telling from an objective standpoint, because I tend to tangent a lot and my mind often jumps around things, but if I’m around ppl I trust and know they won’t judge me, I can be very energetic and vary my tone and use my hands and tell it pretty interestingly. I love telling stories about things I’ve done or learned to anyone that will listen and not judge me for it. I think it comes from reading a lot when I was younger and watching lots of movies and picking up on mannerisms from them. Lots of ppl when they first meet me think I’m quiet and reserved, but when I’m around ppl I feel comfortable around, I’m often the most talkative of the bunch."

socialskills,fkg7cc4,t3_fi23uw,1584151779.0,"I’ll take a shot at this, I’m a 20 year old dude going to community college rn and I deal with a boatload of social anxiety. I’ve gotten better at talking and conversation and stuff over the years, but I still have trouble initiating conversation and eye contact and all that.

1. My biggest struggle is lack of close, committed friends I can rely on and trust to always be there. It seems like people besides my mom, dad and brother r always rotating in and out of my life and it makes it impossible to actually properly open up to anyone and I end up having no real friends or friend groups at the end of the day. 

2. Something ppl can do to help is just to b open and reach out. I’ve found that in every relationship I actually treasure I always have to be the one putting in work to hang out and communicate and all that. It just seems like no one else puts in work into my friendships and if I just let things drop then often times they do too."
relationship_advice,fkdetpt,t3_fhqslg,1584076294.0,"I recently ‘dated’ (long story) a girl who did things similar to this. She wouldn’t necessarily b probing thru my things wondering if I’m cheating (cuz spoiler alert she actually was), but she was always horrible at dealing with confrontation and I could never have a serious talk with her where I could actually get some real answers out of her rather then ‘ok’ and ‘I understand’. She also had a history of doing the crying thing too when she couldn’t bear to fess up her to faults. It’s exhausting and makes it impossible to hold a relationship together when one person simply can’t communicate effectively. I’d say just end it dude, Ik I can’t see it now, but It’ll save u lots of trouble down the road."
teenrelationships,fkde5co,t3_fhkh8j,1584075662.0,"I was recently in a similar situation to u and let me tell u it was frustrating to date a girl that much younger then me because she was at times very immature with things and didn’t take our relationship seriously. Also it turned out the whole time I was ‘dating’ her, she was cheating on her bf who she apparently had had the entire time but didn’t really care for that much so she started seeing me and never really ended things with him, but of course she never told me this until I found out a week ago. 

So yea we’ve broken up by now and I’ve realized that I, as an adult, deserve a lot better then to deal with problems of a child."
