I've never seen my little brother so determined about something. We tried the NMT and mystery island method - didn't work. No Raymond. We tried the campsite method (time traveling until someone shows up in the campsite) - didn't work as for now. We're 3 years ahead in the game and Raymond hasn't shown up yet. We've spend sleepless nights grinding for NMT and timeskipping weeks ahead for this cat. The sad part is, yes, if we put together every NMT we've wasted, we'd probably be able to buy him from someone, but we always had hope he'd show up in the next island and there goes 100+ tickets of trying. I'm not from the USA, so paying $20 for him or NMT on ebay translates to roughly $105 to us, so it's out of question. I'm still trying the campsite method but no luck."

Chris, the main character, not only became a stereotype of his own, but he can bring up all kinds of emotions in us. Sometimes, we laugh *with* him, sometimes we laught *at* him. Sometimes we pity him, sometimes we pity the people who have to put up with his shenanigans every day. Some people hate him enough to the point they interact with him to change the Christory, and some people just want to see him finally thrive in life. Either way, Chris sticks to us. It's the kind of character that even if you hate him to death, he's still imprinted inside of our minds, be it in a caring manner or in a example of what *not* to do. Chris's life has many arcs, and Chris keeps changing as these arcs go on, too. Some people call her Christine. Some people stick to the male pronoun, affirming that he can't discern if he's really trans or not. Some people miss the old Chris from the Love Quest, some people prefer seeing him dating his OCs.
