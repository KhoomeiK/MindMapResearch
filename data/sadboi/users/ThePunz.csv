depression,fpmm6c1,t1_fpmaszh,1588736166.0,"I relate to this a lot. I love my friends and I would do almost anything for them. I try my best to check up on them and to help them in any way I can. I feel like they don't really care or notice though.
A few of them know to an extent what I'm struggling with and have offered to talk and stuff, but I don't feel like they actually care tbh :/"
depression,fp5dej1,t3_gb9vlh,1588325193.0,This is a repost. Are people really that desperate for internet points that they'll farm r/depression :/
depression,fm9g5sz,t1_fm7k879,1585868061.0,"She has mentioned one or two things before and she relates to what I'm experiencing. She doesn't really bring up any of her own worries herself though which I'm unsure is because she doesn't trust me enough, or  she simply doesn't have anything too pressing that she would want to share. 
I wish we were closer though. I have met her a couple of times in person but we generally only talk through snapchat and the like."
depression,fm70dk9,t1_fm6zy4f,1585808837.0,"Thanks for the encouragement buddy :) I'm not quite ready to give up yet. 
I've got an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, I'm praying that he can help me make sense of stuff"
depression,fm6uk7t,t1_fm6qlnp,1585803667.0,"I see where you're coming from, and it does make sense. I don't really know why but I just don't feel comfortable talking to my family about anything like this. It's not their fault at all, they're honestly great, it's just me that's wrong somehow"
depression,fm6pxew,t1_fm6k8ev,1585800015.0,"I'm not 100% sure if I'm honest. 
I like her a lot as a person. She's kind, caring and she seems to understand somewhat what I'm going through - I don't feel as alone around her.
I just like the idea of having someone who loves me for exactly who I am despite everything. And to have someone whom I can show love to and care for.
I know it's kinda sappy and stupid"
depression,fm5xmqr,t1_fm5x00s,1585782044.0,Haha I get where you're coming from about not being tied down. But I kinda want to be 'tied down' I think if that makes? Like I want to have some reason or somebody to stay here for you know?
depression,fm5it2x,t1_fm4z6of,1585773745.0,Thank you for your kind words :)
depression,fm5ia90,t1_fm4o96t,1585773472.0,"Yeah, kind of. 
There are a few things that I really wish for like having a relationship with this person for example. But tbh, there isn't much that I really want or that I strive to achieve. 
There isn't really anything to keep me here and I think that's part of the problem."

I haven't really spoken about this with anyone yet. I might bring it up with my therapist."
depression,fm5gc7c,t1_fm4d70q,1585772427.0,Thanks buddy. I understand what you're going through and I hope things will get better for you
depression,fm3tljc,t1_fm3r4pd,1585736519.0,I'm not really sure tbh. There's really not much that I enjoy doing so idk what I would spend anything on

Even after just talking with you as little as I have, you seem like a really nice person and I'm sure you aren't a burden on your friends at all. They're lucky to have you"
depression,fkn14tn,t1_fkn0rjn,1584348632.0,"I guess maybe I'm scared that she won't understand. I really like her, and I don't want to weird her out or push her away sort of thing. I think it is largely in our minds though - especially if people have been telling you that you're fine"
depression,fkn03mz,t1_fkmzg1g,1584347278.0,I have talked a bit about it with her and she's super supportive which I'm so grateful for. But I feel guilty like I'm just dragging her down or offloading my problems onto her. Sometimes I feel like cutting myself off from people because i feel like I'm weighing them down.
depression,fkmw6uh,t3_fj8mva,1584342464.0,"I relate to this so much. I see my friends and feel like I don't bring anything good to them. One friend knows my situation and she is soo good to me, but I feel like I'm just weighing her down and taking advantage of her kindness."
depression,fj5niec,t3_fbi5mw,1583037274.0,"I remember the first time I self-harmed. I just remember looking at the cuts and being so scared and sad that I'd reached the point where I would willingly harm myself.
