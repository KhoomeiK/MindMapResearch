depression,fd6ca00,t3_ek3uky,1578188776.0,"look man, i feel your pain, i can understand mostly what you're going through and most of the cliches like she didn't deserve you and she'll understand how bad of a person she is eventually but right now the best thing you can do is work on yourself. don't get consumed with how she made/makes you feel because that leaves the potential to go down a very dark path. let yourself get consumed with finding happiness within yourself. Look for things that you find enjoyment in, try to develop healthy habits . I was in love with my very best friend since 6th grade, we started dating after her and one of my buddies helped me out and let me move in (thats a long story in itself but long story short my ""friend"" started dating her after i told her i loved her and when they split up, i drove her back to our home state and confessed my feelings for her and we started dating) we dated for almost 5 years and she was really the only girl i was 100% confident in trusting her that she wouldnt hide her feelings from me and wouldn't go behind my back. we had been having some problems because i was working a super physical job and working as much as i could to save up enough money to go on a vacation to the mountains and buy a ring to propose, but because my job was so physical and the hours i was working, when id get home id be completely exhausted and couldnt find the energy to really go out and do things. well one evening after a nap, she came into the bedroom and told me she wanted some time apart. Figuring she wanted space, i left to go to a mutual friends house and when i came back the next morning, the house was empty and she was moving into a dudes house that she worked with which to my understanding that relationship was innocuous . so we were the best of friends, the type of friendship that we could talk about anything and would be there for each other anytime anywhere for close to 8 years, and then dated for nearly 5 and it all ended in what seemed like a blink of eye in 1 night. 4 months after she split, she got engaged to that guy and has completely cut me out of her life. couldn't even get her to come sign a paper to get her name off the property. so like i said, take time to feel and process the feelings you're having but be conscious that things will get better eventually, you start to normalize the situation and learn to live again. Make it a point to force yourself to get out, even its for a little bit and walk around some nature. Try to pick up some old hobbies and try new things no matter how pointless or silly they might seem. take up writing, even if its just you writing out your thoughts and feelings, try working out to help with some confidence because i know when i was in a similar situation, i lost interest in everything even things i had loved doing for a majority of my life but you have to force yourself to do things and let your mind focus completely on the task at hand. The one thing that helped me out tremendously  was reconnecting with an old friend and going to my local bar with him which is where 99% of my friends that i met through the years from skateboarding all hang out at but that was mostly because i had developed a pretty bad pain pill habit and was isolating myself for a long time and getting back out and socializing was a major change. I'm here if you ever want to talk man, you're never alone."
