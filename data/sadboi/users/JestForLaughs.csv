BipolarReddit,fp6qp02,t1_fp6n8p9,1588356935.0,"I think so but I‚Äôm not sure. I had a manic episode start up before titrating up and it‚Äôs still ongoing but not as bad as a normal manic episode would be without medication. So, a little progress!"
BipolarReddit,fp6ixzb,t3_gbjksk,1588353136.0,I did initially but it‚Äôs tapered down significantly after like two weeks. Now I just feel restless and jittery
BipolarReddit,fp6i8wr,t3_gbesha,1588352794.0,"It seemed to help level my moods, however, it gave me terrible brain fog and had to be taken off of it because I became so dumb it was affecting my schoolwork."
BipolarReddit,fp6hde0,t3_gbh6z1,1588352365.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. If you need anyone to vent to or need to get things on your chest, my messages are always open. Hopeful for healing in this hard time."
AskReddit,fp452hr,t3_gb33ag,1588291843.0,Children Of Men. It was a great book but it lacked the amount of excitement and thrill that was found in the movie. I found a lot of the book‚Äôs turning points to be lackluster
bipolar,fozvir0,t1_fozv1mu,1588197606.0,"Well, that‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs hard knowing what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt, especially in the midst of suffering. But there‚Äôs no way to know for sure if you guys could have something real there! I know I wish I was with someone who understood what it was like to have a mental illness."
bipolar,fozuric,t1_fozrw10,1588197222.0,I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs hard to feel like I add much of anything to anyone except boredom and pain. I‚Äôm sick of feeling like I‚Äôm useless
bipolar,fozukcn,t1_fozspqc,1588197122.0,Same! Except I‚Äôm in a relationship with them. What all makes you think you‚Äôd fuck up their life?
Charleston,fn3crhd,t1_fn38001,1586618028.0,Thank you
BipolarReddit,fn0t1h9,t3_fygyah,1586548187.0,Happy birthday!!! Congrats on hitting 25 and to many more ‚ú®
BipolarReddit,fke9q8b,t1_fkdd8i2,1584108538.0,"It‚Äôs the most difficult, contradictory illness ever. You go from the deepest low to immediately a big high. I‚Äôm frustrated but better now. I appreciate your time in this response and know that that support hit me in a newfound way. Thank you."
bipolar,fke99nr,t1_fkdmr2n,1584108242.0,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
BipolarReddit,fke995z,t1_fkds5t2,1584108233.0,I called a crisis line and talked to a friend last night and that settled me a fair amount. I‚Äôve been on a slew of anti-depressants that never worked for me so this may be it. I think my dog knew I wasn‚Äôt doing well last night and slept next to me the entire time even though she usually jumps off the bed. I really appreciate the time you put into your response and I‚Äôm taking it to heart. Can I send you a PM and discuss some of this a little further?
ketorecipes,f2rzw6f,t1_f2qqeoi,1570378044.0,"Ah yeah, that‚Äôs totally fair! My boyfriend is bulking and I‚Äôm at OMAD so it works for us to have such a calorie heavy meal. You‚Äôre absolutely right about macros though! Keto‚Äôs the easiest and hardest diet in the sense that it‚Äôs so easy to eat and stay full but hard because the foods we do eat can be so heavy in calories. It‚Äôs a tough balance but so worth it!"
ketorecipes,f2nkyud,t1_f2njp5j,1570317288.0,"Eh it‚Äôs a guesstimate haha I have a bad habit of just eyeballing when I cook. It was probably closer to 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup broth but it was all added at different times. If it looked like it was going to be too rich, I added more broth. I have OMAD and it was well within my macros! The gravy itself is good enough for like 4 servings if your conservative with it unless you‚Äôre like me and just dump half the pan onto the chicken üòÖ"
ketorecipes,f2n96f4,t3_ddtyqp,1570313440.0,"The chicken was about 4lbs. I put Cajun seasoning between the skin and muscle so I could roast the skin and make it as crispy as possible without compromising flavor! Avocado oil was rubbed all over the chicken and then baked at 425F for ~45 min with an extra 2 minutes under the broiler. 

Gravy: chopped mushrooms, saut√©ed until golden brown. Add 1/2 onion diced and 4 cloves garlic. Add herbs de Provence, salt, and pep. Slowly add 1/4 cup beef stock and simmer on medium until reduced. Add 3/4 cup heavy cream and let it reduce until nice and thicccc.

Cauliflower risotto came from [Chef Resha](https://carnaldish.com/recipes/creamy-cauliflower-risotto/) because it looked too good to not try it out myself. I used whatever herbs I had in my house and it‚Äôs bomb as hell."
Legitpiercing,ewmf6a4,t1_ewm6wv1,1565550168.0,Oh! My apologies. That isn‚Äôt a curved barbell ‚Äî I was just going by what I saw. I‚Äôm so sorry!
Legitpiercing,ewm4j6x,t1_ewlztvo,1565543028.0,"It‚Äôs most likely a curved barbell! And you could but it would most likely irritate the piercing further. Your piercing (where the jewelry is sitting) *is* in the piercing channel as it is because that is what formed as your piercing healed. 90 degree surface bars are the appropriate jewelry to use, however, your piercing is long healed so I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about pulling it or anything! Chances are it‚Äôll never close with how long you‚Äôve had it."
Legitpiercing,ewlvsu6,t1_ewlszrj,1565537160.0,"Is it shaped like an L? APP studios should have a wide selection of ends and curved barbells that would suit your needs! Although we tend to switch not-optimal jewelry to the proper jewelry, that wouldn‚Äôt really be feasible here because that piercing channel (fistula) is so well formed to that jewelry that a 90 degree surface bar wouldn‚Äôt be successful even with it being 12 years old."
BipolarReddit,ewc6a9w,t1_ewa6a5a,1565278929.0,It makes it so hard with my friendships and relationships because a lot of people don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to feel that day and I really wish I could give them a consistent version of myself. Thank you for the support though! I hope you feel better soon as well ‚ù§Ô∏è
BipolarReddit,ewc64w3,t1_ewa3a39,1565278845.0,It‚Äôs so exhausting. It‚Äôs like being stuck in a revolving door.
BipolarReddit,ewc63op,t1_ewa4pf8,1565278826.0,Go to therapy and hope we survive?? Lol
Legitpiercing,ew5s4so,t3_cmwmpb,1565143731.0,Switch to a stud. The diameter is small enough where your body is irritated enough to heal the piercing so much that it created the bump. Warm saline compresses once a day and a stud with a labret should mitigate the issues!
NoStupidQuestions,evx6iez,t1_evx1lyx,1564883267.0,Ohhh gotcha! Thanks for the info!
NoStupidQuestions,evx1h2a,t1_evwy1sh,1564879220.0,"Yeah, but some people like to lie about drug use so I was just curious. Thanks!"
BipolarReddit,evsmlff,t1_evshomf,1564750958.0,"I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm on the right meds. I haven‚Äôt been properly medicated for the past two years and have only now been on something outside of Zoloft. My first psychiatrist would change my med cocktail almost every time we‚Äôd meet so I can‚Äôt remember if something did or didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm going to ask if I can get a new therapist because her adhd is driving me up the walls. Anyways, how do you let people in? I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to do that. Each person in my life knows a drastically different ‚Äòme‚Äô because I keep so much tucked away."
BipolarReddit,evry5t3,t1_evry3kn,1564722357.0,"Well yes, I just mean a reason outside of an obligation if that makes sense."
BipolarReddit,evry0s7,t1_evrxvav,1564722216.0,"It just goes back and forth and I can‚Äôt feel confident in being alive or dead. Regardless, I hope you can find a reason to stay alive that isn‚Äôt an obligation."
piercing,es4fj86,t1_es4f29k,1561583685.0,Thanks! And it‚Äôs a ball on the back. I prefer disks but we didn‚Äôt have any in stock ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è two bvla ends on a single piece of jewelry is just the right amount of glamour i hope to have in my own ear someday hahaha
piercing,es2apqp,t1_es2aml2,1561518532.0,Isn‚Äôt it so cute??! I have one in my conch too and it‚Äôs a fav
Legitpiercing,es27yz2,t1_es26xrk,1561516343.0,Probably either Noah Babcock or Thomas at Aesthetic Ambition
Legitpiercing,eqkz4h1,t3_bys48e,1560134081.0,"SC piercer here! Going along with what the other commenter said, this kind of custom bent industrial is also very anatomy specific. If you need some help feel free to DM me for any questions you may have in finding a piercer near you that may be able to assist in your goals."
