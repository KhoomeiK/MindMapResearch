From my standpoint (as someone in HR and Payroll) first off, that raise needs to be documented or it didn‚Äôt happen, and second, even if your manager did put it through, depending on how much the raise was for it could need to go to senior levels of your department/company and/or to HR for approval. 

Unless someone tells you a specific date that the increase goes into affect, there‚Äôs no reason to start raising hell because there are always approvals for this sort of thing before that change even gets to payroll. 

Have a chat with your manager about the issue, and if there is anything you can do on your part to help the process. Also ask when the effective date will be of that change in pay. If the raise actually SHOULD have gone into effect previously (which I doubt because nothing was in writing), then Payroll can retro that change later so you can still receive that pay from the previous month at the new rate."

I don‚Äôt know what she expected from me since she changed her mind every half an hour. She gave me no indication that that was how she felt, and it took me a long time to feel ok about myself again, and to realize that I was unfortunately in a toxic environment with a manager who wasn‚Äôt very skilled at managing and coaching her subordinates. 

I‚Äôm glad I found that evaluation though because I knew what I didn‚Äôt want in a manager or an organization, and I‚Äôm now working for a great company where my manager and peers appreciate what I do and communicate effectively."

If a viewer notices it, I guarantee you there‚Äôs a 99.9% chance that the youtuber is already aware of it and has tried to fix it. I don‚Äôt watch beauty youtubers to see absolute perfection, I watch them to see someone that I can relate to that shares a love for makeup, no matter what ‚Äúflaws‚Äù they have."

Pumping the breaks gives you more traction so that you don‚Äôt skid or fishtail. Also go 5-10 miles or more under what you normally go, especially on hills. People are more forgiving to people going slower when the whether is like this because everyone should be going slower.

My company is mid-sized (1,300-1,500 employees) so there‚Äôs around 20 people getting service awards every month, but having it just be one thing makes it so much more streamlined.

AskHR,f607j5l,t1_f5zoq1c,1572608628.0,"I work in HR and I can confirm it‚Äôs incredibly busy 99% of the time for a majority of us. Especially on Halloween when things are distracting and people leave early to trick or treat with their kids, etc. Everyone that emails us assumes they are our top priority, whether they are a new employee or current employee, so we have about 10+ people at a time vying for our attention on top of our normal duties that have a specific timeframe. I guarantee no one is ghosting this person on purpose. 

I would only consider it ghosting if no one responded to them for 5+ days. Which in that case, pick up the phone and call them."

I know you said his job is very mentally draining, but if he went to bed at a normal time, then there‚Äôs no reason why he would be waking up at 2 pm unless maybe he had some sort of underlying condition. 

He should see a doctor about it, and either way needs to help around the house. It‚Äôs not fair that you have to carry that burden by yourself."

humanresources,f39xwwr,t1_f397ipt,1570757819.0,"Actually in the USCIS website in the ‚ÄúCorrecting Form I-9 section‚Äù, they specifically mention that you should not backdate the forms. You have to go and correct them all and then attach a memo of what happened. Backdating the form is seen as trying to hide the error, when you should own up to it, but have it corrected. So you‚Äôre correct that they will need to get physical copies completed properly for each form that was shredded (I feel for the person who has to tackle that, even if it‚Äôs a small company), but you have to put the current date nonetheless. 

Also the Form I-9 has nothing to do with HIPAA."

If any recruiter does that i can guarantee that they will not respect you anymore as an employee, and you‚Äôre much better without them. Also blast them on Glassdoor so that others can be warned. 

I got lucky and work for a great company where we have a streamlined recruiting process and we aren‚Äôt so big that we can‚Äôt handle the amount of applicants.

Maybe that will give them enough bad press to avoid doing that to someone in the future and make them think about changing their policies. 

At every place I‚Äôve worked bereavement is ALWAYS separate time off. The length of time depends on your relationship with that person (spouse or child = most PTO) but it‚Äôs always separate because it‚Äôs seen as a once in a blue moon type thing, and it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed to help the employee mourn."
