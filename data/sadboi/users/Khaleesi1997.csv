From my standpoint (as someone in HR and Payroll) first off, that raise needs to be documented or it didn’t happen, and second, even if your manager did put it through, depending on how much the raise was for it could need to go to senior levels of your department/company and/or to HR for approval. 

Unless someone tells you a specific date that the increase goes into affect, there’s no reason to start raising hell because there are always approvals for this sort of thing before that change even gets to payroll. 

Have a chat with your manager about the issue, and if there is anything you can do on your part to help the process. Also ask when the effective date will be of that change in pay. If the raise actually SHOULD have gone into effect previously (which I doubt because nothing was in writing), then Payroll can retro that change later so you can still receive that pay from the previous month at the new rate."

I like her videos and everything, but then she does something like this where her attitude is just awful, or the Petty Paige incident which still bothers me, and it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth to where I really would rather support other creators."
grandrapids,f78z1ed,t1_f78kw1i,1573500346.0,"Pump those fucking breaks. You aren’t going to be able to break like you used to anymore. Pumping the breaks gives you more traction so that you don’t skid or fishtail. Also go 5-10 miles or more under what you normally go, especially on hills. People are more forgiving to people going slower when the whether is like this because everyone should be going slower. 

Sincerely, 
Someone who survived driving through the polar vortex of 2019."

humanresources,f71y3fj,t1_f71xkcu,1573350324.0,"That sounds very frustrating. My company is mid-sized (1,300-1,500 employees) so there’s around 20 people getting service awards every month, but having it just be one thing makes it so much more streamlined. I’ve never seen complaints from employees cause they can later spend the gift card on whatever they want."
humanresources,f71vzrt,t1_f71kki2,1573349319.0,"So your company only does service awards once a year? Mine does them every month to people who have certain anniversaries like their 1st or 5th year with the company, and we just use Visa gift cards. It is a little time consuming, but it’s a lot more standardized with just giving them one gift card."

AskHR,f607j5l,t1_f5zoq1c,1572608628.0,"I work in HR and I can confirm it’s incredibly busy 99% of the time for a majority of us. Especially on Halloween when things are distracting and people leave early to trick or treat with their kids, etc. Everyone that emails us assumes they are our top priority, whether they are a new employee or current employee, so we have about 10+ people at a time vying for our attention on top of our normal duties that have a specific timeframe. I guarantee no one is ghosting this person on purpose. 

I would only consider it ghosting if no one responded to them for 5+ days. Which in that case, pick up the phone and call them."
AskHR,f4rbmni,t3_dlid78,1571765416.0,"Big nope. I would be very weary of this company and what they’re intentions are. My guess is they’re either very ignorant, or are purposefully trying to discriminate against employees that are working with a green card, or an employment authorization card."
grandrapids,f4m75bo,t3_dl17es,1571675169.0,And I hope they get at least 25-life for it. It makes me mad how selfish some people can be. Nothing is worth another persons life. Now the lives of their son and the people that care about them are torn apart because someone wanted to get somewhere faster. It’s BS. Slow down and follow the damn law.
AmItheAsshole,f3sk169,t3_dhrdr0,1571104099.0,"NTA. Has he been seen by a doctor for how much he sleeps? I know you said his job is very mentally draining, but if he went to bed at a normal time, then there’s no reason why he would be waking up at 2 pm unless maybe he had some sort of underlying condition. 

He should see a doctor about it, and either way needs to help around the house. It’s not fair that you have to carry that burden by yourself."
AmItheAsshole,f3sj34j,t1_f3qosug,1571103658.0,"A couple of friends of mine had parents say stuff like this to them about not eating this and not eating that.

They are better now with help through therapy, but they talk about what their teen years would have been if their parents had encouraged them to eat healthy instead of just not eating at all."
rant,f3sg4tk,t1_f3pc96w,1571102292.0,"Ding ding ding, you are correct 😂. Literally one weekend my boyfriend and I were at a park, and some old couple began talking to us and asked us if we had “found a church yet” and just kept going on and on about how they love this area because of how “god loving” everyone was. The look they gave us when I said not only were we not looking for a church, but that we were living together before marriage, was priceless."
AskWomen,f3sffkr,t3_dhuu4j,1571101966.0,"That not having sex all the time is ok, especially if you’ve been with your bf nearly 2 years. One friend in particular doesn’t seem to understand this, which I think is because the longest she’s been with someone is half a year. That’s not a negative on her part, but it feels like she thinks less of my relationship because my bf and I aren’t crawling all over each other all the time. Sex is only a very small part of a lasting relationship, and there are other things him and I enjoy doing together besides sex."

rant,f3ntl1b,t1_f3mhwsz,1571002213.0,"I went to a much more liberal Methodist church, and my parents are very pro-choice and pro rights for LGBTQ people, but when I moved away from home at 18, I ended up moving to an area of our state (Michigan) that is known for being the “Bible Belt” of the state. There’s probably a church every half a mile in any direction you go. I never minded going to church growing up because of how open minded everything was, but unfortunately I don’t think I’ll find one like that over on this side of the state, so I just don’t go anymore unless I’m home for the weekend. 

Idk why more liberal churches that preach caring and loving instead of hating select groups of people are so rare these days."

AskHR,f3drt6i,t1_f3bvspx,1570845172.0,Are you seriously saying that companies need a “when to get coffee” policy in their employee handbook? Should there also be a “when employees can use the bathroom” policy?
humanresources,f39xwwr,t1_f397ipt,1570757819.0,"Actually in the USCIS website in the “Correcting Form I-9 section”, they specifically mention that you should not backdate the forms. You have to go and correct them all and then attach a memo of what happened. Backdating the form is seen as trying to hide the error, when you should own up to it, but have it corrected. So you’re correct that they will need to get physical copies completed properly for each form that was shredded (I feel for the person who has to tackle that, even if it’s a small company), but you have to put the current date nonetheless. 

Also the Form I-9 has nothing to do with HIPAA."
humanresources,f39id8w,t3_dg3al3,1570748515.0,"BIG NOPE. E-Verify is NOT an electronic method of storing the the forms, it’s just a way for the government to verify the employees eligibility. If she’s been doing that for all company I-9s...be prepared for a hefty fine if your forms are audited."

recruitinghell,f2u5eln,t3_de7ja8,1570407798.0,"I’m not a recruiter but I work in HR and recruiting is a very small part of my responsibilities (I help out for the roles with a large number of applicants). That being said though there’s no excuse for ghosting candidates or being assholes to them (ex: being discriminatory, posting ridiculous job descriptions, or showing common human decency to them). If any recruiter does that i can guarantee that they will not respect you anymore as an employee, and you’re much better without them. Also blast them on Glassdoor so that others can be warned. 

I got lucky and work for a great company where we have a streamlined recruiting process and we aren’t so big that we can’t handle the amount of applicants. To the recruiters saying they’re short staffed: HIRE SOMEONE TO HELP. You were once a candidate too. Treat others how you would want to be treated."
AskHR,f2lawfr,t1_f2h6vwp,1570293369.0,"YES YES YES. I second this idea. Light a fire under them (so to speak) for doing this to you because it’s ridiculous and they should be ashamed. Maybe that will give them enough bad press to avoid doing that to someone in the future and make them think about changing their policies. 

At every place I’ve worked bereavement is ALWAYS separate time off. The length of time depends on your relationship with that person (spouse or child = most PTO) but it’s always separate because it’s seen as a once in a blue moon type thing, and it’s what’s needed to help the employee mourn."
