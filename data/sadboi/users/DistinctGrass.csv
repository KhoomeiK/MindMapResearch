CPTSD,eutxyat,t1_eusowel,1564033629.0,"The way to triumph any abuser is to intentionally do exactly what they don't want you to do.

I am making it a habitual response to any idiot who tries to manipulate me. I'll agree with any failed attempt of their manipulation enthusiastically, then do the exact opposite every time."
CPTSD,eutwaje,t3_chhupu,1564032852.0,"I hate traveling because it is 90% of uncomfortable bullshit and hassle with huge unnecessary expenses for 10% time of very meh experience. I have never in my life been anywhere which was worth all suffering that came along with it.

And I'll never give half a fuck what idiots say about traveling, if they're so dumb to allow themselves to be manipulated out of their money and energy like that, they're not someone who is intelligent enough I'd want to even associate with."
CPTSD,euttyoq,t1_eurey7j,1564031701.0,I stopped questioning my negative beliefs when I simply left all females in my life to be themselves and prove their real nature without judgement. It proved to be way worse than my beliefs.

NPD,etl8zlp,t3_cbqlmm,1562927636.0,"Rejection is the biggest NPD trigger of them all. You need to vent your anger in small bursts and never keep a lot of it hidden for long time.

You need this security buffer for triggering events like one described. This way you'd still get triggered but it escalates more slowly, so you can remove yourself from triggering situation and cool down in private without exploding at once or lashing out."

Look at it like depression, you feel horrible at the moment, a week later you can't even remember how it felt. So is life horrible now and great a week later?

No. It is always average. On average. Emotions are fleeting and just make it feel different from the average reality for a short while."

NPD,et16jr2,t3_c9ipia,1562392560.0,"Never tell. It is just another excuse for them to abuse when they're looking for reasons to destroy your happiness by ruining the relationship.

They'll find plenty of excuses on their own, and if they don't leave, this means by definition that they do not mind your personality and accept you as you are.

You think your girlfriends felt bad about lying that they actually had 30+ sexual partners from whoring out on vacations, not just 2 from ex relationships? No, for them is normal to be evil and lie all the time when it is convenient for them."

You need to get a back up supply ready when primary supply is not totally used up. It is a lot easier to do that when not depressed but can be reached eventually.

As you are depressed now this indicates your supply has gone to shit and needs to get replaced asap.

I have never recovered from depression caused by primary supply using the same primary supply. It was always a replacement source."
NPD,esr6quq,t3_c8p0ks,1562217849.0,"First step is to silence the negative self talk, this just fans the flames making you spiral downwards until you act out on it which, as you already know, spells disaster.

Instead focus on your splitting as an reaction to the injury and think about what good parts of that person are your feelings now ignoring due to splitting.

Then take it as a learning opportunity, what part of your life should get blocked off from that person, to prevent further injury.

I know from experience it is a lot easier to replace people in life than to convince them to stop injuring you (impossible)."
