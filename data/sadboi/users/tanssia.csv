WritingPrompts,fn9b6je,t3_g06os3,1586766126.0,"It wasn't a particularly hard decision, but he had this debate every single time he came here. It wasn't often that he bought sweets since his newly diagnosis of prediabetes but it had been a particularly draining day at work and food had always been his comfort. 

*Chocolate chip cookie dough or cookies and creme?* 

He ended up just picking up both of them. He did get paid this week after all. He stuffed his purchases into his basket and turned to go towards the self-checkout. A man rushed past him and knocked him into the shelf. 

He was barely able to keep his items in his basket but his shoulder was smarting quite a bit. Whirling his head to glare at the rude person, he was met with terrified eyes. 

""Ah, be careful next time?"" slipped out of his mouth as he had never seen a man look so terrified in his life. A rude comment was really what he was about to spout, but seeing the man's eyes he bit back his curses. 

""Run, don't let them catch you,"" the man raspily whispered before running towards the bright red exit sign. 

Karl was confused as if the man just spoke Greek. *What the hell?* 

This is why he didn't dabble too much in drugs. That was a time in his life he did not want to go back towards. After successfully wasting his 20s in a drug induced zombie walk of life, he finally got his life together two years ago when he got clean. 

He shook his head. He didn't know the man's circumstances. Who was he to judge anyone. 

Shaking off the odd man's appearance, he made his way to the check out. 

He didn't get to finish checking out. 

Screams filled the air. He could hear people yelling. 

""Somebody help!"" ""Call 911?!"" ""What the hell are they?"" ""Run!!""

The woman next to him was attacked before the screams could even got out of her throat. All he could hear was the gurgling of blood. 

That was enough for him. He hightailed it out of there leaving his groceries next to the fallen woman. 

It wasn't only when he got to the parking lot that his brain was able to make sense of what just happened. 

*This wasn't a fucking movie. Why the fuck was that man eating that woman's head?*"
WritingPrompts,fn995ky,t3_fzyz3s,1586763897.0,"It was just an offhand comment that one of her teammates had made when they were doing a quest years ago. But the comment had changed her life. 

""You know, if you used that anxiety you have on other people, you'd have a hell of a destructive power."" 

In her own life, her anxiety was debilitating. It made her afraid to step out of her house. It made her question everything that she was doing. It made her unable to make the relationships she wanted. When she realized that she actually was able to harness that power and direct it onto other people. It was...frightening. To be honest, the first time she used it, the person ended up in an institute. As far as she knew, he was still there. She visited him about once a week. She apologized. But, it was like the words couldn't get through. And she knew, it wasn't enough. 

This was different though. There was an evil that was spreading around the world, and it was spreading rapidly. The powers that be had posted about building a team of people. The so called call for heroes. 

She wasn't a hero. She had never wanted to be a hero. 

But this was personal. 

This 'evil' whoever it was, had taken people from her. She wasn't a social person so she didn't have a lot of people. But she had parents. And now she didn't. 

""Number 11?""

She took a deep breathe before opening up the gates in front of her. There in front of her were four people in chairs. She didn't recognize them, but she had no doubt they were the powerful people. She wondered for a moment if she should have been a more avid watcher of the news. 

""Please, take a seat."" 

She sat down, trying to appear calm, even though her mind was a mess. 

""So, Kelli, what power would you have that would help us?""

She took another deep breathe even though her mind chanted that they would laugh at her. 

""Anxiety.""

The room was silent for a minute as she saw the people glance at each other and share raised eyebrows, before the man on the end erupted in raucous laughter. 

She cringed as her mind screamed, 'I told you they would laugh at you, like they always do'. 

Before too long, the other three were also laughing, but she just solemnly stared at them, waiting for them to finish. 

""...wait...you can't be serious?"" The man that had laughed first questioned as he saw she wasn't laughing. 

""This is ridiculous. We're trying to save the world, not be your therapist. We're looking for actual powers like invisibility or super strength, not *anxiety.""* The man with a mustache spouted. 

""This is not a joke, young lady. We don't have a lot of time and you are wasting ours with your prank."" The man with glasses rebuked. 

It wasn't anything she didn't expect. So she did eeny miny moe, and she felt sorry for the man with the glasses, but she concentrated on him, and she let go of the stream of thoughts. 

For a moment, her mind had clarity as she saw his face pucker up in a series of emotions. 

""Stop!"" The man screamed as he clutched his head. 

The other three men stared at the glasses man with confusion. 

The glasses man stared at her with pleading eyes, his lips mumbling words too quiet for her to pick up. 

She shook her head. ""I...I can't make it stop. It never ends. I wasn't planning on using it on any of you guys, but you weren't taking me seriously.""

""What did you do to him?"" The mustache man accused? 

""Anxiety."" She quietly whispered. 

*You're terrible, h*er mind whispered back."

WritingPrompts,fbd4fqt,t3_ece8x8,1576746221.0,"""God *damn* it, Ian! I told you that you dont have to *actually* cut me in half! Cheryl screeched as she felt the skin pull itself together by an invisible thread. No matter how many times she went through it, it was still uncomfortable every time. Not painful uncomfortable but uncomfortable like someone tickling her against her will. But less funny. 

When she had applied for this job, she wasn't expecting to actually be a real magician's assistance. She didnt believe in magic. It wasn't real. It was just trickery, slight of hands, and distractions. 

Or so she thought. Until she met Ian. 

""But, cheryl, where is the magic in that?"" Ian soothed while using his magic to pack up. All the props sorted themselves neatly into the boxes. It was pretty convenient considering how many props they used. 

All he had to do was wave his hand and it was done. 

""Look. We've gone over this before. No one has to know that you're an actual magician they just have to believe that you are. I can guarantee you that you're probably the only real magician in this whole country probably the whole world. Would it kill you to lie to people??""

Ian had told her about his magic right off the bat. She didn't believe him being the skeptic that she was but he sure proved her wrong. Time and time again did he prove her wrong. Apparently magic has been in Ian's family for centuries but throughout the years they had lost touch with that part of the world and slowly the magic disappeared. Until Ian. 

""Oh Cheryl. Who hurt you?""

She glared at him. This was the millionth time they had this discussion. When she first realized that Ian was the real deal it was amazing. In fact it was mind blowing to believe that magic really existed. 

But now. Now, she was just sick of being the guinea pig. 

""You know...you have all these amazing abilities including being able to heal me after I've been cut in half and you dont want to do anything else with your life? Like a doctor or something?""

""But that's so *boring*.""

Cheryl rolled her eyes. 

""Alright. How about next time we do a different trick where it's not me getting hurt. Let's do that Houdini one where you're all cuffed inside water and you need to escape. You can just use your teleportation magic. And all I have to do is stand there and look pretty."" 

The thread on her stomach stopped moving and she could feel the pricks of pain coming back. 

""Alright! Alright! Do whatever you want you damned magician."""
WritingPrompts,fb9v3rb,t3_eba4t3,1576651048.0,"""Cupid, would you shoot the target for once?!"" Her supervisor shot her a death glare as he picked out an arrow from a nearby tree. When she first was assigned a supervisor she had honestly been scared to death of his well, death glares, but the man was all talk. He was actually just looking out for here. They had a certain quota that they needed to get every day but ever since she had been assigned to this section, they've consistently been behind. It was one thing when it was just her getting in trouble, but now her supervisor also got yelled at. 

She tried to align the arrow into her bow and each target was marked with well a target above their head, but she had never really been good at shooting. Her mother was unfortunately absent from her life, so her father had taught her everything she knew. Which to be honest, would be a lot, in theory. She could calculate the angle, setup the trajectory, but for some reason, her body just would not cooperate. It was like she was cursed. 

She would try to shoot the target, but for some reason, the arrow would land on the person next to them. And inevitably, she would end up creating a love triangle. It got so bad one time, that she had just taken the arrow and tried to jab the guy instead of using her bow, but that definitely didn't work out. Because apparently when you do that, the bow is actually a sealer for the power of the arrow and by lifting up the seal, the arrow's powers were basically shooting everywhere.

That day, everyone loved everyone. Thus everyone hated everyone. It was a catastrophe. 

It was a moment that she was not proud of but remembered as a lesson. Mistakes were opportunities to learn was what her dad taught her. 

""Ah cupid! How? How did you miss???? I even held him in front of you. We even used Hell's ice to freeze the man's time for a minute! Hell will kill us once he finds out that we used his stuff again! But I'm probably going to die before then from stress. Look I'm gonna show you one more time. You put the arrow here, aim, and then fire!"" Pysche demonstrated while yelling. 

Cupid's eyebrows furrowed, there was something off about the way that he was holding it. Just before he took the shot, she figured it out. The arrow was the one that was used for immortals! How did that even get here??? Her hand shot out to divert it, but she ended up stabbing herself with it instead. And when she took the arrow out of her hand, it ended up stabbing Psyche, her supervisor. Because, *of course*, that would be her luck. The arrows never worked on Cupid because well that was her power, but Psyche, even though he was assigned to this division. He was just a typical immortal. 

""Hey! why did you-"" The effect was pretty immediate. 

""Cupid...have you always looked so...radiant?""

*oh for the love of gods*. Cupid thought as she saw the pretty little hearts start forming around Psyche's head. Her clumsiness had outdone itself again."
WritingPrompts,fb56re3,t3_ebbhfm,1576522039.0,"It was inevitable. Everyone died. It was a fact of life, and after fighting with the cancer for years, she figured it was time to let go. 

It was a good fight but, it was exhausting. It was absolutely thrilling the first time she beat cancer; the celebration consisted of too many drinks and substances that probably trashed her body more than she meant to. But she had beat cancer; it was a moment worth celebrating. Or so she had thought. 

When Karie got the news that the cancer had returned, she plummeted into probably the darkest moment of her life; even darker than when she got her initial diagnosis. She was only able to be pulled from that abyss with the help of her family and fiancee. And some medications. And her therapist. 

The second time she beat cancer, it was like: did she really beat it? Her loved ones said that since she beat it a second time that she was a hero. And she believed it for a moment. Until that moment collapsed and she was sitting in front of her oncology doctor who had that incredibly familiar face of regret.  She didn't even have tears at the news of the cancer's return. It was like all the emotion and sadness were gone. She should have expected this. Why did she even hope?

It was back. And this time it was stronger. The medications this time made her sicker; the treatment was longer. The pain was more consuming. This time she didn't do well at all. She lashed out. She had mood swings. She lost her hair. She lost weight. She seemed to lose a part of her trying to get rid of the parasite. She regretted the second fight. She regretted fighting at all. But, most of all, she regretted the hope. The hope made her believe and the failed expectation was more painful than anything the cancer could inflict. 

So, she signed the papers. She gave copies to her family and to her fiancee. Her family threw it back at her saying that she was making a mistake and that they wouldn't let her. Her fiancee cried for the first time since they started dating. She wanted to hug him. But it felt like if she did, it was like her saying that she didn't mean it. So she left him there crying. The next day he made breakfast for her and they talked. He said he would be there with her to the end. That's when the floodgates opened. And she cried. Not just little tears. But she ended up bawling to the point that her throat was hoarse and her eyes hurt and her heart ached. 

She didn't want heroic measures; she just wanted to go. It had been a long life. It had been a good life. And she was ready.

Or at least that's what she thought. 

She closed her eyes one night after a specifically horrible night filled with nausea, tears, and pain and woke up next to her body. 

She was dead. She knew it instantly. 

Was this what ghosts were? Was this why they couldn't pass on? Was this why they existed? 

Because of such a silly reason as Death couldn't see them????? 

This brought a whole new meaning to being invisible in a conversation. 

It was ridiculous, but it was a truth that was hard to deny. Especially considering she was standing right in front of Death in a terribly too personal way. Like, if she stuck out her tongue, she could accidentally end up frenching Death. She even tried screaming right in Death's ear. She screamed until even she got tired of hearing her own voice. 

She knew it was Death because history didn't get her wrong in that she was cloaked in all black. Death didn't carry a scythe, but instead a little jar. She seemed to be going around the hospital and collecting what Karie assumed were souls. They would just be sucked into into the little jar as the familiar flat line appeared on the heart monitors. It looked like it was a busy day for death, but what did she expect this was the hospice wing. 

Maybe this was god's way of saying, sorry about your death, let's continue in the sequel: the afterlife. 

Either way, it looks like it wasn't the end."
