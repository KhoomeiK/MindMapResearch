I do agree goodwill has been getting more greedy, and is making me think twice about my purchases there.

It‚Äôs not a higher end model, it looks to be a basic model with just extra things. Yes I agree it was a good price, but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way knowing they changed it once they realized what they had."

The thing is if any of our customer caught one of our mistakes, like labeling the wrong price, the store would own up to mistakes for the customer. If you‚Äôre a frequent GW, you tend to noticed the price hikes they‚Äôve been having. It‚Äôs just not a great feeling to think you got a great deal, only to see a price that‚Äôs half of what you paid was originally on there. 

Either way after much research on the internet chances are extremely low I will even get a cash refund. In the off chance they agree, only store credit would be offered. 

I don‚Äôt know, this just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."

I hardly ever splurge at GW, but I‚Äôve really been into bread making lately and could really use it right now.

Guys, I‚Äôm mad, hurt and upset that my local GW played me like this. 
Going tomorrow to see if there‚Äôs anything they can too.
