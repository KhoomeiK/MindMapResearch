abusesurvivors,fqq0nxp,t3_gka5ed,1589557373.0,"‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt let him make me feel this way.‚Äù 

He isn‚Äôt making you feel this way, this is your mind‚Äôs attempt to cope. You had trust ripped from you and it‚Äôs a grieving process. These feelings are yours, not something he did to you. Yes, it‚Äôs what he did that made you feel this way, but I think it‚Äôs good to be able to see and accept your feelings as your own. They are part of you, not some poison injected by the trauma he caused you. 

I‚Äôll recommend what anyone else would and say trying to start online/phone/video therapy during this time could be a good option. I started therapy with a local therapist over the phone and I‚Äôm moving to in-person when allowed. Have you told anyone close to you about this? I think it‚Äôs totally valid to reach out here. I know it hurts horribly to feel unable to tell someone who really knows you and/or the person who did this that it happened, but I also understand why it feels impossible and why there‚Äôs fear in trying to tell someone. 

If what you need to do is let yourself be down for the week/weekend, do that. Sometimes taking care of yourself is letting yourself lay with your cat in your onsie and do nothing for a few days. Have you written about this experience at all? I personally find journaling therapeutic, though it does cause me to overwhelm myself sometimes, it lets me get things out, even if I have to write about the same thing over and over again. Processing and healing isn‚Äôt a one-and-done deal. 

I cant be one to talk because I cant say I‚Äôve done a lot of healing myself, but I can say that I read every word of your post and my heart goes out to you."
COCSA,fqpz5bw,t1_fqpusjr,1589556610.0,"I also think it depends on ‚Äúhow far‚Äù it goes and how long it goes on. There‚Äôs a difference between exploring/poking around/touching and then recreating adult sex acts. I feel even if both children are technically ‚Äúconsenting‚Äù to each other they can still sort of peer pressure one another, which can be damaging to both. Really no matter what or where we try to draw the line there is going to be an exception. If it makes you uncomfortable looking back or you feel you were damaged by it, that‚Äôs valid. Either way as long as there isn‚Äôt an age difference/manipulation/coercion, it‚Äôs sort of a situation where both parties are ‚Äúguilty‚Äù and also essentially innocent. 

I would view it similar to when two adults end up having sex and then both regret and realize they were both uncomfortable or pushing themselves to be okay w it when they werent. It‚Äôs okay for both of them to experience negative feelings because of that mistake, but at the end of the day it wasn‚Äôt either of their faults. They both did it to themselves and each other, if that makes sense (only comparing that to ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù sexual interaction between two kids that goes too far and ends up hurting one or both of them)."

If it doesnt work, it most likely wouldn‚Äôt be anything to do with the fact you‚Äôre a singlet and they‚Äôre part of a system. As for your last question, it depends on the system. I refer to the system my parter is in as my ‚Äúpartner system‚Äù, and so I have a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with them as a whole system, but I‚Äôm only dating the host and one other in the system. 

If you did have a relationship with them, this is all something you can and absolutely should explicitly speak with the host and any others who may be involved about. Some questions would include: Is it okay to be in relationships with others in the system? Will others in the system have relationships with other singlets or systems, or will the system be monogamous with you (as in, anyone in the system who wants a relationship will have that with you or with someone within their own system, not anyone in any other body)? 

There‚Äôs a lot of extra questions and logistics like this that come with dating within a system, but try not to get too overwhelmed. It‚Äôs totally healthy and necessary to be able to have conversations about this. If you do end up dating their host, I‚Äôd have this conversation early on."

It‚Äôs good to know others also feel the tenseness and fear that comes alongside actually having your trauma validated - because being validated is great, but it also makes the problems more real. I hope this keeps going well for you all! Remember stirring things up always makes it harder to handle for a while.

You arent obligated to excuse or overlook anything your ex did/does just because she has BPD, and sometimes (I‚Äôm not saying this applies to her, but it may help) people are just hurtful and inconsiderate. Basically, there‚Äôs a line to draw between what is acceptable/excusable unpleasant BPD behavior and what is just downright shitty, manipulative, and abusive.

Personally this has given me some peace when thinking about my past relationships, so I hope it‚Äôs a useful thing for you as well.

I cant imagine that my body could physically contain my emotions: when I get angry it amazes me that my torso doesnt tear open like a dragon‚Äôs crawling out of me, and when I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm amazed I can stand or even move (and sometimes I cant - it feels like the weight of my emotions should be pushing me into the ground)."

What you‚Äôre describing sounds more like amnesia, which might indicate a full-on dissociative disorder like dissociative amnesia, Dissociative Identity Disorder(DID) or Otherwise Specified Dissociative Disorder(OSDD), IF you meant you dont remember how you get places at all. It‚Äôs blurry to tell the line between types of dissociation sometimes, but if you‚Äôre experiencing total amnesia - especially day to day or even just once a month - you might have something else playing along with BPD. Amnesia or total memory gaps and blackouts are definitely not part of BPD by itself.

COCSA,fpoyvle,t3_ged2cg,1588793030.0,"For people who‚Äôve been secually assaulted or experienced sexual abuse it‚Äôs very, very common to be either hypersexual or sex repulsed and hate everything to do with sex, intimacy, or physical contact, and it‚Äôs possible to be both as well, or to change between being hypersexual and sex repulsed, like it sounds like you‚Äôve described here. I hear a LOT from the community about having intrusive thoughts about their trauma, having issues with masturbating, and things like that.

therapy,fpmxmss,t1_fpmtn7a,1588744400.0,"I know a lot of my issues stem from things I learned and experienced as a kid. I‚Äôm aware enough to see my problems and their connections to my past, but I‚Äôve tried to take further steps (validating trauma, respecting myself, handling triggers without shutting down) and I haven‚Äôt been able to do that on my own. I get overwhelmed by my emotions, doubt, and images from my childhood that are triggered to drag me down when I try to confront those ingrained but unhealthy defense mechanisms. I need a therapist as a trained, trauma informed, grounding source of support to be able to do that work for myself.

So it‚Äôs not really just talking about my childhood. It‚Äôs everything else that comes with my childhood. Trying to teach myself that I didnt have to suffer. Trying to gain strength to cope. Trying to forgive myself for my own emotions and reactions. Coping with triggers, the thoughts and images and fear and insecurity that takes over regularly - I cant do that on my own. 

But I know many people who also experience trauma who never went to therapy, never really talked about it, and manage just fine finding satisfaction in their life. Yes they has issues as well, but theyve learned to manage on their own. I could do that. I could keep going how I‚Äôve been going. I just have the opportunity to make things better and I want to take that for myself. I dont want to just ‚Äúmanage‚Äù. I want to grow beyond that.

My biggest fear is that I am somehow manipulating even myself into having false triggers, faking symptoms for attention, lying to people to see like (like you said,) a ‚ÄúI have mental health problems pity me and take care of me‚Äù person. I also have thought about how it feels as if no one will believe I am struggling or listen to me unless I horribly damage myself, attempt suicide, or otherwise end up in the hospital. 

I also have gotten stuck on what I dont remember of my childhood, and again convinced myself I was making things up to victimize myself. I dont know how to stop doing that. It‚Äôs my biggest problem in the way of healing, for sure.

BPD,fp3cwu3,t3_gb2yrn,1588277123.0,"I think many therapists are afraid of that. I felt the same vibe from my last therapist as well. She may not want to label you because of the stigma around BPD, but if that is the case it would be better for her to bring it up with you and ask you if you want that as an official diagnosis/in your record or if you just want to know that you do or do not meet the criteria. Its extremely frustrating and it feels invalidating to be looking at the symptoms and seeing how you fit so clearly and then have someone act like there is no correct label. Sometimes there wont be, but when youre looking at a specific thing like BPD and youre nearly certain, it almost feels as if theyre saying your symptoms arent ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù to meet the criteria. 

Have you explained to her that you would really appreciate a specific diagnosis? Therapy doesnt have to be so secretive, though it does feel that way sometimes.

COCSA,fotqw1q,t3_g9dypo,1588062921.0,"These things are always more complicated when everyone involved is a child, but one thing I can say for sure is that you are not a monster. You were exposed to sexually inappropriate things and you were curious as any child would be. A lot of times in a kids mind they‚Äôre either re-enacting or they see sexual things as something that will make them older or cooler, which is very common when several kids are involved or when kids who are older than the others initiate the sexual things (like how your brother was older than you). Based on the way your brother reacted even as you got older, I think it‚Äôs safe to say he is an abuser even if the original incident with him happened when he was younger (12 is a very iffy spot). The blackmailing is a horrible thing to have experienced on top of the sexual things.

I want to make sure you know that if you feel this has caused you or anyone else involved trauma, it is 100% valid. If it hasn‚Äôt it is still 100% valid for it to make you feel uncomfortable or gross. Many times kids who have been abused in some way act on other children, and that is NOT that child‚Äôs fault. That is the fault of the person who abused them. Of course if they continue to do sexually inappropriate things with younger kids as they get older (into their teens) then it comes to them to get stop and get help. 

You seem very intelligent, well spoken, and introspective, and being introspective will help you so much as you continue to process what‚Äôs in your past. I recommend journaling if you can, because you can really get lost in writing and I find it a good way to let myself feel my emotions when things get too chaotic.

Not everyone can end up happy with the situation, but it helps to let them all speak and make sure you understand where their coming from.

The huge, dark, looming adult form that asserts denial, self hate, and punishment. The wounded child that comes out in my moments of panic and sudden vulnerability. The enraged, but some times fun to become (because rage is power to the abused) rebellious and overly cocky ‚ÄúI dont need anyone but myself‚Äù teen/young adult that hates everything and will cut me off from anyone when I‚Äôm under too much stress to avoid being hurt again.

BPD,fk0pgvl,t3_ffqk6k,1583763141.0,"Well sort of. As a quiet borderline myself I am very self aware, but I see it as leaning towards imploding as opposed to exploding or taking things out on others. I dont word things this way to shame anyone, I‚Äôm not sure how to word it to someone who isn‚Äôt quiet borderline in a way that isnt hurtful to people with BPD who are more prone to ‚Äúoutbursts‚Äù. Essentially, we all spiral and have dark thoughts and paranoia, but where some people will very often say things to others (like their FP) that are accidentally manipulative, or blatantly manipulative, or explode/go off to defend themselves, quiet borderlines sort of have an extra layer of shame and denial that stops them from acting out the behaviors we usually have the urges to do. Instead of ‚Äúgoing off‚Äù or blatantly manipulating someone, we may just go very quiet, distance ourselves, essentially ‚Äúabandon‚Äù the other person and isolate ourselves rather than fighting. I‚Äôve heard us referred to as Discouraged Borderlines as well, I believe. 

Basically our forms of shame, denial, self mistrust, and self hate just manifest in a way that causes us to be literally and figuratively quieter about our emotions/splitting/swings. However we can still be manipulative, and I know everyone with BPD who is aware is ashamed of doing it, yet it is the only way we see we can be heard/listened to. For example, I‚Äôll be passive aggressive with my FP in a way that feels out if my control. Rather than my Fight response being activated, most of the time my Flight or Freeze responses will be activated. Though I do still struggle with anger immensely, it is most often me refusing to speak to the person for a while, or perhaps speaking very shortly/bluntly in a way that confuses and concerns the person Im speaking to. I also often go into somewhat catatonic states, where inside Im spiraling but on the outside Im not moving, not responding, not looking the person in the eyes. It feels like I physically cannot make myself, like my shame is immobilizing me and also preventing me from hurting someone.

Sorry for the wall, and anyone feel free to add or correct me, but that‚Äôs my own experience/interpretation."

therapy,fjdu22x,t3_fcx251,1583259256.0,"As others have said, it‚Äôs unprofessional and inappropriate to make assumptions like that. I‚Äôm preparing to go into therapy some day and a huge thing we emphasize is being culturally open and dismantling stereotypes and assumptions we have of people from other backgrounds than us.

She may well be unaware of the bias she holds, which is NOT an excuse; however, if you visit a few more times and she lets it go and learns quickly, she may be an OK option for you. That being said, if she continues to try to assert that she knows what‚Äôs bothering you even when you correct her... not good. Thats when I would say definitely stop seeing her, because she isnt listening at that point. 

 I know how hard it is to find therapy, how hard it is to wait, and how much more difficult it must be when the therapist youve been waiting for makes assumptions like that. It‚Äôs very unfortunate that there‚Äôs no way to tell they‚Äôll be like that until you‚Äôve had a few sessions. It‚Äôs frustrating to have to keep waiting on the help you need, but a therapist who doesnt listen either wont help or will make things worse. I certainly hope she doesn‚Äôt end up being any more problematic.

I‚Äôm glad you seem to have a strong support system with your family and your religion! No matter what that is - if it helps support you, own it. And certainly dont let your therapist try to convince you your religion is what‚Äôs causing your problems. 

Best of luck!! üíê"
DID,fjd2j1t,t3_fcqm6f,1583244056.0,"Like u/T_G_A_H said, except I‚Äôll add that   since often the emotions have been deeply repressed or dissociated from oneself, you may not remember being upset /at the time/. The body may have been in panic mode and other emotions left for background processing later. This isnt all cases of course, a lot of times people will remember the feelings from the original events, but I wanted to point it out since that is what helped me realize I was having emotional flashbacks despite having no access to remembering feeling those feelings when I‚Äôm NOT having a flashback. If that makes sense üòÖ

They also may or may not be associated with a specific memory. It could be a build up of emotions from many events. I believe this occurs in Borderline Personality Disorder (which is being categorized as a subset of CPTSD in the DSM 6) as well. 

Edit: I realize the user I mentioned above actually said the thing about it not needing to be associated with a specific memory - sorry about that!

Hope this is helpful!"

Yet many professionals still assert that BPD happens in people who are ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù... Besides that, BPD has been classified as secondary structural dissociation, and categorizing it as going alongside CPTSD will make treatment plans for BPD more inclusive of the frequency of childhood trauma, perhaps including more trauma treatment rather than just focusing on making the person lessen symptoms without working so much on the internal systems that caused the reactions...
