Water_Fasting,fpxex8v,t3_gg475n,1588981364.0,"Im approaching my 4th day right now.
Just focus on how good you will feel when you reach day 28 and how you will regret it if you stop so early. I watch ASMR of people eating foods that I like on YouTube and that's how I survived my 21-day fast 3 years ago and it's still my strategy right now (idk, it helps suppress my own cravings for some reason). Drink plenty of fluids and keep yourself occupied with activities (my partner and I are marathoning Naruto atm lol) and if I wasn't watching anime rn I would be exploring an old/new talent or something of the sort. You can do it, it's all in your head."

I kept the abusive texts for when I am ready to talk and in case she denies ever being horrible to me.

Sorry for the spam, I don't see many Filipinos in this sub (fortunately, and unfortunately for the ones that miss out on this refuge) and I didn't realise how important this was to me because a lot of Filipinos just don't understand this and the gravity of narcissism. I know it sucks, but it's good to be away from it and that we have loving partners, right?

(PS you have also piqued my interest because your post history on fitness is admirable! I'm on the same boat and trying to lose weight and kinda struggling with the legs too, ugh)"
raisedbynarcissists,ey9g8x0,t3_cl627q,1566942653.0,"My partner is Italian and can be naturally loud too. I get micro-discomfort when his voice gets loud (without malice) and I have cowered in response a few times before and he was taken aback the first couple of times I responded negatively to it... My mom was always loud and tbh, loud things in general scare me too because my mom would throw tantrums around the house (slam doors, drop things, slam items onto the surface etc) when she doesn't get it her way :/"

Fellow Filipina ACoN here! I ran away from my parents last year for similar behaviour! It's a long journey but I left because they struggled to control my life (they hate the man I love) and my dad was giving me silent treatments while my mother compensated for that silence by verbal and physical abuse! Laban lang! ;p"
BPD,ey5pl8p,t3_cvkb29,1566837360.0,"Yeet, I needed this.

I haven't felt the urge in months and, just now, I was about to look at my partner's ex/ex-crushes' Instagram and Facebook profiles for no good reason. I just know it will trigger my insecurities (even though my partner gives me enough reassurance to last a non-BPD girl 47 lifetimes) and make me feel shit for things I have no control over at the moment.

Thank you so much."
relationships,ey5ozv9,t3_cvokq0,1566836962.0,"I was the girl in this situation. My controlling parents also put me in this situation and gave me an ultimatum. 

As a response, I left home, became homeless for 3 weeks (my boyfriend's friends gave me space to sleep in their places for 2 weeks, and my boyfriend accompanied me for one week during the nights I slept in public places) before I found a place of my own. My partner is the best person in my life, I wouldn't lose him for anything, especially to unreasonable adults.

Obviously can't expect anything as drastic like the above but if I couldn't leave home for a reason (financially dependent or whatever), I wouldn't expect my partner to hold on to a relationship like that.

She can't expect you to wait if you can't, and this situation wouldn't be fair to you at all."

I will spare the details but I am a born-again Christian (3.5 months now!) and Baptist, and also have been studying the Bible!

My best friend (who is like family to me) is homosexual and it would break my heart if anyone ever tries to use it against him.

For as long as your friend doesn't use your sexuality as a reason to treat you unfairly, she isn't TA. Similarly, you aren't TA either if this dynamic is making you uncomfortable to proceed. Maybe give each other some space if you are both willing to salvage the friendship? 

Please allow me to clarify to that sexualities and all of those other things are very secondary to true Christians. God asks of us to love our neighbors, without condition, as we love ourselves. The actions and choices of others is not for ours to judge."
AsianParentStories,exfud1a,t3_cshmx3,1566248563.0,"One of the many reasons I ran away from my APs (besides their being controlling and narcissistic) was to experience my love with my partner to the fullest extent.

I won't go into details but my APs got my partner kicked out of his own house (he lives with his uncle and aunt that he is not very close with) by smearing his name and I left because I felt betrayed by their actions (he is non-Asian and they didn't approve that either) and also because I wanted to support my partner (also my mom was being violent and pulling my hair all over my room while shouting about how I should have just dated an Asian boy, smfh)... it made me homeless for 3 weeks (he had another month in his house before he was kicked out) and he helped me find places to sleep (like at his friends') and, for a whole week, he kept me company and slept with me in public places even though he still had a bed to go to if he wanted it.

My partner and I have been through thick and thin and, even though growing up with my parents made me develop borderline personality disorder, my partner and I work actively towards me getting better from it and it's always been a matter of me & him vs the problem rather than it being me vs him. I learned what love truly was while being with him and we have been living together for more than a year now, and we just placed a holding deposit for our new apartment in the city. :) It has been an adventure and it's all just perfect. I owe it all to focusing on love."

Now, at 23, I like to keep it as a part of routine when I get ready because it's so nice and relaxing and I love how my eye makeup can be a part of my outfit. But now more than ever, at this age, I am my most comfortable in my own skin and I actually go out without makeup!! :)"
