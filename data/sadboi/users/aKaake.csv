TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fq61w9c,t3_gh11p8,1589122758.0,"I’m going to say the same thing everyone else is saying- you’ll meet someone who wants to be with you and treat you the way you deserve to be treated. 

My ex and I dated for almost four years, and in that time we broke up four times because he would say I deserved someone who would treat me the way I needed, and I would always go back. Before the last breakup he told me he wanted to be alone forever and thinks that he was meant to be alone. 

Three months later he was in dating apps and met someone, confessed his love to her, and now posts a bunch of shit on social media, which he never did with me. I get where you’re coming from, but, on the bright side- I’ve met someone who is a kind and amazing person, taking it slow and it’s awesome. 

Be patient! Things will fall into place :)"
dating_advice,fp4qd6f,t3_gb45pj,1588304813.0,Just have to be strait forward and ask. I’m too old for this shit. And dating during this time sucks big time! I literally FaceTime with my boyfriend every night and watch tv together since we can’t be next to each other because he’s an essential worker and still has to work.

Big thanks for people like him and everyone else in that situation 😊"

mentalhealth,fikh8rr,t3_f89un5,1582480304.0,"My ex boyfriend didn’t know how to handle it when I would have a panic attack and would tap my shoulder like he was petting a dog. Current boyfriend talked me through one while I was in the car and he was at home, then when he had to go (it was during the Super Bowl) he texted me a bunch of funny memes from the office to take my mind off of what was going on. 

Some people are just better in these kids of situations than others, and the people that are better in them, know that you’re appreciated:)"

Along with everyone else, take stool softeners and also when you get up, either just hold your belly or hold a pillow against it to make sure it doesn’t pull."

The only time there was an issuer was when he fell asleep with law and order on and it was a little loud so the neighbors left us a note asking to shut the tv off before bed. Other than that, no real issues!"

I’ve never seen the inside of the Riverwalk ones, but I’m sure they’re nice too. So it’s kind of a toss up. But my two cents to throw in would be the Mill :)"
