Their response to higher intensity exercise is a heck yes to swimming, and they really don't know where to put me at for other types that don't utilize water. Even some of thier low intensity exercises they had me try were making some symptoms worse so I couldn't do them. It's really hard because the leg issues are rare. Them and I have had to accept that because I've had to hold back on certain things, certain parts of my body have to pay for it too. Like less lower leg engagement means tighter hips, glute and calf deactivation. So, even though more walking and planter flexion would help in ways, it's contraindicated for my leg syndromes.  So some of it really is catch 22. Thier upper body exercises were really helping my range of motion, regain feeling, and reduce pain. Too soon to notice any strength gains. Unfortunately even with that, there's only so much my upper body can progress because the cervical fusion progressively limits me. The core work, doesn't mess with the cervical or leg issues so that has been well. But again, it's nothing truly high intensity high heart rate high calorie burning type. 

My leg syndromes, some that have it, can just stop running and they're great to do everything else with their legs... that's how it used to be for me. But me, like some, it gets progressively worse. It also didn't help that before I found out, I was making it worse running on it. Then after finding out, several failed  surgeries later, I've had to be on my feet just to work and survive. I can't lay down and sit all day. Yet I am more and more and I hate it."

Same thing when I was overworking on my legs at jobs which I have had to hold back on too. 

By the way, my calorie intake through diet was way higher, and more sugar and carbs and junk. 

I simply cannot exercise that way I used to. Not yet at least. Maybe when my legs get cured or if I found myself scrambling for an on the feet Job to survive I would at least be on my feet at work...

So confused."
vapehelp,fkxtv58,t3_flcdt4,1584635333.0,"I have pulled up and cleaned the seal and pin on the mod. I've set it higher up, tested it. As well as tested it set more down. 

Here's the whole story:

Kbox mini mod box found along with sub v coil/tank thing attached to it. Some juice was in it and I poured some more (I didn't overfill I don't think) and charged it. Didn't pay attention to any ohms or voltage readings. It would fire and pull some smoke but barely. 

I'm a newb so I didn't take care of this thing....
I figured this thing is kinda shit and didn't want to put money into it especially since I was still smoking tobacco at the time. I laid it sideways in a box for months WITH LIQUID IN IT AND LET THE BATTERY DRAIN BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHEN THE SCREEN GOES OFF IT AUTO TURNS OFF. Yes I was later told at the vape shop how to turn it on and off and to not leave liquid in... 

I took it out of the box months later, it turns on after charging. Doesn't fire. Then it's suddenly leaking juice bad. Paid no attention to the ohms and voltage reading (figured it was just magical rune speak).

I took it to a vape shop yesterday. Girl checked the battery, the mod pack, turned it on and off, unscrewed the coil/tank. Told me better ways to take care of it like proper cleaning and not leaving liquid in. She was pretty certain it just needed a new coil/tank setup. She showed me how to prime the new tank/coil setup I just bought from there. (Hawk by vaporstorm). 

My mistake, I didn't test the whole new setup before walking out... yes I'll probably be going back and begging for help soon.

I've been doing some researching online last night and today. It seems like I have a connection issue between the coil/tank pin and the box pin. 

Last night I have tested after pulling the box pin up and cleaning it further. As well as putting it back in further up. As well as putting it back in further down. I'm not sure if the seal is wrong in relation to the actual pin. Paid no attention to ohms and voltage readings during all this.

Then this morning I decided to lookup what the fuck are those readings....

9.9ohms 0.0voltage on old leaky tank/coil. 

0.0ohms and 0.0voltage with new one.

I have no clue what to do from here. What I can try before coming back to the vape shop with empty without blowing the thing up. 

Please speak in simple terms. I'm not well versed in vape world. I have very temporarily had a multi product pen (where you can switch the tank to burn dry, wax, or liquid) and a straight dry vape. Both I had given away years ago. 

Thank you."

loseit,fjleoxf,t1_fjh7zy4,1583445317.0,"I have burned, flushed, trashed and later when I realized I'm maybe giving nature some psycho food, dropped them off into med drop boxes. 

In my heart I want to say fuck it and not be dependent on it. (Hoping someday I don't have to take them). But also it's for safety so I don't swallow a bunch.

Prayers and good vibes on everyone's safety. They CAN be abused on purpose or fuck you up accidentally. Be careful."
