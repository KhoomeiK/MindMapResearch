depressed,foacdjw,t3_g6k3dd,1587644299.0,I would get a new therapist. I signed up for BetterHelp three weeks ago but I am also thinking of switching therapists.
SuicideWatch,fo33qmc,t3_g5ejp3,1587479979.0,"I feel the same way. People don’t give a fuck about what your going through, nor do they know what to say to even make you feel better about your situation. I started therapy 3 weeks ago and I feel like she judges me lowkey. I don’t even think it’s working. The expense on Better Help isn’t that bad. It’s $180 for one month. Not to bad....but a waste of money if this really doesn’t work. My question is if my therapist can’t even make me feel better or help me through this who can? Answer : Nobodyyyyyyyyyy"
