At the moment Sartre is the only author that I know well (I also know Plato quite well, but I don't like his philosophy), so you have to be patient and humble.

And forget about what you did at school, that isn't philosophy (from a student)."
Existentialism,fiqkjcv,t3_f9b9ak,1582646269.0,"The point is that many people confuse ""existentialism"" with ""existential"", so they think that this subreddit is for those who have existential crisis or something like that.

Existentialism,fia31ij,t3_f744h6,1582291641.0,"I understand your perspective, and first of all you're not saying nonsense things. Blaise Pascal said that, when you find out how miserable our existence is, the only solution is God, so the first thing might be religion (even though I'm pretty sure that you're atheist as I am). In this case you might be interested in oriental philosophy, which is pretty nihilistic generally.
Then you can search for distractions as sport, music, art or even drugs; they won't solve anything, at least by themselves. 

Now, I see two solutions. The first one is that meaninglessness, absurdity and loneliness lead to an extreme and complete sense of freedom. Sartre said ""we're condemned to be free"", so of course he knew that this condition is also heavy, but it enables you to do exactly whatever you want, it lets you create your own ethic sense and so on (it is clearly way more complicated than this, but it might be interesting).
The second solution is to follow what gives you pleasure, knowing that too much euphoria might be bad for you. In this sense sports, art and social relationship might help. In particular I'd say the last thing, because we all share the same human condition, even though many people are not conscious of it; but getting into people can make you feel less alone at least, doesn't it?

But I'm quite introvert, so I don't like lots of people.
If it can help, my own purpose is to search questions about our existence, in order to search answers (even the answer ""there's no answer"" can be an answer)

Hope it will help ;)"
