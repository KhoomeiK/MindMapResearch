socialmedia,f06hasc,t3_d3t4ob,1568437865.0,"Hi

Newby here needs some help with hashtags.  Ive been looking around the internet and cant find an answer.  ""Everyone knows"" that you are not supposed to spam accounts with posts using the same hashtags.  Yet no-one can give me an idea of what that actually means.  For example, if I post everyday for a week using different photos of a project, different description but the same tags...is that hashtag spam?

&#x200B;

I apologise if this breaks Rule 4.  I know how to install Instagram.  I just suck using it.  Ta.

&#x200B;

Is there someone here with anything intelligent to say?"
Etsy,eysbrol,t1_eyr3b7e,1567393025.0,Their AI has a terminal case of hiccups.  Its been hiccuping since it was introduced and rolled its useless robot butt through my listings  in 2017.  And yet I dont seem to have too much trouble sending traffic from social media.  More than Blackbird can.
Etsy,eysbhl7,t1_eyrk8qw,1567392784.0,"There's no money in it.  How often do you come across Ming Vases so you can sell it over and over and they get their fees over and over.  even the free shipping, imo, is only a way for them to cut down on their accountancy fees.  No more double entries.  Just one big fee applied to your account.  Convenient.  For them."
Etsy,eyff58k,t3_cwh765,1567047850.0,"They dont take out the shipping. In this case they will charge you a commission and fees on the whole transaction ($214).  Whereas if you charged shipping separately, you would have a commission on the original transaction and shipping.  You have lost $29.17 in fees and charges.  You have to (metaphorically) pay the $24.13 shipping out of $184.83 not $214.13. That's what I said.  Yup. Unhappy face.

 Because it is a running total you will need to go back to find out if they subtracted from your sale any outstanding charges like listing fees that pre- existed your sale.  If you aren't satisfied with the result make them explain it.  Don't forget you may also be paying sales tax on EVERY transaction they put through your account PLUS fees associated with depositing the money.  It just depends on where you live.  Also try the Etsy forums.  There are some sellers there that are very good with this sort of thing."

There are worse things to be worried about when it comes to Etsy.  Actually the initial change to the shop manager, even before New Useless Stats (N.U.S.) was the start of all the problems we now face.  Another change to the shop manager?  It bodes ill, travellers."
Etsy,ete6dqr,t3_cb4ju9,1562724077.0,I dont work for Etsy.  I work for myself and Etsy is just a middleman that is coming up to being past its point of usefulness as far as I am concerned.  And I may not go next week but I will be going.
Etsy,ete5z5i,t1_etcadoe,1562723780.0,"I know they do.  I like my US buyers too but I have come to hate Etsy as much as Ebay.  If fact, Etsy make eBay look good.  At least they are honest about their greed for money."

They have either accidentally ""done rude adult things"" to your account at their end or they have thought twice about blocking you.  Get back in contact with them."

Etsy,es7ybtd,t3_c6atkn,1561683297.0,"Do you have proof of the date and authenticity?  Im not even sure a well argued case around stylistic influences would save you.   So you dont really have a choice do you.  If she paid with Paypal, and the item is not as described, and she makes a claim she will get a refund.  If she opens a case with Etsy and the item is not as described, she will get a refund.  If you are in a country with serious consumer rights protection, and the item is not as described, they will probably override whatever you have in your listing and she may still get a refund.  Even if she paid with a credit card, the bank may still give her the money back.

&#x200B;

Do the professional thing; ask her to send the item back, you will need to pay for the postage if the item is not as described which is essentially what she is saying (if it is just a change of mind she will pay the cost of the postage) and give her the cost of the item back as well.

&#x200B;

Whether you give her a discount or not is up to you.  I probably wouldn't but I would definitely offer a return. And when it came back and I could see the item was in good order, she would get her money back and it will go back on sale again.  If she becomes abusive report her to Etsy.

&#x200B;

And shes right, its not good business to have a black mark on your shop with Etsy, Paypal or the local authorities.  Further, savvy buyers like me specifically avoid listings ""with no refunds"" because its going to be a pest to get my money back if something goes wrong. Id rather buy the same thing from a good business person and have the transaction go smoothly from the get go."

Etsy,erwhl8q,t3_c4gheb,1561343837.0,My advice is to use Etsy only as one outlet no matter what you are selling.  They and other e-Commerce sites are too unreliable and too self-interested to underpin a serious business.  Invest nothing except that which you have earned and put that other money into a safe investment like a bank term deposit.  Sorry to be a downer but...
Etsy,erltdu5,t3_c2lm2i,1560996337.0,"Good question.  I think you breached the dogs privacy.  Perhaps you should have asked permission before plastering Rover all over business cards.  But.  I would be surprised if the COPYRIGHT of the original image passed from you to the buyer on sale so...I suspect what is going on here is a purchaser treating you as a free ride for their own Instagram account.  You did the right thing but its probably a genuine privacy issue, if you want to make an issue out of it."

Anything that involves people or dealing with people is going to bring you into contact with their failings as well as their strengths."
Etsy,erg2gy9,t3_c1oioz,1560824523.0,Im not happy with this system either.  Its a great way to convince sellers there is no money in selling on Etsy.  The bank will charge a fee if the money is going into a bank in a different country from Etsy and it used to appear in the etsy accounts.  They dont do anything for free.
socialmedia,erfto07,t3_c1i15j,1560817611.0,Thanks for your response!
Etsy,erddjcj,t3_c19vxx,1560738518.0,"It personalizes the search based on your search activity. Perhaps at some level the shops you are seeing are also the ones that sell the most. So its sort of old and new search combined because in the past, the algorythmn favored those sort of shops. Etsy is all about the money as a platform these days."
