ADHD,fr2nlfm,t3_gmbirv,1589840461.0,"yes. ADHD brains react the opposite than neurotypical brains to stimulants and tranquilizers. 

since our brain is constantly suffering from a dopamine and noradrenaline deficiency we constantly feel hyperactive. 

stimulants bring our dopamine and noradrenaline levels up on the baseline neurotypical people have. hence they calm is down and sometimes make us tired. neurotypical people start with their noradrenaline and dopamine levels at baseline and with stimulants like coffee raise those levels way above baseline hence making them active and awake.

it's not with everyone though. I'm an primarily inattentive ***hypo***active ADHD and coffee doesn't really do much to my state of being awake other than bring up my blood pressure up slightly.

I used to take coffeine pills before I was diagnosed and I did take up to 400mg a day. this really calmed me down and made me awake at the same time.

it doesn't really make me tired but it can shut up my mind and giving me the time of day to fall asleep. 

sometimes I also take like 2,5 - 5 mg of ritaline to better fall asleep."

there was also this zig zag kind of parting the hair done sidewise popular in the 90s that could make your hair look fuller. I've seen the style come back so you could try that out two.

there is currently a trend in South Korea to shorten some of your hair at your hairline so it doesn't get pulled back and can make your hairline look fuller. I have not tried it yet since my hair is super curly and I'm not too confident about it and also only see straight hair people do it. it's in Korean but you can see what she is going for.

https://youtu.be/2D-eTLwV9D4

may hair is also 2a to 3a (depending the time my hair had  weighing itself down and straightening up) and I just swing my head upside down make the hair soaking wet, combing it out soaking it again and then make a straight cut. that's it. be careful to really be upside down with your head, because if you're looking up and cutting it in front of your face is will give you some ugly unwanted bangs lol."

glad this specialist helped you so much.

I'm also on T3/T4 medication. on a dosage that still 95% of thyroid specialists would not agree with despite me being in good health, no sign of any overdose symptoms and no hypofunction symptoms, and all hormones still in perfect range. still those 95% would want to lower my dose, since TSH is below 0,3 and most of the time even unmeasurable.

Schizoid,fqvfpy0,t3_gl4gz9,1589676308.0,"I couldn't say if it sounds like SPD or not. 

You most definitely hit the list of symptoms of SPD I think. but if there is another reason for it, it is not SPD either way. for example if you would not eat due to chronic stomach pain or constant vomiting and therefore developing a strong dislike for eating and losing weight you would fulfill half of the symptoms for the eating disorder anorexia, but you would not have anorexia. 

Disorders are not set in stone. Some people think depression is like any other depression like a table is always a table - same in any way. but you can use various objects as a table without the object being a table itself - a chair e.g. or a small cupboard. 

I may explain this oddly - bear with me.

mental disorders - including SPD - in my opinion - are rather like movie genres. like movies in romantic genre always have a specific pattern - there are two people they fall in love usually it ends in a marriage proposal. but each and every movie has its own story, its own fictional history, distinct characters, Storyline and so own. 

for mental disorders it is the same. someone with a SPD has their own history, past, character traits and so on. you could also have something that looks like SPD but has another reason. you could also have SPD and additionally something else. 

the things you described are rare. very rare. usually every human has emotions. sometimes people have emotions but are unable to recognise them. sometimes people really don't have any emotions. usually every human is able to feel a -at least - slight connection to other humans. if not to any other human, nearly all humans at least have an emotional connection to themself. 

what you described could have a variety of different reasons. they could be biological (e.g. hormonal), neurological (something in your brain that somehow is wired differently), issues in the early development in early childhood (how your parents raised you), they could be innate versus acquired or have psychotraumatic reasons. 

for example it is possible, that a human being is experiencing constantly things that are so hard to endure, that seeing themselves as an object is easier. 

not recognising faces or rather mimic expression and not doing them naturally yourself and/or doing them oddly like staring too long could *possibly* give a hint to autism spectrum disorder. 

I've struggled if I should keep the following paragraphs in my comment, but decided to keel it in (who thinks I'm making it up: googlesearch Johanna Haarer book): 

I remember a older patient case of a person that went through years of psychoanalysis that was discussed within my studies. this person had a similar set of symptoms e.g. not being able to recognise faces. it turned out their mother had followed rules and guidelines set up by a well meant but evilish awful and destructive self-help book for new mothers: the author advised to not touch the baby and to not console it other than what was absolutely necessary to feed and clean it for not coddling the child with the goal to create a strong and wilful person. it was also advised to only touch the baby with gloves and a medical mask. 

years later with the introduction of psychology people realized babies needed touch, consolidation, warmth, constant facial expressions from their primary caregiver, being talked to and emotional bonding to being able to develop the ability to have and do the same. 

I'm not saying that you or your parents had experiences like that, but it's an example that was an eye opener for me - reasons that are not set in stone in symptoms but are important to understand how people become who they are.

so if you were missing part of what a baby or a child needs, e.g. if you were cared for, rather like an object that needs maintenance than a human being, then this could have been what you learned to feel. 

in the end: the only one to find out is you. 

if not yet done neuroimaging could be helpful to check for neurological factors. a usual check up for hormones etc. can be helpful too. the most helpful would be to have a trustworthy family doctor and go from there. and a broad apprehensive psychoanalytical and psychiatrical diagnostic check up. 

in the end I would suggest to look for any hospitals that specialise in diagnosing complex cases and can do all of this in the same place."

Sure, if you did something bad it's possible to always remember it. 

but there is also something called 'compulsive thoughts'. it's when someone can't stop thinking about something they fear they did in the past or they fear they might do in the future. it can also be about anything else from aggressive to sexual thoughts to thoughts regarding relationships. 

compulsive thoughts don't mean you did the thing you're ruminating about (or want to do now or in the future). 

it can be a sign for a mental illness but it also appears often in people without any mental illness. nearly everyone has compulsive thoughts once in their life. 

so, you couldn't actually know if you did the thing or not from just that thought or image. 

personally I think, if you actually did it you would know about it and wouldn't have to be wondering about it."

I don't understand it as it didn't matter to her what the name of her stillborn daughter was but that she could decide rather liberated since she wouldn't have to follow social norms. 

her stillborn daughter might even *matter* less, which is good. with 3 living children around it is good that those that actually are able to receive attention and love and do need present parents matter more than someone that can only be kept in prayers. 

YTA for taking your hurt feelings out on her and telling her how she is supposed to feel about her daughter.

socialanxiety,fokwmub,t3_g7yu4p,1587850353.0,"the only thing that helped me was to learn driving and gaining enough experience to get comfortable with it. I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning and was scared shitless. funnily enough only in crowded roads, never when I was alone on the road. tells me it was foremost social anxiety. 

years ago I once blocked a three-lane street in the city centre in rush hour and caused a traffic jam. I wanted to make a turn while it was slightly uphill, so when I stalled the engine I was already halfway through a panic attack so couldn't find the sweet spot of the clutch to get the car going again. the other drivers were manic!

I was tremendously ashamed and embarrassed. but then I thought 'who are they to treat me like that?' I mean everyone makes honest mistakes. and when I remembered the lady behind me - her head turned red and she furiously pumped her car horn with a wild expression on her face like she would love to fight me in a 1-on-1 battle and rip my throat out. 

when you take a step back these kind of reactions from others seem ridiculous. it couldn't have been more than a minute, at the most it was 2 minutes I blocked the road. and seriously enough I could've had a medical or technical emergency that caused me to stop driving. but the other drivers immediately blew up hysterically. 

yeah, so long story short: change of perspective. 

also a lot of cussing behind the wheel, no one hears you and it takes away the stress.

Today I love driving! 

It's been 10 years since getting my license and I love driving for around 5."
