I think having it as a 2nd level spell is fine. Now that I know about the check, I have a lot fewer problems with it.

I think it's still on the strong side, but I'd allow it as a trial run in my game. If it starts getting used every encounter, I may rethink it though."
DnDHomebrew,fppfmtw,t1_fppeh7z,1588801400.0,"I misread the part about the check; I apologize.

I do stand by the rest of my comment though. If you have spell casters in the party, a DM should be throwing enemy spell casters (some of which will have Counterspell) at you. It's the most logical counterplay against Fireball or other spells that will mess stuff up regardless of saving throws. In short: I disagree that the negation effect is super situational.

And yes, while it counters only two very specific spells, those spells (especially counterspell) are must-pick spells on any caster worth their salt. If your DM is running an enemy wizard/sorcerer/warlock with 3rd level spells and they don't have Counterspell, that DM is pulling punches.

Honestly though, this spell really seems more like a class/subclass feature than a spell; having a reaction trigger based off something that you're doing is unusual. I could definitely see this as a Sorcerer metamagic where you could spend sorcery points to upcast a spell makes sense to me (although then that would obviously be restricted to sorcerers, which I don't think you're going for)."
UnearthedArcana,fppejaz,t3_gd13j3,1588800831.0,"So, first off: Sorcerers don't get metamagic at 1st level, so one of your level 1 features doesn't do anything until level 3. Also, I think getting to learn 7 of the 8 metamagics is a lot (I believe there are 8 in total but I'd have to double check). Sorcerers are my favorite class, partially because they offer so much customizability: subclass, spells and metamagics. By having them learn 7/8 of the metamagics, you're actually removing customization, and having so many metamagics is so strong, I wouldn't allow it at my table. I think Metamagic Masters needs a complete rework; if nothing else, it should have an effect at 1st level when you get it.

For the Tome of Arcane Knowledge, why not just play a wizard if you want more spell and want a spellbook?

For ancestral memories, what if the character doesn't already have proficiency with arcana?

I agree with /u/TheOvershear that flight speed is overdone on casters, but I think it's fine from a balance perspective.

With all of that said, I LOVE the flavor/fluff of this subclass. I think it has a lot of potential for a lawful sorcerer, which is an interesting take considering I think most people associate sorcerers with the chaotic side."

I also want to say: I frikkin' love Avatar. I just finished rewatching the series and LoK like 2 weeks ago, and in 1 of the 2 campaigns I play in, I'm playing a reworked 4 Elements Monk to simulate playing as, coincidentally, a water bender.

I will give a cursory thought since I did skim it: my first thought would normally be, why not just rework the 4 Elements Monk subclass? However, it is obvious that you put a lot of effort and thought into this, so I think that, while reworking the 4 Elements Monk is probably simpler, this is more than an adequate replacement.

Edit: Also, I may have missed it, but no bloodbending? That's perfectly fine if it doesn't fit the fantasy you're trying to make, but it surprised me a little bit."

Happy brewing!"
UnearthedArcana,fpieocx,t3_gdgtm3,1588639360.0,"So I'm typing this comment as I go:

I've read the base class, and I'm impressed! Good job! My 2 main critiques are that it's relatively complicated (but the mechanics are well written!), but that's fine for the proper player, and that for Arcane Aegis, I'd change it to 1d4 for both attack rolls and saving throws (or a flat +2 for both). +4 for saving throws for 1 charge is very powerful; it could very easily be the difference between a successful or failed Dominate Person, or Disintegrate.

Now, onto the subclasses:

Magus: Not bad at all!

Factotum: I'd lower Opportunistic Piety to 1d6, but otherwise, I think it's fine. Cunning Brilliance leaves a lot of room for unintended loopholes, but it's level 18 feature, so I think it's fine.

Swiftblade: I think Swift Surge grants too many bonuses; having 1 charge is not too terribly difficult to merit these buffs. Arcane Reflexes is too similar to Brains Over Brawn; I'd change Brains Over Brawn to only be Strength and Constitution. Swift Strike confused me at first until I looked at the class table; you forgot to include the Extra Attack text in your document (i.e. no description of it). I think Swift Surge and Swift Strike is too much.

Dark Warrior: Vile Flesh's charged effect should be decreased or at least changed. I'd either make it a -2 reduction or make it 1d4.

Black Magic Oils: I only gave these a cursory look. I think they're fine, but I'd take that assessment with a grain of salt.

Balancing a class is relatively difficult (much more so than a subclass), but I think you've done a pretty good job! It needs pretty minor revisions, but with those changes, I'd allow this at my table (under the condition that we could alter it as we go, in case anything turns out to be bonkers overpowered)."
UnearthedArcana,fpicnp5,t1_fpi8yux,1588638182.0,"Haha don't worry about it! There's so many different sources of DnD information that it's hard to keep all the official stuff straight.

Funny story: when I very first starting playing (like, 1 session in), I found a website full of DnD homebrew and I thought it was all official so I rolled up like 10 characters using all this broken ass stuff."
UnearthedArcana,fpi6jx2,t1_fpi0gi3,1588634667.0,"I thought that might be the case, but I was unsure. I still think you should change it though for the following reasons:

1. As you have it, it looks much more like an oversight than an intentional mistake (you would not believe how many such mistakes I see when reviewing homebrew).
2. It makes the table look weird to just exclude levels.
3. DnD 5e spellcasting tables include all levels, even when there's no change.
4. It removes any ambiguity about why you left out those levels.

You could argue that it makes the table took sleeker, but generally speak, a reader of DnD homebrew shouldn't wonder why an author did something. Yes, they could infer there's no change in the spellcasting progression (but what if there is and you just left it out - remove that ambiguity), but they shouldn't need to make such inferences.

Edit: I'll give this a read-through later tonight."
UnearthedArcana,fphwhgw,t3_gdgtm3,1588629087.0,"I'm commenting so that I can remember to give this a thorough read later, but the first thing I noticed is that on the Magus Spellcasting Table, you left out levels 9 and 20."
UnearthedArcana,fphwadc,t3_gdc9yk,1588628981.0,"I feel like there should be some roll involved for Subvert Spell, maybe a contested check using the caster's spellcasting attribute? Just stealing a Shield i.e. turning a guaranteed miss into a guaranteed hit seems too much. I'd add such a check but make it recharge on a short rest.

Also, for Subvert Spell, I do also like that the spell goes off if you don't use it. It's a nice touch. I also think that this feature makes A LOT of sense for an anti-mage; it's emblematic of the subclass, and that's an important thing to have early on. Well done!

I think Magic Exterminator is fine. For Dispel Magic, you need to clarify what spell level it is. A 3rd level Dispel Magic can't automatically dispel a 7th level spell, but a 9th level Dispel Magic can.

You have to consider that, at max level, Mage Slayer potentially adds 12d8 force damage per turn against any creature that can cast a cantrip (note to self: Fighters get 4 attacks, right? I need to double check that). That might be okay, it doesn't get crazy until high levels when things should be getting crazy, but something else about it rubs me the wrong way. 

It's a very passive feature, which some people may find boring, but also the fluff doesn't make much sense to me. Why is an anti-mage doing magic damage against spellcasters? I think this one needs to be reworked. There's nothing CRITICALLY wrong with it, but I take issue with a fair number of small parts of it.

Spell Tether is a touch complicated, and the complicated bits seem to only really apply to smite spells (and maybe a few others I'm forgetting). I do understand it, and it's pretty cool, but I feel like it should be separated into 2 different features? One for the spell redirection and one for the bonus damage dice? At the very least, I think the first paragraph should be broken into 2.

As a side note, unrelated to the rest of this comment (i.e. it does not specifically pertain to your homebrew): I personally am okay with giving a subclass more features than usual if it's balanced accordingly. I think it's definitely a better option than lumping together 2 unrelated features. The Storm Sorcerer, for example, gets 2 distinct level 6 features, and that's fine!

Back to the main event:

Improved Subvert Spell has a contradiction in it; how can you store 2 spells if you can only use it once per long rest? The logical conclusion is to make it usable your (INSERT ATTRIBUTE HERE) modifier number of times per long rest, but even with the added check I recommended earlier, that seems a little strong.

Shattered Spells is cool. I have no real complaints with it, except does it require an action, a bonus action, no action required, etc. to activate?

I think this homebrew has potential, and a lot of it. I think most of your base mechanics are good (and I LOVE the idea behind it), but they need to be refined a little bit. Whenever I review homebrew, I always include an answer to the question: would I allow this in the game I DM for?

My answer in this case is ""yes"" with an asterisk; there are a few changes it definitely needs (what level Dispel Magic? How can you store 2 spells at once when you can only use it once per long rest? Does Shattered Spells take an action (I would make it take an action, personally, to keep it in line with Antimagic Field)).

This is probably an above-average homebrew that I've reviewed, so good job! Make some revisions, post a new version, and I think you'll have something great!"

DnDHomebrew,fpbcum9,t3_gb1wna,1588467108.0,"Ok, first off, I like the concept. I had a similar idea for a while back called the ""Inquisitor"" (this was before the Inquisitive Rogue came out).

Second, this very much needs to be proofread; I don't want to be mean, but the grammar and spelling is really not good.

Now onto the actual content:

Guardian Angel can be very powerful (giving advantage to all targets of a Fireball is a lot), but you have to be hidden and within 30 feet, so I think it may be okay? You might consider changing it so that it only gives advantage to 1 target? I'm unsure.

Faithful Vessel is basically a strictly better version of the Wild Magic Sorcerer's Bend Luck feature. It is a higher level feature (Wild Mages get it at level 6), but at the very least, this should cost some sort of resource. Maybe it's usable a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per long rest?

Overall, I think this is a fine idea and is actually relatively well balanced compared to most of the homebrew on this subreddit. I do think there's some room for improvement on the balance side of things, but I think that the overall theme is solid and cohesive.

The biggest problem, really, is the grammar. That needs to be fixed or a lot people who you present this to will either 1) just ignore it or 2) tear it apart."
DnDHomebrew,fpaym3o,t3_gccvka,1588458427.0,"I think Science Mage is overpowered; you have to consider that your party will undoubtedly take time to have the Wizard/Sorcerer/Artificer/whatever teach the spells to the Fragmancer.

UnearthedArcana,fpagdaw,t3_gbws8d,1588447608.0,"I think this needs more explanation. What is this about 10th level spell slots (and higher)? Are there 10th level spells, or are these just used for upcasting?

Also, why do you get access to 10th level spells at level 14? I feel like that should be a level 18 feature, as you don't have access to 9th level spells (or 8th, for that matter) at level 14. How many spell slots of 10th and higher level (or rather, how much essence) do I get for access to these abilities?

Additionally, every other Sorcerer subclass gets 2 features at level 1; they tend be 1 active one and 1 passive one. You currently only grant 1 feature, which I'm unsure how powerful it is because I don't know where the maximum number of essence points are (am I just reading the table wrong?).

Also, learning any spell you see cast is bonkersly overpowered. I'm of the opinion that Sorcerers could use access to more spells, but potentially learning every spell in the game (and definitely learning every spell your party knows) is too much.

The level 6 feature is also strong. I rolled up a homebrew with similar fluff, and multiple metamagics was the capstone feature; this was vetted by a lot of people and deemed balanced for a level 18 feature. Getting it so early is just so strong.

Whenever I review homebrew, I always include an answer to the question: would I allow this at my table. Right now, the answer is no for the reasons I listed above, but even more importantly, I don't understand this. If I'm a level 3 sorcerer, am I meant to look at my class table, see I have 4 1st level spell slots and 2 2nd level spell slots, and do the math: 4 x 1 + 2 x 4 = 12 max essence?

That's fine at low levels, but at high levels, you're gonna need either a calculator or pen and paper. That's not a good sign.

I was gonna end the comment here, but I missed the ""you have access to the full sorcerer spell list"" part at level 14. Along with potentially learning any spell in the game, that's just busted. Also, sorcerers don't prepare spells.

Compare those features to a Bard's Magical Secrets: a total of 4 (or 6, for a Lore Bard) spells from any spell list. We'll be generous and assume we're talking about a Lore Bard. So it's 6 spells from any spell list vs the entirety of the Sorcerer Spell List + potentially every other spell in the game + why wouldn't the Sorcerer's caster companions just take a week and teach him/her every spell they know? This subclass is easily the best caster in the game now and that's BEFORE you take into account the unlimited metamagic.

I am restating my answer to whether or not I would allow this at my table: it is a firm no, with the sole exception being if I were running an extremely high-power campaign, where every other PC was also playing similarly homebrewed deity.

I apologize if this comes off as harsh; that was not my intent. I think you have a cool concept, and I think the essence mechanic has potential, but virtually everything else needs to be heavily revised before I'd even consider allowing it."

Healing magic is definitely more powerful now; our Druid usually spends all of her spell slots on heals right before we long rest. For now, that and the hit dice is usually enough to get us back to full health, but because we really, really want to start an adventure with all of our hit dice, we have to rest for 4 days between adventures, so there is a little bit more passage of time.

Personally, I like these rules (I'm playing as a (revised) 4 Elements Monk, if it matters). I think it's a nice compromise between the base rules and gritty realism. 

Speaking of gritty realism, I personally have never played it but I'm not particularly keen to; this campaign aside, I normally play long rest classes, and the idea of not getting anything back over an entire adventure (how can rest for a week in the middle of a dungeon when resting for 8 hours there usually nearly kills us?) does not seem super fun to me."

Then again, a big part of being a Druid is being versatile, so maybe it might be okay? I'm unsure; I'd definitely need to think about.

That might be something that you need to play-test to get a good sense of its strength, is also what my gut is telling me.

With all of that said, it'd definitely be a cool idea if you could get the balance down, but I'd make the changes I recommended in the first comment and leave it so you only get one mask for now, and maybe revisit it after the initial changes are made and vetted?"
DnDHomebrew,fp9p5cp,t3_gc4mwc,1588431565.0,"So, overall, I like this and I'd allow it in my game, so good work!

As always, however, there's room for improvement!

I get the feeling that you were being conservative with your features i.e. actively trying to not making them overpowered, so you may have leaned in on the side of making them underpowered. Does that seem accurate? I say this because I think parts of this are a little weak.

First, I don't think it should take both uses of Wild Shape to don the mask. It's basically sacrificing one very core Druid feature for your subclass features. I can understand one expenditure of Wild Shape, but I think both is a little bit too much for what you get.

Warrior Ancestor, I'm a tad worried because Shillelagh already lets you use WIS for your attacks if you have a quarterstaff/club and makes them magical. I do, however,  REALLY like the idea of a Druid wielding an ancestral weapon. Maybe at 6th level, give them extra attack with it in addition to what they get now? 10th level seems a bit late to get it when most classes get it at 5 (Valor Bards get it at 6, I believe).

This next one is a very minor, personal preference, but I'd remove the requirement that the ancestral weapon needs to be martial. What if my dude wants to wield a quarterstaff? It's not really that major though, and I think you got most of your bases covered (i.e. there's no obvious absence of mechanics).

For the Mystic Ancestor, I love it. It's simple, but simplicity is usually better than overly-complicated, which is what a lot of people lean into a bit too much in my opinion.

I am considered that Mystic Ancestor may also be a touch weak; Land Druids get a lot of spells for free AND they get the rest of their features (although the spellcasting is the big one). This one I'd allow in my game with the caveat that we may BUFF it if it starts to seem problematic.

I may buff the level 10 Trickster feature to be once per short rest. It's similar to a Divine Soul's Favored by the Gods feature, and that's once per short rest despite the Sorcerer being a long rest class, so I think it'd be okay.

I can honestly say that this is one of the better homebrews I've reviewed. I love the flavor (I love that it's not your typical western European whatever fantasy; variety is the spice of life), I think the mechanics are solid, and I think it offers some decent customizability which is always nice.

Good work!"
dndnext,fp9h0hb,t1_fp8kzk0,1588425956.0,"My DM is trying something experimental: short rests function as normal. Long rest function as normal concerning getting back expended resources, but instead of healing to max health, you have to expend hit dice as if it were a short rest.

At the very least, I think it needs to be a higher spell level. Additionally, other spells and abilities that affect your saving throws (Bless, Bane and Bend Luck) tend to have 30 feet ranges.

I'm not a fan of Exploding Armor. When DnD has guaranteed damage, it tends to be the result of succeeding on a save-or-half saving throw, or it tends to be pretty small amounts. A guaranteed 8d8 + some number in the teens is a lot of damage to not have a save.

Some of the spells (namely Arcanopulse and Warp) are there to complement the Arcane Sorcery origin, but I also thought that there was room for more lightning based spells at low levels, so I decided to include them as well.

Please let me know what you think! The question I'm most interested in having answered is: DMs, would you allow this subclass/these spells in your game (assuming you're open to homebrew content, that is)? If not, what revisions would I have to make to allow it?

Edit to clarify: Every instance of Witch Bolt's damage now scales with spell level, not just the initial, hence why I lowered it to 1d8.

DnDHomebrew,fovt5rb,t1_fovlfnm,1588107081.0,"No, I think that that's definitely valid criticism! The fluff is an important part of a subclass (and, honestly, it's the part I struggle most with).

I am a bit confused though: I thought sorcerers (generally) were arcane spellcasters (Divine Souls are the notable exception; they literally have a feature called ""Divine Magic"").

Edit: Also, what did you think of the mechanics?"
DnDHomebrew,fouq3ep,t3_g9npa6,1588088523.0,"So, overall, I like the idea, and I think the fluff is good, but I think it needs revisions.

First, every background in the game gives 2 skill proficiencies (and I think you chose well), and then 2 languages/tool proficiencies. You have the 2 skills, but only 1 tool proficiency. Maybe Alchemist's Tools for a 2nd one?

Also, Healer's Kits don't actually heal unless you have the Healer feat, but more importantly, the feature is bonkers overpowered. 1d6 + proficiency bonus is on par with a 1st level cure wounds, and the rerolling any numbers below half the maximum number puts the Divine Soul's Empowered Healing to shame.

Maybe you only gave 1 tool proficiency to try and balance this out? Even if that's the case, I still think the background feature is too strong.

Most background features are kind of fluff or ribbons; they're not meant to be extraordinarily impactful. A lot of them are means of acquiring free housing, like Artisan or Entertainer.

Lastly, it's important to keep in mind that the PHB lets players customize your background; by the rules (unless your DM says no), you're allowed to take any 2 skill proficiencies, any 2 tools or languages (technically no exotic languages unless your DM okays it) and any pre-made background's feature and inventory.

I recently had a campaign wrap up where I was playing a Variant Human Divine Soul (discredited) doctor, taking the Healer Feat. I started with a custom background, taking Medicine and Nature (like I said earlier, you picked those well) and Alchemist's Supplies and Herbalism Kit for my tool proficiencies. I then picked the Sage background and feature and boosted my INT as high as I could get it (once my CHA was decent, that is). Overall, it worked really well.

So, in short, the one thing that really needs work is the background feature. I would add a 2nd tool proficiency, but the fluff is very good.

Edit: oh, and you need to add an inventory for starting items too."
DnDHomebrew,foueg3i,t3_g9nop6,1588082492.0,"Hello all!

My goal for this homebrew was to make a pretty basic sorcerous origin, something that I would've been comfortable playing when I first started out with 5e.

I also wanted to give the sorcerer a touch more versatility in their spell selection (hence the 3 spells from the Bard/Warlock/Wizard spell lists) and this was the end result!

I hope you like it, and as always, constructive criticism is always appreciated!

Thanks!"
UnearthedArcana,fosikw8,t3_g9cbcv,1588031412.0,"This was my attempt to create a relatively simple sorcerous origin, something akin to the champion fighter.

While I'd of course like feedback on the whole thing, I'm especially curious as to how people feel about the fluff (I feel I'm pretty bad at writing fluff) and whether or not it's too complicated for what's meant to be a beginner's subclass.

Thanks in advance for the feedback!"
UnearthedArcana,for6ta6,t3_g91hg4,1588007152.0,"I feel like Life Begins Again is too strong. If I'm reading this correctly (and I haven't had my coffee yet so I might not be haha), it sounds like it could theoretically give your entire party an Action Surge (technically slightly better than an Action Surge, because with this you can take a bonus action and with Action Surge you can't) PLUS a movement speed bonus.

The thing that I think makes it too strong is that you can do this a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (so probably 5) times per long rest, and I just think 5 AOE (slightly more powerful) Action Surges per long rest is too much.

I would change Life Begins again so that you only get the Action Surge effect once per long rest.

In other news, I'm a bit surprised you chose to give the subclass Mending and Prestidigitation over Druidcraft. Making flowers bloom is super spring-like.

Additionally, I want to say that you've done an excellent job of bringing the Spring Domain Cleric (a concept I never would've thought of) to life. With some revisions, I would allow this in the game I'm DM'ing, and I'd be very interested in playing it.

Overall, very nice job!

Edit: Also, you chose the art very well."

I started out on lamotrigine, but it simply wasn't sufficiently stabilizing my mood, so my psychiatrist added lithium to the mix, which did the trick and pretty much eliminated my mania.

It's still unclear if it's the combination of the lithium and the lamotrigine that's working, or if the lithium alone is sufficient. We've been meaning to lower/discontinue the lamotrigine to find out, but we're only willing to make one change at a time and we're making those changes very slowly/incrementally, and changes to the antipsychotic and antidepressant have generally been prioritized, as they've been causing worse side effects.

That's probably not the best explanation, but I think it's the best I can do without writing an essay haha, so I hope that explains it."
