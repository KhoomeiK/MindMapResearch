It was absolutely ridiculous. They just cancelled the Silver Creek Grape festival and I'm not going to be surprised if they cancel Farm Festival in Fredonia and the Chautauqua Country Fair which I believe is slated for early July.

I'm assuming the fireworks for the 4th will be cancelled. Or ""watch from your house' type situation.

I'm not going to sit in a park or go to a fair in 90 degree heat and wear a mask. No way possible.

news,fpv945o,t1_fptzh6c,1588938918.0,"Everything you said is 💯 accurate.  I have been extremely lucky having the opportunity to work from home. That being said it's definitely not a vacation. I'm still working 12 hour days because I don't have the things a normal office would have easily accessible.  I have over 1000 clients that still require my time and now everyone being in panic mode I'm getting bombarded with calls emails texts. It's virtually impossible to be efficient or effective. But this is what the new normal is like. 

I'm expecting to go back to work mid June at the earliest.  Then playing catch up. Summer is over before it starts. I think every local annual festival has been cancelled already with the exception of the fair.

Co workers that have had trips cancelled are trying to get refunds and even with trip protection they have been unsuccessful. So they are planning on going after everything reopens.

With the numbers still rising daily a reopening here is either going to be delayed further into the summer or we will reopen and the numbers are going to skyrocket.  One of my clients is a doctor at ECMC and he said they are preparing for this to go well into fall/winter.  I'm TRULY trying to grasp how we can reopen locally without another shut down in a month or two.  If you watch the map we are still at about 500 new cases a week. In this small of an area that's huge.  

I head into the city about once a week and it's a ghost town.  If I'm in the field I can't even find a restroom to use. The fast food chains and Tim Hortons are the only things open - but bathrooms are locked.

AskReddit,fozllam,t3_ga4gjx,1588192703.0,"My mom ALWAYS said she was going to haunt me. She passed away in 2018. 

Last July my dad came over and we were talking about her when we heard a huge crash. We initially thought something fell on the roof. 

I went upstairs to where I found a picture that I had leaning against my dresser on the floor - my TV which was also on the dresser in the opposite direction.  Now I had a jewelry box and a hat box in front of this picture. They had not moved. Logically they would have had to be pushed off the dresser. I picked up the smashed picture and STANDING straight up was the small urn containing my Mom's ashes. Dad had gotten myself, siblings and daughter one.

Dad got freaked out and left. The following Sunday we were having dinner and dad started to tell the story of what happened. My youngest brother- a doctor who typically thinks everything has a scientific explanation goes white. He had my mom's urn in a China cabinet. The same day one of the latches came loose and he lost some of the items in there ...and standing straight up was mom's urn.

My middle brother-- is extremely Catholic. Didn't want to hear anything about it. 

About a month later we were at his house for one of his kids birthdays.  He said that he kept my mom in his kitchen cupboard above the fridge. His kids are a bit-- wild and he didn't want them to God forbid dump them. Anyway as he was getting ready for the party he heard a thud. The cabinet was open and guess who was standing on the fridge? Yep. Little Urn.

To this day we are all freaked out by this. The only one who hasn't had anything happen was my daughter. She's also the only one who she didn't promise to haunt. ( Although she's hoping for something to happen)

I don't know what to say-- but mom is DEFINITELY haunting us."

If someone lost income we of course would work with them. However- if a bill passed we are going to be inundated with 5000 people saying they have had a hardship. True or not. We will physically have to go through all this paperwork to see if there is infact a hardship. The entire office is working remotely. This would be extremely difficult if not impossible.

Not to mention if a rent freeze is implimented there is going to be layoffs . Which I know the general public doesn't care but they will when they need repairs and buildings need to be cleaned and there is no staff to do it. Not to mention local vendors who need to be paid.
