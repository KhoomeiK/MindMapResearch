BPD,fqqkpns,t1_fqqcvtz,1589567216.0,I like how you worded it almost like code :)  It does help understanding the causality.
insomnia,fpxh8pd,t3_gfzgja,1588982603.0,I've heard melatonin needs serotonin to work its magic and that tryptophan supplements + a light carb snack helps serotonin production. Also try taking melatonin when the sun goes down or 3-4hrs before sleep.
insomnia,fpxds05,t3_gfvni9,1588980703.0,"So glad you're sharing this. This is the first time I'm reading about someone else's experience but this has been my life for at least the past 2 years. Glad I'm not alone. I came to the same conclusion too but recently I did a whole day of doing nothing, journaling, taking walks and I ended up with the worst sleep anxiety I ever had. Even though I had all the time in the world to reflect on my thoughts I still had more coming up. I honestly don't know how my brain does it. One thing that helps me is taking melatonin 3-4hrs before going to sleep and listening to a podcast or music as I fall asleep."

BPD,fb8me3v,t3_ebvocu,1576617046.0,"I feel this a lot. Your personality is a prism. You are hypersensitive so you are more aware of people's quirks and have a drive towards creating oneself. I don't think it's negative, you should embrace what you have adopted from others. Other people's light will shine through you and your colors are what comes out. And I think it's the same for most people but maybe some of them did this when they were younger because they socialized more or had a more comfortable childhood. If you were under a lot of stress as a child of were lonely maybe you didn't get the same chance as everyone else to grow as fast. I'd say just take what's good and inspiring from others and just embrace it and make it part of you. I think we don't ""find"" ourselves, we create what we are. And that's beautiful and valid. ðŸ’•"

Biohackers,fac88cm,t1_fac1y46,1575935075.0,Same question. What's it used for?
BPD,fac7t3d,t1_fac33zp,1575934890.0,"Same here.
I showed the app to my therapist thinking she would approve but to her it didn't seem like a good therapeutic tool only because it makes you focus too much on your emotions. Like it makes it harder for you to just...live those emotions and not think too much about it. I find it can be alienating sometimes to track all the emotions I've been through and you look back on your day, week, month and you're like wow I'm not normal.
And that's basically all it does. It's fun to see the pattern and compare with friends so you know where you stand but I'm thinking of uninstalling it because I don't see the point anymore. Just allow yourself to be weird and so what if others think your emotions are hard to follow. Butterflies are hard to follow and people love them anyway. ðŸ¦‹ Anyways, just a thought, best of luck to you!"

BPD,f6pfec4,t3_dsdgv1,1573055124.0,"i too don't know who i am.
(i feel like) my bf doesn't believe half the things i say.
i also wish i could ""man the fuck up"" when arguing with him but instead i just fade away.
it sucks and i feel manipulated all the time.
i feel like my friends aren't really my friends and they secretly hate me but that's mainly because i secretly hate them sometimes, over silly things."
BPD,f5q8y15,t1_f5pjyuv,1572374157.0,"Confidence in DnD comes with time. Chances are nobody meant to attack you in that situation but players with more experience might lead more or say things that are riskier. If you have doubts and are close enough to the other players, you could be straightforward and ask them. That way they have a chance to go easy on you at first or give you more room to develop your character so you can feel more confident in the future.
I would also tell myself that, sure, what they say or do might reflect a little bit of truth, but I don't have to make a big deal out of it until I get a proof that they're doing this to be mean to me. So in my book, the best thing would be to openly talk to them about how you feel.
I've played DnD before and I find it difficult for me to keep up with everyone's act and build mine. It's already hard enough for me to interact socially IRL so...I eventually gave up on that hobby. But I know it can be a lot of fun and to feel like you belong in a group is a feeling I still long for.  Best of luck to you!"
BPD,f5q5ovp,t3_dorsg8,1572372923.0,"Sometimes yes but I try to tell myself that relationships are harder to keep for people with that condition but not impossible. There can always be someone who will understand and you can always work on yourself. (But sometimes I think that's bullshit and I'll die alone with 22 cats.)
But really though, I tell myself that it didn't work out before because I didn't have the right tools to manage my disorder but also because my partners weren't fully aware of my condition and what it implies. I just keep hoping the future is gonna be brighter."
BPD,f3szrcy,t3_dhrywv,1571113604.0,DAE feel like they want to reach out and post in this sub but is too afraid to do so in case someone reacts badly to it and the whole thing ends up upsetting you even more?
