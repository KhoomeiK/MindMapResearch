astoria,fpxd6oe,t3_gg0lo6,1588980362.0,I Just moved away from that area to Ditmars. Used to live above Infinitea. They are the best and everyone that works there is so nice. I'm so glad to see this!

astoria,fm0ndmz,t1_fm0dz1v,1585662177.0,You think there should be no doctors or nurses right now? Where is the logic in that? It's possible to fight while still saving people's lives.
nonmonogamy,flup3gp,t1_flu4ocl,1585507101.0,"Hmm, with design like this every little bit matters and can have meaning. To me, it looks like a broken infinity rather than something more unique. I'm super glad you're creating though!"
astoria,fludu4l,t3_fr83f7,1585500625.0,I think Infinitea on Astoria Boulevard is open and before I moved off Astoria Boulevard a little over a week ago I think they were building a to-go window!

astoria,flpo0c2,t1_flol511,1585364181.0,There were only about 8 customers in that particular store at that time. [Cherry Valley on 21st Ave] I'd say the smaller and more hyper-local the store the better.

astoria,flnh9nu,t3_fplry2,1585318572.0,"I’m really glad I moved away from Astoria Boulevard last month because I’m not sure I could deal with the ambulance sirens right now. Not because of the noise, but just the emotional toll."

This is why I don't date people who are new to this. I'm not saying you were wrong to make the decisions you did, but I've been the left hung out to dry so many times because of jealousy. I'm really sorry that jealousy got in the way and that your partner couldn't work through those feelings."
astoria,flmkv0t,t3_fpn2m7,1585286713.0,"It's such a shame that it has to come to this but I'm not willing to be in lockdown for longer than necessary because people just have to selfishly play soccer together.

I seriously wanted to drive my car over and drive around the park blasting grindcore to get people to leave. I lowkey considered it."
astoria,flkm6pj,t1_flkm1dt,1585243519.0,"If you are already out shopping and want to pick up an avocado that is fine. You are allowed to go out for food, safely. Just because you stop at a fruit market for 3 seconds to pick up vegetables doesn't mean you're out at the park playing basketball. Fuck off."
astoria,flklavx,t1_flkczb4,1585243054.0,I love how the second someone posts about something minuscule that makes them happy through all of this horrible shit someone has to come on and say something fucking snarky. Grow up.
AskReddit,flcgf0z,t3_fnszg7,1585029895.0,"Honestly, it got real for me when there was barely any food at the store. Things have since been restocked but that was the first day that I started to feel nervous."

Just looking for like 4 or so more rolls. Buying 100 rolls is hoarding, trying to stock up for one more week because you know more about your personal health than people on the internet isn't hoarding."
astoria,fl62vqg,t1_fl62uum,1584852703.0,Thanks!
astoria,fl62u47,t1_fl62q7q,1584852663.0,"This is how I feel. The hoarding it just so against everything I believe as a human being that lives amongst human beings. Like, even if I took the last 4 rolls from a store I’d feel like shit so I can’t imagine people buying so much that other people can’t have it. Buying one BJs pack isn’t hoarding, buying 5 is. Sigh.

Also I think I’m less annoyed about the TP and more annoyed at the nature of people."
astoria,fl62qjr,t1_fl62jmu,1584852578.0,"We are good for now, but much much appreciated! I’ll let you know if we are in need. I’d rather it go to someone who is lower in stock than me. Mostly worried about the next two weeks if things get really bad."
astoria,fl60cbq,t1_fl5zjtx,1584850564.0,Yup! Just saw. This is hilarious.
astoria,fl60bs8,t1_fl5yi4s,1584850552.0,LOL they are all sold out. All the good brands are sold out it seems? This is officially the dumbest thing I've ever experienced.
astoria,fl5ydu3,t1_fl5wb36,1584849004.0,I thought they were super expensive. What kind do you have?
astoria,fl5yclu,t1_fl5y09x,1584848978.0,I will improvise if I wind up not being able to find any tomorrow. Thanks for your help.

If they were really just “cleaning you up” they would have wiped you down with a wet rag while you still had underwear or pants on. Also the friends could have helped carry you and then left the bathroom while your gf bathed you. You don’t need three girls to wash someone. This is assault. The fact that they can’t seem to understand why this was inappropriate is a huge problem.
