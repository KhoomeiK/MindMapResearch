Hope to hear from ya. I also have discord, and am not horrible at call-outs ***most*** days!"
Anxiety,fr0fi5b,t3_glty5a,1589793775.0,"I have days like this.

I just sit... well — anywhere lately, and think about how many terrible things can happen at any given time. Any movie I watch that involves a terminal illness, any show that includes an accidental death, any news-clip that I somehow manage to watch even while trying to sing songs in my head.

Some days I'll just sit here and shake. Ever get that? The internal vibration that chooses a part of you and spreads? Mine always starts in the pit of my lower abdomen and spreads out. I think my head picks it, and my chest because I feel vulnerable. I just don't want anything coming near the collection of my parts. I want no other living being to be near me or put me at risk.

Then I go back to staring at the wall and trying to focus on something else.

It's a long process, but... (this will sound cliché but bear with me) it starts with breathing. You don't know how bad at it you are until you start really trying to make it competitive. I pick a slow as hell song, and breathe between the measures to make sure I can keep a decent pace of it. Big one in. Hold it. Hold it for longer than 8 seconds. Exhale long. Repeat. Do it until you get bored. Then do it some more. Do it until you are tired of it and want to go do something else. Keep doing it. Then, once all the other thoughts are gone and the only thing left is that good idea you had earlier, get up and keep on living.

It feels stupid at first. Absurd, really. But soon it's gonna be a skill you develop. Soon that unwavering, nagging, heavy feeling that keeps clinging to you will fade. It takes a long time. It doesn't come easy. You're on your way, though. Good luck!"
Anxiety,fqpb7jd,t1_fqp0b1v,1589541383.0,"Hey there. So after my furlough I had a lot of health concerns. Started experiencing regular panic attacks from March into present day. Shortness of breath, super migraines/tension headaches, chest pain/tightness, gut/GI issues, nausea, sweating profusely, and disorientation/auditory hallucinations.

Turns out my anxiety, coupled with severely low magnesium gave me profound panic attacks day after day. I started taking supplements (the short-term solution for me) and slowly over two weeks experienced fewer and fewer panic attacks and anxiety. I know that it's still there, as I've had a few tense hours this week (all triggered by concern for health issues), but the less I ponder over them, the more I focus on trying to build on a miniature routine, the less my anxiety flares. I still feel it deep inside my stomach, all the way up to my chest, and down into my legs. It's like a vibration that never stops. Constant trembling. Constant nerves.

It hits harder at night because we're conditioned to shut all other thoughts out to go to sleep. That's just the window your mind needs to light your bodily sensations up like a flaregun. If you can, find a youtube video that has calming tones to you. Ambient, chill beats, forest noises, the sound of windchimes, whatever you find dull and pleasing. Let that drown your nights out. Take time to play your favorite movies/albums out in your head. Word for word. Lyrics for lyric. Whichever you are committed to, recite them internally. Let nothing come between you and finishing. With any luck, you'll be out before you know it. I did all of these plus a dozen others before I found my winners.

Also, the 4-7-8 breathing technique is a winner. Doing it while listening to music is the best. I stretch mine out to 5-8-10 and I make sure to breathe from my stomach, not my chest. That's the secret. Always deep breaths from the stomach.

I hope you experience some more peaceful nights!

(Additionally, while you're concerned for your health, and you should get yourself checked out for peace of mind — I literally just finished doing this exact same thing. Full physical. Full labs. Urinalysis. Everything came out normal and my doctor was quite supportive of putting my mind at ease. It helped a lot hearing that I had nothing physically wrong with me.

If your GP thinks testing is a waste of time or won't do the tests, get another one who will. This is an integral and positive step towards curbing anxiety and when you discover that you're all right, you will feel so much better. Take care!)"

*""Don't put your employees in contact with a bunch of strangers or each other""*

That's cute and all — but that's not reality. The reality is constantly touching surfaces other people are using. The reality is being within 6 feet of others to meet demands of panic buying all day. The reality is not having PPE because all resources are being redirected towards the healthcare professionals who need it right now. This is the part of ""flatten the curve"" that I don't think people are understanding. You don't do that by exposing more people in close quarters all at the same time, allowing people to trickle in all day long and touch dry surfaces (or damp in a lot of places currently) because of box handling policies right now, and then let those people go back home and potentially take home an infection that's asymptomatic for a week at a time.
