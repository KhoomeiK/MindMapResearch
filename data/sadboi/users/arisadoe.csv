relationships,f3q2dlv,t3_dhpbkd,1571068601.0,there’s a strong lack of communication if you’ve been together for 5 years and you can’t even tell your bf about your bestie’s feelings for you. he justified the break up with an article but the main reason is he probably sensed your sketchy behavior like leaving out the truth/not being truthful/considering your FRIEND’S feelings over the guy you apparently “love”. how would you felt if your bf was hiding a secret admirer? lol. i don’t blame your bf for breaking up with you.
