Do you enjoy your job doing retail or is it a total dead end job?    Even if it is a dead end job there are still good skills to be learned from it if you want to do another job.  If you want to get away from both of these things; well, this is really hard because of the quarantine, but I would suggest just trying something: anything whether it is crotchet, art, stained glass, wood work, gardening, dance...that way you at least feel like you have something fun to do that isn't games.   Hope this helped!   Also, do you want to start reading?  Books are really fun...although they are as sedetary as gamesa.   If you want to learn a subject you can also go to kahn Academy and it is free!

I am kind of depressed also because the therapist I really liked I had to  stop seeing thanks to my insurance changing and this other one that I was seeing moved out of state.  

I have been going through this weird thing where I wish I could be like my dad who was a wonderful teacher, person and magician and my husband is a successful engineer and also a wonderful person. I wish I could be like them and I just am not. No matter what I do, I can't seem to be the person that I want to be.   ry to be really patient, but I just get annoyed easily.  I want to be empathetic but sometimes I do get irritated with people when I shouldn't...I would love to write book or be in plays or be a welder but  whatever talent I used to have when I was younger is gone.  I used to also drink a lot and pretty much blew it even though I was majoring in Radio TV Film and Sociology. I am just depressed because I should have been practicing and working on my craft instead of just procrastinating.   I have these redicoulud fear that I am not worthy of love and I fear that I am just way to self absorbed and narcissistic.


Climate change, Trump, children being separated from their parents, poverty..that stuff really weights on me too..and I hate even reading the newspaper....I just feel like life is horrible for most people unless you are really lucky and are blessed with a good personality and disposition."
ContraPoints,f0xewds,t3_d6y8xz,1569030481.0,"Well, yeah....I mean for way too long Reddit had good and wholesome subreddits along with shit like Fatepeoplehate and Theredpill and GreatApes.   And they finally just started banning those communities. And even know it seems like they just Quarantine them."
ContraPoints,f0xer06,t1_f0rznx0,1569030351.0,It was yet another movie that attacked men!  The monster was obviously a man and then there were violent male bullies.  The lonely good men called themselves the losers!  This is a crisis of masculinity!
ContraPoints,f0xekut,t3_d6bahv,1569030202.0,When I first read the title I thought it was real..  I could totally see Jordon Peterson getting offended by IT for some stupid as hell reasons.  I mean the dude was offended by Frozen.
ContraPoints,ezkdg70,t3_d0x6w3,1567958632.0,"The whole this is like a religion to them really struck me as true.  Even though a lot of alt righters claim to be athiests...they act just like religious fanatics.  They believe they are being persecuted, even though they are the most privilaged suckers imagionable; they believe in fairy tales about how they are somehow superior and deserving.   And they actually think they are entitled to act like complete assholes without any consequences.  It is depressing how so many people are blind to how hate full right wingers are and onstead shout out both sides are bad."
ContraPoints,ezhlezo,t1_ez3k3ha,1567912078.0,The Darkness video was one of my favorites!  I think a lot of people don't realize that making those videos IS incredibly brave...people online can be absolutely brutal.
ContraPoints,ezhl64x,t3_czwvcv,1567911972.0," I know I criticized her earlier in a post about the Men Video
...but I really think she is pretty awesome  and think it sucks she was run off Twitter for expressing an unpopular opinion.   I hope she continues to make videos!"
ContraPoints,eyi9w8p,t1_ey8cz20,1567099517.0,"
I actually really liked the video she did on ""the left""  to me it was the right about of being silly as well as being intelligent and thoughtful. That last video though...it made me cringe so hard."
ContraPoints,eyi9n1b,t1_ey8l12o,1567099417.0,But isn't that just reinforcing the stereotypes that these men already have about women?  Why should women HAVE to dumb themselves down just to appear non threatening.
ContraPoints,eyi96ia,t1_eyh18it,1567099234.0,"As someone who prides herself on being able to lift heavy things and use tools...it really, really bothered me when she did that whole bit with pretending to be helpless and having men do it for her.  And also that reading is hard bit.  I know she was trying to be funny and that she is actually very well read, but that just annoyed me even more.  It is depressing seeing women act like that and women shouldn't have to dumb themselves down to get people to listen."

Sometimes, I think I might have rose tinted glasses about the 90s...The world seemed like a much safer and less hateful place.  Like, I know there was racism, sexism, homophobia and the like--but it seemed like most people knew it was wrong and were trying to not be those things anymore.  I know at least that far right groups weren't having rallies out in the open and running people over. 


Or maybe I am just really, really naïve."
ABoringDystopia,eudx4po,t3_cg0ox6,1563729741.0,"This makes me so angry.  These schools have it set up when you have to put a bunch of funds online so they can buy lunch, instead of just giving them some money for lunch when they can or just allowing them to take it.  They never tell you when the money runs out either until they are really in debt."
DepressionRecovery,eudwt0d,t1_eudr15p,1563729510.0,"It is pretty awful just how common  misogyny really is!  I know people will just say the Red Pill, 
Incels and MGTOW are just boards but they were really active in their hey day...it is scary how many men really seem to hate women.  I know way to many women in real life that really seem to hate women too.  I mean women aren't that bad right?  I have a hard time sometimes not letting myself be feminine because so many people just seem to really look down on femininity. And why wouldn't they?  Who wants to just be ornamental, less intelligent, and weak. 


I have actually stopped hanging out with women that do this annoying thing where they will way overly praise men, but insult women with abandon.  I think it really helps to find female friends that actually seem to like women!"
TrueOffMyChest,eu8sr0o,t1_eu8sf3c,1563563884.0,"I remember when in the news there were these female teachers that were by law raping their students, there was so much shit about how these boys were really lucky and that men can't get raped because they always want sex.  It was really, really disgusting.  People still treat women rape victims like shit too although there is much more support for them."
AskReddit,eu8s6l7,t3_cf78un,1563563517.0,"Freemium games!  Sure Minecraft and Fortnight are free to play, but if you have to keep paying for new levels, skins, characters ect.  See also DLC. I prefer to pay 60 dollars once thank you."
AskReddit,eu8rp5e,t3_cf5xe3,1563563202.0,Either it would be awesome because everyone would be trustworthy..or a dystopia where no one ever talked or communicated and everyone was mad at each other.
AskReddit,eu8rhll,t1_eu5o47t,1563563067.0,"One thing I liked about Myspace was you could be kind of creative...you could blog and design your page a little.  You were also only really supposed to add friends and it was just social.  Early Facebook was like that too.  Too many people just started treating it like it was a replacement of their social life, instead of just being something fun."
TrueOffMyChest,eu8r7h1,t3_ceyxew,1563562889.0,"Holy shit,that is absolutely awful! Those therapy groups should be completely ashamed of themselves because therapy is supposed to help anyone.  Men can absolutely be raped and women can be predators.  This should not even be controversial. I hope you get the help you need!"
