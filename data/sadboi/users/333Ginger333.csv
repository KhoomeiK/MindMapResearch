Characters like Moxxi, Earl and Marcus have their own little areas within the game. Scooter had the same thing and Ellie did as well in BL2. The issue I have with it is that it feels like Ellie has been pushed out of the area she was in into a more major role and now it just feels forced.

AskMeAnythingIAnswer,f7lsubf,t1_f7lei53,1573847466.0,"I guess I knew when I realised that these behaviours that I was partaking in were uncontrollable to me. All actions around food for me, whether it be consuming or thereafter, were a compulsion that could not say no to. If I didn‚Äôt listen to that voice in my head and do as they said, then I would have a freak out. So I guess I was around 16 when I knew but I couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop it. 

In regards to the anxiety, I have an amazing support system. Also I am on medication. If I find myself getting worked up about something or someone and it is affecting me in a negative way, I remove myself from the situation and just take some me time. Use this time to reflect. I do a lot of self-awareness and my friends are always there for coffee and a vent. I also visit my counsellor when I know things are starting to build up for me and we can work through it together. I do my best to not internalise things and feelings anymore, as they would only build up and eventually explode and that is never fun for anybody. 
My advice to you would be to talk to a professional. I know it‚Äôs hard but you will find the person that is a good fit for you. In the meantime, it sounds dumb (I say so because I always rolled my eyes at anyone who mentioned it) but breathing exercises are bloody wonderful. The one that works best for me is 5,4,3,2,1. 
5 things you can see
4 things you can hear
3 things you can touch
2 things you can smell
1 thing you can taste  
If you do this during a panic attack, it will distract you for long enough to help regulate your breathing (I‚Äôm a hyperventilator) and heart rate in order to let you calm down. 

Basically just know that it will all be ok one day."

She has PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and it causes her to have the ability to grow one hell of a beard. I said to the kid that my friend is a little bit different and that makes her a special human. The child smiled and acted like she‚Äôd just met a superhero or something, hugged my friend then ran back to her mum. The mum can over and apologised for the child and my friend and I laughed and said it was ok. 

My friend said to me later that she never knows how to respond to questions like that because she‚Äôs always been bullied for having a beard and being overweight.

2. I‚Äôve always been a very outgoing person, for lack of any other way of saying it, an introverted extrovert or something like that. I have no issue talking (am usually the loudest in the room to be honest) so saying hi and having a general small talk conversation has never been an issue for me. It takes me a while to trust someone but I don‚Äôt hate anyone, except like 2 people (again, another story) and don‚Äôt really dislike anyone. The only time I do is if they do something negative towards me, but otherwise 8 don‚Äôt like or dislike anyone, more kinda middle ground. When meeting new people, I always have an open mind and do my best not to judge straight away. I am as nice as possible to everyone I meet. 
In terms of making friends, I‚Äôve never really personally struggled with that. I am naturally a people person. (Side note, im Also a zumba instructor so that is a lot of my social side of things). But in saying that, I am claustrophobic in large crowds. So when I say ‚Äúpeople person‚Äù I mean I like human interaction but i cannot handle large crowds or lots of intense stranger people. Ultimately for me, throughout my recovery process I have learned what my boundaries are, and how to look after myself in that way. I don‚Äôt go out to town, like ever, and I don‚Äôt even go to parties that often, unless special occasions, but I enjoy the company I keep. I have a relatively small circle of people who I love and trust and I‚Äôm happy with that. 

3. In life things are always going to be there to ‚Äòfuck you up‚Äô but ultimately I would say to learn about yourself and who you are. With a psychologist of who you have a good relationship you can and will learn ways to get through any hard feelings and emotions. It‚Äôs fucking hard and takes time, but it is worth it. I‚Äôm now in a place where if something is negative in my like, fuck it. I don‚Äôt care for people who don‚Äôt care about me. I used to be that person who would go above and beyond to make people like me. But now I don‚Äôt care if you like me or not. You want to be my friend? Cool. You don‚Äôt like me? Cool. Whatever floats your boat. At the same time though, if any disrespects me in any way. I will flip my shit. And have no problem with doing so. But all of these things take time and work.

First, a lil bit about me. I‚Äôm 21 F and currently in university studying science. 

I grew up on a farm so hiding wasn‚Äôt that difficult. I was bullied really badly in college (high school if you‚Äôre American or something. In NZ it is called either high school or college, depending on what school you go to, and tertiary education is all called University) and became really depressed really fast. First I started with hurting myself and very quickly became addicted to it, going from once a week to every day in the course of about 2 months. I started to restrict my food intake unintentionally (I just wasn‚Äôt hungry and lost my appetite), until it was brought to my attention by a teacher that I‚Äôd lost a lot of weight really fast. Many things happened throughout my high school and I progressively got worse but held myself together physically for the sake of my family, also for not getting caught (I was always the good girl and was terrified of disappointing those I care about). I was also suicidal and tried to kill myself on three separate occasions. It didn‚Äôt work, so I woke up the next day, cleaned myself up and carried on with my life as if nothing happened. My final year of high school a family member I was really close to got cancer (diagnosed in January, died just before Christmas) and I held myself together physically but mentally I was still a whole ball of fucked up. I moved out of home as far and as soon as I could. 

My first year of uni was fine. I flew through without much effort. Second year I had a complete mental breakdown and jumped down the bloody rabbit hole. My physical health go so bad that I was failing all tests and exams, I was passing out in the lab, couldn‚Äôt concentrate and was becoming suicidal again. I didn‚Äôt care if I woke up the next day or not, but when I did wake up I would get dressed and go to uni as normal as I could possibly manage. I scared the crap out of my friends and even had lecturers speaking to me after I suddenly went from being a B+/A student to failing over the course of just one semester (like I was getting 20-25% on tests, needing 50% to pass) saying that they were seriously worried about me and my health and pushing for me to get help. Yea, well I brushed all that off because I didn‚Äôt care. The kicker was I scared the absolute crap out of myself by almost dying at a moment that I wasn‚Äôt actually trying to and realised that I didn‚Äôt actually want to die. I didn‚Äôt want to live that way. I wanted a family and a proper life. With the help and support of my friends at uni and with my lecturers being completely on board, I checked myself into a rehab centre. 

Just gonna put this in too as a lil tidbit. I was in an extremely emotionally abusive relationship for the 3yrs of uni and broke up with him my second week of treatment. Never looked back even when he was begging me to take him back again (we had broken up once previously but got back together after a month) and was raped in a club bathroom within two weeks of moving to the city, so yea, that was fun........not. 

It has now been almost 8mths since I finished the course at the treatment centre and my life is honestly so much better. I still battle but no where near as much as I was. My lecturers, flatmates and friends all know and they are all amazing people, and I am now on track to finally graduate my degree. It will have taken 4, 1/2 yrs to do a 3yr degree but hey. It‚Äôs ok. I advocate for body positivity and am supportive of anyone who may speak to me. 

Just to clarify one thing. I did try to talk to my parents about it but they really didn‚Äôt take it well. Started yelling at me and saying that I was doing it for attention. They are wonderful people and I am extremely close with them, but they just didn‚Äôt understand mental illness. I stopped trying to talk to them about that because I didn‚Äôt want to cause them any hurt. In saying that though, I have since been able to slowly talk with mum about anxiety and depression. They way I did that was I told her that I struggled with depression and anxiety and that‚Äôs why I was failing so many papers at uni. Initially she was mad but after about a year or so (during the time of which one of my parents best friends committed suicide, which sucked ass but it did start them thinking about mental health is a different light which is ultimately beneficial. Shitty reason though) mum started to bring up little things. For example, I‚Äôm open about my panic attacks and one day she asked what it was like to experience one. That was a wonderful conversation. 

P.S. I don‚Äôt mind questions (in fact. I love questions, I‚Äôm very open about my struggles and all that) but just sayin that I won‚Äôt talk about ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù sort of thing. I REFUSE to help someone down this fucking horrible hellhole. 

TL:DR. I suffered from an eating disorder, anxiety and depression and almost died because of it. Hid it from my family for 8years. Tried to talk to family but to no avail. Hit my breaking point, checked into treatment. Completed treatment and am now beginning to live an amazing life.

Yea, if you read this till the end, you‚Äôre a bloody legend ‚ù§Ô∏è"
