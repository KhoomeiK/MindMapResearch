The Republican Party is facilitating this because power is power. I hope if you are in America you are doing all you can to make sure he’s voted out of office in November.

It was only a couple of years ago I managed to reframe the incident into it not being my fault at all and that I should never have been put in that position as a 9yr old.

Dyslexia,fol9iuz,t3_g80ql6,1587857569.0,Yep I have all those. I’ve only just opened up about my dyslexia and I’m 40. I’ve know all my life I’m dyslexia and am only a few points away from genius when I was tested in my teens. I’ve found work arounds to mask my dyslexia but it’s exhausting. I don’t think my upbringing helped much though. I my mother used to laugh at the spelling mistakes I made and nothing I ever did was good enough. Many other things on how I was raised has also impacted on my self esteem and confidence. But the dyslexia didn’t help as I always thought it was a weakness and I was stupid but instead it gives me strengths which I didn’t realise I had which other people have. But I’m only just learning this now. So I’m hoping doing this now I will become the best version of my self
