hi,I just wanted to thank you for showing me the meditation post,it actually helped me speak to her (my tulpa).

I read on a lot of guides that I can do it any way I want,so I started by visualizing her first,then I made a wonderland and kept talking to her,hugged her n stuff. 

Is that ok? Because I kinda feel like it's working,since I can feel her presence,even if she doesn't speak.

I was also wondering if it's okay for her to go away for a while? Yesterday I woke up to her hugging me,but today she wasn't there,I couldn't feel her and i'm starting to get worried.

Thanks in advance."
