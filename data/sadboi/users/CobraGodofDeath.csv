SuicideWatch,fqbp6he,t3_ghjgnt,1589241242.0,"It's good that you have someone in your life like that. Whether it hurts you or not, it might help in more ways than you could know. I don't know what its like to be bipolar so I can't understand it as much as I want to, but I do know what its like to be suicidal and have great people in your life, but still think you're not worth anything. You have to try not to forget that you're not alone though, and you have people there for you in your corner. You've survived all your worst days, and its sometimes easier to live for someone else than yourself. If you need to talk at all, I, as well as many others here, are here for you."
