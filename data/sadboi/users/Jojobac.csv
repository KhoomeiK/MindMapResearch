Dogtraining,fo70pk8,t3_g62beu,1587570190.0,"Read some books on positive reinforcement training! Be consistent, firm, and gentle. Don't let the puppy get away with something you don't want the dog to do. Puppies are cute when they jump. An adult Ridgeback is not! Don't let the puppy do it! 

Set schedules that match what you will be doing when the isolation ends. That might mean your dog stays in the crate longer and longer each day until it can handle being in there as long as you're home for work. 

Exhaust the pup every chance you get! A tired dog is a good dog. Good luck!"
Dogtraining,fo703dd,t3_g62i3o,1587569878.0,"Sounds scary, frustrating, painful, etc. I don't know that there's a ton of good answers other than consistent, gentle correction. One thing that helped me with my old dog when he did the same thing in the backyard was to leave the leash on him and stand on the leash when he tried to jump. Once he calmed down I would let up. 

I'm really interested to see what others say, because I have an increasingly energetic puppy who needs some correction!"

Most jobs shouldn't/can't require you to disclose the nature of your illness unless it's taking you out of the workplace for multiple days in a row, in which case they can require a doctor's note.

Also, good for you, taking a day. I recommend NOT doing what I always end up doing: just lying in bed watching TV and surfing the internet. ðŸ˜¬"

Anxiety,fcwb1aa,t3_ej29di,1578021263.0,"I call it my existential dread. I mostly feel like my job is the best one to have, since I have to work. I'd rather not have to rely on it, but such is life. Reminding myself the things I like about my work helps me during the times I feel like I'm weighted down by having to do this for 30 more years. 

Someone else said to figure out what you like. I agree, but would add to figure out what you care about. Some people feel like their job makes a difference in the world, some feel like their job makes good money for not too much stress. I feel like my job is something I'm passionate about, and it adds good to the world. 

This doesn't stop me from feeling depressed by the thought of working for the rest of my life, but it helps me survive the hard times.

I would also like to add that working for the federal government is the worst! All the bureaucracy and paperwork and lower pay and none of the private sector perks. But it's also awesome in that you've got great retirement benefits, you're not expected to work more than 40 hours a week, and you get awesome amounts of leave. Some of these perks of my government job really help me endure having to do this for a lifetime."

They require a subscription, but there are podcasts and other ways to get done guided meditation free.
