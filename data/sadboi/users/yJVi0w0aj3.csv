ADHD,fjeuhvf,t3_fcx8pt,1583278457.0,"For me ""reason"" means understanding why the situation is like it is and why I work differently."
ADHD,fi1v7gu,t3_f5r2x1,1582065455.0,"I feel kinda the same but at the same time not. Let's say that I've got an appointment in the afternoon. Like 3 pm. Then I'll go and think about that appointment for the whole day and not be able to focus on anything else. Therefore I always try to get times for my appointments in the morning. But that doesn't really solve the problem though. Sometimes I'll just leave after that appointment with a million thought which will also make me unable to focus on anything else for the whole day (sometimes even the day after and so on).
I'm a professional when it comes to overthinking and analyzing things that I don't need to overthink or analyze."
ADHD,fi00zas,t1_fhyua13,1582021311.0,I'll go buy a pair of Bose QC II today hahah. Didn't need much time to make that decision.
ADHD,fhypl75,t1_fhy2589,1581980923.0,"Music while shopping or being in a busy mall is nice and all but do you have this issue as well where you get really frustrated because you still hear the background noise of all the people around you and it's like overlapping the music to the point that you focus less on the music and more on the background noise?

Yes, I know that noise cancelling headphones are a thing and I'm thinking about buying a pair but sadly they are expensive as hell :("
