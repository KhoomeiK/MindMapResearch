I think I've scared away lots of guys because of that, I don't want to do this again. How can I approach the texting topic the best way possible? Do you have any tips?"

relationship_advice,fmglk19,t1_fmgl95m,1586051712.0,I'm trying to be as gentle as I can with her as to not get her to drift away from me. I'm just worried because he's not the calmest person and has been extremely rude to her lots of times â€” it can definitely grow into something worse. Thanks for answering
relationship_advice,fmgl8jf,t1_fmgdlhe,1586051514.0,I can't force her to anything. I'm trying to be as gentle as possible as to her not drift away from me and see my perspective on their relationship. I am really worried about what could happen to her. Thank you
relationship_advice,fmgl2ta,t1_fmgclhq,1586051412.0,"Telling her mom is definitely one of my thoughts on this whole situation, unfortunately I don't think pressing charges would make a difference in the country we live in. Thank you"
relationship_advice,fmgku01,t1_fmgk684,1586051254.0,"She never had any type of behavior that could lead to candidia, her boyfriend literally goes days without taking a bath and uses the same underwear for like ever. They don't need to experiment different types of condoms because in the end he always takes it off without her consent, anyways. I can't force her to anything, just like her boyfriend can't force her to have unprotected sex all the time. It's not intense, it's abusive. I'm trying to make her see it too, that's why I wrote this post."
Anxiety,fm3kofl,t3_fstzi8,1585726931.0,"I don't think this is helpful at all. I agree with the part of accepting who you are because you can't actually change everything. But telling yourself you're ugly? That you're boring? That you're dumb? That's definitely not the way to go.

You can't accept yourself when the 'you' that you see is full of negative aspects that you chose to label. You don't accept yourself as 'ugly' or whatever the hell you choose, you accept yourself as 'you', and that's it. That's how you build self-esteem.

One's perspective is never the absolute truth. We're all individuals full of potential to be anything, from pretty to a fucking genius. But you can't reach these states of mind when you label yourself as the contrary."
Anxiety,fm3k6g0,t3_fsue03,1585726409.0,"At least in my case, anxiety always comes with lots of insecurities. You don't need to solve any situation that might be provoking the anxiety on someone if you can't. Sometimes, when you have an anxiety crisis you feel totally lost and alone. Saying things such as ""I am here for you"", ""We'll go though this together"", ""You're not alone"", etc can be of great help. Also, anxiety can lead to thoughts that don't always represent the actual reality, getting the person to calm down and put logical thought into the situation can always help as well. 

The things you shouldn't do are all the ones related to blaming the person for what they are anxious about. It's not their fault. Believe me, they would stop if they could. It's hard to keep your thoughts straight and realistic when there's a voice in your head making you question and doubt everything. Be nice and empathetic. Be there for them."

relationship_advice,fm3itzd,t1_fm3crer,1585725025.0,"I guess my behaviour comes from lots of insecurities because of past failed relationships. I feel like I'm always just waiting to be dumped.

Anxiety,fly79s7,t3_frslfn,1585596846.0,"You are definitely not alone. It's even harder when talking about romantic relationships. This need of reasurrance always make the ""I do like and enjoy your company"" message they sent you 5 minutes ago seem like the biggest lie someone has ever told. I knew being in quarantine would enhance all these feelings, but I didn't thought they would be so hard on me like it is right now. I know what you are going through and something that could help you is making a list of all the times your friends showed that they actually love and cherish your presence - read that when you are feeling low. It is not that much of a help (at least for me), but it helps me remeber that these thoughts are not the reality, they are just your anxiety speaking. Wish the best for you, we'll get through this."
depression,ffjzjrt,t1_ffjyrri,1580011285.0,"He told me once he felt like he could trust me and we've talked a little about some really personal stuff of his that keeps him down. I'll keep trying to reach him, even if it saddens me sometimes when he's distant and even a bit cold. He doesn't deserve to go through all of this alone. Thank you so much."
depression,ffjz9f4,t1_ffjynuv,1580011057.0,"When I ask him out, he says he doesn't have money at the moment and his house is really not a good environment (to which I agree). Although, I'll try to convince him to let me pay him a ride to somewhere, even though he doesn't like when people do this. I just hope I don't seem too clingy and desperate to see him and it ends up being annoying. Thank you for answering."
CasualConversation,fb5pgid,t3_ebl1lz,1576531936.0,"She seems to be the kind of person that needs to put other people down to feel good about herself. From what you've told, the friendship you both have has more negative than positive results in your life.

A friendship should be about supporting someone you like, and if there is criticism, it should always be constructive. I'm sorry to say it, but if she keeps putting you down and restraining you to get better at anything, she's not your friend at all. Some people can only feel confident with themselves when they degrade others.

You need to be close to people who encourage you to be a better person instead of judging you for everything. You deserve better and I am sure there are lots of people who could be a better friend for you than she is. Put yourself first, don't let people keep treating you badly, you are worth so much more than going through this."
