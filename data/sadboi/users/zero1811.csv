relationship_advice,evcdwxw,t3_cj8egj,1564412954.0,I'm so sorry! This is truly awful. Honestly the closest I can relate is when my family said they forgot me when they went on vacation for memorial day. But honestly I feel so much hurt for you because it seems like even through communication they are still pinning blame on you. If you wanted to have a relative take care of the family pet and left back to school I honestly think it's totally ok. You deserve to take care of yourself.
AskReddit,ev7bn90,t3_cikyn2,1564257693.0,"As hard as this sounds, be confident in who you are. Its helped me a lot. I had panic, psychosis episodes that lasted 4 hours at a time about every other day until I was diagnosed officially with bipolar and panic disorder. Really what helped me through this was confidence I would pull through and self love regardless how hard that was for me. I am so sorry that this might be affecting you and I really do care and hope you pull through stronger than before. Its nothing to make light of in this world we live in. Know that you have a beautiful purpose more than just breathing anxious lonely breaths. You WILL pull through and I hope you find support in this community and others."
bipolar2,ev3dysj,t3_ci2hrd,1564193478.0,"Always know you are way smarter and more capable than anyone can actually understand. People will almost always stay ignorant so keep that belief in yourself. Unfortunately, I understand in some way in my own version where I will seriously struggle cognitively and have had consequently had to deal with real adult bully coworkers. It really sucks not being able to have that manic confidence but just remember, as a community of people who understand too much of what you are saying we will all support each other in this little, beautiful internet community. I'm here if needed."
