Advice,fq0tf5d,t3_gge7uc,1589037402.0,"I think boring is more of an opinion. I listen to classical music and write classical music. I write stories and play a lot of video games. I'm more of an introvert but my friends understand that and we still have fun when we hang out of have parties together. I think you just need to find more people who have similar interest as you. Maybe you need to branch out more and try new activities, clubs, and find a new friend circle. Don't think of yourself as boring because everyone has something about them different. I wish you luck!"

relationshipgoals,fo075ia,t3_g4uyx1,1587407258.0,"We haven't been together very long but this boy literally swept me off my feet when we first started talking. This boy made me dinner, lit candles, made me tea, and played video games with me for hours (which may not sound romantic but I'm a huge gamer girl). Not to mention he's super funny, nice, and cute. He always calls me beautiful and kisses the back of my hand. After our first like real date I guess you could call it, he literally got down on one knee and asked me if I would do the honors of being his gf because he couldn't risk me getting away. Needless to say this boy has my whole heart."

Thoughts,fnl407f,t3_g2ev7t,1587046534.0,"I struggle with bipolar II disorder, and it's the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. I have long episodes of depression where I hardly eat, can't sleep, don't socialize, and can't get anything done. At the same time I have shorter periods where I feel invincible and happy. These moments have their downfalls too because I talk a lot, make last minute crazy decisions, and spend a lot of money. My manic episodes aren't as full and long as regular bipolar disorder though. I tried medication but I had a bad allergic reaction to most and others I slept almost constantly. Like yeah I feel great, but I dont have the energy to do anything with it. I struggle a lot, but as I get older I learn more ways to deal with it. I know it will pass, and I have a list of things that make me happy. I do what I feel like doing at the moment and it helps. Having a hobby as a distraction is a great way to get through the moods also. Also, chemically, it helps to eat right, exercise daily, and take vitamins of B12. It doesn't get rid of the low moods all the time, but it certainly helps. Focus on yourself and figure out the best way to cope. I know sometimes it seems impossible and it's always okay to ask for help especially from a medical perspective. Things won't always be bad. Just remember that."
introvert,fnl1j5i,t3_g29bl8,1587045066.0,"THIS. I understand this so much. I want to be alone and happy without being lonely. I have moments where it is like that but it's often fleeting. I want to be happy, independent, and single but it's often a battle."
AskMen,fnkyba7,t3_g2a968,1587043003.0,"I really believe you attract people by the vibe you give off. That being said, stable attracts stable, unstable attracts unstable, and so on. You might have to change and try something different or go some place to meet people you usually wouldn't and stay very opened minded. I was the type who would somehow find very asshole guys even though they looked and seemed like my type at first. I went way out of my comfort zone and found a guy who I usually wouldn't go to because he didn't seem like my type at first but he really won me over."
introvert,fnkstvu,t1_fnjwval,1587038949.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. I can imagine it's very hard not being to get any alone time. I really believe it's the little things that help. If you can maybe go sit outside or put some headphones on and block out the world for a little bit. Everyone needs alone time and I'm sure if you told your family to leave you alone for a few hours they would understand.

introvert,fncmvmt,t1_fncmoei,1586840915.0,I know right! It's so frustrating and I keep so many unread messages that I very carefully don't click on. Trust me messaging me multiple times won't get you in my pants
introvert,fncm7a9,t3_g0xg5f,1586840378.0,I'm so glad I'm not the only one! I'm antisocial which sometimes translates to being a crappy friend because I dont always answer texts at a reasonable speed. Texting twice bothers me even more most of the time. Especially when it's men trying to flirt/talk and they think texting me multiple times a day when I don't answer the first time is acceptable. It's not anyone's fault. Sometimes I just don't want to talk or be social. I like my alone time without feeling obligated to talk to someone

Thoughts,fn3qmr3,t3_fza3lc,1586626017.0,"As a female, I understand that guys usually have a little harder time keeping a conversation going. Not in a bad way but girls do tend to talk a lot more. I always try to ask questions and keep the conversation going because frequently guys will stop texting when they don't know what to respond. To me, it's not insulting when a guy tells me he didn't know how to respond. Some texts are simply just not textbackable (I know that's not a word but I like it). If the conversation ever gets too hard to keep going just tell her the truth, and you're sorry but dont know how to respond. It's too frustrating to keep up a conversation with someone who only replies yes, no, okay, etc."
mentalhealth,fn3fj31,t3_fz76og,1586619696.0,I understand this feeling. I've always been overwhelmed by what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be that I never started anything because I couldn't make a decision from so many options. This probably sounds like crappy advice but you just have to start. I'd say try one thing one day and another thing the next. Try everything and you'll figure out the things you like best to focus on. Once you find a hobby you really enjoy it kind of fills a void and you'll want to stick to it.
AmItheAsshole,fn35v2r,t3_fz4ls2,1586613606.0,YTA. I dont think you're a huge one but you are. I dont blame your friend for not trusting you but I don't think it's that she doesn't trust you completely. It's just that she doesn't trust you in the aspect of advice for skin care. This situation is something that will pass and you two will laugh at it later so don't blow it out of proportion. It happens all the time no matter what age. If it makes your friend feel better put lemon all over your face and tell her you're truly sorry.
introvert,fmzp07m,t3_fya9oh,1586526392.0,I understand that completely! I love my friends but when we go out together and have to be social it drains me. I'll talk a lot and act like a social butterfly but deep inside I just want to go home. It's also rough because I live with 3 roommates who are also my friends. The best thing is though they're very understanding and they will leave me alone in my room when I need to recharge. They're also the best to spend time with because they don't expect me to be super social and they love me anyways. You just have to find the right friends who understand you.
relationshipgoals,fmnov7k,t3_fw17ls,1586231277.0,"This is the best. Honestly this kind of restores my faith in love. I have had a lot of mental problems and issues in the past, and I feel like once I open up about them no guy will look at me the same.

mentalhealth,fjf3os1,t3_fd4l2o,1583283633.0,"I'm not in anyway an expert, but I believe you can be. I have horrible mood swings and I have periods (lasting usually about a week or 2) where I'm super depressed. I also have periods where I'm very manic and nothing brings me down. There's random attacks where something sets me off and I'm so irritable and angry. I didn't realize it wasn't normal until one of my exes brought up that I may be bi polar. I never thought about it but I didn't think he was wrong. I thought I could handle it by myself until things got really bad. I went to a therapist for awhile and got diagnosed with bi polar 2 disorder. I was well aware there was something mentally wrong with me, but the most important part is how you decide to handle it."
mentalhealth,fjal43p,t3_fcac59,1583175608.0,"I've never actually opened up about this but here it goes. It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend left me because I tried to commit suicide. I moved back to my hometown to be with him, but during that time I was too depressed to enjoy my life. I was almost 20 and I wanted to begin my life as an adult, write music, and better myself, but he was constantly putting me down. He would tell me I was wasting time trying to do music, and I was also a burden on him because of my mental health issues. When i tried to overdose, that was the last straw. I called him crying, and he told me he couldn't take this anymore. He made it all about himself and broke up with me over the phone while I was trying to end my life. My mom was the one who took me to the hospital and saved me after I called her saying I made a horrible mistake. I was so so broken. I missed work for a whole week and completely stopped my college classes. It took awhile before I finally told myself that this has to stop. I tried to proceed with life but it was too hard to focus with the annoying voice in the back of my head that still wanted to die. So, I decided that distracting myself was my best option. I exercised everyday, went to work, improved x10 in my college classes, and worked on my music almost nonstop. It was about a month later that I went on tour with a band as a fill-in keyboard player. It was probably the best experience of my life so far, and it inspired me to do better. A couple months later I moved to a new city, and I'm living with my 2 best friends. I have an amazing office job, I still write music and perform, and I intern at a nearby recording studio in exchange for recording time. For the first time in my entire life, I can say that I'm completely happy and I'm so proud of myself for not giving up. I also just recently got back into the dating scene and I've let go of any grudges I held towards my ex (needless to say I never talk to him nor do I want to but I wish him well). Don't give up when you're struggling the worst and things feel hopeless. It just means they can only get better from there if you have the will."

AskReddit,ffk1tn0,t3_etts4s,1580013212.0,"Coming from someone who has been too far down to see the sun, there never seems to be a right thing to say. No matter what anyone told me I never felt better. But, I realized I didn't want things to keep getting worse and then end. I didn't want to give up on things getting better. I made a list of all of my favorite things and started working towards what really mattered to me. I went out and did things that personally made me happy even though I never made time for them before. When I was so close to giving up and contemplating suicide, things completely turned around. All within a week, I got a gig with a band, got a new job, and got the opportunity to move in with my best friends. I've never been happier than with what I've made for myself. No one was there to help pull me out of those dark times, but I really hope someone is there for you. When this is over and you smile the first real smile in a long time, you'll feel invincible. Dont give up before things get better. Fight for your happiness. ♡"
