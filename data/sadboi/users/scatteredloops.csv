A friend was flogging me, which was good and I was having fun, but then I started to feel *odd*. Not sick or sore or anything I recognised, but definitely not right, and it worried me enough to let my friend know I needed to get down. So he untied me, helped me down, and took off my blindfold. I then found out I couldn’t see, which would normally concern me, but whatever this odd feeling was, I wasn’t worried. It was this weird “oh, that’s interesting” kind of response as I sat there feeling dopey. 

He, however, was worried. We sat down and he sent someone else for help, and kept talking to me. Apart from an odd disconnected feeling, I was okay. After five or so minutes I started to be able to see again, first with just lighter patches before resolving to normal vision. My friend said my pupils were fully dilated the whole time. Once my sight was back I started feeling more like myself. 

I have no idea what happened. I later read that fat people shouldn’t be restrained with their hands above their head due to blood pressure issues, so I haven’t tried it again."
