NBA_Draft,fphmdnz,t3_gddyp3,1588623830.0,"Terry and not close to me. Markus is a terrific shot maker, maybe the best scorer in college basketball. That being said Terry gets to the rim more, is a significantly better defender, and passer. I have terry at 16. I haven’t finished my board yet but initial guess is Howard will be somewhere around 70-80. The height/length difference is huge. Terry is a good finisher too.


Ultimately for me the biggest issue with Howard is his lack of playmaking for others. It’s not that he’s a ball hog it’s that he doesn’t create advantage situations like PG’s do. So if he’s really a 5’11 non initiator what’s the value?"

NBA_Draft,fny4zrv,t1_fnxo3ca,1587353548.0,"Almost everyone looks good compared to Kawhi in college as a three point shooter. He’s a complete anomaly and his shooting development should be ignored when projecting other players. Okoro’s shot is a complete mess and needs a total rebuild. 

Not only does his shot need to be rebuilt but he himself needs to get the confidence in the shot. In conference play teams largely ignored him from the corner and he’d either turn down the shot or take it and brick it too often. I like the defense and passing but the rest of his offensive game is ugly. Think he’s a bench guy on a good team"

NBA_Draft,fnw3pnn,t3_g46506,1587310812.0,Vassell is a much better prospect imo. Okoro is a dreadful shooter and I’m not even sure he’s better on defense. Vassell is the best team defender in the entire draft
