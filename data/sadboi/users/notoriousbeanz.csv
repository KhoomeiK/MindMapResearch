teenagers,fqzckyj,t3_glrnob,1589764538.0,"No. Because there can be an instance where there’s an excess. Like if we are making NaCl, there can be an excess of an Na..... molecule for the amount of ....Cl molecules, and therefore the Na..... wouldn’t be all used up. Some would stay as that reactant. If that doesn’t make sense, you can also just think about it logically. Say you have the reactants of cereal and milk. They are separate things. But we can combine them to make a product of cereal in milk. If we have a box of cereal but an insane amount of milk (like a swimming pool full) then we would only need the amount of milk needed to be used for one box of cereal. The rest of the milk is excess and is of the same composition as your starting reactant. It doesn’t always happen though because maybe the ratios between the reactants are perfect."

mentalhealth,f99j52e,t3_e0ak98,1575191733.0,"That sounds comforting. Just a quick question, what is considered a crisis? My school has a crisis hotline and I’ve considered calling it but I end up talking myself out of it. I have a hard time opening up to people because I feel like my problems don’t matter and I occasionally feel like I’m screwing up so bad that I wish I could just press a reset button."
relationship_advice,f7q5193,t3_dxgxmj,1573958885.0,"Bro I read your other post. You both are 18. You might not be ready to get married. And also if she didn’t talk to you after you lost you’re job, it’s possible that you both aren’t mature enough for a lifetime commitment to each other. Why rush into things."
relationship_advice,f67rvp7,t3_dqovv8,1572722222.0,"That is really annoying. Honestly, his inability to control himself/listen to how you feel sounds like he’s treating you like an object. Firmly have a discussion with him where you tell him to grow the fuck up and respect your body and boundaries. And if he doesn’t, end it."

relationship_advice,ezns6fk,t3_d1n38b,1568010685.0,"I think you should tell your mom. I think it is very kind that you are trying to look out for your brother, but you already said there’s animosity between your parents and that isn’t incredibly healthy. If they get divorced, their relationship and how it affects your brother is not your fault."

AskReddit,esgxeff,t3_c7agc2,1561972041.0,"I don’t regret it, but I think it’s because I was anticipating it for a long long time. I talked to him online and was very careful about it. Like I didn’t trust him enough to tell him any personal information for awhile, until I was sure I had enough of a reason to trust him. I know that seems really bothersome but I was younger, I was paranoid about online predators or catfish. Anyway we ended up meeting 4 years later when I moved to college. I still talk to him everyday."
Advice,erm75yo,t1_erm57d0,1561008686.0,I know you won’t fully understand bcs it is confusing. But we are exclusive. We would be dating if we didn’t live far away. We plan to date in the future just not now. And we aren’t interested in dating other people. He’s the one who’s always like “I miss you” “I wish you were here” blah blah blah
