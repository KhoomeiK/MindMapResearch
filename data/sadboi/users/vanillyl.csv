Most people enjoy the taste of meat. Vegans don’t abstain from eating meat and animal products because they don’t like the taste. It’s a decision based on how unethical it is to kill and torture other sentient beings simply because we think their flesh tastes delicious. 

The meat, dairy, agricultural and fishing industries are egregiously cruel toward harmless living creatures who feel pain, who form emotional attachments and bonds; for example cows being separated from their babies as soon as they give birth. 

Being vegan is a decision based on feeling empathy toward animals and living things, and prioritising that over a thrill to the tastebuds."

We are aware when you look at us and just say, ‘unh huh,’ and then move on, talking to each other. You mean no harm, but you have no idea how alone we feel even when we are with you.”

>”So, what’s wrong with ‘retard’?,” he asked. “I can only tell you what it means to me and people like me when we hear it. It means that the rest of you are excluding us from your group.

It’s ended up being very much business as usual here in Australia, and the worst I’ve experienced is having non-urgent tests/scans postponed indefinitely. 

My heart goes out to those of you in the US who are in the thick of it right now. I know how scared I was just thinking that my regular care *could* be impacted. It’s hard being chronically ill. Really, really hard.

When you’re peeling a hard boiled eggs, you actually want a little bit of air to make it possible to separate the cooked white from the membraney bit on the inside of the shell. Otherwise the cooked white just sticks to it and it ends up all broken apart with fragments of shell stuck to it.

Use this time where all of us are staying home a lot more to experiment and get used to how it looks in a safe environment, then try it in public and see how it goes! I bet you get a tonne of compliments. 

But also, if you’re still uncomfortable? That’s ok too! You can like how bold lipstick looks and want to be able to do it, but you might just never like how it looks on you. Not every makeup look is for everyone and you don’t have to force yourself to do something you don’t like. I love contour but don’t like it on my own face.

AussieMakeupTrade,fjg7cpr,t1_fjg60yl,1583315012.0,Vs mascara by itself?
BeautyGuruChatter,fjg57vk,t3_fd0rt9,1583312035.0,"What a creative and articulate take on this. She pinpointed all of the little details that I couldn’t quite put my finger on about exactly what makes Jaclyn disingenuous. 

The saddest thing is, I went back and watched one of my favourite old Jaclyn videos from before she was...like this. She loves to jump on anybody saying ‘oh I miss the old Jaclyn’ and slay them for expecting anybody to stay the same, people change and grow, nobody’s the same at 29 as they were at 25, yadda yadda yadda. Skips right over the actual issue. 

An old video with Jaclyn? You felt like you were being taught an amazing skill in easy to follow, articulate, well-broken down steps, by somebody encouraging you to practice said skill and get better and who wanted you to succeed. She came across as warm, genuine, and relatable. Most importantly, she taught you things.

New video with Jaclyn? OH MY GOSH YOU GUYS MY LIFE IS SO AWFUL BUT I’M SUCH A POSITIVE PERSON I’M NOT LETTING IT GET ME DOWN, I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH, HERE’S A LIST OF 13 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD PITY ME AND BUY MY CHALKY PALETTE/FLUFFY SLUG STICKS/OVERPRICED GLITTER TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER BECAUSE DON’T YOU FEEL SORRY FOR MEEEEE?!

Bitch, people want the old Jaclyn back because she didn’t feel like a manipulative shill! Everybody changes in their 20’s yes, but if you change into a really shitty person, why the fuck would you think they’re going to be supportive of your crappy behaviour, let alone be happy about it?!"

AussieMakeupTrade,fjg0rpu,t1_fjg0nrt,1583306625.0,I’d be down for the brown one in that case. Can pick up/meet up in North Brissy too. :)

dataisbeautiful,fj6albp,t1_fj64dyq,1583064860.0,"Makes sense. QLD are a leader in both skin cancer rates (fucking crazy high non-melanoma, and high melanoma rates), and also obesity. We are...not a healthy state."
dataisbeautiful,fj6agsn,t1_fj65hmw,1583064697.0,"Man I just googled this and you’re right. QLD and TAS have the two worst obesity rates, and the two lowest average ages of death outside of NT, which the commenter above explained."
dataisbeautiful,fj621it,t1_fj5orwa,1583052836.0,"That’s fucking sad. Thanks for the explanation, I was wondering. What’s the deal with Queensland though? I thought perhaps mining being such a common and labour intensive occupation had something to do with it, but then saw that WA seems fine?"
scacjdiscussion,fj61dl9,t3_fbkrcl,1583051923.0,"Neutrogena hydro boost gel. It sinks in, absorbs immediately, and leaves no film or excess. The Ordinary moisturising factors + HA is good too, but has a more traditional moisturiser feel to it. Downside to both? No SPF. I’m yet to find a sunscreen that doesn’t just leave a thick layer of shine on my already deeply shiny face."

You’ll need to roll around like a Labrador afterward with the satisfaction that only comes from overeating amazing food. And fry bread, oh man. Just don’t try boil-up."

AskReddit,fj5djn6,t1_fj5aj5e,1583030109.0,"I’m a lactose intolerant vegetarian haha, I don’t really consume a whole heap of animal products (except when I suffer for enjoyment of cheese) so it’s nice to know I’m doing something right! I’ll definitely bear in mind trying to up my fibre intake - I used to be really good at keeping up with a high fibre diet but I’ve admittedly dropped off the wagon a bit with that. I totally need to up my game when it comes to probiotics too!

I’m so glad you found something that worked for you, totally understand them pushing you to the point your mental health suffers. I can’t imagine going a couple of *years* without one, that’s crazy!  

I found the same, in my 20’s I used to be able to take a couple of trimethoprim and they’d be gone in a day. Now in my 30’s I’m popping nitrofurantoin like they’re going out of fashion and as soon as I stop for a couple of days, bam, another UTI. Thank you so much for all the advice - doctors have never even suggested any advice to me that’s dietary in nature; I’m guessing because I’m pretty thin they probably assume I must eat well? It’s honestly so encouraging to hear your story and that there are potentially a whole bunch of preventative measures out there that stop the problem occurring in the first place, rather than just being thrown endless antibiotics and told to wipe front to back for the 80th time!"
OldSchoolCool,fj5c3eu,t1_fj4vvps,1583029154.0,"Eh, it goes in phases. Prior to Cindy’s era in the 80’s/90’s Twiggy was huge - 60’s/70’s models were very thin and waif like. Before that, 40’s/50’s hourglass pin-ups like Marilyn Monroe were all the rage. After Cindy, we had Kate Moss and the era where ‘heroin chic’ was idolised through the 90’s/200’s. From 2010 to now, we’re back to curvy being in but in a more extreme way - big butts, thighs and busts. I’d say come 2030 we’re probably going to see it swing back to an ultra skinny aesthetic."
AskReddit,fj593du,t1_fj2rlrj,1583027136.0,Oh really? How so? Is it by way of more intense UTI’s?!
