My personal favorites are generally Argentine Malbecs, which are a little on the dry side, but not overly so. For beer, try ciders first since they're sweeter and easier to drink if you're not used to alcohol. From ciders try moving to saisons or sour beers since they're very similar to ciders, just not fruit based. IPAs will likely be unpleasant (very bitter and skunky),  so stay away from them until you're more comfortable with other less sweet styles of beer.

Most shows on HBO are going to be things you want to see (Game of Thrones). Idk if you guys are up to date, but Tiger King is a WILD ride of a Netflix series. Shameless was really good, as is The Expanse on Amazon if y'all are into SciFi (bonus cameo of Mormons)."
