Anxiety,fo34yb4,t3_fj2y1a,1587480634.0,"I have been waiting to comment this for a little while.

We got news about 2 weeks ago that my 80 year old grandmother's nursing home had some residents test positive for COVID. Then we were told her unit (dementia unit) had people test positive. Then, she had a slight fever for 2 shifts in a row- and we were told she would be tested. She tested positive. 

Naturally, I was an anxious mess. This subreddit helped me through some of it. 

Here's the thing, though: her symptoms remained SO mild, that if she weren't in the nursing home where people had tested positive, she probably would have flown under the radar as asymptomatic. She had a slight fever for 2 shifts on that first day before she was tested- then she hasn't had a fever since then. No coughing, no aches, nothing. She has had a slightly reduced appetite, and seems to be a bit more confused than normal (her dementia is pretty severe though, and it's hard for me to really know what that would look like). The other thing is that I am sure all of their daily routines have been totally upended during this, and that can't be helping.

Obviously this is really serious, especially for the elderly, and I do not mean to undermine that fact- but the point is that even among that population, the death rate is relatively low, and this is not a death sentence.

Anyway, tl, dr: My 80 year old grandmother with dementia and a heart condition tested positive for COVID and was virtually asymptomatic."

Fauci speculates Americans could take summer vacations, but there are caveats
By Madeline Holcombe, Jason Hanna and Amanda Watts, CNN

(CNN)Americans have the potential to take summer vacations this year -- provided that the country continues aggressive mitigation efforts now and gets to a place where it can modify them, the nation's top infectious disease official said Thursday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci's comment comes amid a tension between desires to gradually open the economy and maintaining the social distancing measures that experts say will hold down deaths only if those policies continue.

On ""CBS This Morning"" Thursday, Fauci was asked if he could envision a typical summer with vacations, baseball games, weddings and family reunions.
""It can be in the cards,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CBS.

But, he warned: ""When we pull back and try to open up the country ... we have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again,"" the country has a way to aggressively and effectively ""identify, isolate, contract trace and make sure we don't have those spikes we have now.""
Moving toward normalcy will be gradual, and could be different by region, he said.

""Hopefully, by the time we get to the summer, we will have taken many steps in that direction"" that would allow some normalization."

7:30 a.m.: 'There is a light at the end of this tunnel,' US surgeon general says


While still maintaining that this will be a difficult week for Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Tuesday that he feels ""a lot more optimistic"" as he reassured citizens ""there is a light at the end of this tunnel.""

""I absolutely believe this is going to be an incredibly sad and an incredibly hard week for our country, but we've had tough times in this country before and we always come out stronger,"" Adams told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos in an interview on ""Good Morning America.""

""The good news is that when you look at Italy, when you look at Spain, when you look at Washington and California, and even New York and New Jersey, they have truly started to flatten their curves,"" he added. 

""They've seen cases level off and start to come down, and that's what I want people to understand -- that it's going to be a hard and tough week, but the American people have the power to change the trajectory of this epidemic if we come together like we have after past tragedies in this country.""

Adams said the latest data shows U.S. states like Washington and California have successfully flattened the curves of their outbreaks ""because they were aggressively mitigating from the start."""
