First, while cheating isn't right, it is more sympathetic when people are in unfair situations, like being forced by family pressures to marry someone they don't love.

Then, I got the impression that Rory and Logan's Vegas arrangement pre-dated their relationships, which is why it didn't ""feel"" like cheating to them. Casual relationships would come and go, but they would always have each other, kind of more like an open relationship. Logan gets more serious with Odette as the revival marched on, and Rory is obviously surprised by that. It's clear she didn't initially expect Logan/Odette to last, so her arc is not ""cheating, then stopping"" - it's realizing he's not her long-distance boyfriend having an allowed fling with another girl, and he's ""really going to marry her."" (This is the point of Rory getting upset at the idea of being ""like his mistress"" - she doesn't feel like the other woman, she feels like the main woman who's just really understanding about other girls).

I also thought it was super clear that Rory and Logan's fall tryst was their last time, and her rejecting his housing offer was refusing to be his mistress.

And with Paul, I personally think he was in the same boat as Rory - not actually into her, but relucant to officially break it off. He might like the idea of a relationship, but he doesn't notice or mind that she's not into him, doesn't seem to be trying to see or contact her during their year apart, and he ultimately has no qualms breaking up with her via text (a short, terse text, with no emotion or details).  That sounds like someone who wants to be able to say they have a girlfriend without actually doing any relationship things."

When Liz arrives, she reveals a much more traumatic history - terrible boyfriends who she kept thinking were ""the one"", one who died, others who emptied her bank account and robbed her apartment, and left her sobbing to Luke to help find new housing fast.

*Liz* tells us she had to cut out pot to keep from messing up her life, needs her future husband to stop her from overindulging in alcohol, and binge-drank while pregnant.

Also, look at their actions!  Liz and TJ take over Luke's apartment to have a loud fight. When she gets pregnant she kicks TJ out by physically abusing him (throwing heavy objects at his head) and then goes and lies to Luke and says he left. She also can't do basic things like cook dinner by herself, and apparently jewelry-making is the first stable job she's had? No way was Jess getting his needs met.

Everything Liz says about her past confirms that Jess's upbringing was, at best, unstable, neglectful, and marked with scary incidents - that alone is traumatic.  It doesn't have to be abuse, but Liz being friendly and cheerful doesn't mean he wasn't abused by her or someone else, at all.

Also, I can't stress enough how gross and victim-blaming is it to call ""acting traumatized"" lying about abuse. Forget Jess and put yourself in a victim's shoes.

But a full degree program means taking a bunch of classes he doesn't want in subjects he doesn't care about, from teachers he may not respect, with students he finds stupid, and this is where high school frustrated him most.

I don't agree that he'd need a degree to thrive in indy publishing, but if he did, virtual programs might be his best choice since he can avoid people, crank out his work at a faster pace, and control his own schedule.

That was totally unfair to him, and kind of proves his point about why he was reluctant to tell her about April - Lorelai steamrolls him all the time, and doesn't always respect his boundaries.

He absolutely should have told her about April sooner, and done a better job of juggling his relationships with them.  But I don't think he was wrong for asking to call off the wedding.

Lorelai wanted to wait for her relationship with Rory to be sorted out.  Him wanting time to navigate the tricky situation with Anna and build a real rapport with April is no different.  Also, Lorelai offered to call off the wedding because he was feeling stressed about it - he should be allowed to tell his partner how he really feels.

Lorelai also goes to lengths to hide how she's feeling - getting the whole town to lie about her meltdown, sleeping at Sookie's, and telling him she's fine until she suddenly isn't.

His biggest mistake, IMO, is when she came to him distraught and demanding to elope.  He basically shuts down and gives her nothing.  Even if he wasn't ready to marry her on the spot, he could've closed the diner, taken her to dinner, had a long talk about their feelings, figured out how to approach Anna, and set a new freaking date."

Dean also presented himself as a bit of a bookish bad boy with a cavalier attitude when Rory was first getting to know him, so I think you could say that's her type too, in spite of that not really being him.

Beyond that, I think there's lots of overlaps between any two of them, but not all 3.

Logan and Dean are social, friendly, and rather extroverted. They're very direct and in-touch with their feelings, and pro-active in the relationship.  Jess is more reserved, and introverted, and often leaves the relationship ball in Rory's court (even when he chases her, it's usually just to push the ball back to her - this is one of their ""too similar to work"" problems - they both want to be chased).

Jess and Logan both have a playful prankster streak, and a bad boy reputation, and are a bit troubled due to daddy issues, whereas Dean doesn't display any these traits. Logan and Jess are also both very sharp intellectually and well read enough to keep up with Rory and even challenge her.

On the other hand, Dean and Jess are the only two who actually make bonding over pop culture a core part of their relationship with Rory. They get genuinely excited about books/bands/movies and swap book recs.  Logan's read big books, but he never geeks out over them or delights in reading like Rory and Jess do (or like Dean tries to) or get excited over movies/bands - he's into experiences. 

Jess and Dean are also both very hard-working, working long hours at multiple blue-collar jobs as teenagers. YMMV on Logan since his situation is different, but I wouldn't describe him that way."

ufyh,fqrzurk,t3_gkks70,1589595451.0,Amazing! I'm so proud of you!
GilmoreGirls,fqrz9p8,t1_fqrxzmp,1589595087.0,"Nice deflection, but everyone you interact with is a real person, and you attacked stances - things real, non-fictional people believe or feel - in incredibly nasty and disparaging terms.

You also said things that were ahistorical to the point of being objectively untrue, and it isn't rude to tell the truth about that.

But having seen your post history, the weird Gilmore Girls hate sub you run, I think it's best I block you, and spare myself the toxicity you are clearly trying to stir up here."
GilmoreGirls,fqrxmum,t1_fqrsu2c,1589594079.0,"> i have a right to my opinion too

Lol, you made a post calling it cowardly and ungrateful to disagree with you, and my post is saying that it's not."
GilmoreGirls,fqrsjx0,t3_gkizdq,1589590991.0,"More like he can distinguish between real people who fought for something and silly people who dress up to feel special.  Don't get me wrong, dressing up is a perfectly fun hobby, but it's not anything more than that.

Also... are you a child? I don't want to make you feel bad if you are, but your view of history is really narrow and lacking nuance if you think a bunch of wealthy British guys being mad about money is the ""height"" of rebellion when there's a ton of slave revolts and native rebellions that drove out colonizers. Like, you know the American revolutionaries promised slaves their freedom if they fought in the war and then didn't honor that promise, right? You know that they passed a bunch of regressive laws taking rights *away* from women? You know they stole and raped and murdered Indigenous people?

You aren't ungrateful or cowardly if you think they're shit, and you definitely aren't ungrateful or cowardly if you think dressing up like them is stupid."
GilmoreGirls,fqrqtyn,t1_fqrim8d,1589589949.0,"Exactly - I think over the years they built up the idea of ""them"" in their head.  Whenever things were hard or they got unhappy, the ""what if we had"" was there."
butchwomen,fqrqcia,t1_fqrgrwr,1589589659.0,"That's good advice.  I'll try to remember it.

I'm in an apartment and my window faces the parking lot, but I might make a sign anyway, and dressing up sounds fun. I'm sure there will be social media tags to put selfies in at least."
GilmoreGirls,fqrq2aa,t1_fqrgjw1,1589589487.0,"I don't see how Chris's feelings would determine whether or not she told Logan. Being told isn't really an issue with Chris - he knew and chose not to be involved. Knowing why he didn't try to be more involved might help if her goal is to get Logan to be choose to be involved, but I think her situation is just stirring up her feelings, making her want answers for her own closure, because his absence hurt her.

But yes, I would definitely want Luke's arc in AYITL2 to be a Grandpa who babysits a lot so he can have the fun parts of being a parent *and* the joy of sending the kid back to their parents when he wants peace and quiet."

GilmoreGirls,fqqyrzs,t3_gkb314,1589574416.0,"Rory had every intention of going to Lorelai's graduation - she missed it because she didn't realizes some buses would be slower than the one she took to get there, and because the interstate was blocked.

Yeah, skipping school to hop a bus out of state was impulsive, but she didn't decide to miss the graduation, it was a fluke accident."
GilmoreGirls,fqqy0vr,t1_fqq5da9,1589574023.0,"They're asking about this scene, from Emily in Wonderland.

> RACHEL: Well this was originally his dad's office, so it was never really meant for anyone to actually live in.

> LORELAI: But tell that to Luke.

> RACHEL: Exactly.

> LORELAI: Do you think about moving to a bigger place?

> RACHEL: I don't think so.

> LORELAI: No? Oh right. Because tight quarters, romantic. Hello Lorelai.

> RACHEL: Yeah, well I don't think romance has a lot to do with it.

> LORELAI: No?

> **RACHEL: I'm not sure I'm gonna be in Stars Hollow much longer.**

> LORELAI: Oh. But I thought. . .

> **RACHEL: I know, I just, I can't seem to make Luke believe that I really want to stay this time.**

> LORELAI: Did you tell him all that stuff you told me?

> RACHEL: Till I was blue in the face.

> LORELAI: Well you just have to keep trying until he hears you.

Then, a little later she adds:

> RACHEL: Hey, I know this is not so not cool to ask. But if the situation comes up and it's not too weird, a little word of encouragement from you might help a lot."
GilmoreGirls,fqqx1ac,t1_fqq2xii,1589573504.0,"I can't believe you're getting downvoted for being right.

Actually I can."
GilmoreGirls,fqqwhxp,t1_fqq2s4x,1589573221.0,"That comes later. Several episodes before, Rachel tells Lorelai she might not stick around because Luke doesn't trust she won't take off, and asks Lorelai to put in a good word for Luke. (while they're exploring the Dragonfly property.)

Then Lorelai invades Luke's store room and plays with his fun cutty thing (e.g.boxcutter) and she tells him Rachel seems sincere and he should trust her. Then they all wind up at the movies, and later Rachel tells Lorelai thanks because now Luke is more committed and gave her a drawer.

ETA: Everyone who downvoted u/NicoleKasey for remembering what actually happened in the show is a fragile baby who sucks."
GilmoreGirls,fqqvqjz,t3_gkbnaj,1589572822.0,"Under her cool girl exterior, Rachel is actually a very impatient person with very black or white thinking.

In her mind, Luke is either all in or all out, and nothing she can do will change that.  Any wariness or reluctance to trust her is interpreted as proof he's lost to her forever.  The idea that she might need to earn his trust by putting down roots (getting her own apartment, looking for a local job, etc...) and giving him time never even occurs to her.

I really get the impression she thought of him as on standby - a constantly available boyfriend who'd happily welcome her if she ever wanted to settle down. And when he isn't that, she acts like he isn't an option at all any more, so there's no point wasting her time in town."

latebloomerlesbians,fqq06g6,t3_gk8re4,1589557132.0,"This is how I felt a few years ago too (I'm 35 now) but once I started spending more time in the community, I realized there's lots of older lesbians here, and new people coming out everyday at all ages. Especially IRL, where I think I'm the youngest woman in my lesbian meetup group, and there are even activities exclusively for older LGBT people like 50+ brunches.

We're not alone, we're just less visible online."
GilmoreGirls,fqpz4lg,t1_fqpwvl9,1589556599.0,"Not true.  Both of those things are very impressive to admissions.

Student government is fairly exclusive (everyone and their mother is not on student government, lol, it usually only has a handful of actual roles; Rory was VP - an important leadership position). Student newspaper looks great because it's a lot of regular, hard work, especially if it's a prestigious paper (like the Franklin) and if (like Rory) you can point out you've been trusted to write a lot of big features and edit others' work.

Colleges don't just count the number of activities you do, they also look at how often you meet and how long you were involved in them.

Two extracurriculars like these that meet every week (sometimes more) for the whole school year, plus a handful of other less frequent activities (like the town fundraisers she helps with every couple of episodes) is exactly what colleges want to see."
GilmoreGirls,fqpwrxu,t3_gk8kcm,1589555398.0,"No, I think they're mostly just flawed people with strengths and weaknesses.  I think some people get in a fault-finding rut on this sub, but they're not generally worse than any other characters."
GilmoreGirls,fqpwmui,t1_fqputj4,1589555324.0,"She was on student government and the school newspaper. Plus, she was super involved in Stars Hollow events, many of which were technically charity fundraisers.  

College prep schools are pretty good at teaching students how to spin their passtimes into impressive activities for college applications - I wouldn't be surprised if her final application included ""every year my mom and I make basket lunches to raise money for our town"" as charity work."
GilmoreGirls,fqpw0ex,t3_gka4oh,1589554997.0,"Yeah. They have very similar criteria, so if you're good enough to get into one, your odds of getting into several others go way up.

Rory had almost everything they could want in an applicant - top grades at a rigorous prep school, impressive extracurriculars (student government, the Franklin), great SAT scores, a specific career goal, and a compelling personal story (raised poor by a single teen mom). On top of that, she probably had great essays and glowing recommendations from teachers, plus Richard's alumni status at Yale."
