They won’t be there when I have yet another migraine and can’t get out of bed. So, when the rush of having someone pay attention to me in that way goes away, I always feel even more empty than before.

relationship_advice,fpapgim,t3_gc58hz,1588452980.0,"You don’t have to get married. Ever. It’s great if you want to get married but not getting married is a perfectly normal way to live life. Just wanted you to know that it is an option. 

It sounds like you already know that rushing into a (what should be) lifelong commitment sounds risky and it is. So, trust your instincts on this. 

Marriage is constant work and a lot of people don’t exactly know what that means until things are falling apart. So, it’s really important to find someone who makes your team better instead of worse. 

All kinds of things need to align for a marriage to be happy. Work ethic, religion, care giving, communication, cleanliness, hygiene, finances, home management, etc., and don’t forget romance. 

So, I guess my point is that the decision to get married shouldn’t be taken lightly and the person you choose to spend your life joined to should be someone special. If it turns out to be a soulmate then great! You’ve won the lottery! But, chances are they will be a great person who makes you happy, checks all the right boxes, and doesn’t make you want to stab them."

DeadBedrooms,fp6nw95,t3_gbl7su,1588355566.0,"I did the survey and I found some of the questions difficult to answer. It seemed like the questions were trying to gage how I react to ED but the answer to the question is very dependent on the how the person with ED feels about the ED. 

I’ve been with a guy in the past who would lose erection during sex sometimes because of the anti anxiety and anti depressants he was on. But, he had a good attitude about it and would continue doing wonderful things to me in bed, just using hands and mouth, so it wasn’t even an issue. I never thought about his ED as a problem because he cared about my enjoyment. I didn’t look at him as less or as a disappointment. He’s not even on my list of bad lays. 

But, my current issue (almost past issue as things are ending) is this guy doesn’t even want sex so it’s more than just ED. It’s a complete lack of desire. I have an issue with the absence of intimacy, not the absence of erection. So, I have zero issue if you can’t get your member hard as long as you still want to be intimate and have that connection with me."
