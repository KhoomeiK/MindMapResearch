socialskills,fqznjc1,t3_gllosj,1589771139.0,"Ok, this reply was probably WAY more than you were asking for, but I hope it helps somehow!

First off, I completely hear what you are saying because I've been where you are feeling those exact things. Trust me, I went from a traumatized, suicidal, nonexistent GPA, drug addict in high school who thought my mistakes in during those years would define the rest of my entire life, to a 4.0 college student on my way to becoming a psychologist with a few wonderful close friends, which is more than I could have ever dreamed of back just three years ago when I graduated high school. Seriously, if you told me I'd be where I am today back then I would have laughed right in your face. I really do understand what it's like to be in high school and think that what happens there will define your life, but I PROMISE you it that absolutely does not. I started my freshman year of high school with a few friends and left with literally none because my already lacking social skills were obliterated during that time due to some life stuff. I promise you that once you've graduated you will look back on those 4 years and wonder why you thought they mattered so much and why everything in them seemed so incredibly big. I never used to believe people when they would say stuff like that but here I am just a few years outside of 18 and high school literally feels like an entire lifetime ago. 

Something that I have learned along the way is that there is really nothing to ""catch up"" to. Society has done an excellent job of ingraining this idea in us that we all have to hit certain milestones, interact in a certain way, develop a certain number of friends, etc. by a certain time or there is something inherently wrong with us. But, in reality, we are all unique human beings with unique backgrounds, communication needs, personalities, attachment styles, methods of expression, and life paths that are impossible to fit into a singular path or pattern. Just because you doesn't seem to fir into other how people operate does not mean that you are doing things wrong or are behind in any way.

Now people just becoming magically ""better"" in college is a total myth. The phenomenon of some people feeling like they just happened to find themselves in college is largely due to the massive shift in personal freedom, ability to make your own choices, distance from environmental stressors in family, high school, etc., engagement in subjects of individualized interests, and a bunch of other factors that naturally foster identity development that comes with college. But as someone who is in college I can tell you that seemingly magical personal awakening only really happens to a small fraction of people. Plenty of people in college struggle socially and feel like they don't fit in! 

The truth is that to make real change in any area of your life you have to put in the hard work for it and for a lot of people (speaking from experience) it is a lot easier to stagnate in sadness or excuses than to do the often very uncomfortable and very difficult things that are necessary to create lasting personal change. To start, you have to accept that you are not where you want to be right now, but not let that realization cripple you. Through acceptance of where you are you can take a good look at why you are not where you want to be. Then you can figure out what specific things are making you feel ""behind"" and determine the underlying reasons for why those things are causing you to feel that way. I personally find it helpful to brainstorm and then physically write down each specific factor in myself or my life that I currently dislike and then map out what motivates my dislike for those things. If you discover that your motivation to change a negative aspect of your life is motivated by someone else or outside pressure, drop it. Don't look at it again because it's impossible to live up to other people's needs or outside comparisons and following that won't take you where you want to be. Focus on the things that are motivated by something that YOU think changing would improve YOUR satisfaction with your life. Next, figure out what small steps you can take to make change possible in those areas. Map out a realistic path from right now to achievement of goal. A goal is best achieved when broken down into small, attainable pieces that push you slightly out of your comfort zone without being debilitating. For example, if you struggle with social anxiety then make a point to go for a short walk once a week and wave at two people you see in your neighborhood. Just two (or whatever seems one more than you think you can handle right now). If school is in-person again you could translate that to the hallway instead. Then next week bump it up to three, etc. If you're farther along than that, then setting a goal like striking up a conversation with one new person each week (a cashier, on the bus, an old friend over text, the person sitting next to you in class etc.) might be a better goal.  Just play around with it and see what fits for you. Remember that you are practicing a skill so things will go good and they undoubtedly WILL go bad sometimes and consequently make sure to take it easy on yourself. You wouldn't demean someone who is trying to loose weight for not being able to pump out 50 perfect push ups at the start of their journey right? So don't do the same thing to yourself. You're learning and the point is that you're trying which  means you are making forward progress towards something that you have determined will improve your life. And that's awesome! Even if it's two steps forward and one back for a very long time, you're moving and that's something to be really proud of.

Also, remember that so many people out there don't care about how they come across to others or how they interact with others. The fact that you clearly do (even though I know it feels like a massive burden to care) is an amazing quality that will serve the depth of your connections, friendships and relationships well in the future even if you can't see it right now. It's a unique aspect of who you are and you just have to practice directing properly. Take your time and don't put arbitrary deadlines like college on yourself. You're on your own path and following that alone is all that matters and the only thing that will make you truly happy in the end. I apologize for rambling and I hope this might help. Either way, best of luck to you! You've got this!"

tattoos,fq6a0k7,t3_ggk83h,1589127493.0,I’m surprised at how much hate this sleeve is getting! It’s one of the first that actually made me stop and say “wow that’s so awesomely different” in awhile. Maybe I’m biased because I love sleeves with negative space but I think it is pieced together really well for the unique subject matter and I love the whimsical style of it. We all have different tastes and it’s fine not to like it but I hope OP doesn’t let some of these comments get him down because this sleeve is awesome!
college,fpdd07p,t3_gcru75,1588524571.0,"I totally understand! I was doing really well in my classes until the cocktail of COVID and finals hit together. The hardest part is just to sit down and get it done.

What I do is set a timer for 20-40 minutes and during that time I FORCE myself to work on an essay, project, study for a test, etc with absolutely no distractions. After that time I take a break. What usually happens is once I take that step to start working on something for a few minutes I get into the flow of work and it gets much easier to make myself return to whatever it was I was working on after a break. If I can’t get into what I’m studying or writing during that time, I still make myself try and at least I’ll get something done even if it was just a few sentences or a few notecards and then try again after a snack or a walk. 

Also I agree with other posters here! If you have supportive parents or friends give them a call and chat before you get started on your work. Clean up your room, answer your emails, do whatever else may cause you peripheral stress first so that come into work with a little clearer mind and positive emotions from getting other things done. 

I know it’s hard, but you’ve got this! You already worked SO hard to get to the end of the semester and you’re almost done!"

depression,fon7itq,t1_fon6ntc,1587913928.0,"It does not earn you a job and experience is 10x more important HOWEVER:

Experience only in a job position that requires a degree of some kind =/= job. (*Most of the time, there are always exceptions to the rule) 

It’s a two fold approach. Your degree gets you in the door and your experience gets you the job. 

So what I am saying is, telling people not to get a degree is a misguided approach as (at least where I live) it’s is a requirement to get hired regardless of your experience. It’s a box they have to check off in order to offer you the position. So getting a degree AND experience are both important (in MOST cases). Not one or the other. 

There are always exceptions where you, or your cousins, or your friend got a job based off only experience and that’s awesome! But for the majority of cases you have to have a degree just to say you have one. It’s a shitty system but that’s how it currently functions, so telling people not to get a degree is misguided in my opinion"
depression,fon4y7k,t1_fon2zib,1587912329.0,Actually that is exactly what a degree does? At least in my state having a BS or BA of ANY kind opens up a massive amount of job opportunities that pay much better wages than just a high school diploma. It’s almost impossible to get a job that pays a livable wage here without having a 4-year degree in something.

TLCsisterwives,flauhmm,t1_fl9pcxv,1584991377.0,"I’m a psych student: Bipolar I only requires presence of manic episodes while Bipolar II requires the presence of manic and depressive episodes. 

I can completely see Cody as either Bipolar I or BPD comorbid with attributes of NPD. He literally can never settle and flies off on these sudden huge “god-driven” plans that make absolutely no sense. The frantic nature of the move to Flagstaff for literally NO reason and at the detriment of his family really screamed manic episode to me. He doesn’t seem to go into true depressive episodes (from what we can see) but an attribute of BPD is viewing things and people through extremely idealistic lenses when things are going well and then demonizing them in your mind when something goes wrong, with little grey area in between (something we’ve seen him do a TON this season with both his feelings about his wives and his sudden sullen attitude towards the polygamist beliefs he’s spent the past 800 episodes raving about now that things aren’t going his way). 

Obviously it’s impossible to diagnose someone who we only see edited snippets of, but at least from what we can see and have seen over the years there’s been enough evidence to make a fairly strong case for the presence of either Bipolar I or BPD.

(Im not an expert though, just a student and could definitely be wrong!)"

Anxiety,fkw9ioy,t1_fku3trf,1584586652.0,"Yes! A little over 6 months ago I broke up with my toxic fiancé who was the last in a string of abusive relationships spanning several years, am in therapy and really thriving for the first time since I was very very young. Just a few days before this all went crazy I was just so happy thinking about the future and all the possibility’s in front of me for the first time in my life and then BAM. Pandemic, quarantine, economy crashing, mine and my family’s jobs now hanging in the balance. 

Everyday the prognosis for the length of this and overall impact of it seems to grow worse and worse. I’m trying really hard to not be disheartened and I know it’s selfish but the timing of it just really sucks. I wish I could have held on to that good feeling and those dreams a little bit longer but now everything is so uncertain. Who knows what life will look like in 3 months not to mention a year from now. 

I’m just trying to be grateful for things like food, running water, electricity and internet, proximity to my family, etc. It’s hard but I have to remind myself that it could be worse and there’s literally nothing I can control but how I respond to this. 

Best wishes to you, we will get through this."
