WestlandSurvival,fniksj4,t3_g1bpad,1586981717.0,"Like  u/[ExtraWoodpecker1](https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtraWoodpecker1/) said, collect all alcohol and water bottles you can find at any time, you're gonna need A LOT once you start making your potions and ointments. One of my biggest regrets is ignoring them thinking I have a lot.

Clothes are a good idea when in challenging places because even when depleted, they still offer some armour points.

I have a few other tips as well:

\- Regarding being attacked by 4 at a time, sometimes when there'es a group of outlaws gathered i approach very very slowly trying to lure one at a time to give myself a better opportunity at fighting. Doesn't work in all situations.

\- The gifts you get through watching advertisement are always worth it.

\- Don't always empty your inbox from tools and food/drinks/medicine. You might need them once you're out somewhere and out of whatever it is.

\- Medicinal herbs and Agastache and Plantago are always better when turned into bandages. I would recommend turning them just into bandages and not infusions/potions until you get your laboratory workbench, and start storing potions once you're close to building the lab. If a medicinal herb gives you 30 HP, using one herb with a cloth turns it into a bandage of 60 HP, but you need 3 herbs to make an infusion/potion of 120 HP, which could've been used to make 3 bandages worth 180 HP. Hope that makes sense.

\- Sometimes if you don't have enough storage for like wood for example, turning it into planks and other products saves storage since each plank would use 3 wood pieces. 

\- If you log in every day, the prizes are worth it. You even get VIP once every couple of weeks I think, which helps you level up faster if you play on the day you have VIP. (that is, if you don't wanna pay)

\- Gun powder is a good way to get alcohol from the dealer as well.

\- Don't waste your good weapons and clothes on green areas. 

\- When your gun is almost out of ammunition, don't let it break. You can repair it at the workbench and save resources.

\- At some point throughout the game outlaws are going to attack your base. You will be notified beforehand. I've had three or four attacks so far. You don't have to worry about the first two at all, the first attack they run away when you're at your base, and the second attack they just damaged my wooden stake thingies haha.

If you place your player at the base and exit the game, I read that they won't attack until you reopen the game. You can chase and kill them off at your base, which gets you a map to an unprotected base (go naked with zero weapons, you only have to kill one watchman with 100 HP and so you can just punch him).

I think it is unnecessary to pay for a game, since after all it's just a game and money can always be better spent elsewhere. I've had the game for less than a month and I'm up to level 52, and I don't play it that religiously. 

 I don't think using all points for spirit points till level 45 is a good idea to be honest. At least give yourself a liiiittle defense and attack speed and strength as well. But this does not mean spirit points are not important. They are great to reduce your chances of a wild animal attacking you, as well as taming one to protect you when outside.

Good luck!"

I just think ""okay I'll just make it through this hour"" and try to keep that going every time an hour passes. Distractions can help take your mind off it temporarily, like watching shows or listening to music or baking or talking to someone. That's how I deal with the urges sometimes. Other times I just lie down on the bathroom floor with music and try to focus on breathing. I know this isn't a solution I'm sorry but it does help me sometimes. Some people recommend therapy as well but that isn't always an available option."
