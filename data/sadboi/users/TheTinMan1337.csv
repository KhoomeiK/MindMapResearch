Not saying that you would but def could complicate things in several ways down the line. With that being said your young and i personally would chance it. Especially if you have only slept with one person. Chances are statistically speaking she wont be the one you marry. Sex is important and imo sex with several different people throughout your life before making a life long commitment is crucial. I would go for it but if your not comfortable then dont get pressured into it. This is a call only you can make.

The cold hard truth tho is staying in shape and living healthier is alot of work you cant do for him. People dont like talking about this but the truth about weight loss is you need to eat less and move more. Unless you have thyroid issues ect. Even then tho people will look for excuses to try and not better themselves. I work a physical job and lift 5 days a week and finish with cardio after that watch what i eat and am still slightly over weight. Im on medications that promote weight gain (seroquel and lamictal). Its frustrating having to dig as deep as i do everyday and not be in the look of ""really fit"". Im 6'1 210 lbs. I should be ideally 180. Is what it is.  Food addiction is no joke and very deadly and hard to beat as you seem to know. Medications arent going to just fix his problem. He is prob right its a waste of money at this point because he isnt doing the most important thing and thats loving himself. My advice to you is try and find ways to make him love himself again. It sounds like hes a good dude and you have alot of material that can help you with that. If he starts loving himself he will start wanting to better himself. Then with proper diet, exercise and maybe some meds he can build off that. Best of luck to you and your family. Much love."

Instead of looking at what i recommended besides a psych and meds (meditation ect)  you chose to be a victim again. Is what it is. Ive learned alot of people fall into the victim trap of the disorder and others choose to be warriors and focus on solutions and positivity. Its not all bad. Clearly how your handling certain things are tho. If your looking for pitty as a grown woman who apparently knows the ins and outs of this thing you arent gonna get it from me.

BipolarReddit,fq163v2,t1_fq11my5,1589042270.0,"A few other things in addition. Im gonna give you my back story to help justify a few points i have in concern to the well being in your life. Was a point in my life i thought i had everything a man could want. A wonderful career with something i enjoy, an 8 year relationship with someone i loved to my core and asked to marry me, my own place, nice car, wonderful friends and family that i was extremely close with. Ive always known im very individualistic (most voted in highschool) and somethings always been alittle different with the way i am and think. I started having very bad temper issues and insane amounts of energy and all the other things. I decided to go to my doctor and ask him about my concerns. He told me i had some deoression and anxiety and wrote me a sssri and colazepam and sent me on my way. Fast forward about six months and i was a maniac. My temper was to a new level and i was miserable. My fiance ended up leaving me and i ended up going down a road i would wish on very very few people. Dove head first into the drug world (crystal benzos opiates alcohol) and within a year i went from having everything i ever wanted that i thought i would never get in a million years to having nothing and no1. I lost my career, my place, my fiance, totaled 2 vehichles, did horrible things to people, lost my freedom and mainly lost myself. After being court ordered to go to rehab or more jail or chose rehab and a requirement there was to talk to a psychiatrist. After a thorough evaluation he looked at me and said has anyone ever disgnosed or told you ya might be bi polar? I was dumb founded, i thought nah noway. Within anotyer half an hour discussion with him simply trying to figure out how he came to this conclusion and me trying to find a way he was wrong i couldnt. Everything made sense in away and i had no arguement to his diagnosis. Im bi polar 1 and was mis diagnosed from a general doctor and put on medications i never should of been on that made my symptoms 10 fold. He instantly took me off my anti deppresants, i detoxed from my benzo addiction along other substances and got on a med regiment that works for me ( that took some time figuring out). My point of telling you all this isnt to tell you that you are bi polar or arent bi polar. What im saying is whoever you voice these concerns to needs to be a professional in mental health and mental health alone. I highly recommend finding a good psychiatrist and having him do a very thorough evaluation on you. Anyway bro much love and best of luck. One way or the other it will work out if you want it to."
BipolarReddit,fq11my5,t3_ggh7s2,1589040550.0,We share alot of things in common. Im on a very small does of seroquel at night. 25mgs. Im also on lamiktal with that in addition. Seroquel has really helped my lamiktal give it alittle more of a sedation edge and i couldnt be happier with the combo. Im alittle more groggy in morning for a half hour but ill take that over not sleeping or shitty sleep any day of the week. I wouldnt suggest seroquel for just sleep tho. Im bi polar 1 and its seemed to help in other ways also with calmness and swings. Much love dog my heart goes out to you. Not sleeping can way on depression and alot of things. I dont miss that at all. Best of luck. With a psychiatrist you will figure out what works for you. Itll get better.

BipolarReddit,fpy83hp,t1_fpxpu77,1588998099.0,Ya while on the substances not arroused. Once i got it up no differences. If i had to guess its def one of the chems your on. If you can get it up though its not the end of the world. Youll be aight bro. Not worth not being stable if that combo works for you imo. If you couldnt get it up that would be different. Everyones different with what bothers them. Something you need to discuss with your doctor. Also if he says thats just a normal thing men deal with without chemicals ive never experienced it sober ( unless im working out) once my heart rate calms and ive settled down from working out everything goes back to normal. Idk homie im not a doctor and idk anything about blood flow to organs or the package. Never hurts to get a second opinion or ask for a specialist ect.
relationship_advice,fpxo2ib,t3_gg0519,1588986197.0,Not trying to be mean but your old enough to know. Maybe you shouldnt of married him?

If he wants to track mud through it and that bothers you then clean it up. I see both sides. I think he is being a dick and if it were me i would listen to you. That being said its not me and its the guy you decided to marry. Money changes people. You yourself even agreed to that. This is one of those it is what it is deals. Best of luck. Next time you get married maybe look for other appealing things such as character and place them as a priority higher then ya ill move in you got a big house. Just my 2 cents. Best of luck.

relationship_advice,fpx07dj,t3_gfthdz,1588973195.0,Find a new bf. Plenty of dudes will please you in the way you deserve. Its not shallow its a very very important part of a relationship. Same advice goes to guys. Why deal with a bad sex life when chances are mathematically you can find someone you get along with better and have better sex with? The fear of being alone i suppose. Ive broken up with a girl i honestly loved because we didnt vibe sexually. I would lie to say for a small time after i didnt regret that decision. Now after many more relationships some being semi serious and some just for sex i couldn't be happier with my decision. Chances are you will find someone ya have a better sex life with and also get along with better. They kind of go hand in hand ive learned. Dont settle.
BipolarReddit,fpwy8zg,t1_fpwwkxg,1588972164.0,"Also to add onto this i know guys who cant get it up on stimulants. Both of those combos my heart always goes out to them because back in the day when i did drugs nothing was better then sex on stimulants. Both erectile dysfunction and shrinkage would suck. So idk that also makes me think since some dudes have a prob getting it up and shrinkage accures for some that it might be bloodflow issues. Im not a doctor by any means but if you can get it up and size hasnt changed then idk might be apart of the game (adderall). Since being on lamiktal and seroquel myself i havent experienced any shrinkage but my sex drive is def lower then it was. On speeds tho like i said i have in the past (adderrall, concerta, cocain, meth, mdma, mda, ectasy ect). Either way def talk to your doctor and explain exactly whats going on. If you can get it up just say im a grower not a shower  and go about your business or if it really bothers ya get hard before ya undress for business. Itll work out. Best of luck, much love."

ADHD,fpslfch,t1_fpskk6g,1588875453.0,This same way of thinking has a buddy of mine dying from shooting Meth. Addiction and bi polar go hand in hand. Adderall is extremely addictive. Also who in the world wants more energy on up swings on bi polar thinking its a healthy thing? Unbelievable. To each there own but im not gonna lie to myself thinking add meds are good for bi polar. Im fortunate enough to have a leading psychiatrist help me and im sure he would agree. He would never write add scripts for people who have bi polar. After trusting him and being on correct meds i agree and see why.

If i start thinking i can smoke weed my mind will eventually tell me im ok having a few drinks. Then ill get drunk and think its ok to do a benzo or two. Next thing i know it ill be drunk smoking meth again. Ive been down some bad roads and am very greatful and lucky to be alive and clean.  Im a member of NA and the path its lead me on is incredible. I workout to relieve my tendencies to not be able to sleep. It helps but only does so much. Everyone is different. No judgement here with what others do. Like i said tho my experience for myself is narcotics and bi polar dont mix for me. As far as advice goes concerning positivity and drug use with a solution is easy. NA all day. Helped me tap into spirituality and not live for my own will. Also has helped me realize my fears and accept the fact that i cant control every aspect of my life. Some things are out of my control. Has also given me a purpose (besides my career) of trying to help others. I can truly say this is no doubt a buetiful curse but with meds and honesty and some work ive truly learned how to stay in the buetiful part of it. Im over 6 feet tall and when i went to rehab last two weeks in after detox i weighed 142 lbs. Today im a strong 200lbs. Both physically and mentally i am thriving. Ill never forget the times when all i wanted was to die. Only feelings i could relate to was fear, hate and anger. Couldn't look myself in the mirror. I Was absolutely hopeless and broken. Had warrants and was in with the wrong group of guys. Came a time for me that i was so sick of me i either changed or killed myself. With support of a loving family i made the decision to live and change. Never feel hopeless or that your too far gone. Anything is possible. Much Love."

relationship_advice,fox22t4,t3_g9b38t,1588132237.0,Honestly the lack of communication is the problem here imo. Its weird but not that weird idk.
BipolarReddit,fowd0pz,t3_g9ez8g,1588117410.0,Was like that when i was addicted to heavy substances
BipolarReddit,fow9ego,t3_g9gysv,1588115458.0,Nah my experience is bi polar and drug use dont mix. Happy to say only drugs im doing are lamictal and seroquel. Been using my time to work out and practice positivity.
BipolarReddit,fopr7ck,t3_g8fqil,1587969525.0,Agreed with capitalism to extent. Profits over people is a problem. Making money over peoples misfortune concerning health issues also very unfortunate. With that being said the last thing we need is more illegal things. You claim to care about wellness of human lives but here we stand as land of the free with the most incarcerated lives per capita on the planet. Everyone wants to take something away from there fellow man anymore. Thats also unfortunate. Also hypocritical claims concerning covid and wellness or lack of knowledge. Just my 2 cents. As far as manic theory i completely understand that. Im all over the place and wishy washy in my own life plenty. Either way much love and thank you for sharing.

BipolarReddit,fobngle,t3_g6mkt8,1587661631.0,On 100mgs of lamictal for a month. It seemed to mellow me and slightly improved mood. Hit mania on it snd didnt go full blown. Problem was i had hardcore insomnia when mania happened. Was put on seroquell with lamictal and so far love it. Seemed to balance everything very well. Im also sleeping again.
BipolarReddit,fo4247o,t1_fo0tu57,1587496891.0,I talked to mine and am now on 200 mg of lamictol and newly added 50 mgs of seroquel for insomnia due to mania. Supposibly will help me in diff ways also. Had my first night of real rest last night. Best of luck. Dont fear switching psychiatrists because the right combo of meds is waiting for you. Dont ever feel hopeless.
BipolarReddit,fnze5tt,t3_g4ori6,1587392277.0,Im going threw same thing last two weeks. I have no meds for it. Waiting to hear from my psychiatrist. We are warriors you will def get through this.

relationship_advice,fnzctz9,t3_g4g91v,1587391490.0,I would have to see them to have a comment.
BipolarReddit,fnvbvc2,t1_fl86p2y,1587287445.0,Shit fkn blows man. I think to myself idk if ill make it if its progressive like they say. Im 31 years old and was recently diagnosed. Shits ruined my life. It will get better but i need to find the right meds.
BipolarReddit,fnvbp9g,t1_fl8jm6o,1587287265.0,Me 2. Ive been experiencing that. I was addicted hardcore to benzos and meth and alcohol for years. Im 31 and was just diagnosed. Im going out of my mind. I just dont know how to take it all in. Its weird as anything. Like i know i have it but then ill sit around and look up symptoms and kinda lie to myself like nah thats not me. I was mis diagnosed on paxil for 2 years and it ended up being the demise of an 8 year relationship with someone i truly loved. My swings looking back were off the wall. No1 could handle that. Idk ivw always self medicated which dont get me wrong was horrible also. I was so filled with rage at times on crank and so terribly depressed at other times on benzos and alcohol. I wouldnt wish this shit on my worst enemy. I havent been able to sleep this week. Im on lamictol atm. Put me on tegretol initially but fucked my sex drive up and made me lose my hair. So i quit taking it. I loved the way it made me feel tho. Felt like an adult for the first time in my life. The lamictol semi works but doesnt do nearly as much for me. Anyway im rambling. Much love. Such a buetiful curse 4 real.
relationship_advice,fnutgu8,t3_g3puka,1587270645.0,Sorry man. No not every female is like this but i have encountered a few. If you are a good dude and it sounds like you are ive made a rule for myself that i stick with and has worked for me. Follow your instincts and as soon as someone is compromising your happiness in any way similar to these ways they are simply dropped in a mature and respectful way from me telling them what i just told you. Some will just leave you alone but the majority of these types will keep trying to re enter. Never be a door mat and let them back in. Its hard sometimes but saves alot of pain and negative outlook on females for you. Best of luck.
relationship_advice,fnusini,t1_fnu0aez,1587269934.0,This. 100%. If you cant do that because of your emptions your better off just cutting it and doing the above. Best of luck.
relationship_advice,fnury0p,t3_g3tmlf,1587269518.0,"Also sounds like she needs an outlet. Recommend her competing in mma against someone who actually wants to be competitive or just a bjj league. She needs to learn that duh a man will win against her in almost anything physical, also that other females will put her in line. People like this make mma look bad. If shes so strong and lethal obviously she would be trained to be humble and keep to herself or she will go to jail. Either way a lesson in humility would do her well. Shes just in a weird phase in her life with age and acceptance. Dont worry about it, it will work out. Whatever you do tho dont baby her and let her win. If you care about her thats one of the worst things you could do for her."
