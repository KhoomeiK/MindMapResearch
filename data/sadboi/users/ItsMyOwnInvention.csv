GetMotivated,firit6z,t1_fiqp4rg,1582665200.0,"Hey, I hope you're doing okay. Not going to lie, my childhood and teen years were the worst years of my life. It gets more difficult to remember the good parts as time goes by, especially when they're few and far between. 

Sometimes a song or a smell will bring back a good memory about the smallest thing, could be a frog I found in a creek when I was small, or a pear I ate fresh off a tree, something that brought me joy, and it's pretty special when that happens. I hope the good ones don't vanish for us completely. Wishing you all the best!"

GetMotivated,ez2918n,t1_ez25bgh,1567653648.0,"I see that now. This is from my facebook page, ""It's My Own Invention."" When I drew this in February of 2018  I had been working at my first food service job for a few months. Some days the tiniest quirks in my social interactions with customers made me feel like I had fucked up. I would be tempted to just give up on the job, even though I really needed this job to survive. At the end of the day, I would sort of bargain with myself, telling myself that I was still learning and to go back and do better tomorrow. I was only a month sober from alcoholism then. Now when I look at the drawing, I see there are so many ways it can be interpreted as sinister!"
