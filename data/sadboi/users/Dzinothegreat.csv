EDanonymemes,fmhtud5,t1_fmf11f0,1586093336.0,"happiness is just the realization that we all have what we are desperately searching for, but instead of trying to heal ourselves with love, we enjoy drowning ourselves in sadness and in bad habits, because the sadness we get out of it sometimes is very enjoyable, but our stomach is always telling us that this isn't our true self and we should snap out of it, I've struggled with depression and bad habits for years, and then it just snapped, a few key moments happened and I changed myself, cut out all the toxic people, and everything toxic in general, hell I even blocked all the depressive memes from my life for some time haha, and I learned the value of silence and self worth. There is no magic pill for this, not one soul will make your life better, and you also shouldn't waste your energy to heal others if you are hurting, just know this, and wait for the signs in life, one day you will wake up, and change yourself for the better, we all believe in you, just keep moving forward!"

OCPoetry,fh9pkt5,t3_f18ga1,1581386723.0," I never belonged to a rightful place  
Never have I had my saving grace  
Though a liar is a man that hides his own face  
To escape my reality, I'll be needing some space  
I was always that bridge between my sorrow  
And the happiness of others  
When the chips are all down there will never be another  
Another soul that was meant for me  
That was made for me, that will help me see  
As to truly what I could be  
But now I face eternity...  
Of the souls that will come, and souls that will pass  
And souls that will give hope, and the ones that will last  
And the ones that will forever remain in the past  
Closed into a casket of memories  
Forever cast in the fire that burns them fast  
And lets them down slowly, cause this place is not holly  
The anguish seems to be scolding...  
By all means, everyone can use me!  
Don't how they choose me, but feel free to use me, heavily  
And lean on me temporarily  
Until your love comes around and you live happily... ever after  
I heard that one before, and it is pure banter  
Nothing worse than being the one  
Who waits for the next chapter  
That never arrives...  
Like horses that wait for their departed kings  
Hearts are tangled in the velvet strings  
And my heart is not one of them  
It is full of empty things...  
I have sang my song for centuries no doubt  
But someone else's song was always better to listen  
While the night was panning out  
My melody is crying for love  
But the breath of my piano has had enough  
Of the same sad song, playing all night long  
I see a dove, it is straining it's wings  
Because it's flying against the wind  
Flying to his beloved one  
But she left south before he came back  
A true love story, when all is said and done"
