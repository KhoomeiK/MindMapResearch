BPD,fb2kpgl,t1_fajlxyj,1576452817.0,"I totally agree, especially for people who can’t afford therapy can’t just save up because they pay to live and eat and don’t always have enough and getting up and getting help isn’t easy. Sometimes I feel very unwelcome in the sub just because I don’t have a diagnosis yet. 

I agree that no one should go around saying they have BPD when they haven’t had a diagnosis. But I believe anyone should be allowed to speculate and ask for advice because it’s more than what you know what to at that moment. Anything is sometimes better than nothing. 

It feels like lots of people just kinda took the back seat in this sub till they got diagnosed and now feel like they have a right to bash anyone who hasn’t been diagnosed yet just because they have but we all have to start somewhere and instead of putting others down just kindly explain because they may not know what they are doing is wrong. There shouldn’t be room for hate in here, it should be a place of community, understanding and healing."
BPD,fao95bk,t1_falfhit,1576259670.0,"I understand 100% for what it’s worth in therapy my therapist explained to me how the brain works and it’s our primal instincts or the freeze, fight, or flight part of your brain, if allowed this part of the brain will do nothing and it’s become addicted to your depression, I am absolutely not saying you like being depressed at all (have had a lot of people say that to me unfortunately). But that being said still doesn’t make it easier but it let me understand the thing I’m so scared of. I’m only trying to explain a coping skill, I know it can be upsetting to be told what helps because that’s how I am. So determined to do it alone, but we aren’t alone, and this community shows that. Just keep pushing forward even if it means just waking up in the morning and being alive it’s you progressing. Hang in there❤️"
