The second time I heard the thudding in the attic my boyfriend had already woken me up telling me it sounded like the dog had knocked the fire poker over and it made a big bang against the cast iron wood stove. He just ignored it and then there were 3 loud bangs on the front door. Like police open up! Type bangs. He checked outside and nothing. He was shaking when he woke me up and he is never scared of our ghost. Shortly thereafter he returned to watching TV and I came out to tell him to come hear the thudding in the attic above my room. (It is always above my room) He said right before I came out the bang on the woodstove had happened again.
