SDweed,fqlx148,t1_fqlwxvh,1589467628.0,Unless you are a Sox fan. Then you should ONLY go to Mankind. üòÉüòÉ
SDweed,fqlwxvh,t3_gjhwku,1589467583.0,"Here is what I have found: 

Non medical places like March and Ash, THCSD, Apothekare and the like have a good selection but the prices are higher. You pay for the atmosphere. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I go to March and Ash in Vista to get stuff between my larger purchases. Omar is fucking awesome. 

The medical places play by another set of rules. Who can go into the shop, what they can sell what they can‚Äôt. For instance, some cities won‚Äôt let medical places sell edibles. But their prices are way better. Also, it has been my experience that the employees at medical places know way more about weed. All you need to shop at most of these is a medical ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù. Not a state issued pot card. All places will hook you up with a rec for between $35 and $60 if you need one. They will take the cost of the rec off your tab. They just send you to a doc down the street. 

IMO - Ramona Cannabis Collective and Outco are, hands down, the best place to get legal, larger quantity, good quality weed for way less than anywhere else. Outco has a local grow house and sells ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù at their locations. $85 1/2 oz, out the door. $155 a full oz. the place up in Valley Center (Esco) is a wild location for a shop. This deal was once a week, but since Covid they have it every day. 

Prices - all those fancy bottles and boxes? They are all close to the same price across the board. Every place buys Claiborne or Loudpack or whatever at the same price. They may knock off 5-10% to get you in. You are not going to find that 1/8 of Platinum OG for $10 from any major grower. 

My recommendation- Outco 100%. RCC is really great, but the brand of oz they have doesn‚Äôt treat me right. 

Stay away from Mankind until you feel super comfortable shopping for yourself. 90% of the tenders are jagoffs. It‚Äôs the size of a closet and the vibe feels like a flea market...two customers in the shop and about 10 employees running around. Yet, no one want to help you...yeah go here at your own risk. 

This is a journey I have been taking for awhile. Good luck, have fun and be safe."

BAM"
SDweed,fpwjqts,t1_fpw7py1,1588964667.0,"Yes!! For the record: This was the first legal place I bought. It was awesome. People were super nice and helpful. Not anymore. 

1)I made a joke at checkout about something dumb and the girl called me ‚Äúannoying‚Äù. I notified management. They just gave me discount on my next visit. I didn‚Äôt go back for a year. 
2)I went there a few weeks ago because they were the only disp that had what I wanted. I had some questions about some Pax stuff. The pax stuff is about three feet away from the counter. The guy didn‚Äôt even come out, he just pointed. I said I had questions. He reluctantly cam out from behind the counter and told me that could find my answers on the internet and then went back behind the counter. 
3)The employee/customer ratio would indicate that people are there to help you. That is not the case. They bullshit and bitch about the place until you interrupt them and then give shitty answers. 

Me - ‚ÄúWhat should I look at when I inspect a bud?‚Äù
Tender - ‚Äúsee if you like it...‚Äù
Me - What am I looking for?
Tender - ‚Äú...if you like it...‚Äù

This is a true story. Training in the field of cannabis is 100% nonexistent. In contrast, I was in a place last Friday where the tender and I talked for about 10 minutes about THC-a and the benefits over fresh vs. high thc. THIS is what I expect from a brick and mortar. Those answers are the kind of thing I would get from a delivery driver. 

4) Space. It‚Äôs been years since it was legalized. The shop is SO tiny. Yet there is this constant flow of keycard carriers going back and forth between offices. March and Ash...check them out. Sure it‚Äôs a different business model, but come on Mankind at least try to get close. 

5) Price. I was spending SO much money there. I had no idea that places like Outco/San Diego Naturals, Ramona Cannibis Collective and other places have ounces for under $175. That is not a typo. Is it great weed? It‚Äôs fine. At this point I‚Äôm going for quantity over quality. I usually buy a ‚ÄúCadillac eighth‚Äù along with my oz. for winding down. Mankind has no bulk pricing and the prices on product in general are too high."

The problem is that foreign investors are bidding out average buyers and driving up prices.
Sure, they invest in high price real-estate. But that pushes us average buyers to outlying or rural areas. This is why Idaho, Washington, Texas and Colorado are super expensive.
