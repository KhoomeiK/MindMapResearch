The storm comes when other people appear in the picture. But I am certain that with his love and support, we will be able to manage even that eventually.

A few days ago we had a fight. A really bad fight that ended up physical. I said so many horrible disgusting things to her, shouting on the top of my voice and snarling into her face. So she slapped me. And I slapped back, you get the picture.

Same old drill. So disgusted with myself I just feel like vomiting all the time. I don't know how to handle her or myself, or most of the other people. Hoping, nah, fantasising about getting cancer and fucking die ASAP without having the guilt of suicide.
