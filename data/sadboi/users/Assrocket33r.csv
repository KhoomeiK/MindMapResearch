When she said that men might be able to breastfeed, it was a joke, but at first it seemed like she believed it.

When she said people in the medieval era possibly found other ways to feed their babies it sounded like she genuinely thought they used formula, but I'm pretty sure she was actually thinking of other ways (eg: using a rag dipped in goats milk or something). People are pretty resourceful. She missed the entire POINT of the question when she said this and made it seem like she doesn't think breastfeeding is a biological necessity.

The problem is, I was so scared I wasn't 100% sure that I was SUPPOSED to touch the lever (I was so nervous while being strapped in that I didn't fully absorb this information from the woman who strapped me in) and this fear only intensified after a few minutes of being suspended 50 metres in the air, with only a few seatbelts keeping me in place.

study,fr4ldty,t3_gmhdgp,1589891405.0,"What kind of words do you need to remember? (I hope that's not a dumb question - I know nothing about the GRE).

I'm a nerd for language and I've found that you can usually accurately guess what an unfamiliar word means by separating it into the 'root' words (eg: photo+graph+ic) or comparing it to other known words (Vulpix the pokemon is similar to 'vulpine', meaning 'foxlike'). Understanding the meaning of prefixes and suffixes is important, as well as understanding the origins of a word. The context of a sentence is also helpful when in doubt.

[Common prefixes, suffixes and root words](https://studylib.net/doc/8433191/common-prefixes--suffixes--and-roots)

If you focus on learning these aspects of words, it might reduce the number of flash cards you have to use, but it might give you better tools to actively learn on your own.

In addition I HIGHLY recommend you start reading. Every time you come across a word you aren't 100% confident with, google the meaning and reread the last few sentences of your book with that new information in mind to 'set' that new information in your head. (That's how I learn new words. It helps to re-visualise the scene in order to fully absorb the meaning of the new word)."

Unfortunately, my doctor is a fucking donkey and never diagnosed me with anything substantial so I can't even tell you why I feel this way. It's been a sourse of incredible self-doubt for me. I literally attempted suicide last year and I still think ""am I just doing this for attention?""

From what I understand, my body isn't producing enough serotonin. I visited the doctor during a rough point in my life (workplace stress and relationship issues) so I was already feeling pretty down and he said my serotonin problems may be related to my recent issues. However, I've had issues with anxiety (and therefore feelings of depression) my entire life so who knows? :^)

 I honestly don't know if my body is defective or if I am just sensitive to negative events in my life. I asked recently for a proper diagnosis and his reply was this annoyingly flowery message along the lines of ""you feel how you feel and that's totally valid so don't worry about a diagnosis"" BUT BRO I'M WORRYING.

And that's my story.

Take my love of escitalopram with a grain of salt. It worked for me. It may not work for you. It's normal to struggle to find the right meds for you. You may not even respond to medication at all. Therapy may be better. Or a mixture. Or simply quitting your job and cutting off toxic people and abusers from your life.

My doctor had a good point: A diagnosis isn't always important. Your feelings are valid and if they cause you stress, kick their ass and do what you need to do to get better. I'm still salty about my lack of diagnosis because it's a pain in the ass but whatever.

If you're struggling, see a doctor. Be honest. Write a list of the most worrying points. Pro tip: if it's hard to talk about, you NEED to bring it up.

Your friend may feel the same way towards you.

Even if you go back to your 'normal' friendship one day, he may always feel a little wary of you like you're just waiting to pounce on him.

I think honestly your best move is to send him a message with a sincere apology, an explanation (if you have one), a plan to stop that shit ever happening again in the future (eg: limiting alcohol when you do drink), and a promise to leave him alone for good unless he contacts you first.

That message should contain everything you need to say to him. After that point, let HIM decide if the friendship is worth salvaging."

truechildfree,fqhc06f,t3_giu6i1,1589373636.0,"IMO there's two types of people who say 'children are the meaning of my life'.

First, there's the crazy ones, who view kids as objects. They don't actually want to be parents, they just want the title and the respect that comes with it. They want a cute little thing they can control and show off like a trophy. They're the type to get sick of the kid once the kid starts developing a personality and stops being cute, because it means they will need to be treated like a person from now on. Children aren't the 'meaning' of their life. Children are the 'stepping stone' of their life towards making themselves seem more important and valuable and special because they're 'parents'. :\^)

Then there's the second type, and I'm sorry for the novel but I'm about to brag hard about my sister because I love her. She's the second type. :)

My sister is the type who wanted children pretty much her entire life. She used to come home after school and she would teach 10-year-old me what she was learning. As I grew older she would give me 'life lessons' about stuff - how to catch a bus, how to love my own appearance (super grateful for that one - she nipped my body image issues in the bud), and she encouraged me to be hardworking and tidy (two things I was SHIT at, but am now pretty good at).

Her goal is to love and care for someone and to be a good role model for a growing person. She's exactly the type of person who SHOULD be a parent. She now has two daughters of her own, and she is also studying to be an early childhood teacher so she can continue to dedicate her life to children. I think it's really nice that she got to achieve both goals. :)

I guess what I'm getting at is the difference between people who dedicate themselves to serving others, and people who dedicate themselves to serving... themselves. I hope that makes sense?"

I have never heard of that before. However, multiple people in this comment section have mentioned it (and many of those who don't explicitly mention it seem to have understood the reference anyway) so I learned something new. :)

As for your original comment, I think it's entirely possible that you're correct and this is just an unfortunate coincidence (which is one of the reasons why OP blurred the license plate - they've made a comment about it).

That said, IMO it's perfectly likely that the guy is just an asshole. Like you said in your comment, NASCAR fans have a disproportionately large number of fuckups among them, plus multiple people in this comment section seem to understand the reference, which makes me think there's a good chance he does too.

You said the people he could be referring to are all good people, and they have done a lot to improve the way NASCAR is seen by the world (by leading as a god example). It's crap that they've wound up represented in this bad light by a fan (either intentionally or accidentally) because it makes THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY look like shit. ):

It's nice to hear good stuff about NASCAR from someone who is passionate about it. I live in New Zealand and I've always been the indoorsy type so I never had an interest in NASCAR. Pretty much the extent of my knowledge is ""monster energy drinks, racism, Southern USA, and fast cars"" and half of that is probably wrong lmao. But today I learned a bit about some good names in the business. As a result I learned TWO things today, thanks. :)"
