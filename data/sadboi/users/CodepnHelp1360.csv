BPDlovedones,flzmjyi,t1_flzm9na,1585627409.0,"Thats understandable but i wouldn't spend more energy trying to figure her out. From what you say, it sounds like she had her own stuff going on too, so there may not be any rhyme or reason to it. Spend the energy trying to figure yourself out instead. Think of where you will be 1 year from now if you take all the energy and time you spend on her and spend it on you instead!

And as for how she can be happy with someone else? Well, a drug addict with a sober person = prob lots of fighting. Two people who both do the same drug? They're prob not fighting, at least not about the drug use. A neat freak + slob= fights! Two slobs? Prob don't  care about the mess so no fights. A frugal person plus a spender will fight. But what if both people love to spend and are not bothered by living paycheck to paycheck? No fights. You see what I'm saying? If she's happy, all that means is she found someone who is ""ok"" with her way of living. It is okay that you were not that person! In fact, you shouldn't try to change your own boundaries to fit around someone else's. You can't just change the fact your a neat freak, for example, and learn to live with the mess! You'll be miserable! So be glad she found someone and focus instead on finding yourself and what you want."

You're sitting here obsessing over her and wishing her misery? Not healthy. Not trying to be mean, just giving you honest feedback. Have you considered therapy?

Stop trying to diagnose your ex and just focus on you. If she is happy, then good for her. Wish her well. Like i said, its not a zero sum game. You can be happy too, but not if you're bitter and mad she's doing well. That's not your best self."

BPDlovedones,flzk5vo,t3_frymqf,1585625649.0,"You sound very invalidating. Why are her perspective and feelings ""crap""? And you rarely apolgize? Relationships are 50-50, it's never entirely one person's fault. If you won't admit to more than insignificant wrong doings and blame it all on her then, yes, you are likely dysfunctional yourself. 

I wouldn't go diagnosing her. BPD is a complex mental health disorder that can only be diagnosed by a professional. It has symptoms that overlap with a variety of other mental health disorders too.

My advice is to look up some dbt. There are some good resources online. And when you fight, you should each try to write down the other person's perspective.

If you strongly think she is mentally ill...then i would suggest encouraging her to get help and seeking couples couseling. Also, breaking up might be the best option if the relationship is harmful to your mental health.

If you feel that you are significantly higher functioning than her, then you may be the codependent one, trying to ""save her"" or ""dating down"" to avoid fear of abandonment.

Some therapists think bpd IS cptsd to an extreme. Or that codependency is BPD or another PD. Some say INFJ personality type is indicative of BPD. ADHD and BPD are often misdiagnosed bc their symptoms overlap that much. Just to make a point about how blurry the line can be....

Diagnosis is subjective. Someone can go to 5 different therapists and get 5 different diagnoses. It's the biggest flaw with psychology as a science, that they can't yet make it so that diagnosis is consistent across therapists for the same patient."

All OP can control is his half. If OP is unable to leave, validation of emotions WILL de-escalate a person with BPD while emotional invalidation will escalate.

Ex: ""I understand that you are angry and why you are angry. However, i am unable to process what you are saying when you are yelling at me. I want to be able to hear you so let's table this discussion at a time when we are both feelong more centered."" If they continue ""again, i understand you are angry but i will not tolerate being yelled at. If you continue to yell, i will leave the room/hang up the phone/whatever.

If you want to work on the communication, it sounds like a little validation would go a long ways with her. Stay calm, and validate the feeling. Just because you acknowledge how she feels doesn't mean you're saying she's 100% right and you're 100% wrong.

Next time she says ""sorry for being moody"" maybe say something like ""we all have days like that. I hope you feel better soon.""

And she has a point, treating an arguement like a debate is not productive if your goal is to repair the relationship. Partners are supposed to be on the same team, not in battle mode.

That said, people have lives that can get in the way of messaging/responding. If he responds 90% of the time, and sometimes can't due to hanging out with friends or sleeping, then I would say your anger is masking your insecurity. It sounds like you take his lack of response as a sign that he is not fully committed or interested, and ignoring the fact that he may have other things going on. So yes, that would be codependent.
