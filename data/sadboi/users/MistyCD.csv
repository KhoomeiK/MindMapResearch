I have had some encounters of more than an hour at PIV and I would have liked it to be longer. I love long sex sessions, but I rarely have a partner. If I had the chance I think I'd have sessions of more than an hour daily. With last girl the shortest piv were about 40 minutes, was what she liked best and I loved it. When she was tired or satisfied she would tell me to finish and cum. You could say I've had all the sex I've been allowed."

At this moment I just got up and I want to go to bed again, but I could make a list of things I'd like to do if it were all right :/ Actually when you're okay you can enjoy anything and you don't need this shit. It's funny that we have to make lists, set objectives, goals and all of that when that would have to be something natural and normal. We're often so lost that we don't know what to do, we shouldn't need some kind of reminder or a psychologist to ask us what we want to do with our lives. The life of a normal and/or happy person simply flows.

Some single day when I was drunk or for some strange reason I felt really good and energetic, everything was easy and pleasant, you can't imagine how much, even you understand why people live and don't want to shoot themselves. Then you go back to your depressive state and wonder why you're like this when everything should be different, and if to have two good days a year it's worth going on. Rational response after taking a balance is the obvious one, but there is some life (and hope) left in our dead lives.

If you were fine you'd just do things or you wouldn't mind not doing them. They don't have to be big things, look at the average life, many are happy with very simple things, and it's not because they're basic or silly, actually if the chemistry of our brain worked well many of us would be alike."

Luckily sometimes after a nap I feel better than the long sleep itself. I mean, I get up, stay awake1/2/3 hours, it depends, I take a short nap, and I might be a little better. There are days when nothing works and I'm tired all day.  I rarely feel energized, just can feel something less tired. Showering (better with cold water), going out if the weather is good, coffee and intense sport can help a little. But I'm so tired and with so much desire for bed that many days I do not do any of this. One of the thoughts that happens to me is ""if I want to rest the coffee is not a good idea, nor dress to lie down"". In the end I don't do anything and end up worse than I could really be.

Before I was a little more disciplined and even with that thought, sometimes I'd take a nap but then I'd do what I said.

When I met another girl who in our second meeting said ""we have a lot of clothes"" when we arrived at her house, it was strange and fascinating in equal parts. When someone wants you and  did her part to please you, you don't just enjoy sex more, you feel more loved. The opposite besides being more unpleasant, conveys a certain sense of selfishness and hatred that a partner be selfish.

Ironically this girl was a virgin before she met me and she looked like asperger (I'm part of it too), in fact, had a misdiagnosis of autism. Sometimes appearances and  lack of experience are misleading, there are talented people with good attitude from minute 1. With inexperienced people you have to be indulgent, the problem is when someone is like that when he has had several long-lasting couples. Maybe you can fix it by talking to that person, but should have learned that sex is a 2-person thing."

In childhood he had strange behaviors, which can be interpreted as symptoms of depression in addition to a very deep shyness. I went from being one of the best students to suspending all subjects at 15. I had an important attitude of passivity and isolation. When I was 17, I had a severe depressive episode with a lot of anxiety. Until then I had not known sadness, was rather dysthymia or apatia. That's when my real problems started, but I think since I was born something is wrong with my head.

In general I have almost always lived in a dysthymic state with muted emotions rather than deep suffering. In fact, my diagnosis is chronic dysthymia with non-specific personality disorder. I don't rule out that there's anything else. I have studied 2-3 years since then and some specific course, I have not worked, I have not had social relations in excess, nor in general I have done much more than being in front of a computer wasting time. I comment on all this because these are things that are supposed to aggravate these problems, lack of mental and physical exercise does not help.

Reading some of here I see my case is less serious than I thought, anyway, my memory sucks and it's gotten a lot worse. I'm taking it very badly and I can't accept it.

I was surprised, because before that I had only had a ""long"" relationship, about a year, which is where I had all the sex of my life. The difference with that girl is very noticeable, I knew that vaginas were different both in shape and size, but I didn't imagine it was so noticeable.

The first time I laid with the last one, I was nervous and it didn't get hard. And it was impossible to stick my penis in him until I finally got a good erection. With the other one it wasn't like that, I could be completely flaccid and put it in to turn me on. It was so tight that if it wasn't well lubricated, or even depending on the position, it could even hurt. The tight girl was taking the pill, it was tall and wide (not fat), so not everything is proportioned xd

I couldn't tell you what was more pleasant, they were different sensations in different moments of my life. Right now it's more difficult for me to come and I have a more insensitive penis than when I was in the ""long"" relationship.

So I think that our thickness goes quite well depending on the person, I suppose that there will be who values more 5.5"", but for others we go very well. Also girls who really like to have long PIV sessions have trouble holding on with a thick penis, plus it's uncomfortable for oral and anal sex. With the last one we could have one hour fucking sessions and us loved it, but many girls with 15 minutes of PIV are satisfied and start to get bored, so well...

In my case the passage of time has led me to bad times and not so bad, I guess the progression of each will be different. Maybe some medication or therapy can help you, even a diet and good habits. Not everyone has to end up like me. I may not have had the right people next to me either, and my attitude may have been questionable in many ways.

Good luck, is better had only depression and a ""good life"" instead of depression and a shitty life.

Actually having depression and a good life aren't synonymous at all, but you know what I mean. I also tell you not to neglect yourself at all, you may not look like a problem as serious as others, but it may last longer and you may end up worse than other people with mental illnesses who appeared to be worse.

Take it seriously and get professional assistance (if you don't already) as soon as possible.

The problem is that I can't have a psychiatrist and psychologist assigned simultaneously to the place I'm in.

Well, in a way yes, I would force myself with the support of others, but as I said that option is something that is requested and that one does not know when it will be available, or if it will be useful or lasting.

I'd like to answer everything, but I don't speak English and DeepL translator helps but it's not perfect.

What hurts me is that not even in my best times am I really happy, it's like going from a mediocre state to a bad one, and from a bad one to a bad one, and from a bad one to a mediocre one. The balance of my life is a disaster, I can not stop thinking about suicide in general because the best I aspire or what I am, is not good and sooner or later I will be worse.

More than a fighter, I've had a comfortable life. I may have been unhappy, but I haven't had to work, study, or do too much at home either. Most of the time I've had different and apathy rather than deep suffering.

The few days that I have been really well, that have been very few, if I could find meaning to live if that lasted. Everything feels so different... But it is a passing illusion that then leads me to a relapse or to have several horrible ones and they drive me crazy.

Psychopharmaceuticals can temporarily screw up your sex life, incidence of sexual problems with SSRI are so high, which are just the most typical pharmaceuticals for this disease. Well, taking antidepressants or having a disease isn't exactly lying. Depression doesn't kill my libido, but with medication I did have problems. I was single, so I couldn't tell you if I would reject sex as such, masturbation is not as appetizing plus the side effects of the pill, I didn't feel like it in addition to having problems to cum, erection problems... Total for nothing, I stopped taking them for being ineffective and just giving me discomfort.

You will have to talk to the doctor and evaluate a change of medication, in the same pharmacological group there may be some medication that does not affect you as much in your sexual life. Medicines can help, but sometimes they just give you trouble.

Anyway, because of my way of being I think that even if I didn't want to fuck as such, at least I would use my hands and my mouth to satisfy my partner, but then at the same time I am inconsiderate with my family in other aspects, so in the end, judging is very easy and each of us is affected by things in a different way."

With the last girl I was with, was delighted that the PIV lasted more than an hour and that we could do it a couple of times when there was time. I can actually cum earlier if I want to, but I have a feeling of dissatisfaction if I don't throw myself at least 40 minutes. With the couple of girls I've been with they'd tell me when they were tired or in pain, then we'd just finish. I would love to try constant 2-3 hour sessions, but I didn't have and don't get the chance, with masturbation I sometimes do but this doesn't motivate me as much.

Honestly, I prefer have sex than anything else in my spare time especially when I like/love someone, it's my first priority, and 2-3 long sessions a day are great. I have a refractory period sometimes high, so I prefer not to cum to be able to continue and that we can prolong pleasure. I'd actually prefer to cum once a day and have a lot of sex, enjoy orgasms but I prefer to go on and on, I don't know what my limit will be, I've never got tired/bored so to speak. I think we're just a few people who feel this way, so we're having a hard time. If it were not enough I am a very shy and depressive person, my social skills are terrible.

So i take it for granted that if i'm still alive, i'll hardly find anyone who loves and satisfies me. Just getting a relationship for me is really hard, I was 5 years single recently, I breaked streak to be well for a couple of months literally and single again. This is really sad, then you see people who are with women who don't care about them, and here I am, alone with a terrible desire.

I also don't know what it is to lower the frequency, my only ""long"" relationship lasted a year, and the girl only liked a daily session and to be penetrated around 20 minutes, some days we repeat once but already.

sex,f354wfz,t3_dfig2g,1570668496.0,"2-4 in a week is not high sex drive even close IMO. With my exs was almost daily 1 or 2 times, for me the ideal would be 15-25 sessions. 26m, with chronic depression, I feel a lot of fatigue and have much lower libido due to the sequelae of the medications. Before this I had no limit and no refractory period, I could cum 10 times in one day, I am surprised to read that people fuck so little when i am not even a shadow of what i was.

Sex is too much fun to do so little; you get up and feel like it, before going to sleep, too. If you want repeat, or dunno, want to have fun in the afternoon, is not hard reach 3-4 times on one day. There will be busy people, but most people prefer to invest their time in things that for me are superfluous, when sex with someone you like and love is the best thing in the world. I can't understand it."
depression,f2tgna6,t1_f2tg689,1570394819.0,"The best thing is when you have no free time and you want to have it and then do literally nothing. Yayyy! ""I'm never going to throw time away again."" SURE. It's a good thing there are precooked ones."
depression,f2tf1ss,t3_de42b8,1570394135.0,"Depends on what, especially if it's physical. Normally physical activity helps me, sedentary activities although I love them, can make me feel worse. And I want to study, read, play video games, watch movies, etc.. Sometimes I get on and after 1 hour, if it arrives, I'm exhausted, lacking concentration, listless and I have to stop.

The problem is that I often start with sedentary hobbie, get stuck and tired, and then I don't do anything to feel good. But it's hard, you know? I'd like to get up and be able to read something interesting or continue that game that I left halfway, not having to do things all the time to clear myself and combat fatigue... 

I like being a homebody, and see that before I could be like this without feeling so bad, also see that many people can be 10 hours in front of a computer and being happy, not like me, is a pain.

I don't understand how people with reduced mobility can cope with it, maybe it doesn't affect them as much as I do the lack of movement or dunno. It's no longer the trauma of not being able to do things, it's the fact that my body without physical activity is malfunctioning.

Sometimes even the physical doesn't help much and I'm feel bad, no matter what I do, but I have to admit that the less I do, the less I want to do.  It must be said that when you have already entered the loop of not moving it is difficult to break the cycle and regain good habits."
depression,f2tb0e8,t3_de2xzt,1570392728.0,"Yeah, some days are terrible. I've barely been able to get out of bed these last few days, my head directly doesn't work, I have thoughts like limited and distant, only have desire to die and if I wanted to, I wouldn't have the strength to do it. But when I notice the tiredness hit me so hard, is when I think more that I do not want and I can not fight any more. Sometimes I wonder if I have been well diagnosed or if something else happens to me, like chronic fatigue or some other internal problem that is not ""psychological"", purely physical. I know that tiredness is a symptom of depression, but so much? Even when I don't think about anything and try to be positive? I have chronic dysthymia diagnosis and many times I do not feel sadness at all, in reality I often have the emotions as dead and only notice the tiredness and an obsessive and defeatist personality.

I've been given modafinil recently which is a stimulant medication used in patients with narcoplepsy and mehhhh, even with keto diet and coffee still exhausted... Today I've finally taken carbohydrates and I think I'm going to leave the diet, I'm very skinny and maybe I have some deficit in addition to depression. I'm also losing muscle mass, I do not rule out resuming the diet but right now I do not stop losing weight and I do not notice the improvement that some say they have energy with this diet.

I'm going to start a two month course this wednesday and i'm so tired and depressed that i don't know what the hell i'm going to do to face it. As I write this I have a constant desire to get into bed and not get out in too long. Yay!"
depression,f2prfza,t3_ddsm56,1570349113.0,"I think braces are one of those things that worries a lot more the one who carry it than to others. There are even those who like it, it gives a touch of innocence or youthfulness that can even be attractive in the eyes of certain people.

In your case is understandable your concern for what you have gone through and your traumas, but believe me it is not so bad you'll see. At 17, classmates are usually more mature and the chances of bullying are significantly reduced.

Like you said, it's something small, don't make it so big in your head. Cheer up!"
depression,f2nhipb,t1_f2n5bj0,1570316083.0,"That's a bad idea. Death (if it comes) is slow and you suffer, you can be fucked for a week to be saved.  You can also end up with serious and irreversible liver damage.

I have met a bunch of people who survived, one of them is 16 years old girl who's waiting for a transplant. 

Don't do it. Live or look for a more efficient method. Value very much that if it goes wrong don't end up with damages that will make your life even more miserable."
depression,f2nemzl,t3_ddlzpk,1570315100.0,"My lack of energy and cognitive decline are the worst. In part, this has led me to do nothing, which is what you say. With my fatigue and my lack of attention and memory I can't enjoy a third of what I think I should. I feel so dumb when I used to have good academic skills, although the WAIS I made as an adult didn't give much more than 90... It would cost me a lot to return to studies because of fatigue, but if it were not enough, my head would never work the same as before. When as a child I seemed to excel, much less than a gifted person but there were things I was quite good at.

I would like to get lost in novels, poetry and learn many things, enjoy and find out about a good movie or video games, finally learn English, an instrument, draw... I am a very curious person and with many interests, but I just waste time and feel bad.

I think something has always worked wrong with me, but since I was 13 I started to lose the desire to live without a strong trigger, at 17 I had my worst depressive episode and since then I've never been the same, not only did my thinking change, it was like something much more physiological.. I'm close to 30 and I can't take it anymore. Medications have never done too much and I've tried so many, including a couple of stimulants and nootropics.

When I've had a good day, which hardly ever happens, I realize how wonderful life could be if I wasn't sick. Everything is much easier, more natural, more pleasant... It's incredible how almost arbitrarily doing the same thing can be so different. And it hurts a lot, because it shouldn't be like that.

There are days I try not to think and just do things. It doesn't work either. The only thing that makes me more productive sometimes and less unhappy is physical activity of a certain intensity, but it doesn't always work the same way and it's very hard for me to put on a sweatshirt and get out.  Sometimes getting drunk, which I don't think is highly recommended. And love... but it's a double-edged sword that the few times it came up, I end up cutting myself. 

There are periods that I get a little better doing a lot of my part, but then I go back. In those periods I still suffer from dysthymia, but I am something more productive and positive. The problem is... Neither much less is enough. Not even in my best moments am I really well, everything still very forced, not natural, being aware that on top of that I'll be worse off after a while. If that's the best I aspire to be, the balance of my life is terrible."
depression,f2n3w3d,t3_ddpyx1,1570311737.0,"I wish there was an antidepressant that had such an effect. I rarely drink, but it often makes me enjoy real hobbies. My thoughts and my feelings change so much... I even write poetic things that don't come out serenely. This sucks.

Although I don't do it, sometimes I consider the possibility of getting high with all kinds of substances, total I think I will die soon and it's a waste not to mistreat my body. I guess deep down I'm hopeful and I don't want to scare my family going in bad conditions to home."
patientgamers,f0lvgra,t3_d54iko,1568730537.0,"The game I've most played against bots was possibly jedi knight 2&3, then Timesplitters Future Perfect and Perfect Dark, but these haven't aged at all well, anyways PD has an emulator where you can use mouse and I guess it won't feel so bad.  At the present time occasionally I keep playing some arena fps like Quake 3/Live or Nexuiz (2012 version and 2005, like both), in this sub-genre there is plenty to choose from. I have to prove Xonotic, which is a fork of the original Nexuiz and Quake Champions. I'm sure it's worth it and they both have bots.

If you put the graphics aside, give a chance to JK3, testing powers of force, lightsaber duels and so on is interesting.. BTW Counter-Strike: Condition Zero have medals and missions against bots, even apart, a campaign that is more similar to a cod or action game (CS:CZ DS) is unique in this respect with respect to other CS.

Nexuiz 2012, Unreal Tournament 3/4 and TOXIKK  if this is a priority. Yes... Almost all I have quoted are arena fps. Overwatch and TF2 has bots, but I don't know if they're competitive."
sex,eypewa8,t3_cxzmki,1567298112.0,"Yeah, but some guys need more stimulation than others. It also depends on the day, age, how long you don't cum and other factors Anyway you can get an erection with stimulation without the need for attraction, although the attraction helps and usually kisses the one who attracts you."
