Mine, for instance, help me much more with motivation rather than emotions, and while that's not what I need, it is on a track that can lead me to fixing my emotional issues by myself. So while you think they aren't effective, it is still worth taking them to try and see what they do for you and based off of that and your needs, find the right med for you."
