Showerthoughts,ffmm8mj,t3_etrar7,1580056592.0,"Yeah, when I was a kid my parents basically put me on a pedestal that they themselves could not reach. Neither of them finished school, my mother basically quit her job as a stay at home mother when I was in 3rd or 4th grade, I was told if I did any type of drug they'd kill me and then I find out my dad was a dealer for the longest time and my mom was doing drugs while I was a baby. I found out most of this after posing the question of how I get through life without loosing it."

depression,fbt1wov,t3_ee58qm,1577066120.0,"Love, atleast to me, isn't something we give but something that kind of just flows from us. I've been trying to get away from my family for years now, and I'm currently at their house and have spent more than I'd like to admit on them for the holidays. It's hard. I may not be able to give you the best advice but just follow you're heart, it will tell you what to do."

Someone you love and trust, arguably the number one person you should be able to count on, and they betray you. I'm just starting to understand that there's nothing special about parents, that they're just people like everyone else. The worst part is you know how they're but can't help yourself from loving them, they could crush you in an instant and you could forgive them just as fast. Why? I'm still trying to figure it out myself."
