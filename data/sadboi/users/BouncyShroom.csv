Around 6 months ago pre-LTR, I was lifting and taking care of my health. I am was in the process of losing weight, and things were going good and I was feeling amazing mentally.

Somehow ended up in a LTR with a girl, who didn't really match my goals. She was large, and smoked a load of weed. I'd kicked those habits ages ago because they only had a detrimental impact to me.

In those 4 months we'd been together, I had stopped exercise. My diet went south because we'd just go out and eat shit. She was fat, so didn't really care for her health. My weekends, which usually consisted of going for long walks/hikes in the morning and working on my hobbies, ended up with me visiting her and doing nothing productive.

This girl was really insecure too, so every time I was out with my friends or at a house party, she'd get annoyed because I think she'd I would cheat on her. She expected me to face-time her after work for a good hour or two at least. I'd never face-timed a girl in my life for more than a few mins, so you could imagine how draining this was both mentally and time wise.

I started to realize near the end that I too was slowly drowning. I'd literally lost my purpose, and being with this girl accomplished nothing for me. The little time I had, I was wasting it. I started spending less time with her, then broke up, I realized that:

A) Work on yourself first, then a LTR. Don't lose yourself if you enter one

What hurts me the most is that I've been told I am attractive by girls, and I've also somehow managed to bed a few girls who were hot during my drunken states in college. I've even had a Gf during my 1st year of college wen I was obese. I've had girls come into my life who basically wanted me to make the move, but I was to afraid because of my insecurity.

I fully agree with you, the most recent girl (the one I was referring to) I met when I was 20lbs heavier than I currently am. Heck, it was the same with even all the other girls. She was attracted to a fatter version of me.

I used to be very obese until 2 years ago, and until then I really didn't get much female attention apart from ""being friends"". When I got to an acceptable weight (still overweight, but looked alright) I started to get female attention but it was the sexual/romantic type instead.

That shit was alien to me, and to some extent is still alien to me. How can a woman find me ""attractive""? Surely she's just being friendly. I cannot describe how many situations I experienced like this, where a woman wanted me more than friends, but back then I was soo naive to it all and only until a couple of months ago I can go back to the 4 years of college and life and say ""wow, she wanted to fuck me"". Like I say, I could write a small book.

I had a really hot girl kiss me at a party, then for 5 months straight go out religiously every weekend to go out with her 1 on 1 to places, drinking, parties, ,meeting her other friends, meeting her fucking parents. It was almost like a relationship, but we didn't fuck. She used to kiss me when we met up, and just whenever. I used to think ""She's just being friendly"". She said to me ""I find you attractive"" and other shit like this. She even indirectly asked towards the end of the 5 months if I'm ""fully single"". She wanted to fucking know why the fuck I wasn't asking her out, but at the time I was too stuck up in my head.

I guess it really ""woke me up"" after this happened, and realized how badly my insecurities are affecting me in life. I know it sounds pathetic.

&#x200B;

I guess it's something I need to work on though, I'm just about to enter my mid 20's and to be completely honest I can't really carry on like this. I can't imagine being 26 or 27 still suffering from this shit in my life. It is the root cause of my anxiety and depression of ""not being enough"". It feels like I don't deserve to be with a woman in my life, even if they enter mine and we both are attracted to each other.

The nail in the coffin for me was 6 months ago, where I really liked this girl and she REALLY liked me back too. She was waiting 5 months for my ass to make a proper move and to be with her, and this is after we used to kiss all the time too. My insecurity was soo bad about me taking my shirt off in bed I basically friend zoned myself.
