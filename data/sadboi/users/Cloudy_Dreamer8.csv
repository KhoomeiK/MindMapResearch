Chonkers,ffzzbjs,t1_ffzlvmp,1580396674.0,"He allows you to exist in his presence.  And if he feels so inclined, he will slap you.  His previous owner had him declawed. But he still packs a punch."

BipolarReddit,eyz59b4,t3_czisy3,1567609874.0,I’m still recovering from yelling at my father in law and sister in law in front of my husbands coworkers and other friends.  The embarrassment that washes over my every time I think about it makes me cringe and anxious all over again.  I never knew it was part of my bipolar.  I’m new to this.  Thank you for sharing.

facebookwins,eri1qcy,t1_erhzw5x,1560887626.0,"I’m from Arkansas.  I see the flag everywhere. But in no way will I argue for some racist, homophobic, redneck’s right to fly it.  If you’re that proud of it just put a sign out that says “My ancestors owned slaves and we are proud of that!” .. serves the same purpose."
