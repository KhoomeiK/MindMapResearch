 We'd talk to people and find out who was likely spending way more than they could afford to to give their kids some good memories. We'd comp them in and give them our 50% meal tickets and extra discount off merch tickets we got around the holidays.

Hands down made working there and all the low pay worth it. I hope those people remember us and not some giant corporation."
