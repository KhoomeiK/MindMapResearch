personalfinance,esj55u2,t1_eshujy9,1562026222.0,"You're welcome! It's not hard to find one with openings. There's major shortages Nationwide, especially in rural areas. And they're always always always in need of nurses. Not just for circulating and sedation, but also the prep/post holding area. It's also a great place to spring board your career towards becoming a nurse anesthetist.

Either way, good luck!!"
personalfinance,eshtsbg,t3_c7mws2,1562000860.0,"Not really financial help related.. but with your background in ICU, you could look into working in the Cardiac Cath Lab. Most labs hire RNs with Critical Care experience, or ED backgrounds.

The pay is much better, but the bonus is call pay. And after a couple of years you'll be prepared for a Traveling Cath Lab RN gig that can pay exponentially better than an ICU travel RN."
BPDmemes,esbyol1,t1_esac7qj,1561815975.0,"Have BPD, am a mom of 3 girls. I'd love that person to ask all 3 of them how shitty of a parent I am. I was raised by an alcoholic mother, and I've done everything in my power to be a better parent than what I was gifted with.

My oldest says I'm her best friend. I talk openly with my girls and explain my illness. We also talk about any and everything. I include them. I put their needs first. Just because I have a mental illness doesn't mean I can't function as a decent human being."

It is sooo gaslighting. My husband does this.. he'll ask ""Are you having an episode?"" and it just makes it worse!! Fuck you. I'll have my feelings whether or not you think they're justified. Just... Fuck off."

BPD,es48aiw,t3_c5o5pf,1561579215.0,"I've always loved school, because I'm smart and good at it. So going to school was always easy. I'd get praised and I'd see immediate results for actions.

I became an x-ray tech way before I knew I had BPD. I've held a job for over 5 years. I like my career, but have bounced around. I've found I'm excellent with patients, and radiology gives me the ability to not focus on one task too long. I get my patients, perform the x-ray, and it's all done in less than 10 minutes.

The worst part is co workers. Thankfully there are so many opportunities that I've managed to switch jobs when I'm getting over one place."
