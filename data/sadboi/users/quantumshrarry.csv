The doomsday loomed near

He could feel everything but fear

And so when that day the sun finally rose,

He was but full of cheer.

Standing atop, he chanced a glance at the vast serenity

And he smiled truly after what seemed an eternity. 

His eyes were then drawn to the stellar dome; 

Whether the stars nodded their approval or frowned their stark disapproval,

He would never know

For in his mind, he had no care.

The mighty winds roared, as if to topple him

But the earth beneath whispered her welcome 

Calling him to her embrace.

A craven act, he knew for sure 

But an effortless escape it seemed.

And so he leapt, a last gallant move.

Her forces responded at once

The mind raced, the heart almost down to the throat 

But he knew it was all for good.

And so when he finally met the earth,

He gave it all away.

Her touch was warm and smooth did she seem

He smiled one last time and then his gaze fell.

The birds chirped away, alarming the liberation of a soul 

Deadly silence then befall.

Stained in red, he lay there

Silent and still, like those colossal hills

At last, he would be reunited with her 

Reimbursed to all of her facets

Earth, the body he loathed 

Space, the hollow void within

Air, the forced breaths 

Water, the tainted blood and;

Fire, the flame that had burnt out"
