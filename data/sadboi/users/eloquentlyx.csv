I did just land a new better paying job though so things are looking up, not as good as my old one but itll allow me to get an apartment if I can find one that takes dogs in this city.

I never ever wanted to give her up at all, I had to move home for safety after my ex stalked me in a foreign city to the point I had a daily police escorts. My mom was my only choice as I have no other family and had nowhere to go. I had to give up my own place and a job I loved for me and my pup to be safe. I was terrified hed hurt her, i wasnt even that worried about myself."
