The actual measure of the velocity of money *can* give you an idea of how healthy an economy is as people will spend more, and more often, if they feel the feel the economy is good and will remain so. 

But it is mostly dependent on the supply of money.  The problem in capitalist countries, which hampers real revolution seemingly by design, is that virtually all money is created by banks with a future interest obligation attached.  Due to the exponential nature of interest, you have a built-in demand driver and a real problem when people can't take out any more loans to service existing debts. This is the origin of the 2008 financial crisis.  

The reality is when bank lending is ""easy"" the velocity of money increases, and when bank lending decreases, the velocity of money decreases *because people are paying off their debts.*

The decision not to declare war on the Soviet Union is obviously because they considered Germany to be a greater threat.

But they sure are willing to attack without mercy once beloved comedians like George Carlin, Chris Rock, and Jerry Seinfeld.

Personally, while I understand and respect the concept of a safe space for broad discussion, trying to apply the concept to the entirety of humanity is untenable.  As well, it robs us of the power of humor - the contrast between the real and the ideal.

The modern left doesn't really imagine a better world, and therefore can't laugh at the absurdity of the world as it is Now. This should be our greatest propaganda weapon.

The continued legitimacy of capitalism rests solely on deluding the proletariat into believing they can replace all that they have destroyed.  Disproving this lie with facts and logic requires treatise level detail, brevity and research.

But it is absurd to think life under ancient or feudal modes of production were superior.

As for capitalism and imperialism - that is an entirely different topic.  The British Empire was perhaps the most evil in history, but they did not practice slavery as defined by Karl Marx, once they became fully capitalist.  He was writing at the HEIGHT of the British Empire, so he had a very clear understanding of the difference between chattel slavery as what he called the ancient mode of production and capitalist exploitation in factories.  Slavery was obviously still practiced in the Americas during his lifetime, as well as the Ottoman Empire.  Feudalism was still practiced in Russia.  Marx was writing at a unique time where he could see for himself all the various modes of production that existed throughout history. The relationship between capitalism and imperialism is significant, especially if you are in the US. But that is a much more complex topic.

Again, you can post twitter screen captures all day long.  But you are never going to convince anyone of the inevitability of communism unless you understand Marx's Historical Materialism.  Out of all the Marxist concepts, it is not hard.  And it is easy to explain to people.

What makes this more important is true capitalist apologists and advocates, like Libertarians, actually claim that ending of slavery is evidence capitalism is good.

Finally, it's important to understand that Marx makes the argument (and history supports this) that capitalism arose due to the circumstances of history, not because anyone specifically advocated for it.  It arose simply because it was inevitable.

The story of their imposing capitalism on many of these people is actually rather interesting.  Many pre-modern societies didn't understand the concept of having a job for which you were paid.  So, they imposed head taxes.

If you are truly this psychotic to the point you are hospitalized for weeks and given Haldol, one of the strongest antipsychotics available, you almost certainly would qualify for disability and Medicaid.

That said, the problem with schizophrenia is largely patient non-compliance.  You speak of taking Zyprexa negatively complaining of withdrawal symptoms. But all antipsychotics have withdrawal symptoms as all tranquilizers do, including even our beloved alcohol.

If you have experienced this level of psychosis, you should accept being on antipsychotics for life.  Which one you choose should be up to your doctor, but they all have risks.  Zyprexa may have a much higher incidence of metabolic side effects versus Haldol, but it also has a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia.  There are no antipsychotics that don't come with a relatively high risk of serious side effects.  This is the price you must pay for sanity.

The point is, you should not even be thinking of withdrawal.  You only reasonable choices are to be on antipsychotics for life, or continue to experience episodes of psychosis of varying intensity and varying intervals.

I tend to be of a more authoritarian communist bent.  Were the people truly in charge of allocating the means of production fairly, the most reasonable policy would be something like a ""3 strikes"" rule for the psychotic.  If they refuse to take their pills daily, or receive injections bi-weekly or monthly, say three times, they would be committed to a psychiatric ward permanently with many of their rights as citizens revoked.

I am not a residential appraiser, so this is not personal.  But residential appraisal, as a profession, is simply not tenable.  Residential appraisers make terrible money, hence the reason why their numbers have been declining by the thousands for the past 10 years. 

And now that the government has raised the appraisal threshold, unless you live in a top 10 metro area, the vast majority of houses won't even require an appraisal when a federally insured lender makes a loan on it.  

Why did the government decide on this? Are they stupid? No. Huge statistical analyses have been performed over the past decade. Residential appraisals are essentially worthless.  Borrower credit is the sole predictor for default.  Defaulted homes almost never sold for even a reasonable proportion of the appraised value.  Broad regression analyses with a range are far more accurate, and cost nothing. 

Banks will scrutinize sale contracts more in the years ahead so that borrowers like this one don't get screwed by unscrupulous sellers.  Considering most post-war construction nationwide was of low-quality wood frames, actual building engineers who perform property condition assessments will likely be more important than appraisers.   

We hopefully will see government regulations that ban wood-frame housing and broadly encourage urban development, which will in the long term hold value much more easily.  We can expect many if not most distant suburban communities to decline and ultimately be demolished.

What the US does is very unique.  We keep our military stationed all around the world, but most of the time they don't really do anything.  The US operates through ""threat of violence"" as libertarians would say (there are a lot in this thread for some reason) along with foreign aid.  Of course, all the foreign aid we dispense is in dollars, not say food.  

First we try foreign aid and positive diplomacy. If that doesn't work, the threat of violence.  Then finally the bombs start dropping.  

We don't really control any territory anymore, and definitely don't have US companies actually plundering other countries and shipping natural resources home.  Even in Iraq, they sell their oil on the global market.  And there, we have the largest fortress ever built in the history of mankind.  And it's literally where civilization arguably began.
