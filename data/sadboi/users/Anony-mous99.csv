relationships_advice,fr4gxnc,t3_gmlex7,1589887874.0,"Eh no that’s understanding why you wouldn’t... if she’s really mad about that, she’s being immature or maybe upset about something else that effected why she asked that (female here 😅) but really nobody waits that long unless they have some strong beliefs and if you guys are already having sex.. what’s the point? 

It’s a hypothetical.. granted my bf said he’d have sex with about ten people in his famous rooster if he ever met them etc and that had me upset even though extremely unlikely.. (it was the point behind it) 

So you can talk with her and ask why is she upset and how does she think that because you wouldn’t wait 10 years that it means you just want her for sex?"

If there is no court orders yet, find a way to document that (voice recordings if allowed, my state allows one party consent meaning I’m the consenting party and the other doesn’t need to know and as long as private conversation) 

Then leave to your state and file custody. Because if you leave yourself unprotected to a narc they will feast on that and could say you took child without consent and paint a picture of you trying to take away your child and not include the father. Protect yourself."
relationships_advice,fqthcar,t3_gkqb4i,1589639009.0,"Nope. Jeez I have a story about a family reunion and I was about 10 and it was a woodsy area, walking with my brother and first cousin and saw two boys down the road who were cute... well one conversation to another and I find out they’re there for the same reunion! Turns out to be my third cousins and my granny said “just third cousin” 10 year old me said nope! Gross! The word cousin is still in there! 

Sounds like they like each other and inappropriate that she chose to sit on his lap instead of yours. To each their own about choosing a second or third cousin to date but I wouldn’t let myself be tied into that. Like others say.. get out of it bc for one... if she’s doing this in front of you with a cousin.. she would do this with other guys I’m sure too.

relationships_advice,fq8m90d,t1_fq81jq1,1589169545.0,The ideal behind having kids at a month into a relationship doesn’t mean it’s moving too fast. It’s feeling out the other person. There’s no necessarily time line to it and for a reaction of his and comment was totally inappropriate and ass like... maybe he meant nothing truly by it but I think it’s safe to say that they probably won’t mesh well and wouldn’t be a good fit and here’s the flag to leave.

Custody,fq5uvhs,t1_fq5uhk6,1589118057.0,I can understand the legal of it and if able to put it in the agreement to a degree to make it legally enforceable.

Given an emergency situation I should be able to know that and I would 100% give the same respect to that, so it’s not one sided. 

You’d probably want to try to add that to your order so this info is enforceable but unfortunately they may take it as the same as other people here. At least you can enforce the part that is in the agreement. 

A lot of this is just common co parenting and shouldn’t be such a struggle to be told this info. Again personally, I’d have no problem sharing the same info and I do. Good luck with this"

I felt lost and doomed when he threatened to break up and i received most blame and apologized even though he or both of us were at some fault but I got the brute end of it. 

I find writing in a journal has been helping me. Let’s me attempt to organize my thoughts.. realize the good he’s doing for me etc.

I have an extremely short skit written out to keep me focused and not going to go off a rant. And again either way he’s going to get mad. He’s dodging any email or text I send asking about those things and avoiding any straight answers. May be harder to do while on the phone and if he wants to have a tantrum I have it documented that way. 

I won’t be lowering to his level. As I see where you’re coming from, I do, but when I’m being dodged on serious questions, I want to be more straight forward this time and give it a go.

I get updates all the time and photos, my son loves it there and she is VERY clean."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fozqtto,t1_foyyku4,1588195261.0,"It’s just dumb all around. The other two factors to the call was to discuss car seat and my kids bed.. 

In this case I don’t think it would necessarily be rewarding. My kid shouldn’t be in a defective car seat, we had an issue about car seat safety last year, so I’m having to bring it up.. either he gets a new one or he’s giving up his time if he doesn’t have a car seat. 

Same goes for sleeping arrangements. He spent a lot of time making a custom bed yet our kids bed isn’t set up, so apparently he’s been sharing a bed with him when our kids over there.. he’s told me over months how he’s getting the bed put up. 

I’d like to get this updated into a court agreement. And he’s making it easy to not see our kid. Either no shows, doesn’t keep up with essential things as the car seat and bed, so then what ? -.-  I don’t have an attorney, I was screwed by one then went through the state system and got it set up easier but we didn’t go into details about things like a parenting app to communicate through, a 24-48 hour notice of missing time, etc. 

I guess this method would be to get him to-or close to giving his ridiculous excuses and be able to use that in court as well. Proof of missing for less than reasonable reasons, the way he talks and acts, and how he’s going to turn this around to hurt our kid bc he’s mad at me. Either way he’d tank on visitation anyways and this way it just gets him to think more up front about what he’s doing, even if he doesn’t realize it, if he still tries to gaslight, I’ll have the gaslight recorded. Then I go back to my grey rock and leave things be."
Custody,foypx0c,t3_ga954o,1588177000.0,I’m curious about this as well. However my kids dad stopped seeing even before the quarantine really blew up and continuing to do so. About 6 weeks but he didn’t even reach out to get a game plan to agree our kid stays with me or can go and have overnights with his dad. Times he did ask he still didn’t pick up. Curious if courts will let the excuse of a quarantine to not seeing your kids. Mind you there was no FaceTime or phone calls either so no attempt on any level.

Look I’m posting online and not going out into a hundred specific details here but spankings have never been some everyday thing that was done and I moved away from it specifically for that reason of trust, dab of soap, two times and enough just to have a taste, because I thought back old school to see if it would help. So I get it. You hear someone say spank and instantly it’s abuse. That’s exactly what I came searching for was others experiences and what methods work and received info about supernanny, and went full into and wanted to share bc there’s plenty of other parents that have or are in my shoes and trying to shed light on the comment that helped me so I can help others.

I’m not over here pouring loads of soap down my child’s throat. I’m not over here beating him or tying him up... ever read the book “a child called it”? That’s abuse. I’m not abusing my child."
relationships_advice,fo5mn43,t3_g5mqia,1587529493.0,"I don’t see why there’s downvoted for not out saying to just dump him..

Coming from someone who suffers/struggles with mental health.. it can be very difficult in life in many ways that are impacted and weighed harder on us. Or maybe that we take it harder and to find the healthy way out is more of a struggle. These are chemicals in the brain that aren’t functioning right. 

That being said, of course the behavior wasn’t acceptable. Seems like things are at a constant tenseness between you too (yes maybe not everyday but underlying constantly) and he has to find the way to make progress with it. Maybe start writing out one thing he needs to accomplish on his own within a few days (2-3) he’s gone so long of you doing it for him and he’s became use to it and probably taking a sort of advantage but maybe not consciously. Give him these steps to start, next ask him what he thinks he should take care of within the day. (Whether it’s cleaning or filling out a job application, what sort of things can he do to help himself in his current job) start backing off more and more but in steps. This obviously isn’t something you want to continue forever and it’s a chance you both ease off and adjust into. 

Have a talk with him and express that you need things to change and willing to work with him and for each other (that you’re not breaking up but these things are seriously affecting the relationship negatively and there needs to be step towards and need to change) 

If you’re willing to keep going and see if progress can be made, this can make you guys stronger and the bond. He should start seeing a therapist, medications, and be challenged the way he’s thinking about life and everyday tasks in a cautious/helpful/meaningful way to help him see a different perspective. 

If you’re able to find yourself empathetic towards the way a depressed and ptsd person struggles mentally and willing to take a step back with some of your entry/resented emotions that may have developed, and create that serious heart to heart that acts as an eye opener, maybe that can help him be more open. 

Now maybe you’ve already done some or all of that, sometimes we need to be reminded bc we get so wrapped back into those thought cycles and it’s difficult to realize how far it’s gone. A huge factor to all of this though is if he’s truly sorry for the way he’s been treating you because no matter what the circumstances are, it’s not okay to be okay hurting your SO, for it not to bother. I hope he can realize how much you have cared for him and wanting it to work if you’re still there. If he’s not willing to go for a change no matter how small but just start, one thing at a time, if he won’t try to manage/deal with it, we’ll there is only so much someone can take and if it starts seriously breaking you down mentally, then you should go ahead and take a step back and refocus on yourself. You can’t let yourself drown either and if they won’t see the good in a change to try.. sorry for super long here but I really wanted to give some insight on someone who has these mental health issues and try to explain. Again though, it’s still not okay for you to be spoken to like that or made to do everything with no appreciation.

Edit: Maybe even offer up what I’ve just said and maybe hearing it from another’s perspective and experience with it can help. Good luck"
Borderline,fo3dwg0,t3_g5g70n,1587485235.0,"BPD F here and had a horrible toxic relationship for 7 years and the “mother in law” relationship was extremely toxic too. In a new relationship that’s much better.. I have similar anxiety more about how my relationship with his mom will be like. So far so good but definitely anxiety/social anxiety. We’re going on two years and he’s definitely more patient and have had talks recently that we’ll make it through this. 

Being a person with this disorder there’s some steps that should still be taken to not allow the SO to become a big punching bag.. there’s medication.. I was on lamictal which helped a little but off it now bc we want to try for a baby so I’m having more intense mood shifts. I have a playlist on my phone for calming music so I try to go into a different room and listen to it and deep breath and will even lay down and try and take a nap. It can be helpful. (I also have a toddler from that toxic relationship and he’s a handful) I’ve also start to write in a journal and realize the good my bf does and how he helps out, try to keep track of my moods..it’s only been a week but helps to put my thoughts on paper with no judgement, did take time though for me not to judge myself for the dark thoughts. Communication is so tricky and difficult bc I try to not come off in the bitchy tone and try to catch it before it happens or as it is starting. I’ll tell my bf like I’m a 8/10 right now. I don’t like rough affection all the time or when I’m heightened. Bf will try to tickle me to bring my mood up but it can push me further into it. I like sensitive touches like a small neck rub or just putting a hand on my shoulder and being gentle. 

It’s really difficult living with this and I’m no perfect example by any means. For her to realize what she’s doing is step one. Working actively to focus that negative energy elsewhere..would her knowing what days you’ll speak to your family help? And between what times? She shouldn’t have to hear the entire conversation.. it’s controlling and as I can understand her dealing with it myself, she needs to find her way to understand and try to think about what she’s doing here.. sounds like she may have some ptsd mixed with the BPD.. speaking to a therapist would be a good step and be challenged how she’s thinking so she can gain new perspective. To actively think-what does this feel like In the others shoes? 

Maybe have a conversation about how much you love her and how your family doesn’t think bad of her and have her write this down or you write it down as a note and when she starts to flip into that mode,she goes and listens to calming music by herself and reads this note to be reminded. It’s like the clarity looses for some time and need a convo or read something to bring perspective back. It’s tough. And I just want to say thank you on behalf of all BPD strugglers because you seem very understanding and trying here. It’s tough to have this and probably even tougher to be in a relationship with someone with it. Hope something out of this can help you."

I did that and found a good solid friend and one I talk to occasionally.

relationships_advice,fo2pqi4,t3_g5dce3,1587470806.0,This is your first relationship and seems like you guys weren’t on the same page so don’t feel bad.. I dated a guy for four months then dated a guy after for 7 years and we grew apart and on top of that he was a toxic relationship for me. Now I’m with someone who gets me and it’s the best. Sure we still have some fights and whatnot but the majority lines up and want the same things in life. Let this one go. Write down what you realized you wanted out of a relationship and keep that in mind the next time you start to date someone. Realize some things you struggled with but sometimes those issues go away because it was playing off of the other person and things you didn’t like. But also bare in mind.. work on your communication next go around. Communication is key and if there’s something you don’t like you should speak your mind. My first bf for the four months was talking about getting an apartment and marriage and he’s Chaldean so he was gonna stay living with his mom bc that’s their way and I was 16 mind you... no I was not ready for that at all.

At least I conquered that:/ but it can be adjusted through your phone, noise machine and night light and can program times. Bedtime sucked for a long time. Fighting with me, in and out of bed a hundred times. Second night it was clear from there. He heard the sound come on at 8:30 and I say “ooh you hear that?” (Were usually cuddling watching tv by that time and he pauses or shuts off his tablet and listens and smiles and runs to his room to do the routine. My kid is so independent with having to do it all himself, he turns his light off and hops into bed. I let him pick  color and the song and we’re good. (I narrow song to the three lullaby’s and make him tell me a color before I show it to him, otherwise it could take a bit for him to pick) I read a bunch of comments before buying it and saw so many positive and figured worth a shot and better be good because it’s almost 60$ but I tell you momma, it was WORTH IT!"

I’ve worked up giving him a game plan.. he’ll be 3 very soon.. I say “we’re gonna eat some food, go potty, then tickle time. “Or were gonna do laundry (he helps changes loads over) then go eat and then color/paint” also times when I’m trying to fold clothes and he wants to play, I say mommy’s needs to fold clothes then we can play, go play with x,y,z until I’m done. I also put in time so I’d say in ten minutes we can do that. I also start to set timers on my phone so I don’t forget and he knows when the timer is going off it’s time. It’s working pretty well but I also know the me time. That was a big thing for me. My kids dad is practically out of the picture and my bf lives with us and after almost two years I finally came up and said I needed me time and if he could watch him for some time or swap off some days that I get to do what I want and he’s the main guy (I’ve had issues even realizing to ask this so I don’t get overwhelmed and it does feel really weird to do bc I’m so used to being the main source for my son) 

But really the timing thing and letting them know the next few tasks that we’ll do helps a lot. I’m about to adopt the schedule sheet from super nanny and rule sheet too."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fnt8ept,t1_fnt7zy4,1587236608.0,Thanks! That’s pretty much what I’m planning to play out. And I’d probably say how about daddy then his name but if he chooses to say the word dad then that’s up to him. Just curious how others experience played out with it. Glad it worked out easily for you guys! Did you nex ever have an issue with it? Just gonna see how time takes it :)
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fnt7xrb,t1_fnt7k4d,1587236344.0,That’s pretty cool:) yeah I’m not saying I’m making my son call him that but also heard of a family friend in the same boat and eventually her kid called him daddy then name after. Im gonna see how it goes when we have a kid together and see what my son ends up calling him
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fnt7t0w,t1_fnt66sj,1587236273.0,Yeah I get that and I’m not saying I’m going to pressure my son to call him that. Just looking to hear of others experiences. Thanks
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fnt7nvw,t1_fnszxcr,1587236194.0,That’s what I was thinking the daddy then his name after. Represent his dad figure but still by his name too. I don’t see it as that way either but these nexs are sure sensitive. I might just continue as is right now but we’re trying for our own kid so once that time comes probably implement that title since he will be a dad and my son will be hearing it and give it a little more time
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fnsza1o,t1_fnsxz5b,1587231629.0,"Okay thanks, kinda unsure. Uncharted territory.. I never expected to be a “single parent” and not together with the father."
Borderline,fns2yru,t3_g3l5ct,1587210977.0,"Hey good for you! I believe I read your previous post. Keep it up, you’re not alone."
relationships_advice,fnpm9ax,t3_g3512m,1587147983.0,This definitely is abuse and suggest what the other poster said too. Talk to a teacher or reach out to a friend to tell their parents or that neighbor that saw. That’s not okay what he’s doing and it’s horrible that the people that are suppose to protect you are doing this. That your mom backed him up to it. I’m so sorry you’re going through this and it’s going to feel very difficult to reach out because these are your parents but they’ve broken your trust. Please reach out. You’re strong for coming here and you can do this.
relationships_advice,fndfoxo,t3_g1082e,1586868876.0,Or he’s not ready for a relationship yet and needs time to focus on himself
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fncj32a,t1_fncgy3t,1586838040.0,Yup mine just pulled this one. Then plays dumb like he isn’t getting my texts??
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fnc05od,t3_g0v87i,1586825847.0,Mine didn’t try to combat my every other weekend and one day a week for 2 hours. Went through friend of court parenting schedule. Lady even asked him if he’s sure. Has cancelled many times and unreliable and silent treatment. Already gone about 6 weeks of not seeing his kid. Also hasn’t taken any of the week holidays either. Or summer weeks.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fn9wvht,t1_fn9a69v,1586786422.0,Thanks.. I did end up reaching out and yeah was told that I’ve replied to him zero and that he’s been trying to see our kid for a month which he hasn’t. But also how I look at it is my own semi tactic which is checking in with him on parenting time and he went off so just keeping track of how he responds. But I’m not contacting again now. I’m sorry to hear about your situation too. These people just seriously suck..
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fn9rqao,t3_g06hgu,1586782869.0,"Very very good questions, mine just did the same thing. And really I guess the only thing we can do is document it. I really wish there was a better system in play for “parents” like these. Mine said he has been trying to see our son for the last month and implying I don’t let him. Told him to just let me know if I should get our kid ready for pick up and no answer. It’s ridiculous. Yup months of doing well and then out of no where starts drama back up. It’s frustrating. I wish I had better advice. I just document it all in text and no idea if court will even care."
Borderline,fn6ejp0,t1_fn6dyag,1586697091.0,Hmm that’s an idea.. the lamictal doesn’t seem to help a ton but still at a low dose.. well now I’m weaning off because My bf and I are going to try for a baby.. we got through a lot the last few days and have been thinking and waiting for the right time and no time is the right time but we are making it through this and he’d make a great dad. I had been so nervous bc my kids dad is a deadbeat and barely ever sees his kid and my ex and I were not a good gene pool lol bc my kid Is such a handful but I have dreamed of having three kids (definitely probably two now) to raise to be close and take care of each other and have that sibling bond. When I get back on some meds I’m gonna talk with my doc about this. I’ve asked about adderrall because I really think something that can help with my focus would do me good
LifeAdvice,fn6e424,t1_fn5mgat,1586696737.0,"Lol thanks for replying. We have actually had a good heart to heart and I’m starting a journal to keep track of my moods and the things he does for me.. yes weed is legal where I’m at but my bf won’t smoke lol nope. He had a very very bad trip that put him in the hospital and he’s done with that now, I do smoke sometimes and he doesn’t have a problem with it, but honestly weed just makes me so tired usually and isn’t good to do it all the time for me. And I’m out now so... yeah lol.. I’m doing the best with my little one and he’s a happy boy so that’s all I could ask for.. hopefully one day he picks up on being a good listener lol thank you again :)"
Borderline,fn56w5s,t3_fzf19v,1586657374.0,You’re not alone here. I’ve always had maybe one or two friends at a time along with a bf and never really obsessed over friends. I’ve read some posts about people doing that and I don’t believe I have but I just don’t think I was pushed in that way with friends to obsess. I’m more to myself then anything so that might be why. I hate being ignored though and stems a lot from my mom... like I get impatient waiting for a response that doesn’t happen almost instantaneously.. get annoyed easily.. like just now getting into bed and my sheet cover comes off easily and the fan was hitting me too much in the face -.- I’ve started writing in a journal and keeping track of my mood and also in a relationship..so it has been effecting my perception on how things are so keeping track of the things my bf does.. first three days see how it goes but it makes sense! Just need to keep up with it.
LifeAdvice,fn4qqw4,t3_fzkslz,1586646942.0,Hmmm... well.. kinda like that one song that reminds you of something or someone and try to put it into new context and make new memories over it?? Ehh might be a bad analogy bc I literally just heard a song my ex played a bunch and couldn’t get the nasty out of my mouth but .. it’s rewriting your brain here like maybe research all the good about it? Read a lot on it and try to get it familiarized to you with the positive? Take some deep breaths when you start to get that anxiety trigger and find something positive to associate it with or something... that’s all I got.. sorry hope that can make some kind of sense to you..
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fn4oyir,t1_fn46mjq,1586645856.0,"If your circumstances have totally changed I’d go back. Fight that. Do you have proof in text or email or written document saying that it would go to 50/50 after your work is done? I don’t see the hold up to not giving it to you. My bfs brother has 50/50 and he’s in and out of jail, drinks way to much alcohol and doesn’t seem to even care about the kids. What sense does this world make??"
relationships_advice,fn3hzn4,t1_fn3hegp,1586621127.0,"Hmm.. well something I told my ex recently (we have a kid) that I can be frustrated with him and not be an ass bc he responds as an ass all the time and makes emotional jabs to me. So tell her you are frustrated with her and you can be and you’re asking her what she can do to help with the relationship, you’re a team..if she can’t see past that then maybe it’s not right for you because you shouldn’t feel like you have to watch every single word you say to her.."
relationships_advice,fn3h6oc,t1_fn36aw9,1586620661.0,"Everyone does make mistakes and it’s what they do about it that matters most. You’re right about that. As far as the passive aggressive wars.. jeez I’m a woman and I still don’t even know lol. I do it, no holding back, but I’ve recognized it and making efforts not to anymore. I’d say talking about it and being in an open conversation about it. Making sure both people are making a solid effort not to become frustrated and hear each other out. With me it’s after a dumb blow out fight kinda that I sit and realize I’m being irrational and I hear his side of things and it sinks more but for me bc of my mental struggles, I’m now taking it and writing it down so it doesn’t just come through one time then gone and headed right back down the same road. But you don’t have to have a mental struggle to write it down still. I’d ask her to really think this over because she is hurting you a lot too and it’s not fair that you take all the heat. Let her sit with that info. Don’t overload with everything or many examples, just give her the pointers and ask her to please think on it and take a few days and talk again and see where you guys go from there"
relationships_advice,fn2z7jl,t3_fyxl51,1586608451.0,"I think you need to take some steps back. Take your own space here. What she’s doing isn’t right but also being a person that would get mad and not really say anything or let off a paragraph finally and I don’t get the response I’m looking for .. I’ve started to realize that and making my changes. A person needs to want to change though. Communication is key. Does she have any mental health issues? I ask bc I’m borderline personality and it comes with baggage and I have trouble keeping my emotions regulated but I’ve started journaling and keeping track of my emotions and realizing, yes, my bf does stuff for me and I can reflect later and realize if I’m starting to loose clarity. 

Another thing. Great advice given to me.. you teach others how to treat you. If she’s gonna blow up then she gets flowers.. well that’s sending the wrong message. When that happens again, tell her you don’t appreciate being talked to that way and you’re going to take some time to yourself. Let her think on her actions. Her actions need consequences.. you guys can be madly in love but it doesn’t excuse that behavior and maybe she can’t see it because you do those cute things and try to make up when you weren’t the one in the wrong. Cute things should be done to be cute not when you might be in trouble. Take space and let her sit on this. Send her a message and explain pretty much what you said here.. minus the annoying part.. you don’t want to put a ton of bad emotions into it. Just let her know that she may be upset with you but you don’t deserve to be lashed out to, you’ve asked for open communication and try to talk without placing the blame. You need time to think and leave it as that. Let her think it over and see how she responds to that."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fn2yacs,t1_fn2bot1,1586607610.0,All text messages.. do you have a recommendation for phone recording?? I’ve recorded some but not much. Had a really good and juicy one with him admitting he doesn’t want to text me in scare of me using against court and saying how his crazy gf had beat him up and everything and the phone I used didn’t get it!! So idk what I should use... yeah silent treatment is perfect wording.. like dealing with a child.. and that’s exactly what he’s doing. He was fighting with me on who ignored who and meanwhile I just told him to let me know if I should get our kid ready and no response. Do you even care? This is headed on his longest streak of not seeing his kid..
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fn23f1m,t1_fn21t78,1586576800.0,You’re the expectation it seems.. more and more these days. Is it court order that you have it set up that way? I was told by my attorney I got super lucky with this set up (he didn’t even fight for more time) he gets every other weekend and two hours during the week and still has missed many of those days since our order has been in place.. about 1.5yr into the order..
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fn22xse,t1_fn1s9io,1586576441.0,"Thank you.. yes I do document like crazy and keep 99% of communication in text message. He buries himself with they way he responds.. my court order doesn’t have that notice in it.. I’ve been contemplating bringing us back to court to get this and a couple other things in the order but nervous that he’d try to fight in custody or something idk. I know they’re different hearings for what I’d be bringing up to custody and I feel 95% sure he wouldn’t even try. He didn’t combat the custody order which was every other weekend and two hours out of the week. I’ve talked to an attorney and they said I got really lucky with this order. I know it’s not my job and I tell myself that and even preach to others about it. I guess call it a semi tactic bc I keep the door open for him to man up and he never does and I get that constant decline from him so often it’s his habit. I did hold back on his weekly visitation with not even reaching out.. after today, yeah I’m back on the whatever train and not expecting him to take up his parenting time."
Borderline,fn22b1q,t1_fn1qr8r,1586575978.0,I think the journaling is a great idea and I’m already really liking it..(probably for now lol..) it’s a process learning that you were with a narcissist and coming to terms with it. You will feel like they’re a great person and maybe if you weren’t the way you are that things would have been better etc but that’s the lie in your head. And I can 100% confident about that because I found someone that isn’t like that and much happier..now not saying everything is rainbows and pony’s because I do struggle with this but we’re working through it.. you will find someone. Take this time to heal and focus on you and just recognizing yourself and that will most likely be a long term thing but it’ll make it easier when you find someone that fits with you because you can explain things about yourself more clearly.. I’m glad I can give you some hope :) we all need a little hope in our lives. My bf put it to me to chase the happiness. Try to remember that. Make a note in your journal. You’ll have your bad days but if you can remember that hope to find happiness maybe it’ll sting a little less
Parenting,fn1ny5w,t1_fn1goxa,1586566117.0,Same here!! Right at the hinge is where mine stuck his hut omg I think I’d freak if it was a big metal door at those apartments! Those are heavy duty! So glad your kiddo is okay!
LifeAdvice,fn1nuwu,t1_fn17v97,1586566060.0,"Good advice, but wanted to point out that what happened to you was too, emotional abuse. Manipulating you to feel you need to crawl back and putting all the blame on you all the time.. heads towards that category."

Borderline,fn0omku,t3_fyltti,1586545810.0,"I get the stigma feeling :/ my therapist brought up borderline several months back and I’ve actually been diagnosed with cyclothymia which they’re similar but researched borderline and realize that feels way more fitting.. I felt the stigma myself.. shoot I’ve even thought the stigma before realizing more about it.. also took a lot of psych classes too.. idk if that’s more benefit or not, I like to think it is. I was in a toxic relationship 7 years and he was my first serious relationship.. now going 2 years with much better guy but feel I’m actually having some issues I’m bringing into ours and kinda hits that’s maybe the narcissist ex wasn’t all to blame. My bf has been pretty patient with me and made some breakthroughs recently, so don’t think you can never find someone else that will appreciate you more. 

I just started a notebook.. like a diary.. and I keep track of dates and times and put my mood down and just the random intense thoughts that come through during the day but also making note what my bf is doing around me to show he’s helping more than I can remember as time goes on and I start manifesting issues with how we are and feeling like I’m doing it all.. well this will hopefully help realize he does do things and keep reminding myself and also being able to see how times go and can be realistic when I’m starting to feel that way. Kinda helps keep the info straight and make sure I’m not making things up in my head.. hope this could help you too."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fmzoqqb,t1_fmzmxq7,1586526217.0,Glad I could help with it. It does just suck that we have to play out twenty different responses to try to minimize the backlash from them.. you’re right about his communication though. Sad that they rather get a rise out of the other parent verses actually caring about their kids.. good luck!
relationships_advice,fmzl0j3,t1_fmyw7kf,1586523504.0,"Thank you for your reply! Lol I was thinking I’d get a lot more tips and help with the virus putting us all in the house but nope ha. 

That’s a really good idea. We’ve been kinda rocky and he’ll give me space but that’s not really what I want.. for me I like a gentle touch, like a neck rub for two minutes.. he did it in the beginning and I was sooooo surprised that I just calmed down.. I was in a really bad relationship for a long time before us and I never had any where near this level of attention he will give me. We had a talk yesterday and things are on the mend and I guess a part of me was wanting to be accepted for who I am with this and I asked him if he believed me about these issues and he said he does and that in itself just kinda gave my soul something I’ve been dying for...

I’ve started to write down in a notebook about my day and my mood and what my bf is doing for me so I can remember when I’m not in a clear mind, that I love this guy and he is great and what I need to do to get help without coming off crazy bitch attitude about it.... I’m lost on my diagnoses now but I tell you it’s nice to hear someone with the same one! My therapist brought up borderline with me too which has very similar symptoms as cyclothymia and starting to wonder for myself.. he also gave me a perspective ... well he says I’m a glass half empty kind of person .. which ya.. I am.. expect when I’m in a high mood and thinking this job I’m working at can make me thousands haha.. now I’m down so idk about that but anyways.. he said to chase the happiness.. when I’m feeling depressed or down to remember happiness and focus on what can I do to reach that today. Or focus on making my kid laugh or something and I see that. I’m a believer in if you can change the way you think, you can change your behavior.. that’s a long process but I’d like to say I’ve come a long way from five years ago... thanks for reaching out and if you ever need to talk feel free to message me bc it’s nice to connect with someone with the same things going on."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fmzk42r,t1_fmyjgma,1586522795.0,"Yup, I got the crazy and paranoid and a controlling card from him. Probably the best advice I can carry over is to respond with “ok” .. the I don’t care would definitely be taken as an attack from them (dumb I know) but if he goes off spieling some bs about how you never give him good updates etc. Just say ok. What else is there to say? “Ok” it’s neutral and he’ll probably still take it the bs route but if it goes back to court then it doesn’t show your instigating anything ya know? Keep it basic like : sleeping good, potty training well, getting good grades. That’s it. You’re not here to coax his ego anymore and in court eyes, you’re giving him the info and you don’t need to be buddy buddy about it. 

Out of curiosity, what’s your court order set as? Why is this guy only reaching out once a month? I mean nothing too much to complain about bc you don’t have to deal with him on a weekly basis or anything but just curious."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fmyhetx,t3_fy3esm,1586486238.0,"Yup. During this pandemic, I’ve given times and the days to FaceTime for him to talk to our kid and never happened. Well see this weekend and that goes but not thinking it’ll go through. It’s been 5+ weeks since my nex seen his kid and that was only a two hour visitation not even his weekend. I feel for you. I’d really suggest to stop answering him... maybe idk. It’s shitty for us to have to go through several outcomes and pick the best worst case scenario. If you stop replying (and it sounds like there isn’t a court order?) then he may fight that harder bc he’s loosing even more control of that rise out of you...Well another perspective is finding peace with his actions. You can’t control how someone is going to respond but you can control how you respond. Even though you’ll feel the anger and frustration..eventually it’ll lessen and continue to lessen  .. with him only reaching out once a month it gives you some time in between to rebalance yourself after having to deal with him. Maybe write out three responses in your notes to how you respond with the update. Keep it short and only about your kid and no emotions to it and civil. Then keep records of all messages too bc if anything ever becomes of this you have the proof to back up you giving him options to reach your kid.. good luck and hope this can help. It’s helped me back off so much. We can tell them all day long on how they should care about the kids but isn’t going to change anything and only going to make us more frustrated and angry. I caught myself the other day wanting to say something to my kids dad and instead I just wrote it in my notes and set it aside and didn’t say a word.. they don’t deserve explanations or reasons."

I’ve been wishing for time to not have to go into work and here it is.. probably not the best circumstances but I’m in relief.. also giving me time to find a work from home flexible job to give me hope of not needing to go back go work at the place i hate..
mentalhealth,fmupufb,t1_fmuopea,1586396304.0,"Thank you for that... it sucks because he is really good but our communication just lacks and not that we both don’t try but we don’t see eye to eye on a lot or take things wrong. I’ve brought up therapy even specifically for sake of having him tell them what he views of me and get it filtered and allow the therapist to hear what I may never recognize or mention and allow me to work on those things. 

He’s done some really nice stuff, he does, but I’ve pointed out I don’t like being tickled when I’m in my heightened mood.. gentle touches with a soft kiss would work great.. and I went and laid it out simply like that one day and expressed I was at an 8/10... he just walked away from me.. later told me that he needed to walk away and think bc he would have said something wrong or something but by him just walking away that made me feel ignored and I just opened up and was vulnerable and he walked away? It sucks bc with the borderline personality I go back and forth between wanting a future and kids and a house to thinking this just isn’t going to work.. these are big things around my mental health then to thinking of me being alone scares me (I have a toddler too..) and yeah it just sucks. The average regular non mental health girl would love this guy and he’d be so perfect. He wants a kid so bad but I’m unsure how I’d do with another but part would still like one more but not in another broken relationship.. ugh."
mentalhealth,fmuoojm,t3_fxdzw9,1586395610.0,"You’re already going the right direction by asking this question. 

As being the one with the mental health struggle. I’d suggest reading up on their specific diagnosis and also looking at how to be in a relationship with someone with it. Discuss how things can come up and what kind of things can be done to help. 

My personal example.. I can become irritated and moody and I don’t like loud noises in that state or to be rough housed with.. what helps? A gentle touch, maybe a back rub and kiss on the cheek. 

I’ve been pretty depressed before and never had it happen with my ex but something I think could have helped was to just be told how I had someone there for me to listen, who would help clean up when I was so lacking of energy or drive to even make my bed or take a shower. 

Don’t shoot down therapy. If that gets brought up ever it most likely is to help build some communication or for me I’d have liked to try so I can hear it from another perspective and have the third party filter it so I can understand and know it’s something that needs to be discussed privately as part of keeping stable. 

Hope that can help and good luck, it can be hard but don’t loose sight why you like/love this person."

BipolarReddit,fmi5eu2,t3_fvabf9,1586102783.0,"Been working roughly 30-39 hours a week for the last 7 years. I work about a year to two at each job before I find something wrong and irritating about the job. I usually get that feeling after three months but need money so I stick to it until I’m going crazy. I tend to call off or tardy often. Went three months without calling off at current job then had several times I called in. Some of it was bc my kid is sick or emergency at daycare and had to pick up, others I wasn’t mentally good that day or sick. Tardy often and start to feel insecure at the job like nobody likes me or talks about me etc. I’ve found personally, I’m tired of working an office job. I’m tired of 9-530/9-7 and working three Saturday’s out of four a month. I’ve just started with a company at home job, it’s a 1099 and I build my own hours. It’s a cross between a sams club and regular super store, I sign people up. We will see how this goes. Potential to earn good money and flexible to my hours. Also working at becoming a realtor but classes are postponed obviously due to co19. Another type that can work around my schedule and make decent money. We will see how these two jobs take off and how I do but I think it would be better for me. Unemployed at the moment but when this lifts up, I’m hoping to be able to quit within a few months (also working on buying a house which means I need that w2 history that I have) 

I feel for you though.."
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fm5i3q8,t1_fm4ndkn,1585773376.0,Well so that means your out of paying this amount? He can’t have you pay outside of the business like that so.. I’d try to research that. Idk about talking with a lawyer for consultation or speaking with the broker directly to figure this out. Or should be on him to receive his payment and speak with broker. Sorry can’t give much advice on this.

sex,flxac3y,t1_flwpias,1585578833.0,I can’t remember the exact conversation but we’d be talking about something random or tickling me lol and just instant boner... it could be a convo about something weird and he says how he’s getting turned on and no matter what I say next it’s still doing it for him lol.
