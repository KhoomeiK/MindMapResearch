psychotherapy,fqrp054,t1_fqrmsmp,1589588853.0,Thank you sharing!! I feel like the theme of surprising ourselves with the population we think we don’t want to work with becoming our favorite seems to be a common thing! This post has really created an interest for me to step outside my comfort zone :)

I do think many of them have the fantasy that they’re going to “save” children or have a special/unique bond with the child and I think that’s probably not the healthiest way of conceptualizing it anyways"
psychotherapy,fqpkjm8,t1_fqpk4v7,1589548556.0,Amazing—thank you so much! I’ve actually never heard that before but it makes total sense as just coloring has been a huge tool of healing and alleviating dissociative symptoms for myself personally. Have you ever struggled with kids who had parents that refused to either cooperate with treatment or just knowing that they were harming the child? I think that would be a huge test of boundaries and ethics for me.
psychotherapy,fqpkbef,t1_fqpjyx6,1589548410.0,Thank you so much for posting this!!! You make such a great point because I never assumed I would love working with couples as much as I realized I do! It’s so funny how we end up finding our strengths in areas we never thought we would!
psychotherapy,fqpjude,t1_fqpj9s6,1589548106.0,"Thank you so much for this!!! I LOVE kids and I think part of my fear maybe comes from my own childhood issues. A big part of my passion in this field is working to heal wounds from childhood, so I definitely think shadowing a child therapist is a great idea. I love the idea of working with teens—I think you made a good point because maybe some of the fear comes from seeing how many clinicians choose not to work with kids."

psychotherapy,fp26ejt,t3_gamy8n,1588256073.0,"Hi! Fellow student here and I just took a psychopharmacology class (it ended up being my favorite). From what I learned, the pharmacological aspects of the drug are essentially the functional mechanism of the drug. 

For example, the functional mechanism of Adderal is to increase norepinephrine and dopamine, which is thought lacking in a those with ADHD.  That is the pharmacological aspect in which does not vary human to human—dopeamine and norepinephrine increase regardless of the individual diagnosis. A person who took adderall who has ADHD vs someone who does not may experience different psychological (euphoria, anxiety) or physiological (appetite-loss, dry mouth) effects, but the pharmacological mechanism remains the same."
psychotherapy,fo44z7r,t3_g55e1c,1587498284.0,"This is such a good idea! When explaining the process of healing passed trauma, I actually use a metaphor that my own therapist used to explain it to me. I talk about how when trauma happens to us, either physical or emotional, it creates a wound. If we have not taken care of the wound, or have slapped multiple bandaids over the wound, it’s likely to be infected, festering and angry. Any time we touch this wound, the pain is intense. In order to treat with this wound, we may have to scoop out the infection, clean it, and go through an uncomfortable process. But eventually with treatment the wound will heal up and form a scar, which we can touch and remember the wound, but it no longer causes us pain."

Being a student and trying to navigate that aspect makes things highly confusing sometimes, as well as being on the other end and trying to find a therapist. Pretty much every therapist I see lists psychodynamic under the approach, but I’ve struggled to find a therapist who doesn’t just default to CBT or solution-focused."
psychotherapy,fk5a4vg,t1_fk59ed8,1583876437.0,"Thank you so much!! This is exactly what I was trying to figure out. I think what was hanging me up is seeing a lot of therapists in PP on psychology today listing “DBT” under the treatment approach area, but it confused me because DBT seems to be very well-defined and specific. Kind of like how you wouldn’t say you did TFCBT unless you were certified, but I guess saying DBT is easier than saying a “dialectical approach”"

My boss is super focused on relationships and will have me personally deliver thank you letters for every referral, and always coordinates care with doctors. Some of the therapists do super well, others do really poor—the ones who work with couples always do well though, and because they will refer to another therapist for individual too, the practice makes so much from them, it’s kind of shocking."
psychotherapy,fjrr0e3,t1_fjrnavg,1583589064.0,"Thank you for replying!! That makes a lot of sense—the founder of the practice I work for does tons of self marketing/community outreach/public speaking things and she is so incredibly in demand she only takes self-pay now. I totally get the niche, that makes sense. I’m excited to explore that for myself. 

I worked in an adult store for 7 years and throughout undergrad, and I’m interning in inpatient—but I will be joining the group as a registered intern and really want to focus on sexuality. I have been to so many sexual health seminars, but if I want to market myself that way it feels like I’d have to go and get a phd in sexology. I guess I could just call myself sex positive?"

BPD,fhv1xfp,t3_f4x9sa,1581892434.0,"I have BPD (quiet type, and technically “in remission” after lots of therapy), I have a bachelors degree and am currently working on my masters. I’m studying clinical social work, after I graduate I plan to become a licensed therapist and I plan to become DBT certified. I think having BPD has actually been an incredible asset in my educational career. I will say this—I started school slightly late. I’m 28 now and I started at 23. I failed high school and ended up getting a GED, my symptoms were much much worse back then. But considering the field I am going into, I think having BPD has been a positive, and Vice versa. School helped me develop a sense of self and confidence I never had before, and having BPD has given me the understanding and compassion for BPD individuals, which so many clinicians don’t have. Marsha Linehan, the psychologist who created DBT, has BPD herself. 

Good luck in school!! I highly suggest utilizing any free counseling thats available at your school and of course, find a good therapist. By the way, I have a 3.9 GPA :) study something that you really love, and I believe it will help with your BPD in more ways than you might think."

Even after, there was a lot of chaos in my life and my memory is pretty poor as I have a big issue with dissociation, but certain trauma therapies have helped. “Unblocking” is a good strategy to start picking up memories. The kind of come up when you start on a trail. You do have to focus on at least one memory, even small, so you can try to get in touch with that part of your brain. 

Sometimes in therapy, I’ll speak the memory and it literally comes out of my mouth before my mind has even caught up to actually remembering it, so I’ll stop and be like “woah” and have to process the memory. My therapist thinks it has a lot to do with dissociation, kind of blocking out memories from my conscious mind but the rest of my mind/body does remember."

BPD,fbzmoix,t3_efc0v2,1577251981.0,"WOW I(28F) resonate with this so so so SO much. I have an issue with people pleasing to a near pathological degree, and I’m now getting my masters degree to become a therapist—which strangely is both very healing and at the same time scares me because I know the unhealthy places I often go. On one hand, I think of my ability to analyze behavior and empathize is a talent that I can master and use for good, on the other—I worry about my own insight and how much of it is still lacking. I go to great lengths to portray myself as a person who does not need the approval of others, and I think most people are convinced. But it’s literally the only thing that drives me through life. I’m perfectionistic and focus a lot on my looks while pretending like I don’t care about it at all. 

I constantly hyper-focus on the needs of others, even when I don’t realize it, and become extremely anxious if I feel like they are exhibiting any kind or negative or even neutral response to me—even if I actually don’t like the personal all that much. I’ve had sex when I didn’t want to a few times because I got anxious and couldn’t speak, and I got worried that the person would be bored with me or think I was weird. 

If it’s a person I idealize (usually only romantic interests), it obviously is much more intense, but I still don’t show it. I always just figure out a way to be exactly what they need, while pretending like that’s just who I am. I will go to great lengths to study and analyze the things they like, their attachment style, sexual interests, etc and make it my driving force to be the perfect embodiment of whatever that is. I feel like while I have developed a stronger sense of self through therapy, I don’t think I’ll ever not struggle with this. Did you ever see Gone Girl?

I mean have you heard NWA’s “just don’t bite it”? 


And since many of us develop our sexual selves in an environment that breeds toxic shame, blowjobs are often enjoyed by both women and men for their (potentially) degrading nature. I love being held by the head throatfucked with my hands behind my back, but that’s because I, like many, enjoy the feeling of somewhat used and degraded during sex—which is a form of shame.

If women view it as degrading, it’s because men do too. And also—it’s okay to enjoy kinky sex too."

sex,f0p4o2u,t3_d5xs56,1568827105.0,"My theory is that it’s because a lot of people’s sexual desires are based off of shame and repression. 

While working in an adult store for seven years, I noticed a lot of trends about what type of person bought what type of porn. For example: the majority of those who bought interracial (bm/wf) porn where white men over 60. My theory is that the idea of black men fucking white women is something that is more rooted in taboo in the brains of these older white men, than it is in younger people. 

Seeing something that is “wrong” becomes in and of itself a sexual characteristic, because people are often conditioned to believe sex is wrong and shameful. Based on any number of a persons experiences, what they subjectively find to be most taboo will change. But incest is universally taboo, which is why I think it gets the biggest following."

Sometimes it can be hard when you’re used to a toxic relationship where boundaries aren’t present because it’s easy to mistake a lack of boundaries as intense love. Society already tends to glorify boundary-less love and associate it with passion. 

Empathy is also something that I never experienced in any abusive relationship, and I don’t think the two can really every be (for the most part) mutually present. But the boundaries are a one, and they set the pace of a slow building, healthy relationship. All of the most toxic relationships I’ve been in started out super intense, and that blurred emotional line between partners."

Try reality checking—what is the likelihood that anyone else even recalls these moments or that they perceived them in the exact same way you did? When have you ever ruminated over a small detail about something that another person did? No two people perceive things the same way, and remember that our view of reality and ourself is inevitably distorted by the uniqueness of individual development.

Also be self-compassionate. Would you judge another human for the same things you are cringing at yourself over? I know most of the time I wouldn’t. Turn that compassion inward. You are a human and no one is perfect."

mentalhealth,ertq74u,t1_ertq25d,1561249880.0,"You did the exact same thing. Many = 3 people, including you."
mentalhealth,ertpf73,t1_ertohjg,1561249206.0,Of course diagnoses are constructs built by language. All they are are ways to bill insurance and speak clinically about clusters of symptoms. However the state of experiencing bipolar mania is not a construct. There’s more than enough distinction.
mentalhealth,ertpao9,t1_ertp7ji,1561249098.0,"YES, why do you continue to reiterate that context is necessary? It is clear that what I am talking about is NOT simply the use of the word “mania.”"
mentalhealth,ertnn8t,t1_ertn1r9,1561247694.0,"I’m sorry that I didn’t word it properly. I didn’t mean that mania was gross. I meant the romanization of mania, is gross."
mentalhealth,ertmbnn,t1_ertln46,1561246577.0,"That’s okay, people are allowed to disagree with me. I didn’t word things as best as I could’ve because I saw something online that triggered a rant, and it was all just a stream of consciousness."
mentalhealth,ertl7lq,t1_ertkpby,1561245624.0,"I don’t hate you, but idk. I feel like BPD is an incredibly stigmatized illness, sadly."
mentalhealth,ertl5zn,t1_ertkh9d,1561245585.0,"I’m sorry that your going through a rough patch rn. It’s really hard to find a therapist you connect with. And it’s even harder when you have BPD because there’s a ton of stigma that revolves in the clinical realm itself. I’ve seen/heard a lot of really stigmatizing things being said about some of the hospital patients with BPD, by loads of licensed therapists. The assumption that self harm is only done for attention is still very present. People with BPD can be difficult to work with sure, but I wish the “untreatable” falsehood would just disappear already. Treatment can provide incredible results for people with BPD—who are amongst some of the most compassionate and lovely individuals I’ve ever met. I also hope that new research will help us understand why so BPD is so often misdiagnosed, especially in men. 

And no, of course you don’t want to trigger a patient in terms of trauma, especially not if you’re doing trauma work together. I just meant many therapists use anger/reactivity as a tool in therapy, to get to issues that the individual may not be completely aware of."
mentalhealth,ertj46t,t1_erthwzu,1561243882.0,"You took what I was saying out of context, multiple times. I have ADHD too, so no, I won’t be condescending, and I was never condescending towards your diagnoses in the first place. 

It’s interesting you assume that I don’t also suffer from mental illness. I don’t really feel like I should have to offer a rap sheet of my diagnoses, but I have MDD, ADHD, and complex PTSD—which is actually quite similar in presentation to those with BPD.  

I am aware sensitivity is a symptom. Individuals with BPD are a population I’m extremely passionate about working with..however, people get angry and upset at their therapists quite often—if you look, many therapists actually consider this a positive thing. It’s opportunity to explore personal triggers and potentially get to the core causes. Therapists aren’t here to make you temporarily feel better. They’re here to facilitate self growth, learning, awareness, and healing. 

You can be mad at me but I’ll still advocate for you!"
mentalhealth,ertgsqb,t1_ertgg5i,1561241962.0,"Lol, I’m a survivor of chronic childhood sexual abuse, who has been through years of my own therapy, and I already have taken trauma courses and CEUS, but I shouldn’t feel the need to prove anything to you. You came on here mischaracterizing me, telling me to shut the fuck up, and telling me maybe I’m “young,” which could be argued that you’d imply that it has to do with my lack of knowledge. 

I am also a human, whom you know nothing about, and you don’t just get to come on here and talk shit to me, then act as though because you have a mental illness it’s acceptable. And no, you did in fact imply that people with a mental illness are “sensitive” or unable to understand context. I never insulted you and I hope you have a good day."
mentalhealth,ertfmkl,t1_ertfjij,1561241008.0,You’re not my patient and I don’t have to speak to you in any type of way. This is reddit. But are you implying that people with mental illnesses are weak and over sensitive?
mentalhealth,ertfitj,t1_ertfbar,1561240925.0,"I’m not acting as a gatekeeper here though, I just don’t appreciate serious illnesses being treated so trivially. I’m being respectful of your opinions while politely disagreeing and standing my ground."
mentalhealth,ertfdlg,t1_ertf2ef,1561240809.0,"You can have whatever you want, and I’m glad that the romanization/portrayal of these disorders allows you to feel empathized with and that you’re utilizing it as a positive coping skill. However, there’s more people in this world than you, and that shit hurts people. When someone wants to kill themselves because they’re mental illness doesn’t live up to the “cool” version they see as acceptable in society, I take issue with that. Bye!"
mentalhealth,ertf3yn,t1_ertdsna,1561240595.0,"Treatment resistant in the realm of both psychotherapy and psychiatry. They don’t tend to seek help or want help, and the basis for my opinion stems from people looking at things like this and not understanding what illnesses actually look like or feeling bad about themselves when they don’t meet the standards of the “cool” version."
mentalhealth,ertewki,t1_ertepcm,1561240435.0,"And no, I don’t have bipolar. I guess the tens of thousands of dollars and time spent studying mental illness means nothing if I don’t have that diagnosis. Also—one bipolar person isn’t the gatekeeper for the disorder. You don’t speak for every bipolar person."
mentalhealth,ertersl,t1_ertepcm,1561240331.0,"I’m sorry it wasn’t clarified well enough for you, but the majority of individuals on this post understood what I meant."
mentalhealth,ertem5n,t1_ertdzrf,1561240208.0,"Also sure, I don’t believe people with mental illness should be portrayed as freaks and monsters, at all. But when the constructs of “mania” or even “BPD” are attached to items that are “cute” or “cool,” the individuals who don’t meet those criteria are left to feel even more isolated."
mentalhealth,ertecu8,t1_ertdzrf,1561240006.0,"I have a bipolar parent with a substance use disorder. 

Why does gross bother you? Did you think I was calling people with bipolar gross? Because it’s the trivialization I find gross.

And no, I won’t STFU because I’ve had enough discussions with people with mental illness who are legitimately upset at watching people who don’t suffer talk about being depressed or manic while others are unable to function in their daily lives."
mentalhealth,ertdicp,t1_ert8dzb,1561239328.0,I’m sorry you’re family is going through that rn :/ it’s very hard on everyone.
