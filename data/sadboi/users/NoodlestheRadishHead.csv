I will need 2 weeks off to heal each tattoo, so should I space them out so that the 2 weeks off is not so ""detrimental"" if you will? I might get a couple at a time to minimize time off. I could get two next month and then the remaining two near my moving date. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!

Please let me know if I should move this to a more appropriate thread or make a separate post! Happy new year everyone :)"

LadiesofScience,fd049pc,t3_ejirsb,1578113404.0,"I failed my first year qualifying exam as well! A PhD is a path made of failures. I‚Äôm a 6th year and if I took everything I learned and redid everything, I could probably do all the experimentation and publication writing in a year or two. It‚Äôs the process and the oh shit‚Äôs and the failures that teach you to be a researcher. Granted, an environment like this is not for everyone. Grad school is made so much better when you have a good support system in and out of the lab. Personally, I‚Äôm glad I had the rug completely tugged out from under me so early. It helped me learn to cope when I had to drop all my (very unsuccessful) projects two years later and completely start on a new (much more successful) project. Feel free to reach out! And for what it‚Äôs worth, I think it‚Äôs rare to find a field you enjoy AND are good at. Sincerely, a 6th year PhD chemE who works in molecular bio too :) I‚Äôm sending you good vibes in whichever venture you take!"
