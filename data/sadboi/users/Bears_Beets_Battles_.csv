I’d try to minimize both to the extent you are able while maintaining your mental health. Lately it can be more important sometimes to just calm down your CNS when needed. 

I think you’re ok I would just be careful, try not to get too regular or up it. Cut back if/as you can. I can’t say scientifically one is impacting your dependence on the other but that is my sense since they seem to have a similar effect. I’m glad you are able to moderate, some of the stories I read here I really feel for people. Your doses and frequency aren’t that high. 

Can you drink a few times a week and take benzos a couple times a week, without creating dependence? Maybe. Imho, probably. I think it depends on you more than physical dependence. But I am not a pharmacist/doctor."
benzorecovery,fojq9r4,t1_fojp9w0,1587827080.0,"I wouldn’t concern myself too much with what is normal (especially if that’s food, video games, sugar and carbs). I think you know yourself, can think about what you want and make decisions accordingly. 

Also try not to be hard on yourself for how you’re coping. You’re not abnormal. Liquor stores are doing a roaring business, suicides are up, domestic violence is up. 

Your life doesn’t need to be compared to anyone’s curated highlight reel. Just do what’s best for you. You did well before and you can and will again, if that’s what you want. I really wish you the best, I think you’re gonna be fine."

benzorecovery,foji2m6,t3_g7t61a,1587821493.0,"2-3 weeks of intermittent use of each isn’t the end of the world and shouldn’t make you physically addicted in my opinion. But you are walking up to that line where it could get bad again and I think maybe you agree and that’s why you’re asking. 

I have also found that one will do the others job. I was watching Burt Kreishner the other day and he said “it’s like when you take a Xanax - ahh this is what normal people feel like”.  Total aside, but I laughed. (He is a notorious drinker btw). Our brains crave GABA and that’s what we are getting. 

It just comes down to what can you do right now? What do you *want* to do? It’s entirely understandable you are doing this lately. A lot of people are. 

Just think about the life you want to live and how you feel. 

Personally I think you could CT safely at 2-3 weeks if that’s what you want to do or is easier for you. Alternately, take your foot off the gas on both, start pumping the brakes and fill your life with more activities that make you feel good. Delay, distract, and cut it back. 

I hope that’s somewhat helpful."

For example, NY has mostly tested people sick in hospital. RI is tiny. How many tests are just scared people, because there is a plethora of tests?
