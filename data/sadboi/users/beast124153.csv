The government should set something up to where you have to be verified to adopt or purchase any pet specifically to avoid domestic animal attacks. Fearing and hating pit bulls won‚Äôt benefit anything, though. Eventually, there‚Äôs a possibility that it could lead to some form of war and end with dogs/wolves becoming the dominant race.

BanPitBulls,eu6wiuu,t1_eu6ulrd,1563510850.0,"Nothing just sets a pit off, they learned to be aggressive because they grew up in an aggressive environment, they aren‚Äôt just ticking time bombs like you think, they are living creatures just like the rest of us, walk a mile in their paws, see how it feels to be feared like them. I bet they have it worse than you, constantly feared while you sit behind your computer or phone screen looking at news articles about rabid pit bull attacks, then coming here to shame the entire breed because you saw one bad dog, not all pit bulls act that way. I have a pit bull who couldn‚Äôt hurt a fly, and do you know why, because my family raised her right, we gave her a friendly environment where we play with her, feed her the perfect amount, and give her occasional dentastix. The majority of pit bulls are good, despite what the 1800‚Äôs or even earlier may have told you, evolution and adaption is a thing and it does happen. Yes, pit bulls were trained to be aggressive, a very long time ago, that‚Äôs changed now, now most people know how to care to their dog and make them a friendly dog, occasionally you will see a dog that has rabies or grew up in a bad environment, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the entire breed is bad. Pit bulls shouldn‚Äôt be banned, certain people should be banned from owning one, and to moderate that, have everyone take some form of test before adopting one, and to make it fair, make that the case for all pets, then no more bad owners. And it would have to be an advanced enough test to where you couldn‚Äôt lie or speed through it just to get your hands on a pet, have it heavily moderated and strict specifically to avoid domestic animal attacks. Fearing and hating them won‚Äôt do anything though. It‚Äôll just make it worse for humans."
