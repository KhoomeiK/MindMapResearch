AMA,fi0cjf2,t1_fi0auhx,1582033511.0,"Apologies in advance for how long this is gonna be.

Found it! So right off the bat I have a couple concerns. Generally speaking foaming cleansers are too harsh on the skin because they use sulphate (the second ingredient) in order to get the lather. This ingredient is used in dish soap and is very drying on the skin. And then after stripping the skin you're not replenishing with a moisturizer.

What your skin then does is go ""oh no all my oils, protection, and hydration are gone! I have to fix this fast!"" So it makes more oil than it should, often leaving you feeling oily or greasy and clogging pores leading to breakouts and larger looking pores. So by hydrating the skin it doesn't feel the need to produce oil and kills two birds with one stone.

As far as reactions go it can be difficult to determine their cause. First thing to look at is what type of reaction is it? Redness, burning/ itching, rash? This is a sensitivity or reaction. This is when you want to stop using a product immediately. Products causing breakouts can be a little more difficult. 

So purging is a process in which the skin will get rid of any pent up dirt/ pollutants/ sebum etc. This will come in the form of breakouts. The best way (unfortunately) to tell the difference between purging and reacting is to wait. Because the skin takes ~28 days to renew only after that month will you know for sure it's not purging. However if you never get a particular type of breakout like cysts/nodules then you tray a product and 3 days later you suddenly do that's not a super promising sign.

So what I would reccomend is introducing a moisturizer first and finding one that works for you. Then if you still have issues go for a gentler cleanser. The brand you're currently purchasing from has a sensitive rage with a sensitive balance fluid which would be a good start. If you would like to branch out to other brands and want reccomendations just let me know!

Hope that all made sense, and I hope it helps!"

Now I'm not shy about spending on skincare (luckily my job facilitates that), however I'm not frivolous about it.

Like many Asian skincare brands SK II focuses on prevention not correction and has a particular focus. Theirs being a yeast ferment discovered as a by product of sake production. This ferment has countless benefits like antioxidants, vitamins, minerals etc. It gives real results. 

They are also relatively minimalistic, generally with 1-3 active ingredients and the rest stabilizers and preservatives. Nothing wrong with this at all, it actually reduces risk of reaction/ damage.

Unfortunately many j and k beauty brands have similar ingredients in similar proportions at a lower price. And many with a few humectants or other gentle actives in there as well.

All in all if you love the brand or have that disposable income the products are gorgeous. If not or if you want to try something similar first to see if your skin likes it try something like Cosrx or Missha. Particularly if you are looking at essences with fermented yeast.

tl:dr: SK II really does work but realistically you can get very similar products for lower prices. If you have the cash go for that gorgeous bottle if not try something else with fermented yeast."
AskWomen,fhzpfrv,t3_f5jsj2,1582006563.0,"Skincare specialist here! It depends on what your skin type and concerns are. I'll give some general ideas but feel free to comment or message me if you'd like some more in personalised reccomendations!

First of all I'd highly reccomend going to your local Asian market or on amazon for Korean and Japanese skincare. Affordable, and simple but not basic. Particular brands include: Hada Labo, DHC, innisfree, cosrx, biore, lu lu lun.

As far as western brands go: the ordinary, simple, Mario badescu, are good drugstore options.

One thing I would like to stress is everyone's skin is different and products can work for 99% and not for you and vice versa. The most important thing is to give it a fighting chance when you try it. If your current skincare routine is wrong or non-existent your skin may (and probably will) purge. It will look like you're breaking out. However because your skin takes 28 days (approx.) And so it will take that long to see if the product is actually working for your skin. So as sucky as it is stick it out!

Lastly ingredients are everything! This is a learned skill and will take time. However by learning to read ingredients you can determine if a product is good overall and eventually even for your skin personally. Paula's Choice Skincare dictionary is a good place to start, you can also turn to you tube channels like beauty with or skincare by Hyram. 

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions."

For example if you're making spaghetti use a gf sauce and unmarinated meat and cook that as usual. Then prepare the gf pasta first and once thats done do the regular pasta. For cheese buy a separate bag and let everyone know (or write on the bag) that this one is only for your nephew. If you're doing anything in the oven gf goes on top just in case. 

Some common missed things... condiments if you stick your knife in a pot of butter then for example butter your toast then go back into the butter that is now unsafe. Things like cheese where you're sticking your hand in, unless you wash your hands before using it every time have a separate one. Toasters are just a no, you can't clean that enough.
