I have a box here with a 1.4ghz athlon serving to a family of 5. Never misses a beat when decompressing.

Have you checked your memory overhead on the laptop?  I wonder if your issue is actually swapping and consequent hard disk performance on the decompresses, rather than cpu load.

Im assuming you have checked the cpu load on compression tasks and ascertained that its maxed out?"

That was about right for our kids at that age - we all got some downtime and they werent hooked. Its critical to teach them to do other things that they will find rewarding and want to do to fill their time that dont involve technology. Give him stacks of art and craft supplies (and regularly do it with them), give him  a really good range of toys  (dont limit by gender - the more options the better, and \\play with them with him ), give him  musical instruments, lots of stuff he can do in the yard - if you have one; bike, skateboard, skates, trampoline (kids love to bounce). Dancing, music time (dancing is a really fun outlet for little kids), stories; read to him at least an hour every day, ensure he  always has new books coming through the house and encourage him to pick them up in some kind of routine, ie when he wakes up or before going to sleep - model reading behavior yourself by having books and magazines or whatever in your hand at some point regularly. Get him to make furniture forts, put on plays and performances, magic tricks, etc. When you are preparing meals get him in the kitchen helping - often even as young as 4 there are things they can do in the kitchem, and kids love to cook. Do special food prep stuff regularly making novelty cookies or cakes - stacks of fun. Basically any routine you can establish that doesnt rely on a screen will help the kid to learn other ways of entertaining himself and give him skills that dont involve  video games and shows.

 'excutive fionction' is the ability to be able to make decisions about what he wants to do, set goals about the nature of the result he wants, and execute it. This skill is critical for young kids to develop early and probably does not happen when being passively entertained and the only decision thats being made is what to watch next.

If you are still struggling, then consider transitioning him away from 'shows' to more active types of activities on screens insead or in conjunction. There are virtually infinite great educational apps and young kids really love them. If he has to be on a screen more than you would ideally like then things that are 'active' and intellectually stimulating will at least offer the benefits they are capable of. Likewise, there are higher quality shows and shows for kids that are pure entertainment. If you can encourage him to watch - when he is 'watching' - stuff thats designed around various developmental and educational concepts, that might be better than just whatever his favorite junk cartoon is (not makig any assumptions, but kids often dont discriminate, and there are definitely shows that move them forward and others that are simply not concerned about that)"

HomeServer,fcvjutn,t3_ej03j1,1578003638.0,"CPU

1. decide if you are transcoding or not. If you are using playback devices that cant handle mus ltiple formats (for example some tv's) OR you want to watch media outside your home, then transcode. If you plan on watching at home and all your front ends can play multiple formats, AND you dont plan on watching a lot of simultaneous streams no need.
2. Then, if transcoding, you will need a CPU capable of doing that work for as many streams as you want to play simultaneously. If not transcoding then you can buy a relatively  low end machine and it will still serve files till the cows come home but will cost less to buy and will cost less to run (electricity cost is a factor in any always on machine. you would be surprised)
3. A transcoding rig would run something like plex/emby/jellyfin on back and front ends. Back end will crunch the media down into convenient standardised bite sizes for all the front ends. This will also use less network bandwidth which is why it can be handy if away from home. A non transcoding machine is just a file server, with something like Kodi on the front ends. The back end just sends the files and Kodi does all the work. Comparatively speaking, Plex/emby/jellyfin applications themselves are limited in scope vs kodi which has a lot more options in terms of skins/customisations/add-ons. Kodi can also be used as a front end to plex/emby/jellyfin, so theres that.

OS

Virtualisation is popular but not nexessary. If you want to virtualise, its more cpu, more ram than running bare metal. Perceived dvantages are listed  anywhere (google). If you dont care about virtalising, can use lower end hardware. If you have a decent disk imaging/backup regimen then completely doable without. Personally I dont bother with it. yMMV.  A'server os' is not a requirement to do home server. You can use plain old windows, or any linux distro, OSX, even, and believe it or not it will do everything. It is kinda fun though playing with different secialised OS setups if you are into that  (there are lots of choices) and customising them. Point I am making is it doesnt have to be 'special' to work reliably. 

APPS

There's a good list [here](https://www.openflixr.com/). Not suggesting you use this system, but it does list a bunch of the AAA titles and what they do. It also indicates the scope of what a home server can do. basic guts would be radarr - movies, sonarr - tv shows, a torrent client and a NZB client. You can also do music, audiobooks, etc, etc etc."

The problem that happens is that when you have a design or concept that is only very lightly differentiated from other elements on the page (in this case, white bag, white background), some screens will not be capable of displaying the difference. Bear in mind not everyone is looking at your stuff on a reasonable quality display. It will definitely be the case that with this degree of subtlety the bag will be invisible and it will look like the logo is floating in space - which is not a good look. Consider using more contrast between the two so they are differentiated, and be wary of relying on subtle contrast effects except in instances where you have total control (ie a print run you can supervise or a particular known digital display you can vet).

Also I cant see how to get in touch with you. It may well be you have a contact link there somewhere but I looked a couple of times then gave up. If its there and not obvious, thats a problem. Consider that some percentage of your visitors will be annoyed or put off if they cant access  something as basic as this."

Even if you do it and then find you need to upgrade the back end (not saying its inevitable, just 'if') you would still want it cabled just for the reliability and performance benefits."

Food intolerance

Not enough exercise

Poor diet (nutritional deficit/s)

Environmental factors (localised polution, toxins of some kind)

Sleep apnoea (you think you slept but in actual fact you have been waking up without necessarily being aware its happening)

televisionsuggestions,fcsje5w,t3_einnq7,1577917745.0,"Morning Show - steve carrell, jennifer aniston, reece witherspoon. the most expensive first season production cost ever, apparently. Its about sexual misconduct in the workplace, but also very funny in places. Loved it.

Umbrella academy. Watched this after seeing The Boys. Enjoyed its dark elements.

Third Season of The Crown. Amazing series about Queen of england. Historically accurate, compassionate, and probably a relatively honest depiction of a very difficult job. 

Manhunt UNAbomber - had been meaning to get to this for a long time because if its critical reputation. I was not disappointed. Fans of Mindhunter and I am the night,  would love this. I did.

Too Old To Die Young - plays a bit like David Lynch's stuff. Meticulously visual with an 80's score and some really fascinating direction it looks distinctive but also has narrative chops. Fans of gritty crime shows might appreciate. Its unusual.

Mrs Fletcher - smart, funny sex-positive comedy with heart examines matters of sexual connection and troubles aspects of certain masculinities. Feel-good stuff.

The most recent season of Get Shorty, which I have enjoyed a lot. Based on the Travolta film, its about an irish gangster who is passionate about movies, becoming involved with a studio and juggling  obligations to a South American crime cartel with filmmaking. Anyone who loves movies would probably get a kick out of this.

Limetown - Facebook's foray into online streaming entertainment offered this up and its pretty watchable. Feels a bit like a cross between The Sinner and The Leftovers. 30min eps are easy to fit in. Jennifer Beale is good as the protagonist.

Mandalorian - nice to see a faithful tv offshoot from star wars. they really have put a lot of effort into getting the story-world as close as possible to the original 70's, 80's films and it shows. Some stellar talent here including Taika Waititi. Plus, >!baby yoda.!< So....

Mr Inbetween - a little-heard-of Aussie Crime show about a hit man. One of my favorite shows of the year. Its unusual amd sometimes quite funny.

It is possible that running it in a low-overhead os like MX linux (can be done from a usb3 flash drive with no changes to your machine) could yield faster performance. Such distros use lightweight desktops (in this case XFCE) which will leave more ram available to the app."

dont know if it fits here, but I finally found a decent text completion tool for linux ""[autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)"", which is like a minimalistic version of phraseexpress. Saves me a lot of typing and no-bullshit config was quick and easy to set up.

I kept being annoyed by W10s start menu lack of responsiceness to text (like typing 'note' to get the shortcut for notepad, etc). Replaced it with [wox](http://www.wox.one/), which is like a newer entry into the Launchy space.  Much happier. Wox noteably uses Everything's search engine. 

After years of messing about with intermittently working implementations of VNC and RDP on Linux, I have moved across to [Nomachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) for all the machines on my home network. The thing I am appreciating about it is it just installs and works (no messing about with config files, etc) and allows all the machines (\*nix, windows) to talk to each other seamlessly (and reliably).
