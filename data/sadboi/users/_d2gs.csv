askaconservative,fr3v437,t1_fr3trjp,1589867121.0,"That is fair to compare more deaths to less deaths, but there are already laws and lots of things in place to try and prevent the things that cause more deaths from happening. Lots of them. I’m not sure the efficacy of some of them but seatbelt laws have saved a lot of lives and things like that. We can ban guns in public places to prevent gun violence but that’s unbelievably stupid to disarm law abiding citizens from protecting themselves in situations where there could be a shooter who obviously doesn’t care about a gun ban. That’s a problem. I’m not trying to be “flippantly dismissive” by saying murder is different, I am just pointing out that is not unreasonable to ask to look for ways to prevent being possibly being murdered by some person who is off their rocker. Just because something causes more deaths doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take the time to address something that causes other deaths.  If it doesn’t matter how some one dies than does it mean that if you were killed by something that is statistically not probable, your death shouldn’t matter?"

Tobacco, alcohol, opiate deaths are sad, but those people do it to themselves. Auto accidents are a risk we take for the convenience of cars. Death from the flu is also sad, but it doesn't compare to some one intentionally going somewhere to murder people. Murder is completely different."

Unfortunately they were paid out during a time that Denver Health was asking their employees to cut back, which makes it very very inappropriate to give out those bonuses. That’s why pitchforks are raised. And honestly fact that they thought that would be okay to do exemplifies the argument that these jabronies don’t deserve the amount of money they are making.

I don’t consider extreme right wing to really be a part of normal people conservatives because they’re so far on the end of the spectrum. Are you thinking of Antifa protests? 

I do get you on the tolerance and open mindedness but I want to offer you the reason why. It’s really hard to disengage those ideas when they mean other people’s opinions and thoughts. 

I will say it is hard to tolerate people who vote directly against the best interests of society as a whole but that’s where our differences lie—-what is the best interests of society? I believe people are responsible for each other and conservatives believe people are responsible for themselves. I take that to mean conservatives are selfish and don’t want to help others less fortunate than they are due to things that are out of their control, and conservatives believe liberals just want free hand outs and to not work for things, on the belief that everything IS in their control. When really, you just want to pay less taxes and to see where your money is going (literally to the military) and to know it’s not mismanaged, and I just want a social safety net for those that need it and a healthcare system that doesn’t bankrupt and ruin lives more than the illness itself, and I don’t care if it means paying more in taxes.

I hope that made sense but I’d like to see what you think, or how you really see it."

TBI,fohhtpo,t3_g799a9,1587766221.0,"Look for another doctor. I'm serious. If you can reach out and say that you want a second opinion, because you need help for your head injury that is exacerbating your mental health issues. What you are experiencing is from your head injury. Keep repeating that, and keep saying that any mental issues you are having are made worse by your TBI.

I ended up having suicidal ideation a few months after my head injury. I didn't think I could keep living in the fog that I didn't realize at the time was the symptoms from the concussion. The behavioralist psychologist I spoke to missed the connection to my head injury and focused on the stressors in my life at the time, and I wish she had caught it the time because it might have helped me get help earlier.

Please keep advocating for yourself. Don't give up. One of the hardest parts in my opinion about TBI's is that we have to advocate for ourselves some how even though our cognitive functions are affecting everything we do and making everything harder."
