Connecticut,fah5s4j,t1_fagloks,1576079782.0,"Good point. Lets just scrap the whole thing.  The stuff we're getting that we didn't have before, isn't up to this guys standards. Better to have no jobs, than imperfect ones. I'm sure the hundreds of people who will go from no job/income, to some job/income will agree. Hopefully when they cash their checks, the money isn't slightly dirty or torn. They might have to burn it.

You must be a blast at parties."

AmItheAsshole,f0enrc3,t3_d4is2o,1568570947.0,"YTA. So much YTA. Pay attention to your kids. It doesn't matter what was broken, or what the value is, you're responsible for what they do.  Also, you should have said something before you left instead of just leaving. That certainly didn't help. 

And why would someone set a trap ??? How could the homeowner possibly have known kids would be there, and they would be unattended, an they would actually go and mess with the piece of art that your daughter messed with ? 

If necessary, get an appraisal of the item (this should be at YOUR expense). Then explain to your kid that she shouldn't touch other peoples things (she should already know that...so YTA for that too), pay for the item, and next time watch your kid."

answers,excqaps,t3_crzisa,1566156941.0,"We use the metric system plenty, just not as our main system. Pretty much everything has both gallons/liters, mph/kph, inch/cm/mm listed on it. Many fields use metric exclusively here. Others don't. We (sorry to speak for the whole country here) were taught imperial in school, so it stuck with us. Also, the conversions aren't that difficult (especially now that we can just say ""siri, how many \*\*\* in a \*\*\*"").

We're fine with both."
relationship_advice,ex25t03,t1_ex0stq8,1565963305.0,"Forgive me for saying so but I think you're looking at this the wrong way. You were chosen by your parents. So many children are either unwanted, or accidents. Your parents wanted you so much that they were willing/wanting to take you in and love you just the same. I know it means nothing coming from a random internet stranger, but that's how I always see it. I imagine that in actuality, from an outside perspective, you are far more wanted than a good percentage of kids. Just my 0.02."

AskDocs,ewjy751,t3_cojtvr,1565473874.0,"NAD, but i had a similar problem a few years ago, and i was going through a lot of the same things (minus the weed). The doctor put me on a low dose antidepressant (for depression, not the nausea), but a few weeks later my nausea just went away. I remember there was a point a few years later i stopped the antidepressant, and the stomach issues returned. I got back on them, and was better again. No more nausea.

Hope it can be helpful. Good luck."

The school day is only so long and can't possibly be relied upon to show kids every skill they may need. School is there to teach you how to learn, not to actually show you everything that needs to be learned. We might just have to figure some stuff out on our own"

Good luck, and feel free to PM me if you have issues with anything. Im a dad, and my son is just a bit older than you. Whatever you have going on, my son likely went through it recently.
