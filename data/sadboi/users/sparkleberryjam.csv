Also, this is kind of unrelated, but I‚Äôm a dog groomer and we have to sell spa packages with upgrades.  If we try to sell them at $10 we hardly sell any, but people are more than happy to spend $20. I die a little on the inside every time I sell one."

CasualConversation,foi7t2d,t3_g7dyig,1587780514.0,"I grew up in a very touristy coastal town and there was a breakfast and lunch restaurant hidden off the road that only locals knew about about. It was in an old house, and it was just a big open dining room with a counter and an open kitchen. The cook was a very grouchy old man and there were a bunch of regulars who were basically all different versions of the two muppet guys that sit up in the balcony and heckle people. There were no waiters and the whole room was a mess of tables and chairs just randomly thrown everywhere. There was no menu. Everyone would just go in, seat themselves, and yell their order to the cook. He would not acknowledge you and you would have no idea if he heard you or not. Also you pretty much just had to guess what they had for food. After awhile the cook may or may not put your order up on the counter and yell at you that it was ready, and you would go up and get it. I can‚Äôt remember exactly, but I‚Äôm pretty sure everything on the menu was the same price and they only took cash, exact change only. If you didn‚Äôt have exact change you would just have to give whatever you had. The food was not anything special...it was pretty much what an average person would make at home. You also had to clear your own table and clean up. We used to go after church every week and every single week a huge argument would break out between the customers over politics or some random thing and everyone would be drinking coffee and yelling at each other. A few times over the years the restaurant was in danger of shutting down because of money problems and the regular visitors would come up with the money to save it. Also every once in awhile one of the elderly men wouldn‚Äôt show up for breakfast and someone would go check up on them and find them not well or find out they had been in the hospital and again everyone would make sure they were taken care of. Probably about ten years ago the original owner passed away and someone kept the name of the restaurant but moved it to the Main Street and made it trendy and it‚Äôs popular with tourists and soccer moms which is really sad."
