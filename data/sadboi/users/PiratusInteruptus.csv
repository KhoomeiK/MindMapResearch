>The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic

>Lasting more than 12 months

>infected 500 million people – about a third of the world's population at the time.

>The death toll is estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million

>To maintain morale, World War I censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States

>The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much more deadly than the first. 

>In January 1919 a third wave of the Spanish Flu hit Australia, then spread quickly through Europe and the United States

>In spring 1920 a very minor fourth wave occurred

>Even in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that healthcare workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places

>In a 2009 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Karen Starko proposed that aspirin poisoning contributed substantially to the fatalities. She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the post mortem reports still available, and also the timing of the big ""death spike"" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army and the Journal of the American Medical Association both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31 grams of aspirin per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce hyperventilation in 33% of patients, as well as lung edema in 3% of patients.

I appreciate your words tho I don't look at it that way. I honestly don't want disability. I have truly loved working since I was able to push a lawn mower around the neighborhood...and not one of those fancy self propelled ones either. I have always had a passion for being a productive member of society.

Short story: At one point I had to go on unemployment when I first had my accident.The unemployment office gives you a piece of paper to write down all the businesses and contacts where you have put in for a job. 

Well, now days, even 10 years ago everyone was making the switch to online applications. So I would print out all the applications for the month that I was unemployed. I came in on more than one occasion with about an inch thick stack of applications, to which they replied....we can't handle all of this. Just write down 10 or so and hand that in.

I want to work. Save the disability or unemployment for those who really, really need it. But alas, here I am. Again, I am thankful that the accident didn't turn out worse than it could have. I could've just as well ended up paralyzed or dead. 

I don't pity myself, but to quote John Lee Hooker: I'll never get out of these blues alive.

My aneurysm has steadily grown. My insurance would actually have to approve it first, as they do all 'very expensive' procedures. Then there would be out of pocket expenses for me. My insurance wouldn't cover all of it.

For instance, at the beginning of the year, my doctor wanted to do a stress test on my heart. The usual running on a tread mill until you almost collapse. That procedure alone would cost me $1800 out of pocket. That doesn't sound like a lot, but when you think about being on a severely restricted budget, $1800 plus time off of work, plus support, the cost is high. By itself, $1800 would be easier acquired, however it is the residual costs that are the barrier. 

I am home bound because of a brain trauma that happened about 10 years ago. Since then I have had grand mal seizures and some residual mental issues. I do run a home business, but money is scarce. I am thankful to have some money coming in and it does put taters on the table.

I have been turned down for disability twice now for what ever reason. I have one more shot. I'm hoping my lawyer will come through for me as it is now in his hands.

All I know is that they tell me when it gets to the point I am at, they do surgery. I'm under strict orders not to lift anything over 35 lbs because if it were to burst, I would never see the inside of an ER.

That being said, I accomplished my goal of 190 lbs using CICO and light exercise such as walking. I do a 10 mile round trip ever other day now.

The best advice I can give is to start out slowly. If you jump right into a 1200 calorie daily input and 10 mile hike you are going to hurt and you are going to get discouraged then quit. Start slow and work your way up. 

I wish you the very best of success."

Someone else responded with a link for setting up profiles in FF and I will give that a review. 

Thank you so much for your help."

Epilepsy,fqvatxc,t1_fqtrdxe,1589673368.0,I have also touched base with the fine folk over at r/firefox to see if I could tap the brain trust there for a handful of solutions that people could employ whether or not they were tech savvy or not.
firefox,fqvao1e,t1_fqtowgv,1589673272.0,"This information is for others, specifically for those in r/epilepsy. There are some nasty spamming going on involving gifs and animations that are specifically targeting those with epilepsy. I mean, I guess there are some cold hearted assholes in this world unfortunately.(https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/15/malicious-tweets-targeting-epilepsy-charity-trigger-seizures)

I, myself, suffer from seizures tho I employ the ""under the hood"" method to accomplish that. So, I am on a fact finding mission, for my fellow brethren, to gather different techniques to allow people to turn off and on their animations. 

Some people may not be as tech savvy as others so I was looking for the gammet of solutions I could offer, giving those with less tech skill the same final solution as those with some tech savvy.

I do apologize if I was being unclear. 8 hours ago, I apparently didn't have enough caffeine in me."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fqthpul,t1_fqtft8w,1589639224.0,"I get that too. Believe me. But I look at the innocent lives that are collateral damage in this fiasco, and it breaks my heart. 

Yes there are consequences to all of our actions. And reality is a cold hearted bitch that does not discriminate one iota.

It is the same way I view these 'anti-lock down' protestors. If their actions were theirs alone, get sum. The fact of the matter is that they do not act alone. They go back to communities and families who then become collateral damage just because some hillbilly yahoo wants to claim that freedom means I can do whatever the fuck I want to, when I want to, and fuck everyone else. That's not freedom. That's chaos. One only has to look at recent headlines where 100's of protestors are now COVID-19 positive. 

But my heart goes out to those caught up in their frenzy.....the innocent families. Those are the ones that get under my skin."

Epilepsy,fqte2lx,t3_gks49y,1589637093.0,"I'm not sure how/if this would work on a mobile since the only thing I use my mobile for is to make calls and text (Phone use nothing else), but there are extensions to help kill animations in browsers. They are not infallible, but they will help.

Here are two articles that cover most browsers:

https://techlogon.com/how-to-stop-animated-gifs-playing-in-ie-firefox-and-chrome/

https://techlogon.com/firefox-20-will-remove-esc-key-ability-to-stop-animated-gifs-playing/

In my real world testing, the ones for FireFox browsers worked much better. Also there is a guide to adjusting the settings in FireFox itself to turn off animations. Obviously, when you adjust the settings under the hood, as it were, of FireFox, they are permanent until you return the settings to their original point. 

Again, these measures (except changing FF settings) aren't inflatable and will at times let an animation or two slip by. but it's better than nothing. As I was always admonished as a kid, ""A little bit of something is a hell of a lot better than a whole lot of nothing"".

Hope that helps and reduces problems.

ETA: I have queried the FireFox sub here on Reddit to see if there are other means to simplify these procedures or if there are other measures one can take. I will return with any information I can acquire."

Economics,fqrijho,t1_fqrfs80,1589585051.0,"You have a point. Waaaaay back in 'olden days' fast food, grocery baggers, etc were jobs mostly done by high-school kids needing some extra money. Reluctance to increase their minimum wage was explained as these jobs were not meant for life time careers. They were meant for high schoolers and young adults who wanted a little spending money.

Now, if you walk in to just about any fast food joint you will see a lot of adults and even seniors working at these jobs.

The economic climate has changed dramatically. These jobs should now require at minimum, a living wage."
