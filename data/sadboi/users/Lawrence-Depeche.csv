depressed,fm1ebmo,t3_fs8pm6,1585676866.0,Suicidal thoughts are a daily occurrence for me so yes your point is valid and true for many I’m sure x
SuicideWatch,fldivj9,t3_fo5mpc,1585065418.0,"I agree with your view on this. I’ve decided to stop using any kind of helpline because they are quite useless when you’re in a crisis and suicidal. They want you to end the call as soon as possible, it’s like they don’t have time for you which is exactly the opposite of what they make you perceive through their advertising and such."
SuicideWatch,flax7se,t3_fneywx,1584992954.0,"Literally had to put up with my support worker telling me to try and enjoy things while social distancing..... I didn’t reply because he doesn’t understand that when you’re depressed, and when you’ve been suicidal for months, enjoying things is hard."
depressed,fkycwra,t3_fl7ddv,1584646240.0,I hardly eat at all mainly because there’s a lot of family pressure to eat large amounts of food so I try and eat as little as possible. And I feel like I’m being greedy when I eat.
SuicideWatch,fjhiiin,t3_fddfs5,1583348778.0,"I can’t imagine getting to 30 years old let alone 50. I’m going to be 20 in May and I am dreading it, I can’t get over the fact I’ve had to live on this earth for 20 decades."
SuicideWatch,fjh1zc6,t3_fd8tmk,1583339705.0,I’ve felt this way since I was a kid. I don’t want to get old anyways.
SuicideWatch,fiulce4,t3_f9x502,1582743586.0,I feel the same. I’d prefer it if I was never found.
