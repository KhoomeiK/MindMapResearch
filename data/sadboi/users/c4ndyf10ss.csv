It’s better for a child to go through chicken pox, because adult chicken pox can be a lot more deadly. I had chicken pox as an adult and I almost died from it, it was one of my worst experiences of my life.

If you’re in a country where there’s a common vaccine for it, then vaccinate your damn children. But depending on the situation, “pox parties” can be somewhat beneficial. If I can’t get my child vaccinated against it when he’s old enough, I’m going to try my best to have him get it whilst young, I don’t want him to go through that as an adult.

Pre PTSD fire was already my biggest fear, I don’t smoke because I’m too afraid to even hold an unlit lighter or a match. Anything fire related just terrifies me, I truly hope that one day I can start to get over it. I went almost 4 years with no heating on in the winter. 4 years of using no oven, microwave, kettle and toaster.

Not trying to turn this into a pity party but I guess I’m venting to get it off of my chest. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone."

No one is in danger, I have a heat detector alarm which is perfectly functional, and would go off if there happened to be a fire.

I’m going to keep covering the other fire alarm that gets triggered by simply taking a shower, having someone smoke or vape in my apartment which leaves me in constant fear, panic, hallucinations and flashbacks."

I don’t want anything to do with them at all, I wouldn’t be able to test the new one without having a serious mental breakdown. PTSD from the fire controls every single aspect of my life. I can’t do a day without hallucinating smoke/fire and I’m constantly in a state of fear."
AmItheAsshole,ff5nhof,t3_ers6tf,1579601775.0,"NAH, I was seeing a guy who had herpes, I decided not to stay with him, it’s such a difficult situation for everyone involved.

It’s not a super serious health issue and most people actually already have oral herpes, but no one wants genital herpes. I felt so awful for him, it ruined pretty much any chance of a relationship for him, unless he had found someone else who had it.

Even with protection and antiviral meds, it just isn’t worth taking the risk because what if you caught it, and then you broke up with each other? That’s your chances of dating and finding a partner pretty much over.

You’ll never be TA for protecting your own health, but maybe reach out to her and let her know it’s nothing personal, she’s probably feeling very awful and fragile right now."

It’s strange because geese don’t bother me, but ducks make me super uncomfortable. I actively go out of my way to avoid them."

AskReddit,ff2linf,t1_ff26ibu,1579511806.0,"It’s kinda tricky, the reason the fire happened is because the smoke alarm was too sensitive, so everything was fine until it went off.

It made me jump so I spilled hot oil onto the hob which created a massive fire. The steam from my shower also sets the fire alarm off. I decided to completely cover it with a beanie hat so it no longer works - I do have a heat detector though which should work if there’s an actual fire."

But yeah, it fucking sucked because I had to pay with the money I got for my birthday to get him a taxi home, which cost me like £30."

AskReddit,ff0zye6,t3_er2hqa,1579473904.0,"Anyone cooking in the same house as me, fire alarms, loud beeping, the smell of burning or cooking food and even steam.

I have a full PTSD meltdown and I hallucinate smoke and fire - I went 4 years without using an oven, microwave, hob, kettle etc, and I never turned my heating on at all. I’ve only just gotten over the heating situation a few days ago which is a massive step, but I don’t think I’m anywhere near ready to use an oven or cook anything again.

Anything electrical has to be turned off and unplugged if not in use... it has complete control over my life, and I always have to make sure my fire alarm is covered and blocked off so it can never go off."
