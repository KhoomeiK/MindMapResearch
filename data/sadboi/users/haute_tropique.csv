But when they made the 1980s reinterpretation, there were certainly other inspirations for Tony Montana as the character shifted from an Italian American in Chicago to a Cuban American in Miami. A lot of people think Mario Tabraue was one of those inspirations, and as far as I know that was neither confirmed nor denied by anyone involved in the film."

Going to college leaves most students tens of thousands of dollars in debt; hell, I know people with student debt in the 6 figures. I left my previous career to go back to school to become a teacher, and in my ed classes we had to discuss that fact that we might be expected to put our lives on the line in face of a school shooting. Additionally, retirement might be literally impossible for most people in my generation.
