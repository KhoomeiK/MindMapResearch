mau5trap since 2013 has released mostly glitch/bass-heavy house and techno, sometimes with vocals. I agree with the ""house"" label but less with the ""progressive"" qualifier. ""Progressive"" has the idea of dubs and long chords with some trance elements (quoting Discogs)."

I like all of Joel's music from 2005 to 2007 and it's obvious that he experimented heavily with different sounds. The variety of 2005's ""Get Scraped"" to the 2006 tracks on Melleefresh vs. Deadmau5's ""At Play"" to 2007's ""Jaded"" is incredible!
