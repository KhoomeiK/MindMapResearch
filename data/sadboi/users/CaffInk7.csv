For example, perhaps your isp decides it doesn't like some independent news sources, and they opt to to throttle them just a little, for now. In the future, perhaps a lot. Just enough to dissuade you from consuming that news source, without tipping their hand that they're doing it at all.

Any sort of information that is available could quietly be throttled or interfered with, I suspect. News, marketing efforts, influence campaigns. This could be the start of a finer degree of control over the individual's information bubble.

Oil prices are below zero and there is less need for it at the moment, which suggests that some oil producers could be in danger of going under, which further upsets the economic ecosystem.

In the hands of someone who is ruthless or manipulative, it gives that person an advantage in any current or future dealings. In addition to making you vulnerable to any influence campaigns that may ultimately not have the interests of you and yours at heart.

My perspective is that it is the authoritative sources of information in people's bubbles that has the most impact on one's decisions. And if those authoritative sources are telling you that X candidate cannot win no matter how much you may like his policies, but this other candidate is a shoe-in, I believe that has a massive effect upon the election that is not measured by dollars spent.

OverwatchUniversity,fmtvq9z,t3_fxb875,1586379847.0,"I'm no expert player, so my advice is likely useless. I usually tank, and I'm low plat, last time I bothered to play comp.  As a general guideline, I find it best to approach the game with the base principle of: ""How can I help the players on my team make the most of their hero abilities and ultimates?""

Example 1: I'm playing winston, and I have my ultimate ready to go.  My primary damage DPS player is a soldier, who has taken the high-ground.  I see that his ultimate is ready, too.

He hasn't communicated what his intentions are, but the fact that he has taken high ground with his ultimate ready speaks volumes.  I'm going to hold my ult until he uses his, and then I'm going to ult and try to separate the enemy rein from the rest of his team so that my soldier will be able to shoot freely without a rein shield getting in the way.  I'd do the same against an ana, trying to put my fat body in the way of any sleep darts that may be getting aimed at my ulting soldier.

Example 2: I'm playing orisa.  I'll be frequently trying to pull squishies away from cover and from behind shields into a predictable location for my dps to get in some easy headshots.  This can be tricky if you're pulling squishies out from behind a rein without also pulling the rein, but that's a matter of practice.

If I see that my hanzo has his ult ready, I'll try to save my pull ability until he uses it, to help secure kills against the cowards that flee the dragon.

\_\_

Aside from the above, if I'm playing main tank, I try to be aggressive and put myself in the way of the enemy team as much as possible so that my teammates can fire freely without taking too much damage.

If I'm playing off-tank, I try to keep an eye on the backline if the enemy team has flankers (tracer, sombra, reaper, doomfist, etc).  If the other team isn't making attacks against my backline, I mostly back my main tank's plays.  If he pushes, I'm watching his back and trying to stop him from getting his face stomped in if he miscalculates."

It would get weakened and sabotaged, and the private insurance companies would price out all the of the expensive undesirables so that they burden the public plan without the all-in tax burden to alleviate the cost.

I think we'd see higher taxes without the savings on premiums, copays and deductibles to show for it.

IMO, the private insurance companies really don't bring anything to the table aside from gatekeeping tiers of access so that people with more money get superior care. I don't really see a need for them, personally.  

Aside from that, their presence as middlemen between us and our healthcare means we pay more for it, and while I don't work in the healthcare industry, it sounds like the administrative stuff dealing with the private insurance industry is shitty.

In contrast, m4a means we are all in the same boat.  It sounds like the most cost-efficient way to do handle the payment aspect of healthcare.

And those times when I ended up hitting the bottom in my bank account and got hit with overdraft fees. That could snowball quite quickly.  Man, those were dark times.

There was a period when I worked two full-time jobs and snatching a few hours of sleep between shifts. Popping those now illegal stay-awake pills to get me through.

Life ain't easy when you're on the bottom. Hell, if I had gotten injured or sick so that I would be unable to work, I would have been well and truly screwed.

In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought by Phibro Corporation, and Bloomberg was laid off from the investment bank with a $10 million cash buyout of his partnership stake in the firm.

The company sold customized computer terminals that delivered real-time market data, financial calculations and other analytics to Wall Street firms. The terminal, first called the Market Master terminal, was released to market in December 1982.

Which is nice for him.  He found an incredibly profitable niche for himself and shot to near the top of the pile in terms of wealth.

But there seems to have been a trend of the people at the top earning ever fatter shares of generated wealth.

>In the United States, for example, “trickle down” economic policies that support tax cuts for the rich with the aim of boosting economic growth and jobs have led to a $2 trillion annual redistribution of wealth from the bottom 99 percent of earners to the top 1 percent over the last 30 years, said Nick Hanauer, a former venture capitalist and now head of Civic Ventures, which aims to drive social change.

That quote is citing Nick Hanauer, who is a co-founder of a progressive think tank, so he's certainly a biased person.  But I'm not certain he's wrong.

There are plenty of other articles that cite other people that have worked or currently work in economics or the financial sector that are concerned about the wealth inequality growth.  How wealth inequality is good to a point, but causes harm past some inarticulated level.

I don't have any background in economics, or finance, or anything of the sort....but I think I can see some of this problem, too.  The big ticket stuff that we generally need to achieve some reasonable level of satisfaction in our lives seems to have gotten stupidly expensive relative to our earnings.  Healthcare, housing, and education.  Transportation costs kinda suck, too.

And at the same time it looks to me like the wealthy have far too much influence over how shit gets run in this country.  I get it....in theory, they're the best of us and know how things should be done.  I don't know if that's true, though.  Certainly not across the board.  I think its more like, they live in their world, and we live in ours, and they don't really know what its like for us.  But they have an outsized influence on both worlds.  And we just gotta live in it as best we can.

All this to say, I don't think its as simple as, ""he earned all of that, and its  un-american to try to stifle his earnings or influence"".  I think at some point we gotta make some adjustments before we find ourselves living in some sort of feudal society based around mega-rich owning all the businesses and governmental leaders and we dumbfucks on the bottom have to cradle their balls to earn their favor so that we get to have a taste of the good life."

When it comes to politicians, I don't have much faith in them.  One of the few that I've seen that I think is legitimately sincere and uncorrupted is Bernie, and he believes we can make it work.  I trust that he has the counsel of knowledgeable people, and that he's done the legwork on this.  

And even if it doesn't turn out as rosy as I think it could, I think we'd adapt it or adapt to it.

For example, this one: ""medicare4all would result in long wait times"", without recognizing that many challenges can be overcome.  That particular one wouldn't even take much effort, IMO...subsidize medical education and invest in healthcare AI systems.

And this issue of cost....some say it would cost too much.  My understanding is that we have essentially three groups of people when it comes to healthcare: those poor enough to qualify for medicaid, those old enough to qualify for medicare, and everyone else who either has to find a way to get health insurance so that they can cap their losses to the tens of thousands, or go uninsured and have no cap at all.  In either scenario, you can experience financial distress or bankruptcy in the event that you get unlucky.  And between premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, plenty of us avoid making use of basic healthcare services and stretch medications because who's got money to burn like that?

Healthcare is one of those things that everyone is going to need at some point in their lives....for the unfortunate, multiple times in their lives.  It makes sense to me that we'd cut out the private insurance middleman and just pay into a common pool.  Anyhow, I don't want to get off on more of a rant than I already have.

And that your conclusion is that should Bernie be the nominee, it will not only ensure Trump's victory in 2020, but also cause problems with the other Democrats who advocate for far less ambitious changes and will have trouble getting elected because Bernie's plan will become the defacto standard for the progressive vote--politicians advocating plans that fall short of that would encounter problems getting elected.

\_\_\_\_

If I understood you correctly, then I'd be interested in seeing your sources for why you think people are largely against the idea of Medicare For All.

I recall seeing a story citing a poll where 70% of respondents were favorable to the idea.  Although I'll admit that polls are like statistics in that they can be manipulated to represent distortions of the truth.

Still, 70% is a pretty strong number...enough to make me think there's sufficient support to see Bernie win the election.  And if that's the case, I don't see why having more progressive candidates who believe in universal healthcare wouldn't take up the slack of their less-progressive democratic  rivals.  If Congressman Joe Shmoe doesn't have sufficiently progressive views, wouldn't a more progressive challenger arise to take his seat?

I recall a big thing being made about Ilhan Omar's tweet as being anti-semitic when she was complaining about AIPAC money influencing US decision-making.

I wonder if its due to our respective information bubbles. It seems very difficult to get accurate information about anything political. Anyone who has the ability to gather real data also seems inclined to pursue their agenda and apply spin or selectively release.

Between the media at large doing that habitually and our politicians engaging in partisan theater, it seems like an impossible task to truly get an accurate view because our information sources are all pursuing their own manipulative schemes in an effort to sway the swayable."
OurPresident,fir85fx,t1_fiqxzi2,1582659275.0,"The benefit of the m4a plan, as I understand it, is that everything is free at the point of service.

Currently, the poor get Medicaid and the elderly get Medicare. The rest of us have to pay for insurance to cap our potential debt in the event of a problem to the thousands or tens of thousands, depending on how lengthy treatment is.  Even in an insured scenario, this can be a serious problem that strongly impacts your finances.

And there are plenty of insured people who stretch medications and avoid making use of healthcare services due to the co-pays and deductibles even during non-health-emergency years.

I think that many people are starting to view the middleman insurance companies as unnecessary, inflating costs while offering little value aside from gatekeeping.

It makes sense to me, that we would all simply pay into a universal healthcare system and make use of it as needed, without the potential financial implications for the unlucky.

And that's the value, I think, for many: free at the point of service, no lapses in coverage even if you switch jobs, no risk for unexpected financial burdens if something shitty happens."
politics,fip2yu5,t1_fio33zs,1582596871.0,"Thanks for posting that. Summarizing, these are Sally Pipes' highlights of the UK NHS:

*  Junior doctors earn less than half what subway operators earn and are nearly 17% below the nation's average income.
*  Junior doctors work 100 hour weeks
* Patients receive subpar care and have long waits
* British doctors are paid poorly, have high stress, work long hours, and have low morale. She states they earn on average £90K pounds, which translates to approximately $125K
* 68 emergency-room physicians have presumably warned the government that it is common to treat patients in hospital corridors and that some are dying prematurely

It sounds bad, if her perspective is accurate.  I cannot accept any of her statements as fact, however, without checking them out for myself.  I looked her up...she sounds like a pretty biased source.  A libertarian/conservative that was mentioned in an NY Times article as one of several groups that were defending Wal-Mart without disclosing that they were donation recipients of the Walton Family Foundation. 

Not saying she is wrong, necessarily...just that I'm cautious when it comes to accepting information at face value from people with an agenda.  Her claim that junior doctors work 100 hours weeks may be an exaggeration, for example -- according to an article I've read thus far, the high end is 90 and the NHS set regulations requiring no more than 70-ish back in 2000, so I'm not confident that her facts are going to be accurate.

Anyhow, I'll read more in order to educate myself and try to see how applicable it might be to a US healthcare system, but wanted to let you know that your source citation is appreciated."

politics,filoph0,t1_filmqn2,1582506631.0,"I don't know when he stopped using the millionaire label in his talking points and you haven't sourced it, so I do not know that it was when he became one.  But even if it were so, I don't think it matters.

Your question is: why did he stop attacking millionaires in 2016 \[unsourced claim\], which is roughly the time he became one, yes?

I think the answer is: it was never about the number, it was about the behavior.  You're stating that he is no longer using the millionaire label because he technically has more than a million dollars, and he wants to avoid the hypocrite label.

Sure, I could see it.  But I think context is important.  The man is in politics, and one must avoid giving out free ammunition to your political enemies.  And as I've expressed above, I believe that his complaint isn't about a number.  Its about power and behavior.

Also, consider this: we have a billionaire president.  And, we have billionaires running for the nomination. The label, ""billionaire"" is very relevant these days.  I'd wager that if we didn't have billionaires in politics, the label, ""billionaire"" might not see much use.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: Actually, you did source your claim about when he stopped attacking millionaires and focused instead on billionaires.  In the article you cited, they state that he only attacked millionaires 5 times in 2019.  So, its cut down by half, it seems.  I still maintain that it doesn't matter, because the focus is on the billionaires because billionaires are his political opponents.

**Excerpt:**

Sanders has targeted billionaires as often as ever in the eight 2020 Democratic debates that began in June. But he has not said “millionaires” during the events, according to transcript searches.

It’s not just on the debate stage. Sanders’ campaign Twitter account last tweeted about millionaires on July 31. **It used the word five times in 2019, down from 10 times in 2015**, the year before the last presidential election.

Sanders’ separate Senate Twitter account has tweeted about millionaires twice this year. He has also not stopped railing against the “1%” — the top tier of U.S. earners that includes all millionaires."
politics,filk5z3,t1_filejwa,1582503480.0,"I think his complaint has always been about the super-rich: (a) not paying their fair share, and (b) having undue influence on our government.  Not that their wealth is greater than or equal to 1 million dollars and that's just not fair to the poor.

Its only relatively recently that the term billionaire seems to have entered national discourse.  To me, it seems natural that if you're attempting to address inequality in a public forum, you'd address it from the very top, down, using the labels that are current in the national discourse."
politics,fijiymp,t1_fiiz77m,1582450160.0,"It sounds like we have different understandings of his view on wealth. 

My understanding is that he has no problem with wealth accrual, but that there should be some limits to just how unequal wealth distribution should be.  That, once wealth inequality passes a general threshold, it stifles opportunity for the average citizen.

I don't think his being a millionaire is any sort of betrayal of his principles. His mantra, as I know it, is that everyone pays their share.  Many of the super wealthy seem to have made a sport of dodging their responsibility to the country that provided them the opportunity to prosper.

And things seem to be worsening for many as the years pass. I've seen articles citing the general decline of infrastructure, opportunity...the rising costs of housing, education, and healthcare.....and stagnant wage growth.  At the same time that a greater proportion of the wealth that is generated is going to a small group of people.

These are the things that Bernie is interested in addressing, as I understand it."

Honestly, I think you're right....a better healthcare system might not materialize right away because I think there may need to be examples made of recalcitrant congressmen and senators, first. They'll need to be taught that to stand in the way of single payer is to never hold office.

A Bernie presidency might be just the fight initiator. We may need a second or even third progressive presidential term to get it through.  Those status quo types can be stubborn."

I'm hoping he gets the nomination, wins the election, and then goes on to rouse public support to the levels required to make the change. A difficult task, to be sure. But with enough support from the public, I think it could happen.

But he's not doing anyone any favors with his lifestyle and stated purpose. It's like he's trying to make life harder for everyone, including other hard-knock-life people that may benefit from the laws that let him go back on the street so easily while awaiting his court dates for the other crimes he is currently on the hook for.

But without further information, I couldn't really hazard any other conclusions. I'm assuming he's an extreme outlier.

politics,fi1htbb,t1_fi123yx,1582058037.0,"In the first article, it states she may have violated the Logan Act by meeting with Assad. Her office stated they had approval from the house ethics committee.  A member of that committee said he hadn't heard of such a request.  However, this article is three years old and no official action appears to have been taken with regards to her meeting, so I'm inclined to believe there is more to this entire thing than we are being made aware of.  I cannot take a stance on this without more information. Why was there no official action on this? What don't I know?

In the second article, she had negative views on LGBT and has since publicly changed her mind. If you make a better decision when presented with new information, I'm for that. The woman had an unusual upbringing after all, and it's not surprising she had odd, out-of-step views when she was younger.  She has presumably evolved over time, as people do.


In the third article, she is being attacked for voting present on Trump's impeachment. This entire impeachment thing was only going to have one outcome from the get-go, and seems like just opportunity for politicians of both parties to get in their sound bites to satisfy their supporters.

In other words, I think it was largely political theater to impress constituents and make us believe that our government law makers are doing important stuff.  So, I don't think it is relevant what Tulsi did here. It was all ultimately meaningless.

And finally, in your fourth article, it addresses how often 2020 democratic candidates are mentioned in Russian media. Why is this relevant? I don't think we should permit Russia's media's opinions to sway our voting.

I want some real discussion about this, not bullshit partisan showmanship.  If you think her solution is bad, say so, with clear, substantive reasons why.  This shit is important.

What the hell do we elect these people for?  They take office and seem to spend much of their time creating political theater to make their supporters happy and otherwise catering to the interests of themselves and their donors.

IMO, senators and congressmen should be putting in real work at understanding issues and navigating a path forward.  To me, it looks like many fall short of that.  Incompetence, corruption, blind partisanship.  I'd like to see us kick out the dead weight and elect better people in their place."
