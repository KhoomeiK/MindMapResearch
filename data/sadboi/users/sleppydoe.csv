BPD,fqif5nw,t3_gj1nob,1589395181.0,"I feel like, at least for me, I’m seeking the comfort of “home.” It’s not the actual place, it’s what it symbolizes. God knows we didn’t really get that or we wouldn’t be the way we are. That’s why it’s so hard to “go home” because it sometimes feel like there really isn’t one for us. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve told my fp “I want to go home but there’s no home for me to go to.”"

relationship_advice,fpeb306,t1_fpeafeg,1588543965.0,"Of course. And on a side note, when it comes to medications, it’s really helpful to have someone close monitor it’s effects. We all live in our own realities, what goes on in my head is my reality. Drugs change what goes on in my head, so my reality can be muddied & I may not see things clearly. My partner has really helped with providing feedback on which medications seem to help me & which ones hurt. 

Best of luck to you. I’m sure that whichever path you choose, it’ll be for the best."
relationship_advice,fpea4qg,t1_fpe8m5v,1588543412.0,"I used to be the same way. A big part of depression is feeling like you don’t deserve to be loved, but of course absolutely needing it. Guilt is also a big factor. I’d always feel so shitty about putting my partner through it. He probably thinks that by pushing you away he’s saving you in the long run. Luckily my partner is extremely patient & stuck by me. Now I’m finally on track to fixing my mental health. It just takes time. 

And if this genuinely becomes too much for you to handle, that’s perfectly okay. Above all else, you have to put your well-being first. I don’t know your relationship, every one works differently. All I can say is you’re a great person for wanting to help your boyfriend through his depression. I wish I had advice about the distance; thankfully I live with mine, but anything is truly better than nothing."
relationship_advice,fpe8ao5,t3_gcytet,1588542353.0,"The best thing you can do is just offer comfort & an open line of communication. I have pretty severe depression & anxiety, my partner not so much. An important question we always ask each other is, “What do you need from me?” For me, it’s literally just hold me & tell me everything’s gonna be okay."

My point earlier still comes in here, you already have a hard time figuring out what’s real & what isn’t. Instead of being honest & guiding you through it, he’s spinning you even more. I mean hell, you started to write shit down to keep it straight & he still rips on you for it. It almost seems malicious. I’m sure he’s a good person, & you are too, but maybe you two need space. Partners are supposed to help each other be better, but that’s not what’s going on here."

BPD,fla19ee,t3_fnkj7o,1584974385.0,"I think that you’re much better off without him. It seems that being around him made you worse, no one is ever worth more than your stability. What you tell people is really up to you. By not making a smear campaign it shows that you’re handling the situation like an adult. Besides, whoever is blindly believing your ex doesn’t actually know you; therefore, they don’t care about you & you shouldn’t care about them. The people who truly love you aren’t going to purposely use your disorder against you. I don’t know how old your son is so I’m not sure what would be within his understanding. Maybe gently tell him that because of quarantine you two decided to stay away from each other to keep safe? Proceed by building yourself back up again, your value is not determined by anyone but you. You & your son be safe, hopefully this shit will be over soon."

Honestly, my best advice is to just suck it up & cut all ties. Out of sight, out of mind is what fixed the problem for me. You may still think of him occasionally but you won’t constantly have his image in your face tempting you."
