JusticeServed,fqi8c4j,t1_fqi8apx,1589392250.0,"Sorry if my reply was a bit ""messy"" haha, typed on the bus in a hurry:)"
JusticeServed,fqi8apx,t1_fqha015,1589392230.0,"Well, that dosent qualify at all in this discussion. These so called ""firearms"" you refer to are locked up hunting rifles that you can only buy a certain amount of ammunition to, as well as you have to get a license from your local police department to be able to legally have one locked up, which you can only use during hunting season. There is no handguns, automatic rifles (isnt even sold here), etc. That stat just shows that literally every Norwegian has a hunting rifle (like myself), that we dont use. The homicides in the US is not committed with hunting rifles. They are committed with handguns and semi- and automatic weapons. 

Again, I stand my ground: Every well developed western (and Asian) country in the world have strict gun laws. Why cant the US?"
JusticeServed,fqh9ao6,t1_fqh7ksg,1589371651.0,"Well, it probably do, but the murder rate is 100% lower than in the US. Obviously there will be differences between European countries (e.g Norway and Sweden). 

But even if we take the European country with the highest murder rate (Lithuania, 4.50 per 100 000), it‚Äôs still much lower than the US alone (5.50 per 100 000). And in all of Europe it‚Äôs 3.0 per 100 000. 

And if we look at America as a whole (Not just the US) where basically no country have any working gun laws, they have a murder total of 157 000(!), which is 37% of the total murder rate IN THE WORLD. 

America: No gun laws. Counts for 36% of the entire fucking worlds murder rate. 

Europe: Basically no guns. Counts for less than 5% of the woulds murder rate. 

ALSO: The US have had 517 school shootings since 1840, that‚Äôs almost 3 school shootings a year. March 2020 was the first MONTH since 2002(!) without a school shooting in the US.
You want to know how many school shootings there has been in Europe since 1840? 12. 

School shootings in the US in 2019 ALONE: 45.
School shootings in the EU since 1840(!): 12.

How can you possible argue that guns doesn‚Äôt equal murders????"
JusticeServed,fqh22kf,t1_fqgpj4t,1589365148.0,"No problem. I‚Äôm from Norway. 

Well yeah? Every single country with strict gun laws have the lowest murder rates. We can‚Äôt base arguments on what we believe would happen. A lot, (and I mean A LOT) countries have gun laws that basically only allows police to have guns. And they have less crime, less murders, etc. 

Europe: No guns = no murders, extremely low crime rate.

America = everyone should have guns = highest murder rates in the world and high crime rates.

In this case I would say I he causation is pretty clear."

SuicideWatch,fnm9jqf,t1_fnjkp1g,1587067452.0,"Sorry for the late reply bud! Things are hectic during this whole COVID-19 isolation haha.

But I absolutely get where you are coming from. But maybe think about this: If someone would date you, wouldn‚Äôt you think you would try to appreciate that as much as you could instead of putting it on them that they made a bad decision? If that make sense? I do believe that if you had a romantic partner your self perception would change which should also change what you think about that persons decision making. 

Okay I understand. But 35k a year really isn‚Äôt too bad though. Hell im 25k in student debt and 3 years away from a degree haha! But anyways, even though you might see it as ‚Äúnot too much‚Äù it‚Äôs still a yearly income. It‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs economic stability. And when it comes to your living situation: I understand living with your parents probably aren‚Äôt ideal when considering making romantic relationships. But since you haven‚Äôt really said anything bad about them I assume they are okay? And when you move out, have you thought about where and how? As in alone/with friends/apartment/house etc? And the coping mechanism is totally understandable friend. 

No worries! I like chatting with you. I saw that you‚Äôve already seen a few psychologists/psychiatrists from earlier posts, and if they didn‚Äôt tell you that your a great self-describer I will! And on that note, do you see a therapist regularly now?

Also: Would you be able to save up a fair amount of money? And can I ask what degree you have and where you went for Uni?:)

And most important: Have you ever considered doing like a ‚Äúlife-changing‚Äù action? Like saving up as much money as you can and move to Asia? It might sound weird but my uncle did something similar. Here‚Äôs how he changed his life if you want to read the story: He moved to California from Norway when he was about 20. After years of hard work he eventually made it big with a buddy in the commercial business. Like house in the hills, Benz in the garage type big. After a few more years, he had done way to much cocaine, been partying way too much, his wife left him and basically took every penny he had, and he hit rock bottom. He had no clue what to do, so he worked for a year doing some of the same stuff and saved what he could. Then, he moved to Phuket, Thailand, and rented a small beach house. Besides that there was no plan. His philosophy was that: If I can‚Äôt go any lower anyways, why not try the unthinkable? I mean everyone says these things but none actually completes the action of doing it. But he did, and he said he would just take things as they‚Äôd come when he got there. And it worked out really well. He ended up starting a small beach restaurant type thing with no prior knowledge. He just met two chefs I think and they did so together - and now he lives what he says is a perfect life. 

Have you ever thought about something like this? Just by a one-way ticket to some cheap Asian country with a rented apartment/house ready when you get there? And then just taking it from there? I mean what do you really risk?

Sorry for the long reply and I hope there isn‚Äôt too many errors haha:)"

SuicideWatch,fniv6bl,t1_fnh8gls,1586986925.0,"Thanks for the reply friend. You‚Äôre a great writer, I almost feel like I know you now based on the picture on your profile and this really good personality and situation description!

The first thing that catches my attention reading this is how well you are able to describe yourself in such a honest and explainable manner. Its very interesting to see that you are both super aware of your problems, AND why they have become and still are problems. This is a trait very, very few people in your situation has. 

The other thing is this: I can almost assure you that you have negative attentional bias in your self view. I‚Äôm sure a lot of what you said about yourself is true (in your view at least), but I would guess that‚Äôs not how the reality really view you. I‚Äôm not saying that your not telling truth here don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm just saying maybe it‚Äôs not as bad as you think. 

And when it comes to appearance, I‚Äôm not gonna bullshit you and be all like ‚Äúpsychical appearance‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter and so on. It does, but only to a certain extent, and it‚Äôs faaaar from what women look for the most. The clinical literature on romantic relationships shows that financial stability, height and being generally grown up in your behavior is way more important to women when looking for a partner. 

But to get to the core of the problem(s). I guess we can agree that the problem revolves around a missing partner, and maybe especially a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù partner. Basing that on the fact that it seems like your other ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù problems like lack of confidence, not being interesting, humor, etc, only shows them self in the reflection of a missing partner? I have a little trouble articulating my thoughts here. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that it seems that your ‚Äúother‚Äù issues are a result/constructed by the lack a romantic partner. For example if you did have a romantic partner would you still say you were an uninteresting person? I‚Äôm only saying this so maybe we could figure out if it‚Äôs just your perception, and not reality - if the negative perception you have of yourself is rooted in your lack of affection, love and romance. And there is nothing wrong with that - lack of affection takes its toll on the brain which results in a lot of negative thoughts. 
I find you as a person really interesting btw, and I would love to talk more!

Btw do you mind me asking how your finical and living situation look like?

SuicideWatch,fngn3qt,t1_fnfa2hs,1586937718.0,"Hello! That‚Äôs a really good question my friend, and I think I can picture your situation. And to answer your question first, it‚Äôs absolutely fixable. During clinical practice we learn that this is often one of the most common reasons for people to see a psychologist here in Norway. Where you find life meaningless with no goal/direction/ etc - you can‚Äôt seem to find anything that would make it ‚Äúworth‚Äù living. This was kind of my situation too during military service I guess. 

There is obviously no quick fix, but the fact that you can see your own situation from a third person in a sort of ‚Äúfunny‚Äù way (ref. your post in r/Roastme;), is a very good sign. Most can‚Äôt. You can. But as you say, the lack of a goal is the main problem here. A lack of goal, results in lack of motivation, which results in stagnation(?), and your stuck at the same spot in life - and the though of having to be there, in this spot with no enjoyment what so ever is enough to make anyone reconsider if it‚Äôs worth living. 

So we need a goal I think, and maybe a change in perception. My friend, 28 is still super young. I‚Äôm 24 so we‚Äôre not that much apart:D If you could change your perception to something of: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only 28, so I have every possibility to find something to strive after‚Äù, I think I‚Äôve come far:) 

Would you maybe say that a romantic relationship is something that would be a reasonable goal? Or to find a partner to travel with maybe?:)

For example: During the ‚Äútry-outs‚Äù for the special forces I fucked my knee up, and was transferred to another branch(?) (it was during our obligatory service at 18 called ¬´f√∏rstegangstjeneste¬ª). During the boot camp I was using crouches, and we had this pointless task of running in and out of our rooms getting different stuff. The point was that we had to get the right shit super quick. Since I‚Äôd all ready done this during the try outs I was finished way before the rest like five times. To punish the others for being slower than a guy on crouches, I had to do push ups on on leg while they watched. The logic is: ‚ÄúBecause of your lack of skill, your fellow man has to suffer‚Äù. I guess it‚Äôs to show that if you make a mistake, or if you aren‚Äôt on top of your game in battle, your fellow solider will suffer for your mistake.
