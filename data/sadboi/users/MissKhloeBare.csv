BlackGirlDiaries,fogk7lp,t3_g7cdoy,1587753612.0,"I lived in Australia (Melbourne) for several years and had quite a few racist incidents. I felt like they were so behind on some things. Like America is bad but I felt like Australians acted as if there was no such thing as racism. I also lived up north for a spell and the way the natives were treated was disgusting. There was a great community of black women though. Because there weren‚Äôt a lot of us, we really banded together. That honestly made it a better experience than it probably would have been. My time there made me completely stop dating white men and women though. 

I also lived in Vietnam. Once you get past folks treating you like you‚Äôre famous lol, it‚Äôs not that bad. My friend couldn‚Äôt get past it though so it‚Äôs different for everyone. I did have an issue where a school would not hire me because my looks and hair might ‚Äúconfuse the children‚Äù but it turned out alright and I found another place that loved me! 

One of my best friends (she is mixed Norwegian and Ethiopian) is from Sweden. I spent 6 months with her there after we left Vietnam. She felt that it was extremely racist but I didn‚Äôt have the same experience there. It was one of my favourite places to stay. It could have been different if I stayed longer though. I also could have been missing the context in some things. 

I honestly think there is racism everywhere but some places will work better for different people. While I had racist experiences, some people might be having the time of their lives. I guess it just depends on how much you feel the pros outweigh the cons."

It didn‚Äôt look as light blond either...almost like a honey or caramel colour. She was swimming in it and everything. Looked like human hair. So I believe that. I thought her hair looked fine at the wedding and honeymoon so I believe it was different. I think she went home, took the weave out, and then put on her synthetic wig."

https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-health-department-addresses-confusion-over-its-number-coronavirus-test-kits#stream/0


And an excerpt:

What remained unclear was whether those five kits were enough to test five people or thousands of people.

Seeking to confirm the city's capacity for testing, KCUR asked Archer whether one kit tests one person. ""Yes,"" he said.


This appeared to contradict information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says each kit can test approximately 700 to 800 specimens.

In response to a follow-up email requesting clarification, health department public information officer Michelle Pekarsky wrote in an e-mail: ‚Äúone kit, one person.‚Äù

CPTSD,fizh2vr,t3_fabhny,1582862646.0,"I haven‚Äôt done this as much in recent years but from middle school through my early/mid twenties, I pretty much lived in my daydreams. I had built an ENTIRE other life in my head. An entire family of people and stories/situations. Romantic relationships. I‚Äôm embarrassed about it now and haven‚Äôt even shared with my therapist. 

Sadly, what broke it was the realisation that my life now is so terrible that I can‚Äôt even fantasise about anything good. That and my dissociation from my current body and appearance. I‚Äôve thought about it a few times months but can‚Äôt get into the daydream at all anymore."

suggestmeabook,fizdgws,t1_fiymoso,1582860063.0,This is what I did and now I‚Äôm addicted. I do audiobooks at work most of the day and on walk with my dog. I do read some physical books but audiobooks are easier and bring it to life.
Fantasy,fiwj6a8,t1_fiuyvpu,1582788102.0,I‚Äôm excited for the new book as well. I struggled through the first Hundred Thousand Kingdoms book but I ended up enjoying it. Broken Earth is one of my favourite series ever. I want to read Dreamblood soon.
