BlackGirlDiaries,fogk7lp,t3_g7cdoy,1587753612.0,"I lived in Australia (Melbourne) for several years and had quite a few racist incidents. I felt like they were so behind on some things. Like America is bad but I felt like Australians acted as if there was no such thing as racism. I also lived up north for a spell and the way the natives were treated was disgusting. There was a great community of black women though. Because there weren’t a lot of us, we really banded together. That honestly made it a better experience than it probably would have been. My time there made me completely stop dating white men and women though. 

I also lived in Vietnam. Once you get past folks treating you like you’re famous lol, it’s not that bad. My friend couldn’t get past it though so it’s different for everyone. I did have an issue where a school would not hire me because my looks and hair might “confuse the children” but it turned out alright and I found another place that loved me! 

One of my best friends (she is mixed Norwegian and Ethiopian) is from Sweden. I spent 6 months with her there after we left Vietnam. She felt that it was extremely racist but I didn’t have the same experience there. It was one of my favourite places to stay. It could have been different if I stayed longer though. I also could have been missing the context in some things. 

I honestly think there is racism everywhere but some places will work better for different people. While I had racist experiences, some people might be having the time of their lives. I guess it just depends on how much you feel the pros outweigh the cons."

I thought her hair looked fine at the wedding and honeymoon so I believe it was different. I think she went home, took the weave out, and then put on her synthetic wig."

The five test kits has been reported widely in Kansas City. Here’s the article. It says that the Missouri Health Dept had capacity to test around 7-800 but they also say they had 5 kits and each kit was one kit per person.

https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-health-department-addresses-confusion-over-its-number-coronavirus-test-kits#stream/0


And an excerpt:

What remained unclear was whether those five kits were enough to test five people or thousands of people.

Seeking to confirm the city's capacity for testing, KCUR asked Archer whether one kit tests one person. ""Yes,"" he said.


This appeared to contradict information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says each kit can test approximately 700 to 800 specimens.

In response to a follow-up email requesting clarification, health department public information officer Michelle Pekarsky wrote in an e-mail: “one kit, one person.”

suggestmeabook,fizdgws,t1_fiymoso,1582860063.0,This is what I did and now I’m addicted. I do audiobooks at work most of the day and on walk with my dog. I do read some physical books but audiobooks are easier and bring it to life.
Fantasy,fiwj6a8,t1_fiuyvpu,1582788102.0,I’m excited for the new book as well. I struggled through the first Hundred Thousand Kingdoms book but I ended up enjoying it. Broken Earth is one of my favourite series ever. I want to read Dreamblood soon.
