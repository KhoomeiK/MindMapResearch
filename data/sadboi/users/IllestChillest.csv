You have to talk to your wife with a secular therapist or something to de-escalate her indoctrination. Cults can get dangerous really quickly because their adherents don't act rationally. They'd probably lose in court if you did something about them, because they don't have a designated place of worship and thus wouldn't qualify as a religion. Look into that, because it might be a legal argument. 

Most if not all of all religion is a legal scam. Once someone has authority over another persons beliefs they can control them. The cult could tell your wife to do literally anything and she'd do it. Think of that for a second, someone running a scam cult is in control of your wife, and now they want your child to join her. And, they're tearing your marriage apart. You've got to find out who this guy is, and what this guy is doing, fast."

Left behind was a book written by a guy who thought the world was going to end in 2011. The rapture has the same scriptural authority as the book of Mormon and is believed in by countless protestants to this day. It's caused major issues in human discourse. The Bible though, takes the cake in the suppression of science and minorities through murder, slavery, and persecution of non-Christians. It is by far the greatest false propaganda force that's ever existed, and has warped countless minds around it's theology to the point of schizophrenic ideology. The amount of people that the scientist's, whose discipline is biology will cure of major diseases and bodily malfunctions, will be much greater than the Christians who pray for miracles and punch the sick on TV to pretend cure diseases. Blindness has already been demonstrated to be curable with gene therapy, as well as cancer and sickle cell disease. It's just a matter of how fast the biologists can map the genome and edit dna appropriately. The coming leap in understanding of human diseases from SCIENCE, will be garunteed to cure countless people of their diseases, much more than God ever did miraculously.
