Well, these all are known facts. But what still remains scarily unknown is the level of pollution in our indoor air.

What is even more shocking is that of all the deaths that can be attributed to the drug overdose, **40% of these are a direct consequence of a doctor prescribing these to a patient** (and not the illegal way).

This amazing diet helped me regulate my blood glucose levels much better than any other diet/medicines. The fact that eating fewer carbs is the actual way to building a better health profile can help bring down the worldwide epidemic of diabetes. When your body is short on glucose (or carbs) supply, it turns to the other reservoir of energy, aka, the fat cells. So technically, taking your body to that state where instead of burning glucose you start burning fats is something that will help you lose fats.

Opposed to the popular portrayal of fats in the mainstream media, fat is not the enemy. In fact, the healthy consumption of fats is necessary to ensure healthy sustenance. With your belly fat kicked out of the park and insulin spikes brought down to a minimum, it is evident that a body in ketosis is at a much lower risk for heart diseases and diabetes. Having high visceral fats and/or a high blood sugar level is the most significant contributor to conditions such as cardiac disorders, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity. 

This ensures that your body has lower inflammation levels and thus you end up staying away from a high risk of cancer."

**Studies have proven that this is an effective blood-pressure-lowering diet.**

* You are not caught amidst the blaring horns and honking of mad traffic.
* You get to move and sweat it out
* Walking is the easiest and most natural way to keep your body up and running
* It gives you time to ponder over things
* Makes you more creative - many CEOs now prefer ""walk-and-talk"" meetings for brainstorming ideas
* Lowers stress"
Health,ettkgsx,t3_cdd4wy,1563184865.0,"This is all because the big names in the processed food industry have made it much easier to obtain, store, and consume the processed and refined versions of otherwise healthy foods. You get sugar-laden fruity treats and juices at much cheaper prices than the actual food. Brown rice is more expensive than white rice. Same goes for bread. Rampant commercialization of food esp. in low and middle-income countries is causing this damage."

Psychiatry,ettjw7e,t3_cdcb2q,1563183980.0,""" Although hard to measure, the end result is probably tragic since the ideology against antidepressants keeps those in pain from seeking and sticking to the best available treatment, as once happened to me.

Health,ettjru7,t3_cd8dzg,1563183789.0,"Alzheimer's is a sad byproduct of high neurological inflammation. This might be because of an unhealthy diet, excessive stress, and lack of exercise. Basically, every unhealthy and bad lifestyle habit causes higher build-up inflammatory substances in the body, esp. the brain, since it receives 20% of the body's blood supply. A high sugar intake, thus, affects the brain more than it does to any other organ. Similarly, being chronically stressed is also something that pushes people towards dementia and Alzheimer's."

These kids are gonna be fattened with misinformation and pseudoscience. They are gonna be taught how to arrogantly stick to their ignorance even if every scientific research proves them wrong. They are also gonna be lagging behind so much in their immunity levels compared to the rest of the kids out there.

Health,eti7ayd,t3_cbjifj,1562841220.0,"This is why I think (and a lot of legit doctors will agree with me here) homeopathy is pure charlatanism:

* It rests on the axiom that the thing that causes the disease is actually its cure. So, the virus can kill virus and cancer cells can kill cancer cells.
* Axiom-2-When you take a remedy and dilute it, it becomes stronger.
* There is increase or worsening of severity of the symptoms after the medicines begin.
* This system of medicine doesn't follow its own predictions.
* Time and again it has been proven that it works as a placebo - in most cases, it has been seen that the placebo works high here since there is a long term connection between the patient and the therapist.

Also found an interesting bit of trivia in [an NCBI research paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2291211/)

""  During the Third Reich the (mostly pro-homeopathy) Nazi leadership wanted to solve the homeopathy question once and for all. The research programme was carefully planned and rigorously executed. A report was written and it even survived the war. But it disappeared nevertheless – apparently in the hands of German homeopaths. Why?  """
