NarcissisticAbuse,fiqk535,t3_f92e7d,1582646030.0,"Abuse from my narccistic ex triggered the onset of my bipolar symptoms, which I had unknowingly successfully coped with for most of my life. It was only after I had been gaslit and psychologically abused to the point of losing my sense of reality, that I sought medical help, receiving the diagnosis. Once I began treatment, my nex used the diagnosis of bipolar to discredit me as I began to identify and define the relationship as abusive to my family and friends. 

Processing the trauma, I learned that the only way I could prevent myself from going back to him was to burn out bridges; I talked openly and publicly about the abuse, forcing myself to continue to recognize his behavior as abuse, warn others of the behavior and hopefully help those in similar situations identify psychological and emotional abuse in their relationship.

In response to me exposing him as a narccistic abuser, he took to Facebook to call me ‚Äúemotionally unstable‚Äù, sharing my bipolar diagnosis with the public and letting his audience infer a scenario that was blatantly false. It‚Äôs what he did best; shaped the narrative. He even led his audience to believe he was fearful for his physical safety, to which, when asked by spectator if he actually concerned about his safety, he wrote ‚Äúno, just want her to stop slandering my name‚Äù.

When I threatened legal action against him for publically sharing my diagnosis, he made a bogus allegation about fearing for his physical safety and attempted to file a restraining order to silence me. Determined to tell my story, I counteracted with an actual claim of sexual assault (he masturbated on me in a parking lot without my consent) and we walked away agreeing to stay-away orders on both sides. Not even a month later, as I was leaving my house, my nex parks at the end of my city block, only a few houses down from where I live; and looks in my direction, staring at me. He turns and walks out of sight, around the block, possibly to a favorite restaurant of ours in that direction. Out of all of the city blocks , he chooses the one where he and I once lived together; and I just happen to set foot outside at the exact same time he gets out of his car and looks in the direction of what was once the home we shared. 
 
Looks like is he‚Äôs the emotionally unstable one."

depression,f4wakjk,t3_dlp6ws,1571853722.0,"I have experienced massive memory loss from a combination of bipolar/depression/trauma and substance abuse. I hardly remember most of my life; I have chosen to block out my most traumatic experiences and phases to the point where I can‚Äôt quite name the specifics of the abuse from my long term ex-partner, just the feelings of fear and despair from the way he treated me. 

Most of my childhood has been deleted; I‚Äôm the eldest hearing child of three; both my parents are Deaf.  As the eldest, growing up meant taking on a lot of responsibility to help my parents communicate with the world while personally trying to navigate both hearing and Deaf cultures was incredibly confusing, isolating and difficult. Note: My parents maintain that they never asked me to take on the burden, and that as I child I was insistent on volunteering to interpret and took great pride in the culture (the latter which I can confirm). 

I remember oscillating from great feelings of anxiety and anger to a dark place of low self esteem as a child; but can‚Äôt specifically remember what events led me to feel that way. Despite my ability to openly express my frustration and struggles to my mother when I was a child, my parents never had me evaluated for any sort of mental illness; my first therapy session was at the age of 26. I was later diagnosed with Bipolar 2, Major Depression, ADHD, Anxiety and mild OCD and only began psychiatric treatment at a age 28.

I feel like my memory loss is a large part of why I find myself repeating the same pattern; I can‚Äôt remember why I shouldn‚Äôt walk down a path, only knowing that my choice might be bad for my health, yet that ominous feeling isn‚Äôt enough to deter me and I continue to repeat the same problematic behavior.

Working on sobriety and getting serious outpatient treatment, exercising and taking time for myself. I turn 30 next year; would love to start with a fresh(er) slate."
