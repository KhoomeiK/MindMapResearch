If they just added that if agent gets destroyed you get your permanents back it would be acceptable.  Some of these fixes are so easy.

Or hot take: maybe arena and paper become two slightly different things and you change things in arena because it’s a digital format and extremely easy to modify.  That one is too much for wotc though.

This is just coming from someone who only wants to play arena exclusively.  I have zero interest in paper magic anymore.  I think it’s a wasteful game (You can keep getting a hundred copies of the same shit from boosters) that just ends up taking space in your house."

You should start deck building early, don’t just rip everything from online.  You’ll get actually good at this game from building your own decks and seeing what does and doesn’t work.  Some things beginners do a lot of is just throwing in as many rares and mythics as possible and thinking it’s a good deck.  Another is just putting in a ton of high cost creatures with no early/mid game ramp, so you get stuck and just lose because you’re unable to play anything.

Do your research on cards and watch really good players to see what can be done.  I wouldn’t play an advanced deck until you have a very good handle on the game.

You have one where you are super motivated and kill it, 3 that are average but you get it done, and 1 where you are tired/feel like shit and just get it over with.  You were only motivated for 1/5 but you still did 5.  Long term working out is a lot like this.

You will almost never be motivated at the start of a session too, but it will happen part way through or once you get warmed up.  Just start doing something and you’ll complete it.  Almost nobody gets half way through a workout then quits, so reach that no going back point.

Neither of them are going to learn to fight well in the timeframe they have, and this whole fight will probably just come down to luck.  I’m gonna go with the reach advantage though.  Keeping your opponent distanced takes away a lot of need for skill.

I’m also gonna add that Thor is a guy who is very trainable because he’s a humble guy.  I think he’s going to get a lot of out training with a pro because he’ll follow the plan and learn like a sponge.  I see eddies ego being a massive problem here."
