learnmath,fn2ifjv,t3_fym8ns,1586590167.0,"One of the problems where it would matter is collision of Infinitesimal small circular disks. The distinction that the point masses are circular shaped matters a lot.

You will need to solve for arbitary radius first and limit radius to 0 to get a meaningful answer. You would expect very different results if you consider square shaped point masses instead of circular.

You need to define circle with radius >= 0 or square with side >= 0 in order to overcome these type of situations.

Shape matters while dealing with infinitesimals. But make sure that the limit as radius approach 0 exists. In case of colission of circular disks they do exist. 

A more practical example would be colission along corner of a square shape. The normal at a vertex of square can not be defined uniquely unless you consider its vertices to be an infinitesimal small circle(circle of radius 0).

TLDR: Depends on your problem, everything is fine only if limit  of the properties you want to calculate exists as radius tends to 0."

It's very natural to be angry when these ignorant fanatics talk about their ""faith"" with so much pride. Even Richard Dawkins is visibility irritated by their ignorance, stubbornness and stupidity. Understand that these qualities are cultivated into relegious people(how else would they follow a religion for lifetime?)


Consider this conversation:

R: Being gay is bad.

A: How can you say if anything is inherently good or bad?

R: My relegion taught me

A: So is murder wrong?

R: Yes, absolutely

A: So french revolution (or any other example based on his knowledge) was wrong?

R: Now that is an exception

A: ohh so American revolution was wrong?

R: no they were raising voice against wrong doings, you don't get the point.

A: I am doing the same. How do you know who was right? 

...

It's really fun to make people think like this, sometimes they get infuriated because of self contradiction. But some very important basic points are:

- it's not your responsibility to make them understand

- you can control their emotional state of mind if you know how they think. If you don't then do try to understand it. Try to find out their flaws by asking the right questions.

- Always speak respectfully no matter what words you use. Now, no matter what you say, people will get defensive if you challenge their views directly. A better approach would be to question them respectfully on every point that they make.



Rule of thumb before discussing with ignorant people:
1. identifying what you want to convey.
2. Identifying how you want to convey.


Coming back to your problem,

You need to answer yourself these questions first:

1. How much dependent are you on your family? 

2. How staunch are people in your community? (generally more intelligent people are less staunch)



Let me elaborate further:

1. Relegious people don't know how to hold discussion, so in case of family it's a common pattern that even if you give better arguments against relegion you will have to give in to their tradition if you are financially dependent on them. It varies family to family but financial independence is a key if you want to be able to discuss things openly with your parents. In case of family you would want them to understand your view point, so it's not just about proving anyone right or wrong. TV Series like Young Sheldon shows how it is to live with radically different people, you might find it relatable.

2. This is more important point because it sometimes becomes a matter of life and death. As someone from India i can discuss these things only in closed rooms or anonymously on the internet. ""Thank Science for Internet!!"" Pressing the wrong people in the right way is sure shot way to get killed in India(be it Islam or Hinduism).



This should give you some idea about what you wamt to say and what you don't want to say to ignorant people.



Finally, i feel lucky that i can discuss everything freely with family (after becoming financially independent ofcs), because many people, especially women in developing nations, can't even do that. I know it's hard but there are a lot others like us and we are the ones who collectively bring change to system and society. But the change comes slowly, so hold on, external things are not going to get any better anytime soon, but it becomes easy after a while.
