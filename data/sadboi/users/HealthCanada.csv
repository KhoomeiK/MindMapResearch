My anxiety however has worsened. Constantly worrying about his safety while he’s young and vulnerable. Worrying what would happen to him if their was a natural disaster or war in our area. So many worries while he’s so young and dependant on me. 
Children are so innocent. Trying to protect his innocence is a worry all on its own."

Nothing I’ve tried has worked so far with removing the smell.
bipolar,fb6bvq3,t3_ebmqrx,1576546461.0,"Being bipolar is fun, isn’t it? It’s made me extremely skilled at hurting people close to me. In my defence, people close to me don’t know when to back off and leave me alone when I tell them to. I feel like a Spanish bull with swords pierced thru my skin, irritated and In pain but the audience persists on provoking me instead of helping because they all want a show. 
I don’t know how supportive your boyfriend is of your illness. I also don’t know how your boyfriend chooses to talk to you when you’re fighting with him. 
But I’ve learned that you have to be a VERY supportive and understanding partner in order to make a relationship work with someone who is bipolar.
If you’re with someone who doesn’t understand, or pokes you when you’re on your emotional roller coaster, then you’ll always fight and be unhappy. Happiness is achievable if you’re with someone who is right for you and understands the motions and phases of a bipolar personality and instead of continuing fighting, they step back and think of ways to try and help and de-escalate the situation. 
Reading your post made me feel sad because I know your exact feelings, they’re all too relatable. Feelings of emptiness and helplessness because you feel like all you do is push people away and hurt people. You feel like you’ll be alone forever with just you and the chaos inside your head.
Try not to blame yourself too much. I know how easy it is to sit there and call yourself an idiot or a loser or a fuck up. But you’re not. You are strong, believe me. 
When I’m having really bad days I try my hardest to look at my illness as a positive thing. A thing of strength, that a ‘normal’ person might not be able to deal with. We see things differently and I think it makes us more understanding and empathetic towards others who are suffering because we understand pain and depression so well, it’s one of our daily battles. 
I can’t give you much relationship advice because my boyfriend is probably the most unsupportive and least understanding person for me to be with considering he thinks mental Illnesses are a joke and an “excuse” for people to behave poorly. But I truly believe that if someone loves you, they will understand you and want to support you in all ways possible. They will see you no matter how far lost the real you is, and they will see you for you and not for your illness. 
If your guy loves you as much as you love him, he will understand. Stay positive. This isn’t the end. You need to keep going, keep moving. Even if your relationship is actually over for good, remember there is a silver lining to everything, and it may not be clear yet but in time you will see it. 
Every time we fall, we learn. So get back up and put your gear back on. You have many more battles ahead to fight. All you can do is stay strong and take it one day at a time. Accept that there will always be bad days and that’s ok! Bad days are ok. Bad days help us progress. I’ve learnt A LOT about myself from complete failure and humiliation. At the time, of course, I wish I could’ve died but looking back I’ve realized how every mistake has helped me grow and learn and become a better version of me. It’s so easy to want to cave and just disappear and be done with it but please don’t, keep on going. Know your worth and know you’re better than this illness that tells you lie after lie about yourself. 
If you ever want to talk, I’m here, I’m listening and I’m always understanding. 
Hope your day gets better ♥️"
bipolar,fb65sc2,t1_fb4v5wo,1576542083.0,"Wow is this ever relatable right now. I feel like I’m not even aloud to have a bad day anymore because it’s just brushed off as being “crazy”. My regular (non-bipolar) emotions are no longer being validated as normal human emotions, all they see now is crazy. So basically no one gives a shit. It’s very frustrating being apart of a family who doesn’t ‘believe’ in mental illness...in their eyes you’re either normal or you’re not. So my mental illness now deems me as crazy and the support has become non existing. After almost nine years together with my boyfriend I’m realizing that it’s probably time to put this relationship to rest. It hurts more than he realizes to be called crazy by someone who is supposed to love you. The lack of support and understanding from him and his family isn’t healthy for me. 
For example, today my cat killed a bird and I was upset. I’m very empathetic. Bipolar or not this would have affected me all the same. But apparently my feelings of sadness were coming off as ‘annoying’ and he proceeded to sit there mocking my words and telling me I’m acting crazy again. So in other words I’m not aloud to express any emotion without it being related to my mental illness. 
Sorry for rant. Like I said, I have no one to talk to about my illness who understands it. So to answer your question, I personally find it easier keeping it to yourself."

bipolar,f4kczob,t3_dkfb23,1571646468.0,"Being bipolar sucks. I hate the periods of mania where you become self aware of being in a manic state.
It’s like, you feel like you’re getting ahold of your life again, things are going smooth, you have this great ‘unstoppable’ attitude where nothing will bring you down, your house is staying clean, you’re social with your friends, you’re putting effort into your appearance, you feel like things are just getting better and better and then BAM!! It hits you. You realize it can only mean one thing. Things are not getting better and better, this is just the calm before the storm. You realize that you’ve peaked your mania stage and it’s only a matter of a few days before your ‘unstoppable’ attitude turns into this frantic, depressive, anxious state of mind where everything makes you cry and your entire body feels heavy. You’re full of self doubt and everything sets you off emotionally. Youre tired but when the time for sleep comes you can’t sleep and you just lay there restlessly thinking of depressing scenarios in your head, causing yourself anxiety, thinking about how messed up you are and how better off everyone around you would be if you just disappeared. Suddenly you’re back to avoiding your friends again, partially because you genuinely don’t feel like seeing anybody, and partially because your friends can’t quite understand these types of moods and you fear that eventually they’ll get fed up with your negativity so you’ve learned that it’s best to avoid people during the depressive periods. Day to day activities seem like an impossible chore and you just sit there looking at the mess feeling helpless and overwhelmed. All you want to do is cry and be alone. It’s confusing for everyone around you. 
Sometimes I feel like I have a really good grip on my disorder, and other times I feel like I’m losing control over it. I feel like two totally different people when I’m manic and when I’m depressive. I just want to be understood but I can’t even understand myself half the time so I’m constantly in a battle. 
I just subscribed to this subreddit tonight. Im day 3 into my depressive state and I had an episode at my brothers birthday dinner. I’m feeling pretty low right now. I thought I’d come here to see how other people manage their disorder and maybe it will help me with mine."
history,f4b0oz9,t1_f47if5n,1571504724.0,"Your logic makes no sense. 
If my mother/child/someone I loved was murdered, and the son of the murderer came up to me and said “my father is a murderer. Murder is wrong” and started advocating against murderers, in no way would I laugh at him and say “wow how ironic, you’re against murdering yet your dad was a murderer! What a joke!”.
No.
I would say “good for you for recognizing what your father did was wrong and advocating against it” 
Not everyone is the west, even during colonialism, is/was all for colonialism, or racism, etc. There are many people who are against this, even though it was our ancestors who did it. 
So it’s not ironic for people in the west to advocate for human rights, equality, and just a better world in general."
