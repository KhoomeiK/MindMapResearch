This statement should resonate with all other therapist. Remember that and be completely honest with what you're comfortable sharing and if you're to anxious to share anything do it anyways. I only got very comfortable with my therapist because I told her things I thought were stupid or she would judge me for, but every response she gave was never negative.

Honeslty, in all my sessions I dissociated but didnt feel the need to tell her because I was still grounded enough to absorb her feedback and explain my feelings. 

I only cried during one of my sessions because it was extremely deep and personal but she didnt seem phased at all and everything felt normal and not awkward. 

Btw I knew I was doing therapy right when I felt a bit lighter each time I left. Even though I had the worst anxiety in there, I came out better and over time my anxiety became less bothersome for me.

I hope this helped. Reach out if you want to ask more about my sessions and advice. There are no such thing as dumb questions."

Anxiety makes everything harder but you cant let it stop you from experiencing a job. Especially since its inevitable.

 I think the experience has been ok so far. It can be overwhelming with having to learn so much. Especially learning to take orders on the register, but whenever I get too anxious, I pull through till the orders get slower and I do breathing exercises till I feel better. Also you learn to adjust to the stress and over time you can train yourself to be less anxious about work.

 There are also various resources to learn how to make drinks. Like asking for help from a co worker or videos on the dunkin university.

I think it's a good first job. It really does depend on location how busy you get or the customers you have."

Like laying in a pool of jello and sinking. Disoriention, yeah if it's bad enough my body could just go on auto pilot and I wouldn't even know what I was doing at the time.

Dissociation,few3hhl,t3_eqlfin,1579404818.0,"I dont know if you're taking constructive criticism. If you're not then don't bother checking my comment and have a nice day :)

There was one specific line that bothered me while I was reading:
The therapist looked at me apologetically, ‚Äú I can tell by your reaction something is triggering a memory for you. What are you thinking about right now?‚Äù

I've only ever been to one therapist. I don't know what your experience is(probably more than mine), but I learned from my sessions, it's not a therapist job to pry or make them talk about things they feel uncomfortable or not ready to talk about at that moment. This line felt forceful to me. I understand the therapist wanted to know the trigger but it seems more appropriate to me to ask the patient, ""Is something wrong?"" Rather than, ""I know you're panicking tell me why? What happened? What's going on?"" I thought it felt almost like forcing them into a corner. Without giving the patient space to express themselves correctly, without pressure or worry. 

Anyways that was my two cents. Take it with a grain of salt or however you please. Aside from that line I love the direction you're taking with this story and I feel the description of dissociation is very accurate. It really felt like you took the words right out of my mouth. Are you planning on writing alot more or a more shorter story? Keep up the good work! :)"
