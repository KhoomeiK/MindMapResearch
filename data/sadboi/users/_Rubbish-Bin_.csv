~~Oh, you’re approaching me?~~ “Sir Knight, I ask you once again to step aside and allow us to pass,” he replied to the Knight.    

Upon seeing the knight not attack but move, Azrael decided to attack once again. He swung his flamberge sword downwards once again, aiming for the Knight’s left shoulder, in the hopes of cutting off his left arm. If it worked then hopefully that would guarantee that the Knight couldn’t use his weapon... unless he could hold it with one of his feet which Azrael wouldn’t really be surprised by after all the things he’s seen so far.   

*”Monty Python and the Holy Grail... please don’t fail me now,”* he said in his head.

He felt warm and weak, nauseous, dizzy, and shaky. He would have a tremor every few moments. The worst part was the overwhelming sense of fear, self-hatred, and guilt that swarmed over him.   

He focused on trying to calm the kid instead of the panic attack and the voices in his head. He made sure to keep a safe distance between the two of them. He knew what it felt like to be in moments like this. He knew not to reach out for the other.    

“It’s okay. I’m not a threat. I won’t hurt you,” Azrael spoke in a soft tone, his voice a bit weak and shaky from the anxiety attack and voices."

He loved to just sit out in the nature and read. However, he didn’t look like he went outside much. His skin was extremely pale.   

He was snapped out of his book when he heard sobbing and saw a child under the pine tree. He closed his book and approached the child.   

Azrael kneeled down to her height and looked at her out of concern. His normally cold look that filled his grey eyes was instead one of worry and warmth.  

“What’s wrong?” he asked her in a quiet and gentle voice."
CampHalfBloodRP,fqs3rqm,t1_fqo5ps0,1589597857.0,"Azrael unsheathed his sword. He knew of no other way but to fight. They had to fight. At least he thought they did. Perhaps the knight would stand stil and let him cut off his arm..? He hoped so.   

“My apologies, knight, but we must get through,” he apologized.   

With those words, he swung his sword downwards, aiming at the knight’s right shoulder, to try and cut the knight’s arm off like in the movie. The arm made the most sense to aim for because it was sort of used to control a weapon and that’s what was next in the movie scene. Plus, maybe the knight was right handed?

CampHalfBloodRP,fqs2it2,t1_fqnvsyp,1589597057.0,"Azrael’s eyes widened when he saw the creatures go onto the ship. He had no idea what they were. Were they in books? He really should’ve spent more time reading about ancient monsters instead of romance novels and fantasy books.    

He was snapped out of his thoughts when one of them hurt Mercury. Now that pissed him off. He couldn’t care less if they were to attack him, but Mercury was a different story. No one hurts Mercury.   

He tried to kick the monster away from Mercury. He had no idea if they’d be able to defeat them. Their biggest priority at the moment was to not get killed and get into the Underworld. They needed to keep them back.   

He tried to get loose from his bindings. He grasped at the hilt of his sword and pulled it out as much as he could. He held the sword against the rope with his chin. With that, he used his hands to move the rope up and down against the blade of his sword. Eventually the rope broke and he was free, although his chin was a bit red from the hilt pressing against it. He inwardly thanked those ‘life hacks that could save your life’ videos that he used to watch. He then cut Cel’s bindings.      

“We’re going to need to hold them off long enough until we get into the Underworld. I have no idea if we’ll be able to kill them so just try not to get yourselves killed,” Azrael informed his teammates, a sense of panic in his voice.   

With those words, he unsheathed his sword and wielded it. He started to have an adrenaline rush as his body realized the life or death situation he was in. He pulled Mercury behind him as a way to keep him protected since he was injured.

“Cel, would you be able to help me hold them back? Your bow will probably be good for that. And, Mercury, would you be able to help from afar with magic? If not then don’t push yourself. You’re injured,” he tried his best to give out a battle strategy, “And ghostly crew, I want you guys to go back to and focus on keeping the ship together. Continue to sail us down the Acheron into the Underworld. We need to get into the Underworld as soon as possible. My teammates and I will hold off these creatures and keep them from hurting you guys. We’ll er... keep you guys safe. So get to it!”   

There wasn’t really a way for the ghosts to actually get hurt. At least not that he was aware of. However, he felt that maybe if he told the ghost that then they’d calm down a bit.

CampHalfBloodRP,fqkiupo,t1_fqgqodv,1589428274.0,"Azrael stopped trying to break loose from the ropes when he felt Mercury’s hand in his. It didn’t calm him or stop the horrible things he was being told and seeing, but it did help bring him back to earth, well, Underworld.   

He was on a ship, in the middle of the Acheron, on a quest with a team whilst having an anxiety attack. At least the anxiety attack helped to distract him somewhat. He never thought there would be a day where he would be grateful for an anxiety attack.   

Cel’s magic brought in a slightly calming aura. It wasn’t too much, but it definitely was appreciated and helped. However, he frowned upon noticing Cel’s weariness. Maybe Cel would be able to take a small nap? He’d offer up his shoulder for Cel to use. They probably had time because of the boat ri- and he thought too soon.   

The cackling got most of his attention, minus the part split between focusing on his anxiety and the part trying to combat the voices. He looked up upon being addressed.   

“Silence, please,” he spoke to the crew in Ancient Greek before turning his attention fully to the experienced sailor, “Except you. Please, untie us first. Also, if it is possible, may three spirits of the ghostly crew be sent out to scout the area and see who or what made the noise? Also, do you know what is happening? Thank you.”   

They were most likely going to have to fight. Normally Azrael was fine with laughing. Creepy cackling from out of nowhere, however? That was a hell-to-the-fucking-no. He hoped he’d be in a decent fighting condition if battle was needed. He was a bit shaky from fear and from the screams, but he’d have to ignore it.   

He looked to Cel, “We’re most likely going to be attacked. Would you have the strength to fight? If not then Mercury and I will fight them and try to keep them from getting near you. Okay?”   

He then addressed Mercury, “You cool with that, Dolphin?”

“But what can we do? I’m not quite sure brute force would work. Look at him. If we attack with no strategy, we’ll most likely lose. If we try to sneak past, he’ll hear our footsteps. If the only way is to attack then our best shot would be to try and hit him in the same spots as in the script or try to find a weakness in his armor or come up with a fighting strategy. Unless you know of a plan that might work... then that’s the best bet we really have,” Azrael frowned, “If we’re going to fight then I’ll attack first if you’d prefer.”

He cringed at the fastness of the trireme and the fact that it could break judging by how beaten down it looked. He never was a fan of boats, especially when they went fast and didn’t look very stable. If he had known they were going to go sailing, he would’ve packed ginger drops.   

Azrael rested his head on the wood as he clenched his eyes shut and continued to cry. He was starting to have an anxiety attack on top of everything. His breathing had noticeable quickened. He felt unbearably warm. He felt nauseous and dizzy and weak. He had tremors every now and again. He was shaking.   

He couldn’t tell if his fear of boats made things worse with the voices or better. Half of his thoughts were ‘We’re going to die. This ship is going to crash. I’m going to end up vomiting. I should’ve just stayed at camp and continued to play Animal Crossing. Fuck my life.’. The other half, however, was still trying to fight the voices and keep himself semi-sane.   

The voices continued to try and convince him to jump in the water or stab himself with his sword. They told him he wouldn’t be a nuisance anymore if he just went into the Acheron. Everyone would be happier without him. He’d also be at peace if he went in is what they told him. He’d be free. He wouldn’t be in constant misery anymore. He’d be happy and calm.   

If it wasn’t for him being tied, he would’ve ended it right there whether it be by sword or by the Acheron. However, despite his efforts of trying to break lose, he couldn’t.   

He needed to calm down. He was thinking irrationally. He needed to help his teammates calm down. The singing didn’t help. His teammates probably couldn’t even hear it. He needed a distraction...   

“Hey,” he weakly started, his voice as shaky as his body, “Let’s try and name different colors. I’ll start. Crimson, sea foam green, fuchsia...”   

It was a trick his mum had taught him. She said it’s what she does with anxiety to distract her mind. She also taught him to try and say the ABCs backwards, but he had done it so many times that he had it memorized now. Colors were fun, and there were a lot so it would probably last them awhile.

He glanced over at the other two for a moment. He felt like Cel didn’t like him which caused the river to say **“No one likes you.”**. He told himself that there were people who liked him. Mercury, Luna, his mum... However, the voices just continued to spin lies about them.  

While Cel was able to quickly put on a happy act, Azrael wasn’t. He looked weary and had a look of pure anguish as the voices continued.   

**”You don’t deserve any form of love. You always abandon your loved ones. You left your mum to die. You left her and your sister with a broken family that you broke. You left Carter when he was crying and begging for you to stay. You abandoned all of them. You threw them away. You only care about yourself and your own needs. You don’t even care about your mother. You left her behind. You left her to die. You left her with your stepfather. You abandoned her. Your family would be happy if you would join us. They’d be happy without you. Your stepfather would be happy if you were gone. He hates you, and so do your mother and sister. You broke the relationship between your mother and stepfather. All their fights are about you. They’re happy now that you aren’t there. They’d be even happier if you joined us in the river.**    

That made Azrael cry. Tears pooled up in his eyes before they started to bead and fall from his eyes. He didn’t bother wiping them away. He just let the tears fall and walked onto the trireme and gave a small wave bye to the Oracle.   

He looked at the rope and cut it in three, so they can each be tied down to the ship. He then went over and tied Cel to the mast as he cried. Normally he would crack a joke about it like any normal teenager would. However, at the moment, the only thing Azrael could focus on was fighting against the voices.    

With that he silently handed two ropes to Mercury, one for him to be tied down with and one for Mercury to be tied down with. He sat down and waited for Mercury to tie him down. He would then try his best to assist Mercury with the task of, well, tying Mercury.   

The word ‘trierarch’ helped jog Azrael’s memory about the time when he was forced to learn about the ship for a history.  

He spoke in Ancient Greek, as that’s what the spirits had spoken in, which was quite torturous when he had voices screaming at him and since it wasn’t technically a first language.

He listened to the Oracle of the Dead and nodded, a frown on his face, “I see...”   

It was a shame that the Oracle couldn’t come along. He must’ve been lonely. He wondered if the other spirits talked to him.   

“Got it,” he responded to the Oracle of the Dead.  

He was relieved that it was only his own blood he had to spill at the moment. He could handle that. Also pain helped ease the mind. At least it did for him. It would provide him a bit of a distraction and some relief from the river.   

However, judging by the way the spirit said ‘go’, he assumed the spirit meant that his teammates better get up and sacrificing or else things would go down. With that, he unsheathed his sword and looked at the other two.   

“We each need to make a blood sacrifice to the shrine of the King of the Underworld. Our own blood, that is. I suggest we get to it if you guys want to make it past the Acheron,” Azrael explained, leaving no room for argument, “We have to get moving. Plus, Hades deserves the sacrifices.”

He hoped the plan would work. If not then they would most likely be dead, well, temporarily dead. However, he must have hope and not be pessimistic!

He’d re-go over in his mind how it could work out, but after the first sentence his mind already got bored with it and started to think of more interesting things.

He turned his attention back to the Oracle of the Dead. What exactly was happening again? Oh. He wanted to speak to his grandparents and cousin, and he also wanted to prove himself worthy to Hades. But why did he want to prove himself to Hades? What did Hades ever do for him? He never even paid child support. Why should he care what Hades thinks about him?    

That was the river messing with his head. He needed to just try and ignore it more. The river seemed welcoming to him though.   

What did he have to prove? That he was a coward? That he always runs away? That he practically left his mum to die at home? The river was very hard to resist. Why did he try to resist? What was the point in him living? The river would be his freedom....    

“Pardon me, sir, but I’m going to have to talk to you from afar,” he apologized to the spirit, hoping the spirit would get angry.

He looked over at Mercury, hoping he would follow, before he went over to Cel and kneeled down to his level. He pulled Cel into a tight hug and closed his eyes.   

“Cel, the river is lying. It’s trying to trick you. All the things it’s saying to you are lies,” he informed Cel, “It wants you to react this way, but you have to try not to give in.”   

His heart ached at the Oracle’s words. He was alone. His brothers had already left. He wondered if the Oracle of the Dead might be able to come with them on the journey. Would they be able to reunite him with his brothers?    

“A sacrifice? As in... something or someone that is dead?” He hesitantly asked the Oracle, “Also, do you know if it would be possible for you to come with us? If you wanted would you be able to cross the river with us?”   

After that, he turned his attention back to Cel. He pulled away but held onto Cel’s hands and looked at him. He had no idea what Cel was seeing or hearing, but he could tell it was effecting him a lot.   

“I’m sorry for not coming over sooner, Cel. Please don’t listen to The Acheron. It’s trying to use your fears and pain against you. I know that it’s hard, but you’re strong. I know I just met you, but I can tell you’re really strong,” he tried to reassure Cel.

That was a first for Azrael to hear someone say that to him. He appreciated it. It would seem that those words Evan had said would mean a lot to him because they did.   

“You’ve been really nice to me too. I’m glad you see me as your friend. I think of you as my friend, so... I’m glad you do too,” Azrael quietly replied.   

He’d never say it aloud, but he had always felt lonely growing up. Books couldn’t block out everything. No matter how desperately he tried to hide and get lost into his books, they’d never fully block out the world or his emotions.   

Azrael continued to search the sky for The Huntress. He searched the sky for the cluster of stars that looked like a girl getting ready to shoot her bow."
CampHalfBloodRP,fow6vvm,t1_fovm0lb,1588114119.0,"Azrael looked back at Cel and frowned. He wanted to go over and help him, but he figured that wouldn’t go down well with the spirit. He needed to stay and continue talking to the spirit. He’d have to help later.   

**”You’re selfish. You always put yourself before others. No wonder no one likes you. You’re greedy. You’re selfish. You’re envious. Think of how many lives would be better if you just jumped into the river.”**   

Azrael ignored the voices as best as he could. He needed to focus on the task at hand. Azrael shook his head at the Oracle of Death’s words even though he wouldn’t be able to see it. That wasn’t the reason he came down. That was just what they had to do. If he had only done it to mimic Heracles, a hero he didn’t even like, then he would’ve joined all the Olympics.   

“No, it’s not. My main reasons for coming to the Underworld is to learn more about it and to try and talk to Lord Hades. I’ve also come down to try and find some answers about my cousin and to see my grandparents if possible. I want to know if a few certain people made it to Elysium or not. I also want to talk to a few spirits. I certainly didn’t come down just to mimic Heracles. That... would probably be one of the last things I’d ever want to do. I’ve come for answers and to speak to some of my family members,” Azrael explained as best he could.

There was another thing, but he wanted to check with Mercury first. He wanted to see if Mercury would want to know.    

The river still continued to distract him, showing him different images. One was an image of his mother crying on the couch, another of his mum and stepfather arguing.    

**”Look at all the pain you’ve caused your mother. Because of you she suffered from two strokes. Because of you she had to quit her job. Because of you she always fights with your stepfather. You caused her so much stress. She hates you. She regrets having you. You ruined her life. Your family would be happier if you were dead. You’re just a nuisance. They hate you. No one loves you. You don’t deserve love. Join us in the river.”**   

He kept glancing at the river every few seconds. He wanted to jump. He wanted to so badly. He’d be better off dead.   

“May you please help us?” Azrael asked.

I don’t have as high of a pain tolerance as you do, but I still have a pretty high pain tolerance and some injuries hurt especially if you have a lot of them,” Azrael explained.     

He watched as Evan seemed to ponder. When Evan turned and smiled at him with a smile that was noticeably more sincere, Azrael returned it with an equally sincere smile.    

“Evan,... you shouldn’t be made to constantly be in pain and absorb it without a complaint. You don’t deserve that. No one deserves that, especially you.”    

He unconsciously played with the end of his jacket sleeve as he talked. However, his attention was fully on Evan. When Even looked back up at the sky, Azrael did as well. He looked up at the many stars as he searched through them once again to try and find The Huntress that Evan had showed him.    

Upon hearing Evan’s next words, his smile turned more warm and his eyes shined a small hint of happiness as he looked up at the stars, “Do you really think so?”"

Sometimes I would look out the window of my bedroom at night to try and see the stars, but it usually was too dark,” Azrael’s mouth curved into a small frown, “I didn’t leave my house much either. It wasn’t really the safest area... None of it really was. I hurt myself a lot too on top of it. My mum would sometimes joke about how I always managed to injure myself in some way.”    

The sky was beautiful though. He wished he had paid more attention to it, even the clouds. Although, it was rarely sunny out not that he minded. He got easily sunburnt. Still, it would’ve been nice to step into the sun sometimes...    

“Speaking of injuries, how are you? I remember when we first met, you were pretty bruised up. Is your shoulder okay now? I’m sorry about the shoulder and all the other injuries... If I had known you’d absorb my pain I would’ve avoided shaking your hand,” Azrael worried, “If you have some injuries though, I could help with some of them. I can heal the more minor injuries like minor cuts or bruises. I also know basic first aid so.... I can help? I don’t like seeing people hurt especially if they’re a frie- someone really nice.”   

He wasn’t sure if Evan considered him a friend. He wasn’t really good with knowing who considered him a friend and who he should consider a friend. He never had any before, but Evan wasn’t making fun of him and was instead politely talking with him so... did that count?"

The reply of the man along with his stance reminded him of a familiar movie he had once watched. Maybe that was what this was? It seemed like something Nike would do. Maybe they had to act the scene out? Problem was, they fought in the scene. What if they wouldn’t be able to successfully sever off the knight’s arms and legs? Maybe it would be fine as long as they quoted the script.   

With that he looked at Mercury for a moment and hoped Mercury would understand as soon as he did the horse gallop. Mercury probably would since he was a massive geek. Plus, that movie was amazing. How could you not have seen it? How could you not have seen anything at least relating to Monty Python?   

He remembered Mercury loved acting, so he thought... maybe Mercury would want to play as King Arthur? If he didn’t then Azrael would play King Arthur instead, and Mercury could play as Patsy.   

With that final thought, he mocked a horse galloping with his feet and moved his hand up and down and made his best impression of a clopping. He tried his best to not get embarrassed with having to do this. He then gave a small, barely noticeable motion to Mercury.

Azrael looked at the knight on the bridge. They definitely wouldn’t be able to get through by force. If there was only one knight guarding the bridge then he is most likely an extremely talented and dangerous knight.   

He looked at Mercury before taking one more step so he was at the start of the bridge but not on it. He gave a bow to the knight out of respect.   

“Sir, may we please cross this bridge?” he asked.

CampHalfBloodRP,fosojup,t1_fos9v4l,1588034821.0,"Azrael listened to the story with high interest. He felt sorry for Artemis. It must’ve been terrible losing a close friend especially when she had died trying to rescue Lady Artemis. He wondered if Lady Artemis had blamed herself at the time. The Huntress sounded brave. Well, she obviously must’ve been. He could see why she was Evan’s favorite constellation.    

“She lives through the constellation. She’ll forever sail the night sky,” Azrael remarked as he looked at the constellation shining brightly in the dark night sky."
CampHalfBloodRP,fosh8z3,t1_fortb8o,1588030670.0,"Azrael was a bit surprised that Derek had never been to the Underworld before. He didn’t really know why he was surprised.    

As for the whole friend thing, it was good that it hadn’t been taken as an insult. He hadn’t meant it to sound rude. He just meant that he’d take the compliment. Similar to Ward, he also preferred a small group of people that he was close to and could trust. However, he would never throw a party and would rarely go to a party.    

“I’ve never met her. However, I’m assuming that she’s pretty cool if you’re with her,” Azrael shrugged.   

If Ward were to have said that comment about Mercury aloud, Azrael would have fully agreed with it. Mercury sometimes, well a lot of the time, had a habit of not thinking before acting."
CampHalfBloodRP,for90m7,t1_foqpqqs,1588008224.0,"“It takes time to get close to people. You guys will probably get closer as time goes on,” Azrael reassured.   

His attention was diverted when Evan suddenly pointed to a certain cluster of stars. He followed where Evan would point as he talked about the constellation. His smile warmed as he started to see her. She was beautiful.   

“What makes her your favorite?” Azrael curiously asked."
CampHalfBloodRP,for5y30,t1_foprrdc,1588006732.0,"Azrael had been severely shaken up by the river. His eyes were wide with fear and anguish, and his breathing was quick. If someone were to pay attention, they would notice that every few moments his arms would tremor.   

He grasped onto Mercury as soon as Mercury pulled him closer. He was slowly pulled out of his trance by Mercury. He repeated what Mercury said in his head. He was safe. It was just the river.      

He whispered a shaky “thank you” to Mercury before he let go. He did his best to ignore the memories and voices. He blinked away his tears and put on his best façade of indifference. His eyes still showed a look of fear and his voice sounded rather weak when he talked but other than that he seemed fine.   

“It’s just The Acheron causing all this. Don’t listen to it,” he said aloud although he wasn’t quite sure if he was saying it more to himself than his teammates.   

He followed where Cel was going and as he walked, he gained more of his confidence back. He still was quite fearful and shaken up though as the river kept messing with his mind.   

When the spirit talked he felt himself mostly pull himself together as he focused on the spirit instead of the Acheron. He cleared his throat when the Oracle of the Dead spoke directly to him. He fully fixed his posture and spoke as calmly as he could.   

“Our intentions are to enter the Underworld and ask Lord Hades for permission to bring his dog Cerberus to the mortal world without harming him. We will then bring Cerberus up to the mortal world after befriending him to take him on a walk to the mortal world and complete the twelfth Olympic,” Azrael informed the Oracle of the Dead.   

He wondered if the other two could also hear the spirit or if Azrael just looked crazy to them at the moment.

The girlfriend part peaked Azrael’s curiosity as it did with most people. He had an underlying urge to tease his brother about her like most siblings do, but he didn’t. He didn’t have the energy for joking around. ~~Maybe he’d tease Derek about it later.~~    

“Mina? What’s she like? Is she nice?” he found himself asking."
CampHalfBloodRP,fopoc3i,t1_fopid1q,1587967046.0,"“That’s great,” Azrael commented with a hint of a smile, “I’m glad to hear things are looking up to you. You seem like you deserve to have things looking up for you. You’re really nice.”    

Azrael looked at the moon. It appeared to be a waxing crescent. Pretty soon it would be a first quarter moon. He remembered when he had to record the moon’s phases each day for school a few years ago. The moon. His sister was named after the moon. He wondered how she was doing.        

“I’ve only talked to Ward so far. He seems pretty cool. I sorta look up to him in a way. None of them have bothered me yet, so they’ve been treating me nicely. I like my space,” Azrael shrugged, “How have your relatives been treating you? Are you guys close?”"

He noticed Evan and decided to approach him. Evan had helped him out when he first arrived at camp. He enjoyed talking to Evan that day. With that he hesitantly walked up to the son of Achos.

“Hey, Ward. Also, you can just call me Julian. I’ve realized that ‘Azi’ sounds way to childish for my liking,” he replied with a shrug, “And, yeah, I’m settling in well.

He took a slice of plain, white, and Hawaiian pizza. He wasn’t a big fan of ham, but he loved pineapple on pizza. He didn’t mind the ham since they were just small cubes.   

He then sat down and decided to settle with water to fill the magic goblet.

CampHalfBloodRP,foluk25,t1_foletxz,1587870822.0,"“We’re most likely going to face other things,” Azrael deadpanned.   

He got a bit more on edge when he noticed the spirits started to follow them. He reminded himself about what one of the other children of Hades told him. They only get power over you if you let them... or something along those lines. Point is, they wouldn’t really be able to bring harm.    

At the faint sound of the river and the change in lighting and torches, Azrael had come to the conclusion that they were near the end. He soon cringed at how loud the river started to get. He stared at the river as a wave of sickness crashed over him. It wasn’t like a physical kind of sickness like a cold. His stomach twisted in the way a stomach does when you’re anxious. He felt such overwhelming guilt and anxiety that it made him feel ill.    

He heard voices screaming at him and accusing him of such horrible things that he never did. He kept repeating in his head that they were lies. It wasn’t true. What if it was though? His mind kept screaming at him to jump in the river. He refused. He tried to keep his mind off all the horrible things the voices were saying about him and telling him. He continued to repeat to himself that he could handle the voices. This wasn’t the first time he had voices insulting him and telling him to jump. He could handle it. It’s nothing new. He just needed to try and ignore them.   

However the accusations and voices weren’t even the worst of it. The worst was all the horrible memories the river was causing him to see and relive. The many memories he had tried to push back and never think about came flooding back. He couldn’t push them back like he usually could. They felt so real. They felt like they were actually happening. He could *see* them happening, one after another.   

His breathing quickened and fearful tears filled his eyes. He found himself desperately reaching out for Mercury’s hand, for *something* to prove that none of the memories were happening.    

He desperately glanced around the area to distract his mind. The river. He remembers writing about the five rivers of the Underworld in one of his English projects. The Acheron River. That’s what the river’s name was. The River of Pain. The barrier between the Underworld and the mortal world. Charon ferried the dead that had their payment along The Acheron to the Underworld. So that must mean the spirit by the shrine of Hades and the boat is most likely Charon. This thought somehow calmed him a bit.      

“The Acheron River...” Azrael shakily stated, his voice sounded weak and faraway, “It leads to the Underworld. The spirit... well you probably can’t see them, but... they’re in front of the shrine on the dock. That spirit is most likely Charon. That’s how we get to the Underworld.”

You begin from the darkness. When you’re in darkness, the shadow hasn’t formed. Yet once you step out of the darkness, a shadow follows you as you are both connected. Therefore, a shadow’s fabric would be the ink of dark night. A shadow is darkness as is night.   
The shadow is bonded to you. It always chases you, yet you always run. It will never be able to catch you.   
The void may also be the earth. The shadow sails the earth, bonded to you. You also sail the earth. The earth is sort of a void. It’s just filled with people that wander around, doing what they are told, never really going anywhere. ~~All around me are familiar faces.~~

“I’m glad to hear that it’s been going good. You definitely deserve things to be going good for you. I’d also be sad if you were to leave. It wouldn’t be the same at all,” Azrael admitted, “Things have been well for me too.”"

“Only once,” Azrael repeated, “Camp is really showing me all the childhood things that I’ve never done or have only done once. It sounds like it must’ve been a lot of fun. Maybe we can do it one time on a date. That is if you’d want to.”   

Azrael looked at at the s’more and a light, warm smile formed on his face.   

“Is that alright?” Azrael asked, “If it is, then yes. I would indeed.”"

Azrael subtly reached out and linked their pinky fingers. He looked at Mercury with a small, shy smile.   
“I love you too,” he whispered.   

He looked at the marshmallow Mercury was roasting and an old memory came to mind, “Y’know, I’ve only roasted marshmallows once in my life. It was at my cousin’s birthday party when I was like seven or something.”"

“If you really want to help then... I feel more calm when you sleep with me... You stop the anxiety attack that usually hits when I wake up during the night. I calm down when I wake up in the middle of the night and see you. You help me fall back asleep right away,” Azrael quietly explained, “You wouldn’t have to sleep over every night. Once a week would be fine. That way I’d have one day with a full eight hours of sleep every week.”"
