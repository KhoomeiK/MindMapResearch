noita,f9cee57,t3_e4k5zl,1575222728.0,"While I agree with some of your points, I personally think it's fun when a rogue-like has a wide dynamic range of how lucky or unlucky you can get in any given run. It adds to the unpredictable nature of Noita in my opinion. The perk and item combos you find may make your run extremely easy, but that combo is unlikely to be found again for the next several runs. When you start a new game there is always the chance of stumbling across another extremely powerful combination of items, or finding nothing good at all in which case the game becomes extremely challenging and causes you to play more cautiously.

Basically, I like how Noita can make players feel like an overpowered witch who is able to defeat or pass enemies without a challenge, while conversely being able to make any grown man clench their buttcheeks and pray to RNGsus for mercy. Although anyone who has played the game knows that even on the most lucky runs, you can still get Noita'd. You are never truly invulnerable in this game. I would not be opposed to making the boss a bit harder though, as it seems to be much more difficult to get to the boss than to beat it in my opinion."
modernwarfare,f8mr8xi,t1_f8mqbsl,1574634172.0,"I agree. If someone finds no enjoyment from playing a game whatsoever, then they should stop playing it.

modernwarfare,f85n01u,t1_f85jpqk,1574278708.0,"Yeah playing against other experienced PC players is usually more fun to me because when you hit a really good shot, they typically recognize you have some skill and aren't just using aimbot. It's always satisfying when my opponents say things like ""nice shot"" or ""that was insane!""...instead of shaming me because they believe I'm toggling aimbot in the middle of a round or some BS.

Unfortunately, the stereotype of PC players being hackers will likely never go away though, unless we figure out a way to stop everyone creating, selling, and using cheats. Even the most advanced anti-cheat can't keep up with them sadly."

They all accused me of having a damage mod that made my bullets deal more damage. Even my own random teammate accused me and said he was turning off crossplay. Some people will always jump to conclusions whenever they see a PC player hit some good shots.

The best part was that they killed me twice and started freaking out thinking they are better than a hacker and telling me how trash I am because I still lose rounds with ""cheats"" lol."

modernwarfare,f6n8vb2,t1_f6n6xkt,1572986776.0,"Yeah, limiting the spawns of tanks would be a good idea. Also, tank kills should not count toward streaks in my opinion. I'm not a fan of how the squad spawn system works either, but I also feel that removing it would make the mode worse.

That 725 nerf can't come soon enough though...it has definitely ruined the smaller maps for me.

When kill confirmed came out, I was excited to play a mode that would get rid of the camping meta for the most part. As it turns out, there is always someone using the 725...and if you don't use it, they will destroy you. Every. Single. Time."
modernwarfare,f6n5tj2,t1_f6n41xx,1572985284.0,"Yeah the tanks need to be nerfed hard or removed in my opinion. Ground war has it's problems, but I play it because people tend to move around more than other modes and it's harder to hear footsteps due to the chaos everywhere.

insurgency,f5loviu,t1_f5lb6nq,1572281334.0,"The reason why you understand where to expect enemies from is most likely because you've played the maps in insurgency more than MW.

When I first played insurgency I had no idea what angles to check or where I was getting shot from. It's the same with MW, but now after 20 hours played I usually know where enemies are and where they are coming from.

MW also gives players a lot more ways to spot enemies than insurgency, and the mini-map is in the game now."

The performance of any game that you play in a browser is dependent on the browser itself.

My computer has never had performance issues while playing this game, and I've seen several people play on shitty laptops without lag or performance issues.

survivio,f2ddul8,t1_f2dbq40,1570151634.0,"It's within the game rules because the game has no rules. The same argument could be used for aimbot because there is no rule against it.

In some cases, teaming can give the player(s) a greater advantage over an aimbot user. It's not very hard to hit your shots in this game anyways.

The ""risk"" of teaming is no different than the risk of not teaming. In solos anyone can be hostile at any time. So when you come across someone and choose to be friendly instead of fight, you are likely just delaying the fight while gaining a temporary advantage. If you help each other kill players, that reduces the amount of threats and risk of dying."

I was in a race on Android Alley and I was basically tied for first place with a very skilled player for almost 2 whole laps. The host left as we were in the middle of a turn, and the player who I was trying to beat (in addition to all the other players) got turned into an AI that kept crashing into a wall for the rest of the race.

I would of liked to see a unique ""champion"" kart for each Grand Prix, awarded exclusively to the top 5% of the champion leaderboard. They could then make the new decals a reward for the top 5% of the nitro leaderboard.

This would require more development time to make an additional kart every Grand Prix though, so I can understand why they went this route."
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,eta777b,t3_cao2zi,1562613751.0,"I use pubg report too and I've seen this same guy get salty and report me on 4 seperate occasions for no apparent reason. I've never been banned though, so I wouldn't worry about it."
crashbandicoot,eta59yf,t1_et9rlpv,1562612507.0,"Please don't be that guy who quits mid-race when they are the host. It disconnects everyone else in the race and forces them to play against easy AI that often crash into walls for the rest of the race. 

You know you are the host when the game assigns you to 1st place during the countdown at the starting line."
crashbandicoot,et9klf2,t1_et9jk0d,1562599171.0,You can also set up an autohotkey script on the computer to press buttons on a standard PS4 controller at certain intervals. People will do anything to see their name on top of a leaderboard.
crashbandicoot,et9j2yt,t3_cal8cl,1562598125.0,"I am about to max out my nitro gauge today, and it's been less than a week since the Grand Prix started. If you can't earn all of the rewards before the month is over, then you must barely play the game and the rewards shouldn't be that important to you."
crashbandicoot,et9ilqb,t1_et9em6k,1562597792.0,"You end up earning nitro at about the same rate offline anyways because the wait between races is as long as the race itself. If you use the 50% boost that everyone can get with nitro boost items, you earn 7 nitro per race offline and 15 per race online. The fastest way to farm nitro is actually in the local arcade with a second controller. That's what the players on top of the nitro leaderboard are doing."
crashbandicoot,et9fi9l,t3_cakpsl,1562595611.0,"The only way I got this to work was to use another controller and do it in split screen. I'm not sure if this was their intention when making the challenge, but it really sucks for those who don't have a second controller lying around."
crashbandicoot,et9emjz,t1_et8ti0g,1562594943.0,"I think it's the best looking kart in the game, but I like lambos so I might be a bit biased. I love the underglow as well, but I kind of wish it changed color based on the paintjob you have equipped."
crashbandicoot,et7xj0s,t1_et7woxc,1562540796.0,"Well, the meme uses the phrase ""make the most out of wumpa time"". The way to make the most out of wumpa time is to play tracks that give the most coins per second and win. Burning through your wumpa time faster by playing longer tracks isn't how you make the most of it; that's how you make the most of your free time if you want to spend more time racing/less time watching loading screens."
crashbandicoot,et7w63z,t1_et7vugx,1562539764.0,"That's true, but the meme implies that Roo's Tubes is a bad choice if you are trying to make the most out of wumpa time...which is incorrect."
crashbandicoot,et7u8uo,t3_ca8d3x,1562538360.0,Agreed. I can't wait to hear what the champion kart sounds like.
