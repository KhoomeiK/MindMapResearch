I don't like how peaches are associated with butts. I don't use emojis. At times they can be confusing just like acronyms. Yesterday, I looked up what BDE meant and I got grossed out.

Since parents are never shown, we don't know if their mother or Marie's father has blue hair. There's a possibility that she could of inherited blue hair from either parent. Or she could have dyed her hair."
ededdneddy,fqrrnyx,t3_gk42ui,1589590454.0,"Interesting poll. I couldn't decide but this is something that I have thought about in the past. Either way could be possible. Like what someone else stated, I like the idea of blue being a natural hair color. If she dyed her hair, I think it would match the character's personality. She kinda has a punk attire even though she doesn't label herself."

No one told me anything about but I was aware of them. When I got my period, my mom and I didn't talk about it. She showed me how to put a pad on and that was it. For years I struggled with period anxiety and was disgusted by it. It was until last year that I ""cured"" myself. I'm ok with my inner female organs but not with the exterior organs. I don't look down there. I know very little about them.

I did experience bullying at school because of my lack of knowledge about my body."

I definitely don't want that happening to me. It also involves looking and touching down there. Not for me. People also talk about TSS when it comes to tampons, too."
