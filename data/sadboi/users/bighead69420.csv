Advice,fmyk3ve,t3_fy6rze,1586488089.0,take deep breaths. I have adhd and my brain moves at the speed of light so trust my i can confirm feeling super rushed and out of control is definitely a sucky feeling. When you take a deep breath it is hard for you to rush because it slows everything down for and distracts your mind with a breath of fresh air. Also when you feel rushed try slowing down by noticing different things around you. anything that can distract you from feeling that rushed feeling. the reason you are not rushing on your work is because your brain is partly distracted with how much online classes suck. see ya
Advice,fmyj9gz,t3_fy6pyr,1586487500.0,"just be yourself. Ik that sounds corny or whatever but honestly shes not gonna give a shit about you if you try to be something that your not. Just flow with it, be yourself, tell her how beautiful she is if you feel like its right.  If she agreed to go through the trouble taking the hours out of her day to virtually date you she prolly has interest in you. AND REMEMBER she has interest in you and not anyone else. Just dont get caught up with yourself and really enjoy it. Soak it all up bro. Theres not code or algorithim for talking to girls dont try to be extra cute or anything, just be genuine."

Tell me, you are in so much fricking pain right now and it feels like it will never stop. But once you kill yourself nothing got better because you just lost everything that actually mattered to you. Everybody who attempts suicide and survives always says that the moment they do it, its immediate regret.

Please dont"

Advice,faf9y45,t3_e8kbka,1576017737.0,"I understand that if you tell them ""please stop its hurting my feelings"" you will probably have more coming your way. My advice is to let them call you that and try not to give too much of a reaction because if you have a reaction they will feed off of that and continue to do it. Trust me, this whole thing will probably blow over in however much time. I mean think about it, even if you see someone you knew from school in a few years they are probably not gonna say ""hey whats up micro penis"". Kids just like to give short bursts of these kind of things and then they will realize that you dont care and stop for the most part."

I really wasn't expecting people who actually spent time on my post and this honestly made me feel way better.

Yes I have a lot of friends and yes they tease me, but i know thats just how kids can be sometimes.

I do play a lot of sports, the season im in right now is .... of course.... basketball

The sport that requires a ton of height- but i still enjoy the game i think it helps a lot to be focused on stuff like that."
