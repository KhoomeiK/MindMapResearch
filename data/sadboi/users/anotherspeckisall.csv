Back to what OP said, then. If s/he was barely getting by with a part-time job, how the hell are people who weren't in the military able to afford inflated college costs?

And no, you're not getting ""paid"" to go to school. You earned that; you PAID into that benefit with your blood, sweat, and tears during service. A lot of veterans literally paid with flesh and health points to be a cog in the machine.

A very generous and simplified calculation based on a E-5/6 years veteran with dependents:

E-5 base ([27,338/yr](https://www.federalpay.org/military/navy/petty-officer-second-class) x 6 years) + (HI BAH&COLA = 27,168 x 3y) + (VA BAH = 18,108 x 3y) = $299,856 or 49,976 per year

GI Benefits in WA for 3 years will total $70,635.

Now, if that person was in cybersecurity, which earns base 75k/yr in Seattle. Your total work experience + GI Benefit is laughable.

They are RETROACTIVELY paying you way lesser than what your market value is. That is a bitter pill to swallow.

If you're a veteran and life worked out for you after getting out, great! Good for you! I am rooting for you. However, the sad reality is, not everyone turned out fine after getting out. It's a painful experience to heal and go back to normalcy. A lot were conditioned to believe that you don't deserve more when you absolutely do. :( And no amount of other people had it worse makes up for that.

COA's are just ***estimates***.

Here are a few samples of COA (room and board/mo) in Seattle area:*(note: these don't include tuition)*

* Seattle Central - 14,986 (1174.22/mo)
* SeattleU - 18,156 (1392.33/mo)
* UW-Seattle - 16,431 (1422/mo)

**Avg of $1329.52/mo** for room and board

BAH/MHA for Seattle: $2,505/mo (this was recently reduced from 2600/mo)... $1329.52 is 53% of housing allowance already! How you manage your expenses on that allowance for 9 months with dependents is beyond me. Oh, I forgot to say, you don't get allowance for the 3 months you're not in school. Yey!

As for moving states, that is costly as fuck without military-sponsored PCS. LOL! Sure, I can haul my ass to Montana, but can I easily do that with existing debt plus dependents? I understand going out of your home state for schooling to alleviate costs, but hurrah for adjusted MHA when you move to those lower-cost of living places. Moving expenses are not included in student loan calculation (something the feds removed some time ago), therefore it's also not included in your Post-9/11 benefits.

The GI Bill doesn't 100% put veterans at an advantage. And I'm just going to throw it out there that we haven't even started adding the possibility of your mental health as a veteran being shit and thus alienating you from the rest of the school population. But you have to keep going anyway and just take the fail in your classes because if you drop, you WILL OWE the VA. Yipee!

politics,evczd8l,t1_evcxyap,1564426662.0,"Well, you do sound callous. :)

The assumption most people have is that a LOT of people go into debt for willy-nilly things. But in reality, a lot of people do go in to debt for the most basic of things - veteran or civilian - because that's just the way the American system is set up.

Another thing to point out is that state schools are more competitive than others. For example, computer science/engineering programs will be more competitive to get into at UW-Seattle than SeattleU. Not everybody can get into a state school, and that's just part of the limitation that your callousness kinda ignores.

So, if you are already in debt (e.g. car payments, credit card loans) and try going back to school, the allowance still don't cover those which is fair but also could be very limiting to a lot of students. 

A majority of people in the US have debt as that is how the system is set up.

How are they gonna get by on a student budget with those OTHER costs outside of matriculation? But that's a whole other can of worms. :s"

politics,evcqnqy,t1_evce49y,1564421129.0,"To add to OP's comment, the GI Bill only covers the in-state tuition and adjusted cost of living allowance based on your zip code. If you're going into a private institution that is typically more expensive than state schools, you'd still have to take out some loans to cover the rest of the tuition. There are some private schools that do have the Yellow Ribbon program, but even then, it may not be enough as slots are limited to a certain number of veteran students.

There are also people I know who joined the military thinking that their college loan debt will be forgiven. Guess what? A lot of those people weren't even clear on what loans were eligible (note: only federal loans are forgivable, not private/bank loans). So, now, they are stuck in the military because it's stable pay with their loans still looming over their shoulder even after 10 years of service.

Lastly, a 2-year IT program in central Canada is about 16k CAD for 2 years for tuition. That's not even a year of tuition in most schools in the US. That's how inflated tuition costs are in the US. Sure you can get scholarships, but why should students HAVE to rely on the ""generosity"" of the private sector?

1. Pick my battles - if he hasn't done something that was asked of or expected of him, I wait a couple days before reminding him. He's already anxious about seeing a bunch of stuff piled up for him to do; he doesn't need me to add to that.
2. Remind, follow up, offer - Remind him of appointments/commitments. We have a shared calendar that helps with this. If I suspect he hasn't paid attention to something, I follow up. If it's pressing and really needs to be dealt with, I offer to help him start the task or trade tasks with him.
3. Don't take things personally - This bit is the HARDEST to do. I also have issues with mental health, and so when I have bouts of down moments, I tend to take things personally. But, when I am better and there was something he said or done that he apologizes for, I tell him ""Thank you for considering my feelings; I didn't take it personally, but I appreciate your acknowledgement that you said something not nice."" He really appreciates it when I verbalize to him that I am not taking something personally, that way he also takes a moment to be kind to himself.

It really sucks. It never gets easy. Take care of yourself, OP. Caregiver fatigue is real. You cannot take care of him if you don't give yourself enough room for self-care.

You got this!"
Marriage,eojf49a,t1_eoje3u1,1558637042.0,"Not so much anymore. I have kinda grown out of PC-gaming. The game we played ruined every other MMO for me, but they have closed so :( We had one very close friend we played with, but he passed away 2 years ago. We are ""friends"" on social media with some of our guildmates, but the interactions are rare these days.

We do co-op games on the PS4 when we find a nice one. We have pretty good teamwork ;)"
Marriage,eoj0nts,t3_bs41xd,1558631120.0,"I met my spouse when I was 19 in an online game. We became close friends and started ""dating"" a year later. It wasn't until I was 22 when we finally met face to face for the first time. I picked him up at the airport when he visited my city. 

We did the whole LDR thing for 6 years before getting married and moving in together. We've been married now for almost 5 years. :)

It's not a perfect marriage, but I'm happy to have grown old and more mature with my best friend."
