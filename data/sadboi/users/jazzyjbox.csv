I've been in several abusive relationships over the years. I wish I could say the pain disappears, but it does dissipate with work and time. The best thing you can do is stop expecting yourself to be at certain stages while you're healing. Every journey is different, and there are setbacks that will probably happen. So long as you accept that it's a possibility and don't shame yourself for it, you'll be that much closer.

You can do this. You don't have to be perfect. Your anxiety is lying to you. ðŸ’œ"

Boys are so...intense. But the melatonin would definitely help - we have issues with them going to sleep too. (Everything feels like a battle in some fashion.) 

I am all for them being outside when it's safe. I just keep hoping it will get easier as they get older, but it just seems to be getting harder. :/"
Parenting,fb2ii5c,t1_fb29o3p,1576451667.0,"Mother. 

We're on the same page about the rules, and we have very rarely accidentally overridden what the other has said. We're both exhausted from trying to handle these kids. And this is when the kids are in school/daycare. I don't have any idea how I'm going to survive as a stay-at-home mom when I transition out of the service in a few months. ðŸ˜ž"
Parenting,fb2hnyf,t1_fb283z2,1576451227.0,"We do try to make sure the kids get a little bit of individual attention each week (as often as we can). 

The 3yo isn't expected to dress himself, but, ironically, he's the only one who makes any effort to try by pulling out his clothes when he wakes up. The 5 and 7yos just need to get dressed and go open the back door. Is that actually too much for a morning?? 

It's all the more frustrating with the 7yo who knows this and actually was in the routine of it for several weeks going back to sneaking food and tablets or the Switch. Or waking up his brothers to play instead of get ready for school. 

They only play Paw Patrol or Candy Crush and watch Disney Jr cartoons, so it's not the content I'm upset about but the total disregard. They do it about the small and the big stuff. 

Told them to stay off the deck because we're replacing the rotted parts, showed them the holes in the deck and how dangerous it can be. Went upstairs to swap laundry, and they went outside to the deck. Nothing gets through to them. ðŸ˜£"
Parenting,fb2f7um,t1_fb27c1s,1576449958.0,"I mean, it's ""reading time"", but that's for the oldest who can read. The 5 yo does his workbook, and the 3yo colors. 

They don't have many chores. Put clothes away if there are any out, clean up toys, and help with the dishes. I don't expect it to be perfect or even great. If their toys are thrown in the bin haphazardly, it doesn't matter. If the dishes are stacked on the counter instead of put in the cupboard, that's fine."
Parenting,fb2e91p,t1_fb26wlc,1576449457.0,"Noise cancelling headphones are definitely on my wish list. The only way I've sanely been able to grocery shop with the kids is when I have headphones in one of my ears. 

I'd love to take away electronics. I've put the oldest on ""restriction"" before where he only had music. But that just led to more of him sneaking and lying."
rapecounseling,f7ppa9k,t1_f7pnxnv,1573952556.0,"I've been there and had people not believe me for years, and it hurts. But you just keep on with YOUR truth, and you'll be able to weed out the ones you can trust in the future. Brene Brown has some good YouTube videos on guilt, shame, and trust that may help also. One of the books I'm currently using is Dialectical Behavior Therapy for PTSD as well as doing some Cognitive Processing Therapy. Insurance IS a nightmare! But there are resources out there for free or in books that can at least get you on the path for healing. 

I hope your parents are there for you and maybe a friend or two, but find the support wherever you can get it in healthy forms. Even online. You will get through this because you're strong. You survived it. You'll learn to thrive again. I wish you all the best on your journey! ðŸ’œðŸ’™"
rapecounseling,f7pmkrj,t3_dwp00l,1573951457.0,"I felt this so much for you. A similar kind of situation happened to me at about the same age. It's been 15 years, and I'm still working on healing from it. But one of the first steps is what you just did there, talk about it. Even though it's hard, so unbelievably hard, you did it. And that's something to be proud of and hopefully you have a tiny bit of relief from putting it out there. 

If you can, see about getting a PTSD workbook if you aren't ready to seek therapy. They have plenty on Amazon that can help you work through some of these things, though it does NOT take the place of actual therapy. 

Please keep this in mind if you ever come across resistance for getting help: I believe and support you. And it's not your fault. ðŸ’œðŸ’œ Take care of yourself."

Maybe you two could try couple's counseling? Not because there's something wrong with your marriage, but it could help to have someone to provide insight in how to move forward again. 
Sometimes it hits us again later, that's why it's trauma. But it's okay. It doesn't mean you're broken or that it's always going to be that way, even if it feels like it right now. You can find a way through this blockade and enjoy being with your husband again."
ptsd,f38qfqj,t3_dfxido,1570738882.0,"Still on active duty pending medical retirement. However, never deployed. Mine stems from several repeated traumatic incidents, both sexual and secondary combative. I came to realize that my issues were PTSD only a couple months ago, and I'm still working on getting it documented by doctors because, for VA and military, the diagnosis has to be focused around one activating event. 

I dismissed the idea of having PTSD for so long because I had never deployed. I had been told for years my situation ""wasn't that bad"" and I ""needed to get out of my head"" and that's what I believed. But the general public doesn't understand that PTSD can come from a variety of activating incidents, from childhood abuse to car wrecks to war zones and anything beyond or between. 

If you're a vet who's never deployed and the symptoms of PTSD resound with you, you could still have it! If you're a civilian who has never been in a war zone, you could still have it! Don't let anyone else keep you from speaking your truth!"

Speak your truth. If the things in these forums resonate with you, it's striking a chord of truth. Everyone's story is different. Everyone's threshold is different. If your symptoms are interfering with your life, get help. If you're afraid of it getting worse but can currently function, get help.

Don't be ashamed of your truth. You aren't alone. And you are strong."

I want to not be paranoid about people but also able to stand my ground, even on the small things. I find myself compromising all the time or preferring to submit to someone else's will because it's easier. I don't seem to know where to start with small stuff, let alone the bigger ones."

Insurance is a huge consideration that I haven't had to make in a while. 

It's okay to take those things into account. Maybe offer to work a few hours on an off day or something to make up for time needed away. Or negotiate pay for better insurance plans if you can afford to do so. These are some of the things I've been thinking about too."
