Your mom might not have depression, maybe she loves her life, maybe her presence in this world has a significant value or meaning and you being depressed isn’t a reason to take that away. The school shooters also used depression to mass murder. And this kind of “depressed “ people ruin it for everyone else. You have more issues along with depression, the issue of being selfish and narcissistic. Most people suffering from depression are so mellow and broken, they would never wish this pain or any other type of pain on anyone else , not even their worst enemy. Let alone their own mother.

Don’t be in the “friend zone “ if you want her to come back to you and specifically to you once she is confident and is ready to allow herself to love again. I had a friend like you who was waiting but he left but he still comes around whenever he sees me at work or school and I know once I start dating again he will be back or maybe he won’t but if he does, one thing for sure , I will never date him because now he is in the toxic men basket for me.

Give yourself a vacation, turn off your devices, go off the radar and just enjoy a cocktail by the sunset maybe. Fix a routine for yourself, get yourself expensive PT or dieticians and personal chef. Work on yourself instead of pointing fingers and putting the blame on other things. Or save up money, invest in real estate and quit. Retire early and just chill. Or get a career coach. You have plenty of money, in this materialistic world there is no service or help you can’t afford. Get yourself the help you need. First step, maybe find a good therapist."

personalfinance,f4phu2z,t3_dlbhfz,1571731398.0,DO NOT SEND IT BACK. Just leave it there. If you don’t spend it then technically you did not steal even if the transaction was real. Wait for the sender to deal with their “mistake” . You do nothing in this regard.

depression,f3wksj3,t3_didf45,1571206738.0,"I was on your boat just a few months ago. I was struggling for 6 years before I decided to finally seek help. I’ve been on medication for a year and it has made a drastic difference in my life.  Also I attend counselling every once in a while. I am doing so much better now, almost back to my old self. But still gotta keep pushing though. One thing I’ve realised is , FIX your mental health and your entire life will fall into place by itself. Seek help and Good luck."
ITCareerQuestions,f3wjn58,t3_dijzh3,1571205231.0,This is so wholesome. I work at a supermarket! I’m currently on the boat where I read these success stories and think it all sounds like a dream that it can happen for me too. But congratulations!! This is amazing!
