BipolarReddit,f9un180,t3_e6ymbz,1575654085.0,"I know where you’re coming from. I often feel like I don’t even relate to other people with my condition, but as people with bipolar disorder I want everyone to succeed. It’s difficult being in and out of hospitals and therapy especially when you don’t have many people close to you. If you wanna vent please message me."

MadeOfStyrofoam,ey6fghu,t1_ey65yym,1566854357.0,I just filled out the sheets everyday saying I felt happy even though I had just tried to die. If I didn’t I would’ve been held there so much longer. It’s such a joke.

antidepressants,ew5r5v2,t1_ew5qvug,1565143052.0,Idk I’d check in with a psychiatrist about that and see how to fix your libido.
antidepressants,ew5r06c,t1_ew5pud7,1565142944.0,Wish someone would have told me that. Anytime I up the dose I get tremors
antidepressants,ew5oc05,t3_cmyt78,1565141117.0,Welbutrin hasn’t ever killed my libido in my experience. I take multi vitamins with it just because it really kills my appetite and I can’t fit all the nutrients I need in a day with it.
