The Tea:

""I (48 M) used to date this girl in 2015, she was much younger than me (21 years my junior). It ended in the fall, rather amicably but I was glad to be done and have moved on, and I assume she has too.

Fast Forward to this year and I am selling some real estate. I have an agent approach me to discuss the property, I have met this guy before but don't know him very well.

We meet and discuss my property, and he explains that he has married said girl. I didn't react in any way positive or negative. He asked me if we had dated before and I said yes, and he commented ""Yea, because she told me ALL about you"". I asked what he meant and he was just chuckling about it. Again I persisted, ""What did she tell you about me?"". He said nothing, don't worry about it. So yes, I'm visibly upset and end the meeting and walk out.

2 weeks later I get an e-mail from him discussing the property etc. At the end he writes:

""Also, GIRL says hello... :-) LOL""

I responded telling him I'm not interested in his proposal, however here are some pictures when I was there before you and for the record I broke up with her. And I attached two nudes she had sent me was back when.

Needless to say, he is furious however in my opinion he started it. There is no reason to belittle me, it's fine that you married her but don't blame me for having my pride and wondering what he was snickering about. So AITA?""

&#x200B;

""If she is still complaining about it, get ready for this to happen the rest of your life. She is acting like you told her to ""Shut the fuck up"" or something, and if something this minor is something she can't get over, you have to consider what happens when something major happens.

I had a GF (later became my wife, later became my ex-wife) that would dredge things up from 6,7 or even 8 years in the past of when I supposedly dissed her in some way. You can be sure that this will NEVER be forgotten and you will be hearing about this for the next 10+ years.

And really, is it that sexist? As I read previously, why did she need the all powerful man to get her the menu? Yes I know she didn't speak French but she didn't have a phone and could type into a translation program what she wanted?

When everyone is sexist then no one is sexist...""

I'm sure there are plenty articles online that can articulate it better than I can. I was trying to be as delicate as possible but suffice it to say a straight woman will never have to discuss the boundaries of what she is allowed to do sexually with other women with her partner. Also, two straight people will never have to figure out the dynamics of fitting in to the LGBTQ+ community. A straight man and woman will never be in the situation where someone is feeling unwelcome in their own community and like their identity is being erased because of who they love. Yes, every relationship has it's own dynamics but my point is two straight opposite sex people will not have the same experiences as a straight person and a bisexual person or two bisexual people being in a relationship."

Couples where one or both people are bisexual may have the boundary that you are allowed to be intimate with people of the same sex but not the opposite sex.

One of the things these stress chemicals do is mess with your digestive system so unless you are regulating your stress chemicals somehow (with medication or the like) it will continue to wreak havoc even when you are feeling calm. The good thing is that once you start regulating these chemicals manually (since the brain can't do it automatically) the brain begins to rewire itself and release less stress chemicals less frequently.
