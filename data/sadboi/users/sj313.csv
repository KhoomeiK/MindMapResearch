My skin that is unexposed to the sun is flawless and looks like it hasn't aged since my childhood. The skin everywhere else which has been exposed to the sun looks significantly more aged. So I do believe it does contribute to aging. You can consume a lot of dietary vitamin D on carnivore. I always end up getting a high amount of it on my diet. Plus you can expose your skin to the sun briefly if you're concerned, or at least just wear sunscreen on your face and neck (the main areas where you want to prevent aging)."
zerocarb,fpqxjpb,t1_fpecnw1,1588835293.0,"I believe the other component to aging is caused by consuming sugar or any carbs, which damages the skin in many ways such as through glycation as well as due to high insulin levels damaging the skin, as it damages all organs.

My skin was damaged and aged just from literally a couple of occasions of mild tanning as a teenager following a vegetarian diet. My skin shouldn't have gotten damaged from that especially at such a young age which I believe occurred due to my diet. I have found a good tinted moisturizer that has a mineral based sunscreen in it and works well, but that won't work for covering other areas such as my skin and neck or if I don't want to wear makeup."

Exactly. I think that aging due to sun exposure is caused by inadequate nutrients/consuming too many inflammatory foods, which do not allow the body to adequately protect itself and repair it's skin from sun exposure. I also have avoided using chemical sunscreen for the same concerns you've had but I have started to use sunscreen fairly often just in case to prevent any aging that could possibly occur due to sun exposure especially since my diet hasn't been perfect. I have also used antiaging creams/serums but I feel that they are very inadequate compared to the effects of consuming a nutrient dense diet, and especially compared to the results you got from consuming heavy cream!"

I am a 26 female and I do not have any wrinkles but it looks like I may be *starting* to develop laugh lines which I have been particularly fixated on as well lol. In certain lightings it shows an indentation, but there's no lines yet. So I would love to be able to reverse that and prevent actual lines from developing. I feel that the main cause of aging is consuming sugar so I am trying to eliminate it long term as a lifestyle. I definitely believe that consuming adequate dietary fat is very important for skin so it makes sense to me that consuming a high amount of heavy whipping cream would reverse your signs of aging. I am so excited about your revelation and I plan to try it myself! Could use the extra calories anyway as I have been rapidly losing weight and I was already thin to begin with."

I always failed to stick to it because I felt restricted and wanted to enjoy life and consume sugar and what not, but I have gotten to the point where my quality of life was suffering too much and it just wasn't worth it so I've decided to make it a lifestyle. I have had a long history of mental health issues and I have personally determined a TON of different factors that contributed to my mental health issues. So this is what I have found that needs to be addressed for optimal mental health. These are the main factors which needed to be addressed for me: 

1. The most important factor is eliminating inflammatory foods: Sugar, grains, gluten, and vegetable oils.
2. Caffeine adversely affects my mental health
3. Proper omega 3:6 ratio. Too much omega 6 (such as from consuming vegetable oils, anything high in omega 6 such as peanuts or cashews) causes mood issues as well as inflames my skin. So high omega 6 is very inflammatory and the mood/skin issues induced by it are solely due to inflammation. 
4. Proper nutrition. Consuming beef and salmon GREATLY improves my mood. 
5. It seems that being in a state of ketosis is an important factor for my physical and mental health.  
6. Cardiovascular exercise. 
7. Minerals such as magnesium. Most people are pretty deficient in may minerals."

depressionregimens,fl1s0a3,t3_flzfmr,1584735088.0,"Yes they do. I felt normal for the first time in my life on a ketogenic diet. There's a variety of reasons why this occurs. Grains are very inflammatory and I believe that's one of the main causes of depression - inflammation. They also caused blood sugar dysregulation which can directly impact your mood and cause mood swings. Ketogenic diet has a mood stabilizing effect as well by reducing intracellular sodium, which mimics the effect of mood stabilizing medication. Carbs causing mood issues can also come down to food sensitivities as well which induce mood issues. The best I felt in my life I did a dairy free ketogenic diet (not sure if eliminating diary is what improved my mood but I do have a mild allergy to it, so inflammation due to consuming allergens could have been adversely affecting my mood), caffeine free (caffeine from coffee, energy drinks and other processed sources of caffeine pretty much induce a mental disorder for me), yoga and cardiovascular exercise in particular all collectively benefitted my mood immensely and I felt the best I had ever felt in my life.

Also have you looked into the carnivore diet? That seems to be the diet that helps improve mental health more than anything. Vegetables can still be inflammatory and problematic for many people. It works so well to improve mental health issues as well as virtually every other health issue because it is the ultimate elimination diet. So that would probably be helpful for you as you are unsure of what foods impact your mood. Check out the carnivore and zero carb groups here on reddit. Lots of great testimonials."
decaf,fl1r4mz,t1_fl1bnp6,1584734571.0,I have experienced these effects from caffeine as well.
decaf,fl1r1l8,t3_flyrnf,1584734523.0,"Yes it definitely can. Caffeine (other than caffeine in tea) pretty much induces a mental disorder for me. It pretty much causes me to have a full blown anxiety disorder. I feel that a lot of the fear and paranoia from the corona virus is very well due to everyone being chronically over caffeinated, and everyone is so disconnected from their bodies that they believe that this is just a ""normal"" response but in reality it is just due to their physiology due to having stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline) pumping through their body which is causing everyone to be hysterical. I am perfectly calm and not fazed what so ever by the corona virus. But in general caffeine will cause me to have such bad anxiety/mental health issues that it is literally debilitating and going off of caffeine is a night and day difference. The mental health issues are pretty much solely induced by the caffeine. If you have issues with anxiety caffeine is definitely not going to be good for you. I could very well be induced solely by the caffeine as it is for me. I would recommend replacing it with yerba mate to wean off of it. The effect caffeine elicits from tea is completely different than coffee or energy drinks. The other beneficial compounds in tea help to negate any adverse effects of the caffeine, plus it contains a smaller quantity of caffeine anyway. I feel that yerba mate is far better for depression. For me personally, caffeine from coffee, energy drinks and other sources of processed caffeine also induced depression. So maybe you feel that coffee is helps your depression when in reality it is exasperating your depressive symptoms, and could be the cause of them in the first place."
decaf,fl1pc41,t1_fl0qgkt,1584733541.0,"Yes, cacao powder can have that effect for some individuals, especially if you have a Pitta dominant constitution according to Ayurveda, and anyone who is Pitta dominant should avoid ""heating"" foods which increase Pitta qualities, and agitation would be one of them. If you are not familiar with Ayurveda it may be worth looking into. I am kapha/vata dominant, so in my case foods that increase Pitta are not a problem since it is not dominant in my constitution, and it can actually help to address an imbalance of being too dominant in kapha/vata. So if you are pitta dominant coffee and black tea are definitely not good for you since they are too heating and will cause agitation. Yerba mate and green tea would definitely be a more suitable choice for you. And yes, that's exactly why processed carbs and sugar are problematic because they are refined from their whole food form and cause a whole host of issues in the body - increase dopamine too much leading to addiction, causes blood sugar levels to be unnaturally high, etc. but this type of effect does not occur when consuming sugar in it's whole food form, such as with fruit because the fiber and nutrients it contains helps to negate the detrimental effects of sugar. But processed carbs literally are nothing but sugar, no fiber, no nutrients. So when you consume an isolated substance like that, that's when you are asking for problems. So as I mentioned in my post, that is why processed/isolated forms of caffeine elicit a completely different effect than caffeine you consume from tea. For me the difference between consuming tea and energy drinks is like night and day. Processed caffeine does seem to have a drug like effect on me and pretty much induces a mental disorder/psychosis. I feel no adverse effects from tea and I can remain perfectly calm while consuming tea and it does not induce a mental disorder lol."

As I discussed in my post, this is what you should do to address lack of energy/motivation: 1) Cardiovascular exercise, preferably first thing in the morning would help you the most with the lack of energy and motivation. 2) Use Yerba mate tea to taper off of caffeine. It has a stimulating effect without the adverse side effects of caffeine in coffee/processed sources of caffeine. 3) Take minerals (trace minerals, magnesium, sodium, selenium) and a vitamin B supplement. So go back and read these parts of my post for more information as to why these methods help to increase motivation, improve energy levels and combat withdrawal symptoms.

I can relate to that since I'm 26 and feel pressure to move out but I'm not going to for quite some time because of school because for the master's degree I am getting you are unable to work and must live off of student loans so I want to live at home to minimize my debt which I feel is smart so I don't care about societal norms but at times I do feel pressured to move on and get my own place and everything.
