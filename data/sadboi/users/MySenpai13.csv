She pulled a full 180 when I went through my first major depressive episode and became my main mode of disassociation. My parame used to be a marysue, just a regular kids imagination, now she's very developed. She went through a lot of trauma. Her mother died, she was sexually harassed and abused constantly, she's used by most people, depressed and terribly damaged. She has a few strong sides but also many flaws. Every single event she went through can somewhat be linked to an event in my life in a metaphorical way. Also, I'm a writer so at least the maladaptive daydreaming helps in that way..."

My paras are like my children and my parame is somewhat an escape from the world if I'm struggling or even just bored. If I were to stop maladaptive daydreaming my life would be boring and probably meaningless. My fictional world is what I live for and what I live in and it is more real and true to me than reality could ever get."
