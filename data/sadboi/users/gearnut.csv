I can't change what has happened to me, the most I can do is to make a detailed report to the police such that if he is caught abusing someone else he will be unable to harm them and to submit a detailed complaint to Social Services requesting confirmation that their processes have been updated in such a fashion that those failures will not be able to affect other children in future.

In response to your question:

This is absolutely, totally normal with trauma. So, congratulations your brain has responded in a predictable way to a traumatic event, if you're experiencing feelings of being a mess/ screwed up/ isolated/ different/ downright weird you don't need to worry, your brain has done what it is meant to do and protected you from dealing with a situation which was uncomprehendable at the time it took place. The feelings for me were scary (physical/ emotional and some kind of sexual stuff) and I felt all of those things about myself for a long time, partly because I thought PTSD was something only soldiers got, not little kids who've been repeatedly attacked so I didn't seek treatment I just tried to tough it out. It's been a longish road for me to figure out how to address the issues and I have done so in fits and starts but I feel generally pretty happy with my life these days. Dealing with trauma sucks, BUT treatment of PTSD and understanding of comorbidities etc has increased dramatically in the last 20 years, there are some great counsellors out there, you've found a helpful community of people and there are loads of helpful resources to support your recovery.

Loads of people with trauma dissociate from the memory. This is where the brain basically says it can't process the memory so it puts it on top of a figurative book case for safe keeping/ out of sight so it can forget then X years later stressful events come along, they cause the bookcase to fall over and the memory of the trauma reappears with no warning with the person having never emotionally processed what had happened and wondering where the heck this memory's come from as it's appeared from nowhere and there's no context to when it took place relative to other emories other than the location.

I have found the following resources useful in my own recovery:

engineering,fqi0lvn,t1_fqhqzmr,1589387793.0,"I think it depends on what the engineering service is and what competencies are required to be confident the safety won't be compromised, I have a background in the functional safety of rail vehicles (passenger and maintenance machines). If you allowed me to go and add an additional radio system to the cab you'd probably wind up with a load of horrible EMC issues. If you asked me to justify deferring a time based overhaul of a brake actuator on the basis that a machine has been used less than expected (but been in regular operation) you would get a detailed report explaining issues which may arise from such a deferral and how to appropriately mitigate them while also detailing the factors of the situation which support the defferal of an overhaul, if it's not safe to do you'd get an explanation of why it's not safe. Would you want me, with a BEng and an MSc in Mechanical Engineering, doing maintenance tasks to meet the requirements of those mitigations? Nope, but one of my colleagues who could equally have written the same report to the same standard of quality as me could very well do that.

Working as a standards compliance engineer if I found myself wrestling with an inadequate compliance argument I would imagine that I was sat in a court with a judge asking me to justify my decision to sign off part of the design onb the basis that it was compliant. If I felt that I would be embarassed by my rationale I would return the submission detailing what areas of the clause hadn't been adequately addressed. If I felt that I would be comfortable I would write the same explanation of why I believed it to be compliant as I would provide to the judge.
Why did I do this? Because a colleague who acted as one of my employer's signatories wound up standing in front of a judge to do just that. I'm not a chartered engineer yet so couldn't act as a signatory myself (the requirements are more significant than just needing someone to be chartered), but I certainly wouldn't think of putting someone in the position where they had to stand there and justify why they signed off a machine on the basis  of flimsy evidence.
Professional negligence is a thing in the UK and some engineers take it very seriously. Thankfully it's not possible for those services to be provided by anyone without a UKAS accredited verification process."

The experience based route seems to take a lot longer to reach chartership than mixed degree and experience, however on the flipside most people with a degree entering into graduate schemes are encouraged to work directly toward CEng (which leads to lots of companies requiring an MEng or MSc just to get onto the graduate scheme).

It sounds like two random guys accidentally walked into an underage house party, one of them heard you being raped, stopped it and then his mate panicked and asked for them to leave.
They were probably young adults at the time (i.e. Sub 21 as you have surmised) given that they were immature enough to wander into a random house party and the panic about being falsely held responsible.

I would recommend writing down your recollection of events and the impact which they have had on you prior to being interviewed by the police, the interview process can be distressing which can lead to the events being improperly recorded (this happened with my own report of abuse, I recently got a file from social services detailing my contact with Social Services)."

The way in which trauma occurs means that things are connected up differently within our heads after the event, this is why we can't just ""get over it"" and why we have unexpected hallucinatory or emotional flashbacks/ nightmares/ day mares as you have called them.

You're not bad for feeling scared, any healthy person experiencing significant trauma would wind up being scared of things they associated with a traumatic situation.

I found that issues around self worth and self compassion undermined ALL of my relationships, romantic, platonic and professional. It's a cruel consequence of abuse that without treatment we tend to subconsciously seek out relationships similar to those which traumatised us.

Abuse survivors pick up a lot of maladaptive behaviours as a means of surviving their abuse/ ptsd/ depression, when the abuse is over these lead to emotional unavailability or controlling behaviours and when they lose control they revert back to what they were taught was an appropriate response to bring challenged (violence, manipulation, imprisonment).

There is no issue with your mum using some of the money from your scholarship to cover the costs of you living with her (if it's cheaper to stay at home than renting somewhere in halls or with coursemates after accounting for rent, insurance, bills, taxes and food then I don't see any issue with her asking you for money, if it costs more than that lot then you are financially independent and can leave).

I don't think you owe your stepfather or your mum anything (your mum chose to have a child and is responsible for that decision up to the point where you are able to be independent of her).
