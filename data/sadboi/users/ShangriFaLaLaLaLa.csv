Tacoma,fohlvgp,t1_fogze0f,1587768128.0,That may be true but knowing people who have been getting paid for the last 3 weeks and he's been waiting for 6 just doesn't add up.

It's feeling really good and then wondering why. It's guilt, reluctance, self loathing, and hoping someone gets it. It's being alone in a crowded room and not being able to say a word that makes sense to anyone."
