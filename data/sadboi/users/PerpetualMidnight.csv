I am sorry your significant other is being invalidating. Unfortunately this is something a lot of us deal with even in our most intimate relationships. People won't understand what they refuse to, and don't know what they don't know.

I was misdiagnosed with depression for years, and looking back on it I was having some hypomania, it was just rare and mild. I didn't realize what I was experiencing, so I never talked about it. My only indication at that time was I couldn't take SSRIs, I had a severe reaction to them. However I have taken other antidepressants by themselves without a problem. Eventually it got worse and I had an actual manic episode, which led to my BP1 diagnosis. Before that I probably would have been considered BP2 if I had realized I was experiencing hypomania. Sometimes my only symptom is I can't sleep but still have energy, other times I get racing thoughts, hypersexuality, inability to sleep, grandiosity, etc. But mine definitely got worse over time because I wasn't being treated for it. I don't blame the doctors; there was no real indication I was bipolar when I first developed depressive symptoms.

Long story short, it's good you have a medication that is working that covers all your bases. Since bipolar typically becomes worse without treatment, you can nip it in the bud before it becomes way worse like mine did before I was diagnosed."

Bipolar individuals cycle through moods, and while those episodes can be triggered by extreme stress or a traumatizing event, they often occur for little to no reason or trigger, and they last for at least a week (mania) or two weeks (depression).

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by several mood swings in a day, in response to things that happen externally. This can include small things like being told ""No"". Your fear of ""setting him off"" raises red flags for me that he might have borderline. ""Walking on eggshells"" is another phrase commonly associated with BPD.

You can't set off someone with bipolar.

But cut contact with this guy completely. He is abusive and dangerous.

I am here if you need to talk."
bipolar,erv51g1,t3_c4687n,1561306598.0,"I feel you. I get told I am pretty all the time. One of my psychologists told me I am a ""natural beauty"".

Great, now what? No matter how many times you tell me how pretty I am, it's not going to cure my debilitating brain disease.

Plus, I am not going to believe it when I am depressed.

I agree with you, it's invalidating. Add ""but you're so smart"" to the list. And? I'm smart and also very sick. I need you to acknowledge that.

Also, you don't come across as egocentric. Don't worry about it."
bipolar,erv4hcs,t3_c46ee6,1561306157.0,"I miss aspects of it, like the unchecked confidence. But I nearly ruined my life my last manic episode. My credit is ruined, and it was actually really good up until that point.

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I feel like it shows how dangerous mania is. I actually got an STD. Fortunately, it was one of the curable ones.

Nothing more embarrassing then going in for a possible UTI and having the doctor tell you you have chlamydia. And being lectured about unsafe sex practices with practical strangers.

So, yeah, I will miss aspects from it. But I never want to be put in that position again. It could turn out far worse."
bipolar,erv3pz6,t3_c46dir,1561305556.0,"I did TMS. My psychiatrist switched my diagnosis to MDD as, like you said, it's not indicated for bipolar (so the insurance would cover it). It really helped my depression. It's uncomfortable at first, but your head gets used to the constant tapping. They try to do as close to 40 sessions as possible, if your insurance will cover it.

It didn't trigger mania for me, but everyone is different. I messed it up by deciding I didn't need meds anymore and went off cold turkey. So don't do that ;)"
bipolar,erv38eo,t3_c3vdeq,1561305166.0,"Unfortunately, they don't have anything in my area. I would really like to be in a bipolar support group.

My therapist wants me to go back to PHP, which will probably be a DBT based group.

Don't get me wrong; I love me some DBT. I just want to be in a group with my bipolar peeps. They get me, you know?"
bipolar,ertnb5x,t3_c3w903,1561247404.0,Congratulations! You will rock this next phase of your life.
bipolar,ertn7zr,t3_c3w7zk,1561247330.0,"Doesn't sound like it to me. Mixed episodes cycle, just like depressive or manic episodes. They last way longer than five minutes, usually several days at least.

It sounds more like a panic attack. I am curious, what do you think were the psychotic features? It's possible for anxiety to be bad enough to cause hallucinations/some psychosis, I am just not seeing that in your post? I could be missing it?"
bipolar,erte3y2,t1_ers3v7y,1561239809.0,"You didn't work yourself to bipolar, it was already there and the stress made it worse.

I also can't make heads or tails of your comment and I am concerned that you are manic. Please stay safe."
bipolar,ert9pyn,t3_c3tzrt,1561236340.0,I can't tell if I am okay or not. Not related to bipolar; have a lot going on in life right now.
bipolar,ert82xe,t1_ert5l4x,1561235056.0,"Damn, I am sorry to hear that. You overcome a deadly brain disorder just to be diagnosed with a different one. You will find a way to deal with bipolar as well; you are resilient."
bipolar,erszzlm,t3_c3n9v6,1561228703.0,"No, you're just ""buzzed"" or ""high"" off of caffeine. 
It doesn't even trigger mania in me, just anxiety if I drink to much. However, if I am already hypomanic it can make it worse.

If caffeine could give you bipolar there would be a huge warning out about it. You know, so people would stop developing bipolar.

Excessive use can cause a psychotic break, however, so be careful about that."
bipolar,ersxs9m,t1_ersfen5,1561227014.0,"I feel called out by your post.

It's like you know the things I have tried to do..."
bipolar,ersvqae,t3_c3qq20,1561225456.0,Why just make out when you can have public sex?
bipolar,ersvky0,t3_c3sec6,1561225346.0,Call your psychiatrist and tell them what you are experiencing. They may need to temporarily adjust your meds to knock you out of it.
bipolar,ersvepv,t1_erry7xb,1561225219.0,I'm laughing because I also listened to true crime podcasts while sewing.
bipolar,ersv93m,t1_errlel6,1561225100.0,"It could probably be exhibited that way with some people. I have a lot of energy, so I don't. I run around with racing thoughts, with the dread and hopelessness of depression following me around. I was actually originally diagnosed based off a mixed episode; I took all my medications, got in the car, and booked it down the freeway, contemplating whether I wanted to OD on my meds or not. So I had the impulsivity and energy of mania, with the suicidality of depression.

I hope that clears it up a bit? It can be difficult to explain, as mania and depression seem like polar opposites, yet can occur at the same time."
bipolar,errsm7w,t3_c3lt0n,1561181740.0,"I love you, too."
bipolar,errs74s,t1_errrdea,1561181247.0,"It gets worse if left untreated. Also, the chances of you surviving it are a lot lower without medical help. Get on meds."
bipolar,errs47b,t3_c3j917,1561181150.0,"Well if you think about it, we're ALL a little bit epileptic.

I mean, we all have brains and have a seizure threshold, amirite?"
