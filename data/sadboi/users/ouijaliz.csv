dating_advice,fjyhx1t,t1_fjxewfa,1583697116.0,"Thank you for replying!

I happen to agree that a conversation starter is much more my scene than a hey or immediately wanting to meet up. A lot of people just wanting to meet up very quickly and Im not really interested in that to be honest, I need to know if I even connect a little first.

What's been your best conversation starters?"

lonely,fivu46u,t3_f2rsfs,1582768102.0,I'm married and I still feel this way. I don't know why I need constant verification and getting it from my husband isn't enough anymore. I need to feel wanted and loved. I hate myself for this.
SuicideWatch,fivr8su,t3_eyjkyc,1582766260.0,"I'm 28. I nothing gets better. I don't know how to stop it. I have pockets where I feel like I've beaten this feeling but then I wake up and ask what's the point. Why get dressed and go to my minimum wage job to just come home and get undressed again. Is this my life forever now. I have so much wasted potential. I'm stuck in a marriage to someone I think I'm falling out of love with. I want to cry and run away all the time. I've never had a good family so I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't have good social skills so I can't maintain friendships. I hate feeling lonely all the time. I want to isolate and then hate myself for it. I feel worthless and wasted. I hate losing control ps don't rely on drugs or alcohol anymore but I have nothing to pass the time. I think about my death alot. I've written my suicide not ein my head almost permanently. I know I need help but having narcissistic tenancies coupled with a high iq and ability to use people, I turn counselling sessions into a game. I've not been able to find mental help that's worked. Mind games bore me. I hat emy life but I'd hate my life even if it was different. I've self sabotaged my life enough times now. If you find the answer to life, hit me up. It sucks being a suicidal 28 year old female."
