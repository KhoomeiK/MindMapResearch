I’m glad that we can both recognize the absolute shittiness that reality is for situations like this but it is still important to be mindful of the language we use when discussing it because imo the original comment* didn’t come off as concern for the struggle OP may face by reporting his behavior but critiquing the fact it could be misconstrued they had a relationship.

confession,fqf934f,t1_fqf3rpo,1589320772.0,"Lol “boss queen feminism”, that’s a new one. 


My original comment was expressing my opinion that it is worse for a woman to be dismissive of another woman’s gender based fears because of the likelihood of sharing similar experiences and traumas than it is for a man who will not have experience in the same level of sexism, misogyny, and gender based trauma. That’s my opinion and you can take it or leave it. It’s an objective opinion and has nothing to do with feminism so it’s better not to conflate the two.


In this case, OP never generalized men as a whole it said they all want to sleep with her or said she’s terrified of every man. Her confession about not giving someone a ride who gave her a creep vibe was twisted and attacked as “paranoid” about all men by someone who has no other knowledge of the situation than what we can read here. I’m annoyed by all the men and people in these comments doing the same but again my opinion, not feminism’s, is it’s worse for a woman to belittle and dismiss that fear/concern/worry/anxiety.

Since you don’t have experience, lemme say it isn’t that bad. If you take care of your car and get regular maintenance, you should pass. It’s a check for brakes, windshield wipers, working lights, steering, and multiple other basic safety requirements. If you don’t pass, you’ll usually be given an opportunity to fix them in the moment or return at a later time to get re-inspected.

StardewValley,fon9654,t1_fon49g9,1587914906.0,"I won't be responding past this comment because I don't want to continue wasting my time on what appears to be a useless arguement.

I did call him a shitty husband and father because that's my opinion on the actions and words he, a fictional character, exhibits in the game. I am not calling him a ""raging asshole"" (that's twisting my words there, buddy) and I don't particularly care for you telling me what I am doing:

> What you are doing is taking a situation like where he finds himself in a certain role and reacts a certain way and then you take that to mean that what he displayed there is essential to who he is as a person. 

Again, I expressed my opinion on Pierre and never attacked you or critiqued you for your opinion. In fact, I agreed with your opinion on the adultery being excusable and I *never* argued he wasn't the worst of the two. I highlighted the traits and actions that I see as flaws which, again my opinion, make him a less than ideal partner just like Caroline. I personally wouldn't stay with someone who cheats on me any sooner than I would someone who yells at my adult child over outdated gender roles (""What are you doing in the graveyard, anyway? This is no place for a young lady!). Also, ""frisky""? Talk about a dramatic assessment. It's a conversation about her dream to adventure in the caves. 

On the opposite side, when Caroline tries to control the way Abigail dresses and is called out for it (rightfully so in my opinion), she acknowledges her mistake and apologizes. That's a much better reaction than getting ""a bit grouchy if something objectively bad happens to them"" which is E X A C T L Y what is happening here.

I don't know why you wanted to be so aggressive this morning/whatever time it is for you but it's really unnecessary. You don't know me nor do you my life, history, and what I do. You cannot know how kind or positive or mean I am based off of one comment just because you don't like. And as I said earlier, I don't appreciate a stranger being disrespectful, insulting me by calling me ""hatefull"" (hateful* btw) and ""negative"", and dictating the kind of person I need to be. When someone disagrees with you, pushes back, acts in a way you wouldn't, etc., becoming aggressive or hostile like you have been isn't the way to change their mind or see from your perspective. It's entirely counterproductive most of the time. Truly, I wish that you have a better day/evening than you've made my morning but I'm done responding now. Bye."

Part of getting better is learning to love yourself so that you don’t have to act out or do bad things for whatever reasons.

But. Not. As. Currently. Written."
ElizabethWarren,fkkcj43,t1_fkkc0vu,1584280555.0,The protesters are being used as a subject. There’s intent. Effect = to cause. Warren isn’t being used as a subject. It’s passive. Affect = producing a change.
ElizabethWarren,fkkc7x2,t1_fkkbwy5,1584280289.0,"I said “most commonly” referring to both and ‘effect’ doesn’t work in this sentence. Using your examples, Warren isn’t the subject of the sentence, she’s not intentionally do this action, so it wouldn’t be correct to use ‘effect’ as a verb. It’d have to be rewritten."
ElizabethWarren,fkkbq0n,t1_fkkabj9,1584279842.0,"It’s [easier to remember](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/8b/00/5c8b001ef62b148f47f8ff4ce3633720.jpg) ‘affect’ is most commonly a verb and ‘effect’ is the result. In this title, it would definitely be ‘affect’."

EverythingScience,fkk72lk,t1_fkjn0de,1584275781.0,"No, it’s not because our country is literally founded on a separation of church and state. No “higher” authority should come into play when deciding the laws of our land."
lynchburg,fkegcv1,t1_fkeemuk,1584112616.0,"Again, I am not supporting or defending their actions. I didn't even say don't shame, criticize, or fight against their opinions/beliefs. 

 But when you are LITERALLY wishing them dead while simultaneously complaining about them wishing you dead is wrong, you are NOT better than them. No matter what you try to tell yourself is a justifiable reason, it's not. I've been called a cunt, bitch, failed abortion, worthless piece of property who doesn't know her place, and been threatened with rape and death. But at no point did I want any of those people to die because that's fucked up.

You're acting the exact same on their level. The fact that you're so oblivious to the similarities between you and them is ironic considering it supports your argument about not changing people. It's not enough support to actually make you right but still. Pretty funny to me.

As much of an asshole and, yes, bigot as you are, I don't ever wish you death. I hope you learn to fight for your beliefs and passions without violence and hatred in your heart. It's completely possible and saying otherwise is a defeatist mindset that I don't care to indulge with any further. Have a day, dude!"
lynchburg,fkedfku,t1_fked2zu,1584110849.0,"Calling for their deaths is NOT holding people accountable. That’s bigotry, or the intolerance of people who hold different beliefs than you. Again, if you’re so bothered by their inaccurate opinions, then spend your time educating people and spreading facts and truth. Not fucking death wishes. You’re not better than them rn."
lynchburg,fkecoy5,t1_fkecgsv,1584110394.0,That’s not being honest. That’s being an asshole and a quitter. Everyone has the potential to change. Denying them the opportunity (and their fucking lives if you had your way) makes you no better than the bigots and hateful people you’re talking about.
lynchburg,fkebv3w,t1_fkeaggu,1584109876.0,"I feel sorry for you, not them. How much hate must be in your heart to wish death on them. Trump is one of the worst fucking things to happen to our country ever but I’d much rather his followers get educated, see the error of their ways, and work to better our society instead of just fucking dying. Ignorance can be fixed. Death can’t. Seriously, dude."

You could toss in a few bucks to alleviate your worry/guilt but nobody would think less of you for not donating in this situation. 


And tbh if they do judge, they should probably be listening to the sermon more because that’s a no-no haha."
