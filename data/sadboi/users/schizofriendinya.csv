What worked
-putting Irish spring bar soap near my legs when laying in bed. Strange.. but worked. Didn't want to be in bed all day though so I grabbed big socks and put a bar of soap in each and went walking around with bars of soap just to do stuff.
-once the akathisia started moving from my legs to the rest of my body I was Stressed to the max and found that if I smoked a cigarette then the akathisia disappeared for a little while.. maybe ten minutes or so.
-then after getting full body akathisia I told my doctor I Needed something for that so he prescribed Artane/trihexyphenidyl which worked, but when I took a pill of artane before my morning meds including Ativan I threw up, so I took the Ativan and then fifteen minutes later the artane.
-then I was switched to Primidone which worked and didn't make me throw up.

For your doctor to say ""it will go away once you're on 15mg"" is sickening. There is no way that she can know that. Most of these meds have caused more problems than helping.

Just keep doing what they say and once you're outta there take Care of Yourself and do what You Need to do. This is your body and your mind."

They paid for gas money and occasionally a lump of CASH.  And once in a while they gave me random items from the clinical trial sponsor. Things like lunch box, water bottle, keychain, etc... As if I wanted to have things with the name of the group that did this study.

About a year in I told them I was done getting the injections so we switched to the pills.

Even though I quit the injections I was still able to get paid money, because when I signed the paperwork at the beginning there were only three things I was signing for and one was that ""I don't have to take the med to be a part of the study. And now thinking back, they had me do tests once in a while where I'd have to check true or false for things I signed for like not having to take the meds to be a part of the study, and other things. This was almost five years ago, difficult to remember

If you're going to do a clinical trial do some research on what medication they are doing if there is any research at all and see if and how much they are going to pay you.

These clinical trials sorta make me think of this vape crisis. At first it was ""Vapes are healthier, better, and can help you quit"" and now people are getting sick from them."
