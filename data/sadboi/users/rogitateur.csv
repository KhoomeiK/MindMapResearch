I do that with some of my auditory ones, since they're relatively unobtrusive and harmless. Delusions are tougher to ignore, obviously, but it might be beneficial to work with a therapist on living with them. That being said, medication can do wonders for those positive symptoms--you just have to go through the process of finding and fine-tuning the right one.

Plus if your income is low enough, you qualify for grants which is like getting a scholarship--you don't have to pay it back when you're done. You might also qualify for scholarships based on your disability or other info about you (race, background, religion, gender, etc.), so you could talk to the financial aid office at a school you want to go to about applying for those.

I'm in school right now even though I have very little hope of working in the field I'm studying. I know that seems like a waste, but learning new stuff is keeping my mind occupied and being in school is keeping me around other people. Being isolated and having no challenges was really bad for me and made my symptoms go berserk after I had to quit my job (because of symptoms). If you like learning, it's not the worst plan. Plus you CAN work on disability if you think you're able--there's just a limit on how much you can earn.

schizoaffective,evdb3u7,t1_evd8cmu,1564434119.0,Here's info from the NIH: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806335/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806335/) :)
schizoaffective,evd7mf2,t3_cjb4k5,1564431911.0,"I do that, too--I rehearse what I'm going to say for important conversations but then when the time comes I screw it up completely. Hope the phone call went ok."
schizoaffective,evd4r9n,t1_evd3r86,1564430096.0,"Yeah, if you asked me for details about that time now I probably wouldn't be able to give you much. I just remember the big stuff."
schizoaffective,evd4dqw,t1_evcxu1e,1564429860.0,"I wouldn't use it to diagnose yourself or to replace consulting with a doctor, but this page is pretty much the same info you'd find on an NIH/NIMH page about schizophrenia but with slightly less technical language. I linked it for that reason--it's an easy to read explanation of the prodrome. Most of the other hits you'd get googling it are pretty academic."
schizoaffective,evcm3oc,t1_evbedqw,1564418269.0,"I drank a lot more during this time than I do now, which could've just been because it was college, but I also felt a lot more able to push through the paranoia and fear if I was drinking."
schizoaffective,evclyu4,t1_evbftoh,1564418185.0,"Same--I became way more paranoid and afraid of people, even family. Intrusive thoughts also became more distressing and disruptive. I didn't realize that my symptoms were symptoms until much later, either."
