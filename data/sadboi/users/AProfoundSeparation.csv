What I'm getting at is that what you call as ""me"" is not a solid or unchanging thing. Whether or not there is a ""me"" at all can be up for debate in this context. Regardless of whether there is such a thing as ""self"", you'll see upon investigation that theres no one *thing* that you can point to, physically or with your awareness, that you could call as a self. I think it was Alan Watts that said trying to use your senses to understand the self is like trying to bite your own teeth.

If there is such a thing as a self, you'll find that you're not truly aware of it if you investigate. Usually when people refer to themselves, they're talking about a particular feeling or mental construct. A story about what's happened in the past or might happen in the future, combined with a collection of ever-changing sensory phenomena. Those things aren't you, they're the thoughts and experiences that you are having.

The way I put it is this: if there is a subject-object relationship, you cannot be both at the same time. If you are aware of it, it is not you. *You* are the one that is aware, not the thing that you are aware *of*. 

Psychedelic experiences aren't necessary to come to this understanding. Simply sit and observe. Try to find that thing that you call as ""self"". For many that I have spoken to, what they find is a singular point of awareness beyond their typical sensory experiences. If you can find that point, focus on it for awhile. See how long you can maintain awareness of that. If you observe for awhile, you'll see that it can't be you. You're observing it, therefore you are not it."

What we call as ""self"" is an ever changing thing that can never be pinned down. This is a fundamental teaching of the Buddha: impermanence in all things.

This realization is simple to come to if you're willing to look. Just try to find where ""you"" are with your senses. Can you see yourself? Hear yourself? Feel yourself? Of course not, these are just sensory experiences that you are having. So if you can't find yourself with your senses, how else could you find where ""you"" are? What you'll see upon further investigation is that what you've been calling as ""myself"" is just a recurring thought pattern that has just as much solidity as your thoughts about what's for dinner. It arises and passes away moment by moment. 

I think many people experience this unconsciously, actually. When you're not thinking of yourself, where is your ""self""? It's not there. It's been replaced by your thoughts of this person or that show you watched or the words you're reading on the screen. Until thoughts of ""self"" return again and you think ""ah yes I'm still here"", but that's a trick. For a few moments, ""you"" were gone. Body and mind were still functioning, experience still happening, awareness still occurring, but theres no ""one"" to experience it unless you can simultaneously hold the thought of ""I"" while you go about your daily life.

That's fair. Honestly, like you I see no moral issue in eating plants or animals. I think the moral problem with eating meat doesn't come from the meat itself, but from the way it is gathered.

>They’re almost like simple machines in a way. Of course your point is still valid. I’ve heard convincing arguments that humans lack free will. 

Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm in the ""no free will"" camp, which in my opinion indirectly bolsters the argument that plants have subjective experiences too. 

>They’re playing an entirely different game.

You're absolutely right on that. Have you ever seen the TED talk where the guy anthropomorphizes plants and basically says that grass domesticated humans? It was a pretty funny perspective, but he made some good points. 

>As far as I know no animals have evolved to encourage other organisms to eat them!

Do parasites count? Some of them modify the host's behavior to encourage being eaten by other animals. I don't know of anything else that does... that would make for some interesting sci-fi!"

I just want to make it completely clear that I'm not making that argument either. Even if they did somehow experience pain, and we knew about it, we would just have to accept that for what it is. Humans have to eat something, and even if we anthropomorphize them to the fullest extent, many plants basically want us to eat them.

However:

>we also know that there are very simple chemical reactions governing the lives of plants.

The same could be said for humans, although you'd probably need to substitute ""simple"" for ""complex"". The only reason we all agree that humans have subjective experience is because I know that I do and it's not unreasonable to assume that other humans do too. I could just as easily say that humans are nothing but chemical reactions happening in response to stimuli. They have no ""will"" or ""desires"" and their vocal claims to the contrary are also just evolutionary adaptations that cause positive reactions in other human systems."

>They can increase production of defensive chemicals but they typically do so either as a response to warning from other plants, or due to environmental stress. 

The plants must be aware of the environmental stress, or the warning from other plants in order to respond, right? I'd argue that that is evidence of some kind of sensation being experienced by the plant. However, I highly doubt that they would have any opinion about that sensation either way. 

Am I thinking about this all wrong?"

Exactly the point I was trying to make. I made no claims regarding this. I simply stated that you made an unscientific claim and framed it as though it were a scientific fact.

>Of course I don’t know 100% what plants feel. Science isn’t about 100% certainty really. 


I never claimed that you did, or that science was about 100% certainty. What I said was that you are making a claim without evidence and presenting it as though it were a fact because you are a botanist. 

My argument is essentially that the most scientifically responsible thing you can say on the subject is something to the effect of ""we have no way of knowing whether or not plants can feel pain (or anything else for that matter) but I suspect that they cannot.""

Your argument was much better when you talked about how fruit is an evolutionary development that *requires* being eaten in order to spread seeds through animals. It would be pretty fucked up if that process was also excruciatingly painful to the plant, but honestly unsurprising. Nature is brutal.

>why would pain have been selected for in plants when plants have no mechanism to end the pain? The whole point of pain is to make you stop it by removing yourself from danger.

Put more simply, pain triggers an animal to try to change the situation in a way that makes the pain stop. I'd argue that many plants do this, like the trees in Africa that make their leaves taste bad in order to get the giraffes to stop eating them. To me, that would be a valid reason for it to feel pain; to trigger it to start making the bad-tasting chemicals. Movement is not inherently necessary in order to escape pain, although it is probably much more efficient."

They put a needle through the human's hand. The human doesn't move or react, but their instruments can see the human's brain light up. 

I suspect these aliens would all agree that the human in question is not feeling anything at all. What they see on their instruments would be explained as simple chemical reactions responding to the environment. 

Can you see the similarity between those aliens and what you're saying? No one can definitively prove the existence of a subjective experience for anyone but themselves. The reason we are generally willing to accept that plants don't have a subjective experience is because they are so vastly different from us biologically, and because they don't protest when you harm them. 

Eating vegan is still commendable for the effects it has on the planet, and even if plants suffer we would just have to accept that and eat them anyway. Maybe with a little bit more gratefulness.

Here's a bit from Sadhguru, who I think puts these concepts in easily understandable terms.

If you really want to dive deep, though, look for translations of vedic literature. The Rigveda has quite a bit about chakras. 

It's important to understand, however, that when diving into vedic texts you need to shift your perspective a bit. Many of the concepts are illustrated with deeply layered symbolism and analogy, and some may sound like complete nonsense without knowledge of other writings. It takes a lot of time for a layperson to connect all of those dots and see the big picture. 

The Baghavad Gita would be a good place to start. It's a bit like a Hindu bible, although some might balk at that comparison. It is more easily digestible for someone who is new to Hindu philosophy, and contains many nuggets of wisdom that you might find insightful or inspiring.

It is said that many yogis created images of beings in order to assist them in their spiritual practice. Even after their death, shadows or remnants of these beings continue to exist within the realm of Anahata. One of these beings is Kali, who I have seen referenced in several trip reports.

To tie it to your ""B"" answer, Anahata is symbolized by two intersecting triangles.

The ""skill"" you are looking to hone can be compared to strengthening your body with exercise. Every single time you notice that you are distracted, and mindfully bring your attention back, it is like doing one pushup. Over time, the muscles strengthen and it becomes easier. With consistent practice, it becomes almost effortless. 

Simply put, you just need to keep practicing. Every time that you notice you are distracted, and bring your attention back to your prayer, it is a small victory. Keep going, and it will keep getting easier.

If you think you need additional practice outside of your daily prayers, meditation can also be helpful.

In regards to inner peace, you may find mindfulness practice to be beneficial. When you practice mindfulness, you observe your thoughts and feelings without judging them.

Oftentimes, we find ourselves thinking negatively about this or that, and then an internal story begins. We try to ""think away"" our feelings by telling ourselves ""I shouldn't feel this way"" but that is counterproductive. There's an old saying that applies here: what you resist, persists. 

Allow yourself to feel the way you feel, and allow it to pass. This may sound obvious, but I will say it anyway for your benefit: all things pass. Your anxiety will pass. Your discomfort will pass. Your happiness will pass. Your sadness will pass. Your pain will pass. Your pleasure will pass. You must learn to allow these things to move through you, instead of trying to control them.

When you become more skillful at noticing your thought patterns and allowing them to pass, inner peace will be a side effect.

Think of it this way: if you wish to grow flowers, you needn't think about flowers. You need to think about soil, manure, water, and sunlight. Flowers come on their own if the conditions are right. If you create the right conditions within yourself, peace will be a consequence.

It seems to me, though, that Biden didn't *actively* try to get him that job. I mean, if I ran a business and Leonardo DiCaprio's kid came in to apply for a job, I'd probably be more likely to hire them based on who their dad is. Leonardo probably wouldn't have to say anything to convince me.

Also, are you sure that being on the board of a corrupt company must mean that you are taking part in the corruption itself? I'm not sure that's always true. Investigations into corruption of other companies/governments generally lead to the conclusion that some are in on it while others are not, so I'm inclined to think the Burisma situation may be similar.

Furthermore, the removal of Viktor Shokin was a declared provision of US foreign policy. Biden didn't to get Shokin out alone, the entire US Department of State was at his back. It seems misleading to me to paint it as though Biden single-handedly demolished the career of ""the guy who was investigating his son"" when there is evidence that wasn't the case at all. Besides, Shokin wasn't fired until months after Biden's work in Ukraine, and the reason was that the I.M.F. threatened to withdraw funding because they wanted Shokin gone. According to pretty much all of the sources, Shokin was corrupt and should not have held the office that he did.

The difference here, though, is that not only was Trump's withholding of aid money not in accordance with official US foreign policy, it was against the law. That is, at least, according to the Government Accountability Office, which is an independent (read: non-partisan) organization.

Karma is not the consequences of your action, it is the action itself. The situation one finds themselves in is generally out of their control, but how one reacts to that situation is. The reaction is the karma, not the situation.

Suffering is not something that happens in the body. Suffering is something that happens in the mind. It is a feeling that arises when one is dissatisfied with the way things are in a given moment. You are not suffering because you are in pain, you are suffering because you want the pain to go away. In any given moment, we have the opportunity to choose one of two options: accept it as it is, or try to change it. When we accept a situation as it is, *even if that situation is unpleasant*, suffering does not arise. It can't, because suffering only arises from dissatisfaction with the present moment. As such, suffering (stress) is your karma. It is something that you create.

OP is 100% on the money here, and I hope clearing up the misunderstanding may help you in your situation.

Maybe you could give a name to the ""energy"" you are describing, and how it can be positive or negative? What does ""dimensionless"" mean? As far as I am aware, that isn't a real term.

Also, the link you posted here has some pretty shaky logic and uses words in ways that don't really coincide with their usual definitions. The premises also don't really lead to the conclusions proposed either.

For example, the author (you?) begins by stating that the difference between MAMA and other philosophers/mystics/gurus is that MAMA uses metrics that can be measured. Then they state that those metrics are emotions? Emotions cannot be measured in any objective sense. We can only correlate brain activity in certain regions with people's reports they are experiencing certain emotions. This is not the same as objectively measuring an emotion. 

Following this, the author then concludes that ""emotions have value"" because they can be measured? That's just straight up nonsense, unless they are using a different definition of ""having value"" than the one that is normally used in this context. Perhaps they mean ""value"" in the qualitative sense, like how numbers are representative of numeric value? Either way you take it, this simply can't be stated as a ""truth"" based on the premise provided. The premise that emotions can be measured is false. We can determine whether or not someone is likely to be experiencing a specific emotion, but not how intense or subtle that emotion may be subjectively. That's the thing with emotions: they are subjective experiences.

Next is the claim that we can't understand anything without emotion. This is based on the previous claim that emotions have value, which is a total non sequitur. Emotions having or not having value has absolutely no bearing on whether or not they are required in order to understand things. 

Secondly, in relation to the same claim, the author is claiming that things like ""discipline"" and ""order"" are emotions. This is not the case. Discipline could even be described as the opposite of an emotion, as it is sometimes used to override emotion in favor of reason.

There's a lot more that's wrong with what you and the author of that blog said, but those are the first things I noticed.

>Uh, yeah we can? We can draw out shapes in braille dots and have blind people feel what the shapes look like with their hands

While this is true, this does not mean that if the blind person were to have their sight restored they could recognize the shapes. They can't. There is no association between tactile sensations of a shape and the visual experience of a shape. This is essentially Molyneux's Question, which has been answered.

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/health/research/26blind.html

It takes an incredibly short amount of time to start making associations between visual experience and tactile sensations, but those associations cannot be made without having the experience of both. As soon as the formerly blind person touches a cube, he knows that it is a cube. He cannot tell by sight alone."

In my mind it doesn't feel like so many questions. It feels like one huge question that I can't quite put my finger on. The question came to me after a particularly heavy trip, so maybe you can understand what I'm getting at. It's like an itch in the back of my mind that won't go away no matter how much I try to scratch it. 

It feels like a paradox. I can experience reality for what it is, separating myself from the labels that my mind applies to it, yet I still don't know what it is. If you can explain that and tell me how to verify that what you say is true, you've got a follower for your religion."

Not actually sure if this is true. Brain scans show high activity in the visual cortex on DMT even in congenitally blind (blind from birth) individuals, and there is also anecdotal evidence to suggest they do see something. What that something is, however, is difficult to determine. The individuals having the experiences have no frame of reference to definitively say ""I saw this shape/color"" because they have no idea what shapes or colors are. That doesn't mean they didn't see shapes or colors, they just have no vocabulary or references to describe their experience."
RationalPsychonaut,f92vayt,t3_e373yl,1575042752.0,"When you understand this concept on a level beyond just intellectually understanding ""there is no such thing as inherent meaning,"" there comes with that a certain kind of freedom. This freedom allows you to choose how you perceive anything from the most basic social or business interactions to the complex world of your inner thoughts and emotions.

In my experience, we are generally slaves to our preconceptions. Some are very deeply rooted in our psyche, and they inform the meaning we ascribe to every situation we encounter. When we truly understand that meaning is created from within ourselves, we switch roles with our preconceptions, and in doing so we become the masters of meaning in our lives. The intelligence of our minds is so incredible that we can simulate multiple realities in a fraction of a second. When you don't have a million preconceptions limiting the possibilities of that process, it seems as though everything becomes immensely easier.

As to how you decide on where meaning comes from, I suppose it all comes down to the most basic things you want out of life. I think pretty much everyone wants the same things out of life on a basic level: peace, joy, love, to be respected as a human being... those kinds of things. Whatever it is you truly want out of life, use that as a guide by which to paint your perceptions.

I am trying to learn to draw the images I have in my mind, which is a bit different from your goal, but I think the fundamentals are the same.

 Here's what I have done:

1. I set rigid deadlines with consequences that are serious enough to make me want to avoid them. 

2. I got a friend/coworker to hold me accountable and also enforce the consequences if I do not follow through.

The rules I have are very simple, but I find them effective. I must practice one drawing related skill (shading, straight lines, curved lines, etc.) For at least 15 minutes per day, and spend another 15-20 minutes drawing a picture of something from my mind. I must show the results of this practice to my friend every day when we arrive at work. It's important that I show it when we arrive, because I could conceivably cheat and do something at my desk thus avoiding the consistency required to build skills effectively. Every time I miss a day or forget my sketch book, I have to give my friend $20.

Because my friend has been watching my progress, he is now keenly aware of exactly how much work I can get done in the time constraints allotted, so I cannot slack off or just try to throw something together and fool him. Being held accountable and having a set schedule makes things very easy for me to keep up with. My drawing skills have drastically improved over the last several months, and I've only lost my $20 one time.

If your brain was swapped with someone else's, your bodies would be swapped too, because your brain (not a singular part of your brain, but your entire brain) contains all of the mechanisms through which ""you"" interact with the body that you're in.

Physically speaking, the simplest and most reductionist answer to your question would be: your brain. Not one part of your brain, but the whole brain. We are just brains piloting meat suits. There is some debate over the origin and nature of consciousness, but most of us can agree that it is intimately tied to the brain. Each part of your brain performs a function, but none of them are specifically the part that makes you ""you"". It's all of it together.

Edit: Your question is a bit more complex than it appears on its face. To truly answer it, you have to know who/what you really are. I thought about it further, and if you were to swap brains with someone one brain cell at a time, no one really knows at what point you would swap bodies.

The materialist view of consciousness is that subjective experience emerges from all of the complex activities of the brain and body communicating in unison. If this is correct, that would mean that consciousness isn't contained in any particular part of the body, but is a product of the whole system.

The panpsychist view of consciousness states that all matter is conscious. Even a single atom has a subjective experience. When more atoms come together, consciousness gets more and more complex. If that is correct, then what you experience as ""you"" is a collection of the subjective experiences of each atom in your body at once.

The difficult part of your question is that consciousness is less of a ""thing"" and more of an idea or concept. It is an adjective to describe having a subjective experience. So... what is an idea made of? What is a thought made of? Can you touch it, smell it, taste it, hear it, or see it with your own two eyes? No, because consciousness is the thing that gives rise to the experience of all of the senses. How can you use your senses to experience the thing that creates your experience of the senses?

Edit: An additional response to your question.

I'm sure that not only did your reply change the mind of the individual who made that comment, but it also has rippled through society and created a wave of positivity where dozens of people will choose not to call something they find visually unappealing an eyesore. Your reddit comment has bettered the collective of humanity and we are all better off for it. I am simply dripping with gratitude and humbleness for the opportunity to interact with someone who puts themselves on the line in order to save us all from such abhorrent people who serve to bring us down. How dare someone express their opinion in such a way? I can only hope that you will continue to be there for us in our time of need, for there will always be those who say out loud when they find something to be ugly, and we can't have that in our culture. Many blessings upon you, my lord. You are doing God's work."
