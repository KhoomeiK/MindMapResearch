BDSMAdvice,fr4qmu3,t1_fr1qrql,1589894878.0,"Firstly, thank you for such a thoughtful response! I found myself nodding while reading, particularly the first bit. I truly enjoy being with my partner, so don’t want him to think that what we do together is subpar - like you said, it’s just that I’d like to explore more of my kinks with him.

I think I’ll try to work ‘milder’ things into our conversation, even something like holding me down (because ‘bondage’ might sound a bit scary). Admittedly when I do try to bring it up, he usually thinks of the stereotypical ‘sexy’ kind of bondage. 

Most of my ideas and desires in BDSM stem from my conversations and experiences in previous relationships, so I’ll try to look for resources online that both of us can access and think about :)"
BDSMAdvice,fr4pvnn,t1_fr16f0z,1589894410.0,"I’ve brought up bondage and light BDSM in our conversations, but his ideas about it seem restricted to popular culture reference (think the blindfolds and cuffs in Fifty Shades of Grey). 

But he’s mentioned that he might enjoy being on the submissive side, which is a great sign for me compared to him completely shutting down. So even though my interests and experiences have been heavily on the submissive side in D/s and Dd/Lg, I’m currently reading up on how I can practice being more dominant, eg. how to tie simple knots and introduce simple scenes/dialogue. It’s something I’m willing (and a bit excited!) to explore. 

However, it’s a bit disheartening that he seems disinterested about taking a more dominant role. Sometimes he jokingly says that I act very submissive in the bedroom, which can be hurtful because I enjoy being submissive and feel slightly ashamed for it. But once the lockdown eases, we can have more conversations and explore more together. I’m hopeful :)"
BDSMAdvice,fr4oood,t1_fr2caxx,1589893652.0,"The Pornhub and chill sounds like a great idea! My partner and I are separated during the lockdown, so this might be a good way to weave some BDSM into our conversations while having a fun time :) And thank you for your advice regarding the safeguards; I don’t want to push things onto him, or make him feel like he’s obliged to do things, but at the same time I don’t want to completely suppress this part of my sexual identity. I hope you’re safe!!"
EatingDisorders,fqlh0so,t1_fql5844,1589457865.0,"I agree with this!! I’m also recovering, and one thing that has helped me bodycheck less is wearing big tees and loose pants. This not only makes bodychecking less ‘useful’ (since you can’t see your figure as easily), but also makes it more difficult for others to comment on your figure."

Needafriend,fc2cygy,t1_fc1pehx,1577352890.0,"i had the same thought last week, when i came home for the holidays. i’d love to chat with you, and of course you too R! midnight thoughts and such :-) here’s my little thought for today: i can never catch the moment i doze off, so i wonder if i can ever explain what it feels like to drift into sleep."
