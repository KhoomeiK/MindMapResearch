AskReddit,fnj1mst,t3_g1u0ex,1586990274.0,"There have been plenty but this was pretty recent. I work in a small family owned Italian place where everything is homemade so the menu is more limited than bigger chain type of restaurants. 

So this family of three comes in a mom, dad and small child. I start by asking them if they'd like something to drink, the dad replies with his drink order so I move to his wife.
Wife:"" do you have sweet tea?""
Me: no ma'am I'm sorry we have Pepsi products as well as bottled water and tap water"" :)
Wife: ""ughhhh ewww I am not drinking tap water""
Me:"" oh well thats no problem I do have bottled"" :)
She then rolled her eyes at me so I asked her child what they would like and they said Sierra mist, so I asked the woman if she wanted anything and she said no so I said okay lmk if you change your mind. I left to get drinks and then brought them to the table. 

As I approached the table I asked if they had any questions and the woman did. She asked me if we had a type of Italian appetizer with a name I couldn't understand nor had I ever heard of so I asked her to describe it; she couldn't so she huffed at me and snapped that they needed more time. The husband and child stared at the table like they were well aware of what was happening. 

I was worried so after I left the table I told my boss about the interaction as well as some of my male coworkers just in case this was about to get rowdy. 

I approached the table again and they still hadn't decided but this woman asked me if had ravioli after not seeing it on the rather small menu. I explained that we didn't have it but we did have a stuffed shell meal that is similar and very good. She put the menu down and with her elbows on the table she held her temples and said ""ahhh what the fuck"". Idk what to do so I freeze with my eyes wide open and look at the husband. At this point he tries to grab the menu from her so I tell him ill be back in another few minutes. 

At this point some bread from the kitchen comes out so I just drop it off at the table for them and walk away. 

I waited about 7 minutes to go back to the table and ask if they were ready this time she was, but now her husband has snapped at her because he it not ready to order because he ""hasn't had a chance to look at the menu"" because of how she was acting. At this point my manager has over heard how they were speaking to me and each other and she is ready to toss them out. 


So I waited even longer and finally after another 10 minutes they were ready. I listened very closely to their complicated and precise order and even double checked back with them what they asked for because I knew they would be idiotic about incorrect food. So once it was well established I put the order in. 

They then proceeded to continue to order side dishes and made to order things like Alfredo sauce that they wanted immediately. So i rushed the hell out the kitchen for those things because I was not going to be yelled at by this woman. 

The food came out rather quickly and everything was correct. I was so relieved. Once they began to eat she wasn't as mean but she barely ate anything and asked for a to go box fairly quickly. 

The rest of the family continued to eat, and not long after they left; no they didn't tip."
AskReddit,flj1r5q,t3_foug6e,1585196371.0,Before my area goes on lockdown I purchased a couple kits to start cross stitching! I've never done it before but it's very soothing so far. I started getting anxious earlier today so I sat down and decided to start one. Before I knew it I was already making progress and I feel so much better now I think I'll actually be able to sleep tonight. And I have a new hobby! Hopefully something to show for myself once the lockdown is over.

At the the end of the interaction he said not to worry he doesn't bite, he only nibbles; then he winked at me and a rat ran out from under the clothes on his lap and into the restaurant. 

I was mortified."

I remember a Hannah Montana handheld video game, a dirty plush pokemon keychain, and a few other odds and ends. What stood out the most was the brand new meter that people use to check the voltage of batteries (I think). I didn't use it then, and i still don't know what id need that for. 

As a 12 year old girl I was very confused.
I did keep the cigar box though."

Makeup,f305djp,t3_deuevu,1570546783.0,"A good way to practise would be to first draw on a thick cat eye. When you do this you dont have ro worry about how close the lashes are to your lash line. Just find an easy area, maybe less curved and apply it there. I have trouble with my outer corners so i place the lashes along my inner corner and angle them up as i lay the lashes along my eye. It gives a very open eyed effect. Then i use mascara to blend the real and the fake, and it lasts all day!"
sexeducation,f2i0syr,t3_ddatpl,1570250729.0,"Since I started menstruating Ive never missed a period, ever, so I track my periods because they are very acurate, and I use condoms. I have never had an actual worrisome scare, but in the last 7 years only two condoms have broken, so just in case id buy planB anyway just to be sure. 

So i think as long as you use them correctly, track your periods with fair accuracy, and keep planB in your cabinet you should be fine!"

After choking down my emotions for an entire shift, I closed up shop and thought I'd find refuge in my car. I walked out only to find left over loafs of bread from today jammed inbetween every door handle of my car, instead of in the garbage where they belong.
 
It's silly, but it really pushed me over the edge, I cried on the walk to the dumpster to throw them out and then all the way home."

Anxiety,ewltwus,t3_covnp6,1565535759.0,"I have felt the same way for a long time. I got my liscense the ""easy"" way by taking drivers ed in high school bc i knew i wouldnt pass at an actual DMV. It took me 4 years to save money and gain the courage to drive. I can remember sitting at the dealership with my SO and my family assuring me it was a good car and that I should buy it. I was soooooo scared. 
Now ive been driving for almost a year and im starting to love it. I only get really stressed when i drive to larger nearby cities, sometimes i get so stressed out that i have to sit down once im at my destination bc i feel faint. 
My friends and family think im a little weird but thats just how it is. I find that the more exposure the better when it comes to this specific trigger. 

If you have time you should practice driving there on a day off before your first day!"
