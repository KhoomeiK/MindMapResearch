 In Chapter 5 of the Big Book they wrote, ""Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way.""

We can't let drugs control us, but we have to control them, and using won't solve your problems. It will only make you broke and happy for a little while, and then you'll be broke, and sad, and in a lot of pain once again. Cannabis is a safer alternative, and can help relieve pain too, but I've come to realize that my self as an addict can't use that because then I'd be in the same place you are.

Save your money, search for a job as soon as you get to where you're going, and don't go the homeless and high route. Because in the end, you'll just be homeless and sad. Getting high won't solve your problems, only you can solve your problems. Sobriety is step one. Admitting that we are addicts, and giving yourself to a higher power will help, but only if you make it happen. Work can suck, and sobriety can suck, but it's required for a healthy, and successful life. Nobody ever got rich off using the needle to themselves, but countless amounts have saved themselves by quitting.

To help ourselves that requires some motivation, so I say checkout some motivating videos on youtube. It's easy, just type in ""motivational speeches"" and tons will pop up. Keep yourself sober, and I guarantee things will work out better for you. Don't worry about 5 days down the road so much, but focus on the now, and what you have to do to stay clean, and ""keep coming back"" (to meetings that is).

 You seem to know that only You, can truly change yourself. If you are sober, and wish to remain sober, that's probably the best thing you can do for yourself. For others, we can apologize for our mistakes, and that's all that we can do. We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it. You learned not to drink, so for your best future, you no longer drink. That's great! Really! But all we can do about the past is apologize, and move on. Keep moving forward, and good luck!"
alcoholicsanonymous,fjfkgeh,t3_fd5gd1,1583293643.0,"I did the same thing when I first went to a University and I lost some of my closest friends because of it. Now I am just working, and paying off my debts while I live with my family. They also do not understand why I struggle with alcohol, but from going to AA, I realized I can find good people at meetings who are willing to help, and be there for each other because we are all struggling alcoholics/addicts.

My greatest struggle with AA was that I struggle believing in a higher power/God, until I made some mistakes and quit my job because of it. I didn't know what I was going to do, and felt that I had lost all hope in life.

I re-applied to the company, sobered up, and started praying that they will take me back, and they did. If you sober up, and re-apply to the school or another school, maybe they will let you back. 

 I learned that carrying a water bottle with me everywhere helps with the drinking problem because whenever I crave for alcohol, I just drink more water! Water, water, and more water. Exercise, stretching, praying/meditation, slow breathing, and water are what have helped me.

I hope that you find your greater power and tell your family that you are overwhelmed and struggling in school. They might be understanding and might even want to help! I hope that this helps you, and the Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book also can help. They're usually available at meetings, and I strongly suggest reading it. Reading helps too with stress/sleep I have learned.

Peace out, and good luck brother/sister!"
alcoholicsanonymous,fjfj0qt,t3_fcyir1,1583292784.0,"I've done the same thing, but the great thing about AA is that it's a program that's open to whoever wishes to try it. Don't let your mistakes from the past control you, but be happy with the changes you choose to make. The future is ahead of us, so we have to leave the past behind us.

Good luck!"

Christianity, Islam, Judaism was imagined by a bunch of people who’s morphine/heroin receptors were lighting up from poppy seeds, so People(including Christians, Muslims, and Jews around the world started eating poppy seeds or things with poppy seeds because it was addictive and edible. Some got high, and saw stuff and would kindly give others the seeds and it spread and took over the world. We now use it and other addictive chemicals in our foods, legally because they can make money off of it, and we’re all addicts. Stand with me and take the pledge to Cannabinoids, and not opiods."
