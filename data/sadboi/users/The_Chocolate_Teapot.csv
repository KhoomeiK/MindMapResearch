Things got bad enough for me this year that I ended up in a VA hospital  psych ward for 2 weeks.  It ended up being a good thing though.  

They have really stepped up services for veterans through a new program called ""The Mission Act"".  I got the help I needed by contacting the veterans crisis line  (Posting the info here in case someone else might need it)  Text: 838255   I legit just texted and was like ""Im at the end and want to die, but dont want to die, can you help me"" and long story short, they REALLY were kind, non judgemental and very helpful.    Ended up being offered ECT treatment (electro convulsive therapy) and its been working ok for me.  Some people have miraculous results with it (im not one of those people, but hey).  I've got a PTSD/mental health diagnoses through the VA, and all care has been 100% covered.

Anyways, one vet to another, just wanted to throw that info out there, without a long ramble about MYSELF.  Feel free to contact me if you want anymore info, happy to help.

Stay strong brotha, we're here for you."

Dispensaries are ALL cash only here and they do get jacked once in awhile, but seems pretty rare as most have security and a shit ton of cameras everywhere.  Personal grows seem to be the target more.  


But yeah, being able to use THC (I dont smoke, I use RSO/concentrates only) almost cured me of drinking.   

I am a better person with THIS addiction than I was as a 24/7 drunk.


Didnt say good, mind you.  Just better."
