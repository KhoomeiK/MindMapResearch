mentalhealth,ewqnm1o,t1_ewpujz6,1565671659.0,"I can‚Äôt find a dr that will prescribe them to me.  At least not here in Alaska. It‚Äôs become this terrible thing to prescribe because people are misusing it. I can see that with Valium or Xanax but Klonopin seems more ‚Äúclinical‚Äù if you know what I mean.  It‚Äôs still a benzo tho. I‚Äôve even thought about ordering some from Canada lol. I totally know what you mean by not wanting to be a slave to it!  I wonder if there‚Äôs any research done regarding super duper long-term use. I‚Äôll have to look into that. 

160 to 180 mg a day. I have to admit I‚Äôve been there. üòè. I use to own a pub in Oregon and after they took me off the Klonopin, I picked that addiction up (yay me!). Usually vicodin, but I had a couple people who would come in daily and drink all night and pay me with pills. I had zero excuse. I had no pain other than my brain pain from not having the Klonopin. I used suboxone to taper myself off of that. And yes it was very uncomfortable, but for for me anyway, not as horrific as Klonopin.   Then again OxyContin is like 30% stronger!  That must‚Äôve been HELL for you!  Wtf was that doctor thinking!!  I can‚Äôt believe you were prescribed that much!  And why didn‚Äôt they offer you suboxone?

In the end I sold the bar and with a signature in the wrong place, I lost any gain from it financially.  SO I was left with legit PTSD from the withdrawal, no money, the aftermath of the pain med addiction AND the horror of finding out that my bf of 8 years, and the father of my twins, had been to jail in his past for rape. I was unable to cope with all this and had a nervous breakdown which is NOT fun. I‚Äôm not saying that Klonopin was the cause of it, but I know for a fact things would‚Äôve turned out differently and I could‚Äôve handled the extreme stress.  I literally went into the doc begging for help in tears (he had a med student mirroring him) and all he said was he couldn‚Äôt help me. 

Omg I‚Äôm talking about myself too much. I‚Äôm sorry. 

Just make sure they taper. I‚Äôm talking maybe even 1-2 years!  At least you‚Äôd have a goal!  There‚Äôs no reason to be in discomfort when you don‚Äôt have to be. Doctors don‚Äôt know shit about addiction or mental health issues unless they are trained in that area. Tell them what you want and don‚Äôt let them give you otherwise. It‚Äôs your health and your mind not theirs.  

May I ask what caused so much back pain?

Have you found anything in your research explaining what could be the cause of your agoraphobia and panic attacks?"
mentalhealth,ewpsemf,t3_cpi5hy,1565648222.0,"I was on Klonopin for 6 1/2 years. I started off with .5 mg a day and that‚Äôs all I ever needed and never asked to up the meds. This medicine changed my whole life. I was able to talk to people, socialize, be successful, etc. After I got off of it, everything went back to the way it was before and my life is shit.  A Dr. decided one day that I shouldn‚Äôt be taking them, apparently after benzos became a popular topic, and took me off too quickly. He halved the dose the next day for two weeks and then nothing. I cannot explain in words the utter turmoil and debilitating withdrawals I went through. This lasted for three weeks and it was pure hell. I should‚Äôve been in the hospital. I wanted to end my life so bad but I couldn‚Äôt because of my kids mostly and the physical condition I was in.  Tremors, massive anxiety, depression, unable to sleep, a feeling of screaming for something, anything, anyone to please help. Omg it SUCKED!!!  That was just the beginning. I don‚Äôt mean to scare you, I‚Äôm just saying how important it is to go on a proper taper schedule. I think 3/4 of my symptoms could‚Äôve been avoided had I gone to the ER. I probably could‚Äôve gotten some help but at that point I had zero trust in doctors and I refused to go in and be treated like an addict.  I literally thought they would intentionally make me worse. 

Now, would I start taking them again?  Yes. I live a really hard existence. It‚Äôs a daily struggle just to talk to anyone and therefor I‚Äôm just.... alone. That‚Äôs no way to live. 

The long-term affects from Klonopin I think for me, which could be completely different from others, is memory loss, like really bad.  But I drank for a long time and that most certainly didn‚Äôt help. I have talked to others on a forum and their symptoms have been more physical like tics and muscle spasms. 

I wonder If staying on the drug would be beneficial as a lifetime ritual? Some people have to take medicine all their life just to stay alive, why can‚Äôt people take something that helps with their mental state that is ongoing and debilitating to your happiness and well-being?

Sorry for the long answer and life story lol. I think what I‚Äôm saying is TAPER properly and possibly find an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety med that will help.  Maybe Buspar and Venlafaxine?  Just a suggestion. 

I hope SO MUCH you feel better soon. 

Be happy."

If it doesn‚Äôt work out at least you can move on and not waste your time obsessing about it anymore!  There‚Äôs millions of different personalities. People with their own dreams and futures and morals and world views etc...to learn about!

I think one thing I would do differently is shove myself into situations that I‚Äôm scared of. Make myself go out or make myself seek help.
