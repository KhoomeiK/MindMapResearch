lonely,fqwqgj3,t3_gkmwf1,1589714110.0,Sorry to hear about all that. It's definitely difficult when you cant speak to the ones u care about and enjoy. I hope something beautiful will brighten your day .
lonely,fqwqe44,t3_gkmxco,1589714040.0,"I can relate to what you're saying. Its hurts. But I don't think u are alone even though you feel it. We are here and as much as the world seems empty, there is beauty in a lot of simple things. I dont feel as though we will remain unloved and uncared for all our lives. We are worthy of so much more."
depression,fqwq5tn,t3_gjbwyz,1589713804.0,"Im sorry you were hurt. I know the feeling I hurt a lot too myself. I just want to say to you that there is always another day. It's weird for me, I could be feeling so shit and then just a memory of something beautiful can uplift me. It could be a vision of a beautiful beach and waves and a sun setting and being with someone you love. I don't think you are not worthy of love, you are definitely not worthless. You sound smart and compassionate. Sometimes its essential for us to let go of our expectations and just let life be but also don't lower your standards and strive to discover truth and freedom in all you do. Being your authentic self so that you can attract your authentic counterpart."

crueltyfree,fq5gtcu,t3_ggedcs,1589104856.0,well i've never heard of that. i bought a lot of different sunscreens and there was always an issue. Now I use the 100% pure green tea mineral sunscreen. I like it at first it did give my face some dryness but now its used to it and it doesnt feel dry but i do give my face breaks just so it can breathe not cause of any persisting dryness. Its smooth and easy to apply and blend. Looks fine with makeup but without makeup there is a slight white cast. Nothing as bad as some as it is slightly tinted light yellow. It smells good and has good ingredients from what I can tell. They have a stick too I might try. I like the tinted cc cream/sunscreen by andalou naturals but it gave me hives i think so i stopped using it.

well i googled bit about it seems its funded by purina and some other companies.. i checked out the guidelines and it says a food that is formulated to meet aafco profiles for all life stages must meet the minimum nutrient levels for both growth and adult maintenance. 

Which both of these brands do and also work alongside nutritionists .."
dogs,fotdrog,t1_fotdb2z,1588051028.0,Im confused I believe both of these foods meet the nutritional levels established by aafco. I have read about dcm

VeganBeauty,fomg2vs,t3_g82u41,1587888728.0,Damn I have a good one but I just checked and it contains beeswax I guess.. its mineral fusion volumizing mascara. Its nice and for me it doesnt bug my eyes. Hopefully you find one that is tho

CBD,foid9sj,t1_foi07kh,1587783983.0,tbh I dont want to vape since I quit smoking/vaping weed and have no interest in inhaling anything. They have a 500 & 1000 mg bottle as well. Should I maybe get that next time? I mean if thats the case then this shit is pricey and how can I get tinctures that'll last me a long time or at least idk a month or two without breaking the bank?
VeganBeauty,fohbgto,t1_fofl0cy,1587763181.0,have you also noticed it turns dark after a while? Idk if its because it may have gotten wet but mine always gets dark and hard. I just use weleda atm
leaves,foew0tt,t3_g6v49b,1587716732.0,all really good points i def relate to plenty. i look back on those times and realize like i was seriously so lost in this repetitive toxic isolated lonely void. i miss the ability to relax and stuff and like idk have those deep thoughts but i like being present my head feels a lot more clear my depression has dramatically improved same with my anxiety
antisocial,foeq46g,t3_g6n8ha,1587711001.0,my city is still pretty empty i can cross the road without waiting for cars to pass and having the drivers awkwardly stare at me while i wait to cross. The stars and sky looks way more nicer. Like the stars at night are like wow brighter and stuff. The silene is nice my anxiety levels are down. I enjoy a lot of things about quarantine but also am upset about not being able to see my doctor or dentist and do important health related things.
TeamSESH,fodw392,t3_g6rwtp,1587691228.0,"I am 27 from Ontario, Canada and I found bones when I was searching for a song that had thunder in the name and instead I found bones - thunder so i clicked on it and I was like hm this is good so ever since then I been listening to his music. I don't like all of his songs of course but there are a lot of really beautiful nice ones with great melodies and lyrics that are very real and emotional. I love the bass and ethereal beats as well and his style of singing/rapping/writing. I'm not really familiar with the scene or genre. I've never been to one of his concerts and I probs wouldn't go lol but I enjoy his music from the comfort of my home and also appreciate the talent of his fellow artists. I just got my first sesh merch few weeks ago lol I think he's a cool dude and his merch is pretty affordable. I'm sure his music has had an impact on my character/development but in what ways I'm not too sure."
PiercingAdvice,fo99u93,t1_fo8se4n,1587613944.0,That makes sense well get in contact with the piercer and see what they say

PiercingAdvice,fo8sasj,t1_fo8m32b,1587602801.0,Oh. I've seen others use qtips and when I used the qtip I was able to gently remove al the crust that formed. Im not sure how I can clean it without the piercing moving across unless I dab it with the gauze. Or I could just spray it with the saline and leave it I guess.
PiercingAdvice,fo8pkv6,t1_fo8ocok,1587601239.0,Wow so a mistake by the piercer?? That is bad. I am going to let her know now to touch it. Do you think if she lets it close and gets it repierced it would be better or a good idea?
PiercingAdvice,fo8mp02,t1_fo8li06,1587599584.0,The jewelry is internally threaded and the material is titanium steel. I guess she is saying she is touching it a bit.
PiercingAdvice,fo8m1et,t1_fo8hqx8,1587599207.0,Thank you my mom was cleaning it with gauze but today i cleaned it with a qtip and the neilmed solution gently and got a bit of the pus/crust out of it. I also just sprayed it with the saline spray and we let it absord instead of wiping it off as my mom was doing.
