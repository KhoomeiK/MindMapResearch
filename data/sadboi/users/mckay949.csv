CPTSD,fovi9gj,t3_g9jof5,1588101772.0,"> So do you experience CPTSD physically? 

For me the main kind of physical symptom I have is that I have a lot of tension in my body, sometimes it becomes so intense that it becomes difficult to just walk normally because my body wants to shake, and my body will move a little involuntarily. Also at times I will become overcome with rage and my heart will start racing and I will start sweating. Sometimes I'll vomit right after I started eating a meal, but this happens only occasionally, most meals I can eat without that. I have tinnitus, I imagine it is at least partially caused by the CPTSD. If feeling tired is considered a physical symptom, than add that there too.

> Where do you think it comes from and what do/did you do about it?

Do you mean what caused the CPTSD? In my case the CPTSD comes from doing treatment in a psychiatric day hospital where my psychotherapist was abusive and having a mother who forced me not to quit that treatment no matter what.

The thing I have been doing and still do to cure it is doing as much meditation I can, sometimes I'll spend the whole day meditating, and when the meditation becomes too hard (and by too hard I mean that at one point that tension in my body becomes too intense due to the CPTSD) then I'll stop and I'll go browse the internet to distract myself for a while and then go back to meditating again."
CPTSD,fovdflw,t3_g9k2gr,1588099463.0,"I have a somewhat similar experience. My experiences with school or health professionals who weren't psychiatrists or psychologists were ok, but my experiences with psychiatrists and psychologists were on average horrible, I got much worse due to the treatment, so I ended up quitting the treatments on my own and also fighting a lot with my mother due to this, because she tried to force me no matter what to do those kinds of treatments. The CPTSD I have is due to doing treatment in a psychiatric day hospital and my mother forcing me to never quit that treatment. They (the professionals and my mother to some degree) betrayed my trust a bunch of times. I ended up studying psychiatry and psychology on my own out of necessity, because since my mother wanted to force me to do treatments, and the treatments made me much worse, I needed to know how to stop her and the mental health professionals from hurting me. After a lot of nasty fights with her she stopped bugging me, so at least I stopped getting worse. I do know that other people's experiences might be the opposite, that they might go in for treatment and it might be great, but in my case I will probably never go to a psychiatrist or psychologist again because I'm already solving my emotional problems by practicing zen buddhism, so I rather not try those treatments again. I still have some anger towards the professionals that hurt me and my mother, but that anger is diminishing over time."

> Have you ever taken psychotropic medication? If yes, then how was your experience?

For the most part they were negative. Only one drug helped just a little, and another helped more with a psychosomatic pain I was having, and it wasn't the only thing that helped with the pain. All other medications I took were ineffective or ineffective with side effects. They never worked when I took them for depression. And I have tardive dyskinesia, a disease similar to parkinson's disease, due to all the medication I took. 

> What do you think of Peter Breggin's critique of psychiatry in general?

I find Peter Breggin's works interesting, I do think psychiatry is not as bad as he portrays, but his works are interesting in that you can get an idea of the risks of doing treatment if you read what he writes, a risk that sometimes people lie about it. And he is not the only source of said information.

> Isn't it just stupid to prescribe an SSRI to an already Emotionally-dulled patient? Why not Wellbutrin or something?

For me one of the main reasons to be against antidepressants would be if they didn't work better than a placebo. I've seen people who study the evidence say both that they don't work better than a placebo and that they work better than a placebo, but since I myself didn't study the trials done with antidepressants one by one to see what the evidence really says about them, I don't know who is right. If it is really true that antidepressants don't work better than a placebo, then it doesn't make any sense to prescribe them since you already know they have side effects."
