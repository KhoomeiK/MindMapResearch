relationship_advice,ewv7kj6,t1_ewunwld,1565800382.0,"That s the thing -he isnt studying, but he doesnt have a job either. He spends all day at home or with his parents on holidays. And neither of us is rich, but he definitely has more money than I do- his family went on holidays for 2 weeks meanwhile me and my parents just stay at home all year because we cant afford to travel. And when he was actually doing something, (he was in an internship a few months ago) we didnt hang out at all because he didnt have enough time. Meanwhile, me while at uni, having to wake up at 5 am and do exams and assignments, but STILL making the effort and the time (also saving up and spending money) to travel to his house and spend the afternoon with him.

I know he s not a bad person, and Im not mad at a particular event, it s just these little things that keep adding up to each other, and now whenever he doesnt even make the effort to go to his phone I just feel really disappointed and lonely.

I just love him so so so much, yknow? I just hope Im not thinking this stupidly, and overreacting to smt unreasonable yknow? I really dont want to be hurting him"
relationship_advice,ewv6upt,t1_ewuriu2,1565799941.0,"but am i being unreasonable? He s my first boyfriend so I dont have anyone else to compare it to. I just dont know if Im expecting too much. I dont even want his extreme attention, just him wanting to have lunch with me once in a while, or maybe just him having the iniciative to hang out would be nice, yknow? It feels like if I dont make the effort to hang out we would go 2 months without seeing each other, and he wouldnt even mind.

But true, it s definitely frustrating, but I really do love him and I just dont want to give up on him. That s why it feels like Im going in circles."
relationship_advice,ewunmit,t1_ewulrnl,1565786961.0,"Ig you are right, neither of us are in the wrong here. I just wish he d want to work this out as well, I feel like im hitting a wall here.

But thank you for your comment"
relationship_advice,ewunevr,t1_ewummap,1565786790.0,"Yes and he said that he feels bad about it but doesnt know how to fix it. He doesnt want to spend any money or take his parents car, so it becomes kind of hard because we obviously cant just walk. And now whenever I mention it he says that I m hurting him because I know he cant do anything about it. 

Idk like, when I was still having classes, I d have to wait literal hours in my uni’s library to then go meet him in the afternoon, since he never wanted to have lunch with me -because, then again, effort. Whenever I asked if we could have lunch together cause i was bored waiting alone, he always said ‘oh but i dont have lunch for you, im just gonna heat something up in the microwave’ even though i could very cleary bring something over from the cafeteria. And when I mentioned that to him he replied ‘but then I d have to go pick you up and I ll do that already in the afternoon’.

I know he s kinda lazy and sometimes i feel like im exaggerating, but it does get lonely whenever he just stops replying because he doesnt even feel like texting anymore. Idk, am i asking for too much? am i exaggerating?"

Next month I’m going to ask my doctor- thank you so much for helping me decide :)"
medical_advice,eudy2ml,t1_euc941u,1563730426.0,"Im not sure yet actually, but the disposable ones seem a little wasteful to me so maybe the ones i could reuse would be better? (i havent done enough research tho and my optom. appointment is in a month)

Im just really afraid of doing something wrong and then ending up in the hospital with some huge infection or smt - but maybe that s kind of unrealistic? welp I hope so at least haha. But id love to give them a try, specially since i feel like im gonna like them better than my glasses
Have contacts given you any trouble so far? 

Im gonna check with my doctor anyways, but thank you for your feedback!"

CasualConversation,etgaaux,t1_etga1gl,1562786865.0,"Probably so, I dont believe she knows there s the “hot” part of it, with all the balancing and muscle control.

CasualConversation,etga239,t1_etg9yng,1562786725.0,right tho??? I kinda think that doctor was highly underestimating it
CasualConversation,etg9he1,t1_etg98on,1562786398.0,"tbh I just do a mix depending on how Im feeling on that day (I mainly do it at home - yoga with adrienne is my favorite channel for it on youtube). If I feel particularly tired or sad I ll just do a soft one, but if im feeling in a funk or just contempt I ll do a hard ass one. That s how Ive always done it, but that doctor seemed to dismiss it all together, that s why the question"

mentalhealth,erygzvq,t1_erya7sw,1561408335.0,then wouldnt it be easier to send that woman to the actual psychiatrist instead of just kicking her out? I still dont know why she wasnt a valid patient
mentalhealth,erx8alu,t3_c4i02g,1561376532.0,"Omg right tho?? The other day i was with my dad in the emergency room at our local hospital (he fell and broke his head) and there was a woman laying down on these chairs and crying. At first I didnt think much of it, but then she started screaming and shuffling about and you could clearly tell she had some psychological problem (she smelled, some of her clothes were inside out, she kept losing her shoes, she threw tantrums on the floor, etc.) The thing is she would cling onto anyone passing by crying and saying ""i need a psychiatrist, someone get me a psychiatrist, it hurts everywhere"". And i kid you not, every nurse or other hospital employee just told her to sit back down or to go home, and they knew her name so she was obviously a very familiar face around there. This woman was screaming at the top of her lungs that she needed a PSYCHIATRIST, and of course she wasnt in the right department cause it was the emergency room, but everyone just ignored her and told her to go home cause she was upsetting the other patients. Idk I get that doctors and nurses and all are very busy but why isnt there even just one psychiatrist in the emergency room along with the other doctors? I ve spent enough time in there to know that people cry A LOT when they find themselves stuck in a hospital bed, I mean who would blame them. Just seems kind of insensitive to brush it off as if emotional damage isnt as important as physical damage."
