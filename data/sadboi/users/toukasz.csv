Ipseity disturbance? Not even the so-call professional who was responsible for diagnosing me ever heard of the term, even though it’s linked on the main wiki page of schizophrenia... And it’s reported the self-disorder causes more suffering to the patient than the canonical aspects of psychosis itself.

As of now, as far as I’m aware, the best we got is therapy (learning to cope and live with it, untie any unneeded distress) and medication (manage the positive symptoms). True negative symptoms (not secondary negative symptoms due to say depression or general poor management of values) are resistive to treatment.. I haven’t heard of any approaches that are reliably effective, much of it is still experimental. Ipseity disturbance??

schizophrenia,fqcr7zo,t3_gi3kw5,1589266300.0,"How long have you been experiencing these potential signs and symptoms for? Something to keep eye on is subtle and significant changes in behaviour over the months or yrs.

Just the matter that both your father and grandfather faced schizophrenia puts you at significantly greater risk for it compared to the general population. Since there’s a strong genetic component, even tho the majority has no family history.

What you describe does sound quite prodromal (early pre-psychotic stage to psychosis). Social withdrawal, dpdr, random voices inside your head that are not your own (that’s already a symptom, tho from the sounds of it not fully blown and rather latent since you noted it’s when tryna fall asleep) are all relevant indicators for being markedly at-risk.

Have you looked up ‘basic symptoms’ of schizophrenia? And ipseity disturbance as well (anomalous self experience unique to schizo-spectrum disorders).. it can help further clarify your prognosis, but there’s also a responsibility and sound state of mind called for when making that judgement. It’s going to take a lot of introspective work and thinking. Feels to me it might be worth meeting with a doctor who knows what they’re talking about, tell them about your risk factors and various disturbances.

To note it’s unlikely a shrink’d prescribe you antipsychotics before emergence of florid psychosis. (If meds are even right for you.)

Even with all that said, none of us or the doctors can grantee the diagnosis till an acute episode is observed. The best tools can only predict this with at best about 50-70% probability.

Have you looked into schizotype? It’s common to have relatives of schizophrenics who exhibit schizo-like behaviour but not to a clinical level. If otherwise your life isn’t all too effected by it and functionality is maintained, you may reflect that better.

Also.. don’t take psychedelics (really any illicit drugs in general), I think you know why :/

This is not even a coin flip here. You might still be able to doge the trainwreck that’s barrelling towards you in slow motion... unless you *want* to worsen the schizophrenia.

The first appointment with gp said the concerns I speak sounds psychotic and sent a letter to my gp back in hometown, but he just treated me for depression and didn't seem to read any of my previous notes(?), the CBT person also cancelled our sessions saying the symptoms I describe sounds beyond the scope of their specialty and referred me to early intervention for psychosis, when she ""assessed"" me first seemed to had little real understanding of psychosis when I questioned her and assured me absolutely I wasn't facing psychotic symptoms.. then I got referred back to CBT. I'll be meeting him this upcoming wednesday and honestly fear getting kicked out again to someone else. I'm far from the best communicator, I can't speak and muddle everything. In the moment best I can do is follow along what they say and makes standing up for myself all that much more difficult.

To start with:

http://www.schizophrenia.com/earlysigns.htm#

Then I’d also look up basic symptoms of schizophrenia (subjective experiences recognised as “off” by patients):

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_symptoms_of_schizophrenia

And eventually current understanding into self-disorder (ipseity disturbance):

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-disorder

https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/40/6/1300/1853109

“*In schizophrenia spectrum disorders, this basic self-hood seems to be challenged, unstable and oscillating, resulting in often alarming and alienating experiences, frequently dating back to childhood or early adolescence. The patient feels ephemeral, lacking core identity, profoundly (yet ineffably) different from others, and alienated from the social world. There is a diminished sense of existence, distortions of first-person perspective with a failing sense of “mineness” of the field of awareness (e.g., “my thoughts have no respect for me”, “it seems as if my thoughts were not mine”), spatialization of the experiential contents (e.g., thoughts being experienced as located, extended, thing-like entities), and inadequate “ego-boundaries”, with deficient sense of privacy of one’s inner world. Correlatively, there is a sense of lacking immersion in the world and inadequate nonreflective (immediate) grasp of self-evident meanings (eg, “why is the grass green?”), as well as a general hyperreflective stance (e.g., “I only live in my head”, “I always observe myself”).*”

I happened to write an answer to this exact question too:

https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-of-becoming-schizophrenic-1/answer/Fubuki-Numachi

With the proper place of mind in judgement and tools used to assess psychotic risk, you can predict onset of schizophrenia by about 50-70% probability months to even yrs before the acute phase.

Maybe in the mean time I’d look up ‘Basic Symptoms (BS)’ and ipseity disturbance / self disorder. It’s roughly grouped and generalised into lists of experiences commonly associated with schizophrenia. You can, upon honest self analysis, see whether you relate with these items and how strongly so as to judge whether you’re at high risk for psychosis. Either you’d jump up saying “yes, this is exactly what I mean” or (hopefully) you won’t relate at all but from say just voices.

There’s a population (tho not very big) of healthy people who also experiences voices but are otherwise healthy and usually don’t find them distressing, sometimes even helpful.
