It’s been helpful in the workplace where I’m now working a job that’s actually two positions in one, but no one actually expects me to do like 80 hours. I’m expected to find a way to craft my own role and determine priorities myself. Grad school really prepared me for this kind of thing, for “settling” kind of. The 80/20 rule was mentioned so many times and it totally applies. Just do 20% of the work but make it the most important stuff, then it seems like it’s 80% done.

Staying in an unhealthy relationship for too long might be an aspie thing. In general, we aspies try to avoid conflict and change. I’ve found a good deal of secretiveness to be common due to people reacting poorly to the way I do things, so I’m anxious if I’m observed. That might relate somehow."

However, I found that over time I got really good at working with it. This skill really translates well to crowded yoga rooms! Also I find my automatic adjustment skills handy when doing yoga outside where I might not want to get sandy/muddy.

* Make the environment better. Turn off lights, light scented candles, put on their music or bring headphones or earplugs, bring their comfort food. 

* Encourage them to engage in their special interest. Maybe get them a gift that relates to it, a new tool or project. 

* Go to the swings together. 

* Do yoga together. 

* Put on a guided relaxation and sit next to them. 

* Clear out the environment of clutter. Take out the trash, clear the surfaces, do laundry. 

* Bring them their pet and a toy and treats. 

* If they’re open to it, encourage them to take a shower and have a clean towel with fresh comfortable clothes out for them. 

* Tell them exactly what to expect from you for the next few hours or days. “Tonight I’m thinking we get carry out from __ restaurant, you like the __ food there. then maybe we can watch __ movie until __:00, then bed. I’m feeling sympathetic and loving, and I don’t need anything from you tonight.” 

* Make sure they’re hydrated and up to date on meds. 

* Tell them to touch you instead. Make “you” be the sensory toy. Then, don’t move, but verbally indicate you’re happy. Back rub, chew toy, squishy, soft squeezy, warm. 

* Get into a hidey hole together. Pillow fort, closet, actual tent. I like to pretend it’s a blizzard and we need to hide to stay warm and conserve our strength. 

* Leave them alone for 24 hours, and tell them you’re leaving them alone for 24 hours. At 6pm, say “I’m sorry you’re having a hard time. I decided to go visit my sister and her kids, I haven’t seen them in a while. I won’t text you until 6pm so you can get some peace. You can text me if you need me, but please, take your space.

You’ll get direct and practical advice from autistic people, but from personal experience I’ve found the partner-geared boards can be very toxic. If you appreciated my directness, you’ll be welcomed on the autistic boards. 

You should know you’re not the only person who’s gone through trauma that is then attracted to someone autistic. It can be very attractive to find someone who is so transparent and independent. Someone deeply kind. I’ve heard it said many times. 

Oh and since you mentioned you know you have a tendency to read into things - the secret to getting relief from this is also mindfulness. Try to notice your triggers for getting emotionally aroused. If there are certain things your mind always seems to pick out and fret over, start to notice the pattern. Then when it inevitably happens again, try to become an observer rather than being “in” it so much. That will help you recognize how you tend to react to his nonverbals and in a short time it will lessen their impact on you. 

Post to the aspergers board, but maybe post a separate post like “can you all help me understand how I can not take things personally? What have your spouses’ strategies been?” And in a separate post, “for anyone who has had sensory issues interfere with your sex life, what have you done to work through it?” Direct questions like that will get you more comments.

I do want more sex so for us it’s a matter of dealing with the other issue - Is he dealing with sensory problems when you try to have sex? There are practically no resources on this and we are all so different. It’s so important that you **take him at his word** on things that have so much nonverbal communication. You have to try to put on blinders to the behaviors that in another partner would “mean” something more. 

My wife often despairs at sex and thinks I’ve given up when really I’m still diligently working through my issues. I have to remind her the current state of our sex lives is not my goal or something I’m ok with, I want a lot more I just cannot get my body to cooperate.

I regularly wake her up gently and I often make her breakfast. So, right away, I am aware of so many miscommunication moments happening. I know her, though, and I know if I were to say “what is it about the breakfasts we have together now that aren’t giving you what you need from me in the mornings?”, she would take that as though I’m arguing with her. I don’t think SHE is wrong in her loneliness or needs. I do think she’s asking a non-literal question while insisting that she is indeed being direct. 

She refuses to hear me out by interrupting me or, after her emotions get to be too much, she will tell me to stop talking. We are both allowed this “pause” signal, but we are bad at coming back and finishing the conversation when we are calmer.

Generally I am truly kind and respect her and her needs, so nearly always when she is getting hurt by what I’m saying it’s because she isn’t getting my message. We don’t actually disagree about content. We just can’t seem to *speak*. 

We are trying writing back and forth which is often much better for me. More and more she’s opening up to different strategies like that. For example when I first tried writing out my thoughts on a tough topic in a letter to her, she saw this long note left out for her as a hostile gesture in and of itself. It’s like this at first with all of the strategies we’ve tried. She gets so caught up on the process of struggling to communicate. It’s hard for her not to get derailed in an emotional side track that’s based on untrue interpretations. She struggles to withhold judgment on my message all the way to the end of what I have to say. I try to get to the point to shorten that agony for her. It’s hard for me to know how to spit out my main point.

I need to be able to clarify what she is asking, but in doing so, I communicate to her things I don’t intend. To your point, however, I would argue it is fair to request that a spouse of someone autistic would say the words “I need more attention” if that’s what she needs. 

My goal with this post is to gain wisdom from people who’ve dealt with brains wired like mine. Has this happened to you?"

raisedbyborderlines,ev97l33,t3_cipztw,1564310422.0,"I’ve been reading “parents of estranged children” forums when I forget why I don’t talk to my mother anymore. 

I got a job offer yesterday and was excited so I texted my dad, then chose not to text my mother because I know she always, without fail, makes me regret reaching out. Of course dad told her (he doesn’t understand the issues), so she texted me anyways, congratulating me for getting a job and revealing once again she does not know what it is that I do by guessing incorrectly what it is. Ofc being passive aggressive for sharing with my dad, the one who does actually care about what I’m doing in my career. 

Those things don’t seem memorable enough to worry about in the long term. But it’s *every time*. I reach out and I don’t get what I hope for. I don’t have a “mom” in her."
aspergers,ev5uw83,t1_ev1i3qq,1564239018.0,"> If you can't get your point across, tell her about that when you're NOT arguing, and figure out how to best have these conversations.

This is essentially my entire married life right now, except we can’t actually talk about the conversations without arguing. Reliably, soon after the topic of communication is raised, it is a fight. Therefore, there is no way to discuss how “I rarely get my point across” outside of an argument. 

It’s impossible to know what you don’t know, but without fail she eventually interprets my clarifying questions as attacks. She needs to improve on controlling her emotional responses. There is only so much I can do to match my tone to my meaning. I feel like I’m bending over backward to try to do it but “trying harder” doesn’t actually improve performance.

She isn’t good about defining what she wants or how specifically I could meet her needs. And I’m so bad at guessing what’s wrong, and she doesn’t want me to.

aspergers,ev1flk9,t1_ev0n5je,1564157444.0,"She was dissatisfied with me after our recent move, which I think was eye opening for her in terms of the massive gaps I have in my ability to .. function, I guess. To cooperate. I think she’s afraid to give me honest feedback about some things because I get so discouraged. I’m trying to get better in all these ways and take feedback more openly. 

I asked her about these forums and she said she hates them and avoids them. She seems disgusted by the way the women seem to hate their husbands and blame them for their autistic children. My wife seems to genuinely admire me for what I’m able to achieve, but I think it took more time for her to have it sink in the things I am not capable of. For example when we went camping recently and were setting up the tent it became more obvious how I can’t follow verbal instructions, and she was surprised by how impossible that sort of thing is for me. 

I think in the past she didn’t think she would mind picking up my slack, but in time I think she’s getting sick of it. For a while there, she was enabling me too much to avoid adult responsibilities to free me up to just earn as much money as I could. Now that’s not working anymore because I lost my job for one thing, but also there was a power imbalance in the relationship where I depended too much on her errands and organizational skills and she depended too much on my income. We are correcting for this now, but the conversations about it are not smooth and rarely (if ever) do I get my whole point across to her. 

I actually just got a job offer this morning, so now we can find a therapist and hopefully one that specializes in autism."

I think it got worse over time. I am ashamed of my natural, slack facial expression because it reminds me of my dad’s which is an intrusive thought for me lately (vivid imagery of my dad’s head transposed on my (female) body). If I am around her and not “performing” it seems to make my wife nervous. But we struggle to talk openly about this because she doesn’t understand me a lot of the time and thinks I mean offense when I do not. In order not to offend her I feel like I have to pull out all the communication skills I can muster up, which still doesn’t even always work. 

I know she rationally yearns for me to feel comfortable enough to let go of all masking around her. Yet when I do it she always interprets my face and tone of voice as angry or attacking her. She gets stuck in trying to engage in rational arguments when really her reactions are purely based in emotion. So, back on the mask goes. It seems like the more time goes on the more she’s able to detect my masking, and then she seems to think I’m trying to hide something. It’s really hard to figure out. I know she has sincere appreciation for me in who I am, but she’s so often misreading me and getting hurt by her misinterpretations that I fear the relationship is damaging for her regardless of my intent."

AspiePartners,euq9lrf,t3_cezspm,1563973833.0,"I’m seeing these comments as not particularly helpful, just condemning your spouse. It sounds like she gets super caught up on specific words that come through in an apology, and clearly she needs to reign it in. However you might benefit simply understanding what she actually wants. If she wants you to read a book about it, then maybe you should tell her to get a book about it and then read it together. The book would probably also have information in there about when it’s not reasonable to expect and apology, and that might give your wife something to think about as she reflects on her own behavior.
