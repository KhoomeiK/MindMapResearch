I kinda felt like he disliked the game for it's very purpose. There was suppose to be exploration.  Strong heavy narritive and cut scenes. Good voice acting.  It wasn't supposed to be a full blown action game like dmc. There was supposed to be stealth and scarcity to add to the feel of trying to survive in this world. 

Like how dumb would I look said ahh I hate FFXV because the world is too big and you have to Level up. Or I hate MGS because too much sneaking

It's like that's the point of those games. Ffxv is an RPG. Mgs is a stealth tactical espionage game. Last of us is a  third person strongly  narritive driven game with some stealth and exploration.

AmItheAsshole,foc3b6f,t3_g6l1l5,1587666621.0,"Makes me think of that ridiculous statement

""Black people can't be racist"" 

I also feel like most people here just don't understand how difficult it is to have a racist relative and Knowing there is nothing you can do to change their mind. Their wrongness is deeply embedded in who they are, going against that in their mind would be against them as a person and they will 100%of the time not handle that well. And often times it just makes thing worse and more tense.

All the people saying the husband is An asshole for ""tolerating it"" ( he was ignoring cuz he knew there was nothing he can do to change her mind. You can't fix stupid.) probably don't have much experience with people like this so it's easy to step back and say that from the outside looking in

Wait till your daughter is older to tell her what a horrible and illogical person grandma is."

Yeah and everyone can be slut or jump off the bridge doesn't mean she should do it just to fit in? What kind of fucking dumb logic is going on on that guy's head

Idk man sometimes I worry about the younger Generation. They seem to have no boundaries and both socially and sexually indept

Even taking dick selfies weird me out. I never done it because honestly I don't have the confidence or a good camera and dude once it's up on the internet that shit stays there forever. I don't know of that picture is gonna get shared somewhere. You never know."
unpopularopinion,fobfe7b,t3_g6hhjc,1587659231.0,"I 100% agree with everything you said and I'm not gay lol of patreon all that bullshit is just a way to exploit people for their money by taking advantage of them. Why should a thot twtich streamer get like 10K a month for basically not really contributing to society? (amouranth gets paid that much around ) I work with dogs and cats and don't get paid that much. Doesn't that seem a little off to you?

I also feel like all that stuff isn't a good thing for people with chronic masturbation issues, porn addictions, and impulse control problems. Maybe that's just my point of view

Everytime I see someone post something like ""don't buy her of it's a scam blah blah blah"" when is it not q scam? Your paying for something that was very easily created. Nude photos. They aren't rocket science. It's just point at your junk and press capture. Why would you think that's worth it?"

 Never seen it that smegma crap whatever it is cuz I clean myself and as someone here mentioned a about guys not pulling skin back to clean, I do pull the skin back when cleaning.
I'm against anything that has a religious reason because it's not  my beliefs and I have  no religion and plan to keep it that way.


As the sex part I mean I no way of knowing for sure but I 100% prefer sex without a condom. The feeling with a condom just can't compare. Never had a tearing issue or anything"

With the gummies it helps me fall asleep fast and stay asleep uninterrupted. I don't wake up hours before my alarm like usual, I just stay asleep the whole time.

I still feel like most of my sleep problems can be solved if I excercise more and went sober. I know thc affects your quality of sleep and prevents you from dreaming"
