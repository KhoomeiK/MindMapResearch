The best thing we can do is to not worry about what has happened in the past & not comparing ourselves to other people because most people at 20 years old donâ€™t have everything figured out in this life. I know for sure most people are feeling lost even those who are in school or working in a job. Society expects us to be this at 20 and that we should be doing this and that but that should not be the case. We should just focus on the present moment and be grateful for everything life has to bring to us everyday of our lives. Life is too short. The strive to improve ourselves everyday should be our main priority and that we should do anything we can to make our future brighter no matter what. Life is hard, but we should never give up. Keep going no matter what happens. Happy birthday and take care."

depression,epfzdu1,t3_buqar9,1559204661.0,"You should continue because you have something to prove. To prove that you are greater than depression and you will fight through it like a real man. You can overcomes this and I know you will live to tell the tale. Use your hardships to make you stronger. Donâ€™t let anybody think you are failure, what matters is what you think about yourself. Surround yourself with positive people as much as possible because your environment can directly affect what you think. Be yourself and if people dislike it otherwise, then move on and ignore because caring about what they think is a waste of time. True happiness can be found only in yourself. Figure out what you can control and what you cannot control and you will be much happier believe me. You are not a failure. Take care and keep fighting. Hope this helped. 

Here is a quote that may help:

We cannot always choose our circumstances, but we can also choose to respond to them. 

-Epictetus"
depression,epfyyfr,t3_buqgpk,1559204225.0,I really suggest that you donâ€™t go considering your situation.  Your health is much more important.

depression,epdrnz7,t1_epdl298,1559172407.0,"Just donâ€™t give up man. You are better than your problems. Donâ€™t let depression control you, I know you are much stronger than this. Whatever you do, stay positive and hopeful. If you donâ€™t want to make anything in this life, how bout helping others going through the same thing. I am sure that you can use your experience to help other people going through a similar thing or worse. I think the reason why most people are going through depression is because some people donâ€™t have a purpose. I think it is up to us to find purpose and I am sure every single one of us can create our own. Donâ€™t compare yourself to others as well because that is sure gonna bring you down. I suggest hanging out with positive people who have a possible outlook on life. I donâ€™t know too much about your situation but all I know is that you are better than your depression. Do not let it define you. We are human after all and we go through ups and downs but you have to change your perspective on things if you want to change yourself. Please donâ€™t lose hope. If other people can go overcome this so can you. Your life has meaning, itâ€™s up to you to find it, not others. I surely hope this helped and Iâ€™ll do anything I can to make sure you never lose to this. Stay strong dude."
