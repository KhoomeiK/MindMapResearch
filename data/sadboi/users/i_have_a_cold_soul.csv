As for the reasons to live- that's something I'm still figuring out myself. I think maybe that's a reason to live, to find out what your purpose is. Then again, it doesn't have to be so deep. Could be something as simple as wanting to hear your favourite song again, or look at the trees, or smell fresh air. Small things like that are completely valid, and can get you along."

I responded to your post before and so I think I'll copy paste it here so you can see why I think you're a good person 

[Let's work through these one by one.
>Almost falsely accused my bully of rape (never went through with it)

People have thoughts all the time. A lot of the time, they don't like the thoughts their thinking. But, the main difference between people who act on these thoughts and you is that you didn't do it. For whatever reason, you didn't do that and that makes you a good person.

>tried to poison my dog but intentionally failed

I've seen a lot of your posts here. I saw the whole story leading up to the time you actually tried. You were struggling with those voices so much and you held them off for so long. That's something impressive, I know how bad voices like that can get. And not only did you hold them off for so long, you also intentionally failed. You didn't mean those actions, and you fixed the mistake. It's okay, and that means you aren't a horrible person.

>Tried to force one of my friends into being in a relationship with me even though he was clearly uncomfortable

'tried' is the keyword here. You aren't doing that anymore, so while maybe it wasn't a good thing to do, it doesn't matter now. You've stopped. The past is in the past and we all make mistakes. You're only human.

>Intentionally spoiled a movie for people for a stupid cheap laugh

You know what, who cares now? Spoilers are a big part of the Internet, and so it might have happened anyway.  You've recognised it wasn't the best thing to do and you've learned. Acknowledging mistakes is a hard thing to do, and admitting when you're in the wrong shows you regret it. So well done for that. 

>Having people do things for me even though I can easily do them myself

What sort of things? And I'm sure you haven't forced anyone, maybe you asked for them to be done but it's okay. If you're looking to improve yourself, maybe try and do more things for yourself, if that makes you feel better. Though, this doesn't make you a terrible person. A lot of people do this. 

>Insulting people without thinking about what I’m saying first.

You're a teenager. This is what teenagers do. They talk without thinking. Though, again, now you've realised this, it shows you regret it. Which means you don't mean any of the things you've said. You're not a terrible person at all.

>I used to lie about myself in order to seem for interesting a few years ago

This is a lot more common than you think. It's a natural human instinct to want to come across as interesting to people. However, once you learn to be more happy within yourself and find a group of people who do love you for who you are, this isn't needed anymore. Be yourself, you're a good person, and the only one who is being too harsh here is you, not giving yourself a break. 

The fact you feel like this shows you regret. And that shows you've changed. You are not a terrible person. 
We care because you deserve people to be there for you. Please try and reach out for some professional help. I know it's scary but it will help make these thoughts more manageable. Let someone in who can truly help. Just give it a try and see if it makes a difference, okay?] 

We want you here, and that's because you are valued and valid and we don't want you to suffer. But suicide is never the answer to these problems. Maybe it takes less effort to, but then your problems are not truly solved. They are merely passed on and also, you will not feel better. 

Please, you can get through this and we are all with you.

I am a teenager who is on the Internet way too much, and as long as I'm okay enough myself ill message you. I care. I'm sorry to hear about that person, though I understand.

TeenageSuicideWatch,fn2nl7n,t1_fn1e92o,1586595822.0,"Ah right I see. I think it sounds like maybe he's kind of insecure himself, if his experiences have to be said when you're not doing great either. I'm sorry he's doing that, but I promise you your experiences are valid no matter how much anyone tries to belittle them. Working on communication is good, but remember it's never all your fault.

I'm sorry about your friend too, I didn't get to say goodbye either and it's pretty sad. Again, the same as you, we knew she was going to go back at the end of the year but didn't know it was that soon. Keep in touch, and it does get easier as time goes on. If you wanted to rant or vent about anything my dms are open and all that.

I totally understand there with parents. Mine are extremely similar and so I do get how awful it feels when you can't even tell the people who are supposed to help and support you how you feel. Your feelings are all valid and while I'm not a professional by any means, if you wanted to talk more I would be happy to listen. They are not right. Depression isn't just the stereotypical laying in bed, bad grades, never happy. Smiling is a lot different from feeling truly content.

I'm sorry to hear about that attempt. That sounds rough and even more so that no one knows. I'm glad you're still around, and remember things are always changing and you won't be stuck with these peoplw forever."
TeenageSuicideWatch,fn2n4dd,t1_fn20q90,1586595290.0,"Would you be more comfortable In DMs? Or here, whatever is best for you. I'd like to listen if you want to talk."
TeenageSuicideWatch,fn0yd1t,t3_fydisq,1586551155.0,"Hello there. What's been going on? I truly do understand that feeling, but do you want to talk about things?"
TeenageSuicideWatch,fn0xw1u,t3_fykjt7,1586550890.0,"Hey, what's up? Would you like to talk about it?"
TeenageSuicideWatch,fmzacit,t3_fxbllo,1586512736.0,"Hey there. I totally understand where you're coming from with this, I feel the same way. Getting out of bed is a chore and my family doesn't treat me in a good way, constantly putting me down and like you said, I don't feel like I'm truly a part of them either. They tend to focus on the negatives, which sounds like your parents too.

Try to remember this doesn't last forever, this period of your life. You can get away from toxic households and live the way you wish. That could be a point in living, to get away from places that put you down.
It isn't forever.

However, I know that information and knowledge won't help you now. So until you don't have to deal with them anymore, you could try staying in your room as much as possible, or trying to find new hobbies that would help pass the time. As well if you'd like to vent or get anything off your chest feel free to message me.

I'm sorry you're going through a lot right now, and I hope it looks up soon."
TeenageSuicideWatch,fmz9ojr,t3_fybrq3,1586511952.0,"Hey friend, I'm sorry to hear about all that's going on.
First of all, does your boyfriend know the extent of how you're feeling? Have you straight up said you're suicidal or? Because maybe he just needs reminding of the fact you're really not doing well right now. You mentioned his life isn't easy either, so maybe he's just a little bit preoccupied right now and hasn't realised he's not paying enough attention to you. That's not me making excuses by the way, I'm just suggesting maybe he hasn't noticed. If he still isn't understanding, maybe see if you can talk to him and say if things aren't working you might have to consider moving on, however hard that is. And I also understand all too well about the friend situation, one of my closest friends recently had to go back to Canada (im in the UK) because of the coronavirus and the borders shutting. It really hurts and I know while you have messages and facetime, it's not the same as a hug in real life. Try to stay in touch and go visit them when you can. It gets easier with time.

I have been there with feeling like you just want to die, or wanting to feel like someone would care if you did, so I really do understand. I'm still in that position now. But if you can just try and take each day as it comes, and see if you can talk to someone about it who can help. I don't know if you mentioned, (apologies if you did and I'm just blind) but do your parents or caregivers know about these feelings? Or anyone really? Getting someone elses perspective helps quite a bit, though I understand how scary that is, making that conversation.
My DMs are always open if you want to talk, and if you have discord or something I can send you my tag. Hope things improve for you soon."
raisedbynarcissists,fmvttbk,t1_fmvt194,1586430641.0,You too! :)
raisedbynarcissists,fmvm588,t3_fx077u,1586422052.0,"She sounds exactly like my mother. She asked where she went wrong, while on the verge of tears when I was 5 or 6. I know what you mean, it hurts and it's not something you should have to hear from a caregiver. This sounds exactly like my situation. I'm sorry you're going through this."

Edit- I don't live there but this is if you haven't had those languages already. If you have - then I hope she has a lovely birthday :]"
TeenageSuicideWatch,fltkqc5,t3_fr2r14,1585477100.0,"Hey there, I know exactly what you're going through. My situation is pretty much the same in what they tell me, but you're right sometimes I know it's in my head but I can still hear it in a way and it's just- frustrating and I wish they'd stop too.
Would you like to talk some more about it?"
AmItheAsshole,flalr16,t3_fnoghs,1584986370.0,"NTA. You're perfectly entitled to feeling comfortable at work, and it's no surprise that you dislike it, even if you weren't in a stable and happy relationship. Maybe have another chat with your boss and say its still happening? Best of luck with your situation."
TeenageSuicideWatch,fl932p4,t3_fnavvn,1584939434.0,"Hey there friend. The quarentines are no doubt a change. Different people have different opinions about staying home, I guess. I do prefer to stay in my house but I'll go outside if someone invites me, and sometimes I will invite people to come out with me. I think your 'friends' should find someone else-- you're worth having someone to be able to listen to your problems, and actually care about you. I'm sorry things are rough right now."
TeenageSuicideWatch,fl92rqg,t3_fnb4bc,1584939160.0,"Thanks for the update. Try and stay busy with your camping, that'll be fun and give you something to try and keep your focus on. Maybe try picking up a new hobby, if you can? It could give you something to do when you feel your thoughts spiral. And I'm sorry to hear about your panic attacks, they're scary and are unpleasant I know. If you wanted someone to talk to I don't mind :)"
TeenageSuicideWatch,fl92kxa,t3_fndwvh,1584938994.0,"Hey there. I had a rough night with hallucinations too, my head was real loud and i saw shadows and flashes of light. You arent alone in this, and i know how scary they are. Try to relax, take deep breaths and maybe listen to some good music to take your mind of things as best as possible. It's going to be alright. Would you like to talk about anything more?"
selfharm,fk192g8,t1_fk12ri1,1583774887.0,"I'm not the person who you're replying to here, but I thought I'd share what 'waves of urges' means to me.
The whole need to self harm is like a sudden wave, than hits you. Maybe you expected it, like you became triggered by something, or maybe you didn't really expect it. For me, when an urge hits, it's like a burning all through my veins and I'm itching just to cut. And not giving in to that is like surpressing a cough. If you can make it through those waves, you can usually stay clean. There's a good app I recommend called 'Calm Harm' which has a lot of different distractions/techniques/coping mechanisms to help you 'ride the wave' and stay clean. It's helped me a lot and was recommended by one of my close friends.
I hope that helped a little."
AmItheAsshole,fk0uznj,t1_fk0uve5,1583766747.0,Okay. Maybe this is his way of trying to make a joke of something you both have trouble with?
AmItheAsshole,fk0uri9,t3_ffvzw6,1583766605.0,INFO - did he know about your insecurity? And also I would think about his age. Is he really mature enough to understand that it can be insensitive to make comments (sarcastic or not) about insecurities?
AmItheAsshole,fk07qcn,t3_ffrynp,1583745909.0,"NTA. You're a good person for considering how your kid would feel. Sure, pictures are great, but all over social media? Less so, imo. And yes, I would ask her kindly to take it down, since you're right the baby can't consent."
AmItheAsshole,fk07kbm,t3_ffrz6x,1583745671.0,"NTA, In my opinion. You have your reasons for not wanting to enable others to smoke, and he needs to respect that. Plus it seems like he flew off the handle a little bit there, if it was that big of a deal he should have gone and gotten some himself."
