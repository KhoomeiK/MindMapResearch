AncientAliens,forbo8v,t3_g91bxy,1588009504.0,"My opinion is that the Genesis story is completely symbolic (I think most here probably agree).

Here are some of the meanings that I believe are hidden behind the symbolism:

* Adam - Superego, moral and ethical constraints
* Eve - Ego, satisfies conscience and natural desires
* Lucifer - Id, mortal desires and appetites
* Fruit - Several Meanings; sex, become a mortal human, etc.
* Cherubim & a Flaming Sword - veil of forgetfulness as to how we got here
* Serpent Eating Dust on Its Belly - Belly = Mortal Appetites, Dust = never being filled by mortal appetites
