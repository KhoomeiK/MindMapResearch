If you want to compete in who spends more be my guest but I'll say this again. Don't encourage people to buy a illusion because in the end the same people will remain on the top.


But don't get me wrong, if these purchases helps you to rank a little higher and makes you feel good that is great. If you find value in 20€$ bonds that's also great.

Why do I say this? Because in this game there are only whales and Syr's lunch players. What do you classify as dolphin or minnow in this game? 

Not arguing about what is more valuable to you or me but assuming that light spenders should jump to this ""deal"" just because it's ""worth it"" it just doesn't seems ""fair"".

There is another gacha I play and with the same value I would spend on 400 iris from these sales I buy a bundle with a guaranteed high rarity unit that don't need bonds or nothing of the sorts to enjoy it's full potential and gives me premium currency to do at least 2 pulls on high value banners or even 4 on collab banners.

Unfortunately there is no dolphins or minnows in Danmemo. I know you will say that is not true but someone here already said that this is not worth it and it looked like someone who was willing to buy.

I may very well be just a f poor guy but I really classify any purchase made in this game a luxury. And for my understanding luxuries are for whales only.

This is great for whales and whales only. Having to pay 20 euros for a guaranteed unit or bond is not for dolphins and minnows for sure.

You can judge me at will but I rather keep buying Syr lunch and not starve in my daily life.

Edit: By the way, they should be ashamed for still practicing these prices in a time like this. They are profiting even more by not paying actors for their voices.

If people want to clear harder content quickly and consistently, getting the best they can is obviously the best route to take and in those cases I encourage to trade if it's what they really want. In cases where people still have doubts even when other players have described how good cards are I question if the person just don't see it's appeal because it has better options.

That's where my ""make your own meta"" comes in. If I know that I have better options or equivalent and if the card doesn't mean nothing or much too me and I know how to compare it with others why should I have doubts??

Where I read about said levels people states that members from those fam were already higher level than Ottarl at a young age, probably around their 17, 18.

Of course exploring more the dungeon than others always helps but even so they had to be extremely strong to take on those 2 other quests.

And if we assume that Ais and Bell parents made part of those fights that could also explain how they grow so fast. Ais must be one of the youngest people to reach lvl 6 and in all honesty training and dedication aren't enough to justify her growth. We all know that she must have some kind of power from her past.

And if it's true that her parents were part of Zeus or Hera fam or any fam that were involved in the great quests it's just makes sense that Loki immediately got her.

That would fix the gap, which they improved but it's still bad given how anxious some players become just to try some new stuff. With that the distribution of rewards and freebies would be finally fair because we, NA server, wouldn't wine for months for things JP forgets the day after.

And with all this we can conclude that what PAD needs is to it's developer to start invest on the game again. A lot of gacha games have simultaneous releases for all their servers WITH ALL TRANSLATED from jp to eng. So why the same doesn't happen on PAD? 

Because gungho managed to grab not only whales from JP but also from all over the globe to spend on a single server. If that happens why would they invest in people and resources to create a better experience? Why would they care if they know that it's just takes one single new op monster with it's title in Japanese to cash from all over the place?? 

Gungho are actually smart!! They even have people working for free for them to translate things because they know how desperate people will be to get that new japanese exclusive for just 2 months.

PuzzleAndDragons,fnih9ya,t1_fnifud4,1586979973.0,"Sorry, it's exactly her! That's why I didn't see her in your box?

To me her base form it's great for that team and in all honesty I use her way more now because I didn't have a good team for her evo."
PuzzleAndDragons,fnht8zj,t3_g1pnj2,1586968449.0,"Right now I think you don't have what it takes to make a good team for her. Sure you have Yshtola or Gamayla that are great but I think you are missing some ""key"" subs like Minaka, Chun Li and and Elsha from the same machine as Deena.

These I mentioned last give a lot of S and haste so Deena and/or Fasca can transform on the first turn while also providing water skyfall for 99 turns, rcv and board changers as well.

If somehow you can make a team that you can transform on the first turn than you should pair with Fasca so you can have at least 6 water orbs to activate Deena each turn.

Sorry if I didn't explain that well or if I missed something from your box."
DanmachiMemoriaFreese,fnejuz9,t1_fnefsg6,1586890665.0,"Sorry to say this but yes that was your question. That's how you get dulb.

PuzzleAndDragons,fn9vqyq,t1_fn9tvfc,1586785693.0,"Chill man. It's obviously a greedy move, to me at least, because all of these gfe are used as trade fodder on collabs in which their supposedly main income should come from.

They are very aware that every time a new collab arrives the community advises on trading and not rolling and in most collabs people trade away their Odins and Kalis.

Why is it greedy for me? Because in all honesty I don't think whales are going to spend more or less just because of moves like this one.

It's always good that they maintain older cards usefulness but making them permanent stamps is not a smart move specially with gfe."
PuzzleAndDragons,fn9s8p9,t1_fn9ruhl,1586783253.0,"These Revo will eventually not be used by anyone as the time goes by as no one uses them now.

With this move they are just being greedy."
DanmachiMemoriaFreese,fn694pu,t3_fztpt7,1586692172.0,You spent hero light on that Bell? From now on you definitely should ask first.
PuzzleAndDragons,fn1b961,t1_fn1866p,1586558468.0,Actually I'm only on android and it just doesn't save. Read somewhere that it was the mods that had to unlock it.

PuzzleAndDragons,fmyap9b,t1_fmy9ffj,1586481814.0,"Yeah, to be honest that dungeon awakening would fit like a glove on my XSaline team.

I would buy that in a blink of an eye. Unfortunately it seems Ilmina doesn't like me."
PuzzleAndDragons,fmy96sp,t3_fy4swd,1586480843.0,"From what I saw on pad.protic your only chance of getting that Revo Ilmina is from doing pulls or trade for her.

 There is no info for a Ilmina guaranteed bundle unfortunately."
PuzzleAndDragons,fmwuwvj,t3_fxvr4w,1586453469.0,"Reroll for Asuna and evolve her. She's a great fujin active and full blind res that you shouldn't waste.

That same form as a lead is also good so you can form a team and clear the most content you can while hoarding stones for a good supergod fest.

Honestly I don't think that right now the Relic dragons machine will do much for you."
PuzzleAndDragons,fmuhxid,t1_fmug8a2,1586391750.0,"If you can at least cover blind and poison res that should be enough for most dungeons. True that jammers are annoying but not like the other two. Having access to tape and cloud it will help you a lot too.

Don't forget that if you are mainly focusing on light you can also check on other cards you have with that sub attribute. There you have more options for awakenings and actives as well.

Edit: Example, if you happen to have Allura from dbdc than you have a option to counter orb match restriction."
PuzzleAndDragons,fmubyy7,t3_fxgvzw,1586388414.0,"Aside those you have Hathor, Fagan and XIlmina. Actually your Kio is great because he removes time debuffs and creates orbs and you can assist on him another good active thanks to it's low cool down active. 

XIlmina gives a good board and still has good awakenings like vdp and team hp up.

Regardless all that right now your main concern with that team are hazards resistances so you should also focus on that."
PuzzleAndDragons,fmtxgc6,t3_fxezs7,1586380734.0,"Do you simply want her? Than yes!

XD"
PuzzleAndDragons,fmtutcx,t3_fxdjam,1586379387.0,"Think of her as a good light orb maker while locking them. I used her a few times and now she got a nice buff of two vdp awakenings making her more reliable on farm team for example.

She even is a nice budget  time stick if needed.

DanmachiMemoriaFreese,fmtowc8,t1_fmtjqqd,1586376461.0,"Yeah, right now I'm at 9.7k and no way I'm giving up now XD

It will be in June if I'm not mistaken and until then I don't know how many iris they are going to give.

I also think that my team is good now but as you said if that Bell or the latest Ais appear I really start to think it is a loss for me."
