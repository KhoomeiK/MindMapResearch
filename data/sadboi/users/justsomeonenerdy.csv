BipolarReddit,fk45oy1,t3_fg103p,1583853837.0,"Feel this so much. Anytime I’m overly emotional, sensitive, sad. I am always on edge trying to figure out if this is a down, and then proceed to freak out bc “I can’t have this happen right now with work.”

Then when I do get my period (if I get it) it’s a surge of relief. But the roller coaster can get tiring."

I’m glad the Xanax has helped you though, I was put on Hydroxyzine instead (it’s actually for allergies, etc) but it’s been great for the anxiety when I’ve needed it. Being on lamictal has made it to where I don’t find myself needing it though."
bipolar,fijrop2,t3_f7syrr,1582461550.0,"As someone who was also prescribed different medications for depression (until much later a different doctor was like, no this is bipolar not depression) - I am proud of you for continuing on and getting back on your medication. My doctor has told me how bad antidepressants can affect someone with bipolar, and it’s so true. When I was on Prozac I was crying constantly, having panic attacks (which up until that point I’d never had issues with), wreck-less behavior, suicidal thoughts, walking out of a 4 year job, etc.

I was off meds for about 5 years. Switching on so many antidepressants and xanax and all that left me not wanting to keep trying. 

While a healthy diet and exercise was helping, and that whole (I can totally control my mania, etc) I finally realized after my last 3 month downer that I wasn’t able to “control” it on my own and needed to seek help. 

I am currently on Lamictal (going on well over 5+ weeks) and I feel so different. Awake, more in tune. It’s been such a game changer. I can focus at work. I can function. It’s wonderful. Keep up the great work! You’ve got this!"

bipolar,fij6p2t,t3_f7xd8u,1582436150.0,"Yep. Been feeling so good after coming out of such a bad place the last few months. Finally got on a mood stabilizer for BP 1. I have been feeling great and more in  control of myself, and I feel like the medication is really working! But... there’s also that weary caution and slight fear. Plus I’ve been staying up later lately and I’m like “it’s totally fine , too much caffeine” so I’m going to work on weaning myself off now. Bc I have been sleeping better since getting on lamictal 100mg"

Bipolar may be a lifetime thing we have to deal with but those lows (as terrible as they can be) are not forever. There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel. The cycle you’re going though will end, and you’ll feel okay again."

lamictal,ff94mrb,t3_eruhnc,1579704730.0,"I just started taking Lamictal 25 mg (Jan 15th) I move up to the 50mg next Wednesday (Jan 29). I have Bipolar 1 and I’m 29. 

I definitely have felt changes since being on it. I’m not sure if it’s mental or not, but the first 3-4 days I experienced a lot of ups, perky, chatty. The 5-6 day I felt a bit of a downer, and trouble doing stuff. Like working out, focusing on a project at work, cleaning, etc. Just overall lazy days but thankfully they happened during the weekend. 

Day 7-8 (Today being day 8) I have felt a bit out of it mentally. I also have to frequently go tinkle more. I can tell I am a bit more distracted as well these last 2 days compared to my usual productivity at work. (If you’ve ever smoked pot, the best comparison is feeling like you’re stoned. But you’re not. But that out of it, not necessarily as sharp, or able to think as quickly is there. It just feels like I’m spacey)

Like I said, I’m not sure if it’s a mental thing, but I have felt differences since taking it. I know it’s also not just me as my wife noticed my uppity moods and the swings over the weekend.

Good luck on your journey, def open to sharing any side effects with you I’ve noticed or anything like that. I’ve been journaling since starting the meds so I can go back and see how the transition is going. That may be a good idea for you so you can gauge how you’re feeling."
bipolar_irl,ff248t3,t1_fet3tf4,1579493375.0,"Yeah I can relate to that for sure, I guess that’s part of the self care. Continuing your medication and dealing with the side effects in order to be a healthier version of yourself. Putting you and your mental health first. That’s not an easy decision, huge respect! You should be proud of yourself!

Yeah I most certainly plan to listen to mine, I want to do  what I can to keep taking steps in the right direction."

bipolar_irl,feqwwg4,t1_feox9tj,1579346974.0,"Yes, I can imagine that you do. In a way though I can see how that would be beneficial in aiding you to not use, as someone who struggles to quit smoking pot, I completely understand! It’s just so crazy how it takes up the receptors and just blocks the other substances - I think it just puts into perspective for me just how sensitive these meds can be (started lamotrigine)

I use marijuana on a pretty regular basis, and I asked my doctor about whether or not the med would clash with the marijuana. Doc said that he didn’t think there was an issue, but he had been told by one of his professors once that the THC would always win and take the receptors. So it’s made me not want to smoke in the mornings anymore when I’m taking the med. 

Struggling to stop doesn’t seem to be as hard anymore, and I’m not sure if it’s being on medication and being able to handle life more, or if it’s the subconscious mind making that decision because of what the doc said. 


I’m glad to hear it’s improved your health, that’s such a big win! Has not being able to get high caused you to feel irritated or feel any other negative side effects long term?"
bipolar_irl,feqtkx8,t1_feni91j,1579345875.0,"Wow, thank you for taking the time to explain that.  I’ve taken psychedelics, before being on medication, and reading through all the comments made me make a mental note that now that I’m on medication - it’s best not to mess around with anything else."
