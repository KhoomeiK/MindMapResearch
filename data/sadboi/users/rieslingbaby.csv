EDAnonymous,fpszrzo,t3_gf0yl1,1588882397.0,I’m leaving my therapist bc I’m graduating and and he wants to refer me to an ED specialist but I don’t know if I want the help. Seeing someone would require telling my parents bc I’m still on their insurance. They don’t know I’m in therapy rn bc I saw someone through my university. I’d probably be vague and not tell my parents about the ED (my therapist recommended this too lol) but still .. I don’t want them to know I need therapy and I don’t wanna have that conversation w them. I also just don’t want to see anyone for the eating disorder until I lose weight. I’ve gained weight in quarantine and I’m not even a little bit okay with it. But I’m so miserable w the disorder and my teeth hurt all the time and I have heart palpitations all the time and I’m not even losing weight. I feel so trapped in this disorder I don’t know what to do
EDAnonymous,fow8m6k,t3_g9ho6v,1588115034.0,"I told my therapist today about restricting, bingeing, and purging and he was nice about it but it was obvious he didn’t have much experience with eating disorders. There were a lot of long silences mostly bc I’m so bad at articulating when I’m nervous. I accidentally referred to it as a deeply engrained habit (I didn’t wanna use the term eating disorder without a diagnosis.....lol) and then he kept using the word habit too and it made me feel invalidated but I know he was just mirroring me. I’m leaving him in 2 weeks anyway bc I’m graduating. He asked if I want a referral to an ED specialist and honestly I don’t but I feel so fucking irreparably crazy all the time I just want this to be over. Also I’m  drunk rn. I feel so completely helpless"

TalkTherapy,fnp48g9,t3_g2uo3o,1587138931.0,"I completely get how hard it is, I put it off for like 8 years, but I finally made my first appointment in like January/February and it was such a good decision and I really hope u can do the same!! You only have to tell them as much as you’re comfortable with. I have social anxiety and was terrified and in the first two appointments barely told my therapist anything bc I would get too anxious to speak and would answer most of his questions with “I don’t know” or complete silence lol and I expected him to get annoyed at me for it but he never did and he was always so understanding and patient with me and it built our trust a lot. Even when I wasn’t telling him anything it was grounding/reassuring just to know I had someone to sit with every week that I could open up to more if I needed to. I tell him more now and every time I reveal something new he’s super accepting and acknowledges how hard it must have been for me to say, and he’s never tried to make me talk about anything I don’t want to (I keep expecting him to force me to change even though I’m not sure I’m ready bc he knows about my ED but he doesn’t even mention it unless I do). My advice would be just to bite the bullet and make an appointment and even if all u can do at first is just sit there and tell them the bare minimum, that’s perfectly fine and with time it’ll get easier to open up as u build trust"

BPD,fn2nzhp,t3_fyznbz,1586596278.0,She’s right.

EDAnonymous,fcod2x9,t3_ei8hxw,1577829282.0,"I’m honestly not entirely sure? I don’t think I’ve ever been normal about food. When I was very young I would barely eat and it made my parents so upset, and then when I was like 9 I would eat like 6 slices of bread in secret and feel shameful and out of control about it which, in retrospect, is reminiscent of the mentality of binges but idk I feel like it doesn’t count as bingeing. When I was 10 I was going to wear a skirt on a special occasion so I ran on our treadmill until I felt sick every day the week beforehand. When I was 12 I tried to purge for the first time but couldn’t.  
  
When I was 14 I started restricting, exercising, obsessively weighing myself. Skipping meals and lying to everyone around me about having eaten when I hadn’t. I had a private Pinterest board of thinspo. I used to write the word “fat” on my thighs w marker. I knew it wasn’t normal but I honestly still don’t know if this was “enough” to be an eating disorder bc I eventually kind of came out of it on my own and started eating again, and since it’s been so many years I can’t remember how severe/consistent the behaviors were.  
  
15-19 I ate kind of normally / overate and gained 20 pounds. I’d still sometimes skip meals and lie about it, and I usually wouldn’t eat during the day, but in the afternoon and at night I’d consume most of my calories. Like I wouldn’t eat during the school day and then at 4pm I’d bake cookies and consume 1000 calories worth and just continue eating other stuff throughout the night. I’m only now realizing how disordered that was but I didn’t feel like food occupied that much of my thoughts and I no longer weighed myself every day so I thought I was fine.  
  
At 19 (end of 2017; I’m 21 now) I finally purged after trying a few times throughout the years and I immediately got hooked and started doing it every day.  It literally came out of nowhere like I hadn’t even been trying to lose weight before this, I was just stressed and lonely. I’ve been in a restrict/binge/purge cycle ever since and food occupies absolutely all of my thoughts."
