UnusAnnus,fn82fva,t3_g02vjz,1586732491.0,"Not my story, but my mothers: So, my mom has always thought she had some kind of connection with what ever is on the other side after death, and this happens to be the scariest one.

So, some background info is that my great grandfather at the time, was hospitalized, and dying. He also always wore heavy boots.

When i was a couple of years old, my mother was not working and was staying home with me. My father worked with computers, and she was home alone most of the time. Some time go by and she decides to go take a shower, our mirrors was quite prone to getting fogged up, so she wipes the mirror when she gets out. What she sees next freaks her the frick out, she sees the reflection of my hospitalized and dying great grandfather in the mirror, staring at her. 

She gets real scared and calls my dad and begs him to get home. He gets home and comforts her. She tells him that they need to call the hospital right now because something is wrong. They called and got told that he was all fine. 

My mom remains sceptical. A couple of hours go by, and they suddenly hear steps on the wooden stairs outside their house. They go to investigate, only to find nothing. They shut the door, and locks it. They are now hearing steps inside the house. My great grandfather always wore heavy boots, and the steps exactly like that. 

Some more time go by, and they are now hearing the steps on their balcony. Same heavy boot steps. My mom gets an eerie feeling, and decides to call the hospital. The message now is that he is only moments away from dying. My parents rush to the hospital. When they arrive, my grandmother tells him that ''Look who's here'' (referring to my mother). My great grandfather then sees her, and takes his last breaths before passing away.

Sorry for my bad English, its not my native language."
