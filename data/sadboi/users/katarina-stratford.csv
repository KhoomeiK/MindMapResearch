Threw my belongings into the car whilst screeching and proceeded to hyperventilate and sob in the middle of the busy car park. The first ‘safe’ people I saw were a little old couple with the sweetest Dutch accents, who were understandably freaked out when approached by a sobbing incoherent stranger. They agreed to help me and the gentleman *crawled into the back of my car* chasing the spider with tissues from his pocket, while his wife tried to console me. When he caught it he thew the tissue bundle onto the ground and went to stomp it but his wife *started smacking his arm with their shopping list* and demanded he take it safely to a tree.
