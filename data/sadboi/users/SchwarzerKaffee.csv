After a year of studying day trading and listening to many experienced traders, the one thing that stands out is you really need to learn your own style. You can learn certain concepts or signals, but in the end it just seems like daytrading courses and signals are just guides, but you really just have to teach yourself.

With that said, I am sure that the course I took saved me more than its value in lost trades. It really drilled into my head that I need to paper trade and trade small at first. Having a chatroom to reinforce that every day for months was valuable.

I still don't have a trading system that works, but at least, after having done a course, I still have money to trade and the right mindset to develop my trading style.

The reason I'm saying this is to point out what might or might not be a scam. Will a trading course make you a good trader? No. But it should give you the ability to teach yourself."

However, even though he's not really a Republican, his strategy has been to fully adopt the Republican agenda, as in tax cuts for the wealthy, rolling back environmental protections and stacking the courts. These have been the core Republican agenda for 40 years. Had Trump not taken on this fiercely partisan agenda, I think he could've been a transformational President because he has an ability to push through big ideas. He didn't choose this road.

You can call this a 'soft coup', but that is just marketing. The Dems couldn't remove Trump because that is up to the Senate. Trump and his admin have been caught lying repeatedly. Do you also think Clinton's impeachment was a 'soft coup'? If not, what is the difference?

>Because anyone who looks at it objectively could conclude nothing less than the coordinated effort to unseat an elected president.

Yes. That is precisely what impeachment is, but it is not a coup. A coup would be if the goal was to impose Hillary or Schiff or some Democrat as President. This wasn't ever the case. If Trump were removed, then Pence would become President and no political power would have shifted. This process is outlined in the Constitution, and does not usurp power.

For instance, some antipsychs block the D2 dopamine receptors, but the brain just makes new receptor sites over time, which can lead to hypo/mania, then they just up your meds, which is creating a bigger problem. Given this, when you stop taking an antipsychotic, your brain now has many more dopamine receptors open which can lead to Antipsychotic-Induced Dopamine Supersensitivity Psychosis, which onsets rapidly. Psychiatrists attribute this to the illness, but it is well documented that these are signs of withdrawal.

Even though I've been to 10 hospitals, not one single doctor ever explained this to me. It took me a lot of research to figure this out. When I finally decided to stop antipsychotics, I went into psychosis and was hospitalized and tried to explain this to the doctors, but they didn't listen and just forced me to take another antipsychotic, so I had to go through a short withdrawal again when I got out.

After 7 years and 6 Antipsychotics, I finally figured out that the Antipsychotics were causing relapse of psychosis.

This isn't even a secret. There is research to show this as well as a simple explanation. When you take a drug that blocks D2 receptors, your brain makes new dopamine receptor sites that are unaffected by the meds. Then, when you stop the Antipsychotic, you can experience dopamine supersensitivity due to the number of receptors and that can cause rapid onset psychosis.

BipolarReddit,fp6134n,t3_gb5czg,1588344057.0,"That sounds like you might have gone past mania and into psychosis, but the interesting thing is that you were able to pull yourself out with logic, almost as if you counseled yourself out of it.

It's definitely something to monitor. I was put on large doses of Antipsychotics after my first psychosis and the following depression was so unbearable and lasted so long. Meds can help, but over the next 7 years, I still went manic and eventually psychotic as the meds effectiveness wore off.

I know this isn't a popular thing in this sub, but I've decided to wean myself off meds to see how it goes. I went through psychosis again as is a symptom of withdrawal from Antipsychotics and am now in the following depression, but it's nowhere near as bad as the ones when I was medicated.

The hardest part for me is dealing with my own cognition and version of reality. The experience of being manic or psychotic is so bizarre that few relate to it, but there is something more to it because most of us experience the same thing.

I've read a lot about it, and there are some schools of thought, mainly Jungian psychology, that say that this is a natural part of your brain development. It is your brain basically changing personalities.

Given that you were able to pull yourself through this one, maybe start with psychotherapy before jumping right into meds."
