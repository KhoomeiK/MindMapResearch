CasualConversation,exjzg65,t3_ct71mq,1566365996.0," When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids. And I got a really bad rash. From the pony. And all the kids got to ride the pony. And I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me, for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out, the pony was already in the truck and around the corner. So that was my worst birthday."
amiugly,ewu8xgg,t3_cpxito,1565769884.0,Not ugly. I think you have pretty eyes! You just look a bit unkept. Get a flattering haircut and keep your facial hair neater/trimmed.
amiugly,ewu8fx7,t3_cq42d9,1565769192.0,"Definitely not ugly. You have really nice features, and a good haircut, a shave, and eyebrow wax would show off your attractive qualities :)"

socialskills,eu2q19x,t3_ce8bdh,1563395580.0,Omg dude I totally relate. In my Mexican family it’s considered extremely rude to leave without individually shaking hands and kissing your family (especially older) on the cheek. This goes for saying hi as well. I get so much anxiety going to family parties so I just stay home. This backfired bc then they think I’m rude anyway for not showing up with the rest of my family haha
LifeProTips,etprifh,t3_ccq6eo,1563062844.0,Is this wise if you’re a pre med student? I’ve been strongly considering this but I’m afraid that there won’t be as many opportunities to gain clinical experience or for research. Has anybody been thru this path as a premed and what are your thoughts?
Anxiety,ethqgyf,t1_ethk15v,1562823962.0,Ugh ikr then all my makeup gets streaky and I get self-conscious abt that and OOF it’s not fun
Anxiety,ethj93d,t3_cbp75c,1562817117.0,Omg yes! I’m already nervous sweating and the added heat makes me nervous that I’ll sweat more so it’s a cycle of anxiety sweats

SelfHarmScars,eoymqp7,t3_bq6dwo,1558942902.0,"Fresh aloe Vera works wonders for scars. Just buy a leaf at the store, cut little bits at a time and just put a thick layer on overnight or whenever. I promise it’ll help"
onguardforthee,eoyblj3,t1_eov3gsl,1558937642.0,"The books too. I recently did a book review for school  on “The Atonement Child” by Francine Rivers and boy I can only describe that book as a steaming pile of horseshit with a hearty dose of ignorance. What made me the angriest was the fact that Rivers claimed it was unbiased and the readers could “take what they want from it”, when it’s so obviously pro-life propaganda."
LatinoPeopleTwitter,eo8gwjr,t1_eo75qrc,1558366228.0,"My mom likes to blend up about 2 tomatoes chopped in fourths, some canned tomato sauce for extra flavor, half a onion,  and un diente de ajo.(I think she adds some cilantro also)While blending, lightly fry the shells in the pot. Then add the blend to the pot as well as the blender’s amount of water. Add consommé and a little salt and boil until the shells are soft. Hope this helps! :)"
