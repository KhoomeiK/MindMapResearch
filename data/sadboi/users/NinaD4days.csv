When the money flow got smaller they pulled the plug on her early to make room for new shows. Daron wanted to do a 5th or 6th season but because it ended shes started on a new project and has stated that if the petition gets completed shel do a movie at least but wants time for herself first because working on a show takes a huge toll.

ptsd,fi0oxpp,t3_f5r4eg,1582041775.0,"Abuse in early life affects EVERYTHING later in life simple as that. My boyfriend basically has to drop everything and calm me down then comfort me cuz I have these episodes where I get angry over nothing, then I get intensely depressed and shut down. 

We have deduced that it happens when I encounter triggers (which we have not been able to identify yet). They put me back to when I was living with my mother who used her unstable emotions as a weapon against me. I have night terrors too.

 About the whole intimacy problem, trust me when I say it may not be what you think it is. Over time, you will grasp this and understand it. 

The reason you feel that way could be that your boyfriend is now the primary male in your life, which was your abusers role before him. Talk to yourself about it,in your head or out loud but it helps. 

Dont over think it, but remind yourself who your boyfriend is to you and that he cares and cherishes you. He wouldn't have stayed with you this long if he didn't. He doesn't have the obligation your abuser did. 

In childhood my father was neglectful and I couldn't get his attention unless he was yelling at me, so in school I felt like I was dying of loneliness without a guy at my hip. I genuinely had feelings for each of these boys but it was always fleeting because they'd abuse me. 

When I got into a relationship with my current boyfriend, I felt that it would be short because that's how all my relationships worked. But he treated me right and cherished me but I would over think things and often thought about breaking up for seemingly no reason. After i really sat down and thought it through it went away."

My SO and I had a lot of issues with chores after he moved in because my BPDMother would always come home in a bad mood and use chores to vent her feelings on me. 

This led to me having an aversion to cleaning my own home and have an incredibly high standard whenever I do at the same time. 

Most of the issues in my childhood home came from doing the dishes, so usually my boyfriend does them. I feel incredibly guilty whenever I make him do them, however, because I end up having panic attacks and starting silly arguments whenever he doesn't meet my expectations. We talk about it all the time and he understands why it happens and doesn't blame me, but I also know that we simply have different standards of cleanliness and it's not fair for me to get upset over a couple of forgotten dishes or a leftover crumb pile on the counter. 

I ended up decided that I would do all chores in the house except the kitchen (and garbage disposal as per his request) because in my perspective that evens out the scale. I am aware that it is a bit silly but I find that it removes the argument issue and that's good enough for me."
