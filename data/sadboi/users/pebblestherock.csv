mentalhealth,fpewz67,t3_gd2cn3,1588556760.0,"Hey there! Sorry to hear that anxiety is keeping you up, I definitely know how that feels like. What helps me is deep breathing, mindfulness, and self-soothing activities. 

For me, this looks like watching ASMR videos, using meditation and anxiety apps, and journalling. I find that praying helps, or if you're not religious, meditation can do the trick too. If I'm anxious about a specific situation and I can't do anything about it at the moment, I watch Netflix or read to distract myself -- mostly feel good or nostalgic content. I also have a weighted blanket I use every night that helps me feel more secure and less anxious when I sleep. 

If you need someone to talk to while you're feeling this way or have any more questions, just PM me! Hope you feel better :)"

I usually have a yellow lamp to have some ambient lighting when I do it, and sometimes I have lofi or other relaxing instrumental music on. I also recommend wrapping yourself up in a weighted blanket afterwards, really completes the feeling of womb-like safety and helps me relax and wind down when I've been feeling really anxious and depressed."

 I find that if I don't love myself, no amount of love from any amount of people can ever fill the void and fully satisfy me.

Also, because of all my insecurities, I constantly doubt the love coming from my support network and I keep thinking they're all secretly annoyed with me."

Anxiety,f5sdl40,t1_f5rtjhs,1572424451.0,"Opinions on weighted blankets vary from person to person, but for me at least, it helped. Doesn't make my anxiety go away but it lessens it when I'm underneath. Only thing is now I don't feel quite as safe as I once did if I'm under a regular, non-weighted blanket. Also, if you have problems with getting out of bed, the extra weight and comfiness might make it worse. Overall though, I'm really happy I bought it -- but it definitely wasn't the miracle anxiety-reducer I optimistically hoped it would be. But to each their own!"
