I carried so many years of carrying fear, and realizing that the beliefs do come down to you, but you realize how much influence it has upon you. I had no idea but when it comes and hits you, there is nothing like it. Practicing meditation and kundalini has helped me so much."
kundalini,fp16ywh,t3_gaj1jz,1588226164.0,"I completely get this. Without kundalini, especially with my own demons, I have healed immensely more than I ever have with therapy through kundalini. Whenever I have woke up with a blockage in my heart chakra, I know it‚Äôs something that has to get out. Now I know I can trust it, and work through it. I have been physically exhausted and mentally exhausted, but I feel as though I can finally be the best version of myself. I am glad you discovered this younger than me. But everything truly is divine timing, and this is perfect. Many lessons have led me to this beautiful moment in my life. Sat nam."

Change the perception of what you are feeling. Keep working on yourself, and eventually you will attract someone. Do not allow fear to prevent you from your destiny or love. It will find you because love is available to you. I am 33 and turning 34 in less than a month. All I can say is I am so grateful what Kundalini has done for me, and it's helped me face my fears more than anything. Change your story, it changes your beliefs. Heal."
