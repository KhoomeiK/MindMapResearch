amIuglyBrutallyHonest,f1dfql2,t3_d8u5n1,1569382623.0,"Sweetheart. I think you very much know you're not ugly. Going through your photos, the manner in which you pose, the types of photos you take, even the way that you angle your body towards the camera- you know for a fact you are not ugly. An ugly, insecure person wouldn't pose like that, nor would they take those kinds of photos. I think you know why you're on this thread in the first place. And if you genuinely, day to day, believe you're ugly (very much doubt about that), the millions of Indian men in your instagram Dms would probably signal you in another direction, and the 10 million messages flooding your Reddit inbox right now would probably give you the reassurance you wanted. 

Hon, get off this thread. You seem like someone who is a massive compliment fisher, but one who fishes by putting themselves down so that men can knight and swoop in and make sure you know you're SEXY AS FUCK and NOT UGLY AT ALL. It's really not a good look. Maybe try r/rateme where at least the submitters don't pretend to be ugly to get extra brownie points. GL"

Subliminal,f08g2f8,t1_f07nsyw,1568481103.0,"Please research which channels deliver results, and which channels are bad for you (lots and lots of very awful and crazy people putting bad shit in their subliminals). Good luck on your subliminal journey!!

Subliminal,f07n25f,t3_d44b5z,1568465543.0,"im also fairly new to subliminals, but i heard that one rule of audio sumbliminals is to not mix different subliminal with different purposes together. for example, if you listen to a basketball subliminal then listen to a completely different one like a singer subliminal, it will no way be as efficient. choose one topic to focus on and create a playlist on that. 

another rule i read is that different subliminal goals will cancel each other out. eg, if one subliminal video has ""i will grow up to 180 cm"" while another has ""I will grow to 175 cm"", those two videos watched together will lower the chances of the subliminal working. (i have no idea if this is true)

the most important thing is to always, always read the comments. assess the comment section, and keep an eye out for the comment/view ratio. if the views are like, idk, 10k, and there are maybe 50 comments and theyre all praising the subliminal, the uploader is probably deleting negative comments that are trying to warn others of the subliminal. 

try looking up videos on youtube that explain why subliminals arent working. it might be a mental block (theres block remover subliminals for you to listen to), or you arent listening to them enough (each uploader has personal ideas of how long you listen to them. it is best to take their advice, as they are the ones who know if the subliminal has looping/repeated messages)

anyways, i hope this helps! keep listening, and please update us on your journey!"

amIuglyBrutallyHonest,f04lwny,t3_d3mzo7,1568390402.0,"sweetheart... youre very pretty in your own way, but this is amIuglyBrutallyHonest and lets be just that- brutally honest. you have a bad haircut that shows off your very high forehead and makes your ears stick out in a wierd way, uneven skin, unflattering 2012 glasses that distort your eyes, thin/sparse/no eyebrows, absolutely no eyelashes at all, thinnish lips, you also wear shapeless hoodies in every photo youve shown, etc etc. 

luckily, those things are really superficial. i mean if youre unhappy with the way you look, get hair extensions/wig, contacts (or at least glasses that flatter your face shape a little more), go to a sephora counter and let them color match some foundation for you alongside an eyebrow pencil, mascara and natural colored lip liner. Youre not UGLY BEYOND REPAIR. in fact, you have a very symetrical face, a very cute nose, untextured skin, and a very adorable smile. i just think like.... if you think youre turning heads, youre delusional. 

anyways i see youre a bts fan! good luck with that"
relationship_advice,eztqbk8,t3_d267q6,1568136248.0,"If I were you right now OP, I'd think of several different things to do: 

1. You sit him down unexpectedly in a situation where he cannot run away, demand to see his phone. If he doesn't give it to you, ask him what he has to hide. He will call you names, call you crazy, attempt to gaslight you, tell you that you don't trust him. If he does this, he is 110% cheating on you. Take physical note of this conversation later to present to a lawyer. 

2. Pretend like you dont know any better, and do not confront him or even let slip that you suspect anything. Hire a private investigator to investigate your husband behind his back. Present your findings to a lawyer. Begin moving your money and assets into a separate account, and start making sleeping arrangements at other people's places just in case this turns sour. Look up reputable divorce lawyers in your area. 

3. Stalk his internet history. Does he log into his Google account on his phone? You can see search history, sign into his social media on a laptop that he's already signed into. Does he have Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc? Have you seen his phone with any dating app icons on the screen? He might have met a mistress through there, and has replaced her number with your daughters contact name.

4. Lull him into a false sense of security in order to get access to his phone, which seems to be the main hub for his alleged cheating. Act like nothing is wrong. Don't mention your exwifes and daughters phone ever again- act like it was so insignificant you forgot. Make sure he feels secure and trusted enough in the relationship to leave his belongings even slightly more out in the open. Hide the charging cables in the house, or plug them into very open areas where you can see the screen from certain areas, or where you can install hidden cameras to look at his phone. Tell him that the cables gather dust otherwise, or you keep getting them tangled, whatever. I would also hide those cables during day and nighttime, so that he would be forced to charge his phone when he is showering, which may be the only time you can gain access to his phone. Note that iPhones take a little while to boot up when they go dead. You might want to draw a bath for him, or something like that. 

I'm very sorry you have to go through this OP. You seem very sweet. I'm sorry if some of my ideas sound a little psychopathic, but I've seen so many good people, both men and women, get wrecked by uncaring, cheating spouses who can ruin lives because they have the upper hand. Never let the enemy have the upper hand in this situation, because people like that do not care about your wellbeing, and will stomp on your grave in order for a little bit more selfish pleasure. If you find he is cheating, stay strong. Initiate the split. Find the best lawyer possible. Prove you are the victim in the situation."

If I had to give any suggestions, if you're into makeup, I feel like any good pair of fake lashes give monolided eyes a wider, more awake look. Avoid very chunky eyeliner, since in certain eyes it sets the eyes into the head, and looks a little amateur. Instead, pair it with a dark shadow and blend it towards your crease (so you have a fuzzy looking eyeliner, idk if you get where I'm going with this) or stick with very thin liner. I suggest looking at Korean makeup, even if you don't like the look there's lots of good tips and tricks. I also suggest not parting your hair messily, and maybe putting some serum in there since in lacks shine. But otherwise don't worry about your looks since they're seriously not everything when looking for a partner. Why would you want someone who only cares about what you look like? You seem to have a great personality and just enjoy being single babe xoxo"
