offmychest,fmzj0ca,t1_fmz6mf1,1586521882.0,"> I often wonder, when this is over, if people will hold onto that awareness, or if nothing much will change and we'll just go right back to that sort of apathetic helplessness and obsession with superficial distractions to cope with life. It's kind of amazing how much people will put up with (and how little empathy we have for others) as long as they're personally fed, relatively healthy, and entertained.

That was so well-said. It’s just so disheartening. And it’s like, you hear things like that, and in my past I’ve been able to be somewhat dismissive, acknowledging the kernel of truth but knowing that by and large people are (as you said) good to one another. But I the extreme circumstance of this crisis really sharpens things. The problem is I know that people really are like that because my biggest struggle is that I am like that. I am so critical of myself for existing in the sweet relief of willful ignorance because I still have health insurance, I have never gone hungry, I have secure housing. So I indulge in the luxury of looking away, like so many others. And look where that has gotten us.

I know that’s just how humans are wired (I’m actually studying psychology) and it’s not like some personal character flaw, but damn the guilt is real. And I’m really starting to wonder how much of the helplessness is real..."

I have a (well managed) mental illness. Chronic suicidality is just part of my life. At times it has been dangerous but mostly it’s just distressing. Traumatizing whoever would find me is a big thought I’ve carried close in really dark times. I’ve thought a lot about how suicide doesn’t snuff out your suffering and pain, it only explodes it like shrapnel into the people around you, so many people you’d never even think of. I love my maintenance dudes. I’m glad I didn’t do that to them.

It’s how I still get to hang out with friends who moved away, and my brother who lives in another state. 

It takes some finagling that might be confusing but my brother set up Minecraft online for us all to play, and you can do so across different platforms (so on computer or Nintendo switch). If your younger relation plays Minecraft already maybe y’all can look into setting up a server? He might be able to help you figure it out technologically, I’m sure there are YouTube tutorials too.

Neither of our roles are easily filled in the store (especially his) but we have both been home for almost 2 weeks, with special compensation circumstances that were published by HQ before we could even ask.

I found at a certain point what seemed like hardships and embarrassment sort of...changed. Into something more not, manageable, but less of an obstacle. I guess it’s kind of like “buy in” except it’s not something you do, it just shifts. 

I spent plenty of time dragging my ass up out of my bed and putting one foot in front of the other to get to the van and just put my ass in that damn chair and told myself see, I am at least getting here. My primary at one of my IOPs told me she couldn’t believe I came back after my first day (I got mad at the psychiatrist) but I kept going. She was a bad therapist. 

That’s the other thing, the quality control of mental health treatment is nonexistent. One program might suck and the next will suddenly make sense, it just depends on so many factors.

Anyway, it’s not like life is easy now, but I value it. I’d say you should give treatment a go. You can totally do it, you just have to is all.

Edit: also, I know what you mean when you want to tell your therapist something and you freeze up and lie or deflect or don’t find the window. I suggest just show them what you wrote here.

dbtselfhelp,fdid626,t3_eladwu,1578440216.0,"So I am very much a believer in DBT. Substance use is not my main issue but the first time I was exposed to DBT it was in a dual diagnosis program. I was using pretty heavily leading up to that time and I ended up in the hospital, suicidal. It was almost 9 years and three IOPs ago. I have finally stopped using about a year ago, after my 1st actual DBT program. I just graduated my second. 

All I can say is turning the mind is real. You have the right attitude about rewiring. For these patterns that have been carved really deep in our brains by substance use, it takes a lot of time and persistence. For me, it HAS worked.

A big part of it is stepping back from the black and white. I stopped heavily using pretty quickly. Then I kept using, more casually. Eventually the sporadic casual relapses became further and further apart. Its about building mastery, one tiny notch of progress at a time. A particular challenge with drug use is the very black and white belief that one slip up oh hell why not just have a good time, but DBT looks at it differently. Its not that DBT *permisses* occasional use, but the essential nature of dialectics is forgiving of these lapses of sobriety. Relabel, rewire. With commitment it works.

Also, for me, certain elements of the 12 step treatment are super effective and I use them all the time. Its worth educating yourself about them even if you don’t believe in any god or work the steps. Take what works and leave the rest."

There is a very big difference between those with BPD who are working toward recovery and those who are not, who mock therapy and seek confirmation that their misery and maladaptive behaviors are justified. It is not always like this on r/bpd but it goes through cycles (how ironic lol)

KindVoice,f3f6vc7,t3_dgtxh7,1570890748.0,"Listen, your safety is number one priority. People are responding as they are probably because the abusive cycle can and will suck you in, especially at a younger age, and it would be so terrible to see your life go down that path, so “get out while you can” is the advice because domestic abuse is genuinely a life-threatening situation.

However, it really seems to me that 1) you are not in danger right now and 2) you are well aware of the dynamic and therefore less vulnerable to manipulation etc. and most importantly 3) have a life and relationships OUTSIDE your relationship with him, so you are not isolated with his influence only. If any of those points don’t seem true to you, you gotta go cause it can and will go bad.

Now, your only responsibility it to yourself and your own well-being. That being said, this is his first real relationship. This is NOT your obligation, but if he can get ahead of perpetuating his cycle of abuse, this is a chance for him to do so. You don’t have to remain in a relationship with him to accomplish this. You’re pretty young also, so it might be too much to say you can work with him through his issues. But if you want, educate yourself about trauma (because growing up in an abusive household is a traumatizing experience) specifically c-ptsd. It is difficult to sympathize with an abuser because their cruelty is so unforgivable. But your boyfriend hasn’t yet fully formed those habits. Read about and set rock solid boundaries and confront him about his behavior. This is easier and more effective when you have some background on this behavior, which is why I suggest reading up on c-ptsd and generational abuse. Maybe suggest to him that he read up on it. If you can communicate with him in a non-judgmental way he might be receptive.

IF HE IS NOT then dude, bail. If you think that this is intimidating and aren’t feeling it, dude BAIL. But even if you do, communicate with him what you can about why. I re-iterate, it is NOT YOUR OBLIGATION but he could possibly get treatment/confront his abuse/find relief and healing. It just terribly saddens me to see a victim of abuse immediately damned to a life of abandonment because of his learned behaviors. They may not have been internalized yet. Maybe he has a chance to get better."

askatherapist,f1ndkah,t1_f1msyzn,1569614770.0,"I think it’s really interesting how mental illnesses are treated cross-culturally. An above comment mentioned complex ptsd, it’s funny how it can exist in one diagnostic reference and not another."
askatherapist,f1nclv3,t1_f1n22y1,1569614129.0,"I find your response very interesting! Thank you for taking the time to chime in. Are you inclined to elaborate more on what you mean when you say an internal structure of self? Or if you have any recommended reading on the subject?

What you say in your third point makes a lot of sense. I feel like people always just throw the word “stigma” around without describing what the real-world consequences of this stigma can be, so thank you, that helps explain a lot to me. It sounds like you’re doing a lot to help give your patients the best treatment possible. And I feel that way so much about medication management, when you say they spend 45 minutes then slap a label on! I know things are they way they are for a reason but sometimes it feels like it could be done in a better way, that is, a way that is more beneficial to the patient since that’s supposed to be the whole point. I have seen some psychiatrists who are more or less drug dealers and that has gone a long way in impeding my treatment.

I’m gonna do some googling but do you suggest any resources to learn more about complex PTSD? 

Again thanks for your time!"
askatherapist,f1nbun8,t1_f1mpun1,1569613624.0,"Thanks for taking the time to respond! I don’t want to come off rudely but it feels like your number 2 response is kind of perpetuating the stigmatization by permissing it.  I feel inclined to put in that Hi, my name is Amelia, I (might) have BPD and I am deeply invested in my treatment. Couldn’t the same argument about resistance be made about medicine refusal in schizophrenia? Just because the symptoms of a particular disorder enhance resistance to they very treatments that address them means it’s ok to give up and say there’s no way to treat those symptoms? Please correct me if I am mistaken, I have only very basic information on these subjects."
askatherapist,f1napdt,t1_f1mexn2,1569612854.0,I find your response to have a lot more traction than mental health professionals echoing that mental health professionals have stigmatized the disorder. It’s hopeful that this is the most upvoted comment. Thanks for taking the time to respond!
askatherapist,f1nakz3,t1_f1mmy7n,1569612771.0,"I don’t think it would change anything. I’m 27 and I’ve cruised through my treatment having the very good luck of working with providers who have the same frame of mind as I do which is we will deal with treating Me, not treating Bipolar or Borderline. I think it’s equally bogus to diagnose a child/teenager with bipolar II as it would be with a personality disorder, as in my case specifically there were no manic episodes. 

As to being scary, I think it’s scary to be diagnosed with schizophrenia or OCD or panic disorder but we still tell people that is what they are experiencing. 

Ironically in my case, the bipolar diagnosis actually caused and is still causing far more hopelessness than anything else could. My father is bipolar and I spent my formative years watching him go in and out of treatment, always trying to be better, and always ending up back on the ward. Nothing could have convinced me more fundamentally that that is a diagnosis from which there is no recovery. It seems overly tidy but it truly underscores the fact that individual experiences are far more relevant than the labels under which their symptoms are best grouped."

TwoXChromosomes,f0vkhl9,t1_f0uc23v,1568984548.0,"I gotta say I really like in your comment that your thought was “oh crap this guy’s gonna engage me in conversation” not “oh shit about to be abducted and raped” I know it’s an unpopular opinion but I personally am deeply resentful every time I feel threatened when I am in fact in absolutely no danger. It’s a tricky coin because obviously the consequences are so great if you are wrong just once but I feel like our culture of alienation and suspicion has been far more damaging to me than any of the random people (men and women) I have encountered. I personally really like ~~talking to strangers~~ meeting the people around me.

Obviously in the context of midnight street dude turning 180 degrees to follow you is where suspicion is relevant lol, but I like the idea of the first thought being like realistically, factually, non-judgmentally what is the most likely thing to happen and then qualifying it as threatening in context."

TooAfraidToAsk,ezxok0t,t3_d2z8jt,1568245634.0,No. Psychiatrists treat people with serious substance abuse issues all the time. They may have a personal policy you’ll have to deal with but there is 0% chance that they will report you to the police. Source: been in lots of treatment sometimes with drug users
bipolar2,eyrdlc7,t3_cybwy0,1567365893.0,"Also on the lamictal Wellbutrin combo and have been for years, except when I thought it would be a good idea to stop taking it last summer. Crashed and burned ended up in IOP and went back on the meds with a huge takeaway of gratitude that they work so well for me. That experience when I went off them was hellish. I’m still struggling because behavioral symptoms etc but as far as meds go I feel like it helps me actually get to where I am capable of doing the behavioral work, most of the time. Lots of swinging lately but what can you do."

BPD,ey3k7xl,t3_cv7xbo,1566766463.0,"OMG YES. TOTALLY. Pretty much exactly what you said. With measurements as well as numbers in general - I figured out what it is is I have trouble quantifying things. Ive worked in retail for years and they’re constantly talking about sales and no lie I couldn’t intuitively differentiate 1,500 dollar day or a 6,000 day. I also have a lot of trouble saying numbers out loud. I can’t remember decimal points, which one is a thousand or million or billion.

And with days of the week too! We have this process where we have to approve our pay periods- basically confirmed this is what you worked on that day. I don’t even look I just approve. And when you miss punches (which I do often cause I’m generally forgetful or move too fast and miss things) you have to go back and correct it and just can’t tell what days I worked like I just don’t have it in my mind.

I never heard of this as a BPD symptom!! Can I get a link to some info about this??"

DecidingToBeBetter,ewggrpy,t3_co3sa4,1565381483.0,"I have a thing I do which is make my tea sit at the table open my journal maybe put a three point to do list maybe write a gratitude maybe scribble angry drawings. I am deliberate about doing  it one step at a time and being loose about it which helps me feel less on edge or resentful. 

I try to keep it up when I am really depressed but it often falls off.
When that happens it’s more about what I DON’T do. #1 don’t do is pick up the video game controller. Also just don’t down sit on the couch. Very concrete, specific verbs is how I try to get through my apathy and intention to self sabotage."
