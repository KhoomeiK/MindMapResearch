BipolarReddit,fpl1ily,t3_ge2pw7,1588704726.0,"You are not overly defective, you are vulnerable.  Knowing that you are vulnerable shows that you have strength.  It sounds like the situations you have come across in life have caused you too much stress and triggered your illness.  I imagine if someone sat down with you they could come up with at least fifty things that were fabulous about you.  Because of the dark clouds you cannot see them though.  But they are definitely there.  I know it is difficult but try and love yourself as if you were loving a child who was sad.  Would you tell them they were defective? No!  Because they aren't defective.  They just need some love to realise how wonderful they are.  I understand the crying - I was not asked back to a mindfulness group for crying silent tears which I did not know why.  They were not kind or compassionate towards me - so, to be quite brutal fuck them!  If you want to pm me, please feel free."

PhD,fm93fhn,t3_ftrc0n,1585860981.0,It is really tough trying to complete academic work at home.  Part of my undergrad course was computing and when I was coding I would have my two year old on my lap who introduced a multitude of errors into my code by touching the keyboard.  If you can't get anything done it is pointless beating yourself up about it.  I used to work after they were asleep.  When I had assignments I lived on Redbull and flapjacks.  I do not advocate that at all because your entire family's mental health will suffer.  Good luck.
