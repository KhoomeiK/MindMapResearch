> But... they don't. As I said. Most Metal songs are probably around 6 minutes, not 12.

Right, they're not all 12+ minutes long, but my hyperbole was used to emphasize why I'm more tired of Metal than Rap and why I'd choose to listen to Rap if given the choice.

> The notion that these sound even slightly the same is nonsense.

Now that I've listened to them both, they really don't sound like one another. I hadn't doubted that the genre of Metal can surpass expectations and can have a wide variety of sounds.

You're right, I am. I don't often seek out new Metal artists in my spare time. Sometimes I will, but it doesn't take a high priority for me. As I said in my first post, most of the people I hang out with will put on their Metal artist / album of choice, which is where I get the majority of my experience with Metal.

> Lyricism is not as important in Metal (speaking generally) as it is in  most other meta-genre styles. The vocal is broadly considered an  instrument.

I can really dig stuff like that, where your voice is just used as another instrument rather than as a means of trying to get across a message. Though, when listening to Metal with my friends, I'd often hear them tell me something like, ""Did you hear what he said? That was so cool"" and I'd tell them that I couldn't and I can't for the life of me understand anything the singer is saying, either due to the instruments overpowering the singer's voice, or the singer's voice is too low where I can hear he's saying something but I never know what it is exactly.

> Some Metal songs are 12+ minutes long, but this is not a common thing at all outside of, idk, Funeral Doom or some Prog Metal. 

A lot of music can benefit from a longer length of the song, but when listening to Metal with my friends there would be those handful of songs that would seem like they go on forever with the absolute insane endurance of the drummer banging away those double kick drums nonstop. Though as impressive as it is, it feels like a very dull jackhammer in my head and it gets tiring very quickly.

> So you honestly think that Freedom Call sounds like Cannibal Corpse?

To bring this full circle, I can't actually answer that question. I've heard of Cannibal Corpse, many, many times before, but I can't say I've ever heard of Freedom Call."

But even to that extent, someone who you don't have to call your best friend. The friendship happens in the most non-superficial way possible, with disregard to similar or opposing interests. There shouldn't have to be reasons about a person's overall character that makes you deliberately choose them over anyone else like ticking things off from a checklist.

The less you have to think about the stability of your friendship the greater the chances that person is an amazing friend."
AskReddit,f173q13,t3_d84l7e,1569234566.0,"After being transferred to my 5th high school, I underwent some kind of test to determine my ""studying level"" and I must have scored poorly on it or something so I ended up having to attend some special education classroom as a free study block. I never actually needed help understanding things, but for the most part I always took almost twice as long on tests as my peers.

Sometimes, after I'd be finishing up homework I'd be given the opportunity to just wander around the class and find someone else who needed help instead of sitting by myself until the next period came up. I met my best friend who was a year my junior and he immediately called me over and said, ""Hey, you want to see something really cool?"" and I told him, yeah I would.

Next thing he leans close to a student with Down's Syndrome and said, ""What time is it?"", the poor student started screaming, ""HAMMER TIME! HAMMER TIME! HAMMER TIME!"" nonstop because that was a favorite song of his I found out.

Cue my uncontrollable laughter and my soon to be best friend trying to control his. The Special Ed. teacher gave me a good talking to, but what mattered was that I and my best friend had met and was able to share countless more hilarious times with each other in the future and to this day."

AskReddit,f0uoqo3,t3_d6o6y6,1568946414.0,"It really goes from anywhere being convinced that nothing's wrong and that you have no mental health issues or that there's some kind of shame in admitting that you're mentally ill and it somehow makes you less of a person in society. It's more often I find that other men feel more shame than believing there's nothing wrong and they'll pull through it somehow.

The shame that I see in other men is always put to the most extreme. Getting help for their illness, to them is akin to admitting that they're now beneath being human and will never have any kind of priority in whatever they do in life. Examples include, them feeling like they'll never have a job again, or never being able to make friends or find a romantic partner, never being accepted into any post-secondary education, feelings of being ostracized from any group and the list goes on almost indefinitely.

When men feel this shame and also reach out for help with their mental health, it's as if they have to prepare for a long trip or something. Saving up a lot of money, making sure that everything is paid for or whatever, then after being put on medication they try their utmost best to ""get through"" the healing process as quickly as possible, even to the point where if they still feel like they're not getting better, they'll just lie to their doctor and just say they're better so that they no longer have to feel this imaginary burden of being labeled as ""mentally ill"".

I've never felt the shame nor have I felt like I needed to hide from myself that I'm not well. I hear countless times how other guys my age just ""hate"" having to be medicated or going to therapy or anything that's suggested from any doctor. In the end, what this turns into is they start self-medicating... either by smoking tobacco or weed and eventually turning to the harder drugs which is always depressing to see. I don't know where this stigma actually comes from but it's unfortunately common enough and I don't exactly know if there's any solution to this."

On the other side though, I've also known quite a few people that would care too much about what other people thought and usually focused on only the negative.

From what I've seen, I've never encountered someone that was so full of themselves apply some humility or modesty to their own character, whereas I've seen more often than not those who would only focus on the negative for many years in their life realize that they should finally begin to praise themselves a little more for their hardship and ignore what others thought of them.

AskReddit,f0qzfad,t3_d698ba,1568870034.0,"This may or may not get hate, but I did it because I wanted attention. To explain, I initially thought or convinced myself that I wanted to hurt myself because it made me feel better, but over time I noticed it only made me feel better in the moment and soon after I'd be just as if not more depressed than before. When I got a bit older, I tried to think about what exactly it is that's bothering me so much to the point of solidarity and self-harm, and after a while I began to break it down a bit.

I knew already that it was hard for me to form and keep relationships and that it was one of the biggest factors contributing toward my depression. I had few friends that were ever available, my immediate family was almost always absent from my life and I was jumping from doctor to doctor being tried on all these different drugs that were given the promise of ""helping"" but none of them ever seemed to do anything. I felt isolated no matter how hard I would try to make friends and the only friends I could make were those from segregated groups of other individuals also suffering from depression or other mental illnesses. I felt like being referred to these groups was, in a weird way, cheating. I never got to introduce myself or share my hobbies or even get the chance to prove that I may or may not be a good friend... it was all ""automatic"" in the sense that once you were a part of the group everyone was friends with each other for no reason other than we all were diagnosed with some mental illness.

I knew I was lonely and I knew that the ways I went about making friends never seemed to work and I knew I wanted to be happy with someone else rather than just observing other people being happy. I destroyed my body so that my doctors would know, try me on some other drug hoping that it would help lift my mood and eventually never delivering. Hurting myself was never bringing the attention of anyone else as much as I wanted it to and that eventually hurt me even more.

The fact my family and peers would give me the same amount of attention or worry regardless of whether I'm hurting myself or not gave me enough reason to stop. It sucks having those permanent scars, but in time it did heal over. For a really long while I stopped caring about being accepted from everyone else and decided I should just do everything I could to make only myself happy. I've traveled to the States several times and even to Trinidad. I've done a lot of things that while it may seem like a ""loner"" thing to do, the alternative I thought would just to sulk at home and not do anything instead.

I'm still on medication, but I have to come first before anyone else does now. I'm happier this way."

AskReddit,f0qcob3,t1_f0qa7n2,1568857652.0,"I went to this school called ""Burnaby Mountain"" which was two cities away from where I lived. At the time, there were some complications with my immediate family which had me moving homes a lot. I eventually settled down to live with my mother but by doing so, I arrived at just the wrong time where the enrollment process for schools had just finished.

You'd think there would've been some room for me, at least in the city I was living in, but every high school from where I lived until two cities away from me were either full or overcrowded or something. I heard some schools had 40 students to a classroom that usually had 30 or something crazy. But that's really the main reason why I went to a school so far away from me. I could've waited a year, but I really didn't want to miss out on the education I guess.

Not sure if it's the same from where you live, but in my area, GEDs have this really bad reputation like it's somehow lesser than a Diploma. When I went to college the registrar didn't even care if I had a GED or a Diploma, what mattered was that I passed high school and the grades I received.

Doctors never seem to know exactly why my ulcers keep showing up regardless of changing my diet drastically and exercising daily. I've even been prescribed stomach pump inhibitors to reduce the amount of acid my stomach produces, yet every now and then I get this incredible pain in my gut and I have to just bear with it and take more drugs to reduce the acid until it heals.

Migraines as well, because nobody seems to actually know what causes them but there are drugs to control them. Thing is, the drugs I take to control my migraines could actually be a contributor toward my ulcers. But there's also the problem that once I get a migraine it slowly gets worse over time to the point where I can't even work or sleep anymore because the pain keeps me awake.

I've always been told that stress is a common myth as to what causes ulcers and migraines but I've also been told that stress is a very common cause toward those two things as well. I'd believe it because I've been going through a lot of things with my immediate family and friends and generally the people I know in my life. I used to believe I loved these very same people but over the past 4 years, I've come to unfortunately learn these dumb ""secrets"" that my family kept from me and also coming to learn that the friends I used to love aren't really friends at all.

To have people I used to consider those I could rely on and call my support to be reduced down to just one single person was harrowing for me to say the least. And I guess the ulcers and my migraines are now a result of all that."

However, this is not to say that when you win or achieve something you shouldn't start giving all credit to everyone but yourself because in a way, that is also being a bit narcissistic when you think about it. Doing so attracts the pity of others who will then put themselves down to praise only you.

Why it's so difficult to acknowledge *everyone's* efforts is beyond me. Praise yourself and also give thanks to others who helped you get there, it's really that simple."
