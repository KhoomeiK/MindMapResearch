SuicideWatch,ez72jsq,t1_eyh2zrp,1567718087.0,I am so glad your mom put that chocolate in there. I truly believe moms feel certain things when it comes to their kids. As a mother of 5...I know I do sometimes. I'm 47 and have battled depression and alot of what everyone mentions throughout these posts. I'm still here. No one here is alone. It sometimes feels like it..but there are many of us out here. I hope you continue to thrive. :)
