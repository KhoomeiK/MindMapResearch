neurodiversity,fp3vsml,t3_gb4k2q,1588286734.0,"Op, I’ve seen a handful of your posts recently on several different subreddits im in and I really sympathize with your pain and worries, but it seems that reddit is only making things worse for you. I recommend getting off of it, and any other social media’s too, and focusing on self care and reflection. Pick up some hobbies to help you record your thoughts and feelings and express yourself- journaling, painting, or really anything that allows you to process all of these things you’re feeling could be really beneficial. I also like to take care of plants/my animals/walk around in nature if you can. 

Also, I really don’t think you should have posted this video unless you got his consent. If you didn’t, you should take it down. It shows his face and what is supposed to be a private conversation, so this is a real invasion of privacy and trust. Think about how you would feel if someone recorded you in the same way and posted it without your permission. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, but sometimes you do just need to take a break and distract yourself from your worries. In addition to hobbies, television and video games can help if you watch/play them in moderation. I hope you find answers and comfort. I’m sending some positive vibes over"

I’m an INFP Libra sun, Pisces moon, Gemini rising with strong Scorpio influences (Gemini’s ruler, Mercury, is in Scorpio and I also big relate to my Scorpio Venus). I feel like this kind of fits: strong empathy from my water influences, with Pisces making me a dreamer and wanting to make the world better, Scorpio making me more introspective. 

My boyfriend is an ENFP Gemini sun, Sagittarius moon, Gemini rising. Mercury is in Gemini. I feel like his makes sense because he’s very communicative and charming, while also being very playful and open minded/kind. He has a very logical empathy. 

I feel like air signs are more likely to have P over J because they tend to be very adaptable. Strong water placements (and possibly some strong air placements) could give N over S because I feel like they tend to be very go-with-the-flow/react more to gut feelings 

I vs E could likely be related to mercury because mercury also explains how you process information/understand the world. Also moon because it has a strong influence on your personality. 

F vs T would likely also depend on mercury or moon for the same reasons, but maybe more so on the moon because it relates to how you process and react to emotions/stimulus. 

Correct me if I’m wrong about anything! Hope you found some of this interesting"

BPD,fkyybq6,t1_fkye8y9,1584658740.0,"I’m still working out my diagnoses and I’ve heard a lot from my psychs and therapists that a bipolar-CPTSD combo can look almost exactly like BPD. The best way to know is to rule out bipolar or not, and if that is a factor then wait for meds to stabilize any mood-related symptoms. It’s also why self diagnosing is so difficult to get right- so many factors play into it and it makes it hard even for trained professionals. Would def recommend OP waits it out but brings up concerns to their psych.

And on a second note, if bipolar is a possibility, mood tracking is very helpful in bringing up patterns and cycles. I use e-moods and Daylio to track depression and hypomania, and I also use Moodpath for general emotional wellness tracking."

I was having really intense mood swings at the time, rapid cycling and even a couple of mixed bipolar episodes, so the sun and moon are kind of a representation of that. I also used really soft/pastel colors and a kind of fuzzy/gritty feel to the painting so kind of portray dissociation and a disconnect from myself and my struggles with identity issues. I also wanted to keep the color palette kind of light to give it a whimsical/joyful feel while still having dark themes so I hope that also shows/works.

It’s really interesting to look at and feels very - opposite of static but I really can’t remember the word - but it feels like there’s action and life which catches attention and makes me intrigued! It also feels a little Lovecraftian because it’s quite abstract and spooky in a really dark, grotesque way. 

If I had one piece of advice to you, I’d work on shading. A lot of the pieces are dark colors, which can work with a bit more shading, but atm the shapes and colors kind of blend together and are hard to make out. It’s great as is, but more shading and variability would really make it stand out! Experimenting with complimentary colors would also be something interesting to try out. 

Hope I could be helpful! Keep drawing! It’s great therapy and you’ll get better with practice and experimentation. Your designs would make for really cool, abstract monsters in a video game! They’re quite alien."

This is a metric I usually use for when I should skip a forgotten dose or take it as soon as I remember. You shouldn’t really get any negative or concerning side effects for skipping a day if you do have to skip. 

I also take my meds on an alarm so I don’t forget."

mentalhealth,f9jbdqk,t3_e5eg9t,1575365399.0,"It’s possible that you can have both! I have both. Rapid cycling has been categorized as ultradian cycling (cycling by the hour/day) by researchers, but this term and classification isn’t really widely accepted in the psychiatric community. (Yet) 

I can usually tell whether it’s my bipolar mood symptoms or something caused by BPD. Bipolar affects your general mood state. While stuff can trigger you to go into a mood state, nothing has to really directly “cause” bipolar moods except for chemical imbalances. BPD moods tend to be more reactionary. Something great happened in one of my significant relationships and I’m feeling loved and happy so ofc Im feeling really great! On the contrary, I could be feeling ignored and neglected and that could set me in the opposite direction. Bipolar causes moods, BPD can cause an instability in moods. (I hope this makes some sense!) 

It might help to read up on it, especially on borderline personality disorder. I feel like once you really get a feel for what it’s like, you either identify completely with it or you may be on the fence. Also check out different types of borderlines (loud vs quiet) because I didn’t identify with borderline until I learned it could present internally rather than externally. Another important thing about BPD is that symptoms tend to present pretty consistently (you’re usually impulsive even when depressed, you usually can change moods quickly) BPD is also characterized by a severe fear of abandonment and betrayal.

Another thing I’ve noticed with BPD is severe identity disturbances. People are either constantly questioning who they present themselves to be as a person, or feel completely lost regarding who they are. I often feel like I’m not my own person and I don’t act individually; I make all my choices based on everyone around me and I typically become a completely different person with morals and values and humor and everything around different people. 

People with BPD also tend to have a very black and white view on the world, but I find my bipolar affects this as well. When everything is good, the world is perfect and nothing can do any wrong. Yet, when I’m down, the entire world seems as if it’s purposely acting against me, even with minor inconveniences 

Not sure if this really makes any sense, but definitely read up on it, watch some videos maybe! It’ll also be good to verify with your psychiatrist! 

You may not identify with every BPD symptom; the DSM 5 states you only need 5 to be diagnosed but psychs tend to play it safe and diagnosis people who really REALLY meet a lot of the criteria. Also BPD is very very stigmatized sadly :^ ((

TLDR you can have both BPD and bipolar, but also look into ultradian cycling. Bipolar affects mood, borderline affects personality. Best of luck!
