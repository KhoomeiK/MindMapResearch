AMA,fdc8nr4,t1_fdc81nh,1578269265.0,yes you actually hit the nail on the head with your first guess. I never got the attention and affection I needed from neither of my parents which made me act up in school early on but later when I realized that this would only be counterproductive I started getting witty so I experimented with manipulation and lying to gain the attention I wanted.
AMA,fdc7j1p,t1_fdc6qq3,1578268630.0,when I was inexperienced yes and nobodys quote can be 100% but I'd say I'm fairly decent at it and when I really want to be serious about it I will probably succeed with a 95% chance
AMA,fdc5y6d,t1_fdc5lw7,1578267752.0,keeping up massive walls of lies around me to portray me in a better light or to have it easier has somewhat become irrelevant to me and its extremely energy consuming aswell as just downright morally wrong and unfair for anyone interacting with me. also I'm sick of being a hypocrite as I value honesty and loyalty greatly
AMA,fdc5s5x,t1_fdc5bqh,1578267660.0,I've never had the feeling that they caught onto my lies as lying about the stuff I usually lie about doesn't have a direct impact on the way people portray or perceive me and I'm smart enough to use some lies that could even hurt a relationship instead of gain an advantage. When I do however try to gain an advantage I plan the lies out with some details but I make sure to not be over explanatory as that would have the opposite psychological effect. I've done my fair amount of research on how to manipulate and lie correctly but the prize is always the same: for a permanent advantage I'll have a permanently reoccurring feeling of guilt which is energy consuming so I decided it'd be time that I quit.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp96br,t1_fcp8q43,1577854733.0,"that #ItsOkayToBeWhite and that nobody should get offended or triggered by it? how is anyone born into the 'white race' responsible for them being white or their ancestors being fuck ups? why is it normal for blacks nowadays to be racist towards whites (openly mind you) and that being glorified in some parts? I call bullshit on that and say that it's okay to be white as much as it's okay to be black or asian or literally anything. the hashtag was probably made my some white supremacist (idk just what I've heard) but that doesn't mean that non racist whites can't just take this slogan and instrumentalize it for our own positive non shaming matter like the nazis always do to our symbols. people jumping onto shit like this everytime are the only reasons slogans, symbols and words have the power they have and that they should've never had in the first place because at the end if you just see the slogan 'it's okay to be white' is there really something to disagree with? because I sure as hell don't disagree with black lives matter or black pride, fuck yeah go off I don't mind."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp430h,t1_fcp3tzi,1577849841.0,no I do not accept it as a nazi slogan that's literally what I'm saying? and I'm most definitely not the only one reappropriating it as a positive slogan as twitter is full of all types of people turning it into what it is: a factually correct statement spreading positivity. if you think whites aren't discriminated against because they're white or that they deserve to hear words of encouragement for who they are then I'm sorry but you're a lost cause. the hashtag was already turned around and a fuckton of people of color also reinforce the message. just look through Twitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp2a97,t1_fcp228f,1577848276.0,"disregarding my entire second point in which I acknowledge where the slogan stems from and instead turning it into a positive message factually correct statement.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp1fh0,t1_fcp1a4e,1577847532.0,"sorry but the core of the slogan is factually correct just like black pride is equally correct. nazis take normal whites symbols left and right and we can do the same by bringing it to a normal level. it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black and being proud of your descent isn't shameful no matter where you come from. period."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcoxiyf,t1_fcowwio,1577844314.0,I don't I necessarily have to like a culture in order to be proud to be white tbh. I enjoy a lot of cultures and the diversity of them. Me being proud of being white shouldn't impose any threat on anyone because the other way around it doesn't impose a threat on me either. I'm sorry but I didn't stem from a widely racist household and I can differentiate when a hashtag means what it means and when people choose to implement way too much into it. I'm proud to be white and that shouldn't trigger or offend anyone on this planet and if it does then they're racists because god knows that if I'm triggered or offended by someone saying they're proud to be black or asian I would be called a racist the second my words left my mouth. I enjoy diversity but I can be proud of who I am without anybody on this planet telling me otherwise and so can the black and asian descents.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcowsbo,t1_fcowok5,1577843716.0,yeah just like being proud to be white shouldn't be such a big deal when normal whites don't mind blacks celebrating their descent aswell. I don't like german culture
