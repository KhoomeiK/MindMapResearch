Used to be you'd give your kid a spoon of peanut butter in the hospital parking lot and wait to see what happened. I'm not even condoning not giving proper emergency contact info for kids. The comment sounds like a parent dropped their kid off while having an allergic reaction when it could have very well been the first time that kid ever had... Lets just use the example of a soy product.... At snack time that morning. I'm just questioning the commentors information given because personally in my opinion anyone who would give a kid back to a parent who dropped them off while having an allergic reaction and then couldn't be reached cause they were ""at a show"" really should be investigated by childrens aid. You are basically telling my my comment is irrelevant but that's just because you can't think outside the box and look at the whole situation. There is 2 sides to every story and then there is the truth so stop focusing on the obvious and don't be afraid to ask a question... Or answer one without some undeserved condescending attitude."

Edit: This amazing milkshake was purchased from Hamburgr on St. Paul St. In St. Catharines Ontario!!! Only 13 dollars and it comes with a huge piece of cheesecake and sliced strawberries and whipped cream as well as icing sugar and graham cracker chunks around the rim of the mason jar. I was full before I got to the actual milkshake and forgot I also had a burger and salad coming. It was a fantastic brunch, my only issue was the menus had no pictures so I couldn't choose something from how good it looks... It took me a good 20 minutes just to ask the waitress for help.

relationship_advice,fdspeyf,t1_fdqh60e,1578706234.0,"I agree! The precedents set in workplace environments to not discuss wages because its ""Rude"" is just a ploy so people have more trouble calculating their own worth. 

When you get a new job usually you are in need of money so whatever offer if set on the table is the one you take because you would hate to see the next person score a decent job because you tossed out a rebuddle. At that point the boss is your best friend because he's giving you a great opportunity. However bosses have been known to take advantage of this attitude. You may have the job security you want because you are the only employee who will empty garbages or tend to the landscaping duties. After a while it gets old though, the boss will come to you everytime because he knows you will jump head first into any task with a smile on your face.

That being said, it does get stale when you feel you are being taken advantage of and being treated like a lackey by everyone. Know your worth and talk to your co workers about what you make. There is no law against it, its just something boomers said was rude because they weren't making as much as they wanted to."

As a self proclaimed Satanist, I refuse to pay Temple dues. I will not turn my church into another money grabbing form of Christianity. It makes me sick to even think they would see this as an option. Pazuzu on the other hand may have very well came up with the Cash to get his little wallet card and fuckin t shirt... Perhaps he also refused to pay to the Temple and because of that he went on searching for more and more of what felt right in his own heart. Its sad that he let some Islam creep its way into such a solid and loving beliefs system. I have always looked at the system of beliefs as acceptance and love but because ""The Christian Church of Satan"" as I like to call it because they act like the church does. Pass judgment on those who refuse to pay into their hierarchy. I am more powerful a being than their ""High Priest"" because I do not let the parameters of written doctrines dictate my behavior.

ptsd,fb5g34d,t3_ebfawo,1576526972.0,"Sometimes the hardest thing in life is taking a shower. Its such a small task that people find it easy to skip a day here and there, no big deal. Then 2 days in a row and you notice you still dont smell too bad why not skip another day. At this point you are thinking, I should really take a shower but the whole thing just sounds like an exhausting task. You get so depressed, so anxious, so caught up with life that you just keep finding an excuse to not get wet. Almost as if that water will melt you. The problem is, water doesnt make us melt and for most of us a shower is a great way to destress and relax for 20 minutes of uninterrupted me time. You need to force yourself though, even if it's just forcing yourself to get in. Dont worry about using soap this time, dont bother washing your hair..  Just turn the hot water up as high as you can bear it and stand there. Let it feel good, once your body gets used to the heat you will feel yourself relax a little and just keep standing there letting the water flow over your head. Just enjoy it because you arent sure of the next time you may feel this good. When you start feeling like you may be ready to get out, look at your soap/ shampoo for a minuite and ask yourself if you can handle another minuite. By that time you will likely feel relaxed enough that picking up your body wash doesn't seem like that big of a task anymore. If you cant, thats ok too. There is nothing wrong with rinsing off this time, you are now in a better place to try again tomorrow. 
I watched a speaker not to long ago who said ""Holding your friend while they die is easy."" Taking a shower after her death was the hardest thing he ever did though. His friend came in with a towel and said even if I have to throw you in there, you are taking a shower!! 
Some of us don't have many friends though, you have to be your own best friend and drag yourself to the shower and tell yourself no matter what, today is the day that you will complete one small task. Then pick another one (maybe brushing your teeth.) and when you finish that, you will have completed 2 small yet very important tasks. Personal hygiene is the first step to feeling good about yourself. You deserve to feel good about yourself."

BPD,fam9sxq,t3_e9velg,1576199021.0,"I hate who I became when I was diagnosed. All of a sudden I wasnt the person I thought I was. I used to see it as a positive quality like being a chameleon. I can blend in anywhere and be anything I want to be.. Then I lost control and my life became an experiment in self destructive choices. I cut myself because I like to watch the blood start to drip. I keep telling my mom I need help and she keeps telling me she became a success after a failed marriage and raising 2 kids alone so that means I can do it too. I try to explain to her that I am watching my mind leave my body a little bit more everyday. And stay away a little longer,  she thinks I am just trying to get a rise out of her, worry her for no reason... Everyone I talk to seems to think I can just turn it on and off but have no idea that I lost control of the switch a long time ago. I do and say things sometimes and then the next day I am confronted with decisions I made with no control over my actions. My more prominent personality is a non binary failed rock star who is just trying to put out one song that people can relate to but I waited too long and piddled away my gift of writing and singing. Everytime I start getting ahead and feel like things are working out, my introverted personality pops up and sabotages everything and then slinks back into the shadows. The two have become enemies, they hate what the other has become and resents the successes where the other tried and failed. Ive sought council of doctors and therapists who all just look at me like I'm crazy I fill out paperwork and then never hear from them again. I receive mail or phone calls for appointments to deal but one of the personalities does not want to go so he will attend to things quickly and efficiently so that when the reasonable one comes around there is no evidence left behind. People look at me like there is no way I am this psychotic so I must be faking it but for what? Since I was a child I just wanted to know things that parents didnt have an answer for. How do you make a friend, what do people talk about, how do you develop a relationship with a girl... How do you act in certain situations... All these questions I have tried to find an answer for yet no amount of studying human nature could prepare me. Everybody is different and has their own experiences that have shaped who they are as a human being. No matter how hard you try to understand your fellow human, you will be left confused. Those who seem good are good at hiding their negative qualities. Those who give off negative auras may not be all that bad if you give them a chance.

I mean I don't doubt it happened however I'm in shock that a fucking therapist would take your hard earned money and use it to instill in your sons head that he would be better off dead. That's fucking psychotic! You need to contact a lawyer immediately, this is along the lines of something on reddit I came across last month. I didnt actially read the article for fear of putting ideas in my own head but the title spoke of euthanizing people with mental illness at their own discretion. Ive suffered from intense BPD for the last 4 or 5 years. Ive always had it but I was good at coping in my early 20s and just went with it. After hitting a rock bottom like none Ive experienced before I went to a dr and was diagnosed.. That was it, Ive attempted to find DBT that will take me when I am in no place to afford therapy and unfortunately Canadas ""free healthcare"" is a load of garbage. Its free to see a dr and he will prescribe you a sugar pill and the pharmacy charges 80 bucks to fill it. They say kids under 25 get free prescription filling but this only counts fir certain drugs (the ones that are just placebo). Its disgusting what drs are getting away with these days. When I was diagnosed bpd the psychiatrist mentions dbt but quickly added that it isnt always successful so it would just be a waste of time for me. I sit on both sides of the fence here because of how much Ive suffered cause of bpd. Ive told my mom several times that I never asked to be born just as my son never asked for life either. The world we live in now days is shitty and full of hate, racism and bigotry. The world is turning the tables onto white males and oppressing them to the point where they are claiming to be non binary just so they don't get lumped in as a ""toxic male"". Everyone walking around with a reason to be happy is targeted online by the people who have nothing going for them and they try to bring the happy people down too. 
I can see why your son wants to kill himself, I don't think its right what your therapist is telling him but also I feel you may be being a little selfish. If your son were to commit suicide you would see this as a personal failure because you feel like it reflects your personal parenting. I just want to remind you that it's not your fault. The deck is stacked against all of us and as much as it may be hard to hear, there is a way to let him go without telling him suicide is a bad idea. This is probably a bad example but when my grandmother was dying of cancer, she had 6 daughters who circled around her and cared for her until she died. In their mind being there all 6 of them everyday was great for her but it put an idea in my Nannys head that the family couldn't survive without her. I saw my mom drive 40 minuites a day in stowstorms to spend time with her mother before she died but in that time they were all saying things like ""I don't know what were going to do with you gone.""
My grandfather died in 2009 and after the funeral my Nanny said that was it for her and now that Papa has passed she really cant wait for her turn. 10 years ago. Instead of my family looking at the blessing that Nanny gave us all 10 more beautiful years... They were holding onto this poor 85 year old womans life and guilting her into staying alive while cancer ate away at her brain. Mental illness is a cancer, an invisible one. However your son is living in pain. I will reiderate, Suicide may not be the best solution. It may also be though. Your son is in constant pain, his brain eating away at him every minuite of every single day. 
I think a different approach is a better idea. If you are willing to take all these steps like waking up every half hour for well being checks and putting everything under lock and key... Why not talk to your son to try and find that one little thing that will spark joy in his life. Many other cultures cherish death as a journey to something better. When I look out my window I see that pretty much anything would be better than what the world has become. I can relate to your son, I also made a decision to have a child before I knew there was something wrong with me and as much as I think he would be better off without me sometimes... I could never do that to my son. Its just a value that I can't let go of. If you know someone who can let go of life in hopes of something better though, who are you to stop them? I'm 30 years old, a single father with no support from my sons mother at all. She hasnt seen or attempted to contact since August... I can only work 5 hours a day 5 days a week. The struggle is real and I have respect for your son for feeling like he could make this decision. You just have to look at how good your life is right now and how happy you are regardless of your sons issues. Now look at how happy your sons life is and ask yourself why his life is so miserable. Maybe he needs a change of scenery. Maybe he needs to be committed to a hospital. It may be something as simple of moving a couple states over to somewhere more laid back where he can take the time he needs to process life in an environment that he feels more comfortable in.

Just to reiterate one more time. I don't agree with the therapist and I don't know the whole situation to make a fair call of my own opinion. However I think maybe forcing your son to live and prosper in a world he is clearly very heavily struggling in may be a little self centered on yours and your wifes part"

Honey, the sooner you realize there is nothing wrong with a time out the better. People seem to look at sex as linear when they should see it more as an adventure to explore someone elses body and see what makes them twitch. I had one girlfriend years ago who would get ravenously horny from touching her ribs under her arms. At first she thought she was just ticklish but I told her to let that feeling ride out and see what happens... A few seconds later we had to put a towel down. Same with bums, you can hit the right spots with a simple massage and if shes not wearing panties I could just watch her start to cream up and even if we started out as just a massage ...dont try anything Im tired and sore... 20 minutes later and she wants sex. 
Cumming doesnt mean sex is over, it just gives you an opportunity to focus on teasing back. Have fun with sex and instead of asking for a break take control and get on top of him, straddle his hard on and just gyrate your hips slowly, theres no penetration at this point but its gonna get you ready for round 2 faster and without actually having to say you need a break. Usually if Im getting a BJ I tell them to slow down but just like the guys jack hammer move... A girl going ham sandwich on a dick til she gags may be hot but I'm not going to last long watching that happen. Take your time, enjoy that dick and if you really want to you can always come back to it later, I like moving around and I dont have many hang ups so if you want to make out after blowing me I am cool with that... I dont like the thought of boundries in the bed room cause it just slows things down and sets up ackward situations."

And I said yes... Commiting myself to it. She even said she still wants to hang out and stuff but because of her depression Im scared to ask if she wants to hang out... Im going to ask on friday probably but am already prepared for an I dont feel like company answer... So yea it sounds like were together just not focusing on each other which because of my bpd has been almost therapeutic. Like I can put my mental state aside to worry about hers. My friends tell me I should be looking for someone else but Im thinking about sending her flowers and a little card just saying theres someone that thinks shes great instead... I dunno I feel like Im setting myself up for failure but Ive been alone for 2 years and although relationships have come through albeit short and never very exciting... With her I feel something, and I havent felt anything since my engagment got cancelled. So I'm just rolling with it blind but eyes wide open and hoping that she just wants some time alone to work on herself... God knows Ive been making great use of the time to work on myself and just thinking about her makes my days go faster than when I have noone to think about. 

I really hope things turn out well for you too and Im really happy to hear theres people out there rooting for me cause Im not getting any support on this choice from family or friends who think I'm just in self destruct mode... May also be a possibility, not gonna lie. This has been great for my mental state though cause I'm in a position where I almost feel like I'm the best person who could have ever just kinda forced his way into her life."
