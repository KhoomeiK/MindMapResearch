Yuck. Alcohol is such a terrible chemical. And it's been abused the longest. I was browsing through a biography on Stephen King and the whole chapter devoted to his alcoholism and what his wife had to put up with like finding bottles of mouthwash and everything else but mostly mouthwash in the end was his drink of choice. He was on some Edgar Allan Poe spiral. I met a lot of homeless natives and Toronto that drank mouthwash as opposed to anything else even if they'd have money. I spent a couple weeks  when I was 23 in a Hospital. Came to after 2 days after having a withdrawal seizure and was given Valium through an IV every few hours but they put me in a room next to a guy maybe 20 years older than me who was into the mouthwash and every now and then you would become lucid and asked me if I could go to the store since at this point I was allowed to go out for a smoke to get him a bottle of mouthwash which I didn't. They put me in that room on purpose show me my future if I didn't quit drinking as I two have native blood.
Sorry for the rant and I'm not one to judge seeing as I'm on a pretty high dose of benzos on a daily basis as prescribed by a physician who is now suspended.  but left me with a year-and-a-half of refills thank God."
