ptsd,fqwn93x,t3_gl8qxt,1589710767.0,"[Trigger warning] i got ptsd from seeing a dead body and another dead body impaled with her insides lying across the floor. You would think that people would be simpathetic and understand that i have PTSD but the majority of people don't. They think that I exaggerated what I saw even though it was in a police report.

 For your own sanity, you shouldn't try to get validation from people that don't understand what PTSD is. I think we often seek acceptance from others because we find it hard to accept it ourselves that we have it. What happened to you is not your fault. You need to accept that you have PTSD because of an exterior element that has detrimented your life. 

 Once you accept that you do have PTSD and this is 100% not your fault, i can promise you that treatment will get easier and so will life. You aren't weak because you got PTSD, you got PTSD the same way you would break a leg if you fell down the stairs. 

 I'm not an expert but I really do hope you understand that this happened to you. You did not LET it happen to you. Accepting you have PTSD through no fault of your own will help a lot with treatment."
millionairemakers,fqs3r4x,t3_gkjiqo,1589597846.0,Honestly after overcoming quite a lot in life this would certainly do wonders fot my family :(
millionairemakers,fl3igzs,t3_fm4msu,1584785516.0,To think that during the hardest of times people are able to come together is heartwarming!
ffxiv,fjp13ql,t1_fjonilq,1583539286.0,Will try that if it's not downloaded by the morning thanks!
ffxiv,fjoj2un,t3_fejqsp,1583528757.0,Thanks for the replies :/ guess I'll have to download over night... Its bizzare it's taking up to 10 times longer than steam :/
ptsd,fad8shz,t1_fab0hnm,1575959726.0,Just try to not be too hard on yourself. Setting a goal for the year such as getting the help that you need or creating a routine for yourself which would give you back some control will do wonders for your morale. It took me three years being stuck in a bedroom before I became semi functioning again xD you can never change what happened in the past but you can certainly change how you handle it and how you handle your future so try to look at things positively
ptsd,faatxz1,t3_e8bu8c,1575913495.0,Anniversaries suck (mine is coming up on the 22nd) but you need to think that this is you here just a full year later and you are still surviving! Be incredibly proud of that :)
ffxiv,esbf6n1,t3_c6vcer,1561789247.0,"I absolutely agree with you. It is an mmorpg and the trust system is a step towards taking away the feeling of community in the game.
I'm scared people will begin to require players to already know all tactics before doing a dungeon in the future and hence pressurising them into just playing solo.

The trust system in itself isn't too harmful but it does worry me the direction it's taking the game and it was similar small steps that wow took that over a few expansions caused a lot of issues."
ffxiv,esaqdeu,t3_c6hy8v,1561765829.0,I feel so nKed without it as a whm D:
ffxiv,esa4zri,t1_esa4713,1561751633.0,Lol no one can anger the all mighty raubahn or he shows his wrath through mystical powers.
ptsd,ereq87t,t3_c1p29o,1560790315.0,"I have had this issue quite a lot in the past. I survived a really bad accident where I saw a lot of dead people. A lot of my friends would say stuff like: Oh I don't think that would have shocked me that much since I watch horror movies a lot etc etc 

You just have to remember that they are lucky to have never experienced what you have. You've been hurt really bad and now you are physically injured by it (I really hate the term mental illness since it physically affects your brain). 

You have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of because you are a survivor and each day you are surviving a little bit more.  So be proud of that and get the help you need."
ffxiv,eoko84s,t1_eoknyf4,1558659202.0,"I'm pretty sure they announced them for their expansions though. I'm not trolling or making a hate post, I just find it a little weird XD Clearly no one else thinks the same :/"
ffxiv,eoknba7,t3_bsagkz,1558658646.0,"I mean there isn't anything new compared to what is expected from a new expansion. I mean PotD was released in Heavensward and Eureka in Stormblood. I'm not hating on what is being added for Shadowbringers, I love FF14. I'm just saying there isn't any new game system (not sure if right word for this) that is being added."
AskReddit,eoixvxt,t3_brzuwa,1558629541.0,"Mental health issues are physical injuries. Just the same as having the common cold or breaking an arm, a person does not choose to have PTSD or depression. It has nothing to do with a person being ""weak""."
