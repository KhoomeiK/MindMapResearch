AMA,fr6aybp,t1_fr67h55,1589923008.0,"Interesting one..Well about a year ago while i was away on vacation 3-4 days before my return to home a friend of mine told me that this guy that we knew basically beat up another friend of ours..I was really angry at that point so i texted the guy that hit my friend..He argued a lot until i went back and we met..Keep in mind this guy has like a year or two expirience in boxing..So we meet and you could feel it so much that adrenaline was all over him and me to..A fight would break out any moment..To be honest as much as i wanted to attack him first I did not..So he steps closer to me and i tell him to back off and he steps closer with this look in his eyes like telling me ""what are you gonna do huh?"" As he steps closer i push him and he comes back with a punch witch i ate in the face..So as i get hit i go back a little put my dukes up and get ready..He throws a lot of punches and i throw to..I landed some he landed some but i was way bigger so at some point he started to not punch or block the hits so i knew he was done..I throw a good right hand and he falls down and then our friends broke the fight..My experience was 4 months kickboxing and a couple of street fights like maybe 6"
