depression,ezyfqmj,t1_ewrzu41,1568267253.0,"That's incredibly relatable. I know someone who recently cut there wrists and is always seeking validation. I hate him for it. Doesn't he know I struggle every day with the same thing. Doesn't he know he can hide it. I can hide it pretty well, but sometimes it comes through, and it is painfully obvious. People ask what's wrong, since I'm normally such a ""social butterfly"". I tell them
 I'm either tired or hungover and leave for a few minutes to repair my mask. I wish I could just sink so low people would notice. But even if they did notice they wouldn't care, I wouldn't. I don't. It's the human condition and I hate everything about it."
