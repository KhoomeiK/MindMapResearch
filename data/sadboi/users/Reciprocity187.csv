Ozark,fqqm9v0,t1_fqpqi46,1589567998.0,"I don't see it as her killing a guy b/c they were called Redneck's, I see it like I do the Frank Jr incident of respect in that seedy underworld. Darlene 'got it', which is why Frank Sr will align with Darlene. It's also while the Chief of Police respects and does her bidding, aside from having leverage on him. 

Darlene has earned Wyatt's respect, Ruth's respect (one of the strongest players in this game), the KC mob's respect and she's ramping production back up. The worst thing she did, which is inexcusable, was Mason's wife's issue; that straight disgusts me. However, Jacob was leading Darlene and their family down the wrong road based on everything we've seen.

Marty through Ruth to the wolves, several times. He let her be water boarded, then she was beat up by Frank Jr and he didn't bother to retaliate in any strong manner worthy of respect. They've used and abused Sam as well. Marty and Wendy are merely pawns of the cartel at this point and are the perfect marks for the cartel, unless they change their course. Marty and Wendy, as they said in the file episode, are just ""telling themselves"" things to feel good about how bad they are doing. They are past the point of no-return, having burned every bridge they made when they arrived (Rachel, Ruth, allied with Snells, Sam, etc). 

Short of using Cartel fear and force tactics, how do they proceed now? 

Sam at least is in trouble. Ruth is gone. Their kids are as bad as it gets and what they subject them to is unconscionable. Buddy is dead and gone. Jacob is dead and gone. Darlene is out for blood and took Ruth to their team. The Byrde's are in deeper than they've ever wanted. Wilks is gone and nearly allied with Helen - what says he doesn't return in S4 and turn further against them? Also, their foundation is dead in the water since the incident with Ben. 

I think the lense of crazy in Ozark is very murky and we can no longer justify what Marty and Wendy are doing given the wake of their pain and destruction. It's worse seeing how they lie to themselves, their kids and keep pushing, and in the end, their loyalty is no better than the cartels. At least Darlene stands up for her people - she retaliated against Jacob for Ash, because Jacob was just about to kill Darlene. Remember the scene?

In my mind the only thing Darlene truly did wrong here, when we accept the 'code' of the Ozarks (similar to the code in the show the Wire), is what she did to Mason/Zeke. At that point, I hated her and she hadn't redeemed herself. However, that was S1 and she's come a long way in 2 more seasons. Still, she'll never live that down, but we're sadly mistaken if the Byrde's aren't as bad or worse at this point."
Ozark,fqpnulm,t3_gk1jxy,1589550575.0,"Just finished S3 and until I'd finished it, I was in the Byrde camp. No more. 

There comes a time when the ""juice ain't worth the squeeze,"" that the ends do not justify the means. At this point, and it's no spoiler, the Byrde's have ruined and/or killed more lives directly or indirectly than just about anyone we know thus far. 

I get that she killed Jacob, but Jacob was going to kill her, as evidence by the knife he took. Also, her open confession to Wyatt of what she did, shows she has remorse and is not as crazy as people think she is, she just better understands the world more than most. 

See how Darlene handled Frank JR & SR, then brokered a deal with the KC mob; is that something Marty could do? 

No. All the Byrde's know to do is launder money and use force to get their way to supposedly save their family - that ship sailed. They've saved their family. They have some clout or pushback. By S3, Marty can do what he needs to do at his timeline, is making inroads and connections, so Navaro isn't about to execute on site. However, they're also burning just about every bridge along the way. 

The Byrde's are a disease, an infestation, that just by their presence causes people to die, change, alter their behavior and ruin lives, if not be killed by them or for them. 

I don't know if we'll have 1 or 2 more seasons, but I could theorize things play out as follows:

The Byrde's have lost every ally they had. They have (2) casinos, no Ruth, their children are fractured and being used to launder money, and they're in deeper than ever. Their way out may eventually come by way of Darlene/KC Mob eventually offing Navarro down the line. I can see a world where the Byrde's lose everything, Navarro is dead or in jail, perhaps even the next Cartel up comes in to off Navarro and free Marty/Wendy from their sentence."
westworld,flxga1r,t1_flw2gzw,1585582315.0,"One thing that throws me off is the ""you belong to me"" line from Dolores to Charlotte. That would indicate Teddy or Clementine. 

On the flip side, though, the timidity of the character and ease of Femininity suggest it's moreso Celementie, maybe Angela, especially given her change as a 'predator', which she became more so in S2. Angela was totally 'ride or die' in S2, as well. 

Is Armistice an option or am I missing a point where her core is gone entirely?

I have to rule out Maeve entirely, because Dolores would NEVER say ""you belong to me."" The way Charlotte wanted to be cuddled was more a Clementine thing, but I'd see Clem, when coherent, being more warm toward Maeve, than Dolores. That's why I'm thinking it's Angela, MAYBE Clem, possibly Armistice? Definitely, not Teddy, because that romantic embrace would be much different in the room and throughout. Not to mention, Teddy offed himself so he couldn't go along with Dolores' plans; he certainly wouldn't be helping her now."
AlAnon,fk4eol3,t3_fg8al0,1583858972.0,"Dad here, (40), mom is now 36 (qualifier), son is now 5. Back at the 'height' of her alcoholism, I had no clue what I was looking at. When our son was born, it wasn't obvious at first in his first months of life. She tried breast-feeding for 2-3 months, was the rock of our family, and so she wasn't drinking at all. Then he's about 4+ months old, she goes to formula, we begin entertaining in our new home and the drinking comes back as it did prior to her pregnancy. 

When our son is about 6 months old, her father starts noticing her 'fading', getting tired, being off at night. We'd have a tumultuous relationship, perhaps even toxic at times and so I thought it was just 'us' adjusting to a new home, new baby, stress, hormones, mom working from home, etc. As time progresses, she's more belligerent, more off, more unavailable at night, volatile personality, emotional. 

When I reached out to her primary care doctor, she was prescribed lexapro and was told her behavior and possible alcohol misuse was related to post-partum depression and yet her behavior and moods only got worse and finally I began finding (and confirming) her drinking was growing out of control. Thinking I was doing everything I could and having no one tell me what to do, I made so many mistakes. So many. 

Friends would visit and find my wife 'off,' believing it to be drinking related. Some of those friends in fact called the State Child Services, though it resulted on a no-finding. I didn't get it. No one said, ""Go to Al-Anon"" until about year 3 of this (it's now year 5, with 3+ months of sobriety). I'd thought her doctor, a family member, the police, someone, anyone would 'diagnose this behavior/disease' and 'save me.' So many times I called her parents or mine, and they'd seen her behavior, seen her be 'off,' evidently show up drunk (in hindsight, that's what it was), but it never changed until \*I\* got help. 

I recall one time, when our son was around 18 months and I thought she was ok, or not the alcoholic she'd become, I played in a charity golf tournament and left early in the morning (around 6 am to play at 730am tee time). I left our son with my wife on a Friday and Dish Network was coming by to take the dish off our house so we could swap to Comcast. I get a call about 1/2 way through the tournament that 'no one is home or no one is responding.' My heart drops and I sprint off the course, because my wife KNEW someone was coming to be there for us and I was playing golf with my dad and business partner who knew my situation.

I FLY home and get home 10 minutes faster than GPS says, about 30 minutes away or less. In a panic I know immediately what was going on. I find our son bawling his eyes out in his crib and my wife passed out in the spare bedroom just next door. When I sprint the stairs, she wakes up off the floor, confused, dazed, and deflecting. She's trying to pretend like this moment wasn't happening and she wasn't to blame, but she was. Even then, I didn't get to al-anon, and I let her do her thing, for 2 more years. Things got WAY WORSE and I didn't put boundaries up or seek REAL HELP for me. I HAD to put boundaries.

Since 2018, when we went to a LADC together, confronting her disease and she then denied it, I sought my own path. While my wife has entered and left rehab a few times, I have stuck to Al-Anon, therapy, engaged (2) divorce attorneys, consulted with the local police department, spoken to our son's primary care doctor and even turned my wife into the state child services personally when she picked our son up at daycare likely intoxicated when she wasn't supposed to. That day was the nail in the coffin and since then I've operated as if this is her last shot. 

I regret letting it escalate as it did, because this whole situation persisted because I persisted (and resisted). I feel I couldn't even broach 'recovery' until I got off that 'crashing airplane,' never mind putting my air mask on first. I had to lock down and stabilize my situation, but having been through all I have, there's no options but 1) accepting her alcoholism and being extremely diligent and almost ruthless about boundaries 2) divorce. There's no middle ground in my state or situation. Some states can force a person like my wife into care against her own short-term wishes, but not mine. 

Even at her worst, she was driving drunk, binge-drinking a whole week, entering the ER and then exiting against medical advice and taking an Uber or neighbor home. We live in a nice neighborhood (upper middle class) and my wife is beautiful, so when you see this picture, it doesn't look possible, but it is. The countless times that emergency staff have been to our home since we've lived there has drawn TONS of attention. We've gotten support, but it isn't without the attention.

Now, 3 months sober (I hope), it's evident her drinking was just covering up for the person beneath it, so the recovery on my part is even MORE important. My wife can be incredibly judgmental, but only privately. She loves to dish about the neighbors, family, my work and employees, or anything. She can be very moody and blame me for things. She's incredibly sensitive to my mood or perceived mood. She stays constantly distracted by doing home chores and just doing 'things,' that when she has no down time it's a dig that she's working harder than me and going 'non-stop.' She constantly compares her life to everyone else, and our marriage to everyone else's, whether on tv or not. It's to the point, I have to bite my tongue and 'hope' that as she recovers, maybe some of that underlying woman returns, who was happy go lucky, positive, did everything for everyone and so much more. 

I have a friend suffering from heavy anxiety that I no longer talk to and have heard he's a heavy drinker now and my wife is much the same. She has general anxiety about everything, needs constant 'pumping up' and 'attaboys.' She wants constant praise and 'love/affection,' even though she can be an angel one minute and a devil the next. I feel the reason I've kept it together this long is more for our son and the fact I've put this much time/effort in I'm not giving up, but if the person who's here is who's to stay, it won't be a long happy marriage once our son is moved out. 

Looking back, I'm blessed bad events didn't unfold but I wish I had done more soon and not given into the bad that happened. I'm now 40 and I fear the scars and PTSD from the past 5 years have marred any sense of a marriage we could have. I pray for your situation. My wife did similar things and only continued doing it because I just never left. I regret everyday that I 'normalized' those things and stuck it out, because something very bad could have happened."
Watchmen,fipfh5i,t1_fd5zun0,1582605440.0,"Not sure if you've seen the show Dark, but assuming Dr M. could no longer die, being all powerful, expected to solve all of humanities ills and feeling as nihilistic or apathetic toward of existence may get quite exhausting. He probably yearned to return to his former ways as a human and I've yet to see his psyche written with an in-depth explanation of who he is.

He's Jon and was a man, but in the show/book, he was shown to not care about humanity and toward away from it. If the accident truly changed him, why did he linger at all in the show/book? If it didn't, why not behave like Thor and always intervene if/when possible? 

On one end of the spectrum, he's an all powerful deity, on the other he displayed elements of being a human - which is he? Or, was his elements as a human man just something created, like planets? He remarks that he's seen and created whole solar systems and species? 

Some part of Dr M. displays man's conflicted nature with God and the all powerful burden inherent in such a status. Having those powers takes away meaning, discovery, enjoyment, pleasure, pain and everything that makes existence worthwhile. Being split and not remembering, allows someone to create meaning from nothing. 

My bigger point is...if Dr. Manhattan was anything other than all powerful, apathetic deity, then he simply tired of his burden much like characters in Dark tired of the infinite time loop. He sought an end or at least to live and die, because he felt too much for too long and wouldn't ever die. At least succumbing to death was his way out and perhaps, given his ability to see the future, might be the future he foresaw."
Watchmen,fipeugj,t1_fb65ieu,1582604945.0,"While true, it shows Dr. M isn't as evolved as he would appear to be, since he cannot change man's basic nature to self-destruct. If he was all-knowing, then any intervention in man's future was then futile at that point. Having read the Comic, watched the movie and the show, Dr M. is incomplete. Dr. M worked for decades with the original crew, only to grow tired of man's self-destructive ways. 

Why did it take so long for a demi-God to reach such a conclusion? He was more like a Genie that picked and chose where to intervene, rather than having a solid and consistent code of operation. 

This would bring in elements of 'Dark' and other time travel novella, because of Dr. M can see the future, then he only intervened or acted in the way he saw the future unfolding and his part needing to be played. He is portrayed as an all-knowing, future-seeing deity, capable of total creation (see Mars, dimenions, Veidt) yet his intervention isn't meant to keep a perfect utopia, it appears more to bring about a certain future, because the future would be inevitable. To go so far, it's possible in theory that he created himself on a long enough time loop (if you believe elements of Dark or other time travel). 

I just don't see Dr M's involvement as being necessary and ubiquitous; that's the human element thinking ""if only I had those powers, think of all the catastrophes I could help avoid."" But people of Earth aren't in heaven, they're on earth. It's much like how Manhattan/Jon open's Spectre's mind on mars and she sees the true meaning of events. Manhattan has this power that humans lack, to see more of the meaning surrounding them. Veidt injects that same element of presence and awareness when he orchestrates the events from the source material with the alien. He's creating an artificial fear event to bring people together in a way they otherwise wouldn't. Manhattan has this same power or awareness, only now it's also made him apathetic to all of humanity's plight. 

Life is pointless how humans live it; and it's pointless for M to intervene, because it's like a cut on a broken leg, it fix the core issue. Humanity was broken and the more he intervene's, the more he's expected to intervene or exercise any power or influence. It's much like being infinitely wealthy; all of the joy of getting to such a place is lost, because it's the journey and struggle that matters, not the destination."
wow,fin2kio,t1_fhxgwn2,1582554202.0,"Been playing since 2007. I started out pretty hardcore when leveling alts was about as time-consuming, but thematically, we didn't have the class quests and other facets added to since Legion and BFA. I, like many, have built up quite an arsenal of 'alts' on both factions and would really like to max as many classes out on both sides, \*while\* being able to soak up all the goodness of BFA before Shadowlands.

However, it seems nigh impossible to accomplish that because of the extreme and growing gap between ALTS and being a functional level 120 character. I realize Shadowlands will compress this gap via leveling, however as someone who's been around 13 years, I prefer to jump into the new XPAC without any lingering homework to be done. If I can level an ALT, I want it done now, without paying $60. If I can farm pets, mounts or transmog, I'll do it now, not when XPAC drops. 

Over the past 13 years, the one thing that's bothered me has been the lack of consistency with this design elements. In some XPACS it seemed ALTS were easy and almost manadatory such as Warlords of Draenor where your bases lead to HUGE amounts of gold, mats, etc and became the thing. Legion made ALTS worthwhile through the class hubs and artifact weapons. However, now with BFA, Alts are useless because the HOA doesn't distinguish enough obvious fun in leveling it and the gap is so massive to my 450 hunter from my 385 DK (or 410). 

I do enjoy the play-throughs and wanted to do that as well, but sitting here like WOAH, too much is mind-numbing. They add systems and push the gaps out farther, which helps keep subs paying and playing, but there's no sense of ""ah, I finished that xpac, maybe I'll do another class, or faction, pvp, or blizzard game while I wait."" It's like they've sub-divided the entire game down into so many basic components, it isn't satisfying."
AlAnon,fgvnck0,t3_f00ne3,1581150914.0,"I, too, empathize with your situation. Father of 1 amazing son, wife who does not work anymore. A year ago, I was attending meetings at 10 or 1030 am for several months, but that, coupled with individual counseling, wreaked havoc on my work schedule (self-employed) and in spite of the good it did, the burn out of diverting my day for almost 3 hours (1.5 hour meeting, 30 minute travel time to meeting each way) was causing other things to bubble. 

I tried to angle toward the Recovery Show podcasts, readings, engagement in the forum and online work here with other's. I don't yet have a sponsor and can certainly see the difference in being in recovery myself and not. I highly recommend the Recovery Show podcast as an addition to the regular work or 'online' engagement. 

As a husband/father, of the 50 people in attendance between two meetings I regularly attended, I only ever met 1 other man in his 60's over a 6 month period. My choice was likely to go later at night (6/7 pm) but that made the predicament worse, as I have no one to watch my son on the regular. 

I love the in-person meetings; I'd just found the counter-balance of schedule conflict added extra stress/pressure in ways that didn't even out. Moreover, the most important aspect for me going forward would be having a meeting immediately available if/when my wife had been using/drunk or relapsed, as she did many times this past summer. I quickly jumped into the podcast and books to 'cope' with the moment and it greatly helped me. Also, being here helped me engagement with other husband/fathers going through the same things.

Good luck."
fantasyfootball,fgg68fj,t1_fgf5s6p,1580755128.0,"I don't see how it could be a RB, unless they get 30 carries and put up a Derrick Henry like game. Williams did awesome, but so did the Chiefs. The bomb to Tyreek Hill helped, too, and Edelman got it last year for his performance in otherwise anemic game. 

Mahomes did what Garrapolo couldn't, keep them in the game and bring them back. He made throws and rushes to pick up critical yardage or 1st downs. Mahomes is why I thought unless the 49ers went up big (20-30 points), the Chiefs would win. As long as the Chiefs hung around a close game and had their prime players healthy, they'd win. The same thing happened last year vs. the Patriots, only difference was the coin flip. 

Williams did amazing, but then do you give it to the o-line who made the holes open? The fear of Mahomes going deep that kept coverage up? Mahomes was 0tds, 2ints, before he turned on the jets and got them back in it, just like Brady winning vs ATL down 28-3. Mahomes dug the hole, and dug them out and the defense stepped up. 

As good as Jones was, though, this wasn't a Von Miller performance, where he was harassing a then-MVP-QB Cam Newton and wrecking that offense. Jones 'stepped up' as he said he would, but it wasn't an otherworldly game-breaking performance."
DarK,ffubd88,t3_ev609t,1580238410.0,"I appreciate your thorough write up. I viewed this quite differently, as every character had their 'flaws', from Claudia to Helge to Noah to Egon and on. In my opinion, that's what made this show beautiful. More so, though, we don't know why people behaved as they did in S1 and S2.

Was it motivations of time? Did the events we've seen and those we've yet to see influence how people acted?

For example, Egon Tiedemann was unkind and unduly harsh toward Ulrich in his youth, likely because he subconciously knew he'd ""take many lives, the more the better."" Elder Egon did not recognize Young Ulrich - so which came first or is it circuitous? Ulrich essentially created himself and his issues. He was deeply impacted by Magnus' disappearance, as was his mother, and it's his sense of wanting to do something, anything, as an adult, that sends him to the past to kill young Helge that precisely creates the events which lead to Magnus being taken and Ulrich pursuing Helge through time. We don't know Ulrich BEFORE Magnus was taken. This is how the story unfolds: ""the end is the beginning, the beginning is the end."" It's almost like the Chicken hatching itself from the Egg. 

With Marth dying ""in this world."" Her death was necessary to 1) move Jonas from harm's way, or he would have stay through the Apocalypse 2) to move all pieces back into place. Was Adam shooting younger Martha precisely what would trigger the ""next cycle"" or was it the back-up plan when Jonas could not stop his father's death, but instead allowed it to happen? Season 3 should clear this up. 

I suppose my real question will ultimately be: Is this all made up in Jonas' mind as he's insane and if he's insane, why? We're lead to believe Mikkel hung himself to make Jonas and vice versa, so Mikkel's death, once Jonas knows the reasoning behind it, has no more reason for PTSD and the other items you presented, because there was a basis in time for it happen. It wasn't a senseless act of despair. Just as Ulrich and Egon seem to suffer from subconcious issues or perhaps repressed memories (deja vu), so to does Jonas and Mikkel. Both know something isn't 'right,' but they can't figure it out. It isn't until Jonas sees Mikkel that both understand and Claudia is also then present. We also gain clarity into Ulrich/Egon foils as well. 

This ying & yang pervades everything we witness because they are both present to allow events to unfold ""as they always have."" I'm more inclined to believe that the reason people behave like they do is so that things happened as they do. We see this very clearly between Ulrich/Egon & Jonas/Mikkel, but we also extend this thinking to Ulrich/Hannah or Claudia/Egon or Charlotte/Noah and so on. These 'emotions' and subconscious issues lead to the unfolding of time events as we witness them; without them, we do not have guides to allow the cycles to continue. Certainly people in Dark do not respond to direct commands, requests, or other items.

""Making things happen"" does so through events, painful or otherwise. It's Peter's infidelity. It's the book in time from HG Tannhaus. It's Claudia killing her father (accidently). It's Ulrich losing Mad's, seeking him out as a despondent, nihilistic teen, then as a father re-experiencing the very pain HE ultimately created by seeking out Helge in the past."
TheExpanse,fekksww,t3_epjyw6,1579202121.0,"30,000 foot view, this is where Amazon is superior (and Netflix) to most platforms out there, such as HBO, Comcast/Xfinity, etc. 

1) When I'm logged in to shop on Prime, the analytics and AI have various pop-ups with the latest season of something I may like. While I'm in watching say, All or Nothing (football), I'm simultaneously seeing ads and pops for the Expanse and similar shows. 

2) Platform suggestions. When I'm on Netflix or Prime, both platforms suggest similar content I may like and do a far better job of 'freely' advertising the latest season of something. Conversely, my Xfinity advertising depends on the branded channel, so if I'm watching the NFL playoffs, I'm not likely to see something I may like unless the show/network spent thousands if not millions for a 1-2 minute spot. It was obviously very costly to pitch the Star Wars movies and last year when Game of thrones concluded I did see advertisements regarding the show on 'other networks.' However, I think a major reason we don't see what we may like is the lack of cross-section or overlap between networks.

Depending on what you like, you won't see it. If I'm watching the Olympics on NBC, as I was year's ago, I'm not seeing commercials for Mr. Robot, Goliath, The Expanse, Altered Carbon, etc. 

\-------------------------------

My hope is that a platform like Roku, which is totally agnostic to the streaming subs you have will 1) easily bundle your streaming subs like 'channels' and 2) provide suggestions based on the whole of your streaming subscriptions, to find you more of what you like, and less of what you don't. As it is, I jump in and out of subs still and would prefer to easily just get what I want on such a device. I think that's where Roku has a leg up on Amazon, as prime could get boxed out because they do provide content, making it a competitor to other major players, where Roku isn't. 

Netflix, until other providers jumped in, was a win because it had bundles of content across platforms, subsuming much of the need to have a major subscription; you just got so much for such little money. Now, Netflix is losing the appeal of other content and creating it's own content, making it more a competitor to other platforms. 

It might be a far cry to suggest Comcast/Xfinity are 'dead', but they are dying and I don't see how this trend changes. The 'cost' of their product is quite high, the tech is inferior, yet they run the pipes to most homes in the country. When my home was built, I had to call for services and connection. Today, as long as I have internet/wifi, I'm good. Much of what is done is redundant and unnecessary. The likelihood is that internet costs go up long-term, as the cable providers are not wont to lose that much revenue simply b/c we cord cut."
TheExpanse,fe91izg,t1_fe6ex16,1578933207.0,"The OP and other's hit upon what makes streaming a superior platform, even beyond advertising, of which Prime and Netflix have to do very little. 

I merely log in to my account and either the algorithm pushes it as a 'suggestion to me' or when I'm navigating for prime purchases, I'm bombarded with advertises (and that's ok). Cable platforms (I'm on Xfinity, only option in my area) is a one-track, tv-on advertisement. I can be on reddit as I am now and quietly have either site up without disturbing anyone. I can add the show to my watch list for later and not forget it. 

I've yet to see Xfinity/Comcast or Verizon be able to pivot like the streaming platforms are. My Roku player is also far superior to the Comcast Platform, working on WIFI, it doesn't require complex 'in the wall' wiring to ensure I can leave the attachment somewhere and still operate the device. Consumers today desire smaller homes, more compact areas and if they have kids or pets, do not want large, cumbersome 'entertainment' centers that are hard to place. At least with streaming + streaming players, you get the best of everything and introduction to new shows/movies.

I bought the first (3) books after having binged the Expanse up to S3. I can't fault the advertising model that the old networks have, however, HBO and other's (as good as it is) are at a huge disadvantage when it comes to Netflix and Prime. Heck, if HBO had given Game of Thrones to Prime, or maybe Netflix, it would have been done right, because of all the seamless cross-selling that could go on and ease of access available. Mind you, prime members pay about $119/yr. HBO is around $10/month, maybe $12. Certainly a slight boost to either platform could see content on par with HBO produced and more easily distributed and accessed. 

I love the heck out of Westworld on HBO and HBO continues funding it, but outside of me pushing it, who else is diving in to it? I don't think I'd ever here of a 'great' show' on a traditional network, even today. I just don't keep my tv on to 'see it' and with commercials, if I DVR something, I push through it. With football, I'll put on Redzone or NFL SUNDAY TICKET, because the Pat's games with commercials are so long. The hope here is the model expands and gives us better content through these platforms. I could foresee a provider like HBO, possibly selling out to a netflix or amazon prime, if only for the purposes of their distribution and nearly 'free' advertising."

When Al-Anon teaches ""facing the consequences of their actions,"" in my experience it meant recognizing this was alcoholism, inasmuchas my wife would deny it, her trying treatments, having slips, her going back to drinking, then realizing it is sobriety and treatment that lead to wellness. 

I hate to say it, but rehab was almost a sunk cost of ""well we tried it, but it didn't work"" thing, because anytime I involved outside influence, including her parents, my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or siblings, everyone knew better, so they thought, but no one had experience, read a book from AA or bothered with Al-Anon. Everytime my wife was quite bad off and I'd leave, her parents would be incredulous about ""how could you leave her, she could hurt herself?""

Such people never follow things to their logical conclusion. At some point I'd have to leave her to go to work and bring our son to school (to my knowledge I've not yet won the lottery), and more importantly, who am I to stop her from doing this to herself? I'd bring her the ER, seven times in 2019, most of which were with a Blood Alcohol Level at .45 or as high as .60, and while the med staff was aghast at such a level, the most they'd do is refer her to behavioral health clinicians/doctors and send us on our way. Things got so repetitive that toward the end of 2019 when I'd bring her, they'd see her records and not even bother. She was checking herself Against Medical Advice, taking an uber home or convincing a neighbor to break her out, only to go back to the same state. 

I think we all face similar situations, albeit slightly different, too. Having been here since last year, which was the start of my recovery, I can see how I thought there'd be some holy grail to get her well. That didn't matter. *I HAVE TO BE WELL,* always, whether I'm with her, or not. That's the gift I give me. It doesn't mean I'm not anxious, upset or frustrated when she does what she does, but how I handle those slips do matter ultimately to me, and our son. 

Having seen people who 'retire' by 60 and then are afflicted with Dimentia/Alzheimer's, I stopped with the 'woe me, poor me,' chant. Last year my other was also cleared of cancer and back in 2015 my dad survived blood infections and major heart surgery, so I have many blessings in my wife, and my wife's alcoholism brought me to get help at Al-Anon and with counseling, when I probably otherwise wouldn't have. It's made me a better father, one I might not have been otherwise, really awakened me as a human to 'life', people's struggles and truly humbling me before God and humanity. 

Weekends when my wife would 'check out and relapse', I'd keep doing things, attend church, visit family, and more. Yet, I grew up in a household where my mom did everything and dad just worked and did 'men things;' he didn't really engage in activities, plans, or sports. He'd attend them, but more in the background, as a hanger-on, than active parent, planning such things. 

When my wife signed our son up for swim lessons, she intended to take him. After a few weekends of drinking, she couldn't committ and I knew I couldn't trust her, so I took over. She also signed him up for kickball and soccer, and many of those practices or games she missed being sick/drunk or being kicked out of the house at rehab or her parents and I took over with no fail. I signed him up for skiing too and regardless of what she does, I'm all good. 

Things are to the point, ""I don't need her, but I want her,"" and the longer this continues, the less likelihood of any semblance of a relationship will exist, because I figure I've been almost a 'single dad' for nearly 4 years. While she's been here, I haven't been able to rely on her for an appreciable amount of time and one of the major reasons I 'chose' her was because I felt less confident or helpless, so I thought my wife and her parents would give me the confidence in life I didn't have. This proved wholly false, since I've confronted it all head-on, and unlike her parents who pressed us into marriage counseling and treatment, they never went, even though my wife's counselors and med staff recommended Al-Anon and counseling for the parents, too. 

I no longer 'hope' for improvement or hang my life on needing improvement. It is what it is and I'll face it accordingly. Life's too short. In the span my wife has wasted figuring this out, my son has gotten 4 years older, gone from a baby to a little fun boy, my dad is 66, mom is 65, nana died, uncle died, and business has grown. The world keeps spinning and it's her choice to be a part of it or not, but I will enjoy the ride regardless. 

Good luck to you and your's and keep coming."
AlAnon,fdkk7zo,t3_eln18w,1578505353.0,"Are you me, in the future or past? Husband here, 39, one kid, 4 years old, wife, 35, who's been awful the past 18 months or so. 

I first want to say I'm sorry for what you are going through and have gone through. 

Second, I applaud you doing what you can, for the best interests of your family. 

I'm going to speak from experience. I was in your shoes about a year or so ago, and then some. Up to that point, I never wrapped my head around 'alcoholism' or what to do about it. Everything changed when we met a wonderful LADC named 'Joanne.' We met with Joanne on a Saturday morning while our son was at my wife's grandparents. She was referred to us by our marriage counselor and had the 'full scoop' on my wife. 

Within 5 minutes of meeting my wife and I she said: ""Honey, you get to AA today, Rehab for 30 days, your husband gets to Al-Anon and then we meet after you've begun Recovery. Otherwise there's nothing else to talk about. I've counseled alcoholics for 30 years, while you are different, much is the same, and this is where the road starts."" 

As it happened, my wife was using as we went to that meeting, drank after it, and we'd pick our son up and my wife was 'off' then, too. My wife didn't fold one bit on her advice, and things got worse, way worse. She went on a heavy binge for a week, placing me as a full 'single dad' through halloween into November 2018. At that point, her parents and I thought we could force, convince, persuade, plead, beg, etc, my wife/their daughter into treatment recovery. And she went, at least for 30 days at great cost. Within 1 week of leaving treatment, she relapsed and that relapse nearly killed her when she combined it with sleeping meds. She then re-entered the same treatment facility and did a follow-up IOP for 30 more days, at great cost, ending around February 2019.

Since then, she's been the ER 7 more times, all with a BAC over .45 (sometimes .60). I've written about my situation on this sub many times over. The 'awakening' I had came when I thought rehab would be the 'end all, be all' (cure all) needed and it was but a step in the process. Even this past December my wife had 2 major binges lasting about 2-3 days and another binge around 1/2-1/4. Each time, the quantity of booze grows, from (3) pint vodka bottles to (5). I don't stop her. I don't try to find it, except to lessen my burden of having to call the ambulance or clean up after her. 

I will say that my wife going through this misery of doing 'recovery' and failing is what's pushing her to REALLY trying to succeed. Last year 2019, she'd talk the talk, but never walked it. Even after two rounds of rehab, she never bought in. Now, even though she slips up, she bounces back, she wants to be with us, she gets into reading her AA books, spiritual books, and this past 'slip' although I found 4 bottles, a 5th bottle was full and in the trash. She'd spent the day and night after heavy consumption throwing up everywhere and came to enough to make that choice. 

Somehow, I 'get' it more that we have to leave them to their own devices and make the best choice for us. I certainly wouldn't be here right now if my wife wasn't making an attempt and desire to be sober, in recovery and beyond. A year ago, I'd thought, perhaps like her parents and other's who don't dig into the details, that Rehab/Recovery would do it. Or AA would do it. Or a book or another LADC, or the perfect IOP would do it. Her dad would often say ""we just have to get her somewhere, the right person, something, we have to try,"" and yet, it was like leading a horse to water, but that horse still wanted to drink vodka. She didn't want to face 'why' she drank, which she is now facing.

I'd long ago told myself and continue to do so that her attitude and willingness matter most. My wife is also reading ""The Naked Mind"" which she really enjoys as a more modern day approach to the AA books that has more rational, conversational approach to what's going on. It could be total bunk, but she isn't drinking most days and since we've insulated ourselves from her drinking (full time expensive daycare, finances, etc), there isn't much left for my wife to do but get well or I will eventually leave. She can be a mother always, but she won't be effective if she isn't sober. And she is someone I will always love and cherish, but if she isn't even able to take care of herself, there's nothing left over for us. 

I also didn't know how to have the talk. I never set MY boundaries. My boundaries became...

1) daycare so I didn't have to rely on my wife. extending myself to include support from my parents, her parents and friends. I didn't hide what as going on, and I also didn't make it worse or enable. I used to give into the fighting and engage back, so I felt bad asking for help because I thought it was me or she'd have something to justify her drinking. When I stopped giving in to that, I knew I could reach out to people and the vacuum it left meant it was only the drinking. 

2) I sought all practical pathways for support, from attorneys, to LADC, to personal counseling, Al-Anon, to rehabs, to the local police, to the state child services division. I've done everything in my power. Our finances are insulated from her grabbing money that would bankrupt us or give her weeks of binging. 

3) At times, I've taken the keys or locked her out, if I thought she crossed boundaries or would drunk drive. I've had this conversation elsewhere, but the FIRST and most crucial point is providing a safe place for our children/child to live and be raised. Nothing is more damaging to children than anxiety, fear, stress and anger/arguments. If my wife wouldn't or couldn't leave, I'd leave and had places to go, or would temporarily leave if my wife was unfit to be around. Most of the time, she was in bed and would stay there. 

I really don't know what the future will bring. I live one day at a time as we all only can. I feel more awakened on the other side of much of this, but even last year, I couldn't have envisioned the 'tunnel' through which I've gone and come out the other side. Even last year when my wife was in Rehab through XMAS and New Year's, I thought for sure she'd come out and really be sober and 'get it.' She even kept up IOP for another 3 weeks at great cost, until she stopped and still relapsed. Her attitude has certainly changed and in my mind, that's where 'recovery' starts; a clear, sober, recovering mind that wants to get well, wants to think and react and behave and cope differently."
AlAnon,fdecmux,t1_fd6cc6l,1578336106.0,"Given the high incidence of drunk driving that claim lives, the 5k-10k penalty to an alcoholic, that is their responsibility ultimately, is a small price to pay to save lives and maybe force rock-bottom. Granted, I don't know someone's situation nor their budget and for most that's a steep price, but if the cost is 5k-10k to save someone's life, so be it. 

Again, Al-Anon does have the philosophy in many of their readers that ""you won't make the chaos worse, nor will you stop the chaos from happening,"" but that also means acting within the scope of your higher power and making that call doesn't mean we save a life or cost that money, but it does mean being proactive. 

Too many times this year I could have left my wife to probably get worse or die, but I took her the ER or called 911, at great cost. Maybe I forestalled her rockbottom, maybe I saved her life; I don't know. What I do know is I saw someone similarly comatose in their car passed out, possibly sick or dying, I'd call 911. I did what a reasonable person would, not a self-ish person would, who has a vested interested, or biased perspective.

If you knew or saw a stranger driving drunk or acting erratically, you'd call the police, no?

This is where boundaries must come in, otherwise a family is enabling and acting out of fear. By NOT calling the police in a situation we normally would, we are not having this person face consequences you and I otherwise would face in the real world. Also, we are probably granting someone a haven to continue their drinking and by supporting the home, either with money, a job or watching the kids, we are partially or wholly enabling them to continue their drinking in a way they otherwise couldn't do so. 

While Al-Anon doesn't have to tell me what to do or prescribe me methods, it's the only place with actual real life examples of what to do. I've personally been to the police, every type of treatment program, hospital, here, Al-Anon, counseling, LADC, State Health Services, doctors, ER, and so on, and most just push it back to me, Al-Anon, God and attorneys. Mental health and addiction issues fall right back to the individual, especially the one's in our role. Most are looking for guidance, practical examples. While it won't always go that way and we seek serenity, we also can't be passive participants if there are lives at stake. 

If I know my wife is driving drunk, you best know I'd call the cops, because she could hit a kid, hit a bus, or whatever. That's on her. DUI or not. Maybe she finally gets well? Maybe it's the proof I need to gain custody? Maybe it's my wake up call? Maybe not?

Either way, we don't know. But sitting back and letting a drunk drive if we know it and have proof...no way. I'd call a person out publicly, I'd do the same for a loved one who could jeopardize your life."
AlAnon,fd6b7qb,t3_ek4ezb,1578188316.0,"My wife has and I confirmed with my town PD that I can and should call the police if I suspect she's driving under the influence. That is all the probable cause the police need to pull a car over without initial cause. Confirm with your town/city if such an act is legal and if so, do it.

I'd attended al-anon meetings where people didn't understand the practical application of such facets. While it isn't the place nor forum for such talk, people did banter about 'what to do if an alcoholic (Q) was expected or suspected of being drunk'....should we stop them? If so, how so? Some people commented they'd take the keys, block them in, or offer to drive. 

None of that matters, ime. In my wife's case, I was giving myself boundaries and detachment. She claimed to be attending AA meetings while our son was at daycare and I was at work. As it happened, we passed by each other in an area we shouldn't have while I did the drop off for daycare one day, I went to call my wife as I knew it was her car and she didn't pick up. I then trailed her and she evaded me. I knew she likely went the store for more booze and was going to head home as soon as possible. I beat her home and locked all doors. I did this because I had let her in many times before and she was so drunk I had to 911 or drive her the ER for medical treatment. When I spoke to the police, my only state options were either 1) leaving her 2) her seeking treatment and sticking to it on her own 3) her hitting rock bottom legally, either through divorce, crime, etc."
AlAnon,fcye1ln,t3_ej7d40,1578078678.0,"After learning what it means to 'drink alcoholically' I was a heavy binge/social drinker up until 2-3 years ago, when I gave it up almost entirely. My wife is an alcoholic, possibly suffering from other mental health issues only compounded by the drinking. My father is a functioning alcoholic who will consistently drink 2-3 large glasses of wine everyday (boxed wine) and will start early on weekends (noon) or right when he gets home. It's his go-to drink, only sparingly drinking water or coffee, and believing he has no problems, ""unless a doctor tells him to quit or tapper."" He knew 5 years ago it was a problem, when he was in the hospital, on his death bed from a blood infection, going through withdrawals. He went back into it only a few months after recovering. Underneath it all he's a good man, and a good dad, there any time I need him. My wife on the other hand....a good person with the worst of it.

I recognize my drinking in college was on the boarder of binging with many hangovers last a full day. In my 20's, I'd party at clubs, bars, go out with the guys, meet girls, drive drunk, have my mult-day hangover and keep it going. I'd camp with friends and set aside 4-8 12 packs of summer beer and also grab some cheap low vol Rum for the mult-day camping trips. Every friend interaction was drinking around a fire pit, sports or family. In my late 20's, early 30's, my wife's social life and connection was drinking. Drinking during special shows, drinking during cookouts, family events, going out to dinner, apps, or just stopping ""somewhere cute to grab a drink."" 

Now, I hate it. I abhor it. It's an 'acquired taste' for me, and since I stopped drinking so long ago, I no longer crave it, desire it, or miss it. I think of all the lost money, wasted workouts, sleepless horrible nights, and stress spent on figuring out what I'd drink with my then gf, now wife. That much is over. Most of my family, except my dad has cut back to nil. My wife's parents all but stopped and will decline offers of alcohol. My wife's sister is also an alcoholic, but with somewhat less wear and a smaller 'resume' of offenses and mistakes. 

Looking through clearer eyes, I see no reason to. Even when I'd try to have an IPA or two a few years back at home, when my wife was passed out and son in bed, I didn't like it. After 1, I'd feel weird in the head in a way I didn't like. Looking back on my dating years, the most desirable women I could have pursued and dated didn't really drink or didn't want to be on a date at a bar. They were in-shape, career-minded and wanted to actually DO things, not just sit and consume alcohol and food and late night calories. 

That life of partying, bars and what not, is empty. When I met my wife and it is hypocritical to say, there wasn't much beyond the take out food, parties, happy hours and social events. Even now, so much of what she knew her life to be is gone. She has no career any longer; she lost her job. Because of the drinking, her hobbies are minimal. She'll claim to want to ski and learn to golf, but neither happen because she only makes 3-4 weeks of sobriety then falls backwards, hiding it all behind lies. 

Mine was unhealthy because my 'models' of what was a fun time were my dad (alcoholic), uncle (alcoholic) and my wife (alcoholic). Everyone is from a good family, had or has a good job, and so it was an insidious disease packaged as a socially fun way to relax. My hope is to show my son enough fun he doesn't want to drink. Or, by focusing on health, working out, and being active, the need won't be there."
AlAnon,fcxttzb,t3_ej8wjc,1578070352.0,"I've been in your shoes and was there with our now 4 year old (back then my son was a few months to a few years). When I had no clue of the disease I was facing, I'd be goaded into her need to engage in constant battle to justify her drinking and also that her bad feelings were \*her responsibility.\* 

My need to be a solid role model for my son, Al-Anon, counseling, daily readings of Al-Anon approved literature and reaching out for support guided me from darkness to light. My wife still slips up, binges, relapses and misuses alcohol, but I no longer express myself and am goaded into anything. I can't claim to be perfect, but awakening to the realization that if often while we suffer as much or more, quite often in secret, the kids end up identifying the well parent/spouse as the 'bad guy,' made me realize I had to change ME. 

On rare occasion in the past I'd lost my coolness, threatening to kick her out, move out, close down the home, or a number of other ultimately ineffective threats, none I followed through on. Perspective is one part of what's helped me. Perspective to realize ""everyone has something."" Perhaps not now, maybe it's later, but no family is Facebook perfect. Some families face cancer. Other's face alzheimer's/dimentia. Maybe the marriage just dissolves through infidelity or being tired of marriage. Still other's may face rare, random, young deaths, as several in our time have. 

I've tried to realize that while this is a struggle at times, there are also blessings. I have my son, because of my wife, his mother. She \*is\* trying; even if at times she slips up, lies, etc. That I can teach my son how to be resilient in the face of challenges, no matter what life throws at you. But also when it comes time to pack it up, I have to be ready to call it quits, too. 

I can't tell anyone how to be and my way isn't the right way, but I know parents who aren't patient either, and don't necessarily face the drinking issues we might. Rather, maybe they face other unknown issues. Point is, life throws something at us, that we can take at face value or we can work on our selves. 

Now, when my wife is off, she normally goes to bed. In the off case she's unwell publicly or in our home during the day-time, I'll manage it. Maybe I'll not go home until night time and instead go to an indoor park, movie theatre, or visit family. I may put on music, call family, or watch a show. We'll take a drive. I deflect away as if it isn't happening, because it isn't. I've had to re-arrange my life to be almost entirely independent from my wife, too. Daycare is full-time and my work schedule reflects being a full-time breadwinner and full-time parent/dad. I'm the parent our son goes to in the morning, and who he calls at night if he has a bad dream, wants water, wets the bed (still training) or just wants a hug. He calls us 'dude bros' and 'best buds' and when he's building with legos or doing a project, I'll sit and watch. Any house chores, snow-blowing or number of things needing to be done, I typically do at night when he's in bed around 7pm, ipod and headset on, until around 9pm. I'll focus on reading, prayers, or connecting with family/al-anon, too. 

No matter how my wife is, I have to be ok, for my son, and for me. My wife may never get well, as I've watched the progressiveness of the disease consume her. 2019 was her worst year yet, spending 7 visits in the er, ranging from a full week, to 1-3 days, tallying medical bills over $30,000 (of which she is paying 10k), on top of losing her job. Yet, I've insulated myself as best I can financially and personally, and have consulted with an attorney. The hard part is staying or going, which I'm taking day, by day. My wife makes it 3-4 weeks and crashes and burns through bad behavior, bad moods, and many markers that look eerily like ""boarderline personality disorder"" (googling the 9 symptoms reveals she has nearly all of them, all of the time). 

If there's anything Al-Anon has done to me, it's restored my sanity, serenity and given me hope in the darkness, to be a light for myself and my son. Without it, I'd be flailing about, probably hurting him in the process and perpetuating the cycle of alcoholism. As it is, I'm read From Survival to Recovery. While an older book, the early pages demonstrate how the children of alcoholic families are often ignored by one or both of the parents, while the 'healthy' parent suffers and is distracted.

It's a tough role, but I've removed myself from my wife's bad behavior, drinking or moods. Now, as mentioned, if she's off, I pack it up. Go to bed. Watch a show. Anything to dis-engage. If kids are there, depending on the time, I plan accordingly. Again, i'm not perfect, would never claim to be, but I don't think people outside of this subreddit would get what we go through. Thank God for Al-Anon, and keep coming."
StarWars,fc3bjz5,t1_fc2pfhf,1577386153.0,"This I agree with, though I think it would be a very challenging medium to get this across through traditional media like movies in theatres. Disney Plus is the perfect platform to cover these areas in detail, then do something large and epic on the big scream, as we've seen to really vault the storyline along. 

A show like the Walking Dead has spanned nearly 10 years now, for good or ill, and something similar could possibly be done on streaming platforms that hopefully opens up new worlds in all media yet unexplored. I'd long hoped for 'The Dark Tower' to be made available properly on any stream platform, but it's yet to have happened, even though we have similar dark shows on a variety of stream platforms. 

As you mentioned, Disney+ could go on ad infinatum with the content they own and could produce. 

Seeing as how it's a business, though, and the $ do ultimately drive this, the movies are going to exist like this where it spins out major characters and licensing materials that major fans probably won't like - certainly it's what I would do, as it's what will pay the bills, invest in the parks and drive people to buy-up to Disney+ and stay invested. The more people consume, the more Disney would ultimately do. Again, for good or ill. 

I came of age to 4, 5, 6, and the fact we have this much content is mind-blowing. I never got into the EU, but I did watch each episode on repeat, nearly daily for an entire year, just wanting 'to exist and absorb' all things SW. Now, there's (2) parks dedicated to it, a channel chock full of content, tons of licensing via Legos, and so many spin-offs, cartoons, etc, that I can't even count. The world now is so much more immersive than it ever was back in the 80's when I came up with SW. It's exciting times all around for those who enjoy such material."

fantasyfootball,fbddhh2,t3_ecf07m,1576758510.0,"The guy who won our league actually had neither CMC nor LJ, instead he had Pat's D, Godwin, and Aaron Jones. As those guys were 'hot' through the 1st 10 weeks, he was able to ride out lucky pick-ups off Waivers to ride into the promised land. The way Godwin, Pats and Jones played, on top of having a stable, sometimes awesome Aaron Rodgers, gave him an incredible floor. 

The guy in our auction league who had CMC, also had Wilson, SF defense, Landry, Parker and Ertz.

The guy who had LJ, also had Mandrews, Ingram, Carson, Julio Jones and Keenan Allen...and still they came in 2, 3rd.

Match-ups matter most, then seeding, then ultimately, how performs at the end. 

I calculated the guy who won the league this year and last, got off to a hot start and when those starts fizzled, had pivoted into the mid-late season up and comers, in this case AJ Brown, Tyler Higbee, Kenyan Drake, Ryan Tannehill, etc. 

I was torpedoed by OJ Howard for 4-5 weeks and didn't grab Dissly or Higbee or Everett when I could have. I had Golladay and Evans, so I didn't draft much more depth at WR when Stafford went down and didn't leap on AJ Brown or Devante Parker or DJ Chark when I could. I had Kenyan Drake and dropped him b/c I thought Ronald Jones would prove a better 'value' given his success, team and opportunities (all the stat geeks @ PFF had ROJO at some potential break-out candidate WHEN he'd get the 20 touches...). With Drake, when he finally hit, I could have won those weeks. 

My team never got going, even with Barkley late-season, Miles Sanders finally getting going with Howard down. I held onto rooks too long, like Darwin Thompson, Alexander Mattison, Darrell Williams and other's. 

It's been a HUGE learning curve in our league where I drew:

1) Draft well gives you a HOT start; manage well and you win the league, possibly.

2) Be ready to pivot. Devante Parker and AJ BROWN emerged b/c their QB changes positively impacted their situations. That's noticeable and metrics won't show it. That positive change also impacted at least Derrick Henry, who was a solid RB2 in the 1st half and RB1 in the 2nd half. 

3) Draft depth out the gate. ""WE don't know what we don't know."" At my draft I grabbed Matt Ryan and Jared Goff. Unfortunately, Goff regressed and had the same bye week as Ryan. I did end up dropping Goff mid-season which helped tank another team. I did not grab a 'growth' QB like Lamar Jackson, and I did have him in our re-draft league last year, b/c I kept listening to 'FURU podcasters' say he couldn't make the hard throws, never realizing the cheat code of his legs. He went for $1-2 in our auction league, where the pool is $230 (so HUGE value) and the guy had carson wentz all season on his bench. 

4) THINK IN BETS - go get this book. Looking back, at least in our league. I'd rather have Derrick Henry, Dalvin Cook, Chris Carson, Nick Chubb and Mark Ingram, than Saquon Barkley or Alvin Kamara. In our auction league, those 1st 4 went for $20-40 each, very easily do-able, though may not next season. Saquon, CMC, and Kamara went for $75 and Zeke and Gordon for $50, given their over hang and contract hold-outs. Unfortunately, it's guys like Bell, Brown, Roth, Michel, and Juju, that really crushed teams. It's more important on who NOT to draft than who is to DRAFT. Locking up and spreading many bets around guys that could emerge makes more sense, because ""we don't know what we don't know."" I'd draft (2) TEs, that are elite, b/c our rosters are small and getting 15-30 points (kittle, waller, hooper, henry) really out shines what you can plug n play at TE off waivers. I'd draft 3-4 top WRs just in-case, because you never know who emerges. I'll draft 2 qbs who can provide a solid floor and maybe try for Kyler Murray or lock down a good asset that's undervalued. AT RB, it makes sense to also spread bets there, because one of the mid-round backs may be next year's CMC, such as Kamara, Chubb, Jacobs, or really any 2-3 down back, esp. if they catch passes. 

The teams who 'hedge their bets' at the draft fair better, then they can build around a good draft via waivers or trades. If I go ALL in an elite guy, I'm banking I'm 1) right about that situation AND 2) that i'll be able to grab the next few lottery tickets off waivers/FA OR be able to pick right week to week. I'd rather lock up targets and touches in the draft OR opportunity where talent/skill will emerge, than dig deep.

5) Rookies. These are late-season plays, IMO. If 2020 is like 2019, next year's team of Sanders, Singletary, Monty, Jacobs, will be RB2's, maybe RB1 at times. However, in 2019, coaches aren't all-in given trying to save the back for the playoff/late-season push AND how rookies tend to adjust to blocking, etc. I went heavy on Rookies (Justice Hill, DT, AM, Miles Sanders) and it was a blackhole on my roster and bench. I couldn't drop him, but the production was weak, too."
alcoholism,f9ujzyk,t1_f9u88ub,1575652322.0,"Thank you for the response and the blunt, critical commentary. I'd like to think everything I've done IS for him and the primary reason I've kept going is so we could or may have a whole household some day. 

I reached out to the local police for support and guidance.

I've interviewed several attorneys on advice, direction and guidance, as well as my rights and responsibilities as a father and what I should do, if anything. I retained one attorney if the day arises I need to act.

I spoke with my son's Pediatric Doctor about what's gone on, who was also my wife's primary doctor for many years before she changed doctors. He was the doctor who initially diagnosed her (maybe falsely) with Post-Partum depression and prescribed 5-20mg of lexapro. I updated him on the status of life, our son, they did a check on our son and provided us with access to a Pediatric Social Worker through their practice who I had a consultation with. 

I attend Al-Anon in person and online, as well as read materials daily. 

I am personally at a counselor on a weekly basis. 

Our neighbors and all of our family are well in the know on my wife and at the first glimpse of her relapse or use, we have plans, whether it is visit someone, have someone over, or remove her from the home. 

What my son knows at 4 is that ""mommy was sick"" and ""mommy was on a work trip,"" at which point we visited her. When my wife is drinking, she is confined to a bed and we let her sleep. Her abuse is almost entirely toward me in privacy, which makes it all the better and worse. I bear all of it, which makes it seem like to most, it isn't occurring. 

In the younger years, my wife was drunk at dinner or so, but that was before I knew what it was and/or took steps to detach and move on. 

She's lived for extended periods of time away from us, up to 30 days on several occasions. We've had the state child services in, with whom I have spoken and are on terms with if needed. While I read how some spouses/parents are, if my wife was ever that way toward our son or was misbehaving publicly, she'd be gone. 

The last relapse this week occurred at night, after our son was in bed, and she slept away the morning, never rousing once. Either way, whether divorce or together, I'd be harming him. The process of splitting the household 'hoping' it fixes things may do more harm than good and staying together may be no better or worse - I do not know. I'm an open book to all sources, resources, legal, medical, and family, when in some cases I don't have to, because it's all about my son.

If I ever catch a whiff that she isn't 100%, we don't come home, or we go to work together. He's in full-time school, 9-3, then I get him or if she's well, she may. On weekends it's 100% me if need be. If I felt there was damage, and our doctors, lawyer, and counselors advised as such, I'd be gone, because I asked them as much about 'what to do.'"
alcoholism,f9u548x,t1_f9sosnp,1575644539.0,"Thank you for writing this post. As a husband to an alcoholic wife, your story eerily sounds like her's. She now drinks the 750ml bottles (2 of 'em) as they're easier to hide and perhaps gives her a boundary not to go over and get too sick. 

I wish she'd see the light you've seen. I'm not mad at her, I'm hurt and frustrated with it, just as I would be if it was a binge-drinking college roommate...at some point the luster of partying, being a caretaker and intoxicated wears off. I still hear ""well you owe some responsibility, I'm taking accountability, you have too as well."" This, after she relapsed Saturday into Sunday AM, and bounced back. However, anytime she feels anxious, depressed, or whatever, her go-to is the 750ml and perhaps some wine to top it off. She's checking out, because she can't face it. 

I don't think she realizes that long-term it takes time to taper off and come back to a sense of normalcy, clear-thinking, positivity and general well-being. Her default temperature would be negative, picky, anxious, depressed, or snappy. Lurking behind her words, her moods, her attitude, her mindset and outlook is one of the drinker, who views things as negative, to put people down because she feels worse, to be less than she's capable, to dim her light with booze."
AlAnon,f9r49p4,t3_e629uo,1575571047.0,"I can only liken it for me to a Frog boiling in a pot of Water. Initially, it's cold or room temperature, even with the heat on full blast. By the time it's hot enough to realize, you're cooked. If we (or I) knew this was looming on the horizon, we'd probably eject or course-correct ASAP.

My wife's situation is the very definition of progressive, denial-based alcoholism. 

When we got together over 15 years ago, I'd never really drank, except socially. I had no value or boundaries on drinking, except holidays or social events. In college, I'd drink alcoholically to hangover or stupidity, but no different (unfortunately) than my friends. When I moved out on my own around age 25 and met my then age 21 year old gf (now wife), I never drank alone or even at home. When I met her, all that changed.

We'd find all sorts of reasons to drink. Snowstorms. Bachelor/Bachelorette nights. Dinners out. Dinners in. Holidays. Grilling. Friends. Or, just the heck of it. In spite of our drinking, which I'd liken more to a hobby than anything, my wife was the complete opposite of what most might depict. Great family background, attends church regularly, would count her calories, workout daily, always attentive to family, her job, friends and other's. Most of those outward attributes were why I thought marrying her was such a slam dunk.

Then, over time, the progressive nature crept in. Leading up to our engagement, she'd have these crazy situations that surrounded drinking. One time we were in Vegas on a business trip for me and she'd got so drunk/buzzed her mood flipped and she walked off on me. I'd try to find her, calm her down, and she'd get more hysterical and dramatic. It lasted for hours and she made a good scene about it until I got her back to the room. She'd never spoke about or apologized for it; I should have known then.

On our honeymoon, ten days in St. Lucia, she got drunk/buzzed again to quite an extreme, she was similarly hysterical and dramatic to the point security parked themselves outside our nice villa. My wife stayed in our place for about 2+ days then until she emerged 'well' and hardly any accountability about what happened, no apology and no recognition of what occurred. I spent about 2 days alone, eating alone, swimming, reading books and away from her until she regained composure. 

That wasn't the worst of it though. My wife's alcoholism didn't truly kick off until about 3-4 months after our son (now 4) was born. She attempted to breast feed and once she stopped, I'd begun finding alcohol hidden in containers, pre-mixed, wine in tumblers of OJ, then vodka. She ramped up from chardonnay to vodka and now, if she relapses, she binges about 2 pints of vodka quick to 'check out.' The list of offenses, medical situations, police, is astounding. She's since lost her job as of November. She'd previously taken several FMLA leaves, multiple stints in Rehab, at least 7-8 visits to the ER requiring acute medical attention for dangerously high levels of intoxication (.45-.60 bac), and I've had the state we live in send child services TWICE due to my calling the ER/ambulance and thinking I'd left our son in her care unattended (I never did). The last four years can only be compared to a living hell, with her taking every extreme action and also being provided every opportunity to seek recovery. So far she'd recently went about 60 days of sobriety, relapsed and is now on day 4 starting over. 

My dad is also an alcoholic. Recognizing the signs, these are people in denial of reality who do not confront ""life on Life's terms."" My dad has been in the ER three times the past 15 years for MAJOR heart surgery (valve replacement) and each time he had horrible withdrawals, hallucinated but ultimately came back better than ever. He even stopped smoking, made major promises about his life moving forward and crept back into his old ways within 1-2 months of being out of the hospital. My dad's word is ""when the doctor tells me to stop, I will, but my vitals always come back great."" \[I honestly have no way of knowing and my mother has often said she is going to leave him soon if he doesn't shape up.\]

Alcohol is their coping mechanism and because of it's addictive nature, it's often game over for these people, supplanting normal, healthy and good ways of coping with life's issues and challenges. Even today, I find my wife invents things to be anxious, upset, or pissed about, lacking empathy and understanding or perspective. When she hits the hilt, she goes to the bottle. She finds ways to pick about things not even worth discussing, such as gift giving at XMAS, or if my brother will bring food when he visits, or who drives to pick our son up for a sleep over (us or my parents). My wife's disease is very much one of a spiritual nature, too, because she has the capacity to be GOOD, especially since she makes every effort to go to church and get up early and ""work on her"", but I also think because she does work so hard to be good, that's her struggle to avoid the creeping darkness within that will pull her back to the bottles. 

Given how AMAZING and life-changing having our son was, I wouldn't do a thing differently, though. I've had more happiness and miracles in the four years he's been alive, than the 35 before it. This situation isn't a curse, it's a blessing. It brought me to Al-Anon for me, and opened my eyes to my own issues and imperfections, and my relationship with alcohol and my father. Just one morning in particular, my son, 4 years old, walked in at like 4am and said ""Daddy, I love you."" He went up to my sleeping face, as I was half out of it, grabbed it, and spoke those words, in the pitch black of the early morning, then went back to bed. My wife woke up briefly as she heard his footsteps and said ""L What's wrong?"" ""Nothing, I just wanted to tell daddy I love him."" 

I wouldn't have this young miracle without her and with all of life's mysteries and wonder. I do believe in God and I believe the path we live isn't what we see on TV, in movies, or what we expect."
AlAnon,f9qo27l,t3_e6h7wt,1575564309.0,"""Emotional Hangover"" - every damn time. Great analogy and visualization. 

This is what \*I\* would let wreck my serenity and highlighted \*MY\* co-dependency of this disease. 

When I was at my peak and probably making things worse, any time my wife was 'off', I'd spend at least an hour searching for the hidden booze, while she slept, and so did our son. I may find it, I may not. If I did find it, I'd take pictures of it, broadcast it to her via Facebook, email, notify her parents at ungodly hours, call my parents for support, 'fear' how the next day may go (it was always a 50/50 toss up), and repeat each time she did. 

My wife isn't quite in lasting recovery, in fact she 'relapsed' this past weekend and while I did search for the booze AND found it, I did so during the heavy snow storms so I would not be taking her to the ER. My wife's drinking almost invariably leads to the ER, since she'll slug 1-2 pints of Vodka in a quick swoop, pass out almost unconsciously, and possibly need medical assistance (her BAC was teetering as high as .60 and averaging .45). 

Once I found it, I went to doing me. Watched Football. Read a book. Focused on work. Anything that brought me joy, because ultimately I could replace/insert Alcoholism/Drinking with cancer, alzheimer's, dimentia, or any number of issues. Not letting the trauma of drinking bother me is my awakening, whether I fail or succeed.

Because I kept it all to myself these past times and didn't give my serenity and power away to people who cannot help and do not understand, I felt A LOT better come Monday morning when she woke up. It was different than the other relapses. Unfortunately, for me, after four years, it's hard to see my wife as romantically and attractively as before, and to the random stranger, she's a beautiful mother/woman when she is sober and half-way put together or not done up at all. But knowing inside of her lurking is that alcoholic beast has been a recent struggle of mine to establish a romantic and sexual connection once more. It happens, in marriage, but hopefully not for decades and perhaps when someone isn't actually doing it to themselves, as is the case with my wife.

Having to witness her throw-up for hours on end, or in bed, or piss/crap herself has certainly been a blow to that spark between us. I'd hoped it could be re-ignited by at least working the steps or seeing a changed person emerge. Alas, that is not what is happening at the moment."

'My irrational' thought was ""Detroit can't run, esp. on the Bears, and Golladay is their best chance outside Jones"" so play him. My rational thought, also based on rankings, was Gallup, since Cooper would be covered heavily and Jerry Jones would want the Cowboys to go run up the score, at home, on thanksgiving. I've long held the mantra of ""play the studs no matter what"" but after watching Gallup and Anderson burn up my bench, I got cute and it blew up in my face. 

I subscribe and/or pay for services from 4for4, Chris Harris, Pff, and Football guys and they are all in lock step with each other, with very few takes. PFF I liked for pre-season and NFL draft coverage, Football guys had affordable DFS, Chris Harris has great takes on watching video and 4for4 had good articles that the other's didn't cover. I'd even listen to some of the JJ Zacharison FanDuel/Numberfire podcasts, too, but few really embrace the SMALL sample nature of football and total chaos about it. 

As I personally dig into the math, science, chaos and understanding of it all, I'm formulating my own decisions in 2020, as much of this lead me astray. 

\- missing out on Lamar Jackson; I had him last year toward the end of the season and he was bought for $1 in our auction league live draft, out of a pool of $220. HUGE steal and value. Biggest argument amongst most FF experts was ""he can't throw."" Psh...

\- Over-valuing most RBs and not weighing in properly on the RB risks outs there...DJ, Conner, Barkley, Gordon, etc. I hate to be a stickler, but reading books by Nassim Taleb and ""Thinking in Bets"" by Annie Duke will give greater perspective and thought on how to build lineups that may hit better. 

For example, Tight End was a dumpster fire this year and streaming worked out far better. So many FF experts focused on targets, but rarely HOW a TE was used. Dissly/Hollister had tons of plays that were built for them, so their production is there and I watched last night's game; Wilson loves throwing to Hollister, as he did Dissly, yet so many experts forced other TEs without better 'thought' or true analysis around who'd be used. I fell into the camp of drafting Howard and neither Howard nor Brate were useable, except for MAYBE DFS. 

Streaming Defenses is another key area ripe for the picking. I could go on, but why bother with FF sports if we're all going to default to 'what the experts' say?"
fantasyfootball,f9lcloe,t1_f9kn1tb,1575419808.0,"I'd attribute this more to David Tepper buying the team and wanting to clean the ship and go in a new direction than directly Ron Rivera, specifically.

Tepper only completed the purchase of the Panthers as of 5/22/2018, so it'd seem more likely he'd give the incumbent team a shot before making any upstart changes that blow it wide open. 

I don't know Tepper's management style, is it like Jerry Jones or Bob Kraft? Time will tell, but he has connections, respect, money, and resources that some franchises don't have, so I could envision he may want to bring a dash of 'moneyball/astroball' to the team/ownership this season and beyond. He may also want to bring in some of the more successful coaches in college or as OC/DC's given the assets they have. 

Ron seemed like a nice guy from watching the show, but they had their time back in in 2015 and perhaps ""River Boat"" Ron doesn't jive with Tepper's style."
AlAnon,f9enyxu,t1_f9cdny3,1575247269.0,"Thank you for writing this. It makes too much sense. My wife (q) an active alcoholic of many years spent the last 60 or so sober; she was at her parents for 30 and I let her back home about 30 days ago. All this after having spent the last year in and out of rehabs, AA, ER and more. Her 'go-to' bottles of choice are (2) pints of vodka + various nips or chardonnay. She downed all of it from last to day and has been vomiting all day/night. 

I'm at the brink of having to file for divorce, because I've run out of options. I either 'stand' and take it and 'hope' she gets her self together or how her lapses go is inevitably calling the ambulance or taking her the ER for her astronomical BAC of .45-.6. The last time I didn't, she was crapping/pissing herself in bed until I did. 

The pain inside her brain must be magnitudes larger than what she is doing to her body and her family to continue to sustain this spiral downward. Our 4.5 year old son knows ""mommy"" is sick and it's at the point I have to remove her because she isn't safe to herself or around us and the period leading up to full blown relapses she's toxic and encouraging a fight to justify her drinking (or she's been drinking and is just belligerent). 

I do prefer to hear from people such as yourself to awaken those of us who are probably still asleep at the wheel, co-dependent and/or suffering. The truth is real."
AlAnon,f8vm8ti,t3_e2gxk5,1574872611.0,"""Put your safety mask on first."" 

I found, when my wife was that bad this summer, I had to recognize how particularly bad it was, accept reality as it is, and do what any clear thinking person should/would/could do, prepare and be prepared that it's over. My wife has battled alcoholism hardcore for going on 4 years and this summer was particularly brutal, after she'd already spent a total of 90 days in rehab/detox. 

One particular week she'd stay drunk, I couldn't find the vodka or was working and with our son, and she'd get just sober enough to buy more. At the deepest parts of her binge, I'd never fathom she'd sober up enough to go to the store, lie about attending an AA meeting and pass out again. The time in mind was this past August as part of a birthday gift to my mother she wanted a beach day with all 3 of us and my dad and her. Well, my wife was nowhere near well enough to attend, complained of being sick and incapable of going to the beach, so she stayed home this particular Sunday. 

The horror show I returned to that night was beyond comprehension. She'd been pissing herself, throwing up, sweating and by morning, crapping herself in diarrhea. Our bed was a putrid mess that I could only compare to having watched my dog die of cancer when it lost it's bowels, wouldn't move, and was nearly comatose - that was my wife this Sunday evening when I'd left her to her own devices. I made the decision that night, that even though the horror didn't end, to fix this.

I had my mother take our son for the day (a Monday), cleaned her up, de-fumigated the house, laid out towels and ""Weekend at Bernie's""style walked her to the truck, garage, then hospital, all the while she's once again losing her bowels, pissing and crapping herself. I dropped her off at the ER only to return hours later when she might have sobered up and didn't. She spent several days in the hospital because her vitals were borked and she'd now taken to binging at least 2 liters of vodka everytime she binged. She HAD to get to a state where she checked out, so if the alcohol didn't take effect, she'd keep going until it did, which meant she'd drink to fatal levels. 

My wife was in the ER six times this summer, and I had to call the ambulance once just to get her there because it was 1130pm at night, our son was sleeping, and she was unresponsive. 

While she binged, I went to attorneys, the police, our son's primary doctor, and rallied myself to remedy 'what I could.' I had to find stability. I couldn't leave her to just 'be' and hope she'd get to a meeting, because I found myself still trying to 'save' her, stop her from killing herself, and interceding. The time I had to call the ambulance she lied about attending an AA meeting, left for 1-2 hours, came home at 630pm, immediately passed out in her truck and I left her there, to face her choices. Three hours later, she never moved and seemed worse off, in a hot garage and my nurse mother suggested given her state I should call the ambulance/police. 

I'd then continued researching options. As of now, my wife is about 50 days sober/recovery, but even this 2019 was a year from hell, when I'd thought 2018 was bad. I've made my mind up that given her her last shot, because I don't know if she can live up to her end of the bargain as a wife and mother. I cannot abide ambivalently letting her live her, enabling her bad behavior by providing food, shelter, and covering bills, while she drinks, binges and doesn't get help. 

So far, she has committed and stayed committed to recovery and in her defense, it's now been about 1 year that she is REALLY trying and committed to recovery, even if she's also had slip-ups and mis-steps. The prior three years, we were both ignorant, naive and un-educated about ALL this and frankly, now, she wants to. That doesn't mean maybe she won't slip up, but the fact if she did and she returned back to her recovery gives me hope. When she wasn't interested in recovery or accepting of Step 1, my only option in hindsight was kicking her out or leaving. 

I'd originally feared splitting the house up and our son not having his mother, but so many dinners during binges she'd spent drunk and I didn't realize. I then feared the financial consequences and her losing her job and our health insurance, which just happened, but I learned to earn more money, and insult myself from her mistakes. I'd rather a sober non-working wife, than a drunk working wife. 

People early into this warned me that it would be a long, hard road and still is. I've found the longer I'm on this, the bigger the scar goes, and the harder it is to see her in a different light, even if it's 50 days sober! I ""struggle"" with who she is, giving into the moments and letting my guard down and it will take time. People may have told me to leave, to divorce her and so many other paths, but I wasn't ready or accepting EITHER. I really can't tell anyone what they should do and I don't tell other's. I listen and try to hear what's said and isn't said. Even now, I tell myself I'd leave her if it happened again with no recovery in sight, and I may, but it's a HUGE decision to do that in my case. I'm working on getting over that fear for my own mental and personal health because I want to give of myself to a healthy marriage and life and show my son the same. I do not wish to keep feeding this beast of alcoholism if no best efforts are being made. 

Hope and prayers are with you at this most difficult of times."

At this point, I'd take 20 carries from Snell over 10 from ROJO, as I don't ever see Arians giving ROJO 20 this season, no matter what he says about 'lead back.' 

Also, Arians was the guy who wouldn't just hand over the reins to DJ when he was coaching, but rather eased him into the situation. 

My fear with PITT though is jsut how broken that offense is, and I know I'd feel like crap if Cook when down and I dropped an RB1 with no faab, but I'm also stockpiling that pick I might hit on. If Pitt will give 20 to Snell, maybe he's the lead winner."

> Saying that this is great is insulting.

I don't control my wife being an alcoholic or her sobriety. My cousin's life is out of his control when he was shot in the neck and became a quadriplegic. There have been many cases I've witnessed first hand where a doctor/hospital suggested aborting a child because of health complications or downs or another issue, and that did not come to pass. The child was in fact, healthy. 

Science is not God. It facilitates human existence, but it will not replace that. I don't think being born with complication is a blessing, but nor do I think it is a curse that a human being of relatively limited intelligence should be the final arbiter in deciding the life and death of another human being. That's what we are saying. 

I had a family client lose their oldest, downs child, 3 years ago, at the age of 40. He had no specific complications, instead it was cancer that took his life. Otherwise, while they had a child to care for all their life, it was not hard or a burden. No one in is guaranteed anything, least of all a life free of suffering. That's the point. 

I have a son. He is a child now. Maybe someday I am caring for him again, or maybe he chooses to take care of me as our ancestors did. Or, because addiction is running rampant through the country, maybe that is what takes a family or child. Who's to say? 

Yes, you abort the 'sick' child only to find if another could be conceived the next is an addict. What then? It gets back to the heart of the parable about the farmer...we do not know what is good or bad, or if it's a life of suffering or sacrifice? 

Contextually speaking, healthy and able-minded is entirely subjective. People who appear so on the outside could easily be struggling with anxiety, addiction, depression, or other mental health issues. They could be riddled with cancer unbeknownst to themselves."

I was in mass yesterday with a presentation by our priest, Father Brian. He spoke to the book ""Love your Cross: How Suffering Becomes Sacrifice"" and the author, Therese M. Williams, came down with Spinal Meningitis at 18 months old. For the past 43 years, she has been a Quadriplegic. While this wasn't at birth, it was life-altering. 

My business partner is 1 of 6. Two of his brothers had Down Syndrome at a time when detection was not possible (he's 63). One brother passed on in his 50's, the other is alive in his 60's. Two other brothers of the six died of alcoholism and cancer. There's (3) total left. His comment ""everyone should have a down syndrome family member or child."" 

His are the sweetest, most kind, loyal loving and genuine people. Caring for his siblings has not been a burden or challenge; it was a blessing.

She is now about 50 days sober, after four hard years of alcohol abuse, relapses, rehabs, living in a seedy motel, nearly dying three times, all starting just after she had our now our year old child (2015).

fantasyfootball,f8p5nxa,t1_f8o67h9,1574696080.0,"CMC IS the offense, though, until we see more stable QB play. He's undoubtedly top 5 and I hope for his sake and production it's Allen or Cam or a great Mahomes-like QB is drafted within the next 2 years, because seeing such a great talent like CMC and Barkley, get wasted with no ring is awful. 

I can't think of one team in the last 20 that's won a SB with a top tier RB and I'm thinking back to LT, Ahman Green, Priest Holmes, LJ...Maybe Tiki Barber and his RB1 years were a flash compared to the other's. 

Point is, we're at peak CMC because CAM isn't there vulturing TDs or passing more. We also have a rookie RB doing a ton of check-downs to CMC to make it happen. If the caliber of QB goes up, CMC production will inevitably go down. We saw some of the production shift to DJ moore this week and maybe had projected Curtis Samuel to have his break-out year. He's a total beast and I won't let that cloud my judgement next year, but if CMC goes to $80 in my auction league and Barkley falls to $50, I'm on it. 

We have to follow the year-end production too, as that hints at what might come next year. Mahomes, LJ, both telegraphed their breakout season, to a point. It's known that Jones is a true green rookie and the NYG line isn't great. I'm bummed as a Barkley owner, but he's still amazing and I paired him with Henry, Evans, Golladay, and made the playoffs. My Championship game is week 15 vs MIA, so if he wins me that, he's worth it. I've seen this 'script' before. Player has down year, comes back twice as hard, team reassesses in offseason and hopefully bolsters the talent around him to do like CMC. People will undervalue Barkley, overvalue CMC and the regression is there like it was for Mahomes and inevitably will be for LJ."

AlAnon,f7zmdvj,t3_dy3ncs,1574112838.0,"I felt like that, too, at the beginning and for 3+ years after. Now, if I even did it, would be to confirm what I know, file for divorce and leave. 

I wasted so many hours, nights and weeks of \*my serenity\*, chasing booze around, taking pictures of it, discarding it, throwing it at her in bed, scattering it around her in bed and taking a picture of her passed out like a sorority pledge, and so many other disdainful, silly, stupid and wasteful moments that I had to do that to learn how foolish and unproductive it is and was. 

Now, if I feel I have to, then I should just part ways. Not control her. Or move on. 

Again, as other's remarked, STEP 1. But that takes time and we have to fall, scrape our knee and learn to crawl, walk, then run. But for years, that's what I did. I'd suspect her drinking, looking around the house for an hour or two late at night, take a picture, panic, call my family to calm me down, then not sleep, and have a terrible down. Now, I'm trying to learn how to turn that negative into a positive edge for me, to ""armor myself against the world,"" because her drinking like this is one only of hundreds of BAD things I could face and certainly not the ONLY, so I'm learning through Al-Anon how to cope and thrive. 

I just had to learn how to trust Al-Anon and how to not do that. This summer when things were really bad, I'd grab it just so she wouldn't drink so much that she'd kill herself with it. Even that didn't work....Sure, she'd sleep it off, feel like crap for a day or two, tell me she was going to a meeting, sober up enough to buy more, then she'd come home and hide it even better. The last times she was actually hiding it in her trunk of her truck, with the spare tire. She'd head out and lie and drink in the garage when I left, or a construction site that was unmanned near the house. Or, when she got REALLY bad, she wouldn't care and it was just beside the bed, under the bed or mattress.

The better you get, the better they get. But also, the more careless they get, the less they care and the worse off they are. It's a catch-22. If they want it, they'll get it, and I found I either have to be ok that they will come around and insulate me and my son from it, OR leave her. When she got REALLY bad this summer, I scraped our Joint accounts and transferred any accessible money to MY account. I contacted an attorney. I took any house keys in the event I'd have to kick her out for good. I prepared myself to realize...""I don't have to do this anymore."" I don't HAVE to be with her. People fall in and out of Love for far less reasons and far more reasons...I don't need to be a slave to this any longer. It's nothing against her and I believe detachment and love and support come WHEN they are accepting of their disease and IN recovery, NOT when I'm sticking by her during the disease. If she slips up and wants support for me to be there and owns it...I'm in."
AlAnon,f7z4ya4,t3_dxzl3x,1574105377.0,"I can speak to my long situation and offer you what Al-Anon offers...hope. My many congrats to you. 

Speaking for myself, my wife has been 'in recovery' and received her first 30 day chip from AA, now 45 days. A year ago, however, she entered rehab for 30 days, left, relapsed within 7 days, did rehab for 60 days, left, relapsed within 30 days and had the summer from Hell. I've now been in Al-Anon and committed to a personal counselor for over a year. That's about the point in time I mark for my family of 3 (me, wife, and son) actually entering 'recovery.' Before that, before the fall of 2018, life was hell. We played at recovery, I dragged her to doctor appointments, two marriage counselors, various Intensive Outpatient programs (from weekend long to 14 days), attempted family interventions, professional interventions at a cost of $1500, and somewhere around 9 trips to the ER with 3 near-death alcohol related instances and two alcohol related auto accidents/incidents also almost resulting in death for her. The missed family events are too numerous to count, including prime holidays (xmas), our son's 1st b-day and her sister's engagement party. 

Rehab didn't help my wife. It was a stepping stone for her and me. I pleaded with hospitals to lead her to help, talk sense into her, family members would show up at our house wanting to help, but being unable to do so. That's when I took matters into my own hands. I take Al-anon like gospel in dealing with this, during our summer from hell I contacted various attorneys to 'wake up' to reality, I even spoke to our son's pediatrician, the town police, and my family. I have her on notice: no more. 

My story isn't someone else's and my wife is an awesome, amazing, beautiful, wonderful person, and alcoholism is an awful 'disease', that if our loved Q doesn't take seriously, they will die from, and us with them. Again, all my opinion and experience. Rehab was but a step on the path to my wife waking up to the horror that had become her life. Every relapse that happened, she believed her parents might be there, or maybe I wouldn't do anything drastic, or perhaps 'her false beliefs' that she was a good person, or would get custody of our son, or that 'police would back her' withered away. I would submit given what she's done, it's check mate. She recently lost her job, even though she did file FMLA multiple times and was actually doing ok.

What I can say about THIS for our loved one is...it isn't about THEM. It's about us. Our reactions. Our boundaries. Our wants. Our desires. Everything. It's us.

As ironic and sad as it is, my wife's sister (sister in law) is dealing with EXACTLY the same thing my wife is...alcoholism, almost like twins with the same disease. Four years ago, the same year my wife's alcoholism kicked off, we took my SIL to the ER for the same causes and back then, she also never 'entered' recovery. We found her passed, nearly unconscious during a visit to Boston at her new apartment when bringing our then newborn child to see 'aunty.' We couldn't find her for nearly an hour, even though we had an agreed-upon time. Finally, we bust open her bedroom door of her apartment and find her unresponsive and 'out of it.' Call the ambulance/911. Find a closet of empty bottles and the roommate (my wife's childhood friend), finally confesses that this has been going on for months, with her coveted and expensive wine collection 'disappearing.' As it happened, it was in the closet. Well...

Fast Forward three years to 2018, SIL is now engaged. One year later, 2019, engagement is put on hold by her Fiance...drinking, and as it turns out, it only kicked off and got bad when they got engaged. SIL enters rehab back in August in a last ditch effort to save her engagement and marriage. She does ok. Does the 30 program, pays $20,000 in payments, loses her job months ago, goes on Ue, and fiance 'waits' for her, in hopes she does ok and is sober. He does not however, do any personal work. No Al-anon, no counseling, nothing. His family is not supportive like mine is, and makes things harder for him and SIL to 'recover.' He's torn and the embarrassment of putting marriage/wedding on hold has eaten him alive. Just this last week, SIL has relapsed once again, and because he has nothing to lean on or go by, he makes matters worse (understandably). He's emotional, indecisive, controlling, mean, nice, all of the things we go through BEFORE recovery, because he isn't ready or capable of being there for HER.

In his mind, she MUST be and stay sober for her life, no relapses, not one year from now, not five years, or he's done. They're expected to move to Ohio for a new job where she'd stay at home, possibly in preparation for children and that is now on hold with her latest slip up. Again, he has no 'true north' by which to decide or understand expectations of anything of this.

Back in Nov 2018 when my wife entered rehab a kind Al-Anon friend approached me and told me ""not to get my hopes up on rehab"" and that ""this is a process"", that ""relapse is common"" with alcoholics, but that even though her daughter relapsed MANY times over, it was necessary to find sobriety. She had to keep digging a deeper bottom before she got up off of it. In this woman's case, her daughter did tons of things wrong, but finally got sober for a long period of time and committed to the 90 for 90. 

I'm glad I heard that frank talk to 'prepare' me for what came because the incidents AFTER rehab were WAY worse than life before it, especially because my wife was really trying to abstain and the more she abstained, the worse her events got, so much so that she nearly died from excess consumption of Vodka, and this past summer she ended up on a terrible binge since July, to the point I had her in the ER six times. And honestly, I didn't want to, but every time I saw her, she was like a dying dog, incapable of even getting to the bathroom, pissing herself, crapping herself, and just staying stuck. 

This august, I basically kicked her out. She fought like hell to get home, would use a neighbor, uber, or lie, all while she was stuck with that bad mind. Finally, Around early October 10/5 or so, I put the hammer down...she was out, or we leave and divorce. So far, she's sober about 40 days and she lived out a month at her parents. I'm hopeful that she maintains sobriety so we can remain as a family, but now I'm also not blind to all of this. 

I believe I was able to handle the events that happened because I took care of me FIRST. I believe my brother in law, SIL fiance, isn't ready and it won't work out. He isn't ""ready"" to handle the situations. That's ok, that's his path, but ""awareness"" of where he's add would lead to healing for all. I find it sad that they have to go down this path and I did recommend Al-Anon and counseling to him when it was evident his bride-to-be was struggling months ago with alcohol issues, dating back to this past Spring. 

I work in personal finance and deal with people and real life issues everyday, from spouses dying, to children, to cancer and other chronic/dread diseases and alcoholism is just one of many of those things would happen to us. My situation with my alcoholic wife is no different than a client at 67 dealing with this wife who has alzheimer's at 66 who is combative and needs help. We all have such issues in life or will face them. What woke me up was that ""I'm not unique or special"" and I need to develop an awareness, a ""calloused mind"" as David Goggins puts it, around these events. I'm a father, at 39, to an awesome 4.5 year old and what would I want him to emulate? How should he handle these things if faced with them at some point? How do I be a proper role model for our son? 

And so to me, Al-Anon was an awakening, a new way of life, I NEEDED this and God showed as much. I rarely around shows like ""Dark"" on Netflix which shows human events, time, suffering, choices, and so on and honestly APPRECIATE the moments now of sobriety my wife has and try to build on those moments because it's evident she doesn't like the drinking. The happy social hours she started with at 18 evolved into mass addiction in her 30's to cope with things she couldn't. She'll have to figure out 'why.' I can only do for me and I can't ""carpet the world,"" but I can put on slippers/socks. Meaning...I can address Al-Anon, counseling and be the best I can for ME, my son, my wife and other's, and believe ""hurt people hurt people."" Meaning...I truly believe no matter how bad someone is, they really don't want to hurt anyone, they just can't see the light of goodness (higher power) there in front of them. 

Good Luck and keeping coming back."
fantasyfootball,f7yhkv9,t1_f7y9pi9,1574095210.0,"Mine never has. I through Griffin in my DFS lineups but put Ebron in my Season Long; that was the difference between a win in my SL and cashing in my DFS for mere peanuts, b/c I whiffed everywhere else. 

Arians seems to be 'trying out' his roster before heading into his next season to figure out his needs. The talent on TB has been insane, the improved defense is a big boost, too, but watching this talent flounder and waste away around Winston is terrible. Every year Winston is projected as a TOP qb and he's like garbage time bortles all over the place, throwing up hail mary's to evans or getting bailed out by Godwin. Hopefully TB gets a legit QB, lets Jones run loose OR draft a competent RB and bolster both the oline and defensive backfield/cbs. Winston is just bad; he's lost games and not to outstanding defenses either. I've never seen such a veteran play like a rookie and being so invested in this offense with Evans, Jones and previously Howard, I watched in AWE at how you could determine the fate of the game right from Quarter 1 with Winston.

If Winston is doing well in the 1st Quarter, he's vibing and will probably at least put up good stats, but he'll ultimately lose. He's prolific b/c he has the right WRs, but makes horrible choices and when you need him to win or be smart, he isn't. He fumbles the ball away at the wrong time or takes a stack when you just can't. He chucks it deep in double coverage and he isn't super accurate. Early in the season Godwin soared b/c he just wasn't watching Evans get open or even bothering to chuck it Evans 1v1. Then, when Evans exploded, it was like ""duh..."" because Evans was always getting open or 1v1 and he could have been exploding early on. Instead I think Winston was just playing scared and mistake-less, so he kept feeding Godwin. Now reverse course, he's chucking to Evans and making mistakes or being ineffective. 

Simply put, they need a better QB, a younger one, any coming in this or next draft, and to move on at multiple positions. Get a 2nd for Howard or a 3rd; draft some safeties and CBs so they aren't always playing from behind, which is Winston's Achilles heel and move on."
AlAnon,f7lzwgy,t3_dwja6g,1573851409.0,"First off, I'm glad you posted. Keep posting and coming and reading. 

Second, if there's anything Al-Anon does say, that is comparable to an airplane going down (bad analogy but it works), ""you must put on YOUR airmask"" for you and your child, before you can even worry about your husband. That means different things to different people and you may read that in these forums or people posting to you or dming you. 

In my case, I was on the opposite side of your situation. My wife is now in recovery, but the first year of my son's birth she began drinking heavily about 3-4 months into my son's life. After she was done breast-feeding, she went to binge-drinking, hiding it, and it grew steadily right up until last month when I booted her out and she continued her binge...until her parents took her in. 

I can't say what I would do if I'm you, but I am glad you came here first! It took me 3+ years of my wife's growing alcohol abuse to get my butt to al-anon. I thought SHE would be fixed, esp. if I dragged her to enough counselors, doctors, or told her parents about what was going on. NOPE. I learned the hard way and that didn't begin until Al-Anon, personal counseling, personal choices and fending for my son and I, and being will to make the HARD choice to leave if need be, because in my case, if she didn't commit to get well and face it, she was committed to getting worse, which she did. 

The disease baffled me and without a support network of my family, friends, and even employer, I couldn't have done it. Diving into AL-Anon is what helped me, regardless of what my wife decides to do. As of now, she's back home, but it isn't easy either. The year of her pregnancy her hormones were well beyond normal for a pregnant woman, which likely was the lack of alcohol she was getting, but she wrote off her behavior and hid behind ""being pregnant,"" so I absorbed all of that. Then, when she gave birth and was hormonal, she wrote off her behavior and hid behind the fact she just gave birth. Not accepting what was going on dragged this on for nearly 3 years and has definitely made it hard to reconcile for me, even though we live together.

I was about to post separately, but I'll say it here, I'm afraid of her. I'm afraid of her relapsing. It's illogical, but the first 3 years of my sons life before I toughened up, I accepted it. And because I wasn't doing the right things for me (al-anon, counseling), people blamed me and that only made it worse. My wife is really attempting to get sober and stay sober now. She did rehab twice and still relapsed. It was at a great cost, too. Ultimately, it wasn't those things that got her to try sobriety, it was missing holidays, trying things that didn't work and attending AA meetings and counseling. She's still not well. Even last night she's claiming she's hormonal at 35 because of her menstrual cycle, but it was not 'healthy behavior.' 

Needless to say, I can't say what you should do, but definitely ""PUT your mask on FIRST"" For your and your new born life still to come."
AlAnon,f7ls2xh,t1_f7dllpz,1573847070.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. When I read of such comments about children to parents I think of my son to my wife, who's still struggling with her alcoholism and recovery. My wife (35) has been sober about 5-6 weeks, but her summer was spent between heavy relapses and some moments of sobriety. Her moments of binging were near fatal, often with a BAC of .45-.60 and forcing me to bring her to the ER or call an ambulance. 

I fear for my son having to someday not have his mother around or face the same things you've seemingly gone through and as a father witnessing this unfold, I'm sorry, and glad you're here. Keep coming back, because you never know who you are impacting (me). 

My dad is also an alcoholic, but ""doesn't have a problem because he is able to work and function and his doctor hasn't told him anything is wrong."" He goes through several of the cheap boxes of wine per week and always has a large mug/glass of wine in his, equivalent to several glasses of wine in one cup. It's gross and almost emasculating. What man drinks several glasses of pink wine a night, especially before he goes out to socialize and drink more(Franzia)? He quite literally drinks water and Franzia - that's it."
Divorce,f7ihwmc,t3_dwauuk,1573759809.0,"You can consult with an attorney sometimes for 'free', sometimes for the cost of 1 hour. I found it worth it, though I have not proceeded with divorce as of yet (alcoholism child involved, house, accounts, etc). I met with two attorneys; one charged nothing, the other charged his 'normal' fee of $400/hour for 1 hour. The one who charged me gave me TONS of value and paid-for, actionable advice on how to get my 'house' in order if I was to divorce. The last thing you want is being blind-sided that it is not being contested, then she does hire an attorney or uses family to assist in her defense and divorce. At least with a state licensed attorney, you'll have peace of mind knowing the in's and out's and interview 2-3 attorneys about your situation and who you are comfortable with. 

My first attorney pretty much told me I should divorce THAT day and told me I was screwed and gave me little understanding of 'why' or the process or potential costs. In fact, he low-balled the expected costs of divorce and did not evidently understand our state has AT FAULT provisions based on non-fulfillment of the marriage related to failure of the marriage for events such as trauma, anxiety, emotional or mental abuse, all of this related to her growing alcoholism. 

I paid my 2nd attorney in cash so there would be no trail or premeditation of an impending divorce. 

At 2 years, in my state, it is a short-term marriage and there'd be no alimony, very little if any split of assets, beyond 50/50, so it'd be smooth. HOWEVER, if you are apt to split ANY account, since you earned 2x her income, beyond the house, I'd advise seeing an attorney so you aren't split anything BUT the bank accounts and/or home. While you earn 2x her income and you probably won't owe alimony given the s/t nature of your marriage, splitting some assets may come into the fold and if, like my state, you can file as an AT FAULT event, then you may get more than 50/50 on joint assets (in my case it would be 60/50). 

If it's just the house and bank account, you're probably golden and it's easy to move on, but because of what's involved, I'm inclined to cover my bases and butt and make sure everything is ok. 

Again, at least an attorney just to fact check yourself and see a few."

I can speak from experience, not living a 'normal' life draws more attention and 'tension' to the drinker who feels at such events when they are being kid-gloved more awkward. My wife has had a horrible go of it the past four years, total binge drinking. I stopped in solidarity and she'd put down (2) litres of vodka behind my back. This wasn't because she wanted to be drunk like a 21 year old, but because of deeper issues. She has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, as any alcoholic does. It isn't until they choose and we impose boundaries that perhaps they realize this. 

We'd visit my parents and my mother, who once made light/weak mixed holiday drinks stopped doing that, so everyone was 'penalized' even guests who didn't know what was going on and it drew more attention to the matter. We'd visit my wife's parents and family would visit and again the 'non-alcoholic' drinks would appear (""we have water, seltzer, juice, fresca, soda, coffee"") and it would draw attention to their TWO alcoholic daughters, when the last thing they wanted was attention. If anything, they wanted to deal with the temptation while in a safe, comfortable environment to be tempted and resist and choose, not face the fear and awkwardness. 

People that don't get this haven't embraced or tried al-anon, or they'd have a healthier understanding. It boggles my mind that the ivory tower that is ""medicine and therapy"" rarely has practical experience with Al-Anon. It's a prescription, but of the mainstream providers I've met the past 3 years, none have actually been to a meeting, let alone understanding the material to any worthwhile, applicable degree. 

This was why I kind of go my own way, trust myself, because only people here 'may get it.' 

I just found I had to give myself permission to be happy, have joy and most importantly HAVE standards. I don't NEED to be with an alcoholic and if my wife isn't in recovery, why bother? I have a son, he's awesome and he's 4.5 years old. I'm not also her caretaker, so if she can't at least be a participant in the relationship, I'm all set. If she's making a concerted effort to be a participant and stay sober, then I'm willing to stay. But whether she's sober or not, or it's something, I can't control her; I never could. And I think that's the major point for me with al-anon...if someone cheated on me, I'm done. I'm not going to bemoan being cheated on and go off. That person made a choice, we're thru. IF that person opted to work through it, I could choose or not to be there for it. But at the end of the day, it's my choice and I can't control what that person does, only what I do."

fantasyfootball,f7bpzcg,t1_f7borfx,1573574973.0,"Ugh...

I'd prioritize Drake over Hill. If Freeman is out 2 weeks, he's certainly banged up and may continue to be banged up (see DJ). Like a cut, it only takes more nicks until he's perpetually out like DJ or Conner. With Drake, while the gamescript wasn't good, Kliff did say Drake was ""rolling"" so they gave him carries, even while DJ was supposedly 'available and/or healthy.' At least this season, Drake will be an RB2 or Flex IF the script is favorable and he'll get rushing/receiving work. 

With Hill, ATL pass defense is so bad, hill likely won't be in many favorable scripts, so he'll be relying on passing down work. I think we'll see more usage of him, but once Freeman comes back, it'll be a split backfield until he's injured again. 

This season has been such a headache for most positions, except QB and WR, I've had to relegate most backs as RB1, RB2 and FLEX/RB3. There aren't many reliable RB1 and RB2s, so it's a ""pick your poison"" kind of season with regards to that slot and honestly, leaving that 'headache' up to another team is often a GREAT way to set your opponent up. 

Early on this season I dropped Goff and it so happens the guy I played and beat started him...and received 5 measly points for Goff's start! I started Carr over Ryan, as his status was unknown and had limited practice, but locked in 5 points. Sometimes letting another team have that 'judgement' over who to start yields more rewards than playing ""keep away"" as there hasn't been much performance/production off Waivers to be afraid of.

In my case, the best performances I've found was actually dropping drake to start Rojo, which worked out this week. Also, Dropping Panthers D for Rams D (19 points). We'll see again if Rojo splits carries or is in the dog house for the fumble. 

Point is...there's no clear starters this year getting 20+ carries in GOOD game scripts to blow up on you."

fantasyfootball,f6w9th8,t1_f6uchfi,1573221032.0,"Scheme and gameplay matter, too. It came out after the fact, but Dissly has designed plays for him and in the past SEATTLE tried to use Jimmy Graham, alas that was largely a failure given his production in NO and the lofty expectations most had for JG. 

Detroit has yet to show any propensity to use a TE, though maybe they will once TJ gets his wheels under him and understands the TE position. However, a similar situation exist in TB, where you've got 2 top ranked WR - why would you throw it to anyone else on most plays? 

All the talent in the world won't matter if the QB and/or Coach do not want to target a TE. We saw it last night with Hunter Henry over Mike Williams. Henry got 7 targets, Williams 3. One could argue that Henry only got the targets he has bc Williams took away coverage, but the Chargers also have Allen and Ekelar to contend with, so this is also about what the QB will do on read options. 

Will Dissly, in addition to receiving the targets, was hella efficient. Between blocking % and also catch-rate, he caught most everything thrown his way and with the targets he did receive turned them into receptions. Unless schemed that way or game script, a TE won't get the production he needs for value. 

Dissly is also in year 2, DK in year 1. It may be a function of time and adjustment, that DK draws coverage Dissly won't and ultimately, Wilson and that offense needed a 3rd option. In Detroit, the 3rd option is often Amendola, b/c it's rare for a rookie TE to be that reliable, or any rookie. 

I'm likely writing the crutch arguments and narrative in hindsight of 'why' these TEs didn't pan out. I bit on the hype for OJ howard hard then went to TJ for salvation; it's been a streaming kind of year and TEs aren't returning adp value, not even close. Gesicki might not even be THE play. Certainly the deck is stacked against him and the ""crutch"" argument is, ""well the targets have to go somewhere, right?"" Not entirely, maybe the offense is just totally inept and never gets going and MIA really just tanks, so owning anything there is awful. I don't think that's Flores way, though, and Fitz will throw them through games. 

It we compare top TE situations, Waller, Hooper, much of it is a function of game-scrip, i.e. playing from behind or a high-scoring game, and also lack of options or present options not stepping up. Ridley isn't the #2 that Jones is on Detroit. Waller is the best option, esp. given Tyrell Williams injuries. You may have a Tryeek/Kelce situation, but if ever a Watkins stepped up, or Hardman consistently, then Kelce's production would be much more volatile or fall off, ala Ertz this year, with Goedert stepping up and Wentz Declining. 

The end result is, if a team has 2 top WR's we'd draft and we're targeting their TE for relevant fantasy production week in, week out, then we might as grab the QB too, because what we are saying is that QB can sustain some serious production and will have a top 10, if not top 5 year. This was the mistake I, and many made with Drafting Winston. Many thought Godwin would go off, that Evans would have his 'normal year,' and that Howard would take a step forward, too. Last year howard did in 10 games, 34 receptions, 565 yards and 6 TDs. Everyone would take that by now. But, the TE position has taken a step back there and most production has gone to Godwin and Evans, rather than expand the overall production out of TB. 

Stafford is having a great year, albeit with Golladay taking a step forward, Jones having an above board year, and Amendola coming on at times. Perhaps next year is Hock's year, if Amendola or Jones are gone (I don't know contract dates) or Golladay levels off. This year, Stafford is top 3 in terms of air yards and targets and Golladay is catching them. Odds are, we'll over bid on Golladay at ADP next year, and TJ will come on as a great short/intermediate route guy. 

Also, MIA has had no reliable TE production and now you vacated a major spot of production, Preston Williams who was their BEST, most reliable receiver. Parker has never proven to be a 1, but Preston is looking like if they get their act together."
AlAnon,f6tawfv,t3_dsvnf3,1573146372.0,"I can't speak to what you should do, only to what I might do if facing the same situation, and it was similar for me. In my case, it was last year at this time my wife was drunk at a child's birthday party at one of those ""bouncy-activity"" places for about 2 hours. I didn't have the eyes or mind to see what was actually going on and that was alcohol use/abuse/misuse. Instead, I'd written it off as tired, hung over, low iron levels, post-partum depression, and on and on. In my case, finding the endless amounts of vodka hidden over the successive months from 2018 until this summer helped me actually align my MIND with my LIFE, because I was displaced. 

I was living in alcoholism, reacting to it as a sick mind or ignorant or unknowing mind would, but not accepting of it. I didn't know \*what I should do\*. Once I got into Al-Anon and got into personal counseling, I knew better and have known better what I felt was best for me. 

I've come to learn, at least for my wife, there are no boundaries, there's just a line of a healthy life or not. There's progress or there isn't. There's recovery, or there isn't. I don't have to put myself in a position where it is an unhealthy life, marriage and/or childhood for my son. I matter. I have value. And if I am willing to give in a relationship, I should also be able to receive. I've supressed myself so long it's come bubbling out these past months. 

But from that kiddie event, my wife never got better. As it happens, I picked up on her being 'off', because that's what we called it and I knew she was drunk, but never knew it would be like a .45-.5 BAC and several bottles of vodka. I'd just thought she was drinking something to take an edge off or keep the hangover at baby. It took nearly a year for me to comprehend the severity of her drinking. So that day, in September 2018, I walked her out of the party and let her sleep in the truck. I left my son for all of two minutes with his friends as he played and the momentary absence set him off to crying. Ultimately, everything was ok. I got my wife home, I was personally not quite yet at al-anon, and she'd go on drinking. 

My wife attended REHAB for 30 days, left and relapsed, nearly dying, re-entered REHAB for 30 days with a 30 day IOP and likely relapsed on a 'managable' basis within 60 days or less. She herself hadn't yet accepted she had a problem; in her words, ""she thought she could handle it, that one drink wasn't a problem."" But also in her words, one drink didn't do anything, so she'd have more until ""it did something"", at which point she'd black out. 

That was this summer, when I had to take her the emergency room personally or via ambulance six times. Believe me, I didn't intend to that six times. Each of those times, I had kicked her out, left her at the hospital and told her she couldn't come home, to take an uber elsewhere and figure out if she wants to ever come home and recover. She was so mentally sick and I hadn't locked the house up completely nor found her secret stashes, that when I left for work and our son went to school, she'd check herself out of the hospital, come home, and pass out again. It wasn't until the sixth time I wised up, locked the house, took her keys and truly kicked her out. 

Heck, the first time was in the hospital for a whole week and she made several ""promises"" that that was the last time. She was in for so many days because she'd almost had a BAC of .6 and her vitals were awful. The medical staff said it was lucky she was saved and young, but if she keeps it, she'd die. That didn't stop her from still binging in August and September and repeating the same sins as last year. 

She's just hit 30 days sober with what I think is her first 30 day AA chip. To even get to this point though, I had to roll the dice and be willing to end it all and I am. I have to believe I'll just stop any day and face this straight up. When I didn't let her home in September 2019, she just left and went to a shabby motel 30 minutes away. She lied about entering an IOP and instead went on a week long binge at this motel. Her parents were furious at me. They initially said they'd ""take her in so long as she then found a new place to go, preferably REHAB,"" and offered her a loan to attend ""Recover Centers of America."" My wife declined. She felt if she was going to eventually be kicked out, she'd rather start out where she'd end up...the hotel. I only found her by doing a Wellness check, then a Missing Person's report. She had us horribly paniced for 24 hours, as her car was found miles away from where she was supposed to be staying at the hotel. The police kicked the room door in where she was staying at and found her drunk and passed out. They brought her to the ER and she stayed there for 3-4 days, whereupon she was released and went to live at her parents until now. 

That was 10/4/2019. Over the passing weeks, I've let her come and visit our son, be involved in his life and regain her footing. We did rehab at an extreme cost (upwards of $20,000 total) and all the other medical bills. We also did intensive weekend long IOPs and 2 week long IOPs. She's taken leaves of absence, attended AA programs, and now just recently gotten a SPONSOR. But, she also just lost her job, after all this, Tuesday of this week. She was carrying our medical insurance and was able to 'walk the tight rope' of keeping her job, all the while she was abusing/misusing alcohol. It caught up with her. My hope is she won't relapse, but I can't control that, only she can. 

I hit my bottom months ago and sought two attorneys to get my bearings under me. I even went as far as contacting our son's doctor to inform him of what's going on for any assistance or support, or even counseling for him. I sought the local police to inform them of our situation and anything I could or should do. One of the nights this past August/September was a time the local police showed up because I found my wife passed out in her truck in our garage. I left her there three hours to ""sleep off/work off"" the drinking and she was worse, not better, so I had to call 911 because she was unresponsive. 

What really got me to my bottom, at least now, is that, I'd never listen to music I once did an enjoy it. I hadn't seen friends or family I loved in a long, long time. I hadn't golfed at all this summer. Most things we planned were ruined or I was anxious with the spectre of what she might do or could do or what she'd do if I left her home alone (which was often get worse). I knew I was losing serenity and joy, all the while our son was getting older and the alcoholism was here right from the day he was around 3-4 months old and then it took off from there. The alcoholism was also there PRIOR to our wedding/marriage, but I didn't see it or want to;  I was sick also. I played into the fights, I drank socially perhaps too much, and when I wasn't a good person because of our fights, I'd accept blame and chase her, or pander, or apologize, doing everything she wanted. 

I'm grateful for my life for my son and the blessings we have shared. But I can't be deluded about the damage an alcoholic spouse and mother can have on me and him. Since I laid down the law, she's in recovery and notices it. She knows how bad she was, but it's taken a lot of stress to get there and I know at any moment she could go backwards. She HAS to want it. The six times I took my wife to the ER this year, and I was present for all of them, her BAC climbed, from .45 the first time to .60. The doctors and staff where aghast that she wasn't worse off and said she was likely coasting for a long, long time, that she never truly stopped because of how she was handling that much. Our general doctor even said she's likely been coasting because to jump back it with no absence would likely be deadly. 

My final boundary is our life and marriage. I've learned how to handle these sticky situations (I think). But i'm willing to pack it all up for our son, for my life and our future. I've dealt with her hardcore alcoholism for four years with no let up and 10's of thousands in medical bills. If anything, our last four years has been like one big binge. And while I really want believe my wife can beat it, and she's doing the right things to 'keep one day at a time,' I'm realist that the deck is stacked against her. She's 35, just lost her job, one month sober and facing a lot of regret for lost time, a miscarriage, a marriage in chaos, and her parents aging. The lucky part is she has a home, an education, no criminal record, her health and a family that has supported her the whole way. But, if this past year and then some, don't get through to her, there's nothing I can do."
fantasyfootball,f6sxznb,t1_f6slahu,1573141312.0,"As a former and recovering OJ Howard owner, who turned to THE Hock, I converted Gesickianism this week and beyond. 

1) This is year 2 of Mike's career and he's no longer encumbered by the Gase. 

2) Flores was in New England with Gronk there and may prefer throwing to Gesicki.

3) Preston Williams was coming as the #1. If it's going to be Devante Parker, he can't exactly handle double coverage and if he does, it's going to open work up for Gesick. 

4) The negative game-scripts MIA will be forced to play in makes him the best play here possible. The top 5 Tight Ends used across the NFL do so because they are likely the 1st or 2nd best athlete on the team and there's no other greater option. At best, Hock is 4th option here, behind Amendola, Jones and Golladay. Stafford has shown he prefers throwing it down the field and Golladay is benefiting and capable of making those catches; Hock hasn't proven he can bring them, which is why he's boom bust. Hock isn't getting many underneath routes at the moment, because the Air Yards in Detroit are second only Tampa Bay's. 

Ultimately, you don't want a TE on a team that has better WR options elsewhere. We've seen Ertz become less reliable because other options rose up OR he's the only option and is double-covered, thus the production flows to Goedert. Kelce may re-emerge with hill back to help and Mahomes returning. Waller is great, but he's also competing against Williams and now Zay Jones; not great competition as of yet. If AB is there, we probably wouldn't see such a breakout in Waller. With Austin Hooper, it's evident he's the 2nd most reliable target after Julio and is benefiting from negative game-scripts and Jones' double coverage. 

Unless you've got a Gronk or Kelce, or even Dissly, most coaches aren't designing plays to go through the Tight End, like we'd hope. Even Fant is boom/bust because he's getting deep throws and doing tons of blocking. He might be a phenom in 1-2 years if Drew Lock emerges, but his time isn't here yet. 

I'm sold on Gesick and knew people grabbing him LAST year thinking his combine profile would lend him to a mini-Gronk spot. Granted, much of what I spoke is Crutch arguments, but noticing the script helps too. This was the case with Darren Waller, as AB's absence gave him a chance. Hooper, same deal. Ridely and Sanu never stepped up reliably as they could and the ATL defense is often playing from behind. It was only LAST game Preston was injured and Gesicki blew up. Preston had the most targets on the Dolphins, then Parker, then Gesicki."
fantasyfootball,f6pqy4p,t3_dsgc5t,1573062355.0,"Thank you for this. SUPER tempted to drop my Panthers D and stream the season out. I could grab RAMS d or Chiefs D at this point. 

I have Matt Ryan, and he now faces CAROLINA D twice, so I don't exactly want to 'root against' either, unless I play Carr over Ryan. Panthers schedule now faces 'better' QBs...RyanX2, Saints w/Brees, Seahawks during my potential Championship game!, Rogers this week and the only tasty match-up would be Washington, week 13.

About 1/2 in my league of 12 are now streaming weekly. 

Thoughts?

Switch to streaming or keep a top-ranked defense because panthers D will over come the game-script forecast vs. good QBs?"
fantasyfootball,f6jlrah,t3_drhmb1,1572896640.0,"Henry's issue is play-calling, perhaps his aggressiveness, O-line, and respectable QB so he isn't facing 8 man stacked boxes. 

I watch many of the Titan games and/or have Redzone on and Henry gets the bulk of the carries, which you want in an RB2, is incredibly powerful and efficient IF he gets a passing down target, and is nearly impossible to bring down. He's often in negative game scripts. Even yesterday, I was staring at goose-egg, regreting starting him against MY Carolina defense also in-play, with Ronald Jones on the bench, when he gets the Goal-line work AND they throw a swing pass to him that goes for 36 yards! That's the kind of unexpected damage he does in the offense. A smarter coaching staff might use him better and differently. 

Week 1 he had 2 TDS, ripping off a 75 yard bomb. He's quite literally the Juggernaut, as it appears he takes more time to 'get up to speed,' but he's nearly impossible to bring down. The dude runs a 4.5 40 at 250 lbs! He's a line-backer with RB speed and only 25 years old. The Titans ought to go get Nick Foles or maybe even Winston in Free Agency; any QB that might put the Safeties back and give Henry more room to run puts him easily in top 10 consideration or better. 

I've been happy with him as an RB2, knowing he could give RB1 stats in the right game-script. And, he has had less than 13 carries once, which was this past week, and then they gave him more carries in the 2nd half, plus passing game work. That's the only hitch, how TD dependent he is, and he's had Tds in 6 out of 9 games, with 2 more tds coming from passing, so multi-td games."
SingleDads,f6h3cp2,t3_dr0p64,1572836067.0,"Not familiar with Cali state law and not an attorney, but I have contacted several attorneys for my situation and my understanding is that isn't where you were married, but where you reside \*when\* you divorce. Divorce is also a process; how things are today is not how they will be in a few years. 

1. Consult with an attorney ASAP so you know what you should do. Anything anyone speaks to that isn't from Texas, an attorney and has experience is delaying time for your help and recovery. 
2. Seek professional help, therapy, counseling, etc. Don't lock this down, esp for the sake of your kids and you. Your long-term well-being and the health of your children rely on this part! Also, it may benefit your custody and alimony situation if you are the responsible parent that is taking care of all measures. 
3. Document everything. Find out if cameras are legal in your state. Do not write down anything that can be held against you. Listen to your attorney!

In my situation, my wife has been a progressive alcoholic with possible mental health/behavioral issues and I finally sought Legal advice this fall from two different attorneys. We were married in one state, but the state we live in now and would divorce in ultimately governs what happens. This benefits you, from what I can tell. Also, some states have changed their alimony figure, so at 10 years you may be a medium term marriage, reducing any alimony due. Custody typically leans 50/50 unless there are mitigating factors where one parent is currently incapable of providing care (drugs, abuse, alcohol, etc). 

In my case, I could file 'AT FAULT,' with regards to my wife due to her alcoholism that ""she is incapable of living up to her role as a wife,"" thus it's at fault and I'd get 60% of assets and reduced alimony. Presently, she is 'in recovery' and I haven't filed, but if I did while she was is not recovering, she would not have any sense of custody, except supervised, by the courts or designated family members. 

I can't imagine what you're going through in this case, though I've felt similarly and often second-guess myself as to when I'd divorce. I won't bore you with the details, but it's been far worse than just her drinking, passing out, or sleeping in bed for days and after 4 years I've tired of being her wet nurse and whipping post, to the point this last time IS THE LAST time. 

Good luck. I implore you to seek professional help, especially because it may take time to find one you feel comfortable with and trust, as that was the case for me. I met with one attorney that was free and pretty much motioned me to file that day to cover my butt and the second attorney I met with 2-3 weeks ago, paid $400 for 1 hour and honestly felt A LOT better about meeting with him. He was frank about the process, told me realistic numbers and gave me greater feedback on the pros/cons and possible outcomes. He also had tips and 30 years of experience in doing this, as well as a team to work with. I've since retained his office and happily paid him. Had I gone with the first attorney, my mind would be swimming."
wow,f62h1ub,t1_f61tglt,1572659444.0,"Might have been ret-conned as of now, as all 3 chronicles did likewise. However, theories floating about include...

\- Aeonar the ""life binder"" bound Azeroth to a prison of it's own creation. While KJ made the Helm, we don't know the source of his power or if perhaps he was deceived to make it and further imprisoning Azeroth and it's denizens. Watch Pyromancer's last 12 months or so of videos but no one has pieced together more of what's occuring than he has. Even during the initial panel of ""What's next"", they zoomed in on him quite frequently. 

\- The Helm being forged at some point was possibly a prison for Azeroth long ago, forged before Arthas took it up, so it's been around awhile, just not since time began. The helm breaking was on purpose and maybe not all planets. The premise of the Shadowlands is going to be that ""the hereafter"" is broken, hence why Sylvanas is growing stronger, because she sided with ""true death"". Bolvar was likely played or playing false; he wasn't just jailing the scourge (damned) he was jailing Azeroth's living, too. With the perpetual ability to rez the undead, he'd always have an army to keep us in check. If anything KJ, the deceiver, created the helm with the power of 'locking' Azeroth (Titan of Creation) down, so that Aeonar ""the Life Binder"" (think on BINDING LIFE), an eternal prison of HER own making. 

Recall the Thousand years of War with Alleria, when she has the horrid dreams of Argus' existence? Yes, the 'GOD/Titan of Death' was trapped, too, by the remaining Pantheon. Sargeras side with Argus, hence the sword being plunged INTO Azeroth, thus the blood. The fight with Argus also had us DIE then be rezzed; is there anything worse than constant resurrection? No. Think of Dr. Stranger when he's locked into a never-ending cycle of undeath. It's more torture than real death. 

It's more evident than ever that the flow of anima is being stopped by Aman'Thula and Aeonar who are ""the Void Lords"" (credit to Pyromancer) who are creating or have created the VOID when Life overgrows its bounds. Recall Warlords of Draenor and the EVERGROWTH dungeon? Unchecked life is nearly a cancer. 

The entity in the helm is a jailer of life and death and the helm likely locked Azeroth further in it's prison. We aren't just breaking and fixing the hereafter, we're also 'freeing' Azeroth slowly. More than anything, Sylvanas probably saw nothing in the hereafter when she plunged to her death atop ICC because the hereafter is/was broken! There should always be something to see for any entity; the evidence was there tonight on the panel alone that even Arthas'/DK power comes from a place in The ShadowLands, but we're to discover what's going on in the Maw later on, which is probably more to what's been usurped. Again, if the Shadowlands PREDATES much of the Titans...maybe that's where Elune hales from?"
wow,f625fdu,t1_f61bzeo,1572653654.0,"This was poor reasoning on the part of Blizz because without a lich king, which are locked up in Northrend, they also won't be rezzed forever either. The lich king also reanimated his army and relied on living to continue reanimating the dead, ad infinatum. I think that statement was more posturing as to why Bolvar took the helm until now. AND...we also don't know what that spirit actually represented. If we buy that ""Azeroth"" is a prison, then King Terenas could have been a manifestation meant to 'lock' the denizens of Azeroth in the cycle of undeath. 

Argus - Titan/God of Death/Dead / New Avatar of dead on Azeroth is Sylvanas, hence her insane power level to death LK.

Calia - Avatar of Aeonar / ""Life Binder""

Magni - Avatar of Azeroth / Titan of Creation

Sylvanas went from Legion to BFA, now locating Argus who was in the Sword of Sargeras (hence the eye) and it was the fusion of Blood between Azeroth/Argus that brought us here. I'm firmly in Pyromancer's camp (have the chronicles and many of his videos) that Sylvanas has realized, through her many deaths, that the ""other side"" was corrupted by Aeonar the ""Life Binder,"" and this was why Sylvanas had her anger and no compunction about killing people, because she'd eventually shatter the veil between them ""And save them."" 

We are all damned if there was ""no other side"" to actually go to. I wouldn't be shocked if Pyro's work is much along the lines of what Blizz is doing now because it's far more interesting than the basic trope of Good vs. Evil. I think we'll realize that nothing we did on Azeroth mattered, because we were in effect trapped endlessly, like Looper or Dark, by the Bad Titans, Aeonar and Aman'thul. Their ""ordering"" of the universe took a twisted, prideful turn, whereby they locked Azeroth and Argus in their own 'prisons'. 

We know this from Alleria's visions and communion with Argus during the comicbook viewing prior to the release of Argus, thousand years of war. We also know ""life unchecked"" is also imbalanced, which might be where the Old Gods are. As far as Azeroth goes, she's been locked in a sleeping slumber by Aeonar/Aman'thul (maybe Elune?) the manifestation of Old Gods was Azeroth's own creation, not void shot from another dimension.

The helm itself might have been ruse by Aeonar in another form, as it's unlikely that Sargeras would actually create that to stop the natural course of life. Granted, it was Kil'Jaeden and maybe he was played false by another Titan, but it isn't Sargeras' belief to 're order the world. He sought disorder and to wipe it clean. He believed in death and cycles and saw their re-ordering to be unnatural as it was."
fantasyfootball,f60m0qa,t3_dq3g8i,1572620591.0,"Yes, and I try to learn lessons from about such performances and roster building for future decisions. 

For example, most projections, podcasts, and websites come to the same conclusions about fantasy football rankings. We think we ""know"" how the game will go based on projections and past performances. However, if we know anything about FF, it's that most of it never goes as planned (except the patriots defense). 

I think contextually I like to listen to podcasts, gurus and furus, and review websites to understand if a certain QB or RB performance is legit, or random chance happening. Chris Harris and his youtube/podcast shows are a good example of this. Conversely, there's several top podcasters/experts that give you the cliche, normal outlooks that simple ESPN projections in your league will give you. 

We're all searching for meaning in chaos and random sample sizes. Flip side of that question, if you embraced a chaotic building to your lineups would you feel better about the outcome if it was successful? Would you feel worse if the chaotic building didn't work?

For example, my opponent started Tevin Coleman over Kenyan Drake. A truly  'rational' decision, given \*past performance.\* However, Coleman also performed with limited touches and high efficiency, so it was possible regression would occur as he splits carries with the tought Breida, and he did. Also, AZ is easily beaten through the Air, unlike Carolina which is evidently easily beaten on the ground. My opponent also started Dak, instead of Jimmy G, a perfectly rational response. However, Jimmy G was due for TD regression and AZ is pretty bad at defending the pass, given SF's bevy of weapons, on top of injured Rbs, so the points would have to come from the air, most likely. 

I leave my 'locks' in...Henry, Barkley, Evans, Golladay and if I don't have an elite position, i.e. QB or TE, or Defense, then I stream and don't beat myself up. If you don't have elite performers who will regress back to their projected mean for some reason, then I agree a roster overhaul is in order, via trade or something else. Teams sitting on Gurley, for example, should trade him to a team with Henderson and perhaps get a WR1 or TE1 with more production at a limited spot. I don't beat myself up when Evans doesn't perform, because he will unless he's having a bad year or injured, similar to Adams or Mahomes. 

Right now I'm wagering on my flex spot, but that's it. I can think through the possibilities, but that's it. If my core is good, then I'm fine with whatever the outcome is, regardless of ESPN's projections. I also have read much of what Taleb and Duke have spoken about and try to embrace that chaos, outliers and fat tails into my roster construction. If I have a good floor/ceiling going, then maybe I try to have fun (that's the whole point!) and put in a guy I just like. 

As an example, last week I started Mason Rudolph, since Ryan was out/injured. I could have gotten Carr and won by a mile, but I only won by 1 pt! Thank God! Had I started Miles Sanders, something no one is doing unless absolutely necessary, I'd have won handily, because Henry was awful and Edmonds went down. I'd definitely have been upset, because Sanders has that potential game by game. I thought with Edmonds his guaranteed touches would yield a respectable floor, however, if my opponent had a big game, I had no major Upside, because Edmonds' match-up wasn't good. Whereas Sanders has that 'chaos' element to his game; he can give you 7 pts or 20 pts and you have to decide if that's what you want in your flex spot. I 'bet' on Mason Rudolph being great against the Dolphins, which he wasn't and I'm lucky he got the 250 yards and 2tds I needed to win. Had he not, I'd have lost. So I'm rethinking my roster construction going into this week and moving forward, and also reviewing what my opponent has going on."
fantasyfootball,f60lbur,t1_f60fbnp,1572620110.0,"I agreed with you, because the 'normal' logic of FF lends to 'chaos' (please everyone, go read Nassim Taleb or Annie Duke's ""thinking in bets."") This is how DFS lineups blow up, with Mike Evans putting up 30-40 per any given week, or Godwin being a PPR monster, or expected blowout games not following 'script.' The idea that an unproven Mark Walton would outperform Kenyan Drake, literally the only Back playing that game, AT HOME, is in my opinion, bad logic. 

Walton is playing the Jets, a team that could go up big and just hope Fitz throws int after int. We haven't seen a 25 carry walton, and there's a reason he was the 3rd rb...he was getting the reps because they were trading Drake, not b/c he was better. And, it's also possible Walton had more effective running plays or his runs were more effective because when they didn't think they'd actually run him, unlike Drake who's a proven runner AND receiver, so in a Patriots sort of way, shutting down Drake when he's on the field is the plan, whereas shutting down Walton who isn't as big a threat wasn't the priority or goal. 

SF is a good defense, but they also haven't faced a ""Murders Row"" of teams/qbs either, similar to the Patriots. With the exception of the Rams, it's bad Qbs or back-up Qbs...and Arizona isn't bad. 

Edmonds wasn't ineffective, he was injured, so we'll never know what his performance might have been the prior week. Suffice it to say, backs in this system are Good."

Things I learned in my state regarding a similar situation.

1) Individual accounts across the board. Credit cards. Bank Accounts. All of what you need. Make it happen. Anything your names are on jointly would be up for grabs in any type of legal battle, either divorce or law suit.

2) Up your home owner's and/or umbrella insurance. It costs peanuts and will ultimately protect you (and him) in the long-run. Umbrella policies may cover 1-2m, and most homeowners with any assets should have them anyways, not just a standard home owner's policy. 

3) If you know or 'enable', depending on the severity of such an accident, you would also be likely held accountable to some degree. Certainly if it happened and you knew and could have done something and didn't, then in a lawsuit any assets would be reachable, possibly. Again, talk to an attorney locally, but you can't get off scott-free if you knew of a specific event occurring. 

I do believe alcoholics need to face their consequences and have spoken to my local law enforcement regarding my wife at various times and it's true that they can't do anything until they are caught. However, I couldn't live with myself if I knew my wife was driving drunk (which she's done) and could have killed someone, or perhaps us. We live on a quiet, long, curvy street and families often walk along the side (no sidewalks) and cars will bomb around the corners. It'd be very easy for a text-and-driver or drunk driver to hit someone on a curve. I'm not sacrificing someone else's life so that the alcoholic in my life ""might hit bottom and find sobriety.""

The Al-Anon meeting I used to attend more regularly had most people stating they would NOT call the police if someone drove drunk and it was known, stating ""we can't control it"" and ""alcoholics must face the consequences of their actions."" Reading the newspaper that some alcoholic hit and killed someone...no, just no. I'd report it the minute they left and hope that sufficed. IMO, if my wife pulled out or I knew she was in some area and she shouldn't be, I would. I may not STOP her from getting in the car, but the minute she does something illegal, I'm calling the police."
AlAnon,f5weab4,t3_dpi80e,1572521872.0,"I've found I can't control it at home either. When I did that, because of her addiction/disease, she'd hide it, put in the trunk of her truck and claim to be attending a meeting, then come home and pass out, try to 'ween' off, use nips or small pint bottles. No matter the way, they get more clever. 

The 'boundaries' and control I have is...

\- Do I want to live with this version of this person? They have to choose who they are with me. 

I had my wife leave. And I told her if she returned to her ways when she came home, that's it for me. I'd have the same hard rule for a smoker, as I'm not a smoker and do not wish to be with a smoker. While alcoholism is labeled as a disease, if our Q is not treating it as such and actually actively seeking treatment and recovery, boundaries become control, imo. A boundary, if I am married to my wife and it is her home, is stating this is what I want in my healthy life not, ""you will or won't do X here."" 

The control, the boundary, the pressure, the draw, has to be more enticing to be with us, than the alcohol. I don't have a plan for what my needs for HER recovery and that's HER celebration if/when she does. So far it's been 4 weeks of sobriety, meetings, a therapist, counselor and AA for her. But...she's been the ER 9x before this moment, rehab twice, and claimed to attend meetings. I only told her that her son and I (he's 4.5 years old) were done. I'm walking, I love her, but I'm done. 

I'd never bought her alcohol once I committed to recovery and supporting her. My wife's de facto sponsor (and aunt who gives guidance, advice and support who's been sober 6 years) said ""the worst thing an alcoholic can do is have one drink and have nothing happen"" because they think they don't have a problem or they have it under control. 

As my wife has come to accept her disease, while not understanding the depth or origin, she told me she'd ""have something to drink to feel the buzz, nothing would happen, so she'd have more, then black out."" That's most alcoholics. They seek the feeling a buzz gives them, most of 'em, but because the tolerance is ever-increasing, it eventually never comes. The addiction builds to such a level that they need to drink more, without the attendant feeling. 

The last time my wife wanted ""one more drink"", i denied it like you. We were on a date and our son was away for two trips. She wanted me to partake in the drinking, too. ""Just one,"" she said, ""to feel normal."" It ruined the date. Two days later, she was blackout drunk and I had to bring her the ER, as she was unresponsive. My wife's drink of choice was Vodka, hidden anywhere, followed-up with blackout drunk, sometimes pissing herself in our bed. She'd go 0 to 90 in a matter of hours. When she decided against recovery and for continuing her drinking, I brought her the hospital and didn't let her come home. That was almost 60 days ago. She's been at her parents for going on 40. Before that, I told her to ""go to her parents, find a rehab place, family or friend to live, but she couldn't be home or I was leaving with our son and selling the house and ending the marriage."" She decided to go to a hotel, where she continued her binge, while lying about attending an IOP and AA. 

The only reason she ended up at her parents is because after 10 days, her parents caved. They are not active in Al-Anon, read nothing about it and feel there should be medical treatment available. However, they felt ""their bottom"" when after 10 days they hadn't heard from her and knew she wasn't home. I filed a Wellness check and Missing Person's report to 'find her' passed out drunk in a hotel room. The police kicked her hotel door in, carted her to the ER again (the 9th time) and nursed her back to health. She stayed in the hospital for 3 more days. This summer she's been in the hospital for at least two weeks total time just for drinking. When she was released, her parents relented and took her home, giving her a safe place to live, collect herself and approach recovery in \*her\* way. 

See, her parents, after 4 years of struggling with her alcoholism, and well struggle with what to do, I think, felt ""someone else could cure it."" They always wanted ""someone"" else to do the work, treatment and care for her, to get through to her, never realizing ""yale or Jail,"" I don't care how you get sober, but you can. It's THEIR choice, and it has always been. My 'serenity' has come because I can choose to leave and I'm no longer afraid to. I have boundaries and standards. I've come to the realization that it isn't a boundary to tell my wife what ""she can and cannot do,"" but I have said I will not live and support an alcoholic house and she wouldn't either, so I am prepared to leave. In the past, I did, because I'd try to control, locate, find, yell, scream, convince, argue, legislate, pander, and on, and on, and on, about her drinking, and need to get well. I had her go and face her drinking on her, giving her space to realize what she stands to lose."
Marriage,f5v46yc,t3_dp9o97,1572483410.0,"> I asked her about it and she said she didn't know that kind of counseling was a thing, and she doesn't think we need to go through it either.

Married 5 years. Together 14 years. Married in a church, before a priest, with all of our friends and family in attendance. We have one son, 4.5 years old. For the last 4 years, my wife has battled alcoholism. Hard. 

Your statement about ""she doesn't think we need it"" is a huge red flag to this 39 year old man. Someone else posted somewhere that if a couple isn't willing to spend even a few hundred dollars and some time on PRE-marital counseling, why get married? If you couldn't have the wedding and the 'day' (and honeymoon) would you?

IMO, the desire, willingness and openness to 'change,' better oneself, be frank, be vulnerable, learn new ways of thinking (a growth mindset) are immensely important in your today, tomorrow and future together. You are not a static couple; you are ever-changing and your ability to face things together is what's going to keep it healthy. 

We did pre-marital counseling and what it did for me as a husband (though I didn't realize it at the time) was that my wife wasn't willing to get 'deep.' We did the questionnaire, counseling and met with our priest and much of it, in hindsight, was fudged because my wife 'heard' that if the questionnaire was answered in a certain way the priest would discourage a couple from getting married and she didn't want to upset her dad. Silly me. I learned the hard way and have been in marriage counseling, Al-Anon (wife in AA) and regularly attending church and a personal counselor once a week. 

On the flip side, I couldn't be more grateful and thankful for my life. My wife is an amazing woman with a horrible disease, one we didn't face up front. Other people may have infertility issues, as my cousin and close friend did, that will reek havoc on a relationship/marriage. Some may have early cancer issues to deal with in their 30's. 

I guess what I'm saying is, it's about ""making you aware of the things you may not even know exist,"" and the most horrible thing a couple can do when embarking on a life long journey is to think ""we've got it figured out"" or ""we're all set."" There's a reason divorce rates are over 50-60% and many couples cheat; ""it's not what you don't know"", it's ""what you do know that ain't true"" but you believe to be true. 

I'm probably coming off harsh, but I'm very blessed with where I am in life. I LOVE my son and if for no other reason than his existence, this is why we married. However, I have a wife that not only wants to fight against a horrible disease, but wants to be married. We've been to the bottom and may go back there, but when people say ""ride or die,"" I can say such a thing with confidence. I've cleaned her up to get her to the hospital. I've taken up the mantle of being the sole caregiver and provider for the family on countless occasions, pushing my own boundaries as a father in ways my father never did. I've been there to be her rock and the rock of even her parents when she's nearly died three times now and saved her life more times than I care to remember. Alcoholism is a horrible addiction and disease and it's also more pervasive than anyone can imagine.

But also, through what I do for work (financial planning) I encounter people who face hard life events. Just today I met with a couple we were planning on obtaining Life Insurance for his retirement plan. As it terms out, at age 59, after 40 years of work and 20 years of marriage, he failed the medical in June. The underwriters requested that he see his GP and have follow-up exams. This past week he was diagnosed with cancer of the kidney, something we ONLY would have caught by seeking life insurance, because evidence was in his urine and general medical exams for men do not look at urine. This exam possibly saved his life! His wife was actually thanking us and when we started the process 4 months ago we told them ""the exam is no charge, it's beneficial to your planning to see if it's something worthwhile to have."" These challenging events encounter ALL of us and we can view them how we choose. 

So if I'm you, this is one set in a lifelong journey, but a critical one, one I didn't realize the value of at the time, because you aren't caring so much about what is specifically said or comes of it, but how you two HANDLE this situation. What's her reaction to this? How serious does she take it? What is your interpersonal experience like with it?

Good luck."

wow,f5o1lsj,t3_doddoz,1572308021.0,"My hope with this is more along the lines with what Pyromancer on YOUTUBE has been discussing for almost a year. Go check him out if you are not familiar with his theories. Perhaps some are you disagree, and some aren't and should have alternate perspectives. Some of his theories...

\- N'Zoth isn't an old god per say.

\- The Void Lords are or could be Eronar & Aman'thul.  ""Life unchecked"" becomes what an Old might be."" 

\- Argus was within Sargeras' blade and is now part of Azeroth. Argus was the Titan of death and trapped before he was awoken by the Early pantheon Titans and Azeroth is the titan of Creation and almost 'trapped' before her power emerged. The 'dream' is that Azeroth was kept dormant or asleep so that all of creation was not 'in balance;' the God of death was controlled and the power of creation usurped, so all that remained 'in order' would be life, and unchecked life. Evidence we have of this would be dungeons in WoD and the Primals that grew to epic proportions. 

Along those lines, I'm hopeful that the Lich King isn't 'bad' but has actually found the Shadowlands were usurped instead by the Void creeping in. This is what Sylvanas actually saw when she died, instead of 'the ever-after,' and that's why she came back. During his time atop the Frozen Throne, TLK has also seen this and the power overwhelms. Through events in BFA, the realization that death doesn't exist or is entropic, a living hell, he's taken up the opposite of the mantle, hence him dawning the armor we see. TLK is neither good nor bad, and has 'temporarily' joined the fight to put order back to 'death,' lest he lose his powers and control of the 'undead.' 

This remains me of one of the Hellraiser movies, where Pinhead fights back against a greater evil, on temporarily, to set things right. Pinhead was actually in competition, but only those souls desirous of him also (those who would open the box). Unfortunately, in one of the movies, someone actually triggers the box in the opposite direction and releases another more powerful being, even one that Pinhead could not contend with. He was a mere distraction while the 'true hero' set things right. Pinhead was never defeated permanently, but did lose his power. 

Along those lines, seeing TLK being more than a boss would be awesome and having him introduce as chaotic neutral might allow us to bring in Taelia in without the typical direction we might see. Also, having the Shadowlands usurped or corrupted, would explain Odin, Hellya, and perhaps so much of what Sylvanas is actually doing, but never spoke about. This would explain why she didn't go directly there; why would any undead then want to die if the process sent them to 'nowhere'? It'd make more sense that there here-after didn't exist because other forces moved in, i.e. the Void, which has no taken control of it. 

We could see the present incarnation of Bolvar defeated, with Sylvanas take the mantle later on, as Bolvar's body is defeated in battle vs some void entity, or perhaps an empowered Hellya, Odin, etc. I'm not sure we want Calia Menethil anywhere near the forsaken, because if you buy into Pyro's statements on this, Calia is more a 'speaker' for Eonar the Voidlord, then any independent, resurrected being. 

I apologize if I've gone some of this wrong. I'm not as versed as other's on the topics, but have the Chronicle volumes, as well as many podcast hours invested, and Pyro videos."
fantasyfootball,f5m294v,t3_doa4sr,1572285754.0,"RB3 or Flex play, at best. I do think he's a good lock, but his upside is limited, while is down side is limited, too, to 0. If you're desperate or it's a bye week fill-in great. But game scripts won't be great there, the line is awful and the forward schedule for both Drake and Walton is still bad. 

At this point in the season though what you need is guaranteed production, esp. in fall/winter when outdoor games benefit RBs."
fantasyfootball,f5m1lrl,t1_f5li34v,1572285634.0,"Aaron Jones isn't a 'workhouse' but he's incredibly efficient. Sanders just has to improve on his blocking and inside runs, which he did yesterday taking one to the house, and he could at least be in a great role. You say it as if he is Carlos Hyde, when he isn't. The production Sanders has offered in limited action is Nick Chubb-like, except more on the pass-catching side.

\*If\* he does do better on inside runs, he'll get more reps and be an RB2/flex next year. Certainly Jordan Howard isn't going away this year and he's still quite young 24/25. Rational coaching would suggest, much like the Patriots and Chiefs, they'd have split time. Unless an RB is picked in Round 1, ala Sony, Barkley, Monty, Jacobs, I wouldn't put much stock in a player being an auto-rb1 out the gate, perhaps if ever. Even Kamara split time, until Ingram left, and they've brought back Murray, likely leading to more split time to 'preserve' him for the post-season. 

If the Giants ever get someone to back-up Barkley, I'm sure he'd lose touches, too, to prolong his career, and if Dallas goes deep, then we'll get a lot more Pollard. It's the way of the world now. I bit into Sanders big time on the love his play by Matt Waldman and Evan Silva, but not enough of my own DD. We don't live in the pre 2009 world where RBS get all the carries and a drafted rookie normally gets a full workload year one. It's the era of RBBC and successful split backfields like GB, previously NO, New England, etc, just make this all the more true. 

If the Cook owned isn't backing up his shares with Mattison, he's in for a world of hurt. The more dominant that team is, the more likely Cook loses carries as we enter FF playoffs and same with Zeke. Once everything is locked up, it's shut down time, most likely (see Gurley)."
fantasyfootball,f5l4sta,t1_f5kxxnu,1572274023.0,"Whatever the outcome is, this isn't a spot.

1) AZ's remaining schedule is brutal for RBs, on top of having a BYE week.

2) Chase Edmonds isn't built to be a lead back; he's 5'9"", 210.  Drake and DJ are 6'1"" 215+ and can take the rock and pounding. 

3) AZ is heading for a top 10 draft pick to bolster this team, desperately in need of more healthy, young weapons for Murray, an O-line and defense for the young QB. 

Not sure why more teams aren't embracing the 'tank' like MIAMI is, because what's the point of embracing season, if not career, ending injuries? There's still 8 games left and while they're getting paid, I see a team like Miami and even if you get a starter there, it's worth less than someone sharing time on another team, because if MIA looks to be capable of winning, they'll pull the breaks and lose for those top picks. We saw it with Drake dropping the 2pt conversion. 

I'm dropping Chase to grab Guice, because if he's back week 11, then he has 5 weeks to play, and likely during some weak teams/schedules, with the injured Thompson, aging AP, and likely at least split time or better. He's been posting on Twitter a lot and starting by then is getting a head start on next year. Hopefully he can overcome the dysfunction that is Washington, though."

After a series of blunders and injuries early in the season, my team is basically 'season-long, weekly DFS' mode. Barkley went down early and hasn't performed as the lead dog I needed, drafting OJ Howard, and touchdown-dependent Henry are making it tough. I have no weekly reliable performer, like the Cook, Kupp, CMC, Watson, etc owners. 

Hoping as we head into Waivers to lock down Cam on his way back (:crosses fingers:) or Herndon. Mistakes I've made are not going with my 'gut' ( was going to play Jonnu Smith this week, but started TJ Hock instead), not grabbing McLaurin early on or the SF defense. Team Defense is hard, but it seems that if you draft a TOP 5 edge rusher each year, it's probably a good idea to grab that defense, too. Last year was Bears, this year Patriots and SF. Next year, who ever gets Chase Young?"

Edmonds got me 2, plus he's injured. I don't think Sanders loses his carries, as Howard is doing well with what he does and it looks to be a 1/2 punch, I only wish Sanders was like Chubb last year and that he'd get the full work load, with Howard spelling him.

AlAnon,f5g0ff0,t3_dnrpyk,1572188484.0,"I don't know the specifics, but I've been married to my wife for 5 years, she's been on a hardcore 'binge' about 3 months into our son being born, so for the past 4.5 years, it's been a progressive, 'living hell.' She'll have moments of sobriety, for weeks or two, or three, but then she'll just binge-out on us while I'm at work, or thinking she's getting well, and we 'lose' her for a weekend or a week. 

In my wife's case, I didn't understand her drinking until about 3-4 months after our son was born and she stopped/gave up breast-feeding. Before that, there were red flags regarding her drinking, such as hidden nips and bottles her dad and I found, only weeks before the wedding. With my wife, we didn't really seek treatment until fall 2018. Prior to that, it was failed attempts at counseling, marriage counseling, Licensed Alcohol Drug Counselors, ER visits, false diagnoses of ""post-partum depression,"" and other things. 

While it's really only been a year of her attempting to treatment via AA and other means, in the past year...

\- (7) trips to the ER; 3 of them via ambulance because we could not get her there or she was about to die.

\- 90 days spent in rehab; the first time was 30 days; the second 60 days. Neither of which 'stuck'.

\- She's lied about attending meetings, only to leave the house, hide drinks in her car, and come home to pass out (another binge).

\- In our first year of marriage/kids, 2015-2016, we had the Child protective services called on us for an investigation into child welfare because of my phone call for the ambulance/911 and also because a friend thought it ""would help."" Both times I was cleared, but given temporary supervision/guardianship.

\- She's spent a whole week in the hospital because her vitals were bad, racking up medical bills in excess of $40,000, of which she owes $10,000. 

\- She missed New Year's, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween and other special days, like her Sister's engagement party and grandmother's 90th birthday. Everyone in my wife's family knows, this is no longer a hidden issue. 

My wife is presently living at her parents, because Rehab is not an option I will pay for and she wants to focus on AA, therapist/counselor and refocusing her life. I already paid the 1st round of rehab for $20,000 last year, which never panned out and given that she carries the medical insurance with mounting medical bills, her current option is her last. 

My wife will always be our son's mother, but the hardest part with kids won't be the leaving for me, as a husband that can support himself, it's never knowing when she's ok to attend a party and then when I get there, telling people what happened. It's when she goes on a binge and stays in bed for a weekend, never knowing if she will recover on her own or if I have to call the ambulance or escort her there. It's trying to find the stash she has hidden because if she keeps going, she'll kill herself with it. 

My wife when she drinks just goes to blackout; she can't even get drunk anymore. Her BAC every time she's had to go the ER was .35 to .60 and most doctors are astounded at her tolerance. I'll find several bottles of vodka and nips gone. One time, in July, she was so bad, she crapped the bed, pissed it, and vomited. She couldn't even move. I had to clean her up with our son gone, drag her the hospital, literally, bring her the ER, all the while she was crapping on me and in our truck. When I got her there, they immediately thought it was an overdose of drugs and offered narcan. The nurse on duty said, ""no she's just drunk, she's a regular.""

Presently my wife is committed to AA and the 90 for 90, but there's something beneath the alcoholism, ON TOP of the addiction itself. Yes, they are addicted, but there's an underlying issue they may never face. For example, is it depression, anxiety, abuse? In my wife's case, I believe it's mental health issues, on top of anxiety/depression, but she grew up in a 'perfect' household and to this day, as much as her parents are involved, they've never gone to Al-Anon and have often blamed me, the husband for ""triggering"" her. They see their daughters (my wife's sister is also an alcoholic and just had her wedding cancelled by the Fiance because he found her drinking like my wife), as 'good people,' not 'deserving of this."" 

Literally, yesterday was my SIL's wedding and it was cancelled so she could go into rehab. I've told my wife I don't entirely think she's a good person, because we are defined by our choices and she hasn't chosen wisely, in spite of ALL the help, love and support she is getting. I've said the same of her sister, who I brought to the ER 4 years for the same reasons, and she knew well that she had issues and never got it treated. So Fast Forward 3-4 years, and many failed relationships, and my SIL is doing the same, so the fiance, with only 3 months to go, calls off the wedding and tells her the only way she's going to consider marrying her is if she's get help. So, SIL goes to rehab for 30 days and time will tell. However, this was present 4 years ago, and neither have done or are doing anything...until something worth something is ON THE LINE. 

Most people won't change UNTIL they have to. I learned that the hard way. At the 39, though, I'm not wasting day 1 of life if she is going to drink and relapse. I do know people who have recovered...but 40 years later, or 10 years later, after a failed marriage, or business, or lost children. Rarely do I see it without significant lost unless the person does a MAJOR 180. My wife's sponsor used and abused drugs/alcohol for 40 years and only when she nearly died did she wake up, at like 58 and is now sober 6 years and works at it everyday. But she's a NEW person. She embraces what she did, and her new life and has renewed hope, love and joy. 

My uncle is an alcoholic and he lost his wife, 4 kids and nearly his business. That's what snapped him out of it, but he also filed for divorce, remarried twice over and just now, at 60 is ok. He doesn't want alcohol and has been sober 15 years. But yale or jail, people can get sober, and either people get well, or they die trying, or just die too soon. There's not really any happy mediums with this. 

I've resigned myself to filing for divorce if/when I let her home and have contacted an attorney."

What if she picks up the Sam Darnold of the week and loses 6-8 points?

What if you pick up the wrong guy and get 6-8 points and lose?

I think in this case, even though it might be a cool tactic and not a dick move, what's the ""temperature"" of the league on such things? Is this league like the show THE LEAGUE, where it would be looked upon as funny or 'acceptable' or will it ruin the vibe of a money league and lead to coaches leaving? 

A rule can't be written here and GM's cannot legislate morality, but this is one of those stunts/tactics that you need to know your league. 

The league I'm in, all guys and $200 buy-in, would probably be ok with it. But I ended up setting off such a future war of those things happening that I'd screw myself in the long-run, so it isn't winning in the short-run. Also, it shows less skill.

At the moment I'm streaming QBs with Ryan hobbled and while our league is active on an FB group, I try to keep a low-profile and make moves. I offer trades and such, but if I did this, it means everyone would start doing it, so you'd have to expect that waivers, outside of FA, becomes broken. Also, would it ruin your seasonal cap on transactions? My league has a 100 transaction cap, and we're at week 8. There is 7 more weeks to go. I could see this creating more problems than the points are worth."

Fant had a bad game, but Flacco also went to him on several deep targets. He had 5 targets, 1 catch and would have been closer to 100 yards. He isn't this bad...there's a learning curve for sure. If Flacco or Lock aren't this bad, he may be the biggest beneficiary of Sanders leaving. Maybe Lindsey."
AlAnon,f4rn794,t3_dlbezn,1571769658.0,"> The lying is killing me. I basically feel, what's the point of having an intimate relationship if you are not being honest with each other? 

This hit the nail on the head for me. As a husband to an alcoholic wife and son of 4.5 years old, the lying knows no bounds, imo. They can fund every rationalization, every justification, from shame, to guilt, to addiction; that voice in their head crowds over everything we know. Their 'voice' is not speaking through the fog; the poison-addicted voice is louder and needs to be sated and silenced. 

I can't tell you what to do. My personal realization after I've witnessed my wife doing more insane things everytime she relapses is that I have to set standards and boundaries for ME and our son and new me, won't be with an alcoholic that is relapsing. Presently, my wife lives with her parents outside of our home and visits to be part of our son's social activities and life. However, we tried Rehab/detox twice, at great expense last year. Between work, costs, and life, going for a third time was not practical or affordable. 

I've crystallized in my mind (hit rock bottom), that I'm not going back. I deserve to be happy, just as she is choosing to be miserable. Maybe she didn't choose the disease, or genetics, but she's also not choosing the hard path to sobriety and health. My wife's relapses are not minor incidents; each time she does, her BAC hits .45-.6, requires medical attention and gets blackout drunk in our bedroom for days or a week. She lies and lies and lies. The few times I trusted her at home to recover, she'd lie about attending a meeting, buy more alcohol, hide it in her vehicle and pass out. I've tired of her abuse while drunk, her lack of owning what she does and her denial. 

In my wife's case, having dealt with this for 4 years now and known her for 14 years, she is of the mindset that she can merely attend meetings, have a sponsor and do these things without opening her soul and cracking open the 'why' you'd drink 2 points of Vodka in an hour and pass out in front of your family. Or why you'd drive drunk. Or why you'd continuously lie time and time again. Such people don't deserve the family they may have before them, while I feel for her, I'm not 'enabling' this disease by providing a home to do it in, or covering her bills indirectly by paying for a home or life, or even being the 'good' parent to our child, because that's what it has been. 

I find that the longer this has dragged on for me, the less hope I have for her true recovery, the more I understand the disease and struggles, the more the BAD column fills up and Good is depleted, the EASIER it gets to make what was once a TOUGH choice and make the easier choice (Leave, file for divorce and move on). And that's where I'm at. I've consulted with two attorneys and found one I like. I know the steps I need to take and deserve the life I'm also willing to give, but I cannot give what I am to someone who can't reciprocate it, or accept it, or be good and healthy. 

I also don't want to 'harden' against love and life, and facing this disease every day is seriously affecting my ability to be a good husband and partner down the road, as I'm sure many of you have also experienced. My wife has been outside the home almost 29 days now, but only sober 14 days. I asked her to leave and get help 29 days ago, and her parents offered her short-term accommodations until she checked into rehab or a similar place (half-way house maybe?) and she opted not to go. Instead, she claimed she went to start an IOP program, rented a cheap motel and within 10 days, we hadn't heard from her, I filed a Wellness check and Missing Person's report with our town to find that she was once again passed out drunk in a hotel room, needing medical attention and had cut herself quite well when she dropped alcohol bottles in her cheap motel room and was too drunk to clean up.

Now, maybe Al-Anon would suggest ""that's her path"" and certainly a friend who's a recovering alcoholic of 6 years ( was an addict for 40 years) coached otherwise; to detach, let her go and find her bottom. I do believe I feel compelled to intercede when I can if her life is in danger. I can't and won't hover around her, but if I happen upon her in a state where she could die, I had to do everything possible to save her and I did."
fantasyfootball,f4rh7k5,t1_f4qb5o1,1571767464.0,"Edmonds is the guy. He was splitting carries two weeks prior to this explosion in production. Edmonds will split time moving forward, was more effective, efficient and dynamic, and with tons of money in DJ, AZ isn't going to keep putting him out there to get hurt. 

I'd put Edmonds in a flex spot or if you're feeling saucy, like he may have another game like this, play him as an RB2 until we know differently. I foresee the AZ and LAR backfields as being time shares moving forward and worth rostering someone, but Edmonds is the unquestioned handcuff/starter/split-back. Unfortunately, DJ has back and ankle issues and this isn't the first year he's had them. The back won't heal unless he gets significant time off (more than a bye week) as all it takes is one ding and it acts up and he's out. 

I'd feel very confident putting Edmonds in flex and letting him ride. Granted, you may 'match-ups, but there will come games that guys bust that narrative and outplay the purported match-up to go from flex to RB1 status. I'm not saying that's Edmonds or it isn't, but the right frame-work of where to slot him says ""ok, if I expect 10pts+ from a flex, I'll get that Edmonds, everything else is gravy."" I was stupid last week and left Miles Sanders in (boo) and should have just followed my own advice, but I left the Flex open for Miles Sanders and Robby Anderson. It wouldn't change whether I won or loss, as I have Matt Ryan and his whole 2 points, plus Gallup and Golladay puking killed me this week. 

Point is, I'm wary of the Lions backfield b/c McKissic looks good and Ty isn't the true hand-cuff or back-up. That's HIGHLY speculative, imo, and you'd want to a piece of either. I think Edmonds has shown enough to warrant Rb2 or 1 status and DJ has a serious case of being out the full season soon. If I'm the DJ owner, I'd sell him speculatively for another RB, because that's a bomb on your roster waiting to him. Keeping up starting DJ with the expectation he'll produce then leave early will hurt you more than starting Edmonds and getting Flex plays all down the line.

Bear in mind, AZ is in last place, so at some point soon, their season is done and DJ will barely play at all, esp given his current injuries, then it's the full on Edmonds show. Now is the time to stock pile for that eventuality. Get yourself in position to make the playoffs, build a roster of talent to thrive come weeks 10+ thru playoffs and you'll be ok.

Mistakes I made in past seasons was thinking I had to be dominant right to the playoffs, then when playoffs (fantasy) come the studs are sat or play time reduced because 1) the playoffs are locked up and they want to rest 'em, or 2) they didn't make the playoffs and it's time to find out what's on the roster...or injuries have piled up so it's time rest the starters anyways. 

That's how guys like Josh Allen, CJ Anderson and even Damien Williams owned it. In all other cases, it's hard to project teams that might play a 1/2 of starters. For example, if Carolina makes the playoffs, then CMC is going to see his play-time drastically reduced, same with Patriots defense, which would lock up playoffs VERY soon and start sitting vets sooner than later. 

A guy for later might be Derrius Guice. He can't come back until week 11, but all those WAS rbs are injured and I think but the back of the year, they will want to evaluate what they have and all you need is volume in some cases, matched with talent. Also, Drew Lock is a possibility. He hasn't even played yet, but late season additions will bring value other's aren't seeing."

fantasyfootball,f4jv4qr,t1_f4hz0u4,1571626868.0,"I had this convo with my buddy who I've played Season Long FF with for almost 20 years now and our main interest is DFS, because season-long with a team who has a solid bench is partially DFS anyways. I'd have lost with Edmonds anyways, because Matt Ryan went down on me, but only because I dumped Goff a few weeks back when OJ Howard went bust on me and I had to improvise at other spots. 

A few key changes as compared to 15 or so years ago is driving my thinking on this and the trend:

1) Less rushing attempts per team, leading to less solid or known RB1's, less top rushers, less ""Plug and Play"" studs and more boom/bust RBs. There's only about 6 backfields right now with a locked in 15+ touch back, week in, week out. Henry, DJ, Zeke, Kamara, Barkley, CMC. Anyone else? Even then, production is suspect. 15 or so years ago, most weeks you could count on 20 carries, 80 yards and 1 td to that ONE back (check the sites, I have and it's depressing)

2) More passing attempts per team, leading to a less clear #1 WR, less value at QB or delineation between QBs, less ""plug and play studs"" and more boom/bust WRs. This year and the past few years make it apparent. Today Golladay was shut out while Marvin Jones blew up. Godwin is a #1 , consistently and reliably, but Evans has had one blow up week, one good week, and the rest duds (4 weeks of duds relative to his ADP). 

The league i'm in starts 1 QB, 2 WR, 1 Flex wr/rb, 2 rbs, 1 TE, 1 defense and 1 kicker. ""Any given sunday"" is the motto, because of the slim pickings, you either walk into buzzsaws ready to blow up who get all of the production OR you min/max based on your bench. The only way I could see correcting the inequity in this league would be superflex and another WR slot, because there's much more randomness in our league. I'm the new guy, though, who just entered a league that's been around 10+ years and when I floated the idea of Superflex, a few long-term members outright said ""they'd quit.""

Problem is, I have to outwit them based on match-up, projection, and bench depth. Competing through FAAB to 'outbid' the next guy rarely works, because it's just a pissing match for who can outbid who. I happened to buyout Edmonds two weeks ago and watched as his usage, production and efficiency ticked up to AT LEAST Flex appeal, maybe RB2 depending on your team. Rarely, though, do the 'fantasy guru's even talk about this kind of framing. Rather, they give you rankings based on what's happening.

Again if you owned DJ and Edmonds, I can see the DJ owner just playing DJ. However, if you owned Edmonds your consideration was his prior usage/floor, relative to your team. In my case, I should have started him over Sanders (esp. because I was glancing at my phone while at church to know if DJ was in or out). I made a poor choice in the moment because I was ""anchored"" to miles sanders being a #1 back and the presence of DJ vulturing too much production. Didn't matter, I'd lose anyways and I learned better about my process. 

The comparison though would be Gurley and Henderson. Last week Henderson looked better than Brown, so I grabbed Henderson and dropped Gurley. Gurley looked a bit better, but Henderon's lack of usage didn't indicate if it was just the plays he received. It seemed more silly to me given that they'd want to save Gurley for the season, why they'd use him now if he's nicked up? 

Edmonds is running better anyways, even in match-ups DJ should be running better. There's just no backs who give the same consistent touches and targets like the 'elite few' which is rather sad and maddening for fantasy, because it means if you don't get one of those guys, you can't make it up with better WRs (look at Hopkins vs Fuller, or Thielen vs Diggs). QBs throwing it more means more WRs can blow-up, so it benefits the team who also gets the Elite RB to play waivers or prudently draft a WR that can blow later. There's also far great DEPTH at WR now than RB ever. ZERO RB is not a viable strategy, especially because ""next man up"" on most teams just means still being part of an RBBC, unlike 10-15 years ago where 1 back would get the bulk of the carries, that just isn't the case today in the passing league we face. 

QBs also being 'watered' down means those QBs that are functional as passers who also RUN, are more highly regarded than the true passer. Rogers or Ryan or Brady may have occasional blow-up game, but Wilson, Lamar, Murray, Allen, or Dak will yield greater benefit because if they can't get it done through the air, there's always the ground game with a nice floor to most point totals. Minshew, Cousins, Rivers, even Trubisky put up respectable numbers. There's not much 'skill' or reliability that can be found in determing backfields."
fantasyfootball,f4jlsao,t3_dkmglg,1571621874.0,"And yet, that's not what's been reported or what coaches said?

DJ hasn't looked right since the start and I feel for the dude, he's one of my favorites."
fantasyfootball,f4jhljn,t1_f4iy4yu,1571619693.0,"At least we are all together in our collective misery. Edmonds is likely the difference between a win and loss for me, like so many others. I was tossing up between Edmonds, Henderson, Sanders and Anderson. I leaned on Sanders, figuring with rushing/receiving MAYBE he'd match Edmonds output if something finally changed for him, like it did Edmonds.

I argued back and forth on twitter with a 'well known' fantasy guru about the Edmonds situation and for what I thought was good reason. 

\- Most fantasy info is junk. I sub to Football [guys.com](https://guys.com), Pro Foot ball focus and perviously bought Chris Harris' material, as did look into Establishtherun and Four for Four. Listening to most podcasts, too. The argument was over noticing Edmonds potential, forget what the coaches dictate, because we cannot trust them, hence so many split backfields (Duke Johnson/Hyde, Rojo/Barber, Howard/Sanders, Patriots, etc). 

My 'gripe' is that it's often the outliers that win a day or DFS. While I'm not going to nitpick starting Edmonds over Barkley and Henry, who are my 2rbs I primary start and that kind of projection is beyond anything but DFS, DJ has had 2 zero games in our league, 2 RB1 performances and 3 RB2 performances (17 points or less, RB1 will produce 20-25). Leading up to Edmonds breakout game, he had 2 RB 2 performances and now the RB1 production. At worst, he'd be an Rb2, with RB1 upside IF DJ got nicked in a game or was merely a backup, as he was here.

What I never heard on (1) podcast this week or on 1 website was this kind of commentary phrased that way. As someone who works in finance having read the works of Buffet and Taleb, as well as many other's, the point here is:

1) Small sample sizes lead to huge outliers in football. Jones game with 4 tds. Rogers game with 6 tds. Evans game with 4 tds. Aaron Jones game with 4 tds. Edmonds game today with 3 tds, against a bad defense. (Taleb). Reading ""thinking in bets"" and ""fooled by randomness"" helped me solidify my thinking here that 'gurus' need more depth than the numbers we all can search on ProFootballStats, etc. The information we need, sans teams, is how coaches coach, the subtle nuances we, as lay players, don't know. This is the 'shark' kind of thinking on why Marvin Jones might get 4 tds because he'd be the ""next best target"" since Golladay was totally shut down today. 

2) Buffet. The purpose of Buffet is that he doesn't just read annual reports, he can intuitively see beyond the numbers. After a week of listening to various podcasts and websites, they all blurted out the same thing. Yet, Edmonds was at a MINIMUM an RB2. If you're a DJ owner, I get why you are pissed, because it's an ""either or"" situation, especially if you own Edmonds. However, the writing was on the wall, that he's been splitting carries for 2 weeks prior to today's full carry load.

In addition, Edmonds Yards per attempt have been over 6, NOT counting today. DJ's has been under 4, up to today. 10-15 years ago, before the podcast and internet explosion, this is the kind of 'easy' data that a team would sniff out, start Edmonds on the growing trend that he's taking over the position, or at least going to get half the carries because he's playing well. See: San Franciso, Eagles, Patriots, Bucs, Packers, etc. It's clear to me Edmonds is at least the best back this season and warrants Rb2/flex play every week. If DJ gets no carries or is injured, he's an RB1. 

Granted, this was a cake defense and I did start Giants against AZ (with Carolina on bye), so it won't always be this easy. But, he's getting lead horse work loads and worth such consideration. I don't think it's outrageous to expect that 'fantasy guru's' didn't see this coming. Just as one might say ""Don't trust Bill B,"" is hard to understand the injuries DJ has suffered, coach speak, and fact AZ had no 3rd back? If DJ is nursing ankle and back injuries, neither bode well for his l/t play this season, because either can be aggravated anytime. It's sad; I really like DJ, but as a non-DJ owner, it's a spot where players ought to be able to profit."

$230 auction budget, money league

Invariably, the tilt is toward high level floor scoring with pop-off capability to go nuclear (i.e. CMC, Barkley, WR blow up days ala Evans, Diggs) and high average scoring qbs. In hindsight, the mistake wasn't drafting TE, it wasn't being quick on WW pick-ups at TE. Although Dissly went down, he was a great option. Same as Witten. Putting up a goose egg isn't good, but guys who spent up on Ertz or Kelce, aren't getting the expected production relative to the $ spent.

In fact, if there's any place you make your hay in a money league, it's what you do in the end. The weird mentality of our league, and this is my 2nd year in the league, doing it LIVE, in-person, is that it functions more like hold'em poker than actually a draft, because so much psychology and gamesmanship goes into the bidding.

I bid 70 on Barkley, 29 on Henry, and less than that on other RBS (Sanders, Drake etc). Dalvin Cook went for 40. Gordon and Zeke 50, because of their hold-outs. It makes no sense to pay up at WR, where Brown and Beckham and Adams and Jones went at 60. CMC went for 74, and Lamar Jackson of all people went for $1, because he was perceived as a back-up to a guy like Rogers or Brady who was drafted highly. 

Because of the tilting and cheat-code scoring in the league, I suspect next year guys like Murray and Jackson will get bid up, as will CMC and other top tier 3 down backs, however, it will leave opportunity at WR and rookie rbs or rbs not performing this year.

Outside of 5-6 tes it didn't matter. The guy who got Hooper paid $1, because most guys perception was to ""all in on the main line-up"" then have like $5 left to fill benches. I think that's a mistake; I had $40 when I finished my 'main' line up and could get who I wanted, except that I didn't fill it with great picks...Goff, Drake, Sanders, Darwin Thompson, Christian Kirk and Mike Williams. 

I didn't jump quick enough on DJ Chark or Terry McLaurin and worse still, my FAAB budget is gone, so I have to work waviers ahead of the weekend, rather than what transpires after the weekend ends. It isn't the end of the world, because I think FAAB is pointless; I'd rather get a guy now, than bid up because he had one weekend of good production. 

Also, top 6 make the playoffs and with Barkley going down, my goal has been to get into that top 6, with the best bench and roster possible and THEN win. In our league, whoever gets you there isn't often who wins it, because 3 weeks of playoffs with an elite roster means some or all will see reduced playing time or have no time. I hated that change, because if I wasn't active at stock piling rookies now who'd get time at the end (Josh Allen), then I wouldn't win anyways. I figured my drafted roster would be sufficient to get me to the playoffs and with good in-season management, I'd be able to compile a solid line up of guys playing at the back end of the season when it's winter and most teams are running more and defense plays heavier. 

Guys like Baker went for $40! The same price as Dalvin Cook! Positional scarcity is at TE and RB in our, esp. the back who catches passes. WR and TE vary so much and QB production is not worth a lot, that it makes sense to pay big around a core of RBs that catch, get good WRs like Godwin, Chark. 

Frankly, I don't the roster is good, though, because with such limited starting it plays more like DFS leagues, than season-long fantasy. A team that gets lucky at the draft can ride out a bevy of wins, no matter what. The guy with the Patriots defense, also has Aaron Jones and Aaron Rogers and Chris Godwin. When he finished, he hated his team and most would say that wouldn't match-up to other teams, but he's top 3 and hasn't really worked the wire. He has no bench depth, no back-ups and outside of Godwin, no WRs. He's streaming TE, but with a short roster of high performers, he's a high point scorer because the league tilts to funneling points. Pats D has put up 20 a week. Aaron jones big day next him 50+ points. 

I think at TE, though, I've become more analytic, understanding targets, playing time, snap counts, etc, that I knew I'd figure it out and see what developed. Looking at Chris Herndon, possibly sticking with Noah Fant as Drew Lock comes back, or returning to Oj Howard or Witten, should be sufficient. I tried making a trade for Waller, but even he's losing time/snaps/targets to Morneau and had a brief injury.

My current roster is:
QB: Matt Ryan
RB: Barkley, Henry, Sanders, Drake, Henderson, Edmonds, Johnson
WR: Evans, Golladay, Anderson, Gallup
TE: Fant (or Herndon, Goedert, Howard, Witten, all on Waivers)
D: Panthers 
K: Elliott

I don't think anyone would have projected Hooper this high and taking Henry meant many weeks of injury to endure without IR spot. Howard, last season had a reasonable floor, but this season, no floor. Kelce has been ok, but he went for the price of a WR, and I think now he's even lower. Same with Ertz. Engram was reasonably priced, and Waller may have gone for $1. 

The price is almost irrelevant, tbh, because any guy you think can be the stud is worth. The biggest cost is in NOT taking the right guy and right combination for your team. Even paying up for Patriots D, which went for $4, seems insane, b/c they've exceeded expecations. CMC going for 74 is non-sense, because he's worth a lot more than Kamara, Barkley, Zeke or Gordon this year; he's single-handedly winning match-ups and combined with a Pats D or Lamar Jackson or Murray, the team is presently unstoppable. The question will be, what happens come playoffs when things change for good or bad for most teams?"
fantasyfootball,f48r114,t1_f476uu3,1571446466.0,"Outside of Hooper, Kelce, Henry (2 games back), Waller, Kittle and, Engram, TE is a wasteland. 

Those TE's are consider almost WR 2 or 3, occasionally 1. I made the mistake of drafting Howard with no back plan, now I'm streaming Fant, Howard, maybe Herndon, possibly Witten and maybe even Goedert. 

I've lowered my expectations to a few targets, but Flacco just plain sucks. I watched the game, like many, and Fant was targeted on absolute bombs and he just didn't catch them, but at least he's getting bombs. Now he just needs to hold onto them. I don't think it's that he sucks, or won't blow-up. If Drew Lock ends up back in, like Danny Dimes, it's a big upgrade. Flacco has always been awful, he just benefited from a great Ravens defense, now people are aware to how bad he truly is. 

I'll probably pivot to Herndon, even though there are lots of Targets there, because Darnold had the chemistry from last year and Herndon is an absolute beast. As another redditor point out, most TEs have to be efficient with their targets, because of their high levels of blocking and often splitting time with other TEs. Very few TEs even have the offense to themselves; Kelce, Gronk, Hooper, Henry and Kittle come to mind, but even Waller is splitting time with Morneau now on the come-up, as is Ertz with his declining production, targets and snaps. 

We either pay up and hope things continue as is for these top TEs, or pay down and hope we land on a gem of a TE that is very efficient  and/or doing less blocking and more designed plays for their role."

Otherwise, who else might it be? Even a solid 3-5 catches would be a big upgrade from most spots this year. No Gronk, Ertz production down, no Dissly now, lack of a MINN TE and on and on."

Whether your emotional outburst is caused by marital strife/discourse or not, this is not a healthy way of behaving toward one another. Perhaps an example of what you are needing soothing for would be helpful to those responding, however NEEDING to give a partner something on demand is not what marriage is about...unless my wife came to be medically or clinically diagnosed with something OR it was something at levels of trauma, like death, medical/health issues, job loss, etc. But without describing the event, it's rather hard to put into context.

\- Cheering each other up.

I haven't read in your comments why you need 'cheering up', but if you are more specific that would be helpful. If I'm in need of cheering up, and I can't do it myself, or I'm not happy with life to be cheerful, then that's on me and maybe I need to speak to a doctor, counselor, etc. Or, if it is a traumatic event, like the death of a loved one and my wife did not show empathy, kindness, love or support, I'd have serious concerns about our marriage and/or her health (mental, behavioral). We cannot control our spouse, though we'd like to think we can, we can't, and that's the start of marital issues.

\------------------------------------------

I mention this because how you are speaking is how my wife spoke and she suffers from depression, partial boarderline personality disorder and is a recovering alcoholic, who used alcohol to cope with her extreme emotions, felt it was my duty to 'cheer' her up and regulate her emotions. Before we entered counseling and I start with AL-ANON (something I recommend to everyone), I was blind to these facts and took it upon myself to 'manage' and be responsible for her emotions, while burying mine. 

If you've had these conversations with your husband, it's possible he's throwing the towel in on this and retreating. Or, if he's never before been 'that type of guy,' then maybe he's just not built that way (read the Five Love Languages). Or, maybe he's overwhelmed with 'managing' your emotions, soothing you and helping you cope with a lack of cheerfulness. Men and women are different and then as we dig deeper into our emotional complexes, even deeper than that.

Your expectations, though, as you're finding out, are not commonly shared by healthy, functioning relationships. I don't even think it's my wife's job to 'cheer' me up; just being around her is cheerful to me. I don't have bad days at work, because I look for the blessings around me. It isn't about 'burying problems; certainly if there are legitimate concerns, then by all means, act on them. By letting your emotions be swept around by every whim of the day, work or life, is incredibly exhausting and speaks to other things you may want to look into."

Now, with the exception of 6 or so players, maybe 8, every other backfield is in a time-share and quite often they have fantastic talent that could produce if (1) RB was to get 15-25 carries, rather than the 10-15 we often see. 

Half my bench are guys in time-shares who's production on limited carries is far better than the other time-share...

\- Duke Johnson

\- Kenyan Drake

\- Miles Sanders

\- Darrell Henderson

\- Chase Edmonds

I can list a number of other players. Granted, it's insurance for the inevitable injury and no amount of touches will ward off the injury bug, but what's the point of splitting so much time when all it takes is one injury to knock a back down completely?

But you're right, there isn't a spot I can fathom that's good for his move, UNLESS his limited carries are more beneficial than where he's in MIA. We roster White, Rojo, Montgomery, etc, on limited carries and that's how I cashed in last year on Chubb. That's how teams are cashing in on Howard/Sanders, and even at times profiting off Henry/Lewis. Certainly GB is a good, but frustrating backfield depending on where you get your backs. 

I'd love a shocker of the Chiefs grabbing Drake, perhaps cutting some backs here and fully using Drake. They can either draft an RB or play RB roulette. Another team who might bite would Washington, as Thompson is dinged up, who knows how Guice will be or if he'll just come back and get injured and Peterson is another season older. Buffalo may be an option, with older Gore and Singletary, perhaps Tenn because Lewis hasn't been effective and with Henry, maybe want someone to be let go. I could see Atlanta, as a Coleman fill-in, since ito Smith isn't doing much and Freeman has only just come on. Finally, people talk about Tampa Bay, but that makes sense only if Barber or RoJo takes a seat or is cut/let go. My other call is Pittsburg, as Samuel is dinged, Connor is dinged and oft injured, and then there's only Benny Snell. At least Drake is a vet and the team would get a compensatory pick if he leaves next year or they could option to sign him. 

Those are my takes at least on the deficient backfield landscape."
AlAnon,f42mb4d,t3_dj91ey,1571333383.0,"What about \*you\*? 

I came to that realization when I sat in my counselors office this past week (and all those before it) when I'd dish about the latest catastrophe with my wife. When things were 'ok', which lasts about 2-3 weeks, I could focus on me, but the minute she had a flare up, a mega relapse, or well just did as she always, drank heavily, I'd put the focus right back on her. Life would stop. We'd all rally around getting her the hospital, packing her bag, thinking about 'what treatment options' might work or could be afforded or that she'd agree to and when she would dig her heals in, we'd leave her at the hospital longer, coax her somewhere and she'd either come home or go to her parents and the cycle would inevitably restart. 

Since it is Al-Anon, I can only speak to me, what I'd do and give no specific advice. However, I can't manage her disease. And I'll have negative feelings so long as I think I can. My \*dis-ease\* is not having boundaries, boarders, standards and realizing, maybe it isn't meant to be? Maybe I've gone long enough on this journey with my wife as I can, and soon, or now, it will be time to part ways. Maybe we came together for the purpose of our higher purpose (our son and to awaken me to change and Al-Anon) and it's time to move on. 

I met with another divorce attorney today, because I'm at that point. I won't bore you dear poster with what's gone on, because ""we've all been there in one form or another,"" as members of the Al-Anon family. The faces change, but the stories are largely the same. And saying out loud what my wife has done, what we've been through, and realizing that she's only been sober 12 days, makes me feel like I'm in the twilight zone, only now I'm doing things differently. That I HAVE to CHOOSE ME. That maybe divorce is the only thing that can cure her, but I'm not using it for that reason.

Instead, I'm setting standards, because I got into this situation because I didn't. I didn't want to believe my higher power, or my gut, or any of that when we met years ago and the alcohol was there. Rarely does someone go from light drinker or non-drinker to full blown alcoholic; in most cases, the red flags were always there. I know for my situation, it most definitely was. But I also stuck with my wife because I didn't expect the best of myself, or think I was worth it. She was ok looking past my short-comings, and lack of confidence, that I could work on and I would do the same for her. She'd never speak to it, but she knows I'm the only man who'd stick around through the chaos and non-sense, regardless of how cute or sexual she might be. 

Point is, I don't believe there's anything we can do 'about them' and for me I had to realize I have to be ok NOW, otherwise when she does make attempts to get well, I will never be well, and that's no way to live. I have that going on now, as my wife lives with her parents, since rehab was mostly out of the question and that is if she does in fact have sobriety/recovery over a longer time period than before, how have I handled that? If I'm only OK in life so long as she's ok...that's no way to live, that's co-dependent. My emotional state had always been in flux; one day we stay together if she's sober, the next I'm ready to go if she's a drunkard. That's not good for anyone, least of all our son who's 4.5 years old and the love of our life."
Fantasy_Football,f3xw7e3,t1_f3xpvsr,1571244877.0,"The play here is Henderson, as he's more dynamic. If Todd's back, while he's in a smash spot, I think his 'bruising' means he's going to split snaps/carries going forward. Ultimately, they want Todd for the end of the season, and McVay stated ""if we need him, he's in, if we don't, he's out."" If the Rams get up, you'll see Brown/Henderson, if they don't, then they may get Gurley in, though he's definitely not as effective as in past seasons either. The line is the glaring weakness for all interested, though.

Personally, I'm playing Carson if i'm you, because he's getting both carries and targets each game. Jones is on thin ice. Fournette is also a benefactor of volume, so he's the play, too, even though he isn't as efficient with his carries and/or targets. 

If most backfields are RBBC when the #1 back is down, then you need most dynamic back and that's Henderson. I had Brown and dropped him for Henderson because I think regardless, he starts getting the carries now and finishes the season getting an increasing amount. If Gurley is going to replace Brown (goal-line, pass protection), then Henderson is going to all the other work. Brown has been 'ok' and he had those 2tds in week 1, but he won't do as much. He was re-signed to skill up/school up Henderson. 

Watch any video analysis by Matt Waldman. 

Once the injury box is opened, there's no closing it and since most backfields are committees with rare exceptions, get the back who's going to produce the best (see Chubb last year, with Duke and Hyde). 

Only situations like MINN, DAL, ARZ, have true handcuff backfields that are super valuable now and in the event the stud goes down. Those backfields should be roster holds now and if the stud goes down or is sat come playoffs, your shares of \_\_\_ player skyrocket. I'm trying to find a way to roster Mattison without screwing myself before the playoffs as I want to own as much of these guys as possible. 

But, having paid a pretty penny from Brown and seeing how Henderson operates, he's going to share time going forward and may get the full start this week or larger% of carries. LAR almost has to incorporate Henderson, on top of finding a way to improving that line, because the run game has looked dead."
fantasyfootball,f3w8cxw,t1_f3uclwd,1571194497.0,"Crowder is more of the slot guy, however Darnold likes to throw it deep. Also, Bell was getting 7+ targets/game the first few weeks, mostly on check-downs. Crowder has a role here and it's probably a solid floor play, however, he'll also challenge Chris Herndon for targets when he's back, as well as Anderson who's going to be deep shot (the 92 yard bomb this week was the longest pass of the season). 

In 2018, Darnold's first rookie season, Anderson had 94 Targets, 50 catches, 6 tds and 750 yards in a full season. Anderson really came on at the end, too, averaging 8+ targets/game. The Jets, after the Patriots, have one of the weakest schedules in the game, an improving defense and great tools all around. If the Patriots weren't in the same division, the Jets would probably be #1. Bell, Herndon, Crowder, Anderson and possibly Thomas if he's healthy (also why Crowder could lose targets to Thomas). 

Sam Darnold was also one of the highest graded QBs last season by PFF, so he 'fell' to the Jets when a team like NYG should have taken him. If I'm comparing him to Golden Tate or similar WR, I go Anderson. He's not yet in the category of Golladay or Evans/Godwin (who are true 1's), but he has the chance to finish strong as a WR3, maybe WR2 or be a very burst flex. I'm sure there will be a game or two he scores two touchdowns and racks up sufficient yards to make it worth starting him weekly. Just round him with other producers so you have a better floor for when he doesn't score as expected. 

The way I build my roster is to 'average' a certain amount across the board and occasionally it will blow up. I have:

QB: Matt Ryan
WR: Evans, Golladay, Gallup, Anderson
RB: Barkley, Sanders, Henry, Drake, Brown, Edmons
Te: Fant (trying to trade Anderson for Waller)
D: Carolina
K Elliott

*May grab Mattison or Henderson if they clear waivers; I'm out of FAAB. I also intended to grab Darnold if he clears Waivers, and needs a bye week defense fill-in.* 

We only start 2 rbs, 2 wrs, 1 flex wr/rb, 1 te, so our league operates more like a dfs play, than a pure plug and play leave 'em. My bench is solid and I had at least 15 points or more per guy on the bench, as scoring 120 often wins in our league each week, unless someone really goes off. A guy like Anderson or Gallup, etc, should provide a baseline of points and then have solid weeks and occasionally pop the top off. Having Evans is frustrating, but he's also a core piece of the offense, and for TB to win, often Evans ""has to get his."" I'd drafted OJ Howard not really realizing at the time that for two WRs to be good and a TE to be drafted that high, Winston would have to be a top 10 QB and I didn't believe that, nor draft him for that. 

But look at a team like ATL that has a terrible defense, so Matt Ryan is on a career march this season for over 5000 yards. He's lifting ""all boats"" with this tide of production, from Jones, to Freeman, to Hooper, to Ridley and Sanu, we have to work from the QB/offense/OC plan, back to the possible production. In the Jets case, Darnold does have the arm, accuracy, confidence and desire to chuck the ball down field, as well as the team to provide for him, between play-action to Bell, to good talent that will keep a defense honest. 

Seeing a switch at QB in Tenn also means possible increase to offense there, between Walker, Davis, and Brown to Lewis and Henry. If Tannehill can keep defenses honest, then it opens up more running room and production. Both Davis and Brown aren't; Mariotta is just awful. But I think in year four now, Anderson has legit talent establish and proven and it's just up to him and Darnold to show it. 

I mean in 2017, Anderson had 114 targets, 63 receptions, 941 yards, and 7 tds. If anything, adding Bell, Crowder and Herndon takes pressure OFF Anderson to become who he might be who he is. Also, 2017 Josh McCown was throwing to Anderson!"
fantasyfootball,f3w6kve,t1_f3vx0cn,1571193255.0,"For the market to reset, GMs & owners would have to throw the towel and think differently (ala Patriots way). Granted, Pats have 'lucked' out with finding Brady, much in the same way that Seattle lucked into Wilson, KC into Mahomes and perhaps Baltimore lucked into Jackson. Having a rookie QB on a team friendly contract allows a team to grow, flourish and push deep into the playoffs. But in the Patriots case, Brady would restructure his contract, because he's also 'nothing' without a good oline. 

It'd seem more likely that it's an issue of managing the teams, evaluating the talent and building the roster. There's a lack of talent going around, but giving away picks is Anti-Patriot, which has lead to its Dynasty. Unfortunately for the Rams, though, Goff isn't Wilson, so when the contracts are done, not only will LA not have picks or young talent from these latest drafts, but they also won't have a good QB left to rebuild around. It's very possible LAR will be 'tanking' like Miami has been. LAR has long had some of the best talent around and still done fuck all with it. It blows my mind...Cooks, Kupp, Woods, even now Everett, Gurley and other's. Not to mention Donald, Talib, etc. The WRs Goff has had for several season (albeit injured or concussed) rival those of what Brady or Peyton had during their pinnacle seasons and Brady had for one game this year with Brown, Edelman and Gordon (and Gordon isn't even really on par with those receivers given his mental and health issues).

I think LAR will be competitive at times, but they won't match up well with SF that's well-built and getting better and stronger every week."
fantasyfootball,f3uc0zr,t1_f3ubjj1,1571157147.0,"I'd drop Chargers and not look back. Their schedule is iffy, esp at playoffs when you need them, while SF is a top-ranked defense PAST their bye week. In my league, the lowest they've scored is 6, and have posted 10, 19 and 27 points. They're for real! 

They also have juicy match-ups when it'll count, Arizona (rookie QB) x2, NO, and this week, Washington!? What. Chargers schedule isn't great and brother Bosa and company aren't performing well. Too many injuries on that defense, too, piling up. I think they were sold as a solid defense by names, and have some stats, but you need a good schedule and to hold opponents down in points, not just get sacks and ints which are random."
fantasyfootball,f3ub8d6,t1_f3u9itb,1571156691.0,"Anderson. He's going to carve the top off the Defense. He's in year 4 (normally WR blow up by year 3) and his year 3 was marked by Darnold's first year as rookie QB. Herndon is due back in a week or two, and Bell will catch alot of balls more so eating into Crowder than Anderon's time. I think Anderson will be a boom/bust guy, but he can blow-up and give you 100 and a td or two going forward. Their schedule is cake after New England, too, so it's reasonable that he's a big producer soon. 

I'm actually trading away Anderson as I have Evans, Gallup, and Golladay (we start 2 wrs, plus 1 flex wr/rb) for Waller, only b/c I have no TE. I drafted Howard, grabbed Fant, and may grab Herndon too, but if I can swap that production into a Te spot, I'll do it."
fantasyfootball,f3uaxr8,t1_f3u9qr0,1571156519.0,"Depends on your defense, but I'd probably lean SF over tate. 

Back into what NYG would have to look like to make a Tate waiver payoff, esp. compared to what you have. How many WR or flex spots do you have to start? Is this a bye week fill-in or just a spec play? Are you looking to keep them from another team? 

IMO, the peace of mind with a strong defense (CAR, PAT, SF) adds huge 'alpha' at a slot that's hard to come by, otherwise you're streaming defenses against bad offenses and praying (STEELERS week 8 for example). In most cases, you're starting Fuller, Mclaurin, then Kirk over Tate. Tate has too many mouths to feed once that offense is healthy, between Shep, Engram, and Barkley, that it'd have to be a huge blow out game or a big funnel game for Tate to see meaningful targets and production, imo. I could be wrong, but they are building like Philly, without reliable production. If I'm limited or it's bye weeks, then a guy like Tate is a WR3 to me. 

WR1: McLaurin (he's their primary go to and this offense won't produce if he doesn't feast); Fuller, while D-hop is here, it's evident IF Fuller can catch, he's also a 1. It may be the JuJu/Brown case, though, where Fuller is only good b/c Hop is drawing coverage (same with Godwin/Evans). 

WR2: Kirk - ARIZONA moves fast and once Kirk is back to healthy, Fitz and Kirk are rolling. Johnson already being hurt means Kirk can eat or targets go to Edmonds. 

I favor Singletary Long-term over Howard and Howard isn't going to be in any negative game scripts, so if Phillies D can't hold up, Sanders gets the work long-term. To me, Howard is an at-risk RB, because Sanders will vulture more carries once he can run inside OR if they decide to trade Howard away at the end deadline (10/29) to recoup draft capital. 

What's your other defense?"
nfl,f3u1bn0,t3_di1ux7,1571150821.0,"As a Patriots fan, I've been on the receiving end of blown calls that benefited the Patriots. However, I am also a 'football' fan and enjoy watching and rooting for all kinds of teams (Saints, Seahawks, Browns, Giants) and this pissed me off enough to shut it off.

Blown calls like this add so much more to the narrative that games are fixed, that 'elite' Qbs are pampered, and that the whole game and season is pre-determined. Over the past few years, it certainly feels like the majority of egregious blown calls are in the NFC and heavily benefit a guy like Rogers. He was running for his life and he's not as good as advertised any more and I've never seen a QB or team, benefit more by the one-play bam hail mary BS that continues the story that Rogers is the GOAT. 

Rogers did have quite a few good throws not caught by his receivers that should have been, but the deep balls that were caught was 95% on the WR catching a great ball and Rogers just ""hoping the one on one coverage"" he had on an average receiver would work. The fact these deep shots were caught is more of a testament to the WR making a great catch and play than Rogers actually being good. He was often running for his life and they deserved to lose, simply because if you keep Rogers around long enough one of his BS deep shots likely will pay off with a PI call or actually being caught. It's a ticking time bomb...

The lions didn't do themselves any favors only kicking field goals, giving up the 13-0 lead or not catching a few easily catchable balls (Hock, I'm looking at you), but still those penalties were insane and overshadowed that offensive penalties were missed at the same time, as if the zebras were looking for ANYTHING to call against the lions and keep the story going."
fantasyfootball,f3siwyp,t1_f3oly6a,1571103581.0,"True. And this is why most NFL teams languish in hell for decades. Miami is doing the right thing tanking, acquiring picks and rebuilding, restarting. I don't quite think Brian Flores is the answer there, perhaps he's an interim/transitional coach until a college coach or other team comes available (ala Oakland getting Gruden and picks for 10 years to rebuild). 

The Bucs are in the middle of nowhere and given their division, won't be a contender without a legit, winning QB. They've displayed the talent on offense, but can't use it, or win with it, which is a mix of coaching and leadership. Teams get crushed under QB contracts (Rams) or over-investing in stud players, without covering their bases. The Patriot way hasn't just worked because of Brady, because there's another side to the ball (defense). It's worked because Bill and the Patriots are excellent at talent evaluation and they keep a core group, then know what pieces to acquire or release, then work and rebuild with what they have to form what they need.

But looking at some of these dumpster fires, it's evident they're more about entertainment and money, than actually winning (Jax, Mia, TB, Oak, Tenn). The rookie contract is so favorable, that setting the team up with a great qb walking in (mahomes, darnold, jones, allen) is a huge deal; it's how SEA won their SB with wilson at the helm and legion of boom, Wilson was on an insanely low contract at the time and they afford the defense they had. It's why JAX is imploding and so too soon will LA Rams; so much money tied up in Donald, Gurley and Goff, and 2 out of 3 of those are HUGE wastes of cash they will need. The Rams return to irrelevancy is happening and the rebuild is upon us; Darrell Henderson SHOULD overtake Gurley now, he isn't himself and Brown isn't the answer. They have 3 number 1 WRs and a legit top 12 TE. Their Defense on paper should be good and has never quite gelled as we thought it might and the SB revealed cracks in their armor. At best, Goff is a robot controlled by McVay under perfect circumstances. Goff bombed out against KC last year because KC has never fielded a defense."
nfl,f3ol5jx,t3_dhfsnk,1571020878.0,"I played him today, think he'd be good for 100yd, a TD and maybe more. He got me 10 points. I should have just started Miles Sanders or Robby Anderson. I firmly now believe management has told all players to 'not do their best,' pro or not. They badly want those picks, that first picks overall, the leverage it comes with and I'm sure all players will be properly taken care of. 

Drake is a possible trade piece, too, and Walton actually outperformed Drake. Mixing him in is no accident for a team THIS bad."
fantasyfootball,f3ok9m7,t1_f3o1l0x,1571020195.0,"And I foolishly drafted Howard AND Evans, when the steal was Godwin, esp. at his price point, nevermind his amazing production.

I've watched enough TB games to not want to watch Football anymore. If there's something you shouldn't do in Football, Winston will do it. He's jittery, and hesitant in the pocket. He doesn't even make a choice, he just flings it and his amazing receives bail him out. I feel for Arians, because the first person to go HAS to be Winston, he single-handedly lost this game for the Bucs and it isn't even close. Bucs should tank and get a top 5 QB Arians can groom up, from here on out. They have all the other pieces in place, from WR, to RB, to a growing defense, to competent TE's. Install a good line with some pics next year and a rookie QB and the Bucs might be decent. Plenty of great talent coming out next 2 years at WR, QB and RB, too, they could trade away anyone locked up to buy more picks, too. 

Oh, and I have Henry. I'm all for Benching Mariotta. Not that I thought I would get last year's Henry (at the end), but he is a beast, except Henry faces top 3 in most-stacked boxes, so teams know to stop the Titans, you stop Henry and make Mariotta throw, which they don't want to do, in spite of all the WR talent they've tried to surround him with. This has to be an upgrade, right? Tannehill wasn't horrible in MIA; I'd at least lean that on his talent there or gase?"
