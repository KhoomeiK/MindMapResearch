mentalhealth,fmv19mc,t3_fxjzaq,1586403605.0,That‚Äôs awesome! Congrats to you for finding your own way to ride the wave ü§ò
mentalhealth,fmgu3ds,t1_fmgu20z,1586057863.0,Absolutely!
mentalhealth,fmgssxf,t3_fv1pzs,1586056883.0,"Struggling to find words that might offer you some help and the hope that you deserve. Nobody has the right to make such toxic statements about your body, especially in your own home. That‚Äôs abuse and is a threat to your health both emotionally and physically. Does your household know the full extent of your struggles with bulimia? Or how badly this is affecting your mental health?

I‚Äôm a ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù anorexic+bulimic and understand that feeling of wanting to literally cut off your own flesh to shrink yourself. In the situation you describe, this must be absolute agony for you, especially because your privacy will be limited. For me, limited privacy and heightened scrutiny always made my anxiety shoot through the roof, then the self hatred and shame would follow... and, well, I‚Äôm guessing you know the rest...

Have you had any help with your battle in the past or currently? And are there helplines or online psychology services that you can access right now?

Try to be gentle with yourself (yeah, I know, that‚Äôs wayyyy easier said than done), and maybe you could think of some ways to avoid triggering situations like the one you described...? Please know that there are people out here who care about you, and that it is possible to get out of this hell alive.

AMAZING! X"

mentalhealth,fiw5gzb,t1_fiw36qj,1582775657.0,"Thank you so much. I‚Äôm humbled by your message and your empathy, even (and especially) while going through your own struggle. My Swamp will always be there, but one day I want to be on the other side of it, climbing my mountain into life  - no doubt clumsily, and with a few falls along the way. I hope you find your way too. I have a feeling there are great things waiting for you. X"
mentalhealth,fiw1igl,t1_fivvhl6,1582772925.0,"Even if you do wake up with regrets, try not to dwell on them. It sounds like you have done a really hard but very important thing. The Swamp is messy and imperfect and dark & so is the process of getting through it. I‚Äôm still mucking around in mine and there are days I wake up regretting. But if you don‚Äôt start, you‚Äôll never find your beginning ‚ù§Ô∏è"
mentalhealth,fivzhvi,t3_fa2b3s,1582771584.0,"Hello fellow Reddit-not-written-it friend. I totally relate to this post and am really reassured to see it. I just got back from therapy and am playing it back on loop, thinking about why I can speak calmly of suicidal thoughts and my several previous attempts too.

Thing is, ‚Äúthe suicide stuff‚Äù has been happening for so long that it is a part of my life and my story. I can‚Äôt change that. Suicide and suicidal thoughts are not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù things to talk about, so sometimes disengagement from emotions is just your brain‚Äôs way of protecting itself - from other people‚Äôs judgement as well as your own thoughts. Everyone experiences things in their own way, so we express them in our own ways too.

Just so you know, I have bipolar disorder (with a few other labels attached) so my own reactions are probably not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (whatever the hell ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is). But your comment makes sense to me in the scheme of things, and being able to talk about your experience with suicide is better than not talking about it, no matter how you are able to express it. You‚Äôve survived all those times you thought you wouldn‚Äôt and that is something to be proud of, not ashamed of! X"
mentalhealth,fivv9kx,t3_fa2pad,1582768836.0,"Massive congratulations to you! I know it really really sucks to be in ‚Äúthe swamp‚Äù (what my therapist calls it when life feels like quicksand and utterly stinks). I hope you can give yourself a little kindness for taking such a massive step. Good luck on your journey!
Arohanui x"
mentalhealth,ffwfbzu,t1_ffv9zh3,1580298900.0,"This is so real. And great advice IMO. 
Also, super non-fun fact: I keep a few 1litre glass bottles of water within reach of my bed, and always have facewipes and towels in one drawer, with some emergency snacks in another one, and then some tools for riding out the crappy weather (books, pens, paper, mini speaker etc) in another. Sounding a little like a sad squirrel rn I know, but it‚Äôs really helped to keep me alive during the real bad nights and days - especially those mornings when I need a little extra time to face the day. Also Reddit. Thank god for reddit!"
u_Zeros_Jody,ffvz4xh,t1_ffvwqco,1580277913.0,Um YES please! Perhaps they‚Äôll be my gateway drug to Keto!
u_Zeros_Jody,ffvv3ky,t1_ffvu5wo,1580274140.0,"I‚Äôm glad I did too! Thanks for your reply and good luck with your keto Oreos! 

Ps: Awesome marketing strategy/consumer outreach! Wish more companies actually ASKED their future and current clients what they would like to see (and taste, obvs)."
mentalhealth,ffvuoop,t1_fftlkh8,1580273785.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry my friend. I feel exactly the same way (about the dead part). I‚Äôve been wearing my mentalness on the outside for a long time now - kinda hard to hide it when you look down and suddenly realise you‚Äôre a severely anorexic, manic drug addict dressed in a tiger costume and refusing to come down from the roof via the stairs... but hey, life right? It‚Äôs not always easier having people know how you‚Äôre feeling (and tbh I do have days where I reaaaally wish I‚Äôd never spent that $10k buying drugs and tiger costumes and knives and yeah) BUT it is better to have a safety net, especially if you think you might not wanna ‚Äúuse the stairs‚Äù.

I‚Äôve done some really bad stuff and struggle every day to find a reason why I deserve to breathe. But if I can do it, I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT! Sending you all the love and courage to seek help when you‚Äôre ready. 

I hope you find your way x"
u_Zeros_Jody,ffvsu4z,t1_ffh13b2,1580272256.0,"Agree! Quick question tho... WHY does reddit keep serving me keto diet advice even though I don‚Äôt follow threads? Also actively unfollowed all of them (they make me feel fat and sad... and sometimes also hungry which often leads to emotional eating - vicious, vicious cycle that one). And NO I do not google anything diet related nor recipes etc so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs to do w my analytics...

And yet I still clicked on this post so yah, well done Judy!"
juul,fcowt2i,t1_fco5u6w,1577843732.0,"Congrats dude! Fully support this advice. And yeah, nicotine isn‚Äôt heroin BUT they don‚Äôt sell H at your local gas station, and vaping/smoking is more socially accepted which makes it even harder as well. I have quit doing H and other hard drugs, but for me the hardest challenge will be coming off ciggies for sure. Big ups to you"
juul,fcis7tj,t1_fccntgr,1577668572.0,"I think it‚Äôs also the way the nicotine is delivered - isn‚Äôt it nicotine salts or something? Also, the tobacco flavour tastes quite similar to my regular brand (I smoke rollies). After smoking pretty heavily for almost twenty years, the fact that I smoked only ONE small roll-up yesterday without feeling like crap is proof enough for me that the juul could be an awesome alternative ü§ûü§ò‚úåÔ∏è"
juul,fcc5tbb,t3_egzrz9,1577594743.0,Lol I ordered my first juul while watching this doco. First vape that‚Äôs actually felt comparable (and even preferable) to regular cigs.
