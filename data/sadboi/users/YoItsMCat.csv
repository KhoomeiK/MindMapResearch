We are supposed to settle with a vague shot that might have been Christina holding her hand? Why not at least show Meredith calling her even if we don't get to see the other side?

 We don't at the minimum get some emotional scenes of people speaking at the service? I wasn't THAT mad he was dead (although I don't know why Grey's is so against a marriage happening off camera), it was how little respect his death got.
