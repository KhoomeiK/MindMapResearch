beatles,f842nos,t3_dybd9n,1574228516.0,"23, from the Philippines! I've been introduced to the world of The Beatles at an early age because my dad (currently 56 years old) was and is a huge fan. We always listen to their songs in our car, sing them on the karaoke. It's pretty intense. However, when I was younger, I'd always look at them as one of my dad's favorite bands. It wasn't until a few years ago (probably when I was 19) when I rediscovered them for myself, as a band that I love, and not as my dad's. I fell in love with every little bit of their music all over again and I was also lucky to have a roommate that's a fan of them, during my university days!

I can't really choose only ONE favorite album haha so here are a few tracks that I am really addicted to:

-Helter Skelter
-Eleanor Rigby
-Oh! Darling
-Rocky Racoon 
-Something
-I Saw Her Standing There (the bass line drives me insane)
-While My Guitar Gently Weeps
-Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
-Across The Universe
-I Want You
-Here, There and everywhere 
-Blackbird
-Till There Was You (I know it's only a cover but it's so good!!) 
-A Day In The Life
-In My Life
-I Will
-Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

I thought I might include here my dad's favorites:
Michelle
Yesterday
The Long And Winding Road
Obdi Oblada
Strawberry Fields Forever
Here Comes The Sun
Something
Can't Buy Me Love
Let It Be

My 18 year old brother is also a fan and his favorite Beatle is Paul McCharmly hahaha

The other music that I listen to is anything and everything from Kendrick Lamar (one of my faves from him is ADHD and I certainly love To Pimp a Butterfly) , and I also also love listening to classical music. One of my favorite pieces is Liszt's La Campanella. So yeah there you go!"

Daylio,f4091yf,t1_f3zr4i1,1571289411.0,"I'm not saying that they have an outright bias on platforms, it's just that based on my experience as an android user, my friends who are iphone users receive updates earlier than I do. I have nothing against the daylio dev because they have the best UI/UX out of all the trackers out there. All I'm saying is that most of the time, most apps roll out their updates on iOS which is fine. It's probably also a geographical case because I live in a developing nation so maybe this issue is more applicable to countries like mine."
Daylio,f408r37,t1_f408a0u,1571289069.0,I based my comments off on the first comment which said that they have the feature already. I'm an android user too and I just received the update a few hours ago while my friends who use iphones received it earlier than I did.
Daylio,f3zu3tf,t1_f3ztiab,1571277041.0,"Well it depends on the devs' release. Most apps prioritize iOS. I worked in a tech company before and since most of our app downloads are from iOS users, our devs prioritize the release of updates for ios"
Daylio,f3zmz9q,t3_dh5lx0,1571272711.0,"You're not alone, buddy!! That happens to me as well. Most of the time I just really can't force myself to identify specific activities related to the mood I selected, especially when my mood is crashing. I always feel guilty about it and I try so hard to update previous entries whenever my day is good."
Daylio,f3zlppw,t1_f3yl2wh,1571271914.0,I believe most companies prioritize the development of certain features and UI/UX improvement of their apps depending on their market. Daylio probably has a larger set of iOS users compared to android that's why new featurea roll out to iOS users first.

It certainly feels that I want to run away and flee, but for some reason, after I think of the things that make me hate this friend, I automatically think good things about our friendship. I just have this feeling within me that I want to protect myself, my mind, and my things from them because I'm afraid that this friend want them too. It's really so frustrating because I've never felt like this with any of my friends before."

mentalhealth,f25vc8p,t1_f25rxsl,1569984791.0,"Yeah it's like a proof that actual living is a burden because a lot of people, even those undiagnosed with mental health illnesses have so much potential but the problem is a) they have limited resources to fully reach their potential or b) there's always something hindering us which for our case, is our illness because it has its limits when it comes to determination. It's easy to stay alive but it's difficult to have a life."

SecularTarot,f247jc2,t3_czmz0q,1569946315.0,"I am als onew to tarot and I really use it for self reflection, as a therapeutic tool (kind of) for mental health purposes, and just to increase my level of self awareness and to promote self love to my friends who love to get tarot readings from me (I practice with them). Most of the time, you already know what you want to hear, you just can't say it to yourself; and that when the cards are really a huge help.

I currently only have two tarot decks, the RWS and The Wildwood Tarot. 

Starting tarot was honestly a long time coming for me. I spent so many months last year researching and researching if it would be benefitial for me. I was afraid that I might tackle with subjectivity the things that needed to be confronted objectively in my life; and that's when I started to just let any inhibitions go and buy myself a deck. I really couldn't believe that the cards would help me in learning more about myself both in a subjective and objective way which is something that I didn't expect!"
SecularTarot,f2472ud,t3_d04nhb,1569946076.0,"I just started tarot earlier this year so I'm still pretty new and I do learn a lot of things about the cards everyday, thanks to daily draws. But what I'm totally confused about is that I can't seem to connect with one suit which is the Suit of Pentacles. For whatever reason, whenever I pull a card from this suit, I always go blank whenever I read for myself or for my friends and it takes quite some time for me to rumamge through my thoughts and feelings about the particular card. It's probably because it's the area of my life that's lacking in conscious effort? Idk but that's what I guess it is."
SecularTarot,f244gbb,t3_d620ev,1569944694.0,"I use tarot for self awareness. Most of the time, when I feel confused about something and I have a question in mind, once I draw two cards, I know which card I'd more likely follow so it's like deep inside, I already know what I want to hear, it's just that I can't seem to say it out loud. For me, I don't think that tarot can help with predicting the future but it can help us in making informed decisions for the future, that's how I see it. I also love drawing daily cards with an actual deck and with an app (either with Golden Thread or Mystic Mondays app) and journal them, and check the stats of which specific card, or suit, number, do I usually get per month, fun things like that!"
SecularTarot,f243z7h,t3_da2xg5,1569944394.0,"Sometimes I read reversals and sometimes I don't, it really depends on the current mood haha. But whenever I do, I taek it in different ways like if I got an 8 of wands in reverse, for me sometimes it means that I have to focus on getting past the energy of the previous card and complete that energy, which is the 7 of wands so that I could be more open for the 8 of wands. Sometimes, I just take it as it is, or just in a more negative light like it's something that's lacking or something that's too much."

mentalhealth,f242di4,t3_dbu8yu,1569943341.0,"Hello! First of all I think you should let go of the fear of not knowing what to do once you move to a different country. Take small steps! You can worry about adjusting to the new environment and culture once you get there. Okay so, I guess if you want to move abroad you'd have to find sources for funds. Take the time that you need to save up for whatever you might need but I guess first you'll have to look for jobs in the country that you're interested to move in so that once you go there, you wouldn't depend on what you've saved and you won't have to worry if it's enough becuase you'll have a source of income. If you think that it's impossible to get a job there (after you try it), I guess the next option is to move to a different city or place that has the same ambiance or an atmosphere that is quite close to the characteristics of the country that you'd like to move in. Is it the architecture? The peaceful scenery? :)
