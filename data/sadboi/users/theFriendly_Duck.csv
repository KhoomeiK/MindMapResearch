egg_irl,fnokcqs,t3_g2w36j,1587127462.0,"Oof I was once shaving my leg for the first time and it wasn't working, so I pushed down on the razor, slicing skin off like a piece of cheese. Some advice for y'all kiddo's:

Use a fresh, sharp blade. I don't recommend using one razor more than 2/3 times.

You can use shaving cream, but also body soap or hair conditioner to make the blade glide more. I just shave with lots of water in the shower, as my skin is very sensitive to soaps.

When you shave, DON'T PUSH DOWN ON THE BLADE. Just let the blade glide over the skin with minimal pressure.

Rinse the blade after every stroke, especially if your hair is a bit long. Otherwise it gets clogged and doesn't work anymore, resulting in the pushing and cuts.

When shaving knees, stretch your leg as far as possible, and try to pull your skin a bit taut to avoid the blade catching and cutting. Slowly go over the joint, you might need a few passes.

If your skin is very sensitive, go with the growth direction. I do this on my upper legs as stubbles hurt so much in summer. It won't be as smooth, but less irritated.

Finally, moisturise after showering, with a body lotion or oil or some cream. This will help avoid your skin becoming too dry and itchy.

I hope this helps a little. Good luck!"

mentalhacks,fn6ixv1,t1_fn6dff2,1586700483.0,"This is basically how cognitive behaviour therapy works. You're asked to challenge the thoughts that give you anxiety, as a feeling almost always comes from a thought. It can be very hard, especially in the beginning, as some of these thoughts are automatic and go so quickly that you don't even realize you have them.

After a while of challenging these thoughts, the idea is that it becomes easier to not believe these thoughts, and therefore avoid the bad feeling. My therapist always put it like walking a path. After taking it often enough, the most travelled path gets carved out and is easier to follow, but sometimes the path is not helpful. So you have to carve another path. And the more you do it, the easier it becomes.

A real life example would be that if you have low self esteem, and you hear a group of people laugh, someone might think ""they must be laughing at me"". A more helpful and more likely thought is that they are simple having fun and joking together. By starting to recall this event at home or in some quiet time, using the table in the OP, hopefully after a while the more helpful thought becomes the default.

Sorry for the long-winded comment btw, but I hope this is helpful for someone!"
