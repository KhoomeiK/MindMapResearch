Buddhism,fozklxv,t1_foy1ine,1588192230.0,"True. The obsession with the fasting Buddha is so representative of our society's infatuation with the idea of self-denial and willpower being positive qualities over the ""evil"" of presumed laziness or self-indulgence. However, fastidious asceticism is just another type of desire, a competition to ""prove"" one's willpower/self-control to the self and others. The focus on self-denial is a distraction, not the journey to enlightenment.  


As someone in recovery from an eating disorder, I can attest trying to find ""the middle way"" in my relationship with food is much more difficult and complicated that one of asceticism (restricting/fasting/purging) or over-indulgence (binging). When I am starving and underweight, I am numbed from my feelings and always distracted from the present moment. This is a desirable effect when your present moment/feelings are uncomfortable or unbearable (avoidance of suffering). But then I am unable to learn how to sit with these feelings or learn how to observe and not suffer from them. A lot of therapy for eating disorders (CBT, DBT, etc) have a lot of parallels to Buddhist teachings."

EatingDisorderDump,fmwdhat,t3_fxtmfu,1586444579.0,"There's a few reasons.  


1. Exposure therapy. It is normal to eat and enjoy these types of foods once in awhile. ED treatment is one of the best places to do this because you have the support around you.
2. A variety of healthy and ""unhealthy"" food is served at these places. Many of these videos/documentaries focus on the ""unhealthy"" or exposure food given because of the drama it creates with the patients. This doesn't give an accurate picture of what is eaten day to day. For example, a typical day for me in inpatient might look like: mixed berries, fruit dip,  soy sausage, milk, cereal, and a muffin for breakfast, banana and nuts and granola bar for AM snack, lunch would be milk, sandwich, salad with dressing, PM snack might be a dessert with milk, dinner might be pasta with veggies and protein and creamy dressing, maybe fruit juice or milk, bedtime snack might be a poptart or yogurt and nuts or whatever.
3. Re-feeding when underweight or malnourished requires [a ridiculous number of calories. Often 3500-4000+ per day just to gain 1-2 pounds](https://www.scienceofeds.org/2014/05/07/hypermetabolism-in-anorexia-nervosa/) a week.  Add in the fact that your digestive system is impaired with a slow down in stomach emptying and atrophy of the smooth muscles in the intestine. This leads to feelings of fullness and bloating, constipation, and even severe pain stomach pain with small amounts of food. You can see why it's nearly impossible to get in the adequate number of calories per day on so-called ""healthy"" foods which are high in fiber and lower in calories via mass.
4. Remember that the meal plans and food are all created by registered dieticians and overseen by physicians, who have years of experience and education in how the body actually utilizes macro and micronutrients. Supplements and vitamins are taken as well to restore the body's supply. ""Nutritionists"" and other wellness coaches who create their own ""healthy"" meal plans don't have any regulated training, licensing, or testing like registered dieticians do."

weightgain,fmir47b,t3_fv5uqw,1586115219.0,"So when your body is recovering from starvation, it takes boatloads more calories to gain weight. [Here's a really good article](https://www.scienceofeds.org/2014/05/07/hypermetabolism-in-anorexia-nervosa/) to explain the science behind it. Additionally, being underweight for that long of a period of time means your stomach has physically atrophied, meaning it fills up faster, it's painful, and takes longer to empty. Putting on weight when you're underweight is HARD. it's uncomfortable, and you usually have to eat to the point of feeling bloated/nauseated multiple times a day. I HIGHLY recommend you seek the advice of a registered dietitian. Phone or telehealth appointments should still be available right now. Seeking one with a history of treating people with eating disorders would be good, just because they are used to dealing with the refeeding symptoms you will experience and have more knowledge/tricks to help you through.

mentalillness,flxgjpt,t3_frpg8x,1585582465.0,"It's caused by hyperventilating (breathing fast). When you hyperventilate, the CO2 levels in your blood go down. Since CO2 is an acid, the pH of your blood goes up, causing a condition called respiratory alkalosis. The alkaline blood makes you feel dizzy, lightheaded, and gives the tingling sensation in your fingers and sometimes larger muscles as well. It's not dangerous, and it will quickly correct itself. That's why some people feel breathing into a paper bag helps, because you're rebreathing in exhaled CO2. If you notice your fingers are tingling, focus on deep breathing techniques such as square breathing. Close your eyes and inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, then let the breath out through your mouth for 4 seconds, and repeat."
