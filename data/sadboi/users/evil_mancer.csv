That they have to give up their intrests that they have to spend every second at work, they are not allowed to have any control in their homelife. The funny thing is that I've never even had physical sex. What really killed it is that you must never complain about how shitty your life is and you must never talk about your negative emotions, because nobody fucking cares. You are expected to work, sacrifice and care about everyone else with nothing in return but occasional sex. 

I'd rather be alone."

Everything was about control with her, and she was only happy when she controlled every action I made. She was neglectful, unless she could use something against you as why you where selfish, like doing laundry or cooking. She would use any information you told her as Ammunition to criticize you later and would shut you down if you got angry at her. Her anxiety to not be the bad guy, damaged me for a decade, forcing me to thing everything was my fault. 

Me and my sister have had no luck if finding a significant other, and I have never had a girlfriend. I don't think I will ever be able to trust anyone ever. Maybe it's genetic, my father is reserved and both my parents had issues with neglect.

Say everything you could possibly say, over and over, until the mirror has heard everything single minute detail that it could hear. Once you have completely and utterly cured yourself of depression through self reflection then I want you to come back to me. Otherwise, help is non material and meaningless talking, purely for the benefit of the helper. If that was the case then help is just so other people don't have to feel bad seeing you suffer or its a business that you profit off of and why do something silly like cure someone and lose your revenue source. I would hate to live in that world."
unpopularopinion,fq4nqip,t1_fq45zhf,1589080082.0,"> alone, people will believe you and leave you alone. So is that really what you want?

I have found that anyone that wants online, can only do so much for you, since all it is talk. People in are less helpful because they usually only talk to you once before leaving forever. Maybe its different in other countries or cities, but I found at a certain point, when a person saw me in distress the outcome was the same no matter what I said. If I said I was not ok, they would just want to talk about it and at best offer is to be hopeful. If I said I was fine, they would just leave me alone. The result is the same, it just one didn't waste my time. Since motivational stuff never worked on me and I have failed at 99% of everything I have every done, why bother. Help has never be given to me and help that I have paid for has never worked. From my experience, there is no help. Sure I could go back to a doctor, I could go to a support group, but nothing would change. I will always continue not to feel anything, I will never enjoy anything outside of a handful of my own self intrests, and I will never be allowed to work a single second less. 

Fine, If you are able to help me, do something. I have begged on this website for more than a year for someone to anything that can change my life. I have had exactly one person in my entire miserable life who felt bad for me and tried to help. Every party he invited me to I felt like an like shit. After about a year, he moved and that was the last time I had anyone I could ever see within walking distance. He tried to reconnect years later, but my anxiety and work schedule didn't allow it. Now I'm sure he wants nothing to do with me, because of how depressed I am. I have been alone my entire adult life, every friend has always been a minimum 30 minutes away, usually an hour. I have an awful relationship with my family. I had no one I could really talk to about my problems, and it took me 14 years to realize that no one cared. 

I honestly think I am a psychopath, that I cannot feel love or joy. I've rationalized if differently over the years; that it will come eventually, that its fair that I suffer so much to those that don't, that it my fault. Some much of my miserable life has been me wishing someone would help me, then the time I was able to take the steps my self brought me nothing but misery. 

I honesty don't know what you could do for me that I or someone else hasn't already tried. I'm sure you already have ""Well if that's how you feel"", response ready to type up."
