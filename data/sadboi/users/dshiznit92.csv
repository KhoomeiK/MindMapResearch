hempflowers,fmycctn,t1_fmwo17b,1586482890.0,"I am not very good at keeping track of my dosage or usage with the cbd. I usually save it for night, sometimes a blunt, sometimes half a joint, sometimes a whole day of ripping ye olde cartridge haha. But yeah I’m still on the seroquel, 50mg each night, and I hate the way it makes me feel. I know it’s a low dose but I hate that it makes me sleep in so late no matter what time I go to sleep (I’ve always been a night owl that could still wake up early), I hate that I feel trapped in my own thoughts and still unable to properly express my feelings. I’m grateful I’m not doing wild shit anymore like coke from a stranger in a bathroom or running up all my credit cards and not paying the bill, but it’s certainly come with a different cost. The cbd has helped calm down the intrusive thoughts and the pent up feelings that come from being bipolar and on a medication that makes you keep it all in. 

I know your struggle, bipolar makes every fucking day a challenge. You don’t know whether to enjoy being happy or you should worry that you’re about to be manic. You lash out at people you love and watch them hurt but you can’t stop it from happening. But there’s a lot of beauty in it too. We are people that are capable of loving intensely despite fighting our own brains constantly, when we’re manic we can feel and experience things on incredible levels, and even with all the troubles not only in the world but in our own brains we keep going every day. I feel for you friend, I know you wish you could go back and just realize it sooner, but now that you know the why, it’s all about how you use it to make life better instead of letting it continue to make things worse. Keep your head up and if you ever need to vent out some shit you can drop a line."
