I was an extremely overweight kid in school.   Athletics was the worst period of the day because of the incessant bullying that came from the clique of cnuts that the kids were then(some still even but w.e) 
 
Our athletics teacher/coach was pretty awesome.  She worked as the aide to the special needs group of kids too. She was fluent in ASL and had a cochlear implant studded with rhinestones of the school colours.  She was upbeat and fun and usually was only “tough love” on her kids that were in legit sports. I wasn’t in any sports minus a couple track things like discus and shotput.  

There was a day the class was made to run laps around the bball court, suicides, and net jumps —- I was at the back of the group and was lapped each exercise dozens over.  I had no stamina and my back problems were peak at that weight which honestly wasn’t anything new to anyone in the class.  

I was crying and barely able to breathe so I asked to take a short break to catch my breath and get a sip of water—

The teacher yelled at me to sit the hell down and get my pathetic self together—Then as I started crying harder began to tell me I was worthless and how I needed to leave the school because not a single kid or teacher liked or wanted me there because I was so damn pathetic etc etc

I black out what other specifics happened —

After my Mom went momma bear on my superintendent- teacher was made to apologize to me.   Apparently her father had just passed and been buried and she was dealing with a lot. Shortly thereafter I was taking from athletics all over because bullying never stopped."

Especially if your state passed a law on straws (I’m in Texas so that’s unfortunately not a thing yet) she would’ve been clued in on it in training. The way the manager pulled her from the table makes me think either 1. It was “the last straw”(heh) to her not following server instructions.  Or 2. The manager sensed your party could’ve more trouble for her she could handle(possibly her being new) and have your table to a more experienced server.  

I highly doubt she was fired ? But I’m not sure what restaurant it was or what ordinance it has on rule breaking. She could’ve been told to go home for the evening to study her rules more? Or she was in retraining while you didn’t see her.   

Also as a waitress- it’s totally annoying when people with headphones/earbuds try to tell you something and they end up yelling.  As an avid music lover I get it and wouldn’t have taken it personally but.  Point of the matter is you could’ve slid off a side to say your peace.

Why do you assume she’s obligated to be around ? Why do you assume there’s no reason ? Surely she feels love for this baby, seeing as babies are ignorant to the evil of the world, but IME something traumatic has happened between her and the family ((or  maybe just to her that she’s not confident about sharing)) to put her in the mindset to avoid get togethers.

AmItheAsshole,f8c3om8,t3_e02ubm,1574451706.0,"As a snake owner (I have an 8 year old kingsnake), Your sisters behavior disgusts me. It gives snake parents a bad name, and we already face enough criticism as is.   I couldn’t imagine ever asking anyone for their passed on pet for food for my scalebaby.  No matter how broke I was and how far I’d have to go to the nearest store that had her frozen mice.   
It’s one thing if they offered it to her, and even then I know my empathic self would feel shitty for it.  But you clearly were not offering and it’s very much not okay for her to have asked. As for your parents behavior it’s sickening as well.  If I were you I would never honestly own another pet again that’s of size able to feed to the snake for as long as you live in the household with them.  I’m so sorry you have to go through this while grieving but you are 100% NTA for being upset at their out-of-line attitudes"

Adult diapers have not leaked on me but twice in the two years I’ve used them.   And when I can be at home I typically just wear them and freebleed so I get over it quicker with less pain"
FallOutBoy,f82ucc7,t1_f82u525,1574198376.0,By his Holiness I mean Pete - were you worried I meant “God”?

FallOutBoy,f82tob8,t1_f82tjte,1574198002.0,Nah Pete is a trusting guy
FallOutBoy,f82onn0,t1_f82jz2d,1574195259.0,My guess is  whoever left their other flip flop on the floor left it in the care of Pete  to run to the store for more butter for them all to share

AnimalsBeingBros,f8239bu,t1_f822lqt,1574183043.0,"And this is why I went on my “”hurr hurr human bad “” tirade.  Humans fucking suck.  We can rarely just let something be wild without destroying everything it lives in and then freak out if it manages to get back to what we now know as our territory.   When a handful of humans that have better souls do a bit of good for animal kind — there’s a hundred thousand others doing everything they can (or unknowingly through consumerism) to destroy the efforts. 
Humans suck. 
Don’t breed."
FallOutBoy,f822mr7,t1_f821weo,1574182663.0,I don’t care though.  Calling him a phony for what ?  Seems just fucking rude.
videos,f822kea,t1_f821emk,1574182623.0,"There are precautions. Limiting who can see what you post in your settings is typically first step.  Still. These people can be way more tech savvy and smart than anything Facebook can prevent.  But You’re right.  Personally if I had the misfortune of a child - I would steady be strapped up.  Shooting the tires out or marking the car up with bullet holes could’ve bought her extra time to attempt rescuing her daughter.   But again.  The people that want to do these horrible things tend to know no bounds - and there’s nothing short of total world annihilation that can stop every possible happening.  
Humans suck.  Don’t breed."

It’s just cute 
Hella cute

His holiness knows no bounds of this “cute”"

FallOutBoy,f81wmv9,t1_f81vvp8,1574178970.0,I have a schlew of 07 pictures (including the inside artwork of my IOH vinyl) that tells me otherwise.  you’re just a salty sally you don’t look as punk rock as he does doing it.
AnimalsBeingBros,f81w6kl,t1_f81vxlk,1574178685.0,"Believe what you want but there’s plenty of subReddit that will tell you humans are shit.   Wild animals are literally just living their lives and most humans tend to fall into the negative interaction side.  You asked why they’re misunderstood-
They’re wild 
Humans aren’t 
Humans are the APEX over all. 
Therefore - humans are shit.  Good day."
AnimalsBeingBros,f81ugeq,t1_f81s7o6,1574177604.0,She makes it feel so right—
AnimalsBeingBros,f81u512,t1_f81tiu3,1574177401.0,"Well.  Like most wild animals living their naturally wild life - when humans encroach on territory and provide easier accessible prey- they’ll get shot or hunted for doing what a wild animal does.   
They’re wild animals.  Humans live in their space and then get mad when they want to come back to parts they used to be able to be in unburdened.  Humans that don’t properly secure and use preventative measures for animals they own get (or don’t but they want to hunt the animals anyhow) have seriously dwindled and reduced the numbers of these beauties and it’s fucking bullshit.  
Trophy hunting is bullshit. 
And killing any wild animals because they curiously wander into your yard and messed up plants or took a chicken from an unsecured coop is even more major bullshit. 

They’re misunderstood because a lot of humans see them (and other wild animals ) as threats.  When in reality humans are the biggest plague on this beautiful globe.  Instead of living together and finding harmony, humans are leeches and take more than it could ever provide.  I’m happy my gene pool will die with me."
