 Also all food should be packaged the way McDonalds give dashers  your food. In a bag wrapped up and put in another bag with tape sealing the bag close. So you know it hasn't be touched.

I also think there should be a locked in starting tip. If you order $10 worth of food then you can't tip below $5, for example. You can give a higher tip but not a lower tip."

freebies,fly2h0r,t1_flxwp2u,1585594319.0,"From my experience it's causes less issues if you have it in paper. Your wife wouldn't have to go to court unless your family member thinks she shouldn't be POA or you were forced to give her POS, or she neglects her responsibilities to you. For example let's say you have medical issues like dementia or Alzheimer's, you need someone to handle your finances and help with day to day things. The money you get from social security would be used for you and your needs plus any money you might get from the government should go into your care. So your medical care, house payments/rent, house improvements for your medical issues, car payments unless you use a insurance approved ride service, clothes, food etc. So if the money isn't used for basic care and keeping a roof over your head then your family member can go to court have to Power of Attorney examined and changed if need be. Or the can have a state appointed person to be POA. Anyone over the age of 18 can be your POA. 

I know from experience this has happened in my family twice. My grandmother has dementia and her daughter has POA but currently in the process of getting it changed. She wouldn't hire a live in nurse so help take care of her mother and even kept letting her drive even though the doctor said she can't anymore plus she was getting into care accidents. Somehow she let her mother's house go into debt even though it was payed off many years ago. So now she lives in assisted living location.

Other time was with my aunt who passed from pancreatic cancer almost 3 years ago. That was terrible, people fighting over items.

I would encourage you have it written out who will be POA if something happens to you where you need to be taken care or pass away. If you want your wife to be POA then talk to her about it and see how see feels. She might not mind or she might want someone ya both trust to handle that. It's a lot of to deal with.

 My friend got married a couple years ago and they both have a little girl together, she didn't want to be her husband's POA she would rather their daughter have it but she's only temporary POA till their daughter is 18 then it transfers to her. 

Hope this helps you a little. Congrats on getting married! Hope this virus isn't dampening your newlywed bless."

freebies,fhsnbhk,t1_fhsg707,1581862998.0,"I tell them to their face why they aren't getting a tip. I use to work in the food service industry. So I understand what's going on. Food can be backed up in the kitchen, middle of a rush hour, first day, bad day, just dropped a bunch a food yourself, not enough workers, terrible boss or co workers.

 I get it I really do but I don't expect a sever to snap at me, people in with, or any kids I'm with. I don't think I have to wait 30 minutes for a high chair. I shouldn't have to chase my sever down in order to get my drinks (the sever that time was making out with another sever). I shouldn't have a sever get upset if I asked if this food has no milk in it because I have a child who has a milk allergy with me and the other one is lactose intolerant. I shouldn't get back talk, eye rolling, or disrespect from my sever.

I usually come in a big group 4 children and another adult at the most or at least 2 children by myself. I do daycare work so I like to take the kids out to eat. Let them get some fresh air and some good food plus I don't have to wash dishes. I always tip the exact amount I spend. So if I spend $20 I'll give the sever $20 unless there is a bus boy cleaning off the table then I give each person $10 each. So if the sever doesn't do right then they aren't getting anything from me only the table cleaner (bus boy). To me a tip represents your how well you did . If the service from the sever is good that will be reflected in the tip. 

Also try tip your bus boys. Sometimes they get payed worse then servers. I remember I went to this diner with my big group of 4 kids plus 1 adult. We were done eating and they went to the car while I stayed to pay for the meal. I left a $20 for the server then here comes a girl who wasn't the sever cleaning the table. So I pulled out a $20 and gave it to her. She was surprised and didn't take it at first, till I stuffed it in her pocket in her apron and said it was a tip. This poor girl started to cry, the severs there decide how much their table cleaners (bus boys) get from their tips. So if the sever thinks they get $3 dollars in from their tips then that's all they get the manager doesn't care. I felt bad so I gave her a $10 too and told her about Grandma's kitchen ( a small local restaurant) that was hiring were she would make more then working at that diner."

disneymagickingdoms,fff8qe1,t3_et3vc5,1579878511.0,"The worst attraction for me is the one from Incredibles. It's the big machine attacking the city attraction, its super huge and takes up a whole plot. I have to keep it in storage because of the size. I wish each collection had its own land, would make it easier to place buildings. Space is always a issue and will continue to be a issue.

 It was a big issue for Avengers Academy, the developers kept promising land because of all the buildings from events but it never came (plus they promised dating but that's a different story). Now the game has been shut down. 

I think this a big problem with games like these, not enough space aka land. They need to slow down the events and produce land or maybe balance out the land with the amount of characters currently in the game. Maybe they could give land for each collection that comes with a events. Like they did star wars, 15% more magic when buildings from the collection are place in the collections land."
disneymagickingdoms,fff73rx,t3_etb44j,1579877387.0,I have a different idea. A premium character in a collection will be able to produce the relics for that collection. So for example Pluto is a premium character so it will be able to do a task to get relics for that collection. Rex from Toy Story is another example where it will have task to produce relics. Then there will a building where it can produce blueprints. When you first get the building it can drop park relics then the 1st enchantment it can drop common blueprints then 2nd enchantment it can drop uncommon blueprints and so on so forth.

disneymagickingdoms,fcq1anw,t1_fckzhs6,1577876578.0,What are those fabric for?
disneymagickingdoms,fcq0uuz,t1_fcmqxci,1577876323.0,So very true. Especially premium character should be about to collect relics. Regret buying Davy Jones but if could drop relics game changer.
disneymagickingdoms,fcq0bkc,t3_ei3xn7,1577876006.0,I know how you feel. I unlocked C3PO the same day I got Poe. Took forever for the ear token to drop. Then it took me the day before I got Hux to level him up to level 2. Drop rates needs to me fixed.
