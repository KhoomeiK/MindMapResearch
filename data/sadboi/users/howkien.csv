I don't have budget for Cintiq, so I'm trying to choose between One Medium, Intuos Bluetooth Small or Medium or Intuos Pro Small or Medium. I'm an animation student and do illustration freelance jobs and commissions, but I am quite used to the smaller working area of my Bamboo. So it's mostly the money thing for me. I'm thinking I can afford Intuos with pretty much no regrets but wondering if I should invest in Pro? What do you think? Which one should I get?"

The random shutdowns and weird battery draining, which i fixed for a few months with reflashing, are what did it to me though. I got J1 just to stay in contact with my family, but if the phone shuts down in the middle of the day, then even that basic task gets impossible. The one thing i don't like with Poco is it's size, but it seems like most phones are like that nowaday, i'll have to get used to it."
