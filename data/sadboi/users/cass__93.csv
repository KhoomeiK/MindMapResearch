Hey everyone! I was super excited to see this today!

&#x200B;

1. Stats: Female, 26, 4'10"". 98lbs
2. Goal: What is your goal for this month? Freestanding Handstand for 10 seconds
3. Current Progression: What progression or level are you at? Walking towards chest to wall.
4. What will you be working on? Getting closer to the wall, balancing drills, shoulder strength
5. Got a question? I have a plate on my left collarbone, where my left arm is about 1/2 an inch shorter than my right. My right shoulder is definitely stronger than my left - will this cause issues when training?

Aerials,foudfia,t1_forazyv,1588081914.0,"When using the X-pole frame, how much does it shake during use? Would it shake more/less based on the apparatus used? I typically do silks and hammock but I have read about it shaking and it makes me nervous, although people have said it's something to get used to on freestanding rigs. Do larger rigs such as the Ludwig shake as well?"
Aerials,f8md9q6,t3_e12f6y,1574630281.0,"After almost a whole year of being off silks due to a collarbone injury, I am back! Although there was a ton of strength and stamina lost, I am determined to get back to where I was. 

My goal is to bring the routine to life that I wrote while I was away."
Aerials,f7wu4un,t1_f7wt8ms,1574038127.0,"I’m planning on doing that, as well as contacting a rigger"
Aerials,f7w2tmq,t3_dxrpt8,1574029310.0,"Hi there, 

I was thinking about installing silks/single point hammock in my house from a ceiling hook. I see some complete set ups from aerial essentials, but  I was wondering how I determine the length of fabric needed?"
Hobbies,f1my0qn,t1_f1ktyo5,1569604625.0,"Hey there! You mentioned a gym membership - maybe look into aerial arts such as silks/hammock/Lyra?  I know it’s not for everybody but it honestly saved me. 

I suffer from depression and for a long time lacked motivation to do many things including finding a hobby. I eventually convinced myself to go and found it a very good fit. The classes in my studio are small (about 5-6 people) so there was not a big social obligation and everyone supports each other. 

As for the hobby itself, it’s challenging and fun, and something different than anything else I had really tried before and felt more motivated to go to classes rather than go to a gym where all of the activity and choices were overwhelming. 

I hope you can find something you love and I wish you all of the best!"

Hobbies,ezesyin,t3_d0q0od,1567868410.0,"Recovering from a collarbone fracture so I can understand how you're feeling! Going from extremely active to not at all can take a big toll. 

Have you tried any coloring books? I know you mentioned painting - there are some cool tutorials on youtube for watercolors/pastels etc. Other than that, crocheting, rock painting, reading, scrap-booking, cross stitching, learning a new language. Maybe pick up a kalimba (thumb piano) - they are pretty fun and relaxing to play around with.

Meditation is an option. Or you can take this time to learn about something that you've always wanted to learn but didn't have the time to before?

If you figure skate, could you possibly write routines or anything while you wait to go back? 

Best of luck on your healing!"
CasualConversation,ey0wget,t3_cuzi4w,1566684667.0,"I’ve had a few internet friends, I’ve met them through different sites/games. I met a majority of them when I was a teenager (25 now). With a few of them the friendships lasted a while but eventually tapered off.  Some of them are gone, others we just follow on social media, others it’s a once a month hi how are you. I’m going to guess it’s just because life is so busy. 

Do you play any games? That could be a good way to find friends by talking to people in chat. Other than that, finding people with common interests on reddit boards could be an option. I guess it’s just about finding someone that you click with.

Aerials,ew7cgvo,t1_enpwccv,1565189661.0,"Totally thought I replied to this forever ago but I was looking back and saw that I didn't.

I broke it while I was doing aerial silks. I was about 4-5ft in the air and I rolled out of a hip key and landed right on my left shoulder.

I actually found out last month that it hadn't really healed correctly so I just had it plated 3 weeks ago."
depression,ew7a9xx,t3_cmxltz,1565188663.0,"I'm really disheartened about the lack of sensitivity in some practitioners. I had a psychiatrist tell me that ""I should know more about (my) depression and how to deal with it since I study psychology""."
depression,eus3mzo,t3_ch5k91,1564002803.0,"This is so accurate. I’ve been dealing with depression for over 10 years despite numerous meds and therapists. I don’t know how to fight it. I’m told that it’s hard to be around me when I’m depressed constantly but I don’t know how to be anything else. In regards to reaching out, It puts me in a ‘damned if I do, damned if I don’t’ mentality."
brokenbones,epokl22,t1_epojoqu,1559346252.0,"Thank you for your comment. My first doctor also had me confused because he sent me back to work full time without restrictions about 2.5 months after the break despite not putting me in PT (I had to call and ask for it). I work as an ABA therapist with autistic children where I have to lift kids and handle aggressive behaviors. But then he told me “not to go lift any weights or anything” or not to to anything strenuous). I don’t know if I’m being hyper critical but some things just didn’t make sense to me. 

I should get the CT results by Monday so I should know then what’s really going on. Thank you again!"
