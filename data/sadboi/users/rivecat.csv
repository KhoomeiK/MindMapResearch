I get something from a dermatologist about darkness around my neck and he asks me if my family has a history of diabetes (I have no family history). I got my blood work done just over a year ago with no issue, and now today I'm am frantically waiting to hear back about test results I begged my physician to send over.


Of course these two things run my mind in every direction. I fear any symptom I see online. I'm thirsty for a third bottle of water that day? Diabetes. It's bullshit and I'm done.

Now your temperature is higher than normal, I'd call and ask a physician or someone how you feel, and let them know your circumstances. They'll probably say wait it out (depending on where you are), and that may be the best course of action for you.

You're going to be alright. It's a crazy time and being worried is totally justified, take a step back from the train of craziness and relax.
