It‚Äôs crazy unpredictable sometimes and that makes it fun imho. Started out with three stranded humans, ended up with no humans and a pack of 10 yorkies."

popping,fpsdn23,t3_gf066m,1588871700.0,"Two things, first: Holy crap! Had to watch it a few times.

Second of all: this reminds me of the The Grumps 10 Minute Power Hour where Arin has one of those things holding his mouth open and they keep shoving candies into his mouth while he screams MORE.

That being said, I WANT MORE."

popping,fl5mc1t,t1_fl2jved,1584840185.0,"I can attest to this. About a month before my tom cat passed away, my mom noticed a big bloody gaping hole on my cat‚Äôs butt. Apparently anal gland got impacted and exploded. The reason we didn‚Äôt know for so long is because his fur was so thick and dark, and he didn‚Äôt act like he was in pain or have any discomfort when we would pet him. 

Damn I miss him. He was a good boy."
