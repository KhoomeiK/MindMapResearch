YourGirlGang,fpforov,t1_fpfmd3g,1588578109.0,"Yeah Sydney is quite expensive for housing. We're on the very edge of Sydney, and it's kind of a cheap pocket area, because then we've got fancy colonial type houses after that. 

Id love to visit in the winter, I think snow is magical. I did visit Queenstown once many moons ago, got to sit in an open roof hot tub with snow falling. Gosh it was amazing, but again, Queenstown is so pricey for everything. Auckland is at the top of our list at the moment, we are wine and seafood fiends for sure. I've heard a lot of great things about other parts of South Island though. 

Water color I find is easy to work with because the colors are easier to dilute. I have trouble working with the opacity of oils."
YourGirlGang,fpfk5pb,t1_fpfewae,1588573752.0,"Haha I love 'the West Island', never heard that one before. 

Weather is getting cooler, and it's so lovely to go for an arvo walk at about 430. Windy as, but the mind actually got all of the leaves in our yard into one corner. 

I wonder if cities in NZ are quite as spread out as Sydney. An hour commute is normal for people in this city? 

What part of NZ are you from? It's on our travel list, we're just gathering ideas at the moment. 

I love Bob Ross, but I have so much trouble with oils or acrylics. I could probably only get as far as an acrylic pour. When I do my sketches, I usually go over them in fineliner, then a bit of water colour over the top. Haven't done it in a while but they usually turn out pretty well."
