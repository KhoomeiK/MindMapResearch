Accutane,fornmk6,t3_g96i61,1588015288.0,"Are you still on the drug? If not, then you should maybe talk to your doctor. If you're still going however, it is completely normal to break out randomly if the spots are small I guess 🤷🏼‍♀️"
acne,foisxc3,t3_g7k7uj,1587795967.0,Mine looks like this! I'm on accutane currently.
Accutane,fofvso0,t1_fofu27t,1587743694.0,"Ironically enough, I'm perfectly healthy even on this drug (maybe apart from a few mental thingies). She told me that the dry skin and all will get worse on a higher dose, so I guess that's what she meant by that. I'm also thinking about just switching derms at this point tbh as there's so many people going on high doses such as 60mg on this sub and they're about my weight."
Accutane,fofi16v,t1_fofe7ho,1587736325.0,"Sadly this isn't my last month lol. I'll be on it for a whole year in fact (7 more months to go, woo). Also, dryness started after 1-2 months for me! I sure hope my/our results will be as great as hers in the end."

BPD,fn7420d,t3_fzwrh9,1586712882.0,"This is probably the most relatable subreddit for me :,D I'd never want to be in any relationships with any of the people I got to fall for me. I'm not attracted to them and I don't really care as horrible as this sounds, but I just want some positive attention despite already being with somebody. However this once got me into a shitty situation where the guy just took advantage of me so be careful."
Accutane,fmvg73j,t1_fmull8g,1586415860.0,sadly it's the only way i can stay on it. besides i'm taking it for 12 months in total so who knows! (also i'm like 5'7 and i weigh abt 111lbs so maybe low dose is more effective if you're not too heavy...idk)
Accutane,fmkhtp1,t1_fmilblx,1586155435.0,"thank you so much and good luck for your ""journey"" as well!! 💕"
Accutane,fmkhk4o,t1_fmipnne,1586155182.0,i've asked them twice and both times they said that even 30mg(!!!) would be too high for me as i'm underweight. besides the side effects would get too intense for me to handle🙄
Accutane,fmkhfjo,t1_fmiqb5j,1586155058.0,i'm glad you're doing better now ❤
Accutane,fmkhbz2,t1_fmipyaw,1586154964.0,"i mean i'm 17, so i guess they're trying to be extra careful or smth... but i'm glad it worked so well for you!!❤"
Accutane,fmkh7om,t1_fmimyl2,1586154851.0,i'll try to remember that! so far i haven't experienced any accutane-related depression (surprisingly) though :) only strange mood swings that cause me to snap at someone and then cry over it afterwards haha
Accutane,fmkgpkq,t1_fmjkiv3,1586154365.0,i meant my derm only prescribed me 20mgs of accutane cuz i got a history of mental illness. they want to be extra sure. so far it didn't affect me emotionally though :)
Accutane,fmiksyt,t3_fvbee8,1586111565.0,"oh yeah, please don't mind the botched eyebrow in the top right corner, that was an accident 😅"
Accutane,fmikp18,t1_fmi2sbm,1586111501.0,so it did affect your psyche in the end?? tbh i'm thinking about just switching derms (once it's possible again) and requesting a higher dose but i'm worried of relapsing or smth :(
Accutane,fmikhn8,t1_fmidycy,1586111383.0,"my derm wants me to stay on it for a year probably, so i've got about 8 more months :/ ty tho<33"

Accutane,fmijnkd,t1_fmhrt0b,1586110904.0,thank you so much!! 💕 unfortunately my derm won't up my dose for now as i've had quite the history w/ suicidal thoughts/self harm in the past :(
Accutane,fmij9w0,t1_fmhjl8x,1586110688.0,"that's really giving me hope, thank you so much<3 i've been so worried i'd look like this forever since this hyperpigmentation or whatever has been there for months now 😭😭"

Accutane,fmh8bm8,t3_fv6gnx,1586070143.0,My derm said it will take up to 6 months post accutane until you can start working w the scars. Besides that it will probably fade fast once your course is over

BPD,flwmiwd,t3_frh2me,1585556383.0,"Idk if it has to do w/ bpd itself, but i feel you. In the past few years i had somewhat of an identity crisis triggered by lots of body dysmorphia and self hate. i'd go from extremely short hair to growing it out completely and i also changed my style each week (i was 15-16 at the time tho). ended up breaking down all the time because of it because i simply wasn't happy with who i was. now i can proudly say that i made it through that awful phase of my life and i know you will too. just remember that it doesn't matter what gender you will end up indentifying as- as long as you are at peace with yourself ❤"

Accutane,fky30g0,t1_fky279o,1584640416.0,ik it's hard but they aren't scars i promise!! it's just leftover shit from old breakouts which will fade away over time if u wear spf daily and moisturize a lot. we just need to have loooaaads of patience here

Accutane,fjclf5s,t1_fjcl5ym,1583225183.0,Tbh if your course is only 4 months it means you're on a higher dose than me (i'm only on 20mg) so you will definitely see results quicker in the upcoming months...i'm staying on the drug for a year probably

I don't think you're a hopeless case, shit I don't believe being a hopeless case on accutane is possible! It will definitely do its job sooner or later, but for now you have to push through.
