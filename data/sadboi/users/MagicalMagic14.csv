Devin Townsend's iteration of Crush and Propane Nightmares remix by Grabbitz are definitely the most loved ones. The Reworks also has it's hidden gems, such as an absolutely sick remix of Vault made by Moby, and ominous Noisia-like Streamline (ATTLAS Remix) - it has a simple, yet very creative drop, and sound design is definitely something on a Noisia level."

Mutiny was my pick for the last place, and now that it's out, a real challenge begins.
Now I can see two candidates I can vote out: The Other Side and 9,000 Miles. About TOS, it's a decent song, the modified vocals are OK I guess, the melody is really catchy. 9,000 Miles on the other hand, is better on a melodic aspect, but has almost no vocals, and compared to Midnight Runner, is quite repetitive. Probably gonna vote for TOS, not sure though."

In Silico will be more interesting because every single song in this album is great and it will be hard to pick a definite winner, although my prediction for the final round is Propane vs The Tempest.
As for The Reworks, we already know the winner, it's not a mystery that Propane remix by Grabbitz is the most liked one."

I mean it's still a good song, but imo not as good as Under the Waves, Encoder or Immunize. The thing is, people think that the most popular track of any band is certainly the best one, which is not the case.

Diamonds generate under high pressure and temperature, so it would make sense to have coal and diamond ores generated in biomes with high volcanic activity (specifically Wastes and Delta). For the coal ore it could just give you a piece of coal instantly, and a diamond one should give you something new - diamond shards, obtainable via ores or maybe bartering, and diamond horse armor could be smelted into a single shard to make obtaining diamonds just slightly easier. Of course, nine shards would give you a diamond. For an iron ore, I don't know. In which biome should it generate? Maybe we'll get a new specific biome for this purpose?"
