Also, look up homeless shelters, assistance places, etc. even if you’re renting a room or something there can be a lot of helpful resources"
askwomenadvice,fqzt4wj,t3_glg4pa,1589774752.0,"Sounds like she’s definitely been cheated on before or been in a super distrusting relationship before you got together. Try talking to her and letting her know calmly that you aren’t any of the people who have caused her that kind of pain, that you love her and understand why she may be feeling that way if she’s been cheated on before, ( if she has been cheated on before of course). Then let her know you want to be in a relationship where you can both trust each other. 

That, again, the girls are friends and have been important in your life as friends only, then ask her to look at it a different way, for example like what if you were asking her to stop talking to a good friend. 

If it makes her feel better and she doesn’t start asking all the time or snooping, go ahead and let her see the messages. It will put that little nagging feeling she has to rest for a while. I don’t recommend doing that all the time, but every few weeks or months if she’s feeling that way 

I was like this with my husband bc I was cheated on before we got together and I felt like such an asshole after accusing him, but I didn’t want to let my guard down because if he was cheating I’d feel stupid apologizing and there’s a lot of things to consider, the whole context and dynamic she’s trying to get across while protecting herself emotionally.  

He would let me see messages sometimes when I was feeling insecure, and I could see how it hurt him when I would ask. Then it really became pointless for me to ask bc I was 99% sure nothing would be there, and in return I wanted to stop hurting him with accusations. 

I’m not sure exactly what’s happening of course or how y’all’s relationship is, but I hope that helps in some way."
narcissisticparents,fqwv2j4,t1_fqwqtfh,1589718513.0,"I can relate, I tried telling SO many people what was happening at home (even called cps) and they either acted like it was bc my parents cared or I was dramatic, which in return made me feel crazy. 

Except, my best friend’s mom was so cool and smart and she helped me so much mentally, We would have deep talks, etc and I would tell her about my home life so she knew it all and saw it all and she was the *one* person who said, “Your parents are narcissists. I’m so sorry you have to go through this and if I could, I would let you live here.” 

The validation alone was immense."
narcissisticparents,fqwuaa2,t3_glda31,1589717815.0,"I feel like for the majority of people I know, that I get along with well, have experienced similar circumstances, but there’s a FEW that had a good upbringing or different from the, “norm” 

A lot of people I don’t get along with seem like they think things in life should be a certain way and people should act a certain way or something? Like They start disliking me when they see I’m quiet or timid or something I think, (which I have to get a little comfortable when around new people before I can be myself totally) and when I’m either

 1. Quiet bc I just met them or 

2. Trying to be myself and talk/joke I’ll get strange looks (even though I’m not saying anything outrageous lol.) 

I’m not sure why exactly it’s like this, I think it’s really a case by case basis, but just as a generalized opinion

Also like blakew965 said, people who haven’t experienced it have no clue the hell we all went through, a lot of people joke about narcissism mot understanding how detrimental it is to the people who’ve been children of narcs."
