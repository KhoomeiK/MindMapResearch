investing,fp0zrj9,t1_fp0oxse,1588220702.0,"A lot of people think it came from AA, but I read in a 1930’s book by Dale Carnegie called How to Win Friends and Influence People and it is also mentioned in his book How To Enjoy your Life and your Job, The quote goes something like this. “Close shut an iron door to the past and live life one day at a time, sure learn from the past and plan for the future but realize the only thing you can really control is the way you act and think today.” As far as mental health I’d seek some professional help if it gets to be too much. I’d recommend those two books if you want to gain a perspective on dealing with the Shittier parts of life. They’ve done a lot for me, and it’s really practical advice. Not like 99 percent of the garbage self help books out there."
