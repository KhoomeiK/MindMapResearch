iPhone11ProMax,f39d47y,t1_f39cyh8,1570746622.0,Have to wait and see. But I agree with reviews I’ve read. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is the best iPhone ever released. Has everything great in one package
iPhone11ProMax,f39cbf5,t1_f39c6li,1570746323.0,Battery is pretty massive in this thing. But if you don’t care about camera i would say wait.
iPhone11ProMax,f39c3i5,t1_f39bypy,1570746246.0,"Honestly, camera and battery Life."
iPhone11ProMax,f39bnd8,t3_df4yen,1570746085.0,I went from 8 plus to pro max. Couldn’t be happier.
AndroidQ,f2tg4km,t3_de351h,1570394492.0,This bothered me a bit too when I had my pixel 3. iPhone now. With iOS 13 is a nice black
hotornot,f1w8v83,t3_daxzo2,1569781772.0,Beautiful

essential,f0ulix4,t3_d6jb2x,1568943946.0,That’s unfortunate. The 3a has pretty much the best camera in the game. Well priced. I have an essential and I’m playing around with an iPhone X. What a difference.
BPD,f0syuv6,t3_d6esmt,1568912955.0,I lived this way my entire life. Recently is all boiled over and my entire life fell apart
essential,f0kt1bp,t3_d59n4p,1568687344.0,I'm finding battery life great. It's actually feeling better than my OnePlus 6T
essential,f08zolc,t1_f0881dx,1568491042.0,I just popped a non active chatr sim and BOOM there it was. Thanks for the tip.

OnePlus6t,eys8y16,t3_cyivvt,1567390592.0,I'm on the same beta and it's been good for me.
Koodo,eyoo0vx,t1_eyonxp5,1567280331.0,I actually just moved to Public Mobile LOL
android_beta,eyk2p8h,t1_eyk2oet,1567135092.0,Weird
android_beta,eyjji84,t1_eyj579d,1567120562.0,Go into settings and search adaptive notifications
android_beta,eyiuj8a,t3_cx4ibf,1567107826.0,I found turning off adaptive notifications fixes it. For me anyways.

Koodo,ey9gbo8,t1_ey9g97r,1566942702.0,I just upgraded to android 10 and now it's gone lol I think it's pretty unstable anyways right now
Koodo,ey8qt0i,t3_cw620h,1566926222.0,Reboot your phone and open messages. See what happens. That's what I did.
Koodo,ey8qn7n,t1_ey8qlcl,1566926117.0,Google. It shouldn't matter where it's purchased from. It's unlocked from Factory
Koodo,ey8m1fq,t3_cw620h,1566923142.0,Mine were disappearing too before. Now it's all there and says connected
android_beta,ey6wy69,t1_ey6rtwn,1566865831.0,I'm having a hard time with gestures.
android_beta,ey619np,t1_ey5x25f,1566845101.0,"Pixel 3xl. For some reason coming from the XS Max , gestures on the 3xl feel sloppy."
AndroidQ,extlxvt,t1_extj6x0,1566571027.0,I turned off adaptive notifications and things seems to be working well now.

PublicMobile,ew4ch82,t1_ew4cd1y,1565107677.0,I barely use 2gb
PublicMobile,ew496v2,t1_ew47r0v,1565105664.0,Would you say if I went $50 for the 8.5GB over my $75 12gb with Koodo it would be better for me?
PublicMobile,ew46vdg,t1_ew46odf,1565104177.0,How so?
PublicMobile,ew46h9l,t1_ew46d9t,1565103920.0,I’ve read if you turn off LTE on your phone you actually get faster 3G speeds.
PublicMobile,eunqu1y,t1_eunqkly,1563932301.0,Thanks I'll try my LTE does.
PublicMobile,eumhw1m,t3_cgy96d,1563915907.0,"I've had 0 issues with Public. If you switch , turn off LTE preferred on your phone and you will get much faster 3G speeds."

android_beta,es959ab,t3_c6juod,1561727639.0,Following this. I downgraded for this reason. Want to see if the gentle to prioritize fixes it.
PublicMobile,es955y3,t3_c6jxdy,1561727564.0,If you choose a plan with no data you can leave mobile data on and it will allow MMS to work however if you try using the web it will just direct you to a public mobile web page.
android_beta,erw784a,t3_c4dfz6,1561335187.0,Does everyone use the full gesture system?
android_beta,erw6ksx,t3_c4dfz6,1561334666.0,I haven't really noticed much of a difference in battery between 9 and Q beta 4 to be honest. Pixel 3 XL
android_beta,ersybmz,t3_c3kzot,1561227421.0,Looks like it has to be supported by your carrier also. I don't even have those options. Just says it's not supported by my carrier. Public Mobile in Canada.
PublicMobile,ern04k0,t3_c2vsiu,1561041505.0,So if I pay for the 6GB 4G LTE plan I'm only getting up to 3.5mbps?????
PublicMobile,eoj56id,t1_eoj4xco,1558633174.0,It’s obviously not suppppper fast but just fine for messaging and social media. Even YouTube and streaming Spotify
PublicMobile,eoiw7u0,t3_bs3acf,1558628573.0,If you turn off LTE on your phone it will get better 3G speeds. I’m consistently getting 11-20mbps. I’ve had many people test this. With LTE turned on its throttled but flipping to 3G only gets more true 3G speeds.
