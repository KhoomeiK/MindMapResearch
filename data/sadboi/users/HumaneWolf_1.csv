I'm sure your goals aren't to be in bed all day, even if you're experiencing a bad feeling and you're in the mood to do nothing - force yourself. For the things, you love to do (among other things, your goals).

Think about your goals, think about the future, think of the good life and achievements you can achieve.

 I can totally understand your feeling. It's really legitimate to have many concerns when a new part opens up in our lives, especially when it happens following a terrible global epidemic. I think what you need to do right now is to breathe and relax, have tea with a delicious, soft chocolate cookie and start thinking what interests you, what would you like to do in the future? I personally would go online and read a bit about the areas I connect with and love them and know I would like to engage in the future. I would start planning my goals and think about what I needed to do to achieve them.

For example I am now writing a comment to you because I am very connected to the field of psychology and I also work/volunteer in it.

I think on the bottom line you should consider going to a psychologist, you can tell him these situations you are experiencing and hear what he thinks about it. I think he will try to calm you down and maybe try to convince you that there is nothing wrong with you; We all have moments that we do not control ourselves which is perfectly legitimate.

In addition to this, he will also try to help you with a variety of treatment ways to reduce these ""tantrums"". You don't want or need to suffer anymore, and it's really not a shame to go to treatment and talk to someone."

I am sure you are a person with lots of talents and abilities, I can already say that you are very brave that you know how to share the feelings you are experiencing. So I already found you one very important ability, and I am sure you have many more of these capabilities that can help you with the job you choose.

Read a little on the internet about things that interest you, things you've always wanted to delve into, and you're very connected to.

Regardless of that, your friends are not going anywhere! There is a cellphone, there are ways of communicating and no one is gone after graduation.

I believe that life gives us challenges and we need to devour them and never give up on ourselves, even if it means we are suffering - we are not giving up because we have to win for ourselves!

I know how hard it is, I know how much it is possible to cry because it is difficult and to say to ourselves ""There is no way I will be a normal person like everyone else"", ""I hate myself.""

But with all the lack of faith in dealing with these situations, it is very important that you remember that there are people who still love you and care about you! Even if you don't think that way - other people do.

You shared something exciting, sad, and special here that you've experienced and it just proves to the hundreds of thousands of people who look at your post how strong and courageous a person you are.
