BipolarSOs,fomzypk,t3_g8cimj,1587908765.0,"I’m so sorry to hear of your situation.. I hope you both can work through it. My feeling is that she will eventually come around and you can both discuss how to move forward from this. Give her some time to reflect. That’s has been the case with me and my BPSO. He understands that I’m allowed to feel the way that I do. Considering this is a new-ish relationship, it will take time to figure out what works best for her during an episode, which to me it sounds like COVID may have triggered something. Being more self aware as a partner really helps your partner have their own self awareness as well. These are times of high stress and anxiety, so I feel for her.. btw, are you currently in a safe place?

Edit: I wanted to add that you both need to discuss more about her mental illness. If this is someone you want to be with for the rest of your life, you need to learn to navigate through these episodes and determine outlets or activities to do that help her get through it. Doing things like exercise, keeping a routine, and eating healthy helps to manage the symptoms. As well as therapy and medication. Learn how to talk with your SO as well. I can’t stress that enough.. those with bipolar feel emotions so much more than we do, so learning how to say something in a different way can really change the outcome of a conversation or a topic. and don’t be afraid of calling her out when she hurts you. Just because someone has bipolar disorder, they can’t use that as an excuse to say harmful things. Keep your chin up!!"

BipolarReddit,fnccf9v,t3_g0vnu0,1586833413.0,"I would try to find a new psychiatrist if you don’t have a good connection with them. Depending on your doc, they can fire you as a patient because you went against medical advice. And right now with the pandemic, it will be harder to find a new doc if they end up dropping you. Definitely let them know (if you haven’t already) that you took more than your normal dose. If you’re having a mixed episode, and you just recently started latuda, that’s probably what trigged the mixed episode. Latuda triggered it for my BPSO and he ended up taking 6 weeks off of work and then spent 2 more in the hospital. Stay safe, let me know if you have any questions or would like to vent. ❤️"

So you should both be able to do counseling while being long distance, and video chat with a therapist! We’ve been using it since August, and it’s allowed us to grow, communicate more effectively, and not let the BP control our lives. And it can also help by creating a relapse plan for you to both manage the BP. It’s a bit costly, but you can apply for their financial aid. The way I see it is if you really want to make this relationship work, the price shouldn’t matter."
BipolarSOs,f2xcqwi,t1_f2x9o87,1570476520.0,"I totally understand/agree with you that the mind can play tricks. I didn’t say everyone, but a majority of people aren’t educated. Like I said, it’s not just BP. 

Look, I just want to be clear, I’m not trying to downplay the illness or anything. Or saying that their feelings are invalid. I’ve gone through a lot with my BPSO. AS someone in the medical field, and things I’ve seen working in oncology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry.. there’s need to be a shift in educating your patients, educating yourself, and your loved ones. Going to your doctor when something arises, even if its a positive thing like feeling better from taking the medication. That’s why there’s continual follow ups, blood draws, and therapy appoints. I say loved ones because that’s an important factor. If you’re an SO that’s educated, then you will know what to do depending on the mood. You will know what to say/not what to say. You’ll help them go to those appointments Etc etc. Yeah it’s fucking hard but overtime it gets better. But that first step is education for everyone.

Edit: Another point I wanted to make.. That’s why I go on reddit, and why I love the community. To help educate myself as well. I’m obviously not an expert on bipolar. But I believe it’s better for me to be educated, and know what to expect if my BPSO is going through something."
BipolarSOs,f2x8xej,t1_f2wkccs,1570475029.0,"Hi all, thanks for the replies. I just wanted to say that I do know all the reasons as to why someone wouldn’t take their medication during an episode. But i appreciate the reminders. I understand that’s the evil/symptom of the disease for some, but not all. There’s certainly a big percentage of people who aren’t educated, right? Education doesn’t just mean patient too, it’s making sure the doctor is telling you everything you need to know. 

You said ‘imposter syndrome’, but if they were educated in knowing that bipolar disorder isn’t something that goes away and there’s no ‘quick fix’, wouldn’t they have asked their doctor for more information, get a re-diagnosis or told them their concerns before going off meds? Education is not just about knowing the disease. It’s also about asking questions. And I’m not saying this is just for bipolar. It’s for any type of illness in general. I work in the medical field too, and I constantly hear patients saying they don’t know anything about their disease etc, and I always take the time to explain everything to them. Example: for a bacterial illness, you have to take ALL the antibiotics required even if you feel better. This is because of antibiotic resistance. Going off the antibiotics allow bacteria still in your body to get used to that med. so then the next time you’re sick, it takes even longer for your body to fight it. Or it may not be able to fight it all. 

I do understand the point you guys are all making about people with BP thinking differently. Just personally having a BPSO, and other people that I’ve met with BP who are in the medical field all know this importance, even when going through an episode. Again, I’m not trying to offend anyone and this is just my personal opinion and things I’ve read and seen on reddit."
BipolarSOs,f2watch,t1_f2w4g7w,1570463498.0,"Agree with this 100% ^. TBH i don’t understand this logic. I don’t mean to offend, but people really need to be more educated or do more research. I don’t understand why people believe, “oh I feel better, so I should stop taking my meds” or “this makes me feel sick, so I should stop”. If you had high blood pressure, would you stop taking your medication because it’s now at a good level? NO, because if you stop taking it, your blood pressure would sky rocket again. Same thing with EVERY illness, disease etc. if it doesn’t make you feel good, then tell your doctor! 

He should definitely not be cutting his dosage. It’s prescribed for a reason. Usually seroquel should work right away, but then again it’s different for everyone. Your body needs to adjust, and let it take its time to fully figure out what it needs to do with this med. Try to get him to go back to his doctor, and tell his doctor that he’s been cutting his dosage. The meds are super important to keep them stable, whether they feel better or not. There are even side effects if you stop.

Again, sorry if i offended someone but i strongly believe that education is a big role. DM me if you need too. My BPSO is a doc, so he knows the importance of taking your medication To stay stable.. so I’m very fortunate in that way when I read other peoples stories. I’m sincerely sorry you’re going through this. I know it’s hard.. but please do reach out to family because you have a little one on your hands. You shouldn’t have to go through this alone."

BipolarReddit,f1d2zpz,t3_d8vbem,1569372546.0,"My SO is a family medicine resident with bipolar type 1. The week he got diagnosed, he voluntarily checked himself into the hospital. After about 4 days, he wanted to leave.. but the psychiatrists said, “if you leave AMA, then this will be a permanent blip on your medical license, and the medical board will question why you left. It will also be hard for you to find a job afterwards” basically he felt that he was being treated unfairly (obviously they were just doing what they thought was best) and was being punished for taking care of himself.. that really hurt and stressed him even more. 

Fortunately, his residency program is very supportive. They told him to get ADA, and another program that supports physicians with illnesses so that they are still able to practice. They changed his schedule around, and even got him off nights. All of the program attendings and coresidents knew what was going on, and helped him + me through this whole ordeal. They constantly check up on us to make sure we’re okay. 

Therefore, I’m so so sorry you’re going through this. I cant imagine how you must be feeling. From what the attending told me, is as long as you’re doing right by your patients, nothing should keep you from practicing! I hope things work out for you, because you’ve worked damn hard to get where you are today. Keep your head up!"

BipolarSOs,ezjw5lp,t3_d1ahed,1567951252.0,"Have you read “loving someone with bipolar” yet? That book has given me so many tips! Even my BPSO read it after he felt more comfortable in accepting his diagnosis! It’s really helped him to figure out what to do if he gets triggered by something or how to avoid the trigger. I’d suggest also searching up videos on YouTube from a bipolar persons perspective. Or look at the bipolar Reddit. 

I believe that all relationships are the same (bipolar or not) in terms of arguments or communication. I would say that he has as much power in ya’lls relationship as you do. It’s not fair of you to pry things out of him when he’s not in the right head space. I’ve learned to leave him alone if he’s upset about something. I will ask if he’d like to talk about it, and if he says no, then I’ll give him some space. He will usually come to me and vent, or discuss the issue when he’s more calm down. Having him discuss the issue in hand will just cause more stress because he needs time to dissect the problem.

I CONSTANTLY remind myself that relationships are 60/40, with you trying your hardest to give the other person the 60. With this you can get together and create expectations of yourselves and each other. Considered this as setting boundaries. And being as clear as when things are too far or too much will help. Go take a walk, or do something else to get your mind off things and give yourself space as well. Otherwise you’ll end up saying hurtful things that could end badly. I know it’s hard because you want immediate results, but all relationships take work. You got this!!"

BipolarSOs,ezjbwr1,t3_d18qna,1567942139.0,"Was your BPSO empathetic before? Mine is, but not during one of his episodes. In both cases of either depression or manic, I always tell him how I feel. He acknowledges it, but tells me he can’t share those feelings back because he doesn’t have the energy to even take care of himself, or because he doesn’t want to care since he has too many other things on his mind. (ex: ruminating thoughts about work, about past, about hurting himself or others) If your SO is currently in an episode, you can’t ask much of him.. he really needs to focus on how he can get out of the episode so he doesn’t hurt himself, you, or anyone else more. As much as we want our BPSO to be there for us whilst they’re in a episode, you gotta remember that you need to learn to be happy by yourself.

He’s a doctor, and he knows he shouldn’t do those things, but it’s an addictive feeling to be bad. What I do, or am trying to do... is to take care of myself first. You say you also suffer from depression. But how will you be able to help her if you yourself are depressed? I know it’s easier said than done but you need to start putting yourself first. Go exercise, eat well, get support from friends/reddit. And take it day by day. You don’t need to look at how the future will be (and yes I know it’s sooo hard, I think about it a lot). You just need to get through today. Give her some space for right now. When she’s ready, and if she ever is, figure out how you guys will get through today together. 

Is it worth all this pain? I don’t know. But there will be good days, and there may be a lot of bad.. and for some reason, those good days make being in this relationship worth it. Keep your head up. There’s only so much we can do as their partner. But you always come first in your life."
