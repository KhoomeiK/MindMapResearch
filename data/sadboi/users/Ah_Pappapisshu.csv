If you like monster collecting and evolving, kinda like the Pokemon games, you may enjoy the familiars in Ni no Kuni 1. Lots of different ones to collect and with different abilities.

The only real minigames in the first one, that I can recall, were the gambling and I guess the arena may count? The combat is imo better, as you can set your team mates to do absolutely nothing or go all out and you can customize the familiars they use. No team mate blindly rushing into battle as the boss is charging up an attack. I felt that the leveling was also better scaled, as I never really had the need to grind levels... just materials for the alchemy recipes.

I could do without half of the party members in NNK2, because they felt so tacked on and shallow and I couldn't be bothered to care about them.  Evan was really the only one that was sort of fleshed out in the group, which baffled me cause the game started you out with Roland and then shifted away from him. The massive information dump at the end of the game really made me angry, like they could have better integrated the whole thing as the story progressed. It was like, ""Oh shit! We forgot this ingredient (plot point) while making this meal (game), better just add it at the end and hope it's still good.""

I honestly despised the RTS battles and avoided doing them, but then I *had* to do them to advance the story and later on to complete recruiting all the townsfolk. On the other hand, I definitely loved the kingdom building element and recruiting citizens, except for recruiting the one via the RTS. Reminded me a lot of the Suikoden games that I love. However, I built everything up so quickly that I was left with a lot of kingsguilders until I beat the game and could finally advance my buildings to the next stage. I wish they'd given us options to let us choose where to put the buildings like Dark Cloud or even walk around your kingdom, like you do in the other towns, instead of in the chibi-fied world map view.
