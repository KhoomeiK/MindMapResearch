Some others who have commented before yourself were respectful, note how in my post i mentioned not being exclusitory. You, yourself can believe there are only two genders, or that you cant change your gender. You can believe that.

This issue comes into play when that belittles or attacks others by being exclusitory. touting there are only two genders is the issue, believing it is not.

As an analogy, people hating on nazis isnt wrong, thats because their views are exclusitory, harrassing and attacking. where as, hating on nazis is hating on the exclusitory behaviour and unfairness that it brings.
