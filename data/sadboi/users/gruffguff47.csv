Well these men all got shakes, I figured the faster I made them the faster they would go away and get their stink-ass vibe out of our food court. She was mad that I didn’t help her out, but I told her I thought that if I made the shakes fast enough they would go away.
The gang leader didn’t want whipped cream, but wanted the cherry. I made it correctly, but the cherry dissolved into the shake cause that’s what it does. This dude comes back and tells my manager “hey since I didn’t get my cherry, can I have yours?” I was so disgusting and disappointed that I didn’t know what to do!

For me it was my friend pushing me cause he saw all the signs. He would get so mad when I didn’t make an appointment but I come from a family where one side only takes vitamins but the other abused medical drugs. It was so hard for me to go in at all cause usually the hospital means bad things. My family not taking preventive care and went in when it was too late or abusing doctors who care put a fear in me of being like one and thinking I’m making up problems.

I really hope this works for me, my dad is watching me go through this. He finally understands mental illness is a thing because it happened to him. So I’m hoping if this helps me I can clear up a little more of the mental illness stigma my family holds, which confuses me since my aunt and cousin take medication as well.

Anyways, thank you for the love and I wish love and safety back to you!"
