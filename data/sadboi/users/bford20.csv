Anxiety,fo5d2va,t3_g5lc4j,1587522770.0,"I like to think of Kevin from Home Alone saying ""Shut Up"" to the creepy furnace in his basement when my intrusive thoughts come about. Puts some humor in my hell."
PMDD,fnfqr2n,t1_fn8r53l,1586913505.0,"I feel you. I have severe anxiety around this time. I think I have PMDD too, but haven't been diagnosed.
