depression,et6y4w0,t1_et6xzpa,1562521310.0,I’m 20 this year and I’m really starting to believe she doesn’t love me but when I tell her that she laughs at me and says I’m being silly. When I know she knows she’s treating me badly.
depression,esdd545,t1_erjwobg,1561853929.0,I know the feeling. I’m terrified of my mother and I’m scared of my family. They all think these horrible things and call me names and when I tell them I’m tired of living and that they make me hate myself or make me feel unloved they just say I’m being dramatic. I don’t understand.
