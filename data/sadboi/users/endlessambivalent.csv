therapy,fpundo2,t1_fpumydw,1588917657.0,True. My parents would be worried as soon as they see discomfort. Thank you.
AskReddit,fpun8dj,t3_gffps6,1588917534.0,"That I was trying to suffocate my little step sister when she was an infant. I was merely watching lying on her stomach while her mom was cleaning up in the bathroom. 

Her dad came in, noticing that there was a toy in between her stomach and the mattress she was lying on, which was causing her discomfort. So he scolded me for trying to kill her. 

I was eleven years old. My parents divorced when I was three. If anything I was genuinely glad that I have a sibling to play with. But he didn’t believe me."
therapy,fps4465,t1_fps3gwh,1588867137.0,Thank you so much! I do sometimes hold back on certain things cuz I don’t wanna feel too exposed or dramatic. Now I realize this won’t help me in getting the help I needed. So next time I’ll try to be more honest and explicit with my problems. Thank you again. All the best to you too!
therapy,fprv5fc,t1_fpruvhg,1588862643.0,I see. Thank you!
mentalillness,fpfi1y5,t3_gcszpe,1588571875.0,Several times in a day. Or I just have low mood for days and suddenly get irritated when things come up. I reckon it’s common for us people. It’s okay to be like that.
BingeEatingDisorder,fpets76,t1_fpdmltf,1588554769.0,Same here. Need to take care of ourselves. Don’t make it too extreme.
depressed,fpetewa,t1_fpeol2h,1588554542.0,Thanks. All the best to you.
BingeEatingDisorder,fpep29o,t1_fpdrqq0,1588551916.0,"That sounds like something doable and sustainable. And like you said It’s probably not easy to stick to it, but I for sure will try it out. Thank you."
depressed,fpeos0n,t1_fpdpuyj,1588551746.0,No worries. Thank you. I’m okay atm! Hope you’re okay too.
depressed,fpeo93t,t1_fpe6d2v,1588551422.0,"Thank you. I’m sorry but I’m glad we’re still here. You totally got me by saying I don’t wait for a miracle. I suppose, like many people, I don’t have no motives of getting things changed. I don’t have any support group unfortunately, but thank you for understanding me."
BingeEatingDisorder,fpem6o4,t1_fpe913y,1588550237.0,"I’m so happy for you! Well done love! 
I am eating my emotions away. Whenever something (bad or good) happens, I turn to eating to cope. You’re definitely right in saying this is not a fix in the long run. I reckon a better habit for sure exist. I will find it eventually. Thank you!"
BingeEatingDisorder,fpelp43,t1_fpehyii,1588549970.0,"Hahah! I can totally relate. I didn’t technically stop eating. I just eventually had had enough. 
Initially, I do still feel guilty and would want to compensate by trying to restrict/fast the next day but never succeeded. I guess I’m too week and at some point I just give in."
depressed,fpdcnzu,t1_fpdcfgh,1588524376.0,Exactly. I’m so tired of this mental torture...
