self,fmee83g,t3_fuq08m,1586000752.0,How kind of you. Please give any coins for me to someone else. I got a boost just from seeing your act of random kindness. You are awsome!
TrueOffMyChest,fm6dof4,t3_ft9fi6,1585791771.0,"I completely understand your post. I am a straight female. Being a very accepting open person I dated a women that treated me the best I have ever been treated by a partner. But I had to be drunk to have sex with her. I terminated the best relationship I ever had. Because I simply wasn't gay. She didn't care. She told me I could be with men when I wanted and needed to. She loved me more than I had ever been loved. It was the most painful acceptance of my truth. I always thought being gay was a choice. It wasn't for me. I couldn't make my body respond to what my mind wanted to have. I think your incredibly brave, honest and strong to post your truth. There are alot of people that are grateful of your honesty about your feelings. Thank you for being brave. I am proud of you"
confession,fkqd0mt,t3_fjzje2,1584440994.0,I have done that many times. Best adventures of my life. First time stayed in my move place for 11 years. Moved many more times. Never regretted any. Now I am 100% happy to stay right where I am. When I gave into my wanderlust. It got satisfied and went to sleep.

psychotherapy,faiekhx,t3_e932wo,1576105979.0,I started my menstrual cycle at ten. Considering  my mother was not very open or knowledgeable about over active hormones I was looked at as behavioral problems. My daughter also went through the same moods at the same age as me. Since I am proactive in her female self awareness. History of lack of care and/or misdiagnosis did not repeat itself

mentalhealth,f5joxlv,t3_do06tv,1572235021.0,"The basic story is. If a person only feels ""crazy"" around other people. More than likely it is anxiety. Everyone has anxiety. Un-treated anxiety does not  =crazy. Why would mental health doctors give people treatment to cure or self manage mental health problems? That would make less business for them. That = less money for them. More than anything I am tired of people not facing the fact it is all about making money on the blood,sweat and tears of other people's mental health."
