In my defense, I’m fairly certain the majority of white people in the area of the US I grew up in would not consider him white. His thick accent, dark hair and olive skin make him Arab at best, a sand n***** at worst (according to the majority of my former high school classmates).

The first time it happened, my husband bailed and was virtually MIA while I was in the hospital with my daughter. We separated after this. Through years of counseling and therapies for both of us, we’ve learned we are both suffering from ptsd due to early childhood trauma.

The instinct in stressful situations is very difficult to control, especially if one is not fully aware of what they are doing. 

We have a plan in place now of what to do if there is an emergency. Basically, I step in to control the situation and bring in other trusted friends to help support. He stays with our other daughter at home. We also have friends to help him care for our other daughter. I know this is not ideal. But it is what allows us to best care for our kids.

AmItheAsshole,fbqjqws,t1_fbpqhhp,1577032463.0,"I am in a mixed relationship as well. My husband is from a small Middle Eastern country and I am from the West. I've always enjoyed visiting as a tourist, but I hate traveling back to his country to visit his family. His family is not in the capital city. They are in an area of the country that is not frequented by tourists very often. 

I understand your frustration with being stuck all day in the house with a young child. My husband too would spend a good portion of his day visiting friends and I would be left alone with our kids. Going out is not as easy and enjoyable as many of the commenters in this sub make it seem, especially with kids.

On the occasions I did venture out, the language barrier was frustrating. It would usually take several tries to get the taxi driver to understand where I wanted to go. And then I would have to deal with the questions of where I am from, why am I here, who is my family, where are they, why am I going where I am going, why am I going alone, etc.

And once we got to where we were going, it wasn't much fun either. I didn't have another adult to enjoy the experience with. But I did have young children to entertain. I tried making friends with neighbors, but it never worked out. Most people in his city have never left the city and it was difficult to find much in common. The gossiping was also irritating.

After the last trip, I put my foot down. I decided I will not go back again with him to visit his family. He is more than welcome to take the kids and visit whenever he'd like. And his family is more than welcome to visit us. I also don't mind to visit the capital city where it is much easier to get around as a foreigner.

DigitalMarketing,fba4zrk,t3_ec88gj,1576664872.0,"Keep your business separate from your personal story. I was in a similar situation. I was still in the early stages of my real estate business when my daughter was seriously injured in an accident. A family member helped put a facebook page and we hit over 100,000 followers in a little over a week. We had sponsorship offers and donations pouring in. I learned a lot about marketing from that experience.

My first thought was to capitalize on this. It had taken me months to reach 1,000 followers on Facebook organically. When I did ask our community followers to support my business, many of them did start following me on Instagram and Facebook. However, their engagement remained low. And it did little to add to my bottom line. 

One of the hurdles that I found myself having to overcome was that I became known as the mom of the girl who fell from a window and spent several weeks in a coma. I was not being recognized as a smart and hardworking real estate agent that was successful in helping her clients purchase and sell homes. Although people were sympathetic to my story and wanted to help, at the end of the day, they would choose to hire someone who was known as an established real estate agent over me, someone who they knew had recently gone through a very difficult time.

What I did find some success in was when my business sponsored charity events related to our cause. Our cause also provided some great networking opportunities and opportunities to meet influential members of our community.

Another thing to consider is, Are your community followers your target audience? In my experience, most of my followers were middle-aged women. And while a good number were living in my community, 50% or more were living outside of my community, out of state, or abroad. They were not my target audience.

So bottom line, take what you've been lucky enough to learn from your tragedy and apply it to your business. You can mention that you are launching a marketing business to your community, as you continue to document your story for your support community. And you can sponsor your non-profit through your business. But keep your business and personal life separate."

It wasn't until I hit 110 lbs at 5'10"" that my mom finally mentioned something. She didn't do anything, even though I told I hadn't had a period in over a year and had started to develop that weird body hair people with EDs get.  
I am glad to have found this community. I knew that my ED was not only about my body image. I've always been happy with the way my body looked for the most part. It is nice to know that I didn't go through dealing with an ED because there was something wrong with me.   
While, 20 years later, I still don't have a great relationship with food, I don't struggle with my diet. For me, my ED improved drastically when I started working a part-time job after school and I had a boss that cared for me."
CPTSD,f9xn6te,t3_e79z60,1575714647.0,"My mom sending me to the basement every night. My mom didn't want to be bothered by me or my siblings after dinner. So, she would send us to our rooms or, in my case, the unfinished basement while she watched T.V. Then, around 8:00 pm I was forced upstairs to pray with her and go to bed. It is so demoralizing to be stuck in a dirty basement night after night because you are so needy that even your batshit, crazy mom finds you annoying (It took me years to realize I was not the problem)."

raisedbynarcissists,f8az9hb,t3_dzwn2y,1574420034.0,Is your mom my mom? Growing up I was always told the house was messy because of me and my siblings. The truth came out though after we all moved out and more and more stuff moved in.

dubai,f80s4jj,t1_f80rtup,1574136791.0,Thank you for sharing.
offmychest,f7rf6cq,t3_dxgtoe,1573980258.0,"Thank you for sharing this. My daughter was horrifically injured in an accident at home, maybe not as bad as the kid you cared for, but she was my daughter. There was a lot of blood... and the sounds she was making... I saw the look of terror in her eyes that i hope to never see again. I’ve tried to talk to people about what I saw that day, but no one seems to understand."
raisedbynarcissists,f7qmtm0,t1_f7p5kd2,1573966273.0,"My nmom started harassing my younger brother about his bathroom usage sometime after I moved out. She started constant arguments about it with him. Eventually he did start locking the door and ignoring her when she started banging on the door. Her response? She bought a portable toilet, used it, and would clean it out in the kitchen sink while my brother was eating. So disgusting."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f7qlbp9,t1_f7p3d4q,1573965632.0,Mine is from Syria. He once told me the current civil war there is my fault. I’m American and therefore I am responsible for what is happening over there.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f7pv5ca,t3_dxfos4,1573954913.0,Good for you for getting out. He sounds like me a\*\*hole stbx narc.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f7nqi2h,t3_dx5mvk,1573913152.0,"Mine never admitted responsibility for anything. His business failing, my fault. Him losing 50k at the casino, my fault. His relationship problems with his family, my fault. His secretary not liking him, my fault. Him cheating on me, my fault. His depression, my fault. His lack of self confidence, my fault. The list goes on and on."
medizzy,f7ljam6,t1_f7lisdt,1573841675.0,She was pretty out of it for a while. She does remember bits of rehab. And the memories she has of rehab are mostly good ones.
medizzy,f7lefbr,t1_f7le64e,1573838690.0,"It was a large window on the second story. It was open. We think she just leaned against the screen, it popped out, and she fell."
medizzy,f7le478,t1_f7lcewu,1573838500.0,It definitely takes a special kind of person to do peds. The doctors and nurses we've had have always been amazing. My nephew is studying cardiology and when I asked him about going into pediatric cardiology he said the same thing.
medizzy,f7lbf4v,t1_f7ky9fg,1573836849.0,Thank you
medizzy,f7lbckj,t1_f7kzq0i,1573836806.0,"We looked into doing that. She is doing well and making progress in her recovery. We want to do everything we can to help her recover. But we also want to make sure she has time to be a kid. And with all the drs appointments, therapies, and school there is not much time left for her to just be a kid."
medizzy,f7laesz,t1_f7l02db,1573836220.0,Thanks for the correction. I’m not a medical professional and just based off what I have in my notes from her hospital stay.
medizzy,f7la5zt,t1_f7l2gr6,1573836065.0,"She had to learn to walk again. The PT was exhausting for her. But unlike many adults, she never let her failures from the previous day stop her from trying again and doing her best."
medizzy,f7l9vn5,t1_f7l9kr9,1573835884.0,"Thank you. I really think the support we received from friends, family, neighbors, and strangers too. Made a huge difference in her recovery."
medizzy,f7l9pnx,t1_f7l7ys0,1573835779.0,We were in the US. She was at a hospital in Southern CA.
medizzy,f7kvw36,t1_f7kvhhx,1573827356.0,We didn't see it happen. But we think she was leaning against the screen of an open window and just fell head first through the window.
medizzy,f7kulno,t1_f7ku4rh,1573826321.0,Thank you. This was 4 years ago. She is doing really well today. She's definitely come a long way.
medizzy,f7ku5qi,t1_f7ktlbz,1573825961.0,Thank you. This was almost 4 years ago. We've been incredibly blessed since the accident. We had incredible support from our community. The doctors and hospital staff did an amazing job treating and caring for her. Her speech therapists and teachers have done a great job helping her to overcome some of her difficulties. And she has the determination to overcome her difficulties that most adults don't have.
medizzy,f7kt9o3,t1_f7kls9j,1573825210.0,This was such a good day. They did not expect her to come off the ventilator and be so responsive. This was the 3rd or 4th attempt to get her off the ventilator. She had been in a pentobarb coma for 21 days so far and it was starting to affect her other organs. It was kind of a do or die moment (literally). All that day nurses and staff kept stopping by her room because they could not believe she was responding and making purposeful movements.
