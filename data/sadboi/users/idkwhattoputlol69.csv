ugly,fmdykx3,t1_fmduwqh,1585982366.0,"Ugh ik I have the tiniest eyes too. It doesn't help that I have bags which make them even smaller!

And I've actually heard of mewing, though I have a ton of forward growth already so it's never done much for me, but if your jaw is recessed I definitely recommend it. If you check out r/mewing (I think) there's not the best information but the before and after pictures are fucking insane.

It does take a reallly long time though, but I'd say it's definitely worth it.

I happen to know a lot about this stuff cause I like to draw so if you have any more questions feel free to ask!"
ugly,fmdu1bm,t3_full9l,1585977930.0,"I would say the face shapes that tend to have the most attractive women are heart and oval, face shape is not the biggest contributor but a general rule of thumb is that you don't want your jaw to be too big.

A positive canthal tilt is normally preferred, but some people can pull off a negative.

I'm sure you know this one but high cheekbones and a pointy chin and very good factors, also a smaller, upward facing nose.

I'd say that sharper and less bulky features are good.

As for eyes, big eyes are good, but if your cheekbones aren't high enough you could have what I call 'bug eyes', where the under-eye kind of puffs out. 

Big lips are a nice bonus but I definitely don't think they're as important as eyes, but maybe that's just my opinion.

I don't know how much you use makeup, but I would look into contouring and such

Now I'm going to go cry bc I have basically none of these features"

I’m not sure if you knew, but J’s are planners, they like routine, they feel happy and good when everything is planned out and get stressed out when things go out of order/routine.

And REMEMBER: you don’t need to be 100% of the letter to be it. I’m not 100% feeling, but overall, I use my feeling more than my thinking. I’m not sure if anyone is 100% one thing and 0% the other."

Him feeling sad when other ppl are sad is tough, but one thing to think about is that if he’s as sweet as you’ve described him as, he’s probably worried sick about you, and maybe clearing the air about your yeets might bring him some peace. But I don’t know him as well as you, so maybe I’m wrong. 

Also, I promise you he will not think any less of you. First off, you two seem really close, and something like yeeting will not affect your relationship. Second of all, he also yeeted himself, he of all people would understand. And lastly, he doesn’t seem like the type, from the description I’ve heard. 

I understand that anxiety can mess with your reasoning, and even the best convincing can’t make you stop worrying, that’s just anxiety, but I think that when you’re ready, you’ll know, and you might have to push yourself to tell him, but I think it’ll have been worth it
