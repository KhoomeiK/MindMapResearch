Realme,fm0h2wn,t1_flxqwld,1585657539.0,"It's true,the software is the same on India and Europe,I've been getting my updates from the India software page for months because they are slow to update the European page and sometimes only update it every 2 months.

Stick with the India page for faster updates. You will only see differences in the software based on the region you choose for your phone in region and language settings"

Realme,fl9wo0y,t3_fnji2a,1584971247.0,"My guess is by end of this week,Am on the early access beta here and it's pretty good. They said March so I trust them.

Would just keep an eye on Realme India software page because the EU site is sometimes slow"
PickAnAndroidForMe,fl6mcz0,t3_fmxbjj,1584875435.0,"Check out the Realme X2 pro or the newer one with the Realme  x50 pro if you can get that,not sure it's available in Europe,

Came from the 6T myself and the X2 pro has everything you would need including ufs 3.0 storage,90hz,and 8 or 12gb ram variants up to 256gb storage.Battery is decent too,lasts me a day typically with 50 watt charging.

Coming from Oneplus the only thing I would say you miss the open betas though Realme doing decent job with updates so far,1 a month with latest security patch.
RealmeUI just about to be released and it's very good  with closer to stock feel,I am running the latest early access beta and no problems.

I would consider one of the Xaoimi phones also, OnePlus getting too expensive IMO,no point in waiting for the op8,though maybe a cheap 7t or 7 pro though I have no regrets with the x2 pro,It is a beast of a phone with crazy specs"
Realme,fl3j12l,t3_fm9qjy,1584786269.0,I can't say I have this problem and have tried colorOS and currently on  RealmeUI Beta
