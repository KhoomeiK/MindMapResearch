Overwatch,fgxo9ed,t1_fgvlllq,1581174929.0,"Hey! Its hard for me to give good Tips but i'll try.

Get a bigger hero pool, if u know how to play the other hero's u will know better where they could/will be and what they will do.

Use basic comps, learn which hero fits with eachother, for example rein/zarya sigma/zarya hog/orisa etc. Then the fitting DPs like mccree/hanzo with a shield comp or a mccree/doom for a aggressive rein/zarya combo for example, and if your tanks or DPs won't change to a fitting comp change yourself and support their playstyle as best as u can.

I see often that nobody saw the doom who is hiding behind for an ez kill but you and he gets the pick, 
Communication is a big factor, I know from myself that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with using vc but simple things like ""doom behind"" ""zarya low, no personal (bubble)"" are gamechangers.

See your abilities as resources, I like to categorize them, use the ""worst"" resource to outplay the enemy's, its hard to form that in text I'm sorry, like moving, cooldowns, ultimates in this order move out of the way/line of sight for their abilities, if thats not enough use cooldowns, and worstcase use your ultimate to counter ultimate, for example when genji blades, run away, if that is not possible, use flashbang on mccree or charge him as rein, if that isn't enough or possible u can trade ult for ult, solo shatter him as rein, grave him as zarya, highnoon him as mccree etc etc. 

Ultimates are freaking important, if u win a team fight with 1 or 2 ults and u are in a 6v3 now, don't use any more ults. 

Learn when team fights are won or lost, don't invest too much ults. Look WHO died, if u pick their mainheal and they get one of your DPs, go in! But don't rush too hard, use the advantage of more heals and take the fight slow (but not too slow) 

If u have questions just ask me! :)
