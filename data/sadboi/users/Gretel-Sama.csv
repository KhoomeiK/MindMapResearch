I remember also, when I was a teenager been told: “that’s something just a prostitute puts on”, referring to my eyeliner. With many other things I received the same comments, wish I could forget all that."

This is something I’m also trying to apply in my life, it can be very hard at times and more because in my case my bf has adhd and when he hyper focuses on something he doesn’t reply even after hours, and well my mind does never thinks of that and well, you know how it goes. But I’m trying to use alarms and instead of keep on checking, I check every half an hour or something like that, depending on how well he is.

I hope you can keep up, and also be more happy everyday💕"
