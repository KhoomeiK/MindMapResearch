BPD,fk3fur5,t3_ffwd2g,1583831476.0,"Little encouragement: 

I thought I was gonna be alone forever but somehow some way I found my people. I’m so bloody weird. I’m talking sometimes I instantly get excited and start dancing to no music in public. Or sometime I just refuse to respond to text or calls etc -I call it my detachment from the world. it’s not intentional, sometimes I just cannot move or leave my room :((

And somehow they stay. They are still here when I come back to the state where I can reply and stuff. They are still here when I’m clingy. They are still here when I am weird. They are still here when I am angry. They are still here when I am incredibly sad for absolutely no reason. They are still here! I’m so scared that one day they will be gone but I tell myself that they are still here! 

So don’t worry. You will find your people💕 
They might not fully understand you, but they will stay. 


I hope this message gets to you well. X"

OCPoetry,fj15rcv,t3_fale5t,1582913495.0,"First of all this was a really good piece, i enjoyed reading it! I also like the flow to this poem. It feels like a journey, from a place of (awareness, anger, confidence) to a place of (meek, trivial) The start makes me believe that the author is somewhat strong or in a position where they may feel a level of confidence. But as it progresses you start to see the start to breakdown, getting needy (a kinda begging for answers) getting weak. 

I love this line

>the hum of a mosquito while you try to sleep 

It feels very familiar to me.  I grew up in Nigeria and boy o boy do I remember the mosquito hum"

OCPoetry,fiq4rzh,t3_f97u1l,1582635081.0,"I love the sincerity in your piece.  The way you start with 

>i'm in pain

blocks me a bit (from wanting to read) and makes me feel like what ever this person is about to say - do i even want to hear it? do i wanna know their pain? but then the next line 

>There's no other way to say it  
>  
>There's nothing to gain  
>  
>But I may as well admit it

it brought my attention back, it in a way to me made you human. It makes me want to know about your pain. 

Also i hope that you are okay."

I love how you described the beast. It was like I saw the beast and I knew the beast.  In this bit “the beast slumbered deeply child-like and serene though the bottles that surrounded him made the picture more obscene” - this is my favourite part. 
It made the beast seem not so bad in the sense that I (as the reader) may relate to the beast and be okay with that but at the same time see him for him. 

That particular line game me two different emotions."
