loseit,evylx0w,t3_clpzii,1564935751.0,important to recognise that part of the reason they might be hitting on you could be due partly to a newfound body confidence? i’ve lost a lot of weight recently and have had many guys hitting on me and asking me out but after talking to several people i feel like its down to me loving and being more confident in my body and that’s a super attractive thing to people!!!
