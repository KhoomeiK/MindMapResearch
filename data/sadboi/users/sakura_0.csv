Anxiety,fngyy2m,t3_g1pike,1586949977.0,"Yes, it is a defense mechanism in such a stressful situation. I know it is scary but try, little by little, not to pile up your anxiety thinking about it."
Anxiety,flzkbsb,t3_frslfn,1585625766.0,"I don’t know if your fear/anxiety has the same roots than mine, but something that was really hard for me to learn is that people who love you will do it unconditionally, the same way you do.

An exercise that can help you is trying to shift the way you’re thinking and ask yourself “if my friend did the exact same thing, how I would react?”. Be kind and gentle with yourself, you are a good human being that cares a lot about how others are feeling :)."

brasil,fln7ztf,t1_fln72hn,1585311981.0,"O processo de impeachment é demorado e pode travar a votação de medidas urgentes neste cenário de epidemia. A melhor saída seria que ele renunciasse, mas o cara não está disposto a isso, prefere sacrificar milhares de vidas a deixar o cargo."
Anxiety,fiae1uc,t3_f79kb6,1582299102.0,"It works well on “calming” your body, but your mind keeps on the anxious state. I guess on long term use it could help on reducing the accelerated thoughts as well because when your body is calmer, you can rationalize better.
It didn’t work well on me because I had mental confusion. This is a rare side effect, so I recommend trying it. :)"
Borderline,fhbd2tg,t1_fhb94fb,1581439796.0,"Yes! Don’t worry about grammar! Try talking about what you’re feeling, that’s more important than perfect writing."
Showerthoughts,ff7wux6,t3_es3xix,1579660261.0,"This is so weird, because I have always felt this way and have never encountered someone who said felt the same. Thanks, O.P. :)"
Drugs,fc8vxwa,t3_egq3uz,1577542894.0,"This is weird, but I’ve had a similar experience eating a space cake in Amsterdam. It wasn’t years that went by, but months, and it wasn’t as vivid as this, I had a feeling like a great amount of time had passed by but I didn’t live events like you did. It was like I was paralyzed. It was horrible! 

Crazy shit man."
Borderline,f50nrs4,t3_dmalyu,1571930202.0,"This is just amazing! I find it really difficult transmitting the feelings of having BPD, and this can really help growing some empathy on other people. I hope I can think of a story to share :). Thank you for doing this."
BPD,f1g7stv,t3_d9bh9v,1569461713.0,I am sending you a big hug! :) :*
Borderline,evyhlay,t3_clwzfq,1564932806.0,"I went to 3 therapists in 6 years until I was diagnosed. It is not an easy task, because not every person with BPD is the same or has the classic BPD profile, I would recommend you to find an experienced professional. But either way, don’t focus only on finding a name for what you feel (though it can be comforting and may help the treatment), find a professional you feel comfortable with, not judged and truly willing to help you. Hope this helps :)"
