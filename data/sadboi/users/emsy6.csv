BPD,ff9pobr,t3_es85v9,1579718159.0,"I have never. Ever. Ever related to a post more in my entire life but I’ve been to afraid to bring it up because I thought it was just me. When I was seven I would print out these photos of naked people and show them around my extremely catholic school, I would also slap people on the ass ALOT and I would literally kiss everyone, on the mouth. With tounge. When I was eight I would dress extremely provocatively and at nine I started to experiment with talking to men six times my age. I would literally strip for them and send them a lot of photos and videos of “stuff”  that continued until I was 13, planned to meet up with a lot of them, I never did thank God but damn I never thought there were others or that it was a bpd thing. Sorry if that was really fucking graphic but yeah, I was a little fucked up. Still am but less"

BPD,fap5f9b,t1_famgubf,1576280314.0,"Im 13 and a diagnosed borderline and I completely agree with you, (for some of you saying you can’t) you can get an age appropriation test for children under 13 although it’s rare but some of us happen to fall under that ‘rare’ category. it’s in the DSM-5. So I don’t understand why an age restriction would be appropriate also  OPs comment on how it can be especially damaging on young brains blows my mind, you know what’s damaging to young brains, an entire life of abuse, neglect and trauma. Some of the adults can 100% relate to that and I bet you they would’ve like someone to talk too, someone to relate too."
BPD,fandsml,t3_e9w3pv,1576236346.0,"I’m 13 and have been diagnosed by several mental health professionals with BPD and a cluster fuck of other stuff, I agree that it may not be helpful for teens to be around adults with mental illnesses but from my perspective (obviously I can’t speak for others) but this sub has helped me through a lot of shit, sometimes it’s so comforting to talk to people that relate to you and your struggles, no matter the age and while I know that it’s extremely uncommon for people to be diagnosed at 13 but in my experience I tick all criteria and yes my brains still developing but that doesn’t invalidate my feelings. I don’t entirely see how my age can make people uncomfortable but I do acknowledge that they probably have I also apologise if any of you have come across my posts and felt uncomfortable your feelings are very valid"
