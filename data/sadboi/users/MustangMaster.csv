MagicArena,fpgfmkm,t1_fpgey10,1588601730.0,I‚Äôve used the Heliod but took it out. All wins from this deck have been from revenge of the ravens and bastion. The sweepers are for wiping the opponent if they get creature heavy but at the same time I purposefully sweep my own creatures. I rarely swing with my creatures I‚Äôm sacrificing them to bastion of remembrance and cruel celebrant paired with luminous broodMoth and nightveil Sheppard to bring them back. And also can continue to loop with woe strider sacrificing my tokens. Doom foretold is a back up to kill my creatures and bring them back at the same time keeping the opponent in check. I‚Äôve also added teysa Karlov to double trigger the bastion and cruel celebrant.

magicTCG,foqp8aa,t1_fopvlyv,1587998281.0,"One thing that is crazy about mutate is the way exile works with those creatures. If you have 5 creatures mutated on top of each other and choose to target the creature with Thassa, Thassa exiles the stack and brings back every single creature separately to the battle field. So if your opponent has let‚Äôs say 7 2/2 creatures and you don‚Äôt have a board wipe but you have 7 mutated creatures and a Thassa you can target to exile and return and get 7 creatures back as long as they were not two of the same legendary."
