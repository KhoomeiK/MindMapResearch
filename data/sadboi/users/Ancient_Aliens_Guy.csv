It was a budget build with a used GTX 770, which did fine for the good ole source engine games, bit of Minecraft and some light triple A titles. Cost me $750 and I held onto that for a year and a half. Then comes the seventh gen of Intel. I decided I’d buy my current cpu, new mobo, and new ram (This was right around the time ram was about to spike in price). Cost me around $450 I think. $200 for the Cpu maybe, $120 for the mobo, $130 for the ram. Picked up a 1070 one Christmas so my sister could make a gaming PC. Then, two years ago you had the RTX launch and everyone was ditching their “inferior” GTX 1080ti’s. I ended up selling my 1070 to my dad for my sister to use for $100 (the 770 died shortly before: rip) and I bit the bullet on the EVGA 1080Ti FTW3 for a steal of $550. Mint condition, not a scratch, came with everything on it, and looked like it hadn’t even left the box. Works like a charm to this day. 

So yeah, after a couple cosmetic changes (peripherals, g-sync monitor, case, fans) I have a monster build that I could probably sell for easily $3000, in the span of 5 years. My best investment yet.

I would know, I’m on an undergrad research team working with a rare species in conjunction with the local botanical garden. Hasn’t gotten off the ground yet due to COVID-19, but it’s in the works. The whole goal of research is to get your name out there as a scientist who knows his shit. In some areas, having your name on a published paper will get you farther than a Bachelors degree. Definitely worth the money, imo. 

Not trying to sound like an asshole with this. I thought I would just help explain from the inside how the system works.

HuntsvilleAlabama,flw8uu7,t1_flw8dso,1585542872.0,"This is kinda scary considering the spread rate of Coronavirus lately. 

Imagine if you recently travelled to NYC in the past five months, and you got a really bad cough that wouldn’t seem to go away. You already could’ve had it, undetected, from people who flew in from China. 

Just imagine if one of these people in the photo had just come back from NYC.

Edit: While I probably fell victim to a Facebook blunder, this was *supposed* to be hypothetical anyway. I have since updated my post for clarity. 

Additionally, the only way we track the spread of the virus is by testing. Nobody was testing in January in the US. The “explosion” you see is people getting tested that have had it for more than two weeks (since it takes two weeks for symptoms to manifest). In those two weeks, they have since a). Gotten infected, b). Gone to work at least once, c). Have probably infected at least one other person, and d). Went to get tested. And two weeks is the shortest symptoms can come up; it can be asymptomatic and you’d never know you had it until every one of your friends comes down with it. You could’ve had it for a month and not known it. Hence, my speculations on if someone in the picture had come back from NYC recently. It’s within the realm of possibilities, is all I’m saying.
