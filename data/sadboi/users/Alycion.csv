* In order to follow the social distancing guidelines, in the event that the store is busy, we may ask that patients return to their cars after checking in at Reception. The Receptionist will give you an order form to fill out as you wait, and you will receive a phone call when your Medtender is ready for you.
* During this time we also ask that no guests accompany patients with the exception of patients requiring physical assistance.
* MÜV brochures, physician brochures, and all other printed materials will be kept behind the reception desk. If you would like a copy of these materials, you need only ask.
* Product packaging will be removed from all but one retail island on the sales floor.
* MÜV Dispensaries will be closed Sundays effective March 22nd to facilitate deep cleaning and sanitizing of the store.

I don't think they realized how much attention, and not in a good way, it was going to bring. You guys made preseason a much better experience since most of the teams were screwing up the blackout restrictions on their streams for that.

However, it is a long term commitment and you need to make sure you are ready. If you would like a dog that is less work, consider adopting an adult or senior dog. They are usually already trained and if you go through a foster based rescue, the foster home can tell you all about the dog. Cats are much easier to take care of and make arrangements for when you get laid up. They too are easier to get as an adult. 

I fostered for awhile, until my physical got too bad to keep up with two huskies. A few things to keep in mind. Research the breed, if you are considering a specific breed, to make sure you can keep up with its needs. And if you do adopt from a rescue, the prices may look high compared to the pound, but they are fully taken care of. The amount of money put into getting these dogs healthy coming out of the pound costs way more than adoption fees. If you adopt from the pound, that is something you will be responsible for. 

There are smaller animals that can bring relaxation and don't require as much time like beta fish. All animals do require a time and money commitment, so if you don't feel you are ready, it may be best to wait. If you jump in too soon, the stress of the adjustment could make things worse. But if you are ready, it is all worthwhile. It's kind of like having kids, it's a personal choice. Do what's best for you. If you are thinking about a pet, don't limit your thinking to cats/dogs. There are tons of animals that make great companions that can help with bipolar that won't require as much time or money."

I have gotten great responses. Many people don't feel comfy asking me questions in publicly so they will message me. Sometimes I will post the question in a comment to the original post with my answer. I won't put who asked the question. But those are more for the subjects that you know others want to ask about and are too afraid to ask themselves. Once they see I'm open and nothing is taboo, people start really asking. I just ask that if I say that I'm not up to discussing it that they give me time and when I am up to it, I'll come back and talk. Sometimes people will ask about triggers and I'm in the mindset that even discussing them would trigger me. So when I'm out of that mindset, I'll talk to them more about it. Go at a pace that you and your family and friends can handle. If you slam them with too much too soon, sometimes you lose them. 

There is a song called Bipolar Baby by Forever the Sickest Kids. To me, it really speaks as to how people perceive me when I'm manic. So I'm in the process of taking the lyrics and next to it put what is going on in my head. So one of the lines is about starting fights for the sake of it. For me, it's frustration because my mind is running so fast I can't get the real words out, and it comes out wrong and then I start getting mad because people aren't getting me. I'm doing it for my shrink. I will be posting it when I'm done. Because for the first time, I feel like there are words to what I'm feeling.

On social media, I do a lot of shares from sites like NAMI and DBSA and I tell my story with the share. When there is an appropriate place to slide it into a conversation, I will. Last week I bumped into someone I talk to online in a fan group at a game. She mentioned her child may be bipolar. I immediately said that I was and if she had any questions to hit me up. I also told her how hard it was as a teen to be bipolar and not able to get help. And thanked her for trying to fight for her child to make sure that they wouldn't have to go through the hell that most of us went through when we were growing up untreated. 

I've been stressed from a ton of physical ailments. Stress will sometimes kick off mania. I've been a little manic. Which means I'll talk to anyone about anything. I've apologized with I'm sorry, I'm a bit manic. I don't shove it out there if it's not appropriate. I don't fly a flag. But if it opens up, I will. My twitter and facebook accounts are a lot of posts on Agent Orange and Mental Illness awareness. Both are near and dear to my heart. AO is for a different conversation, though some kids of Vets exposed are suffering from mental illness that did not run in the family. It does run in mine. So I can't blame that. But maybe that's why I'm so bad and about to be declared treatment resistant. Who knows."

BipolarReddit,f490tah,t3_djql6b,1571454217.0,"These things are part of a complete treatment plan. With physical illnesses, I had to change lifestyle things and diet. I do physical therapy.

And look at therapy. A lot of it is just Buddhist principals with different terms applied. Mindfulness is huge. If you practice it when you are stable, you may be one of the ones who are lucky enough to be able to grab it during manias and stop yourself from doing things. I have. Not 100%

When fighting an illness, any illness, it is important to try anything safe that is in your arsenal. I've used massage therapy, acupuncture, MMJ, yoga, physical therapy, and a few diet changes to help control pain from an autoimmune. I went from almost being in a wheelchair to taking surfing lessons. Not everyone with my autoimmune will have those results. But it did not hurt me to try that. So when it comes to bipolar, why would I treat it different. Medicine enables us to do the work. It won't completely fix it. 

But I think as others have said, it's offensive when we are told that that is all we need to do. Some people who are really lucky, that may be all they need. I know two people who were able to come off of meds because of that. But at least one of them, it turned out there was a physical cause of the depression. By making those changes, they were able to find the physical cause. Physical cause taken care of, no depression. Now that's 100% lucky and probably rarely happens. But the other person, they had issues tolerating any meds. So they had to find a way to try to go on the lowest possible dose. Fortunately, their words, not mine, their battle wasn't as deep and dark as most people's, so they were able to get off of meds. But I had people tell me that since I was doing all of that stuff, why am I still on my meds. I told them the same reason why I'm on a low dose of crestor after a heart attack even though my cholesterol is now fine. Because I want to keep things that way."

Because I know if it's low enough and I call over, chances are, it's probably free. They don't do it as much with maintenance drugs, but I heard that they were considering it for certain psychiatric maintenance drugs, to make sure people had a place to keep their treatment going when they got released from the hospital. That's a big problem here with the homeless. They release them with a script and no means of getting it filled. I do need to find that out, as I do tend to run into a lot of new to the area homeless at one of my normal stops. It's just at the intersection of a pretty busy area and where most people get dumped when they first land in the area. I try to keep track of resources to make sure they know where to go for help."
