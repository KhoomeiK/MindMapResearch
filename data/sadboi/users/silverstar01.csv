It helps to know at least you'll always stand by her side, and it'll mean a lot to her. The only tip I can think of right now is to be careful with how you ask and how you speak. I guess if you can phrase questions so it starts with ""is it okay...""

Edit: Telling her to think on the bright side, or to count her blessing, is not very helpful. No one wants to be depressed, but it's a physical and psychological illness. How I would describe depression: It's like being stuck in a deep well. Medicine and talk therapy is the rope you throw down to help her get out of that hole. Now she needs the energy and motivation to get out of that hole.

depression,f74mbww,t1_f74eosg,1573404620.0,"Once someone is diagnosed with depression it stays with them for the rest of their life.

Depressed people also have to learn on how to cope with it with ways such as, working out a lot to burn the energy, meditate to calm down, think about the positives in their lives, or some other way. Everyone is different so they use different methods. 

With drugs and alcohol, it is a form of escapism because something bad happened and it's stuck in their head so they drink and take drugs to escape that feeling. Something I noticed is that depressed people tend to crave escapism (I wish I can go back in time to fix my past, but obviously that won't happened.)

depression,f74ikmx,t1_f74e8i4,1573403058.0,"One thing I can say is, no one is really ""broken"". We think we are broken because society, environment, and culture says we are broken. We hide that we are depressed or suffering from an mental illness because in a sense society taught us this.

According to my doctor (he's also slightly depressed so he understands what we are going through) in a way we hate ourselves for one thing or another and we hold that grudge. (I hate myself because I think I'm a failure and wasted my life. If I can give my away to some child with terminal illness. I would do it without hesitation.) We fight with our inner self instead of looking for a solution. (I hate myself because I feel every choice I made in my life was a mistake and I can't let go of the past.) Once we are at peace with who we are (forgive ourselves for the mistakes made in the past, and stop worrying about the future. Focus on the present because that's what matters now.) We figure out what we want in order to be happy and let that motivate us. My doctor focussed on saying, this sounds easy BUT it is not. This will take time and effort to achieve, but it'll be worth in the end.

I'm not sure what you want to do but if being a woman can make you happy, at least try that first. Not sure on how it's done."

He said more and more people are slipping into depression because of our environment and modern culture. We just don't see it because depressed people keep it to themselves (and end up being chronically depressed or high function depressed). We constantly compare ourselves to others where we go through trauma (where we fall back a step), or depressed backed up with another disorder like OCD, or anxiety, etc. Once we fall down that hole far enough, it becomes more difficult climb out that hole and we end up in our current state. He also said there are very few people who are happy 90+% of the time, a normal person's mood tend to be cyclical or goes through a wide range of moods. He wishes that depression and other mental illnesses aren't such a stigma in our world. That it is okay to express our emotions and moods instead of hiding it and putting on a mask like everyone else."

This is my personal thought. I am in the same thought as you, I think we cant end it because we still care about being alive. I guess our intuition tells us that there's at least one more thing we need to try we become total apathetic and can finally end it.

Like, there's nothing more that I want is to cease existing. I can end it any time I want but I'm not motivated enough for that yet. The most I can do is search for it while I inch close to being total apathetic. I can say at least I tried but nothing worked, so it's okay that I end it now."
