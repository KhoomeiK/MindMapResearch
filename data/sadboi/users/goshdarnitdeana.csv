90DayFiance,fr0crhm,t1_fqzyebc,1589791034.0,"I was cringing so hard at that part. Pretty sure he probably came a little, and she probably sensed that, lolol."
90DayFiance,fr0ckm7,t3_glgpe9,1589790850.0,"My main beef from this episode is the whole tragedy between Varya, Geoffrey, and Mary. I don‚Äôt really like Mary. She started off being really passive aggressive with the jabs she made at Geoffrey for not initially choosing her. I get that she probably just really has feelings for him, but her vibe kinda came off as really desperate. She deserves better. She‚Äôs overall just too pushy, and allowed herself to be Geoffrey‚Äôs second option when things ‚Äúfell apart‚Äù with Varya. Like, why be so desperate to be with him when it‚Äôs obvious you weren‚Äôt his first choice? Also, why the hell were they still friends if it was obvious that Mary wasn‚Äôt happy with JUST being friends? Especially after all this time? It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs fine with stringing her along, and Mary‚Äôs fine with....waiting, I guess? 

Geoffrey....bro, what else is there to say about him? He took a very rational answer to his proposal as Varya spitting in his face, or some shit. She never even inclined that she didn‚Äôt wanna be in the relationship anymore. She just wanted more time before getting married, AS SHE SHOULD HAVE. I‚Äôm still annoyed at Geoffrey for how childish and passive aggressive he acted about that (among other things). Though, his passive aggressiveness and Mary‚Äôs may make them a match made in hell after all. Also, fuck Geoffrey for using Mary, and fuck him for everything about the Varya situation.

And Varya: to quote the others who‚Äôve already expressed what I was thinking, ‚ÄúOh no, baby, what is you DOING?‚Äù I hope her stuff is just to drum up drama, because I hate seeing her regret her decision to not accept Geoffrey‚Äôs proposal yet, and it‚Äôs obvious that‚Äôs not a man she should be trying to ‚Äúwin‚Äù back. I was cold to Varya at first, but she‚Äôs started growing on me more, and I just hope both her AND Mary find a man way better than him.

Also, Geoffrey conveniently not talking about his last arrest being as recent as LAST YEAR, among his other allegations and all....booooo. He‚Äôs really shady."

She may need therapy or just extra help in general in raising her self-esteem. But, you sound like a grade A bf, and I‚Äôm hoping you two can power through this."
90DayFiance,fqapdur,t1_fqa7wvq,1589222983.0,"I‚Äôll admit that Ash got VERY emotional, and the argument did go off the rails after that. There was no room to say she was being ‚Äúheartless‚Äù. He said that solely out of anger. But, I do feel like they were still able to talk a bit before that. She got to say that she saw Ash getting defensive, and wondered if that was the way he treated people. She got obviously annoyed when he started to get defensive, but I feel like she got her point across. She didn‚Äôt agree with what was said in the seminar, and she felt like Ash was getting really defensive with the women in the audience, and she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that. 

He answered at least some of her questions. At the docks, that was the most they were able to talk, I think. She asked him about if he felt he got his point across, and he answered. She asked him what he meant by that, and he answered. She asked him if he felt defensive toward the woman in the audience, and he answered. He did start to get pretty terse when responding, but he answered some questions, at least. Not saying that was enough, but I don‚Äôt think he didn‚Äôt answer any questions at all. 

But, by the time they got to that point, they were already both pretty pissed off at each other, so there wasn‚Äôt anymore room for any sort of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs agree to disagree‚Äù or anything. I‚Äôm not saying Ash did well. By giving some criticism to Avery, I‚Äôm not saying that she‚Äôs in the wrong and he‚Äôs in the right. I just honestly feel like they both got too amped up to really communicate well anymore. Once they got back to the hotel room, there was nothing else, really. Avery didn‚Äôt wanna take what he said into consideration, and Ash was amping up the drama by calling her heartless and pretending he was about to leave. 

By saying Avery didn‚Äôt wanna take what he said into consideration isn‚Äôt me saying she should just put her feelings aside and coddle Ash, obviously. But, I could kinda see where he‚Äôs coming from when he was talking about feeling unsupported after the seminar. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of time for him to recover from what he said and how the audience reacted. Taking what he said out of the equation, I feel like I would want more support from my partner after a bad presentation, too. There was only a little bit of calm before the storm that came afterwards. 

I think my overall gripe about this is just that I‚Äôm wondering why they decided to really go in about THIS, instead of Ash calling himself single or him obviously trying to hide things. I just feel like this was a weird hill to die on. I do think Avery deserves WAY better, but, like...after all the sketchy shit he‚Äôs said and done, they haven‚Äôt made progress in their storyline just because of the seminar."
90DayFiance,fq92a4y,t1_fq91ro4,1589183030.0,"The whole argument is centered around their clashing ideas. I‚Äôm not sure I understand what you mean when you say he didn‚Äôt let Avery talk at all. Them talking and getting heated is what started the argument. 

At the very least, Avery was able to tell him in that scene by the docks that she doesn‚Äôt believe that what he expressed in the seminar is right. She explained, in her own words, that she felt that masculine and feminine energy didn‚Äôt belong strictly to one gender or another. 

I do hope they either learn how to communicate without getting mad, or break up soon."
90DayFiance,fq8x098,t1_fq8wd7b,1589178036.0,"To be fair, they both started off talking pretty calmly. Avery asked about how he felt the seminar went, and they kinda went back and forth like that for a while. But, it seems like the moment they started going into detail about what he said in the seminar, they started spiraling a bit. 

It was kind of a conversation of, ‚ÄúSo, you said x, y and z in the seminar,‚Äù and Ash was like, ‚ÄúWell, I could‚Äôve said it better, and I felt like I was being misunderstood.‚Äù From there, it went almost straight into, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù and him getting defensive. Which, I‚Äôll leave the politics of it aside. But, generally, people will get defensive at first if they feel like someone‚Äôs calling them wrong.

After that, it feels like there was no more level-headed conversation. They both just kinda believed what they wanted to believe and thought the other person was a lunatic. 

In my opinion, when they got more in depth about what was said, it needed to become a calmer conversation about, ‚ÄúOkay, well, here‚Äôs what I believe. Are we in line with that thinking, or are we not?‚Äù Just put it all out on the table."
90DayFiance,fq8w28h,t3_gh0rv8,1589177207.0,"Also, I‚Äôm uncomfortable and annoyed with Geoffrey guilt-tripping Varya about not wanting to get married yet. Someone more respectful would‚Äôve been like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine! I see your point. Let‚Äôs just remain bf/gf and see where it goes.‚Äù Instead, he just fuckin sulked and made passive aggressive remarks about the whole thing. Good on Varya for standing her ground!"
90DayFiance,fq8vc9b,t1_fq8u7b4,1589176588.0,"I kinda feel like this whole thing could‚Äôve been solved in a calmer manner by Avery saying something like, ‚ÄúHey, I just wanted to be honest with you and let you know I‚Äôm concerned about what you said in the seminar. From what I understood, your views on what roles we play don‚Äôt line up with how I want things to be for us. Am I understanding correctly?‚Äù, or something.

I felt like both of them were already pretty defensive after the seminar, so I feel like there wasn‚Äôt enough space to actually resolve what they were trying to. I feel like Avery stayed very defensive and standoffish, while Ash became pretty emotional and wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly, and was also defensive. They just kept setting each other off. And then, all-in-all, they still never got to the bottom of the issue.

Ultimately, I just still wonder why THIS is the thing they‚Äôre going to war about? I‚Äôd like to think the end could‚Äôve been when Ash slipped up and said that he was single. And all the times he fed her prepackaged ‚Äúrelationship coach‚Äù lines instead of opening up to her."

-David: I‚Äôve just started skipping past his parts, in all honesty. There‚Äôs nothing left to do there. If the crew isn‚Äôt just feeding him the lines necessary to continue his storyline, then he‚Äôs truly delusional. Watching him continuously deny everything that was RIGHT in front of him drove me up a wall.

-Ed and Rose: I‚Äôd been seeing for a while that people were saying that Ed‚Äôs been in the wrong because he sees her as just a foreign play-thing. I didn‚Äôt really catch onto that at first, and I still don‚Äôt know fully how I feel about him. But, I am definitely proud of Rose for standing up for herself. The things he‚Äôd been saying to her would definitely embarrass me, especially in front of a damn camera crew. And wanting kids can definitely be a deal-breaker in some relationships. She seemed pretty fed up by the end of things. I like seeing her speak up more. But, I also don‚Äôt fully know if she‚Äôs just staying with him so her and her son can move to the US or not, either. I really still kinda feel like that. The relationship‚Äôs just kinda weird overall. Rose‚Äôs mannerisms and expressions are kinda off to me, too, but that‚Äôs only in my opinion

-Ash and Avery: I guess I don‚Äôt fully understand what part of Ash‚Äôs seminar upset everyone so much? He was indeed generalizing, but I thought he was just illustrating what traditional roles were with men and women, not enforcing that everyone should be this or that way. Men and women DO think differently. Gender roles have definitely changed, but there are literal differences between how men and women think. I guess I just don‚Äôt fully understand why Avery‚Äôs choosing the seminar, of all sketchy things about Ash, to focus in on. There are so many bigger issues with him. She‚Äôs actually pushing me to side more with Ash on this issue, and I didn‚Äôt see that coming at ALL, especially with him giving her manufactured answers and saying he was ‚Äúsingle‚Äù. Even when they go to talk about it, Avery seems to be ready to jump down his throat about it again instead of listening to him. It was really frustrating for me to watch. There are so many other red flags with Ash. Why focus on that?

-Yolanda: I‚Äôm about on the same page with her as I am about David, honestly. If her lines aren‚Äôt being fed to her ALSO, they‚Äôre literally in the same boat. But, I‚Äôm actually more frustrated with David than her now. At least she seemed to let it sink in a bit that the pictures were fake, if nothing else. David just hasn‚Äôt progressed at all.

-Erika and Stephanie: When I first started watching this season, I was actually more on Stephanie‚Äôs side. I was surprised to see so many people against her. I may have just related more to her because she‚Äôs more withdrawn and sort of seems uncomfortable in her own skin sometimes. I did think the boob cast date would‚Äôve been weird regardless of what kind of person Erika thought she was. It would‚Äôve made me feel weird, too, if I saw that someone had what I thought was a dating app on their phone. Also, it would have ALSO made me feel weird if my person was still good friends with the people he‚Äôs been intimate with before. I am also incredibly insecure, so there‚Äôs that. But, I feel like those were natural things to be a bit put off by. I will say that Stephanie shows herself completely differently online than she does in real life, and Erika even revealed on the show that she‚Äôd been deceitful about what she was and wasn‚Äôt okay with. That‚Äôs definitely shitty. Otherwise, I just see them as polar opposites trying to make the ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù thing work. I‚Äôm fine with both of them to a degree. Warming up more to Erika now, though, too. She‚Äôs got the cutest style and laugh.:)

-Darcey: I‚Äôve seen that she‚Äôs a drama queen and not to be totally trusted in a couple of places, but I‚Äôm rooting for her because she seems to have gotten better about standing up for herself. I‚Äôm living vicariously through her in that, lol!

-Tom: PLEASE get him off the show, for God‚Äôs sake! I‚Äôm tempted to skip his parts, too! That man‚Äôs like a sociopath that doesn‚Äôt have more than, like, one legitimate emotion (if any). Like, his face hardly changes. I wonder if he can experience true joy in anything. And I feel like he jerks off to the compliments he gets on his looks, and it makes me wanna vomit.

(Edit): FORGOT GEOFFREY AND VARYA. Still have mixed feelings about them, too. The whole deal with her potentially using him to get to America was never fully resolved, I don‚Äôt think. But, Geoffrey is also lying about how far back his past goes, and that feels REALLY bad. I don‚Äôt technically remember how much of his criminal history he was found guilty of, but I know he‚Äôs had problems up until LAST YEAR.

(Another edit): OH YEAH, Usman and Lisa! Usman seems like he could be a really nice guy. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he‚Äôs using someone to get to America to further his career, though. Even still, he doesn‚Äôt deserve anything of what he has to go through with Lisa. It seems like NOTHING makes her happy. She complains more than I do, and I‚Äôm pretty surprised by that, lol!"

emetophobia,fnf7f82,t3_g0qm7y,1586902789.0,I actually wanted to add a comment to this post to anyone who looks at this: there‚Äôs this Insta page I follow to look into if a movie or show has v* in it. It‚Äôs called @emetophobiareview. It‚Äôs a really good resource!
emetophobia,fnf79co,t1_fnc2mvj,1586902703.0,"You know, one time, my sister (when I lived with her) was watching this documentary-style tv show on TLC, and the person on the show started  v* with REALLY graphic sounds (if that makes sense). I kept trying to tell my sister to cut it off or change the channel, but she left it and thought it was ridiculous of me to freak out like I did. Was triggered for probably the rest of the day and into the next day. It‚Äôs such a pain when people don‚Äôt take that shit seriously. Some people seem to not be able to understand things outside of their own perspective."
emetophobia,fnf71lw,t1_fnbjipz,1586902589.0,"I can see this, too. Sometimes, I will still be curious about it and may skim through a video to see if it happens without committing to actually watching it.

cscareerquestions,fmyzde1,t1_fmyfmc1,1586500710.0,"Sorry it took me so long to respond! What I mean by abstract thought is, I guess, to be able to more easily put things together in your head or figure out complex tasks. Half the time, I‚Äôm so spaced out, I can‚Äôt even figure out simple tasks, lol. Also, my bf suggested it may be a problem that I‚Äôm not so much of a natural at stuff, but I was the one to actually go, ‚ÄúNah, I suck at this.‚Äù It‚Äôs been a pretty taxing journey, and it feels like hardly anything will stick. Though, I will say that I‚Äôve recently lightened up on how hard I‚Äôve been trying, so that‚Äôs not gonna help. 

Your comment was very reassuring. Thank you so much for that.:) I guess because I‚Äôm around people who are already experienced in it, I can compare myself to them, and so it feels like I‚Äôm a lost cause surrounded by geniuses. I‚Äôll try not to do so much of that in the future. It is still rewarding and cool to me to be able to look into this stuff, honestly.
