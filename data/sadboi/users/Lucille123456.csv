BPD,fjxs8uw,t3_ff519j,1583682137.0,Yes
BPDrecovery,fgw43ve,t1_fgu6b70,1581156583.0,"wow ok :) , 

so it seems that there is a lot of positivity about the structure of the treatment - its great to go into it now with the sort of incentive that this is a positive and proven mode of treating bpd - and learning how to cope and progress - i guess ill have to wait and see how it pans out - I start later this month :)"
BPDrecovery,fgw3j4g,t1_fgtkjhj,1581156311.0,"Thank you so much for that very informative message ! 

yes it sounds like im going into the same format of MBT thearpy but the initial 12 weeks is group based , then it goes onto one to one 

you have covered a lot of my concerns , especially in terms of 'fitting into' the group, or what pre conceptions i would have about what the group dynamic should be - appose to the reality of what it is as a learning experience. thank you also for flagging the importance to balance out the venting and look towards the learning aspect of the group and the course- sometimes it can be natural to slip into a vent but its really helpful you have pointed this out :). 

I think your right , the course is so new so going into it can have some pre conceptions about maybe it being more of a traditional group therapy setting  , or like you said - something like a AA meeting - but its important to know that it isnt structured in the same way - which I think is really quite interesting and sort of a tailored approach thank you for clearing that up

I am a bit worried about shutting down or silencing myself in the group- but i guess thats normal 

what is the homework like ? or am i prying too much (still very curious)

anyway - Im so glad that MBT helped you so much - its always great to hear a success story - there always so motivating /i feel a bit more encouraged :)"

BPD,f94wy3r,t1_f94pibm,1575107941.0,Twenty four hours is exactly it - I listened to that song on repeat when I first heard it ! Such a song that resides well with this state of mind
BPD,f94wvom,t3_e3u03w,1575107835.0,This sounds like it’s a distorted thought pattern  and it’s not true
communism,f8atsks,t3_dzsj5s,1574411514.0,What do you usually read ?
communism,f8atl4u,t1_f7nhahv,1574411211.0,I second your comments and think it would be important to expand the mega threads/  according to places of particular increased injustices - I think it’s important to put special interest in more areas /  esp in Latin America/ I’m also writing this message to ask if you have any info on women’s resistance groups I could research - where there’s a strong presence of women’s uprising  in Latin America — either historic or present (obviously whilst being aware if they need protection atm)   ? I ask as I have recently been reading a book on a group of Argentinian cyberfeminists that’s  quite interesting and I’m interested in women’s uprisings generally
BPD,f8asi0z,t1_f88f7gb,1574409640.0,I think that’s it isn’t it / because this isn’t a “normal” experience with sex  - because “healthy” sexual relationships are supposedly natural etc etc - we internalise this/ use it as another strategy to make us feel isolated - and think that 1. It’s our fault and that we’re bad and we will always feel this way and 2. We forget that this might actually be connected to a pattern of learnt behaviours / tactics of thinking and feelings built on - from the experience with bpd
BPD,f88cn4w,t1_f86rboe,1574352432.0,honestly im so glad i stumbled across this thread - its ringing so true to my expereince too/ its easy to think that its a individual and internalised issue - which it is but also to a extent it is re inforced by this illness too and is something we collectivley expereince
mentalhealth,f886nos,t3_dzfczi,1574349495.0,"yup - i feel you, what hurts the most is how much it is a reflection of how little we value ourselves and our right to participate in conversations or social interactions /"
