He’d start sawing and I’d make the pig squeak in fear. Toddler stops sawing and in the sweetest voice says “it’s okay piggie, it’s okay.” As soon as the piggy calmed down he gets this devilish look in his eyes and starts sawing again laughing maniacally.

I realize this would probably take some kind of moderator scanning worldwide news to keep the sites of active protests accurate.

At this stage in my life, I want to build at least a year or two of trust with someone before I’ll even consider defining him as a boyfriend. I feel like, if he’s worth committing to (no matter the age), we’ll be able to communicate openly about this and he’ll listen and respect my boundary to take the time to get to know and trust each other, and if he can enjoy the relationship for what it is and let things develop naturally that’ll go a long way towards showing that he’s not gonna be possessive or controlling which is important to a lot of women."
