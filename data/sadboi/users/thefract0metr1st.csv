The10thDentist,fpdcwma,t3_gcl0jy,1588524514.0,"I don’t think EDM has more potential to create more diverse sounds than traditional instruments, it’s just a lot easier. The reason I picked up a guitar was because I heard the song Guerrilla Radio by rage against the machine right after it was released, and shortly afterward found out that solo was a guitar... I originally thought it was a saxophone or some sort of horn instrument. Computers make everything easier... it takes a lot more creativity to make a guitar sound like a saxophone than it does to just load up a saxophone preset on a software synth. I love using computers because it makes it easier to find unique sounds, but it’s also more satisfying to me as creative minded person to take the hard road and make unique sounds with a guitar. 

I think the reason EDM comes off as bland is because every time some one comes up with a interesting new style that breaks through to the mainstream, suddenly everyone copies it verbatim. It’s not bland though... it evolves faster than any other kind of music. Skrillex made dubstep for a few years and then started producing all kinds of different artists in different genres... does he even make dubstep anymore? I honestly don’t know because I don’t really follow him but my point is that everyone just associates him with dubstep (and vice versa) when he’s a whole hell of a lot more than that... he just happened to make some music that made him near-ubiquitous and now that’s all anyone who isn’t a fan of his associates him with."

I’ve spent the years thinking about it but trying not to think about it too hard... I have bipolar disorder and I’ve already had a manic episode since this time where my mom said I sounded like a cult leader and like I thought I was the second coming of Jesus. Obviously, I take my disorder into account... a person having a manic episode does not make a great leader for very long, and having masses of people hanging on your every word can definitely trigger a manic episode in those who are already pre disposed to it. 

It’s also worth mentioning that this woman does not remember anything she says during these sessions. She makes recordings of every session but mine... disappeared. I never got to listen to it after the original session. 

A couple years ago, I saw this woman again in a group session that ended with her giving each person there a personal message. She did not recognize me at all but she told me “Michael gave you a sword... he says you’re supposed to use it.”"

These drugs *are* life changing, but there’s a reason why many medications require prescriptions from licensed professionals - if people with anxiety issues had unlimited access to Xanax or Valium, there would be a LOT of negative repercussions.

I’ve done a lot of psychedelics - they have changed my life for the better and the worse simultaneously. I strongly advocate for the use of psychedelics but I also strongly warn people not to do them the way I have... that is to say, in reckless amounts and with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. These stupid, reckless decisions may have saved my life, warding off suicidal thoughts and given me a reason to live, while also driving me crazy - had I been given the opportunity to do this with a professional psychotherapist, I’m confident that the negative effects I’ve experienced would be significantly diminished."

When I was 22 I went through a 6 month period of snorting Xanax and adderall, in sometimes stupid amounts. The kind of thing where you know you’re being stupid and reckless as it’s happening but you just don’t care - but things have a tendency to pop up in life and give people reasons to care. These kinds of situations are brutal cycles that can be difficult to break - some never do - but no one is a lost cause because there is always the potential for something to come along and give you a good reason to care. 

If drugs are your thing, hallucinogens taken with the proper mindset can be a good thing - bad trips also have the potential to scare people into making a change.

Is my life better because of all this? Who’s to say? My life is still a life though. Some moments feel better than others. All are obstacles that can theoretically be overcome. Obviously there’s no magical cure for bipolar, we don’t just “get over it”, but in my experience, trying to adopt that attitude (that we can just “get over it”) makes things more manageable over time. Thinking of this as illness, no matter how correct that assessment may be, puts me in the wrong mindset... it reminds me that bad things will NEVER stop happening to me in relation to bipolar.

ToolBand,f85aci8,t3_dz4it7,1574271025.0,"It hasn’t ruined music for me exactly, but I tend to go through phases of what I’m predominantly listening to. For example, I’ll listen to heavy metal and Tool for a few months, then it will switch to hip hop and Tool for a few months, followed by electronica and Tool."
ToolBand,f7tvi6d,t3_dxm3vk,1574008072.0,"I think it varies based on your perception - to me, the darkest is easily Opiate and each release gets progressively less dark, with Fear Inoculum being their least dark."
ToolBand,f7tuu7e,t1_f7tsix6,1574007883.0,That would explain the extended technical difficulties he was having on Halloween
Cringetopia,f7rwm3v,t1_f7rqbvd,1573988337.0,"I was just gonna say... when I was 7 my family computer didn’t have the internet. I believe that was the year my parents gifted us with a CD Rom drive for the family computer. It was a couple years after my dad convinced my mom to buy a computer, because “this has a 486 MHz processor... we won’t have to upgrade for 10 years!”"
Coffee,f7piq7r,t3_dwe6a6,1573949887.0,"I’ve only tried their coffee once - it was a Costa Rican (can’t remember the exact region/farm) white honey process and it was really tasty - a top 10 for me, and I’ve tried a LOT of different coffees."
thatHappened,f7niow8,t3_dx5ye8,1573905730.0,"I used to be one of the few metal head in a school surrounded by classmates listening to garbage pop and auto tuned rap, and I used to try doing this in hopes it would convert people’s music tastes. It worked successfully a grand total of zero times."
bipolar,f7280a5,t3_du4o3l,1573355342.0,This is so beautifully descriptive. From walking on water to drowning in it within an instant.
bipolar,f71edjv,t3_du2yrb,1573340230.0,"When both my paternal grandma and maternal grandpa died, I felt similarly. I was very close to both of them, and both of them died after suffering for a long time (my grandpa had emphysema and my grandma beat breast cancer and skin cancer before succumbing to lung cancer) so it felt like being happy that they no longer had to suffer canceled out the loss. Both times I got very introspective and philosophical about death and grief. I never felt sadness - this concerned me because I felt sadness and depression over the loss of pets in the past, and I wondered why it felt different. I still don’t know. It such a strange feeling."
ToolBand,f70klv3,t3_dtoak8,1573329457.0,One of these was in my seat in Milwaukee. I saw dozens of them sitting in seats that were yet to be occupied.
ToolBand,f6yxoa7,t1_f6yih4q,1573302915.0,There is a trick to avoiding this: only go to Tool concerts.
ToolBand,f6yxlee,t3_dtra90,1573302814.0,"I was 15 when Tool came to my city right after Lateralus was released and I told my dad I wanted to go see them for my first concert and so we each bought a ticket and he took me. That’s when my dad became a Tool fan. Such an incredible time, only matched by last week when I got to see them for the second time, this time with my brother. Such a incomparable experience."
ToolBand,f6ov2t6,t1_f6m8tkt,1573036584.0,"I was getting fucking anxiety just reading this, the whole time thinking “but you got your poster, right? This story is gonna end happy, right? RIGHT?!”"
Coffee,f6dfhg9,t1_f6dbcte,1572793809.0,"Sometimes I just put them straight in the container out of the roaster - I work as a coffee roaster. I have 3 containers - if they all currently have some coffee in it and I have something else I’m wanting to try, I seal it up in a bag and transfer it to the container when the container is empty. Each container has a top/cap that you push down to push the air out, that also allows for degassing."
Coffee,f6cm63g,t1_f6bcy20,1572786743.0,"It’s only airtight before you cut it open. Most people probably won’t notice a difference after a month when comparing between and open bad and airtight container, but it’s definitely better to store it in air tight container after opening the bag, at least if you’re a flavor obsessed freak like me."
Coffee,f69r3e6,t1_f69omn3,1572745907.0,"I typically take 20-30 mins to drink a full cup, but I start sipping immediately after it’s poured. The first half of the cup takes me about 15-20 mins and the second half takes 5-10 mins because I start gulping it once it’s cool. That’s just my preference though - my girlfriend sometimes takes over an hour, and she’ll reheat it several times in the microwave. 

The point, your body is going to process it differently depending on how you drink it and how concentrated with caffeine it is. Everyone has a different body that is going to react differently as well - some are more sensitive to caffeine even in comparison to those with no tolerance.

It’s not necessarily bad to drink coffee the way you do, as long as you aren’t experiencing negative effects from it."
Cringetopia,f69p48g,t3_dqtggq,1572745075.0,I’m offended by the phrase “bring home the bacon” because I feel like it’s derogatory to police officers and blue lives matter.
Coffee,f69hmqc,t1_f69b91b,1572741972.0,"Totally okay, I use the exact same container"
Coffee,f69awf9,t3_dqsjlu,1572739475.0,Airtight container is always best - light and oxygen are the main things that degrade flavor.
Coffee,f69am2w,t3_dqsq8g,1572739327.0,"Typically, 5 shots of espresso is roughly a 16-20 oz cup of regular coffee. The amount of time it takes you to drink it is going to have an effect too... drinking 5 shots of espresso in 5-10 mins is going to hit you harder than taking a half an hour to drink a big cup of coffee."
ToolBand,f6983my,t3_dqkqru,1572737775.0,"This is freaky... I took this exact same photo on my phone, just zoomed out a little.

ToolBand,f697tc4,t1_f66r74k,1572737563.0,"If it came down to tickets or paying rent, I’d be fucking homeless."
ToolBand,f697567,t1_f68qvqp,1572737078.0,Idk if you cheat or steal but you definitely lie.
