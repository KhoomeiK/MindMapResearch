I don't open up to people at all about my condition, I told 2 friends only and they made very very long guy of it then even belittled it, I was devastated that I regret sharing it anymore, now I don't at all, just anonymously."

But seeing your response, it made me realise otherwise, so have you also learned Arabic there ? And can you retain from it? Like have basic conversations ?"

schizophrenia,eqtyhy3,t3_bzn68b,1560321833.0,"Hey there u/SchizoCakes
First of all, I would like to remind you that you are not alone in this, so don't feel isolated. I had the same experience when I told close people about my condition of schizophrenia, some of them behaved badly and some were very kind and endearing. So it's just a matter of people fondness of you.
And sorry to tell you this, but your online mate/boyfriend is a jerk and you need to breakup with him as soon as possible, they way he treats you is not acceptable and not excused at all, his behaviour is just outright jerk.
And I am not a fan of disclosing schizophrenia for people who are close to me, it works as an effective speel to weed off the bad/fake people from your life 
I advice you that when you get in a relationship again, you state that out to your partner clearly, it will show their true colours, but just wait a couple of days to say that, don't let it take too long.

And it's weird that you never video called or at least snapped back, next time due that, to check if the other person is catfishing or not.

And if you need to talk about those you always have this amazing subreddit and us the Redditor to talk.
This community have been so much helpful to me."
