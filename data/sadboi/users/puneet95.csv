Imagine the riots and when you try sterilize a particular community. And it's not like China is being spared of their actions. US has been trying to hurt them. It is way easier to hurt India of it's actions than China. We simply can't go the Chinese route on this one because we are not a manufacturing superpower like China. They have got the world hooked to their cheap and quality manufacturing. We simply don't have that much clout on the world stage to pull something like this off. And then not to forget the internal threats we have.

Any non peaceful way to solve this problem will invite a lot of Paki and Leftist propaganda. The only way to solve this problem is by reforming Quran, madrasas and mosques. It is time when we see madrasas and mosques as enemy territories. There is always a godfather that instructs Muslims to carry out these riots and chaos. That's where our men need to be. We need our men to run Islamic institutions in India. The reason why Muslims behave the way the behave is because of of the instructions that have been feed to them by the Imams. That is the root cause of all this radicalism. And that is why we need spies/fake imams at the mosques, madrasas and islamic institutions like AMU, Jamia."

Lmao with around almost 50 Islamic countries, you chose ONE non Muslim country to justify your claims?! Let me give you data on what Muslim majority countries think about homosexuality.

A overwhelming majority of Muslims in all the Islamic countries believe that homosexuality is immoral!

[https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-morality/](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-morality/)

And then deflection again, why are we even talking about all of this and comparing ourselves to developing countries when our topic of discussion was fascism in Pakistan!

When it comes to NRC, I am with you, it is really costly and poor Muslims don't have documents to prove their citizenship. 

I find it astonishing on how can a Trans be against CAA. CAA is all about stopping Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Afghani Muslims from entering India ILLEGALLY!

Let me re-frame that once again for you:

CAA is all about stopping Trans haters from entering a country where it legal to be Trans! And here we have a Trans taking sides with Trans haters!

Watching a Trans like you go against CAA is like watching a chicken fighting to keep KFC alive!

Genuinely asking though: Why would a Trans get triggered by a post that has rational reasons to hate Pakistan and one of the reasons to hate them is on how they treat transgenders?! Why would a Trans defend a country where 90% people think homosexuality is immoral?!"
religiousfruitcake,fnrjgzw,t1_fnoja6y,1587190880.0,"> What the nationalists of either countries seem to believe that India or Pakistan is a superior country with superior people respectively to Indian and Pakistani nationalists. 

There are different reasons why both of them feel superior to each other.

Pakistanis feel superior because they think Muslims are superior to idol worshipers/Hindus. You can't blame them, it's their holy book that teaches them this shit. This doesn't end here, they think they ruled India for 1000 years, that's why they are superior. But that's not the case, it's the Persians/Turks who ruled the country and shoved Islam down the throat of the ancestors of the present day Muslims in the subcontinent! Don't believe me? Almost every Islamic ruler that ruled the subcontinent had a guy along side him who would just keep a log of his warfare and other major activities, just read those books, you'll find incredible amount of Hindu hatred in those books.

Most of the Indians generally don't feel superior, but the ones that do is because of achievements and advances in science and technology. Yes, I know we are miles behind developed countries, but we are miles ahead of Pakistan. That's not the only reason, we are literally the spiritual capital of the planet, India is home of yoga and meditation. Whereas Pakistan is home is fascism and terrorism. Majority of the UN designated terrorist organisations are from Pakistan and that is exactly why they are in the FATF grey list. 

So to sum it up, Pakistan feels superior because of the Hindu hatred in their holy book, Indians feel superior because of what we have given back to the world, that is science, technology and spirituality.

Have you noticed how all major democracies over the world have been going through polarization, but authoritarian countries like Islamic countries, Russia and China aren't going through polarization?! That's because liberals went a bit too far in these free democratic countries.

What do I mean by a bit too far? So I have a theory on this, I might be wrong, but please do read this and correct me if I am wrong.

You know, how feminism was supposed to be about women empowerment, equality and freedom. But instead a good initiative like feminism took a wrong turn and women started hating ALL men, they started promoting women as victims and men as bully. Some even started using feminism as a victim card to get out situations where women were clearly wrong. Hence, the term, feminazi came into existence. Obviously, not all men are bad, not all women are feminazi.

Similarly liberalism, secularism were supposed to be about equality and freedom to practice all religions. But just like feminism, secularism took a wrong turn too. And just like how feminism became about pro women and anti men, and just like how feminism got infected with bully-victim narrative, similarly secularism got got infected by that and took a wrong turn. And then this flawed version of secularism where people see minority as victims all the time and completely ignore the deaths of Hindus by the hands of Muslims angered many Hindus who were actually following real secularism. Hence those people got pushed to the right wing. 

And then just like how deluded feminists who push victim-bully narrative and refrain from criticizing bad women are called feminazis, similarly deluded liberals like you and many more like Ravish Kumar, Kunal Kamra, Dhruv Rathee, Swara Bhaskar are called libtards, librandu, pseudo-liberals, sickulars etc! Kunal Kamra even admitted that he has pro Muslim bias in his latest podcast!

These aren't few people, this is a massive ecosystem of people who simply don't want to criticize bad Muslims. If you are going to refrain from criticizing bad Muslims, Hindus will get scared, and then they will look for a messiah, and that is exactly what they found inform of Modi, a messiah.

And then there is another anti Muslim ecosystem too, which includes people like Arnab Goswami, Sudhir Chaudhary. Once again I am denying that bhakts don't exist, I have a few in my family too, but how are you gonna convince the bhakts to join the secularism boat when you yourself aren't following true secularism!

One ecosystem doesn't want to criticize bad Muslims and one ecosystem doesn't want to criticize the bad Hindus. Hence the polarization!

If you would have been genuine liberal, you would have criticized the religion which stands against the very liberal ideas you believe in, but as you are following a flawed version of liberalism, you will keep criticizing Hindus and the majority. Please see that it completely okay to criticize bad Hindus. It's bias and deflection when bad Muslims are criticized is what creates rift between us.

This happened in all the major democracies around the world, that is why right wing nationalism is rising in all these countries and in India. And because authoritarian and fascist countries like Islamic countries and China squash any other ideology with hammer, you won't find polarization in these countries. In fact these countries have been far right and fascist from day one. That is why you will never see a non Muslim celebrity from Muslim country and non Han celebrity from China."
religiousfruitcake,fnrj9c7,t1_fnoja6y,1587190686.0,"You sound incredibly deluded and biased. Your comment is full of whataboutism and deflection!

Why are you pointing out issues of our country when it has got nothing to do with our relations with Pakistan? But yes, I do agree with all those issues in our country. But none of those issues are relevant when we are talking about our relations with Pakistan.

You know what, I used to think like you, that, it's the Pakistan army/government that is bad, not the people. But that's not case. If Pakistanis would have been good people, they would have been out on the roads, protesting, on why are their minorities treated so badly. They would be protesting on why are 1000+ Hindu girls are converted every year. Pakistanis are so deluded that they were out on roads to show solidarity with Deepika Padukone, but they'll never protest on why are the minorities of Pakistan being cleansed! And that's not the case in India.

Also, if Pakistanis are good then why is that one can't name a single Hindu celebrity from Pakistan?! That's because a Hindu can't flourish in Pakistan, that's how fascist is Pakistan!

I don't hate Pakistan on the basis of their nationality, it's their actions, mentality and behavior that makes me hate them. There support for terrorist organistions, gazwa-e-hind narrative and many fascist narratives that they derive from their so called holy book.

If general Pakistani populace would have been liberal, then they would have been out on the roads protesting on why are Hindus, Shias, Ahmediyas, Christians being killed! Can you name me one such protest? Can you name me some kind of a movement or an organisation that good Muslims run to protect the minorities?

When a Pakistani called India fascist on reddit, I asked him, dude, your people commit ethnic cleansing of 10,000+ people every year. I even gave the sources and links. And guess what, I was banned from the Pakistani sub! Banned by so called good Pakistanis!

For once I thought you are Indian Muslim, but I don't think you are one. Because Muslims don't care about LGBT rights, as there is death penalty for gays in Islam.    You are one those guys from Kunal Kamra clan who doesn't like Islam/Muslims being criticized. And that's why instead of countering my facts, you started deflecting by pointing out issues in our country. Typical. But yes, those were legit issues, not gonna deny that. 

But what is really astonishing here is that you compared a country (Pakistan) where homosexuality is illegal to India where homosexuality is legal! Once again it's their holy book to be blamed here, because that doesn't permit homosexuality! 

> Both countries have problems of terrible treatment of minorities. 

Not gonna deny that. But we 100 times better than Pakistan when it comes to treatment of minorities. Here are few things which minority in India can do, but minority in Pakistan will never be able to do:

1. Imagine, a Pakistani Muslim leaves Islam, joins Hinduism and then wins Oscar in his career?! Forget about his career, his life would be over as soon as he quits Islam, as there is death penalty for quitting Islam (A.R Rahman)
2.  Imagine, a Pakistani Hindu becoming 3rd richest Pakistani (Asim Premji) 
3. Imagine, a Pakistani Hindu becoming world's richest actor (SRK)
4. Imagine, Pakistanis listening to bhajans every day on loud speakers from temples, 5 times a day, starting early morning! Never ever gonna happen!
5. Imagine Pakistan giving subsidy from their budget to Hindus for pilgrimage

The thing is, in our country bad things happen to Muslims but good things also happen to Muslims, we have a big list of bad things and a big list of good things, we have Muslims who have made India proud, but in Pakistan, only bad things happen, Pakistanis have nothing to celebrate about the successes of their Hindus, their good list is not only small but empty!

And then don't forget ethnic cleansing of 10,000+ non sunni muslims in Pakistan every year. 

Another thing that is astonishing here is that how Shia Muslims are safer in India then in Pakistan, a country created in the name of Islam. Lol. 

So, India is miles, miles ahead of Pakistan when it comes to minority rights, I find it astonishing on how can someone even compare the two! And this isn't the only parameter on which your comparison was absurd and naive, there were other stupid comparisons too! But obviously you had to do these silly, stupid comparisons to deflect as you couldn't counter my facts. 

Here's a list of all the hate crimes by Muslims: [https://twitter.com/ARanganathan72/status/1146393391854264321](https://twitter.com/ARanganathan72/status/1146393391854264321) 

And then there are so many more cases of Hindus being killed by Muslims in UP, Kerala, Bengal.  

Another important twitter thread that you must check out: [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/831371283229126656.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/831371283229126656.html) 

All of the above points don't matter to me much, what really boggles my mind is how did the liberals of country ended up having pro Muslim bias? Your pro Muslim bias is so strong that you couldn't accept the rational reasons I gave against Pakistan!

You guys (Kunal Kamra, Dhruv Rathee and many many more) stand for liberal values (which even I do), but at the same time you want to defend one of the most fascist ideologies on the planet?! That is Islam?

You want to support LGBT, but do Muslim appeasement? Appeasement of a community that wants homosexuals dead? Why this hypocrisy?

Islam literally stands against the very ideas and liberal values we both believe in, yet you guys fail to criticize them and hold them responsible?

Islam is against minority rights. Islam is against LGBT rights. Islam is against democracy. Islam is against free speech. Look at the history of Islam, wherever there has been Islam, that country has been fascist!

1. Parsis ran away from Iran

2. Pandits ran way from Kashmir

3. Hindus ran away from Pakistan

4. Ahmediyyas ran away from Pakistan

5. Hindus ran away from Bangladesh, their Hindu population dropped from 15% to 7%

6. Jews ran away from middle east Islamic countries 

What's common in these countries? ISLAM!

Muslims in majority means guaranteed fascism and ethnic cleansing!

Which means more the percentage of Muslims in country more chances of that country becoming fascist

So, it is safe to say that number of Muslims in a society is directly proportional to fascism in the society.

Are all Muslims bad? NO! But good Muslims have a very poor record when it comes prevention of a ethnic cleansing! And that is exactly why CAA has been brought in. So, that Bangladeshis Muslims don't come to our country ILLEGALLY, and we have less Muslims in country. See, bad Hindus exist too, I know that violence against Muslims have increased significantly since BJP came to power in 2014, but good Hindus are always there to protest and protect innocent Muslims. But that's not the case when Hindus are victims!"

religiousfruitcake,fnnwzyq,t1_fnnvppy,1587104358.0,"lol what?! Pakistan isn't a race. And we have rational reasons to hate Pakistan. They are literally one of the most fascist countries on the planet! 

Pakistan runs 100s of UN designated terrorist organisations. There is a reason why they are in the grey list of FATF. Even their best friend China didn't vote in favour of them! Not to forget the terrorist attacks they have carried out on our soil like 26/11, Pulwama, Pathankot and funding jihadis in Kashmir.

And here are some rational reasons why Pakistan is fascist and why we Indians hate them:

1. Pakistani schools teach Hindu hatred:

[https://www.dawn.com/news/672000/pakistan-schools-teach-hindu-hatred](https://www.dawn.com/news/672000/pakistan-schools-teach-hindu-hatred)

2. 1000+ non muslim girls are forcefully converted and married off. They can't leave Islam after converting, as there is death penalty for apostasy!

[https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/08/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-report/](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/08/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-report/)

3. 1000+ Shia muslims are killed every year in Pakistan! 23,000 since 1963!

[https://youtu.be/KjdsKVRAbPU](https://youtu.be/KjdsKVRAbPU)

4. Pakistani constitution has anti Ahmediyya laws in place, which says that Ahmediyyas are not muslims.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-religion/pakistans-ahmadi-community-releases-damning-persecution-report-idUSKBN1HZ06R](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-religion/pakistans-ahmadi-community-releases-damning-persecution-report-idUSKBN1HZ06R)

5. Many Ahmediyyas flew to Nepal because of the persecution

6. Here we have Pakistani PM Imran Khan himself saying that their army has been committing genocide on Balochis!

[https://twitter.com/navneet\_mundhra/status/1168770123412340737?s=20](https://twitter.com/navneet_mundhra/status/1168770123412340737?s=20)

7. 629 Christian girls were sold to China. There is a reason why non muslim girls are being sold!

[https://apnews.com/c586d0f73fe249718ec06f6867b0244e](https://apnews.com/c586d0f73fe249718ec06f6867b0244e)

8. 5000 Hindus leave Pakistan every year to go to India!

[https://www.dawn.com/news/1105830](https://www.dawn.com/news/1105830)

9. Pakistan accused of dumping over 1000 bodies of Balochis

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38454483](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38454483)

10. Not to forget that they have names their nuclear missiles after genocidal maniacs who butchered and massacred millions of Hindus. That's like Germany naming their missiles after Hitler and then asking Israel/Jews for peace and friendship.

11. Another fun fact: One can name Muslim celebrities from India, but one can't name Hindu celebrities from Pakistan. The only time a Hindu gets famous in Pakistan is when a Hindu girl is abducted and forcefully converted!

With ethnic cleansing of 10,000+ non sunni muslims every how can one call Pakistan a peaceful country?! It boggles my mind how Pakistan isn't called a fascist country! No other country on the planet commits ethnic cleansing of 10,000+ people every year!"
