FFVIIRemake,fnqq09b,t1_fnplrae,1587169703.0,"I don't think they should cross, but I'm worried that they will because Nomura is still in charge. He always likes to inject his needlessly confusing concepts into everything. What people might not be thinking about is that Nomura could possibly add more confusing stuff than just the Whispers and Fate spirits. Thats mostly why I'm worried, that part 2 is gonna end up like KH2; Nomura has a strong start with part 1, or KH1, but then fucks it all up by needlessly making part 2, or KH2, more confusing and complicated than it should."
FFVIIRemake,fnp2e6u,t1_fnospu9,1587138034.0,"Its much simpler actually. By destroying the Arbiter of Fate, they've basically opened up new timelines. Zack living is another timeline that doesn't affect the current timeline with Cloud and Co leaving Midgar. There's also another timeline where Biggs lives and gets taken to the Four Leaf House in Sector 5.

How timelines work in this game is like Avengers Endgame, not Back to the Future. Just because Zack lives, doesn't mean the current timeline can't happen, it just means a new timeline, a new alternate reality, was created; a reality where Zack lived and went back to Aerith and maybe trained Cloud as a SOLDIER. No, Zack isn't being teased as alive in this current timeline. The rain scene with Aerith feeling the rain as Zack walks past is a nod to the ending of Crisis Core where Aerith could sense that Zack died through the planet pouring rain over her in the church while Zack was bleeding out outside Midgar."
FFVIIRemake,fncko5t,t1_fnavyvx,1586839210.0,"I understood what was happening.

Basically, the Whispers were some entities tied to the Planet basically making sure that everything that Cloud and Co does is in line with the Planets plans or Destiny (in terms of writing, this means the Whispers are a narrative excuse to keep the Remakes plot in line with the original, minus some of the new elements like Roche). By the end, the Whispers finally reveal to us that Sephiroth has been manipulating behind-the-scenes, and corrupting Destiny so that he can win this time, hence why the theory that he's ""from the future"" is popping up. This is why I hated that alternate timelines are being introduced. That's why 1) Zack lives and walks back to Midgar in the final shot of the game, and 2) everytime you kill one of the Fate Arbiters or whatever they're called, they flash Clouds mind with a vision of the possible future (or basically the OG plot of 7).

The meaning behind the Arbiter of Fates destruction now means that things are going to be diverging from the original plot; that's why the end card is """"The UNKNOWN JOURNEY will continue"" because now Nomura and Nojima have a narrative excuse to make a new plot, like Aerith not dying, or Sephiroth winning, or someone else dying.

Because I understood all of this, I hate the ending much more. They used the Whisper bullshit to excuse themselves, the writers, to make their own story, meaning that the themes will probably change. If they wanted to make a new story, then make a new game, why present a Remake when it's actually a Reboot, or a soft one at that? Really, the only thing thats making me want part 2 is gameplay and combat. Story-wise, I'm out. Fuck Nomura, his writing is the worst and needlessly complex to make himself seem like a deep thinker, when really he's just a try-hard."
FFVIIRemake,fn9ni2w,t1_fn9m0e9,1586779374.0,"Yeah, I know. Sorry, I just finished the game a few minutes ago and I was absolutely fuming. I only blame Nomura because the concepts of ""Fate and Destiny"" are themes pulled straight from Kingdom Hearts. Nojima was also the writer for the original FF7 but at the time Kitase was also the co-writer; Kitase, imo, had a better understanding of Final Fantasy stories better than Nojima.

I still stand by what I said, these concepts are pulled straight from KH and Nomuras mind. He's a director, and directors and writers usually work closely, especially if they have history together, as is the case with both Nomura and Nojima (KH 1-3, Advent Children). Nojima probably took notes from Nomura and ran with the whole Destiny bullshit as a narrative excuse to present to us, the players, that things are going to be changing and fate is not gonna tie this remakes plot one-to-one with the original. Meaning, the writers are free to do whatever and change things as they see fit because this isn't a remake anymore, its a reboot being excused as an alternate timeline. That's the laziest writing excuse in the history of storytelling; so few can actually make alternate timeline plots seem interesting (Dan Harmon, Chris Nolan)."
FFVIIRemake,fn9ldx3,t3_fy1yiz,1586777346.0,"I only have one thing to say: Nomura needs to stop inserting dumb and needlessly confusing plots in this game. That was dumbest shit I've ever seen. I did not like that ending one bit. 

MULTIPLE TIMELINES?!?! 

In a game that is mostly about the cycle of life and death, Nomura definitely doesn't understand the story of the original. God, this is fucking frustrating. I'm all for change and adjustments, like making Jessie and co. have more personality and screen time, the addition of Roche, all of these are good additions and changes. But fucking hell, TIMELINES?!?! I get it, FF7 does have some mix of sci-fi, but no one expected any of this.

My only hope now, especially with the implication of destroying the ""ArBiTrR oF F@te"" (most asinine, Kingdom Hearts-esque bullshit name I've ever heard that shouldn't be in FF7) that maybe now those stupid ""WhSpErS"" aren't gonna make things even more confusing. This might meam that the plot is gonna change dramatically, like maybe Aerith not dying and the Meteor being shattered before hitting Midgar, but fucking hell, I've always hated Nomura and his writing and this game only deepened that feeling."

A good narrative excuse would be if the M9 just tells Essek of what happened, Matt says that the Dynasty will take over to contain the Obann threat and in the meantime, the M9 will pay up on those favors they have for Essek. This'd be good for natural progression for the group to level up, get stronger stuff. It'll be sort of a lul in the larger story, but it's for the best."
Borderlands,f1o9k73,t3_da3bb5,1569638401.0,"The problem I have with Mayhem is that my modifiers contradict themselves. I would a modifier of ""+50% damage on pistols, etc.; -50% damage on assault rifles and sniper rifles"", then just below that, ""+50% damage on assault rifles and sniper rifles""; ""-50% damage on pistols, etc."". Then all of a sudden, ""-50% to all gun damage"".

WHAT?! Did they even test this? It's not Mayhem, it's confusing."
criticalrole,f1lydu3,t1_f1lusd7,1569576070.0,"I like it too. I'm sure Matt had already planned for Lorenzo, or Avantika to be the main baddies, but since M9 get away with so much, this episode was refreshing because the M9 actually take a big loss other than a character death. Their mission failed because of poor planning, they didn't get Yasha, Obann got away again, and they're back to square one."
criticalrole,f1ly8cz,t1_f1lxdoe,1569575830.0,"It was a perception check on Nott, because Sam did state that he wanted to ""cut the sling of the bag"" or something along those lines, not steal the thing from the bag directly. Since Obann was flying, I think Matt's call for a perception check was fair, and of course Obann would've had to roll his perception check as well, assuming his passive perception wasn't already high."
criticalrole,f1ly0bj,t1_f1lxtt4,1569575491.0,"My running theory is that Fjord was contesting Obanns control, because, I think, that Obann actually has no control over the beasts that he plans to summon. So, Obann's just using a Charm on the demons just like anyone else. Iirc, Charm spells have no limited reach."
criticalrole,f1lrgna,t3_d9wb3j,1569565247.0,"Fjord was great in this. That clutch charm on the Laughing Hand helped IMMENSELY, that might've saved the M9 from a death. But yeah tho, Obann escaping sucks, but that was the best scenario they could've gotten, otherwise, if they stayed, M9 could've died then and there.

Sidenote: this was my first live episode after getting caught up yesterday. Damn, that was rough, and now we have to wait 2 weeks?! Damn it."

AskReddit,eyxubgx,t3_cz6fi1,1567562729.0,"Disney Remakes. At least with most Marvel movies, we're seeing something new with new characters and interesting plots. These recent Disney remakes of classic animations serve nothing. They're not improvements over animation (which is still a stigma to the general audience that animation is cheaper than live action), nothing new is being done in terms of direction because most of these movies just try to recreate scenes from the animations.

They're a waste of time and I can't believe people are eating this shit up. The Lion King 2019 somehow made $1B internationally, ffs."

Other than that? Moze has the better skill trees, at least to me. Her skill tree is basically the power of Gunzerker with the gun-centric passive abilities of Commando. Plus, there's a point in one of the trees that Iron Bear gains autopilot, so that's also a plus for me. Moze has the best look imo; I've always liked Vladof and her look really sells it for me."
