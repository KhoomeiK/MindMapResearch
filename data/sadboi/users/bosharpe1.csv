Look at it this way though - (And I'm speaking to adults mainly) most non-essential workers) most likely got 1-2 full months of lockdown left before things begin resemble something like the 'norm' (resemble, not actually normal).

Do you mind if I run the principles of the exercise by you to be sure I've understood them? 

You systematically work through the body, skeletally, rotating the joints and loosening the limbs, waist, hands etc. All the while your eyes and closed you're tuning in, paying attention to emotions that arise and vocalising them in a sustained 'ahhhhh' and noticing where tension has crept back in.

Something like having a phone conversation in the same room maybe. It's not the same as 'letting loose' and dancing around the place, but it helps. I use to be weary I'd be overheard on the phone or playing a musical instrument etc - maybe I'm a more extreme case. Recently I've been doing virtual play readthroughs and essentially 'acting' and potentially in earshot of my parents. I've been playing guitar, practicing singing, tai chi etc. It's helped me to be more assertive as well, but not flippant or mean spirited. Don't shrink away. Take up more space."

ADHD,forwh11,t1_forgm7y,1588019719.0,"Keep fighting the good fight brother. I'm currently wading through years of journal notes searching for a sense of self and direction. Writing helps a lot.

I did come up with some insights: Looking for deeply and specifically at people I admire, and people I envy and trying to be as accurate as possible in extracting the reasons as to why - I'm hoping that eventually I can form a sense of a life/personality by knowing what exact qualities I want in my life and (again, hopefully) come up with a plan to merge/cultivate them. 

I'm right there myself with the rising anxiety or 'sense of danger' as you put it. If it's bad enough I try and let my body express it, shake, do what it needs to do. Today I balled my eyes out and threw my hands up in the sky begging purpose and direction. It felt like utter shit but I didn't die. It was also a wake up call to drop what I was doing and take this to be of upmost importance. 

I've changed my diet lately, as well as began supplementation, and (before lockdown) was the most sociable I've EVER been in my entire life. This re-sensitised me (my theory) so that I'm more awake and present with emotion, but also stirred lots of historical issues. Finally the lockdown has given me time to pause and re-evaluate, so here I am."

I suppose I was resisting reflection and the darker place I access as a result (sometimes) of throwing your hands up and saying 'I'm completely lost'. I was looking for some insight outside myself and something concrete I guess. 

I like your advice. Sounds like the basis for a good writing exercise, which I've just begun doing this afternoon. I got a very strong sense of purpose and direction in life yesterday -  a euphoria almost, and it shattered a bit today. However I think it some ways it wasn't robust enough, although aimed in the right direction. The vision just needs fleshing out.

However I wasn't ready for it in a lot of ways, and not only that, the teaching style wasn't what I needed at the time - It was strict, and in some ways reserved. I needed a lot of encouragement, more than most maybe, and a softer touch. This was a splash of cold water to the face. I found it emotionally very challenging, and I wasn't in the best place in my life either which made a very intense experience. How is this helpful? I don't know.

I've ended up at the opposite place to you, actually. I started with PC, before finding Niod. I use to use Survival 0 & sometimes 30.

It's all quite expensive though, so I'm always looking for alternative or better proven ingredients. The one thing I like about Niod is, like you say, a commitment to the latest tech.
