ive brought up going private with my mother before, and she if i remember rightly just fobbed me off and never brought it up again.

i heavily doubt ill even get listened to by most therapists and psychiatrists. a lot of my problems are down to trauma and if they cant chuck medication at it they dont tend to bother.

i had a bs assessment back last year, i refused to tell them shit because i know theyd just feed it straight back to my mother. i want her knowing about my issues on my terms, not on theirs. i hate being treated like a child and like i cant handle my own problems when ive had to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me on my own because i knew id be stuck on a waiting list for years.

mentalhealth,fflvxvd,t1_fflramz,1580044852.0,"sadly i think those are few and far between :( especially in my country (england) we get the bare minimum of all mental health services here

its like i always say, yeah the americans gotta pay a lot of money and their system is fucked, but at least they actually get healthcare in the end"
mentalhealth,fflvi2d,t1_fflo32c,1580044651.0,"first of all, thank you!! im honored to hear that. for the whole last two years ive dedicated all of my time to learning more about my alters so i can let them live decent lives, and my disorder in general. its nice to see that someone sees that work and thinks its paid off.

junos already snapped at her once, calling her an ‘ungrateful bitch’ when she was yelling at me because i couldnt cope with the topic of therapy. (a bit of a trigger for some of us) she gives me guilt all the time about it now and she makes me feel miserable for it. 

i worry about when she will snap again. she gets upset over everything. i understand anxiety and emotional problems but the other day she got upset because i said the word ‘aint’ instead of ‘arent’, and other ridiculous stuff like that. she just seems to be getting worse with this, and of course i cant tell her to grow a set of balls and shut up, because then she’ll cry at me and ill have to try and calm her down and cheer her up. 

this is the main reason why me and juno want to break up with her, because i cannot cope with the constant stress of trying to keep someone happy when the tiniest insignificant things make them upset. shes like this even when im in a bad state and have shown her i cant help because of my mental state. its getting to the point that it feels like my head will explode everytime she shows signs of being upset.

none of us get space from her, because we’re all forced to act like one person, she briefly acknowledged our did and then quickly just stopped acknowledging it. people in our life do this a lot, and we’ve recognized just how toxic it is recently. we all have different sexual preferences and romantic preferences and so we’re struggling because we dont want to cheat but some of us are just so so unhappy in a straight relationship. she doesnt seem to want to acknowledge shes dating multiple people with different needs and wants and lives.

we communicate through text mainly (long distance relationship) so this wouldnt be a problem, but she goes out of her way to express how sad shes feeling through text, eg fake stuttering, using capitals to not using capitals, short sentences. its very overwhelming when she texts you about 12 of those kind of things at once.  i dont cope with stress very well so i end up severely dissociating and not being able to speak or text or anything, its really quite scary knowing i cant do or say anything thatll help her.

she is getting help for her problems but i dont think its the right ones. i really do think she needs mood stabilizers or something like that but id be scared to tell her that. im already pretty much at my limit, i cannot emotionally cope with this stress. im a mess of dissociation and hallucinations because of it, my head never stops hurting. i always feel like im letting people down and shes always at the top of the list.

i know its probably difficult for her, but shes taken the route of refusing to acknowledge they exist.

sorry for the long response, i hope this gives a bit more insight into my situation"

i know in my future ill be a homeless worthless cunt, with no job, no money, and no life.

and i have to watch other people get everything. it makes me so mad. why do they get things and i dont? it isnt fair. i have to wait for things that everyone else doesnt. it almost makes me want to hit out and hurt them.

i dont bother doing anything in life now because i know itll end in tears on my part, i cant be hurt like that anymore, i just cant, itd kill me.
