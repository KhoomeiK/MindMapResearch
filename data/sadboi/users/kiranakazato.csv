The pressure is more like why no one understand and respect my choice. I was a people pleaser, thus make me care to much about what people say. And I have big family culture, they like to dictate what's right and wrong in my life. And the fact that the culture in my country is heavily based on religion and tradition judgment is frustrate me to the point that I can't have a ""liberal"" voice. I mean, I respect them but why can't respect my choice. It's not like I hurt anyone.

Sometimes I feel like my view is too ""western"" or ""liberal"" for them like I hate on my country. No, I hate on the close-minded society. I just want all of us to respect each other choices. Having no choice and voice is make me go nuts. And that's the reason I have depression.

The people who judge and talk down to me about ""you'll change your mind"", ""who's taking care of you when you're older, ""what kind woman are you, refusing a gift from God, what a selfish sinner"" -- is the same people who complain a lot about how hard it is to raise children on social media. Meanwhile I'm living my best life with my husband. We can travel anywhere anytime, save money for ourselves, work hard play hard, you get the idea. 

Anyway, thank you so much for listening to my rant, kind netizen 😘"

Months a go my highschool now ex-best friend gave birth to her 2nd baby. Being a friend, I congragulated her as that's something she wants in life. Then she messaged me asking how's my life going (I'm married but childfree), I'm being polite and just answer her question in non-detailed answers because my privacy matter. And then.. She invited me (in insisting manner) that I must visit her and play with her baby. I knew exactly how's our conversation going to be and it gave me anxiety. I have to lie and said that I had flu so I can't come. And then Corona happens. So yeah.. Block her and never contact her until now. 

Guilt consumed me for some times but I re-assured myself that my mental health matters more than pleasing society.
