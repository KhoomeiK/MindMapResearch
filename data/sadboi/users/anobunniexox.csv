relationship_advice,ewludqc,t1_ewlu9v2,1565536113.0,No I’m confused and also frustrated with my self because I do feel like I was genuinely in love with him and the beginning and now I feel as if it’s faded away so much and I’m angry because I like him a lot and he’s so great I want to be able to carry on but there is just no affection
Anxiety,ewlu7n1,t3_chl6gx,1565535986.0,Make an anonymous account that’s what I did yeet
relationship_advice,ewlu5kg,t1_ewltq4o,1565535941.0,This is really good advice but I’m just currently confused and will probably have to find the answer to my confusion my self or I’m going to regret what I do
relationship_advice,ewlsa2f,t1_ewls4ii,1565534546.0,Thanks for your support much appreciated I’m just so unsure on what to do then every time I think I should talk about it with him I just end up wanting to isolate my self
relationship_advice,ewls7va,t1_ewlrv9m,1565534499.0,"I don’t know what to do it’s just like you said feels like I’m forcing it to work out of the sake of us being in a relationship but pretty sure we’re both bored/aren’t to bothered about each other my issue is when I leave a relationship I stay out of them for a while I give my self time and it’s usually at least a year or two but once I get in a new one it’s the same thing, first what 3 or 5 months are great then once you get used to each other and have settled it’s just dull! There is no excitement or anything it’s just the same thing all the time"
relationship_advice,ewlryhu,t1_ewlrstw,1565534301.0,Well I am happy with our relationship but it’s just super boring and I don’t feel like I feel a lot of affection and not just me from both ways we don’t really give each other much affection and BBD is hard to live with because sometimes if I’m in a downwards spiral it’s hard to let him hug me because of how disgusting I’ll feel trapped in my body and skin and stuff it’s just annoying and makes the relationship worse
progresspics,ewlrbhb,t3_con9rw,1565533815.0,This is amazing!
rarepuppers,ewlra1e,t3_coqt0w,1565533785.0,They had us in the first half
TrollYChromosome,ewlr79t,t1_ewlatj3,1565533726.0,Welp same
relationship_advice,ewlr42q,t1_ewlqvd2,1565533660.0,"This is also an issue because I thought maybe he’s got a bit of anxiety/depression or something that makes him not want to leave the house which is perfectly understandable because I have to and it takes a lot of mental prep for me to decide to go out especially with him because he makes me feel guilty when we do so we give up and go in but no he doesn’t, he hasn’t admitted to any and (I know it shows it’s self in different ways) but from my experience with so much shite I don’t see it in him and he is rarely sad he’s just kind of lazy, I’d completely understand if he were to have something like that and would 100% support but no he doesn’t so I don’t know where to go with the leaving the house thing"
relationship_advice,euvd6dn,t3_chh11b,1564058955.0,He may think that because he was adopted your not blood so he probably thinks stealing your personal stuff is okay because your not related but even if your not related things like that aren’t normal and I agree with the other comment about families who usually blame the victim of assault usually don’t understand the emotional abuse and trauma it causes a person and won’t take it seriously or accept that they’re precious child could do something like that
relationship_advice,eu9xzf6,t1_eu9wfa6,1563594242.0,It’s kind of miserable now because I’m constantly trying to pretend I’m ok so he does get sad
relationship_advice,eu9xw2n,t1_eu9shyu,1563594159.0,He just really likes them and finds them cute and I think he is attracted to them sexually as he does have indecent pictures
relationship_advice,eu9xtyo,t1_eu9oou9,1563594105.0,Fair enough
relationship_advice,eu9oe15,t1_eu9mln8,1563586128.0,Yeahhh I mean I like anime but it does disturb me a bit because the age of the some of the anime girls he likes is around 13-16 and it’s just a bit worrying
relationship_advice,eu9occa,t1_eu9mjds,1563586091.0,Yeah exactly he’s 20 and buying figures of 13-16 year old girls I mean in Japan I understand it is legal to have fantasy’s like this for some reason (still a bit strange) but in this country it’s really not good and does make him look a bit like a pedophile
relationship_advice,eu9o7hi,t1_eu9lu9o,1563585985.0,Maybe yeah
relationship_advice,eu9o6sk,t1_eu9aa7h,1563585970.0,Thanks for your help x appreciate it
relationship_advice,eu99ojd,t1_eu99l3m,1563574980.0,Really? It did concern me a bit I mean we only met because he was held back a year and still he was about to become 18 whilst I was 16
relationship_advice,eu99frn,t1_eu98llm,1563574813.0,Thanks for your support that goes for everyone who’s commented I’ve just texted him about it saying that I believe I should attempt to sort my mental health out as I am a bit fed up of trying to look after everyone else and I might need to put my self first which I think is a big step for me as I am full of self hate and don’t really care about my self
relationship_advice,eu98w0t,t1_eu989j2,1563574433.0,"Yeah no he doesn’t work, he doesn’t go out he occasionally sees a certain friend and I’m pretty they do exactly the same thing that he does on his own which is just stay in and do nothing he isn’t good socially he does have quiet bad anxiety I usually have to go shopping for him and I think that also goes unappreciated"
relationship_advice,eu987n2,t1_eu981vr,1563573971.0,Very true but the sessions are often every 2-3 weeks so by the time a sessions comes I either can’t remember what I wanted to talk to her about or she has a new task/goal to discuss
relationship_advice,eu98567,t1_eu9803m,1563573924.0,But I do love him because when he’s not focused on anime and stuff he is a nice person
relationship_advice,eu97t6h,t1_eu97njc,1563573700.0,He is quiet selfish too I mean not only do I have BDD but I do struggle with depression and anxiety and often if I feel down but don’t have an explanation he will turn it on to him and make it about him and feel sad and then after I’ll end up being the one attempting to make him feel better or look after him or apologising for my sadness
relationship_advice,eu97chg,t1_eu96vln,1563573388.0,This is true I just think she’ll believe him making it into a bigger deal than it already is (which I think I am but because of my condition is difficult for me not too) plus the councillor I have is pretty shite
relationship_advice,eu978p0,t1_eu96x5z,1563573317.0,"I am 18 and he is nearly 20 and we’ve been together since I was 16 and he was 17 so I am certain he is into younger girls which at the time I didn’t think about it but now that I know he is into stuff like this is sort of a read flag to me as a lot of hentai and anime can be about younger (often underage) girls, and yes he knows I have body dysmorphia but I don’t think he understands what it is and how it effects me I’ve tried to explain and show him sites and videos about what it makes me feel and see but I don’t think he’s that bothered because he’s never been concerned about my triggers"
relationship_advice,eu971jt,t1_eu96vic,1563573185.0,Yeah the problem is I was in a better place when I started dating him and now I’ve deteriorated again so I’m not sure if it’s me being worried or him
relationship_advice,eu96zls,t1_eu96v79,1563573149.0,Yes I’m doing therapy thanks for concern I also believe I am making it out to be a bigger thing than it is but because of my condition it’s hard to ignore as I am constantly threatened by my own mentality
relationship_advice,eu96rw1,t1_eu96mnl,1563573007.0,No I am to scared she’ll find it a weird topic and I’m not sure she knows what anime is as she is like 60+ so I’ve come to reddit to see if anyone can relate or advise
relationship_advice,eu96k91,t1_eu96gub,1563572865.0,Yes I receive counselling and therapy and take an anti depressants to help me understand that what I see in the mirror is a dysmorphia but with things like this triggering me it’s so difficult not to judge my self
