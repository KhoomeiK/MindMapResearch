flexibility,fdqmmji,t3_emo0nn,1578670263.0,Are you legs in one straight line while in pancake? Maybe try that as a goal
flexibility,fdqlnx1,t3_emi0e6,1578669637.0,Once it goes past 180 degrees it's an oversplit. But be careful attempting because it's easy to put to much stress on your hip flexors!
flexibility,fcvq887,t3_eiz9s5,1578007640.0,Try wrapping a theraband around your toes and slowly pointing and flexing or lay a wash cloth on the ground and try scrunching with your foot but keep your heel in one place. After these exercises gently stretch your feet with your hands or ask a friend. Just going through a tendu routine very slowly for a couple of minutes will help improve point as well as articulation in the feet.

flexibility,fcrw6h9,t1_fcrumgb,1577907453.0,"It's totally fine if your front leg isn't horizontal in the pigeon pose! My front leg does the same. That pose is more focused on your psoas anyways so as long as you are upright (not leaning to one side or the other) you're fine. I have bad knees so with that pose I bed my front leg so that my foot is closer to my pelvis. It's not incorrect if you modify it for your anatomy just another right way to do it. üòä Also if you can't go all the way down in pigeon, putting your yoga block underneath your front hamstring or buttocks will help you balance and deepen the stretch without the struggle of trying to stay aligned."
flexibility,fcrm6f3,t1_fcrl2ri,1577903629.0,"Another example is for ""head to knee"" you don't have to get your head to your knee right away. If all you can do is bend one knee and extend the other and reach your hands to the tips of your toes then that's fine. Continue that stretch and you'll get further and further everyday. Keep your head upright and your back straight and you are getting the same benefits from that specific stretch."
flexibility,fcrl8oc,t1_fcr5eif,1577903271.0,I have tight hips and I can do splits. It doesn't necessarily mean inflexible. But I have a lot of hip pain and these stretches help with that. My hips open up more after doing these stretches.
flexibility,fcrl2ri,t1_fcrjshh,1577903211.0,You just have to make sure all your bony landmarks are aligned. For example your hips should both be facing forward. Or you could take a picture and post that reddit for help. I would be happy to!
flexibility,fcr7gxm,t1_fcr2j8m,1577897884.0,I think what they were trying to say is that you are supposed to be attempting these poses until you can do them as pictured. That's why these are basic poses. As long as you're attempting it and are in the correct anatomical position you're stretching your hip. These are as basic as they get. But I understand that it would be helpful to share w the beginning stages versus the ending.
flexibility,fcr6rzw,t3_eih17o,1577897603.0,"Tight hips doesn't necessarily mean inflexible. I'm a dancer with psoas tendonitis so even though I can get into a full split, it is hard to do so without pain. These stretches help my hip release before going into a split so that it's pain free.
