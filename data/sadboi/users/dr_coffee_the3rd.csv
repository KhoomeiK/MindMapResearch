Luckily it changed when I was around 20 and now years later, I sort of isolate myself, I don't feel lonely, it's just that my thoughts changed, experiences and such are very good for you.

I already know what it's like to be in a relationship, I've already been with other people romantically and it isn't a big deal.

 Unless you actually find someone with whom you feel a true connection.
 I haven't felt a connection with anyone yet, I hope it happens some day.

It doesn't make much sense to me being in a relationship with someone who doesn't have a connection with me. Although it's hard to find."
