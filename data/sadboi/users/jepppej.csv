PedoGate,fpqi0nz,t3_geww6j,1588823258.0,"RBG actually didn’t call for the legalization of rape of 12 year olds. She was quoting a proposed senate amendment. She simply recalled the text of the bill and it was taken out of context and twisted.

However, you’re probably right- Bill Clinton probably thought that she was advocating for lowering the age of consent like most people did. That could have influenced his decision to appoint her to the Supreme Court."

SuicideWatch,fn8g6tu,t1_fn8c9lr,1586740919.0,"It's especially hard to deal with these feelings right now because everyone is going crazy with quarantining and losing their jobs. Right now I would suggest for you to talk to friends about how you're feeling as much as you can and distract yourself with movies, video games, cooking, whatever you like to do. Then when this whole virus situation is over, talk to your parents about therapy or an outpatient program. Don't worry about missing schoolwork, your mental health is more important and you and your school will find a way to handle the situation. In the mean time if you need someone to talk to I'm here"
SuicideWatch,fn8fpne,t3_g07tx7,1586740610.0,"Please don't OD. My mom took two bottles of pills a couple weeks ago and was in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator for a week. Trust me, after dealing with that, it is NOT something you want to go through or put your family through. A lot of overdoses aren't successful and end up with you stuck on a ventilator or with brain damage. Maybe try talking to your mom about outpatient psych treatment options. Day programs can be really helpful and teach you a lot of ways to cope. Or you could talk about inpatient treatment if you feel that you need it. There is help available, don't give up!"
SuicideWatch,fn8bh9d,t3_g07zik,1586737964.0,"You're only 15, don't throw your life away already! Think about how at some point you wont be stuck in the house with your mom, but instead in your own house with your girlfriend/wife. And it's not your fault that you're feeling this way. Give it some time. Things will improve for you."
depression,fn8aw0v,t3_g07z70,1586737603.0,You need to tell your therapist. You can't control what you're attracted to but you CAN control whether or not you act on that attraction. Your therapist can help you find ways to avoid acting on your feelings.
