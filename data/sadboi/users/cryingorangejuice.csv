BPD,fp2wgm9,t1_fp2cbru,1588269034.0,"check my edits- i see that my wording was totally off and that whatever these things are, decisions, related to bpd or something totally different, are not symptoms but are just something that some but not all people with bpd deal with, that are related to totally different things a lot of the time, kind of personal to some people but not at all others and people without bpd can obviously deal with too. i honestly didnâ€™t expect this post to get many views or responses so i just posted it not really thinking through what iâ€™d said, expecting it to get lost to the void. if i post something like this in the future, iâ€™ll definitely be more careful with just little things like wording

as for the last bit i understand where youâ€™re coming from n there are a lot of people like that, i am diagnosed with bpd and just going into college now so yh i am pretty young, but i am diagnosed and in therapy so not just an angsty teen, though definitely a bit of angsty teen in me ðŸ˜‚ but i really didnâ€™t mean to misrepresent bpd i just worded my post awfully. 
and i agree i donâ€™t think bpd is an excuse or a crutch for shitty behaviour and all shitty behaviour should be recognised and worked on by the person.. i donâ€™t expect them to be excused whatsoever and iâ€™m working through them and what i can do differently currently, i just didnâ€™t include this as a point initially because it slipped my mind. 

sorry about all that"
BPD,fp1oemc,t1_fp1obyk,1588242570.0,i also suffer with bipolar so i suppose that could tie in but i thought a lot of what i listed was bpd jjst cause of some other people relating

benzodiazepines,fkahl15,t1_fk8qqrr,1584008360.0,yeah iâ€™m in the uk- they felt definitely just the same as a pharma 10 iâ€™d say but then the only benzos i ever took were xans and valium so i doubt im the most aware person on the matter

bipolar,fiwmf6t,t1_fiuvkrh,1582792271.0,"iâ€™m glad i could help :) and yeah, i could only really accept a few parts of my diagnosis after they either started to improve or something bad enough forced me to if that makes sense.. i hope seroquel works for you"
bipolar,fimxaaw,t1_fimx5sy,1582549980.0,yeah donâ€™t worry weâ€™ve discussed upping the dose (suggested by prescriber) and thatâ€™s why i am- itâ€™s just i need to go up for it to work as a proper mood stabilizer and sleeping pill but they wanted to bring my dose up slowly so i donâ€™t conk out for hours at a time within a week
bipolar,fimv152,t1_fimuhmn,1582547908.0,luckily itâ€™s just making me sleep normally as of now. before my insomnia was so bad i wouldnâ€™t sleep at all every other night and would average 3 hours when i didnâ€™t. total disaster. now iâ€™m sleeping 7-8 and not feeling groggy in the days or anything but i know iâ€™m gonna have to up my dose soon for it to completely work with bipolar- so i can only hope upping it by 50 doesnâ€™t totally zombify me and knock me out for 18 hours a day i guess ðŸ˜‚
insomnia,fglnoph,t3_ez8kwr,1580905622.0,"iâ€™ve had the same problem especially with taking benzos or sleep aids, i fall asleep fine and then wake up two hours later and by the time i feel like i could sleep again i have to get up, itâ€™s truly maddening, arguably as someone else who deals with it more maddening than just not being able to fall asleep cause at least they can sleep a good 10 hours when they do fall asleep yet weâ€™re out here napping two hours at 5pm and thatâ€™s it for two days ðŸ˜‚ have the same thing and itâ€™s maddening, i havenâ€™t found anything that helps yet since most sleep aids are just designed for falling asleep, but iâ€™d recommend talking to a doctor about it and seeing if there is anything that can help as iâ€™m sure there is.. good luck"

insomnia,ffw8x58,t3_evdwrb,1580290092.0,"iâ€™ve had hypnic jerks before and they are madenning, i think one of the things that actually helps with insomnia is just letting your mind do itâ€™s thing though, letting myself refuse to think or forcing myself to count sheep or forcing myself to follow a breathing exercise and over panicking about â€˜i need to be asleep in the next hourâ€™ made everything worse for me, the best thing you can do is the same with hypnic jerks, just try again when you get one, ignore it sort of.. i know this wonâ€™t work for everyone but if youâ€™re someone who gets too stressed/excited about actually falling asleep then actually just falling into your thoughts and giving in to bloody jerks and stuff can make it better"

insomnia,feg5kre,t3_eok3dn,1579077968.0,"i understand this tooo much.. iâ€™ve finally been sleeping recently because of valium which iâ€™m not even prescribed but thatâ€™s almost worse cahse i know iâ€™m just gonna rebound insomnia when i eventually stop it, and even tho iâ€™ve been sleeping 7-8 hours still feel tired allll the time ðŸ˜‚ for real tho, i used to get really angry at the world in general when iâ€™d been up for two nights and everyone around me was asleep for 11 hours at a time and i had no one to talk to. like why can you do this simple human task that i canâ€™t so well? iâ€™m lonellyyyyy. what actually helped me before benzos was watching shit on netflix tbh. if youâ€™re really not gonna sleep it at least gives you a few hours to get engrossed in something and keep ur mind busy, hopefully less focused on the fact itâ€™s 4am and you have no one to talk to. thereâ€™s actually a lot of shit to watch on netflix so if you do find yourself in the position of having no one to talk to, give it a shot"
benzodiazepines,fdgug8k,t1_fdgu8lm,1578408608.0,"been on melatonin since august and itâ€™s never done anything. had good sleep hygeine pretty much always, i go hours without even looking at screens when iâ€™m trying to sleep. neither have worked at all and i canâ€™t function with no sleep, i just start seeing shit and becoming on edge and passing out. maybe pills are only helpful short term but i canâ€™t seem to find a better long term solution, unfortunately good sleep hygeine and melatonin generally donâ€™t cure people with chronic insomnia tho they help some people"
