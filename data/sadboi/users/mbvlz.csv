depression,fm0noxx,t3_fhu4s5,1585662385.0,"Oh I completely feel you there. Seeing what you could’ve been is definitely so disheartening and I’m so sorry you feel like that. And you’re right, you can’t change your past... but you can consciously make an effort to change your perspective on life, if you really want to. Thats the beauty of the future - you’re able to mold it and yourself in some degree. Of course there’ll be hurdles but if you follow through, you could find something wonderful. 
I sincerely hope you’re doing well, since times are especially difficult right now. But we’re here for you."
depressed,fkz30mp,t3_fl7ddv,1584661656.0,"I do this, and its for the exact same reason as you. I think I do it to feel some control over my life. I know its a form of self harm, but I do it anyways. I hope we both can overcome this!"
lonely,fkmhg5u,t3_fj4klt,1584329132.0,Being an option feels terrible. I’m with you. Please take care of yourself!

UnsentLetters,fkmgsdf,t3_fj1wxm,1584328663.0,"You should definitely tell them. A lot of people wish to hear these words, so I really encourage you to share them. 
At the very least, you may feel a sense of relief after reaching out."
UnsentLetters,fklu34l,t3_fj2e9g,1584314616.0,Many people have already said this but.... you wrote that so beautifully. I love it so much.
UnsentLetters,fkh290a,t3_fi33tu,1584185697.0,I feel this a lot

lonely,fkh1qff,t3_fidxfh,1584185056.0,"I really enjoy playing Sims also! Stardew Valley is one of my favourite games to play. Other than that, I’ve been revisiting old series and video games that I loved before and basking in the nostalgia lol

Cooking is another hobby I have. Making meals I specifically crave is fulfilling, and experimenting with ingredients can be fun too!"
UnsentLetters,fkgzyoo,t3_fibvxf,1584182695.0,This captures my feelings completely
Anxiety,fkgx1h6,t3_fi6351,1584178535.0,This was beautifully written. Encourage her to keep it up!
niceguys,fkgwpm0,t3_fiaryr,1584178066.0,Wow this is infuriating. What an entitled asshole.
depression,fkdn1jb,t1_fkdmnih,1584085596.0,"Jealousy is understandable. “How can it be so easy for them” type of thing. I think it may also be a familiarity aspect - the more you spend time around these types of social people, the more you could emulate them. But then, do it in strides as to not push yourself too far too quickly. Wanting to be or do better just proves you’re a good person, and your feelings are valid."
relationship_advice,fkdmocs,t1_fkddl1m,1584085118.0,"I really love this, thank you for sharing! I’m going to make a better effort to implement these things in my relationship too."
depression,fkdm4gs,t3_fhu4s5,1584084411.0,You’re definitely not alone in this. I also feel like this quite often. Spending time with some more outgoing / expressive friends is always a nice refresher and reminds me that there is a little spark left in me. Its just hard to accept the fact that you can be a blank slate some days and then completely change your tune around certain people.
depression,fk6g91m,t3_fgnp3a,1583901311.0,"Yes I feel this too. Most of my social interactions are at work also but its hard to relate to anyone. All my old friends are in a different city and busy with their lives, its hard to meet up without myself or the other party rescheduling (constantly). My boyfriend is also an introvert (also struggling with depression) and cherishes his personal time, so I try not to bother him. 
I usually find myself going into autopilot after sleepless nights stressing over the next day. I want to be useful to my team at work and the people I care about but most times I struggle to find the good in it all."
depression_help,fifinzx,t3_f7sa4f,1582390125.0,"At the very least, I do think writing it all out can help alleviate some of the strain you feel. I can also relate to how you feel so I understand that expressing your feelings, especially negative ones to friends or family can be very tricky but asking for helping hand or an ear to listen for a bit shouldn’t be a deal breaker for anyone who cares for you. Sometimes taking a risk and reaching out could yield to surprising and favourable results!

There are some things you can’t do alone, and venting is normal. You shouldn’t have to bottle anything up."
depression_help,fgney80,t3_ezg0g2,1580943426.0,I hope we can all help you feel better! What are some things you like to do in your free time?
relationship_advice,fgkieu0,t3_eyzh3e,1580866282.0,"I think it’ll be healthier for you to leave him. I know the lease may be a problem, but your happiness is more important in the long run. From what you’ve told us... he doesn’t seem to care about you. He doesn’t even acknowledge himself as a problem. I’m sorry you had to go through all of that and I hope you can see that your deserve better than this."
UnsentLetters,fcphwm1,t3_ei64a4,1577864773.0,"This was so uplifting, thank you so much."
depression,f39y12y,t3_dg3097,1570757871.0,Have a Happy Birthday! I’m wishing you well :)
