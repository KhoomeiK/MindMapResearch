It‚Äôs like an electric shock so I can only really compare it to maybe like a very severe and repeated static electricity sensation that you may have experienced after walking on a carpet and then touching a metal doorknob.  This can, and has, happened to other people and most pamphlets/websites simply tell you to communicate this immediately to the technician so they can reposition the coil slightly to make you more comfortable.  My doctor was of the position however, that this is the area we‚Äôre targeting so we either do that or nothing at all.  Which sounds harsh, but honestly that‚Äôs a high integrity move.  In other words, he was saying I can move the coil and make you more comfortable, but in my experience it would then be ineffective and I‚Äôd be charging you for nothing.  So I continued with the coil in place.  The pain definitely became more tolerable by the sixth or seventh treatment, but it remained painful for the entire 30 treatment duration in my case.  I also do get headaches afterwards, but they are not severe.  I seem to be in the extreme minority in terms of having such a painful experience, so please recognize that.  I just felt obligated to speak out because this ‚Äòpainless treatment‚Äô marketing is completely inappropriate and I have no idea how they get away with it.  But regardless, the physical pain still pales in comparison to the emotional pain of debilitating depression.

It‚Äôs just a simple way to show people like you what this bartender would earn if people acted like this woman.

But to shame this woman for an absolutely reasonable tip is ridiculous.  And to again use the stats from before, your $5 tip for 40 seconds of work lends itself to a tip rate of what $450 an hour?

It‚Äôs a 20 second job if ur extraordinarily slow or wanna throw a slice of lime in it.  So she essentially tipped $2 for 40seconds of work.  That‚Äôs what, a tip rate of $180/hr.  Respectfully, feel like ur on the wrong team amigo.  Would be VERY curious to know exactly what would have been ‚Äòdoing right‚Äô by this dickhead bartender in real money.

Tried basically every SNRI in the book.  Tried atypical antipsychotics.  Tried off-label prescriptions.  Currently trying an MAOI patch.  Tried the exercise regimens, supplements, nature exposure, dietary changes, meditation/mindfulness, yoga, medical marijuana, bootstrap method, counseling, blah blah blah.

Glad other people have found relief and hope more than anything that u can as well.  

Obviously, there isn‚Äôt a human being on the planet who can assure you that 100% of depression/anxiety cases are manageable - let alone curable.  It‚Äôs simply unknowable.  If there were unmanageable cases they would by definition commit suicide - at which point they would be categorized as subjects who died before some inevitably successful treatment could be implemented.  

Unfortunately, you and I aren‚Äôt off the hook as we also cannot prove that we are beyond saving.  But I do totally understand where ur coming from.  There‚Äôs nothing worse than people who ignorantly assume that their experience with mental illness is the same as yours and since they‚Äôre better you definitely will be too - you just have to do [treatment X, Y, and Z that worked for them].  Most of them mean well, they just fail to recognize the massive variance in the sub-type and severity of conditions like depression.  And they also don‚Äôt understand that while they may have gone through something tremendously difficult for days, weeks, or months - and I truly do not mean to trivialize their suffering here - it‚Äôs simply a different animal when this suffering extends over years.  That type of pain and erosion of spirit is simply indescribable. 

Anyway, I apologize for the lengthy response.  It‚Äôs just exceedingly rare that I see posts like this that I can actually relate to (especially the chronic nature of the issues).  I wish you the absolute best and I thank u for writing.  And please remember, it may look really bad for us, but we don‚Äôt know for sure that things won‚Äôt turn around.

I hope things r different for u and u can find someone who can help.  My advice in that area is to find someone that 1. You trust and 2. Relates or, at the very least, understands ur issue(s).  They‚Äôre getting paid whether they meet these two criteria or not so evaluate them for these criteria urself.  If they don‚Äôt meet them, drop them and move on to the next, don‚Äôt wait for them to admit they‚Äôre not in the best position to help u - bc that time may never come.  Like I said, they get paid either way.  

But, with all do respect to counselors, psychologists, nutritionists, yogis, etc. sometimes people r really in desperate need of significant change that simply cannot be achieved without correcting some physiologic imbalance.  If u haven‚Äôt seen a psychiatrist and tried medication u absolutely need to.  People here are, for the most part, we‚Äôll-intentioned.  But their advice on practicing meditation and mindfulness in a yoga class while drinking a√ßa√≠ berry shakes and talking it out with someone are sometimes very frustrating to me.
