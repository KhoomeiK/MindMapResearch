Additionally, I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 1, which puts me at very high risk for substance abuse. All that said, tomorrow, I will have been sober for 2 months. The only drugs I use are those prescribed to me, which you should look into. I take an antipsychotic that gives me a lot of the medicinal effects that weed did. It boosts my appetite so I don't let my depression starve myself. It knocks me out at night so I don't let my anxiety keep me awake and have me go crazy from lack of sleep. and just a cup of coffee in the morning to help me out of bed. The fact that weed makes you forget is a *problem.* Forgetting does nothing about your problems. Saying ""fuck it"" and smoking instead of working on responsibilities does not void the responsibilities. They will still exist tomorrow or the negative backlash will still hit. Learn to enjoy the processes that involve pain, for it makes the pleasures much more enjoyable. How could one appreciate the warm without cold?

Essentially, I slowly realized that everything/nothing, hot/cold, life/death,beginning/end, voluntary/involuntary, known/unknown, happy/sad were all a polarity of each other. It was incredibly scary to me because the implication here is that there is nothing to gain that isn't already possessed. That all happiness must first stem from sadness. That it is essentially impossible to play a game that has no losers. That there cannot be a heaven or hell. Just like light cannot exist without dark. It was just very daunting to my indoctrinated Christain innocent mind. With much thought after-the-fact, this knowledge is incredibly useful in my dily life.
