NYYankees,ffys00c,t3_evtq17,1580353697.0,"Love the help I’m getting here! Thank you all so much! I’m from LA so I’m used to the fast paced lifestyle, but since I’ve been in the Midwest, it’s quite slower here. Glad to hear that you guys are proving me wrong about what I’ve heard about NYers being mean to tourists! And I definitely won’t stop in the middle of anywhere for a selfie lmao"
NYYankees,ffy3flv,t3_evtq17,1580337811.0,So helpful! Thank you. I’m watching YouTube videos as well to figure out the airport and subways as well. I’ve heard things that New Yorkers hate us tourists or first timers there so I’m gonna do my best not to look like one if that’s possible! Thank you everyone!
NYYankees,ffxyevc,t3_evtq17,1580334871.0,I’m so glad I asked this. I live in the Midwest so I’m completely unaware. Thank you guys so much!
NYYankees,ffxxlk2,t1_ffxwzch,1580334407.0,Do you know where I can purchase them? I’m on the NYY website and it doesn’t give me the option to purchase.
Anxiety,fdppobh,t3_emmi8w,1578635831.0,"Everyone is different. Your environment probably being the biggest thing. It’s understandable. I’m currently taking Citalopram and Doxepin to help me fall asleep at night because I literally get so anxious I can’t sleep without a pill or something to calm me the hell down. I hope you find something that works for you and I probably don’t need to tell you this, but go see a doctor. I got lucky and mine helped me a lot. I was doing therapy for a bit, but due to financial reasons, I had to stop. I do a lot of yoga and gym time to help me with my anxiety. You will find what works and helps you. I hope you get the answers you need. Feel free to reach out. Best of luck to you. 😊"
Invisalign,f9m7fm7,t3_e5uriy,1575444717.0,"Yes. I had mine shaved. It felt so freaking weird. Not sure what instrument my dentist used, but it felt like those jackhammer (unsure what they’re really called) things that you see people digging into concrete with. I noticed the small gap from where mine were shaved, but it closed right away due to my teeth moving. It hurts and it will continue to hurt for a bit, but it shouldn’t last too long. I think my pain lasted 2 days max. Any other concerns obviously ask your dentist. Hope this helps someway."
Louisvuitton,f31q8uv,t1_f31q4br,1570581914.0,Noted. Sorry this isn’t my area of expertise. I definitely won’t be buying this then. Thank you. 😀
Louisvuitton,f31p8on,t1_f31p5rr,1570581182.0,How does it look fake? I’m not asking that in a mean condescending way I’m just curious as I’m not good with this stuff! Thank you.
Louisvuitton,f31nlm7,t3_df8xko,1570579993.0,Help* lol sorry typo
Anxiety,ez1pyrk,t3_czqtqt,1567649703.0,ALL THE TIME. I used to get really nervous whenever I knew I would have to see my in laws (I’m fine around them now) but just thinking about them being around and asking questions and wondering if I’m good enough for their son gave me the worst gastro and stomach problems. It took so long to get over that thanks to therapy and Citalopram. And also forcing myself to be present whenever they were around.
Marvel,ex9q5dn,t1_ex9q1ec,1566092723.0,Husbands been dying to have one and could never find where to get one! Thank you!
Marvel,ex9opqe,t3_crm1px,1566092103.0,Can I ask where you got the mask in the background?
MultipleSclerosis,ew650u5,t3_cmykv2,1565154246.0,"I don’t have MS but have been kinda of “lurking” on this for some answers. I also went through the whole panic attack situation and had an incredible amount of tightness and feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I then ended up losing some mobility in my hands as I kept dropping EVERYTHING. it was bad. My doctor still thinks it’s anxiety but he asked me if I had an central nervous systems diseases that run in my family (he was probably referring to MS) and I told him no. He prescribed me anxiety meds and sleeping pills for insomnia. I will say those “panic attacks” have went away but late July I started getting that chest tightness and difficulty breathing again. I then noticed my swallowing was kinda off too. I’m okay now but every now and then I’ll notice my hand mobility sucks and I’ll get weird pins and needles feelings all through my body. My doctor said if these symptoms persist, to go back in so we can do an MRI. Hoping it doesn’t come back but it’s in the back of my mind now."
Invisalign,esjo9f0,t1_esjk956,1562037688.0,Yes a little bit! I keep forgetting to ask my ortho why. Any tips to help with that?
Invisalign,esis3bb,t1_esiqigq,1562019170.0,"Thank you! And I have actually noticed small changes I’m just a very impatient person and want it to be done ASAP (like everyone else) I used to bite the insides of my cheek while eating pre Invisalign, now i no longer do that. So that’s something."
Invisalign,esiocqv,t3_c80jgz,1562017241.0,"Top pics are tray 1, started back in February 2019.
Bottom pics are tray 11, just got them put in and IPR along with severe mouth pain today on my birthday of all days. Thanks in advance! :)"
