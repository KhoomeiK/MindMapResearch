Now that you say it and think about it, that things (the shake) happens all the time.

Weird."

mentalillness,feg40a2,t3_eoyyna,1579075908.0,"It is very fucked up as how much its scares me to go to the psychiatrist or taking pills, because I feel that everything I am has been built through every depressive episode, every thought that has come out of them or the hypomania. 

I feel that I am not Bipolarity, I am not just manic depressive disorder, I am an ordinary person, with his feelings and history but, sometimes I am simply afraid of not being who I used to be, because, I don't know who else it could be, even if I have to stay that way, it's the only way I know for myself to be.

Besides, everything I have done in preparation to move out from my parent's house, study what wanted to I study and others, I did it thinking about the things that I can overcome and keep working even though episodes of any kind.

btw, the song: ‘Art School Wannabe’ by Sorority Noise its describes perfectly that kind of feeling."

SonyXperia,fb3ouj5,t3_eba3ji,1576481522.0,"First of all...
 It is and incredible macro!

The colors can be seen very vibrant (the natural colors are said to be better but the 'slight' saturation is always good for me), though the images with a high artificial contrast tend to give more detail, often dirty the background, or the image itself.

I would recommend that the more aesthetic (and clean, regardless of marked or strong 'tones or details'). Test if you like how it looks if you decrease the contrast."

They didn't do anything, just one day the algorithm decided to make that playlist and put it on their profile.
