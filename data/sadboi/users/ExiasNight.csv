depression,fkfpnpg,t3_fhtx84,1584139742.0,"I’m ugly myself (Male) and my thought process has changed over the years. 

When I was in my early 20’s I was naive and though as such: 

I may be ugly, but I have a great personality and that’s more important than looks. 
Women who don’t want to date me because of my looks are shallow anyways. 
It may take me longer to find someone, but when I do it will be a lifetime relationship. 
If only women would give me a chance, they would love me. 
Looks don’t influence success. 

Now I’m in my early 30’s, no partner, no children, and no friends. My thought process is now more realistic, being as such: 

Personality does not get the girl, looks do. Personality is what helps to keep the girl, but is irrelevant if she doesn’t want to date you in the first place, or even be around you. 
Women are not shallow for turning me down; look at nature; the best male display attracts the female. Unfortunately for myself, my display is lacking. 
Being considered unattractive equates to significantly less dates, which translates to less chances of finding a lasting relationship (I have had two girlfriends, both of which used me and discarded me). 
I realize that looks do matter in terms of women giving me a chance. From personal experience, and research, if a woman is not physically attracted to me, the probability of her cheating and/or leaving me is high (this is the majority of both men and women, and does not include everyone). 
Looks do influence success to a degree. You are afforded more opportunities in life if you are attractive, but with hard work you can still be financially stable. 

TL;DR: OP is right in regards to the vast majority of people."

amiugly,fhc7rzg,t3_f213yd,1581457915.0,"That is an accurate assessment. Most people are hesitant on this thread to actually say someone is ugly. 
I received some helpful criticism, but in regards to, let’s call them, positive responses, most were along the lines of: you’re not ugly, you’re average, I have friends who think you’re cute, etc. There’s also the common response of I’ve seen ugly guys with hot girls. Granted, I did receive several DMs about how ugly I looked, that I look gay, or various other insults, so there are also very negative responses; however, in my case the majority were along the lines of you’re not ugly with no criticism. I think a good amount of people aren’t honest because they don’t want to look mean, but they don’t experience what each of us do, as they aren’t us. In my instance, people may say I’m not ugly, but when I ask women out, I am immediately told no, sometimes in a mocking way, sometimes laughed at, or simply ignored (this pertains to online dating). In regards to upvotes, most of us are simply ignored, a common response we no doubtlessly see in other aspects of our lives. People are very superficial, and ugly people are more often than not simply viewed as not holding worth to associate with by the majority of society.

As for looks being the only thing that matters socially, that’s partly true. Personality matters, but in most cases, especially in regards to dating, personality does not come into play unless you are aesthetic in regards to physical appearance."

depression,fdm17hg,t3_elqwy9,1578537377.0,"Because no one wants me. Don’t misunderstand, I have a handful of family who do, but I live a life of loneliness. I’ve been told my entire life I’m ugly. I don’t have any friends in real life, nor do I have a lover. I’ve been in two serious relationships with women whom I loved, both ended with them cheating on me with multiple guys far superior in looks than I. I’m 31 with no children, no wife, no family of my own. I’ve considered adopting but, not to sound cruel, I want children of my own. 

It honestly feels as though life has rejected me. In retrospect, I’ve never known real love. The only girl who did say yes to me asking her out ended up using me for thousands of dollars before I had the courage to end the relationship. Pathetic, isn’t it, that I’d let a person who I knew was unfaithful and using me to stay in my life, just to avoid being alone again. 

The second showed interest in me, wanted to hold me, and the way she looked into my eyes felt incredibly real. Even the sex felt so much deeper than anything I’d  experienced. She had three kids that really looked up to me, and it felt so much like I had a family. Then out of nowhere I was ghosted, and found out she had told her friends she never thought of me as even a boyfriend, and was sleeping with other guys. 

I guess my depression stems from not being good enough for anyone."
