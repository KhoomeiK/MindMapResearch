Don't know if I'm doing something wrong on my profile or I'm just too ugly.
Turned 18 a week ago and made an account a couple days ago. I'm also not sure whether to do my profile in Dutch or English, I have a weird mix now but mainly English. 
Do other people who have their phone language in Dutch see the questions in English or Dutch?

I got 1 match but it disappeared. Do I have to confirm it or something? because I saw it and then it was gone a minute later.

Any critique is welcome, even if it's just confirming that I shouldn't try to find someone based just on looks. (I'm not pretty enough for online dating)

I might try tinder but I don't really like the image people have about it

It's just kind of a problem that it's mostly looks based and you can't really give a good representation of your personality. I'd say that I'm good at having  (real life) conversations with girls I like but I'm just too insecure with taking it further than a causal conversation. And I'm terrible at texting."
