mentalillness,fnreoq4,t3_g3ae1w,1587186715.0,Well school is technically something forced on you and you have the right as a human not to go if you don’t want to. None of the ‘greatest’ people of this world have learned to do their greatness at school. Maybe you’re subconsciously onto that

DecidingToBeBetter,fnr1tzi,t1_fnp7si5,1587177271.0,"The world leaders would order the presidents to say what they say, to some degree, and would put talking heads at the heads of companies after they have taken over them, it’s obvious it’s all the same guys, because all companies are the same, all the cars are the same, all the govs are the same etc, and they tax you 30-50% +15% on sales tax , make you use gas which isn’t scarce and pay a high price for electricity which could be free, and more taxes so that you stay poor and technically working for them until they can’t even ‘profit’ from your work, in my opinion.

It’s not about charisma to pull this off at all, more like trickery, deception. It does sound unlikely only cause it’s not believed by anyone, but i dont think it’s that complicated to pull off, actually it would just be the natural occurrence of things."

DecidingToBeBetter,fnopr2i,t1_fnooayv,1587131092.0,"Well the economy has a whole, it’s pretty much controlled by the same group, as the whole world went into quarantine simultaneously, when there was only a few ‘cases’ and it was on all the medias (all medias controlled by the world leader group) immediately.

 World leaders want control and power, not money, in fact money has been a means for them to control us since the creation of the fed in the 1910s, now it’s getting to the end game as they can generate trillions electronically with a push of a button, this is gonna get interesting, they just have to trick the masses into thinking it’s for their good, and in return get us used to being controlled. Now all the small companies are going bankrupt, only the big corporations (world leader group) are going to be left, USA and other countries are moving to be 100% communist, with the whole population going jobless and depending on their 1200$ checks. It was already 30% communist, as they took 30% of our salaries to ‘manage’ it, but people actually were slowly manipulated into believing giving up 30% is for the greater good, now they are slowly manipulated into believing all this is for their good, when it’s actually not what they think at all."

(All of society’s food is dehydrating) they rather ‘eat their emotions’ (eat so they don’t have to deal with their emotions!)
