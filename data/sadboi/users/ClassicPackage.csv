fantasyfootball,famscsr,t1_fai7ol1,1576211538.0,I can see that. I don’t think I can take the stress again! Not a fan of shit talking or gambling. Has definitely made this season interesting.

I was asked to join to have a 12th person.  Probably wasn’t thought out well to ask the office Actuary.  It’s been fun though! Congratulations on second most points!"
fantasyfootball,fadagoy,t1_fad8trn,1575961735.0,"I also snagged Lamar Jackson late in the draft. Not really, grabbed free agents when I had key players on BYE. I’ve always been last in the waiver order. I only had one trade offer for M.Thomas for K. Cole. I said no. I offered my Benched J.Allen for a decent second RB. That was declined."
fantasyfootball,fad87wn,t3_e8lri0,1575959076.0,"So I guess I’m going to the playoffs 13-1 first time playing fantasy in my office league. I got dang lucky logging into the draft late not knowing what I was doing but picking M.Thomas, Aaron Jones and Kittle at random. The other play off spots came down to the wire tonight. Work should be interesting tomorrow..."

depression,f8d6ze1,t3_e00pxq,1574480163.0,"Does your work offer FMLA? If so you can get diagnosed with reoccurring health issue that won’t count towards “calling in” or go on Short or Long Term disability (most employers only pay 60-70% off your salary) to help yourself get to feeling better. I’m sorry you’re at that place, I’ve been there more than once, where getting out of bed invokes  terror and leads to deeper depression from missing work and feeling like you’re are falling deeper down the black hole. Advocate for yourself, mental health allots the same disability benefits as anything else. You could speak with your HR rep about what your options and steps needed to take for a chronic health condition.
Best of luck to you and my heart goes out to you. I wish you the best and as cliche as it is “this too shall pass”"

TalesFromThePharmacy,f8146wz,t3_dxmd3h,1574149288.0,"I come from 3 generations of pharmacists, 1 brother and 3 cousins currently active this generation. I try to be empathetic at the pharmacy being I know they have tough tough careers. Tonight, I went to drop off my sons paper prescription an hour before close to see if I could wait, being he’s out . The pharmacist told me no way, I’ll be here all night as it is. If you fill, come back tomorrow or go to the 24 hour store. I told  her fair enough and I understand. it’s late and you have a life outside of here, I waited to the last minute and I only have my poor planning to blame. No big deal, I’ll see if the all night pharmacy has it and figure it out thanked her for her time.She took my script said she appreciated how I  held myself accountable, didn’t argue or give a sob story and could tell I was genuinely understanding and wasn’t being threatening by saying I will go somewhere else and appreciated the respect I gave her and the tech. She filled it within 15 minutes. I feel like an asshole she did that for me still, I imagine it put her further behind. Are kind, accountable and respectful people that rare in your line of work that they stand out?"
fantasyfootball,f812p2t,t3_dyfifq,1574147308.0,Tried to keep faithful to Kittle and picked up Dwelley. I was not disappointed. I’m on 11-0. This is getting nerve wracking :/

The reality is the past few seasons are for the taller girls, us short girls have had many season triumphs. Can’t win them all."

RedditForGrownups,f7aw5oq,t3_duwxtq,1573542794.0,"I’m 40, when my parents were 40 they had two teenagers and so very unhappy married but keeping together for the “family” (that mindset still existed in the 90s) my dad lived a secret life, my mom constantly down played herself.  Lots of secrets. They loved each even other if the romance died. 
I’m a single mom of a teenager, chose not to stay in toxicity with his father, yet we’re cordial co parents.  Im weird about relationships and don’t seek love, but realism. I’m happy, connect with my son, I don’t like secrets, honest where I’m at in life, I’ve exhumed the skeletons in my closet but don’t like discussing them, but know they are there. I motivate myself and forgive myself. 
I’m not too much like my parents but I do catch myself sounding like them to my son at times. My parents are/we’re good people but flawed like us all. I appreciate the sacrifice they gave so I could grow up “nuclear” family that they perceived best. That must of been so hard emotionally. Thanks mom and dad! Glad I’ve made you proud."
