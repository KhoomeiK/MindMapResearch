I think that‚Äôs our biggest problem.. LPCs as a group struggle with advocating for our profession. Hopefully this changes!"
PresidentialRaceMemes,fhelsur,t1_fhekflr,1581525083.0,"The majority of my clients find me through my psychologytoday.com profile. Some are referred by other practitioners (physicians, psychologists, psychiatrist) but in my rural-ish area, the wait-lists to see a psychiatrist can be weeks if not months, which increases the likelihood that people just go without care. 

I have had to turn people away bc I cannot bill Medicare or waive/reduce my fee dramatically in order to provide services to lower income clients. Still, many rural areas do not have enough Medicare eligible practitioners to meet their community‚Äôs needs despite LPCs being in or near those areas. 

As the law is currently written, we can be reimbursed by insurance companies but if private insurance is actually abolished and the LPC specific Medicare restrictions are not revised/lifted, LPCs will have no other option to transition to cash-pay only. This would be devastating to many of our clients/case loads."

If private insurance (currently the only way besides state provided Medicaid) is abolished without LPCs specifically included we will lose the ability to continue to see those clients and they‚Äôll have to find a new therapist. 

I appreciate your comment though. I have tried to bring this up to them in a few times and have gotten no response. It‚Äôs such a fringe issue, but an important one."

Existential_crisis,fhcf3pj,t1_fhce8j1,1581461894.0,"Fair. But we don‚Äôt have to get *hooked* into thoughts and embody them or have them take over our emotions. Mindfulness helps you become an observer of your thoughts, not change them. Not every thought it worth giving energy and we should be careful to identify with any particular thought. Non-attachment is the antidote to a true existential crisis. This can be learned through meditation."
Existential_crisis,fhcdvxa,t1_fhc7ixa,1581461293.0,"It‚Äôs difficult at first and at times I didn‚Äôt think I was making progress - but it‚Äôs possible to get through it if you‚Äôre practicing breaking that way of thinking. It helps to intentionally think *another* rather than trying to just stop thinking that way. 

Imagine who you would be if you didn‚Äôt think that way. What would you be thinking instead?

And you can strengthen your control of thoughts with meditation, which really helps."
Existential_crisis,fhblqc5,t3_f28wx9,1581444873.0,"Try not to reduce your experience like that. I did this for a long time and it wasn‚Äôt helpful. 
Found myself trapped in loops, infinitely reducing parts until all the meaning of life I once knew had been stripped away. 

Remember that thoughts aren‚Äôt facts, but if we practice them over and over again we can convince ourselves they‚Äôre true. 

Yes your foot and body are made up of atoms. But you do not have to latch on to that concept. 

I would encourage you to practice mental noting. When you find yourself thinking uncomfortable thoughts just notice them without judgement. 
Could sound like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having the thought that I am only atoms and that life is meaningless‚Äù. Don‚Äôt judge it or yourself for having it. 
Then redirect your attention to the feeling of the breath in your nose, or chest, or body. 

Check this out for more info on mental noting: https://youtu.be/TGkywgbDnx4

Also when you have these intrusive thoughts, it‚Äôs a good opportunity to lean in and explore them some. 
Compassion is something that is often helpful. Recognizing that no one chose to exist, or the parameters of their experience can be a good place to start. 
Recognize that you also did not chose to exist or chose the circumstance in which you exist - notice what comes up for you when you‚Äôre focusing on it. 
Purposely think compassionate thoughts of yourself and others having to exist. Practice it A LOT and you will eventually hit a tipping point. 

Also look into metta meditation on YouTube. 
And mindfulness. 

Good luck, friend. I hope you find some relief in your suffering."
schoolcounseling,fhbkbgr,t3_f25kg8,1581444026.0,"I worked in my grad dept as a GA and helped put on our interview days once I was accepted. This included co-facilitating our group activities and interviews. 

Above all, at least with my faculty, the number one thing they watched for was how applicants interacted with others. 
The number two thing they looked out for was self-awareness and authenticity. 

They didn‚Äôt expect applicants to know how to be a good counselor yet and were very aware that it‚Äôs a nerve racking process. 

I‚Äôm naturally very introverted, and big group of random people is something I‚Äôm not always comfortable with - so I didn‚Äôt try to go in there and be the most sociable person and still got in. But it was really apparent even then  that the faculty/grad students were assessing that. 

I still go helps as an alumni sometimes and it blows my mind some of the things people think are appropriate. 
We have had people take their phones out during ‚Äòfree talk‚Äô time - which is *really* ‚Äòlet‚Äôs watch how the applicants behave‚Äô time.

The benefit of workings face to face with someone is that much of the time we just need to allow ourselves to be vulnerable in a relationship. A therapist can help you relearn  what it means to be in a secure, nonjudgmental relationship. This, by it self, is enough for a lot of ppl to feel relief. Some might need to do more exploration than others, but the unconditional positive regard in the relationship with the therapist is the foundation of change/healing. Idk about you, but if I only talked with my SO via an app/phone the relationship would feel restricted. Nonverbals would get lost - and are often very important in relationships. Perhaps do some research in your area. See if there‚Äôs a therapist on psychologytoday.com who seems like a good fit for you. If you‚Äôre in area where it‚Äôs difficult to find services then the app route might be a good idea. Just my  2 cents"

schoolcounseling,fg7d2v1,t3_ex9chu,1580589592.0,"To work in a high school you'll need to complete a CACREP accredited grad program and whatever exams your state requirement upon graduation. In my state, I was required to take the NCC and the School Counseling Praxis - I am also pursuing a state license but it's not technically required in my state (though \*strongly\* encouraged regardless of where you live).

Unfortunately licensing in the USA is a mess. A national license doesn't exist and the requirements state by state vary wildly. Take a look at [this](https://www.counseling.org/docs/licensure/72903_excerpt_for_web.pdf) \- you'll want to be proactive if you think there's a chance you'll move later on.

In my school district, school counselors' starting pay is on the same pay scale as a teacher with a masters degree. Pay for all schools employees can vary quite a bit depending on your area, though. This is one reason going for your state license is encouraged - it gives you the flexibly to leave for a clinical job which \*can\* pay more, not to mention private practice.

Try to get your hands on a degree program or plan from the college you're looking into and research those topics a little. You'll go through techniques, theory, and other practical/internship classes but it can be helpful to be familiar with the counseling profession and how it differs from seemingly similar professions going in- would likely be helpful to have this mindset during an admission interview, too.

Not in Oregon but in my area there is a lot of burnout in schools. Admittedly, I'm working as an MHP and not a school counselor at the moment but (at least here) there is a pretty great divide between what counselors in schools roles should be and what is actually expected of you on the job. I didn't get a great administration and spend about as much energy advocating for my student and my role as I do actually meeting with kids. Cliques are common too. As an introvert I don't really tolerate that kinda stuff well but I suppose mileage can vary with that.

Hope this helps! Good luck!"
