exmormon,ffrx7b4,t1_ffrttdy,1580167922.0,"This whole thing is making me feel sick. I hate it. And if it comes down to it I‚Äôm just going to have to suck it up. I just can‚Äôt believe they put so much fuss over things like seminary... it would be so nice if we could both just put in the effort to understand each other and then our relationship wouldn‚Äôt have to be a casualty either. I don‚Äôt want that at all, the thought scares me but if they keep certain things up I‚Äôm going to push back. I‚Äôve been out all day. Went home for less than an hour and just decided I couldn‚Äôt stay with them so I‚Äôve been out working on school. Have a feeling they‚Äôre going to call me back for family home evening soon. We‚Äôll see what happens."
exmormon,ffrtf71,t1_ffrt5c4,1580165430.0,I think they already know. I‚Äôve had some late night conversations with them telling them everything wrong with the church. They just say it‚Äôs all lies and everyone goes to sleep in a bad mood. My parents just like to pretend things that make them uncomfortable don‚Äôt exist.
exmormon,ffrr9r9,t1_ffrleo6,1580164060.0,Thank you for the resources and points. Saving this for later
exmormon,ffrjgwk,t1_ffriw6d,1580159270.0,"I see, that makes a lot of sense, and I don‚Äôt think they do that either. I think most higher ups truly believe. That or they are just really good actors"
exmormon,ffrip27,t1_ffrhuyx,1580158795.0,"My parents would be frustrated with me for sure if I asked questions like that, but I‚Äôve done it before when they aren‚Äôt around. And I might be able to do something like that so that they don‚Äôt just think I‚Äôm doing this all to spite the gospel as a whole which will just keep them having a closed mind too. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt like this. I‚Äôve talked to a therapist about this before I moved but we‚Äôve only been at this new place a month and haven‚Äôt found anyone new to talk to, but I might have to talk to another adult if it persists. 

These types of situations actually cause me the most stress right now surprisingly. My life isn‚Äôt going that bad now that I‚Äôve embraced myself for who I am"
exmormon,ffrhbli,t1_ffrgk51,1580158035.0,That‚Äôs just incredibly sketchy. I don‚Äôt understand how people go along with those things. I guarantee if I told that to a tbm they would defend it. It‚Äôs almost like the can‚Äôt comprehend a reality where they could possibly be wrong.
exmormon,ffrfui7,t1_ffrfolm,1580157249.0,"We get in a fight because they get defensive and I have too much pride to back down resulting in me losing everything including the match on my college savings, my car, my precious belongings all while being forced to go to church and seminary. If that happened I would honestly just leave. No point in staying if that‚Äôs my life"
exmormon,ffrfocb,t1_ffrems9,1580157157.0,"Wait a minute? Did they say that wasn‚Äôt true? I haven‚Äôt heard that, thought they just decided to stay quiet about it like they always do"
exmormon,ffrfj8i,t1_ffp2gbq,1580157072.0,If only it was that easy with them...
exmormon,ffrfigk,t1_ffozstb,1580157059.0,I feel like that would make him get all emotional. If only they realized and then they wouldn‚Äôt be so sad by me and my sibling (exmormon) and our relationship with the church.
exmormon,ffrfe9p,t1_ffp2h3l,1580156988.0,"Thats the advice my sister gave me as well. I‚Äôm not trying to start confrontation as I‚Äôm also financially dependent and they have my college savings of several thousands dollars, my car, literally everything. If it goes really bad I could lose it all. I‚Äôm trying to go really slow for those reasons"
exmormon,ffrf9xe,t1_ffp6d65,1580156915.0,"If they something like this again, I will."
exmormon,ffrf8re,t1_ffp8i7f,1580156895.0,"Yah I know. It‚Äôs easy to see right through it. Honestly if he expects me to study daily (and confronts me about doing it) I think I‚Äôm going to say, ‚ÄúI Will study, read the Book of Mormon again etc, if you agree to study the things I believe in. It‚Äôs only fair and the best way for both of us to understand each other‚Äù. There‚Äôs a small part of me that‚Äôs hoping he asks so maybe I can open up that opportunity for conversation. But I can see it. I think they just can‚Äôt think that there isn‚Äôt a god because it causes them too much discomfort from what I‚Äôve seen in the past"

exmormon,ffrey11,t1_ffpas4n,1580156715.0,Well this would just be straight honesty. Would probably be a good way to go but I don‚Äôt know if I have to guts to be that honest with him. I think I‚Äôm going to have to take this really slow or else it‚Äôll just backfire...
exmormon,ffres6y,t1_ffpj0mq,1580156618.0,"I‚Äôm thinking about maybe making a mutual agreement. He told me to study the church, so maybe if he wants me to do that, we can study the things I want to as well. So we can both be open minded. If he can‚Äôt do that then why would he expect me to do it"
exmormon,ffreory,t1_ffppjjv,1580156562.0,"This is a great possible response if it comes up. It‚Äôs honestly perfect for what I‚Äôm feeling. Also it highlights the fact that it‚Äôs not the people I have a problem with, it‚Äôs the church itself. I think my parents think I don‚Äôt have a testimony because of things a few members have done but after research, I have no problem with the people. People are people, they make mistakes. A whole organization indoctrinating and taking truckloads of money and persecuting minorities they don‚Äôt agree with etc. etc. that‚Äôs what I have a problem with."
exmormon,ffreg2m,t1_ffp00b0,1580156416.0,"Thank you but I do agree this would be too much, and my parents are generally pretty understanding (unless it‚Äôs with religion) so I don‚Äôt think I need to be so hostile with them. If I was out of the house and they still persisted then this would good, but I do need to survive and getting kicked out won‚Äôt help"
exmormon,ffre5yg,t1_ffpl60b,1580156247.0,"They‚Äôve talked about it and yes, they believe that"
exmormon,ffr49h6,t1_ffpq8n8,1580150128.0,"They have gotten better since my sister. Apparently when she was my age, they cried because they thought she was going to hell and they were going to lose her for eternity. I think they probably still think that but at least they aren‚Äôt as bad as they were. I‚Äôm going to take it slow. Don‚Äôt want to be pushing each other away"
exmormon,ffr41gr,t1_ffpp81y,1580149990.0,"I might, someone else said that I should show them that I really had studied a lot about the church indirectly. I might try that and then progress to this"
exmormon,ffr3zxm,t1_ffpn77z,1580149963.0,It‚Äôs the worst. Wish they would‚Äôve just gotten mad at me instead. It‚Äôs easier to fight than be civilized if I‚Äôm honest. This just makes you feel bad
exmormon,ffr3x27,t1_ffpkgnv,1580149913.0,"I really am doing a lot better and I thought that might‚Äôve given them a hint that maybe the church isn‚Äôt right for me, but I guess they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm truly happy or something like that. I‚Äôll have to emphasize that more to them"
exmormon,ffr3his,t1_ffpeq72,1580149643.0,"Thank you for sharing. I know we love each other but it‚Äôs almost impossible for them to understand or accept anything I say about religion, they just say that what‚Äôs being said isn‚Äôt true and that it‚Äôs just people trying to lead me away. If I may ask, how did you end up coming around and started feeling willing to at least listen to what your kids were saying. At this moment me and my parents are not there yet and it can defiantly be frustrating for both parties I believe"
exmoteens,feync2u,t3_eqpbog,1579447917.0,"Bro I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like it but if any girl dumps you for something like this, then you didn‚Äôt need her. She‚Äôs been indoctrinated like most of the others, and she truly thinks it‚Äôs the right thing to do. I‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt really want to but she was just doing what she thought was right. 
You might not see it now, but that faith she had would‚Äôve just caused more trouble later on. Try to find someone who loves you for you when the time comes. In the mean time try to work on yourself once the initial shock and sadness is over. It‚Äôs really effective for getting over someone in my experience and and for a bonus, you come out better on the other side. Also here to talk if you need it. Goodluck man"
exmormon,fep0aw3,t1_fep058p,1579309278.0,It really sucks. I don‚Äôt want that type of relationship with my parents. Thank you. I‚Äôll for sure check them out ( :
exmormon,feozbfh,t1_feoyyc2,1579308656.0,"Thank you. That‚Äôs the goal. I don‚Äôt want to end up bad just so my parents can say it‚Äôs because I left the church. That would be crushing for me I think. My goal is to be successful, sometimes it‚Äôs just really hard when you‚Äôre working without any freedom to do what u want. I suppose I‚Äôll take what I can get though, and just try my very best. I want a good life. A happy life like I‚Äôve had this last week. I‚Äôm feeling a bit better now. I think it‚Äôs mostly just the quick shock and change of personality I had to do when they got home"
exmormon,feowmov,t1_feommir,1579306989.0,"I for sure can not be the only one. I already know one other person in a similar situation as me, it just sucks that it has to be that way. I‚Äôm 17 but only a junior in high school so I have at least another year and a half with my parents but I know I‚Äôll have a little bit more freedom when I turn 18. It just feels so unreachable sometimes, and even then I‚Äôll still be reliant on my parents for some things and that worries me. Means I‚Äôll have to continue hiding things from them even after I‚Äôm 18. I just hate that we can‚Äôt accept each other for who we are. They are the people that raised me after all. I didn‚Äôt think they would be the ones who cause me the most trouble in life. Also a therapist is in order. I have nothing against therapy, it has helped me in the past and I know it can in the future. It‚Äôs just still hard as life is much of the time. 

I plan on going to a college in state because cost but hopefully live on my own for a little bit of space. That will be happening as soon as possible. 
Also I must say thx for actually reading and responding. Sometimes having other people who understand can be really good."
exmormon,feow7jo,t1_feomlpy,1579306735.0,Thank you. I‚Äôm gonna try to do that. Messaged some of my close friends and they told me the same thing. I‚Äôll just try to prepare for it and improve myself in the meantime
exmormon,feolfnz,t1_feol2w1,1579301818.0,"If I get shit from my parents I‚Äôm gonna get punished somehow. Once I leave the house I think I‚Äôll be better off but right now it feels unbearable. Like I‚Äôm stuck, and can‚Äôt improve or start trying to be the person I really want to be. It‚Äôs so incredibly frustrating. Any religion that makes a loved one feel like that has problems, and I still can‚Äôt understand how my parents can‚Äôt see that. They care about their religion more than they care about accepting me for me"
