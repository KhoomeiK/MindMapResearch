I've been told: it's vaginal atrophy from menopause - so I was prescribed vaginal estrogen, it's from precancerous areas on my cervix - you'll be just fine after I do a hysterectomy, nope. Interstitial cystitis - some relief from meds. IBS,. But... That doctor told me I have adhesions and need surgery. Surgeon - it's a problem with a nerve in your pelvis, you need injections. After a CT scan and two ultrasounds - dermoid cyst on my ovary, need it removed. Use coconut oil in your vagina, that should help. How I was supposed to get the coconut oil inside my vagina is unknown, it does help on the outside. Before Covid19 I was supposed to have a biopsy of my vulva but that got cancelled for now. I swear if I was a man and a doctor told me I'd be just fine after he castrated me, I'd run the opposite direction. Sorry I don't have an answer for you. How many doctors have you seen? Less than 20?
