I just try not to prolongue it too far, as I’ve come to understand that 36hours is really enough for the benefits of the fast.

It will take some time..) and other eating disorders..
Diets just never worked for me. And as soon as I realized that, and looked at for example Keto (which works for me) as a lifestyle, it became so much more approachable for me :)

I hate to say it, but I NOW know its true, after so many fricking years, that it really is about perspective and persistance and you REALLY can do it, even if you NOW feel like you cant. Because that was me too, 10 years ago.
And here I am, finally (just last summer I started!) turning my life around one day at a time. And if/when I break down and binge and gain weight back because of it, I stop mocking myself and just push forward.

Lean on to that persom, cherish and love them, who ever they are and in time, yhe thoughts in your head will turn. Like mine has. 
It has taken like 10 years.. but baby steps.

Thanx for letting me hug you. I really needed that. 
Being abused mentally and sexually and also never having a non-toxic romantic relationship and just failing in the end everything that I start just puts more and more weight to try carry on living.. but I guess we’re doomed to stay alive.. because we’re too afraid of letting go, even if we want to.
So suffer with me, even if I can’t see you I’m here, like so many other people, rooting for you, as we try to root for ourselves."
