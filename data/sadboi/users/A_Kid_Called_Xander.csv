depression,fq410pj,t3_gglzew,1589072514.0,"I know this is really hard. I honestly couldn’t even imagine where I’d be if I found out my best friend had died. I’m so sorry for your loss.

I know you want to blame yourself and think of all the things you could have done, or could have done better. It’ll only make you spiral and put you in a hole that’ll only be harder to climb out of.

I bet your friend would be really sad knowing that you blame yourself. I honestly think he’d want you to be happy, and instead of dwelling on what you didn’t or couldn’t do, he would want you to remember those good times and smile.

Once again, I’m so sorry. You’ll be hurt for a long time, and that’s okay. Just try to find a good person to help you out during this difficult time.

You can pm me if you’d like to. You also don’t have to if you don’t want to.

Take care."
