ifyoulikeblank,fr6e0zu,t3_gmsuxp,1589924558.0,"For something more stylized, violent, try Utopia. There are a few shows of the same or similar name (plus an American remake in the works). I'm referring to the 2013-2014 British show (Channel 4). It's a black comedy centered around a mysterious, underground graphic novel that's somehow at the center of a Government conspiracy. The [opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01VGtX9xfh0) had me hooked. I'm not sure of all the places it is available to be streamed, but I think [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Utopia-Series-1/dp/B00FZB27IW) has it. Otherwise, I'm sure you can find it using... less conventional means.

For something more accessible but still modern day with lots of mystery and conspiracy, there's always LOST. It's got a mixed reputation in the public, but I've seen just about every major serialized TV show out there and it's still my personal favorite. It's got flaws, but it's also got some of the best characters ever in television with arcs that lead to satisfying conclusions."
JRPG,fr64av3,t3_gmuleh,1589919676.0,"It's sort of a similar question as ""Should all great movies get sequels?"" The answer isn't an automatic 'yes.' There are necessary follow-up questions. Will it contribute something compelling and interesting? Does it add and expand to create something worth its own merits? Or is it just being created for the sake of being created as a cash grab?

So, no. We don't want a situation where they are churning out remake after remake to make money. The quality will eventually suffer, and we'll get games that tarnish the reputation of a game's legacy, just like some really bad sequels can tarnish the reputation of a movie series. 

I think some remakes have been done well, like RE2, which I didn't think was possible because I loved the original and didn't think a remake would capture the experience. There was a lot of love put into it.  Remakes can be done well, but they have to be faithful labors of love.

FF7R is an interesting case. I could go on a multi-paragraph rant going into all the things I liked and didn't like. But ultimately loved the experience overall. They brought the world to an amazing level of visual quality, and while I'm hesitant to embrace the story differences, I appreciated *some* aspects of the world being fleshed out and expanded over the original. Some people think that splitting the game into 3 episodes is a cash grab, but I think it's because they have so many high budget art assets. It likely would have been a waste (not to mention a budgetary misstep in the opposite direction of a cash grab) to create all those assets for Midgar just to spend as much time there as you did in the original game. So I understand the rationale, even if playing the game a was a slightly mixed experience as far as its pacing and faithfulness to the original. 

Would I like to play other games with the same treatment? Honestly, I don't know. I think FF7 had an epicness that deserved such a remake - both in its cultural impact as a game and actual story. I couldn't see, for example, FF8 being remade in the same style. I don't know how well Chrono Trigger would stand up in this format either. Some games I think are better off remaining as they were. I think titles chosen to be remade should be carefully limited to ones that would stand up well with the current technology and popular styles of gameplay. In that sense, I would love to see more successful remakes. Just not a bunch of garbage remakes."
Gaming4Gamers,fr5megq,t3_gmmo0y,1589910959.0,"Pretty cool to have Time Crisis and the light gun. I was big into PSX and played Time Crisis in the arcade a lot, but I didn't have the light gun so I never had a chance to play it at home. Tekken and Ridge Racer are also super classic, and games that lot of PlayStation owners regardless of their genre preferences would own as a sort of a graphical showcase as well as easy-to-pick-up games that anyone would enjoy if they came over to visit. When PSX came out, its graphics were impressive. We were just coming out of the SNES and Genesis era, so to this was quite an upgrade. 3D was toyed around with during the SNES era, but his was the first time it really made it big.

Beyond that, as others have mentioned, these are some pretty random games of varying quality. Games I would hand pick as a great overall showcase of the console and among my favorite memories would include:

* Metal Gear Solid (next to FF7, one of the most definitive, cinematic games of the era that would influence so much) 

* Resident Evil 1 and 2

* Dino Crisis (unlike RE1/2, this has not been remade, so enjoying it in its old school glory is the only way to play)

* Crash Bandicoot 1 and 2

* Final Fantasy VII / VIII / IX

* Final Fantasy Tactics

* Vagrant Story

* Parasite Eve 

* Silent Hill

* Twisted Metal 1 and 2

* Gran Turismo

* Ape Escape

* Spyro the Dragon

* Syphon Filter

* Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver

* Tenchu: Stealth Assassins

* Bushido Blade (probably didn't age well but it was so different and much more slower, tactical for a fighting game at the time -- like the Dark Souls of fighting games)

* I.Q.: Intelligent Qube (really fun and frantic, different kind of puzzle game)"

patientgamers,fr10nue,t3_glvgus,1589810923.0,"I finished the game shortly after it was released - had no interest in the DLC due to feeling pretty meh after the whole experience. That's not to say there wasn't anything good about the game, but it seemed like self-sabotage. I agree that the story's concept had potential, but the execution bungled its quality. I watched Kingslaive and the Brotherhood anime prior to playing and they definitely got me pumped up to play the game, but it was weird because the continuity was hard to follow. It seemed like different teams worked on the projects, and they each put a different spin on events and characters. They were not cohesive, so that was a problem. 

The DLCs being missing in the game upon release also created some huge continuity issues. It felt like I was playing an incomplete version of the game, like a game that was Beta and almost done but not quite. I wish I waited to play it when all the DLC and Chapter 13 was finished. But I really have no motivation to go replay it all. Maybe one day a long time from now when I'm really bored. But I have too many games to play and too little free time to re-play a game I felt so-so about in the end.

The best part of the game was the journey and the main characters. I loved the interactions of the squad along the way. I loved adventuring the world, camping at the end of the night to break and bond over food. I thought the world was beautifully designed and a joy to navigate. I was genuinely emotional at the end of the game, and it was wholly because this part of the story was done so well. I teared up a bit looking at the ""photo journal"" that the game captures for you and intertwines as part of the story. It reminded me of Earthbound on SNES. It's such a good concept and more games should do it. It got me to think about the entire journey that they went through. Continuity issues aside, I got what they were going for in this simple moment, and it was beautiful. 

So despite my issues with the game, I don't regret the experience simply due to that previous paragraph. It's not a strong recommendation, but I wouldn't tell people *not* to play the game (unlike FFXIII, which I would tell people to straight up avoid). I do think FFXV had some redeemable features that make the game worth playing despite its drawbacks."

That means to me that they won't stand up for the little guy. That's the loss of respect I feel for the band. This article sums up some of my feelings, and has an interview with a Negativland member:

>The irony is that at the same time that Island was suing Negativland, U2 was taking its ""ZOO-TV"" tour around the world, illegally incorporating live satellite feeds into their video-driven stage show, a circumstance Hosler finds particularly galling.
""We were both doing the exact same thing!"" he says. ""[U2] should have turned around and gone to their label and said ""Goddammit, if you don't stop this [lawsuit] right now, there'll be hell to pay! We won't deliver you any more records, we'll break our contract, we'll cancel the tour!"" They should've gone and done something very serious. But they aren't about to do that. They claim they had no sway over Island, but of course the truth is they just weren't willing to play hardball over some little piddly record.""
>For all their ""subverting the media"" talk during the ZOO-TV tour, U2 chose not to throw their support behind Negativland. ""It's become totally mainstream to say that you're not mainstream,"" Hosler says.

What I can say is that I don't respect them as artists due to them being completely onboard with their label suing Negativland for copyright infringement in an instance where it clearly should have been fair use. The lawsuit nearly bankrupted the band. Negativland was doing things with plunderphonics, sampling, and sound collage that were not only hilarious but boundary pushing. I don't respect U2 for not respecting what Negativland was doing or even attempting to understand their art form and telling their label to lay off. Negativland were and still are a tiny, nobody sound collage artist dabbling and experimenting, barely making any money off what they were doing. U2 was OK with going after Negativland with the might of their entire big label. It's hard for me to listen to their music if I don't respect their integrity at all.

Perfect, then you want to say ""fuck off"" to the toxic aspects of masculinity. I'm being careful with my words because people get easily upset.

LetsTalkMusic,fqhnfrw,t3_giup0d,1589380563.0,"I think what you look for in music changes as you get older, and you either transition into this and bloom for the better, or it doesn't appeal to you and music becomes less important in your life. If you hold a desire to have music be important to you as you get older, you should be patient and expect a transition period as you re-discover reasons why music is great to you.

As other people have mentioned in the thread, during youth, many of us share a certain experience of rapid growth and change while trying to fit in and feel understood and desired. The challenges of this experience often find us wanting music with themes of rebellion, isolation, pain, and most importantly, *angst*, which is perhaps the word of choice for most music critics used to describe music that appeals to teens. 

As a teen, finding music like this helps you feel less alone in the world. As these feels are close to universal, there is also a lot of music out there that speaks to those themes. Music is a friend that shares in the angst that we feel. As we experience that pain, it's nice to have that friend around to feel us less alone. We understand the music, and in listening to it, it feels like the music understands us. That is very appealing. 

When you get older, though, most of us start to grow out of that angst. But those same songs -- those old friends -- don't grow with us. They stay the same. If you had friends like that in real life that didn't grow up, it'd be unfortunate, but you would eventually start to part ways. You'd look for a new friends with the right disposition for your stage of life. And those friends might not be ones that you want to remind you of pain or make you feel understood. They might be someone more uplifting, or someone to be nostalgic with, or someone to talk about more adult trials and tribulations. You might just look for friends that are fun to hang out with. Unfortunately, some people search and search, but they don't find many friends in adulthood. Maybe they didn't search hard enough, or none of the people they found appealed to them. 

This is simplifying a bit. For example, I think the one theme that is consistent from teenage years to adult years is heartbreak. Not everyone goes through a bad heartbreak in their adult years, but if you do, music is an immediate place a lot of people go to channel the pain and feel less alone. 


I'm going on 35, and I've been music obsessed for quite a while. But there was definitely a transition period for me - I'd say it was around my college years actually. I did like music in college, but it wasn't as emotional of an experience as it was in high school. All of the bands I used to listen to didn't appeal to me. I mostly listened to music as background noise, and I stopped seeking out new stuff as much. I had a few heartbreaks in college so certainly there were some albums that really clicked with me on that topic, like The Glow pt. 2 by The Microphones. But outside of that, I was in a musical rut from the ages of like 21 to 25. 

Over time though, I started to miss music. The feeling of discovering a new artist that blows my mind is so profound and enjoyable for me. It used to be somewhat easy because there was so much music history out there to discover, but at some point, it felt like I discovered it all. In my late teens I'd already listened to kraut rock and musique concrete and experimental noise and free jazz and post-punk and math rock and blues and folk and left no stone unturned. 

A as an adult, it felt like I hadn't left anything left for me to still discover. It felt like a map in a game that was 100% complete. But over time, I realized that there was an even bigger ocean of new music out there than the old - the new. It comes out as a slower drip than discovering the history of alternative music, but it consistently arrives nonetheless if you are patient for it. Like right now with hyper pop and bubblegum bass, I'm always looking forward to the next release to hear how the boundary is pushed, or is further refined and perfected as a genre and artform. And I'm sure in a few years there will be some new craze that I could never predict, and that excites me.

As for emotionally connecting to music, that is a little more challenging. My emotions and crises are a little more complex and multi-faceted than childhood, and it's sometimes hard to find music that scratches that itch well. But there are certainly artists that tackle emotional themes with more adult maturity. I think the artist that I warmed up the most to as an adult was The National. I used to not care for their music much at all, but over the last few years, I grew right into it. Music about the challenges of marriage, children, family, introspection, and growing older and feeling less understood and isolated. It came full circle, I guess, but I guess the palette is more mature. But I listen to music for a lot of reasons - to escape, to feel nostalgic, to get excited for a changing season, or just to hear a good melody to fill in the silence and entertain me. So I listen to so much different stuff, and I  make a lot of Spotify playlists to help organize those different moods and feelings. This helps me tap into and find what I want to listen to, because it's become more diverse and demanding than ever. So it's a different type of listening than when I was a youth, but none less voracious or passionate."

I heard Odyssey was more like an RPG than ever before, and as a RPG fan, that intrigued me. Been playing for a couple weeks now I can say that it's the best AC I've played. I love the combat, the skill system, how open and large the world is, and I also like the story and characters. The story is a little predictable but at the same time I'm invested in the story and want to see the conclusion of it all, which helps drive me forward. I also love hunting for new items. Going after Cultists and Mercenaries and finding unique pieces of gear with different set bonuses is great, and encourages me to try different character builds. 

Only a couple gripes. I don't have an issue with the size of the world--that's awesome--but I do have an issue with how much stuff they tried cram in it. I gave up trying to do contracts, although I pick them up and do them if they're on the way to what I'm doing. I also have trouble doing all the side quests too. There are just so many, and the quality is hit or miss on them. That being said, now that I've accepted that I don't intend to do everything in the game, it's much more freeing. It's like it's this big open world that I'm free to do what I want in, and the main quests are my primary concern. Just like real life, I don't have time to do *everything*. It makes sense - there's no reason to try to 100% every little thing in the world, at least to me. My other gripe is the level scaling - not really my thing, I kind of wish the low level stuff would stay low level and I could just one shot it all. I like that feeling of getting stronger and more powerful, and the scaling diminishes that a bit. Still, it's a minor gripe, and not one that prevents me from enjoying the game.

The ship battles are also great, building upon what the series did in Black Flag. It's awesome how big the world is yet how cohesive it all is. One of my favorite moments I've had in the game is finding a Cultist location, realizing he was on a ship at sea. I got onboard my own ship, tracked them down, and then hurt their ship enough to board them, jump on, and take him out face to face. It's impressive how well it all flows together. I've been a gamer since the NES/SNES era and it's crazy how far games have come to be able to do stuff like this so fluidly. 

After reading online, it sounds like Origins is worth checking out as well. I plan to do so - it sounds like it has a good story. I'm not sure if Origins is as strong in the RPG elements though. If it has some of that, though, I'm sure I'll love it too because the Egypt setting sounds awesome."
AmItheAsshole,fqe3k9m,t1_fqdyqs6,1589301180.0,"The main things that I think the step-daughter is doing wrong are asking the cat to change its diet and demanding the parents change their lifestyle. Those aren't her call, and she should respect those she is living with. 

Let me propose a different scenario - one that the step-daughter is still experiencing this problem, but going about it in a less asinine way. Let's say that she *wasn't* suggesting the cat should change its diet. Let's say that she wasn't demanding her parents change their lifestyle. But let's assume she is vegan, and that it has a deeply personal connection to her in her values. Let's say that the smell of meat does make her wretch, and it's something deeply wired in her that she's been unable to resolve through therapy. Let's say that, despite that, the parents didn't even try to find a way to feed this cat in a way that didn't make the girl wretch and throw up (different location and/or different time). In this instance, I would say that the parents are the assholes. 

So let's break this down:

* Feeding a cat meat - not an asshole, clearly

* Asking to feed a cat a vegan diet - asshole (plus stupid)

* Having an adverse reaction to meat - not an asshole, may not be easily within this person's means of control if it's a deeply learned behavior

* Refusing to find a way to feed cat its food without causing a roommate's adverse reaction - asshole

They literally say in the post ""We feed him in the kitchen."" Why the fuck? Cats will eat just about anywhere they feel safe, they don't need to eat in a kitchen or dining room. Why feed them in the place that your roommate prepares their own food that you know throws up at the sight of meat? Obviously the step-daughter has her own shitty reaction to this situation with her dumb list of demands, and I'm not excusing any of that. I said that some of what she's done makes her an asshole, too. But her reaction to meat on its own is not what makes her an asshole, and you don't have an empathetic molecule in your body if you don't understand that."

OP's post made it sound like this was in fact a concern.

Edit: Just saw your other question about if people stay with one company. My experience is that for large businesess like Lockheed, people often stay with that company for a long time. Lockheed will always have some new, similar work in the pipeline, and they can afford to float you here and there in-between projects. A small or midsized business, however, won't always have a new project for you to move over to, nor money to float you in-between projects. So, it really depends on the situation. Some Gov contractors work for 1 company their entire life. Some work for 10. Neither situation is better than the other inherently. The one that worked for 10 might have used each new contract to negotiate a much higher salary, whereas the person who worked for 1 only got small gradual increases every year. Conversely, the person working for 10 might have gone through a lot of shit and taken a lot of pay cuts, and had to find new work at different companies in different locations. But always know that you are in control of your fate, and you shouldn't feel like a company is holding you hostage. That is not an ideal situation, nor is it a normal situation."
GovernmentContracting,fq9wkw3,t1_fq9nw9f,1589208465.0,">But what happens at contract termination? Does my company say, ""hey you either move to contract X in Cali or we fire you""?

I've only worked for smaller fed contractors so I can only speak from that perspective. If it's a large like Lockheed or Northrop, it's possible they might do something like that, but I'm not sure because I've never worked for a large. But typically, a small (and potentially even mid-sized business) *won't even have another contract spot* for you to be readily assigned to. That's assuming the requirement itself truly ends (the Government's requirement for the work is completely going away) - then unfortunately they are out of work. You will and the contract company will typically part ways amicably once the contract ends and the work goes away completely. If you're not sure if this will be the case--if the work requirement will go away after 6 months or it will be recompeted (I'll explain recompeting later)--you should absolutely ask in your phone screen and/or job interview. This is a totally valid thing to be concerned about, and if the recruiter is experienced, these are questions they should be used to answering about. There are new people entering the field of Government contracting all the time, and these are normal questions the company should be able to give you a satisfied answer for. If you don't like the answer or it seems sketchy, then I wouldn't advise taking the position. You should feel like they are a trustworthy employer, and you should understand and be comfortable with the terms of the assignment.  

More often, if you are talking about a Government *services* contract, the requirement does not go away. The ""contract"" will end every few years, sure, but it will be recompeted every time and continue under a new contract. A services contract would be something like IT Help Desk at a Gov facility. There will always be a need for the help desk (unless they outsource or something). They might raise or lower the number of employees they need to get the job done, but it's a job they expect they'll always need to get done, so the work will continue indefinitely and continue to be recompeted under new contracts every X years (typically 3-5 years) until the facility closes or the sun goes supernova.  A contract that might not be a services contract is typically centered around a singular project with a designated endstate. Staying in the IT Realm, let's say a Government customer was interested in Cloud migration, and they wanted someone to do an analysis of the feasibility, cost, and make a recommendation on a Cloud service provider. Maybe they think it will take 6 months to perform this. Once you finish the analysis, that more than likely could be the end of the contract, and you'll part ways with both the requirement *and* the contracting company once this ends. 

It's also possible the Government will want to keep you on to actually transition their requirements to the Cloud and then maintain them, but that's not a sure thing. That's more a decision of the Government having a need for the work to continue, more so than the Contracting company. So, you have to consider whether or not the requirement is a fleeting, short term project need, or a permanent, services- oriented need. That will typically be a good indication if the work will continue to be recompeted, but obviously the best way is to simply ask the employer. They might not be 100% sure whether the work will continue, but if they aren't, they should explain the situation and where they have doubts. Then you are on the same page as them.  In most instances though, you can easily leave, especially at contract ends. If the Company says, ""hey, we want you on this contract in Alaska doing oil rig maintenance"" then you say ""No, I don't want to do that, that isn't what I signed up for, thank you,"" and you move on with your life. 

>Do you quit if there isn't an incumbent capture?


Once a contract truly ends and is not re-competed, the company won't typically ask you to stay, as more than likely they don't have a ready slot to fill. Even if they do, you aren't obligated to take that slot because it would be a different position than the one you originally signed up for. I don't think this is considered ""quitting"" a position in any case. It would be an end of contract. 

>And with working in defense contracting, do you ever feel less secure? It feels like I can lose a lot of benefits like 401k matching if I get picked up as an incumbant by another company.

As you've gathered, the incumbent (your employer) may or may not win the work. If they don't win, typically the employees have what's called ""first right of refusal"" to re-accept their position with the new company that won the work. But you are typically under no obligation to go to *either* company, however. You could say ""no thanks"" to both and be on your way. It's completely normal for you to jump over to the new contractor. Actually, being in the staffing business, we 100% expect ""our"" employees to leave to the new vendor, just as we expect to pick up the incumbent personnel if *we* win a new piece of work. It goes both ways. There are contract personnel who have been with like 3 different companies over the course of 10 years supporting more or less the exact same job requirements. It's a little strange, but they get used to it.  

This is one of the concerns of working as a Government contractor, yes. I'm on the salaried corporate side of a Government contractor in business development, so I personally don't go through this, but I have spoken to many of our employees on the topic. I'll give an example of a crappy situation. Sometimes we lose a recompete due to price. A new company comes in and undercuts us. Where do you think this new company found the money to do that? They cut salary, benefits, etc. We are a small business and don't have another slot for that employee. So the employee has two decisions: accept a position with the new contractor taking a pay and benefits cut, or not accept the new position and find work elsewhere. If people are dissatisfied, what I typically see them do is accept the position, but then go on a job hunt. Once they find a new position, they jump ship. This is the risk that the new company took on when they cut everyone's salary and benefits. When you go job hunting, you will explain the situation to a new contractor, and they will understand that having a pay reduction due to a recompete and a new company coming in caused you to want to leave. So, even though you are ""quitting,"" your reasons for doing so are completely understandable, and everyone in the Government contracting realm will understand your actions. 

>I guess I'm just wondering if others in the contracting field generally stay with one company. And what is the benefit to defense contracting aside from more pay with the clearance?

It does have pros and cons, and really depends on so many factors whether or not it will end up being good. A lot of this depends on the urgency of the work, how niche your skills are, and how much money the Government agency has to spend. If all of those are in your favor, you have a lot of bargaining power once the contract ends. You can use a contract end to negotiate a higher salary. Just because you are a Government contractor doesn't mean that you are considered dispensable on its own. Yes, the Government does have that flexibility to remove the requirement -- this is *why* they use Contracting in the first place. But I have seen many situations where the Government says: ""We love what John is doing in XYZ position. We really don't want to lose John. We will be mad if he leaves."" But if John leaves, they aren't usually mad at John. They are usually mad at the Contractor for not doing a better job at retaining John. The onus is on the Contractor to make sure John is compensated well enough for him to stay in that position. If you leave the position in a critical role, it can really make things tough for the Contract company to re-fill your position, especially when there are things like security clearances required. In that situation, it gives you a lot of power to stay in that position at a high salary. 

But let's say you aren't as important, and the agency's budget gets cut. Let's say your position could easily be re-filled with a ton of other people who don't mind working at that lower pay rate. Well, now those pros just turned into cons. At contract end, your pay might go down, and you'll have to figure out your next move. People see this as volatile. But running your own business is volatile, too. Some people take on the risk of something more volatile if it's more lucrative. And Government contracting certainly can be lucrative if you play your cards right, get into the right line of work, and make a name for yourself. Show your value to the Government as well as your company, and they will do whatever it takes to keep you onboard. They'll pay you more even if it means they have to pay everyone else less. Key positions are hugely important on a contract. But non-key positions that are easy to re-fill? That's rough. You'd be better off finding work at a more stable, salaried position if you feel this would be the case.

The last reason I will give for people who work in Government contracting is that they care about the mission. Why does someone teach K-12? It's not the pay, and it's not the hours. They want to teach. It's their passion. We have employees doing biomedical research on Ebola and other devastating diseases in the most highly secure infectious diseases research facilities in the world. It'd be hard to do the same in the commercial world. They like this work, and they put up with the occasionally shit that comes with a new contractor coming in and cutting their pay. They put up with it because they care about the mission and what they are doing. It's their dream job, even if it's not the dream contract situation."
GovernmentContracting,fq9mgtu,t1_fq9j4pr,1589202255.0,"Depending on how large the base and what kind of work is going on, there can be a lot of contract work. Obviously DC is the biggest hub, but anywhere there is one or two decent sized mil base there is typically some contract work being done that can keep you employed. San Antonio and San Diego also have a lot of work, for example. I've been working for Government contractors for 10 years in Orlando which you wouldn't normally connect with Fed contracting but there is a lot of Simulation & Training work out here, more than people realize. 

We primarily do staffing and I can say that 6 months remaining is actually not *that* short. We've tried to have people come on for less time than that. It sucks, but if there's only that much remaining on the contract and the Gov wants us to fill that position, we do our best. You could use the short term nature as leverage to get better pay, potentially, or at least try to maximize the pay that the billet will allow (they probably have a salary cap somewhere that will make it unprofitable, but your goal should be to figure out how high they will go if possible). ""Hey, because this is a short term contract, it will only be worth it for me if it pays x, because I might be out of work for a time again when the contract ends."" That is a total legit concern that any Government contractor will understand. If the contractor really wants to fill the position to maintain their relationship with the Government customer, they will take minimal profit, and perhaps even a loss (at least on your position - they might make it up elsewhere in the contract).

And it could look good on your resume. Sometimes a short term assignment looks sketchy on a resume, but in this case, you have a totally valid and verifiable reason for the work being 6 months. ""The contract was only for 6 months and then it ended,"" is what you'd say in future job interviews if they ask why you were only there 6 months. That's not the worst deal, especially if you don't end up liking the position. If you like it, you can try to find something similar in Government contracting. If you don't like it, then you have a valid reason to leave in 6 months that won't hurt your resume (like getting fired due to misconduct or something would)."

I've always been kind of so-so on this series, and reactions to Odyssey were mixed by its fanbase because it was a bit of a departure from the rest of the series. Well, apparently that departure was right for me, because they threw it much more in the direction of an open world RPG. Actually, there are parts of the UI that make it look straight up like a Witcher 3 ripoff. It also incorporates some elements from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. The combat is a mix of Assassin's Creed, TW3, and various other action RPGs. The game also keeps the nautical ship battles from previous entries in the series, which still work great. The game manages to incorporate so many ideas from different games, but puts it into one cohesive package. 

And the world is just HUGE. Some people complain about how big the game is, but  I don't see it as an issue personally. I've accepted that I'll not do every side quest, bounty, and location area objectives. I just  do whatever I *want* to do in an area, and move on when I've leveled up enough. This makes it feel more realistic to me - it's like a living, breathing world, and you can't do everything even in a lifetime, just like our own. The story's plot isn't anything too unique, but it's enough for me to stay interested. Mostly, I love the setting. The Greek world has awesome lore, and you meet different figures from its history like Socrates. The game world is also visually stunning. If you have a TV with HDR, it's crazy. The game has one of those ""get to the top of the place, obtain fast travel"" features, and I'll just sit there at the top and appreciate the view for a few minutes. I'll watch the ships down at the sea and know that I could run down to my ship, sail over to them, battle them, board them, and destroy it if I wanted to. Or I'll look off into some mountains in the distance and know if I traverse over there, there would be stuff to do. 

There are different ways to play the game, from making a character more stealth oriented, to range oriented, or straight up warrior oriented. But I'm mixing both assassin skills and warrior skills and while I'm sure it's not optimal, I'm able to play in a certain style that makes sense for how I want to play. But I've reset my skill points a few times (just costs some coin) and have messed around with different builds. There's also plenty of items to find, upgrade, enhance, etc. I can see why old school AC fans don't like this game because it's something very different. It's so many ideas from the last decade packaged into one thing, which could have been terrible and trite. But the game was so lovingly crafted, that it all fits together seamlessly."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fp5y8lv,t3_gbe3uq,1588342445.0,"1. You have to be interested in the setting. If you love the concept and style of the American Wild West, the game and its story will appeal to you. If not... well, perhaps not.

2. The game is one of the more quiet, especially in-between main story beats. I appreciate this because it's different than the norm. The game isn't afraid to lose your attention, and that's confident of the designers. But this comes at the risk of... well, losing your attention. I would get lost in working on hunting animals and trying to upgrade my camp for hours that I would forget any urgency in the main story. That could be a pro or a con for you. It's an easy game to get lost in, but getting lost isn't good for getting me to come back to the game when there are so many others out there that are more engaging. 

3. The combat itself is relatively simple. If you like a lot of depth in your combat - a lot of decision making, tactics, strategy, abilities to use, etc... the game slogs. But if you just like straight up action and simplicity with no frills, it's solid. [Here is some discussion on this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/gbdhvc/is_rdr2boring_does_it_get_any_better/).

LetsTalkMusic,fp24vlp,t3_gamx1q,1588255190.0,"I primarily use Spotify, and so I can only speak from that perspective.

1. I have thousands of artists followed that I'm interested in. This part may take some time, but start by following as many that interest you. Every time you're at an artist page that you like even so-so, give them a follow, it doesn't really hurt unless you dislike them. 

2. Every Friday, Spotify generates a ""Release Radar"" playlist. You should be able to find this in the ""Made For You"" section of Spotify's Your Library. In addition to including songs from new albums, it also typically includes new singles released by artists. I also sometimes follow my friends' Release Radar playlists so I can cast a wider net and see stuff that came up on their playlist. I follow The Needle Drop on YouTube as well, and he puts out a ""Weekly Track Roundup"" that includes mostly reviews of singles. I often find new stuff on there as well. 

3. If I like the single, I usually add it to a running playlist. You could organize these in any way that you care about, like genre. Personally I listen to a lot of stuff that blends genres and I don't care so much about that, but I do care a lot about when a song was released for its context in musical evolution. So, I organize my songs by year. I have playlists for each year going back to 2013 when I started using Spotify. All the songs I liked from each year are put into those playlists. So for this year, I have my [2020 Favorites](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5P5MO5uf3gNkCwGfXmRLEk?si=c0iOYoL0Tmy0F5SM7kxFvw) of all the songs that captured my attention. I revisit this playlist and past playlists, and they include singles. So while I'm certainly an album listener, I also like to go back and listen to this playlist to capture the vibe for the current year or past years."

But it's funny how much Odyssey feels like W3. In both games my UI is littered with ""?"" things on the map, most of which are just bandit camps or other points of interest ""for the sake of being an open world."" W3 absolutely could have benefited from streamlining and cutting down on some of the open world fat. The main quest was awesome, and the ""major"" side quests were generally great too. There was a ton of filler in-between though. The game draws me to go complete it all, and then I got overleveled and overpowered to the point where the main quest and side quests were too easy. So, scaling/difficulty issues present in W3 as well."

**Seasonal Themes**

* [Summer Mix I - Who Loves the Sun](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kywjeNdgh7Lw3w4m9Q59S?si=jDurmGVbRImqrXG58mCTZw). An upbeat, blindingly bright indie rock/pop and hip-hop playlist with surf, beach vibes. 

* [Summer Mix II - Rained the Whole Time](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6huITOSibWwIiZL3z53qwr?si=jJL66zcrRVCMHQRI5z-yWQ). A downtempo, despondent mix of chillwave, electronica, and bedroom pop for dreary rainy days.

* [Summer Mix III - Endless Summer](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4a4grj1V2A1T22AJlJSKAR?si=b_qtcecWRW66BWPvyk9P4w). A long, epic chillwave, electronica, and synth pop journey from that travels the coastlines of the world on an quest to chill the eff out. 

* [Fall Mix I - Stop to Change](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0OgVLwY2tB5bzuItaEGkkc?si=gCQiZmFtQZyFyZxWdrlNAg). Balanced highs and lows like a autumn with a theme of nostalgia, life change, and nature. Mix of southern-twanged indie rock, alternative country, indie folk, and more.

* [Fall Mix II - Dark Entries (Halloween)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4tGYgEbI8b3mVNLKMy8GYe?si=knVgcKmfSv6mxe3SL-Go8A). A ghostly journey into post-punk, goth rock, and alternative rock themed around dark thoughts, twisted monsters, and getting in the Halloween spirit. 

* [Winter Mix I - Holiday at Ultima Thule](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71yap2e8PfHoH1ya2ettas?si=3e5ud7yiT0yfu_85HCNrWw). A cheery, epic Christmas playlist that looks to touch on all the emotions that go through holiday season: from looking forward to the excitement, to nostalgia of traditional tunes, to holiday fights with romantic partners, to loving and/or hating the craziness of it all, and what makes the season magical. Primarily indie pop with small dashes of chamber pop and post-rock for a cinematic feel. 

* [Winter Mix II - Hands in the Snow](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2kVPQlpy7ZQlVDkVl4UHVm?si=sysfJK6TTfC-XatCih8rxw). An icy, reflective playlist centered around a mix of emotions that happen at the beginning of the year. Lots of songs about being cold, going through struggle, and trying to hold onto those you care about through change.

* [Spring Mix I - Spinning Away On Melancholy Hill](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2w7Sj94Rz2ucnsqpQOnswr?si=EXRF0KR4TjG8T90zK2rKiA). Not the most tightly themed playlist, although there are some songs specifically about spring. Inspired the first lines of T.S. Eliot's *The Wasteland*, spring rain tries to wash away the despondency of winter months and replace it with hopeful flowers, but for some, they aren't ready to move on, and the brightness burns. This playlist is all about the bittersweet. Songs that are happy and sad at the same time. 

* [Spring Mix II - Happy When It Rains](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7iAtolFXijGdmI5BWJDlix?si=Tx-scA8cRDe1d5rpU65hdg). Sort of the opposite of my Summer Mix II. This is a rainy day playlist, but one that is brighter and more cheerful. 

**Conceptual Themes**

* [A Love From Outer Space](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3kt6ohK3VAEHwqNIWqUdjX?si=w0L-8TSVQVuLDuJPq7Vmxw). A story about love, loss, and reunion in outer space. This is indie, alternative, ambient, synth pop, and space rock with otherworldly lyrics and textures. 

* [Spellwork and Swordplay](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/05SC2HS9caswCu9lZKxJER?si=TWrfD-8kSISf9a-Qk4Ml4w). This is a quirky, indie fantasy story of swords, magic, dragons, and heroism. While I think the theme is actually landed pretty well, it's also supposed to be a little offbeat and facetious. The fourth wall is broken in quite a lot of the songs, so it's meant to be fun. But it also has some serious moments. 

* [Dreams Don't Last For Long](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ErElxsdEHkcEgUXXyk30g?si=4vgI_SsyTbKlwxBJeW5HWA). This is a playlist about dreams, although not in a literal sense. It's a playlist about wanting to escape to other worlds and ideas, but having to ultimately be grounded in the real world. This is mainly through the lens of psychedelic pop, dream pop, art pop, electro, and avant-hop that all have a consistently strange and dreamy mood. It's a longer playlist and great to throw on in the background.

* [CityNightLights](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4SJh2SNE1WxL1jSbdUYjPU?si=yBE3L1usStObHN16zWwTog). Songs about night-time, including driving at night and going out at night. This is synth pop and electro pop's prime time. 

* [The Moon Stares Back](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6gMQXebyzDqgi1zmILjEBR?si=uPbwHzmVRzqA7tTrGuw9ww). Moon songs, particularly those that have a bit of mystical or introspective vibe. This was inspired by The Glow. pt 2 era The Microphones/Phil Elverum, so he is featured prominently as his themes serve a central motif to the playlist. Hazy indie folk, dream pop, indie pop, and more. 

* [Pu-pu Platter](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0bLXHIxVaEs6e5uuo4NpvL?si=f0S6GQ50Tfy1FqT8md1cUg). Songs about food. Self-explanatory. 

* [This Is Not A Lullaby: Songs About Sleep](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2xzWeKJ39r6U4Lj8bpYOJC?si=gFSwdM6QQrWBfucHmb2Cjw). Self-explanatory.

* [Death](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4gXVa1Ty19iZyXlIgCbd5q?si=d7hr1vO3SLi5nWpWcrX62A). Self-explanatory.

* [The Breakup Mix](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4JATYZQ6YZjtkifbk8sU2C?si=SuGQwEwSQu-Hp_hCDrxFQA). Self-explanatory.

* [Take Me Anywhere On The Road To Nowhere](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7oOeenMEJDYPMllSZnvchJ?si=YZPJSwSwR9eV13hNpRXTiw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7oOeenMEJDYPMllSZnvchJ?si=YZPJSwSwR9eV13hNpRXTiw). Songs about places, ordered geographically as a global circumnavigation. Yeah, I went a little crazy with that. 

* [Quarantined At Home](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/20ZJXt1M5dMxeFxzu2yUpI?si=HpyzvaxKTAy18OWUigx3Bw). This is obviously a more recent playlist I created. This is slowcore, bedroom pop, and indie pop centered around being stuck at home and wanting to get out. 

* [Darkness and Light](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5PMOjMLYgMhsvAQLFH2vU0?si=h-IHCM-sTNagQwj5ROmFaA). Goth, doom, neofolk, and a dash of metal on a journey into gloom and the occult. 

**Genre Specific**

* [Indie Rock History from 70s Origins to New Classics](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0W24FrDt8qP8JDqBRyXsqK?si=LkNSqW9uRn6nM3-Z7EIXDw).

* [Indie Anthems and Harmonic Voices](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14z5JNKJpZt3qv0ez0P9nc?si=kqs7vzkNSZSqvOZ9mYVruQ). Big energy indie rock. 

* [When the Sun Hits](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2uUhsOoSDMqyfCCelpE96f?si=GjvHISAmT82WL7tztJaOUg). Another space-related playlist, but this time, less theme-oriented and more centered around shoegaze, dream pop, and post-rock with spaced out vibes. 

* [TEXTURE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6SvsFH5tnI07GKf7ontIbQ?si=pebSem4ISSeeUiEviNrahQ). Less themed and more of a simple introduction to Shoegaze, Dream Pop, etc.

She's recorded under a few previous names including Eskimeaux and Ó, so you may have heard of her before.

It's a layered relationship with consumerism--she herself may feel part of the problem and feels trapped to do anything about it. That's a more emotional relationship than simply a critical satire. In a statement, she said what the video means to her. It starts off sounding like traditional satire, but toward the end get more personally complex:

>“XS” is a song that mocks capitalism in a sinking world. Given that we all know global climate change is accelerating and human extinction is a very real possibility within our lifetime it seemed hilarious to me that brands were still coming out with new makeup palettes every month and public figures were doing a gigantic house tour of their gated property in Calabasas in the same week as doing a ‘sad about Australian wild fires’ Instagram post. I mean I’m guilty of turning a blind eye too, because otherwise it makes me depressed. We’re all hypocrites because we are all capitalists, and it’s a trap that I don’t see us getting out of. I wanted to reflect the chaos of this post-truth climate change denying world in the metal guitar stabs that flare up like an underlying zit between the 2000s R&B beat that reminds you of a time when everything was alright."

It's sort of the opposite of most songs that would have a guitar solo like this. Most build up to it. They just RIP into it right from the start.

fantanoforever,fo9levn,t1_fo9fpym,1587622970.0,"It's hard to objectively rate something a 10. Almost everything has flaws. There's a certain YouTube pizza reviewer who historically refuses to give out 10s because it's setting a bar that can't ever be passed. I don't know if I agree with his logic, but I understand the hesitation.

I think a 10 is almost something that has to be personal. Albums from your childhood that made a lasting impact -- you'll always have a blind eye to their flaws. But that's what makes it a 10. It's perfect from your point of view. But that perfection might not be observed by everyone else. And that's okay. Sometimes bias is okay when it allows you to love something so completely. 

That's how I feel about Tigermilk by Belle and Sebastian. Objectively I think it's got a lot of rough edges. But none of them bother me when I listen. I can only hear the things that make it great."
popheads,fo7wk63,t1_fo7s1qf,1587585769.0,"Pitchfork's been like that for some time, at least a decade. Sometimes I'm halfway through a review and I'm like, ""what the hell am I even reading?"" I'd appreciate an offbeat writing style if it eventually came back to something more coherent, but it rarely does. 

Pitchfork is very much into the culture surrounding an album. It's like some Jungian angle of the collective unconscious or something. They think a lot about whether an album fits into the zeitgeist and where we are headed as a society -- whether something is forward-thinking in a musical sense and/or a political/social sense. I actually don't think there's anything wrong with these observations or anything wrong with caring about them - it's just something everyone needs to recognize about Pitchfork, and it does impact their scoring. That means if you compare to Fantano's score, *it's not going to be apples to apples.* They have a different barometer. That's important. 

Fantano, on the other hand, scores things more based on the music first and foremost, and its context second. He does frequently compare to other albums in an artist's discography, and sometimes he compares to other artists who've done similar things - but this is more from a musical perspective, not a cultural perspective. His reviews tend to format a lot on production, song structures, listenability, creativity, and just overall how exciting and enjoyable they are to listen through. Albums that capture his attention and excite his craving for something different *while also* being cohesive and soundly formed are things that get high scores from him. From that perspective, I think his review of FtBC is completely fair and consistent with his other reviews."

I think Sawyer's most definitive, character changing moment--the moment he absolutely dives into who he wants to be moving forward--is when he jumps out of the helicopter to jettison weight in Season 4. Jack didn't even do that. 

It's Sawyer's relationship with Hurley over the course of the show that I think shows his changes well. He goes from being a selfish jerk annoyed by everyone else on the Island to someone who is a selfless protector who deeply cares about his friends on the Island."

fantanoforever,fo6sj1d,t1_fo6lbn6,1587565892.0,"I was surprised with his Sawayama score, given how glowing his words were. I think Fantano's scoring often doesn't seem to match his words. I generally love his channel and respect his opinion but it's one of my only complaints. His recent King Krule review of Man Alive!, he seemed like he had a lot more negative things to say about that album than Sawayama, yet they both got essentially the same score. I think sometimes he scores an album based on what he feels that artist's own potential is, and how it stacks up to the rest of their discography. To continue on King Krule, I think he liked Man Alive! better than *other* King Krule projects like The Ooz, so he felt compelled to give it a higher score than that. Sawayama, on the other hand, is a debut album, and he felt that she still has more potential, so he set the bar at 8. I feel like if few years prior she had released a previous solid but flawed LP that he gave an 8 to, and then this LP came out, he would have given it a 9.

Anyway, my point is, don't compare what you think the Fiona score will be based on his Sawayama review. You'll have to look at his The Idler Wheel review to see how the new one stacks up against what he said there. Then again, that was like 8 years ago, so his tastes and ideas on his scoring may have changed since then. If he likes FtBC about as much or only slightly more, you can probably expect another 9. I'd be surprised if he gave it a 10 since he seems to reserve that for albums that do something extraordinary from every angle, including production and creativity. I'm not sure I really feel that here, even though it is a stellar album."

I do recommend taking a little bit of a break from the show before a rewatch, though. Let it all sink in, break away from a while. Think about life, the universe, and everything.

LetsTalkMusic,fnsoeae,t1_fns5v59,1587225694.0,"The original UK ""Scene That Celebrates Itself"" that got the shoegaze label included bands like Moose, Lush, Chapterhouse, and Stereolab. It also included some early britpop stuff like Blur and Thousand Yard Stare. There was a lot of variation in these bands: some louder, some dreamier, some poppier.
The shoegaze term when it was coined was meant to label *all* of these bands in this scene. Some think it was derogatory, but that's water under the bridge.

Over time, though, one band began to stand out the most with how unique they were. That was My Bloody Valentine. They brought in not only influence from their shoegazing dream pop peers but also noise rock and psychedelic rock. People naturally want to label things. I think people in the mid to late 90s, especially those without contextual knowledge of the scene these bands were born from, labeled MBV as primarily shoegaze, and came to say this was the ""definitive"" shoegaze band. 

So today, I think dream pop is associated more with lighter sounding, Cocteau Twins influenced bands (like Beach House). Shoegaze is still a subcategory of dream pop, but people associate it more with a heavier, noisier, psychedelic sound (like Ringo Deathstarr). But this is a bit in conflict with the history, and obviously people will debate these definitions to this day (as I'm sure people will with me)."

Negareddit,fnfclkw,t1_fneuslw,1586905516.0,"> I still support feminism for the most part, but I understand completely it won't benefit me.

Feminism comes in a lot of different forms and ideas, and it's evolved quite a lot over the decades. Some sects of feminism are more extreme, and aim to elevate women through the sole strategy of belittling and/or disenfranchising men. I personally don't think this represents the norm of feminism, but it's the form of feminism that most ""men's rights"" avenues will have you believe is the *only* form of feminism that exists. Yet I see them cry about it more than I actually see real life examples of it.

I think the most current and mainstream goal of feminism is one that seeks to dismantle gender roles. Historically that was mainly to benefit women , but today, we are realizing that there countless benefits to men when it comes to combating outdated gender roles. The problems men face with their suicide rate, the problems they face coming out of the military, the pressure they face when society pushes them to be sole breadwinners, etc. If you think about the psychological reasons we understand why men do things like go on shooting sprees, a lot of it comes down to issues related to gender roles. Men are less likely to seek help from friends, family, or professionals because they're told it's ""not manly."" This is absolutely a problem of gender roles, and it's one that feminism seeks to dismantle. Better understanding gender roles and reforming society to be more progressive with them is for everyone's benefit, not just women. I believe this is mainstream feminism's goal, but the ""fem"" prefix and its history makes most people believe it's primarily a women's movement."

On Metacritic, the Critic Metascore is 76, whereas the User Average is 9.3. It's not atypical for there to be division between the two on Metacritic, but when it happens, it's always interesting to me. 

My take is that fans of the Strokes seem to be in universal agreement that this is a great album--maybe not their #1, but definitely in the ranking for one of their top. Critics, on the other hand, may or may not be Strokes fans, and they're coming at this from a different angle. Perhaps they forgive less of the band's idiosyncrasies, and perhaps they're comparing more to other music today rather than the rest of their discography. I also don't think they gave it as much of a deep listen as fans did. The Pitchfork review in particular read like they barely even gave the album a shot, maybe one or two listens. The New Abnormal's singles and fast tempo songs had immediacy for me, but the rest of the album's mid tempo tracks took some warming up for me to like. If you don't take this time, I don't think you'll come out with a good impression of the album."

You might miss out on an inside joke in the future, but it's not like there are storylines to follow across episodes. It's very episodic, and that can be refreshing if you're bored of sitcoms forcing a lot of character drama. Portlandia is just weird, crazy fun.

IsItBullshit,fmbdwb6,t1_fmb87dj,1585924364.0,"This is true and a frustrating point for me as a ""flex"" sleeper that rolls around between back and side sleeping. I have slightly different pillow preferences in each one.

Back sleeping: Somewhat flat head pillow with a cervical pillow inserted into it, giving my neck additional support. There are full-size cervical pillows out there, but I find using a traditional pillow+insert gives me better flexibility for my body shape. The cervical support is extremely helpful for me as it reduces my sleep apnea. I notice I tend to get sleep paralysis without it. Pillow under my knees is nice but not necessary as I have an adjustable bed.

Side sleeping: Somewhat flat head pillow, no additional cervical support needed for my neck. However, I need a pillow in-between my legs for the best spinal alignment in this position. 

I guess the main issue is the lower body pillow. If I start sleeping and then roll onto my back, then go back to side sleeping, I usually don't get the pillow back in-between my legs. I have never really come to a solution on this, so it's a struggle."
patientgamers,fm68grw,t3_ft114k,1585788521.0,"The Borderlands series. I've tried each game in the series with an optimism that I'll get into it. I like RPGs. I like shooters. I like loot-oriented games. I appreciate quirky art styles and post-apocalyptic settings. Sounds right up my alley!  And then in each game, I get so bored. I don't know what it is, but the game feels so shallow. There's *too much* damn loot. I like loot that feels impactful and exciting, but the concept of Borderlands seems to be to just shower you with loot until you are numb to it. I don't feel like the decisions in my loadout nor my character are that interesting. All the characters seem to play more or less the same to me, their abilities not really lending themselves to a different style of play. Most of the game is pretty much still point and shoot at any level. 

Next, the world. I can't stand the story or the writing in these games. I keep thinking it will get better, but it never seems to. BL2 seemed the most fleshed out in this department, but I still struggled. I don't know why every single character seems like the same character. They all scream and shout loudly about some problem they're having, and there's no question that I'll help. There's no drama, and the comedy frequently falls short for me. Most of it seems like they're just trying to fill the air. It all comes across like some placeholder RPG template that never surprises.

The stupid thing is that I keep buying them. I own all of them. I keep thinking they're going to make some improvement. The reviews praise this game wildly, and people talk about how much they love it. I get FOMO because I really want to like the game and ""get"" it. So I buy it in hopes that, this time, something will click with me. But it hasn't. I also tried multiplayer to see if that would help me. The game was a little bit better with a friend, but I still found myself literally falling asleep after about an hour or so. And then when you play the game with random people, it's even worse. They're running in different directions or progressing the story when I'm trying to go at my own pace. Liking this game has just not been in the cards for me, despite how much I want to.

What's weird is that I like some other games in the space. I quite liked The Division, both 1 and 2. I found the pacing to be better - it has slower moments and faster moments that rise and fall better. I like the use of cover fire, and it helps it feel more tactical which is much needed in a game that seeks to compare to an RPG. It's not the most technical game ever, but it's enough to at least make it feel like my character decisions and play style matter. Destiny I like as well, although I wouldn't call it a favorite. It has an art style I really like, and while loot is plentiful, it's not extreme, and there are some sought after items that feel great to obtain. The story is a bit meh though, and over time I do get burned out at its end game. Still, I like each of those games way better than Borderlands, which I can barely tolerate."

It doesn't seem like things are going to change anytime soon. I think most now see Spotify more so as a way to get their name out there, and try to make money some other way. That's likely through touring, merchandise, licensing their songs for use in other media, etc. It's mostly their label handling this side and also taking a good chunk of that profit, so it's a lot of work to have an artist see any return on what they do.

If you wanna support an artist, buy their music on Bandcamp if they're on there, and definitely try to go see them when they tour and buy directly from their merch table.

LetsTalkMusic,flkth3t,t3_fpbuca,1585247375.0,"I think you've brought up some good points in reflecting on time period vs genre vs style. I think shoegaze is another example of something ephemeral that happened in the late 80s and early 90s, and then fizzled out. Later, new shoegaze bands emerged throughout the years, with just the last few years being a recent resurgence in the genre. There are also bands that took the genre into new directions, far beyond a simple retro fascination, and it was dubbed ""nu-gaze."" This makes it more distinct from the shoegaze of prior times. But I still think you can call it all shoegaze. It can just be confusing because in this particular case, you have to clarify whether or not you are talking about is as collection of musical ideas *or* a time period specific music scene. Shoegaze in the time period it originated was also sometimes called ""The Scene That Celebrates Itself,"" but no one really says that often. People just say the original UK shoegaze scene, and they know what you're talking about. 

My point is that sometimes a scene and genre are the same word, and this can lead to confusion. Post-punk follows a similar fate - there were original post-punk bands with stuff like Public Image Ltd and Siouxsie and the Banshees, and this was definitely a specific time period in history. But there have been bands dubbed post-punk far long after that. Preoccupations isn't that far away from Joy Division musically, though they're separated by decades time. Based on what you wrote, you would call those bands ""in the style of post-punk,"" and in some conversations that can be a helpful thing to clarify. I'm just not sure style is the right word because I think of style defined differently. I don't think of it is as doing something the same as something else; I see it as doing something differently than something else. Quite the opposite. But for the most part, I think it's fine to just call it all post-punk regardless of time period, especially if you are speaking about the structure, timbre, or production qualities that define the genre more than the time period. 

My definitions:

* Genre: A collection of consistent, shared musical ideas. Frequently you can pinpoint an genre's origin to a fixed point in time, but once it is created, it is a thing that can keep existing and have more things created within it until the end of time. It can also influence new movements, which if they are small and still retain most of its parent genre, are called sub-genres. But if they grow huge and more distant from its origin, it may become its own distinct genre. I would argue, for example, that the first-few post-rock bands could (and generally were) classified as art rock, like Talk Talk. You couldn't call it a new genre yet because the ideas hadn't established consistency or longevity across multiple artists and years. But eventually, the ideas became replicated so frequently and so widepspread that it became separate from art rock, to become post-rock. 

* Style: Unique characteristics that separate one artist from another. This is an artist's flair. It's everything outside of the base music structure. People who are only interested in the technical aspects of music often care little about style. But for people who appreciate the creative, emotional, artistic aspects of music... style is perhaps *more* important than the technical aspects of music. Like if I went to a coffee shop open mic and had to choose to listen between one of two acoustic singer songwriters: A) someone who was an extremely technically talented guitarist and vocalist, but for the most part stuck to being safe and predictable and B) someone who was less technically proficient, but had a lot of flair and personal style that made them stand out and be unpredictable... I'm going to choose B so hard. But some people would choose A, and that's their call."
