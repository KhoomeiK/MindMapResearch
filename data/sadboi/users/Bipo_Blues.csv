BipolarReddit,fqk1t6k,t3_gj0anj,1589418705.0,"I had this untested theory that, what comes along with the diagnosis is a tumultuous at least somewhat unstable life. Like nothing is for certain, if your feeling  good you know that can change at any point, its somewhat chaotic at times. So I thought, or at least I felt that my life as a bipolar person has positioned me to be able to cope well with a life altering circumstance such as this. I think in ""developed"" countries we are so used to the chaos and turmoil in other parts of the world, we sort of distance ourselves from it and kind of alienate the possibility of having to deal with tragedy such as this. So anyways, for me I kind of felt like what I deal with all the time, suddenly other people with no experience dealing with a tumultuous life really struggle, because they're used to stability, and routine and they thought that is what life is for them. But being bipolar I feel like we're trained to roll with the punches."
BipolarReddit,fq6ra72,t3_gh3rzp,1589136794.0,"Well, self care and all that is important, but its just one side of the coin. If your feeling the way you describe, I'd say whatever medication your on is not working for you. The goal isn't to just stop major episodes, its to feel alright. I've definitely felt pretty much exactly as you describe, I don't think i've been as close to my parents, but the thoughts you had, i've had before. I'ts been along time, I don't think like that anymore. I don't know exactly what changed, but (\*knocks on wood\*) I've been feeling okay for a while. Maybe meds, maybe i got better at self care, maybe its just as you get older you get better at coping with all these thoughts.   


When I'm depressed suicide always felt like the most rational thing in the world. But when I pull out of it, i just cant begin to rationalize it in the same way. It just always seemed afterwards, that I'd have done it on a whim. LIke how people who've survived, recall that half way down, they're like fuck I had a good life I shouldn't have jumped. If I can live a relatively pain free life for the next 60 years, then I'll stick around."

BipolarReddit,fkczfu6,t3_fhogid,1584064722.0,"well if binge drinking means I'm manic then lock me up! I mean if theres any concern yea I think Adderall should be the first to go.. If your not used to having a credit card while ""healthy"" id probably avoid opening one spontaneously, you know, better to wait on those decisions... like wait a month or more and if you think you've been stable then maybe make the decision. Definitely be careful with the spending, I'd say make a list of things, and sit on it for a while, and if you still really want them when some time has passed then maybe take the plunge assuming you can afford them. Wanting a credit card kind of leads me to believe you cant afford them.  


Same goes for the sex be careful, your credit you can improve over the time after manic mistakes. Your never gonna get your virginity back so again, i wouldnt act impulsively on that, while being in an elevated mood might be a great time to meet new people, its a shitty time to delve into a relationship. Focus on sleep, if you get that under control and you still feel good, maybe your just in a good mood. Stabilize the sleep. seroquel, zopicolone w.e. get 8 hours."

BipolarReddit,filv8qu,t1_filgzom,1582511161.0,"yeah, that part is kind of weird. Mood stabilizers/anti-psychotics can work well controlling mood, but anxiety might need to be treated separately.

Although I only really preemptively take one before public speaking."
BipolarReddit,fildh95,t3_f8du49,1582499117.0,"well, what ever gets you through the day as long as you arn't self sabotaging. All people, but I think especially bipolar people have dependencies to things, as long as you arn't damaging yourself, I think its okay to indulge in those.   


Orgasms induce sleep, at least in guys so it makes sense why he would use that to get to sleep. You could help him out if you don't want him watching porn, although thats probably not in the cards if you guys just argued. weed and porn seem like pretty tame coping mechanisms. If you said, his weed usage is damaging your relationship because you spend less quality time together as a result of his lack of sobriety then yeah, i think thats a problem. As long as he's making it to work, and not endangering himself then i don't think its too much of an issue, 3x a week seems pretty moderate. Even when the medication is ""working"" your still gonna have coping mechanisms of some sort."

BipolarReddit,fhw1cg9,t3_f4s9ns,1581904528.0,"I never really considered withdrawing from all courses dropping out of school unless it was like a permanent thing. But then yeah, i had to drop out too. They were supposed to be ""medical withdrawls"" but, it ended up just being a regular W on my transcript. I dont think that effected me that much though.  


The other thing, I think theres a difference between reaching a good place, and continuing to feel ""good"", its part of the illness that your probably not going to maintain feeling good forever, but you can maintain being in a good place. I mean one where your life circumstances facilitate you feeling the best you can feel at that time.  


I'm not too sure how scholarships work in this situation, would definitely be worthwhile reaching out to an academic advisor about that, and to make sure you get a medical withdrawal. I know most people dont have the luxury of unlimited time, but I would say go at your own pace if you can, don't bite off more than you can chew, don't try to take 5 courses to keep up with everyone else. Took me 8 years to get my degree."

I always think, you know its always the worst when your having this dream and it gets cut short because you have to wake up. So, might as well make the best with what you have. After all, it is a bit of a lucid dream, you can pretty much do whatever you want within certain confines.

Sometimes I think it actually helps me think through issues, like ill come to conclusions to problems I'm having in life. Or at least thinking over the issue helps me reafirm my position, and I think i become more decicive/confident."

I mean, obviously its not realistic her dad stay home with her, he shouldn't feel guilty for having to go to work. As for Anna, at the very least it seems like her meds are not working for her and she should probably see her pdoc. Lithum takes a few weeks to get to a therapeutic level, so if it was very recent she might not be there. Lots if not most people take meds in conjunction with lithium. At most, I would say she has been misdiagnosed, at that age your first diagnosis isn't necessarily the one that ""sticks"". I can't personally relate to a lot of her behaviors, except the hitting yourself part, I have done that."

BipolarReddit,fefbjsy,t3_eolj4u,1579052705.0,"shit yeah, I had thought for years that it seemed like I was low on testosterone, just like the way I interacted with people and the anxiety that i felt etc etc. So eventually told my psych, and she was like sure we will test it, came back way lower than the normal range. then tested my prolactin which was at the levels of which are found in pregnant women (I am a non pregnant male), turns out i basically should have been lactating at this point, and got asked numerous times by different doctors if i had experienced any discharge through my nipples. To which I responded fuck no, I would go straight to the doctor if any thing came out of my nips. Anyways, got an MRI turns out theres a benign tumor on my petuitary gland, a micronoma that exretes prolactin in the pituitary gland. Point being, if i didnt bring it up the issue would likely never have been noticed, and the issues would be treated by more medications, or i guess i should say it wouldnt have been noticed until the point i started extreting liquid from my nips."
BipolarReddit,fc50zsf,t3_eg825s,1577437534.0,"Ew, well, I always go with the ""honesty is the best policy"" policy, because i feel like its going to make me feel better and it might make them feel better too. This mostly occurs with burned bridges, old friends who I dont talk to things like that, everyone that has stopped talking to me at some point or another is like a constant nag. I think about these people pretty often, and want to kind of make ammeds, or get closure.

Honestly though, it never really works out as intended, often makes things messier. And i've found in the process of explaining myself, i over explain to a point where i no longer feel satisfied with my explaination. It sucks to keep things in, but i think life is less messy if you do."
BipolarReddit,f70mtup,t1_f6yjdq1,1573330196.0,"Well, I had crippling depression before I had the manic episode, which is why I went on the anti depressants. So I think all you need is one depressive episode and one manic episode, and I fit that criteria. Some times I still think maybe it was a one off event, but I dont think it was like an accident and I'm actually mentally healthy. Its more just that I've been stable since my episode with multiple minor depressive episodes, I think theres only been one time since the manic episode that I've felt suicidal and it wasnt near as bad as before I was on medication; so basically I cant relate to a lot of bipolar things. Even my memory of what being manic was like is vague. Basically, its pretty clear that im not as mentally healthy as a normal mentally healthy person, but I've been on medication and still been able to function pretty well. It just seems like a big risk to stop taking medication, and apparently the effectiveness of the same medication your taking is unknown if you stop taking it and have another episode. I made friends while I was in hospital who were also bipolar and they didn't take medication and it just seems like not a great route to go down."
