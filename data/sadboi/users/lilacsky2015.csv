Rateme,flftq2n,t3_flykla,1585117444.0,Your eyebrows and nose are perfect! And I disagree with a lot of the people on here and I actually think your body is really nice! You look like you’d be nice to cuddle :)
Rateme,flftj0r,t3_fmrvfg,1585117238.0,Your eyes are gorgeous!!

I know that anxiety is tough, but I promise you that things will get better. I believe in you and know that you can get through it! Sending love from California!"
Anxiety,fcwrmc5,t3_ej29di,1578034840.0,"This is exactly how I feel! I am still in college and only work part time, but I’m dreading the day that I have to work full time. It is really scary to me."
memes,f8at9tj,t3_dzttf6,1574410751.0,I felt this on many different levels omg
Anxiety,f81witz,t1_f816c45,1574178900.0,"Thank you so much! I do go to therapy and have an anxiety diagnosis, so I do think I could get a note from my doctor for my school so that is a great idea. What’s interesting is I do sit closer to the door too in class and just the freedom of knowing that I am closer to the exit makes me feel so much better! I do need to get to a point where I can be a little more open with my professors when I am really struggling and that is definitely something I am going to work on. Anxiety is tough but I’m not giving up because of how important my education is to me and because I want to prove to myself and others with anxiety that we can do it!! Again, thank you for your kind words and support!"
Anxiety,f81674e,t1_f813ryn,1574152110.0,"This makes me feel a lot better, thank you! I wasn’t sure if this was a common thing or not but I’m glad to know that other people go through it too. It makes a lot of sense because college is such a stressful time! There is so much about it I love but I’m finishing up my applications to transfer to a university and I think that is what is causing me to be extra stressed out about everything."
Anxiety,f812w37,t1_f812g3a,1574147563.0,"I’m sorry that you feel this way too, but it’s nice to know that I’m not alone"

dating_advice,f72ipby,t1_f72ikjn,1573364522.0,Yeah that’s what I’m sort of afraid of. I wish there was some magical way to sift through guys and find someone who was sweet lol. But if I do end up meeting with someone irl I’ll be very careful!
VintageClothing,f72hy6v,t3_du25ke,1573363723.0,That’s such a beautiful dress! The print is just so pretty!!
microblading,ew2ehus,t1_ew1djcf,1565044709.0,"They didn’t seem to ever come back, so at my touch up she gave me a powder brow instead which worked a lot better for me. The powder brow still faded a little lighter than I was hoping for but I can still see it which is definitely an improvement from the last time!"

teenagers,eufmd0n,t3_cg614k,1563780643.0,Ouchie
Anxiety,eu41haz,t3_cemmjp,1563433819.0,"I experience this each time! The couple of days before my period are anxiety filled and I just feel terrible. And then once my periods starts I usually go back to feeling fine. I hate it, but I just try to remind myself that it’s my hormones and that I’m not actually in danger or have something wrong with me."
Disneyland,eu40hga,t3_cen458,1563432538.0,I love riding rides while the fireworks are going off! I think my favorite is riding Matterhorn during the fireworks. There is something about hearing the boom of the fireworks while speeding through the dark which makes it extra fun. I’m going to have to try big thunder mountain next time.
Rateme,etkzg1e,t3_caj4wz,1562914416.0,"From an 18 year old girls perspective, I think you’re super cute!! I really don’t think there is anything you need to change or improve about yourself!"
Anxiety,et8o6t6,t1_et392l3,1562563060.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words! They truly mean a lot. We CAN get through this even though it might take a while, but it will all be worth it. I know that once I overcome this I will be stronger, which is true for you as well! I also believe that changing your thought process is very important which is something that my therapist has also talked about and we are working on together. It’s tricky to do this, but I think once I do master the art of redirecting my thoughts to a different path, I’ll be able to handle situations that tend to spike my anxiety better. Lol sometimes if I’m feeling bad I’ll look down at my stomach and tell it “not today” which sometimes helps relieve the nervousness like you were talking about because it reminds me that I’m in control and not my stomach. Again, thank you for all the advice and helping me feel a lot  less alone. It’s nice knowing that someone else out there understands and is working through it to get to a better place just like I am."
Anxiety,et2yg5z,t1_et0o23q,1562425050.0,"I’m so sorry that you are having to deal with this as well, but  it does bring me comfort knowing that I’m not alone. I try to do breathing and to change my thought process too but normally once I’m at the point where my stomach is hurting it ends up being pointless, but every once in a while if I go lay down and rest it will go away. It’s weird how sometimes it will go away on its on and others I have no choice but to have to use the restroom. 

I totally relate to the idea that being alone is easier then having to deal with the stress that going out with people causes :( I come from a family that loves Disneyland so I go often and omg even though I normally have a good time it usually causes me the worst stomach problems and I end up wishing that I was just at home alone so I didn’t have to deal with inconveniencing my family with the fact that I’m off having a panic attacks and they know it. My family has a beach trip planned in a couple weeks and I’m already feeling nervous about it, but I’m trying not to think about it. It too makes me upset about feeling like I can’t have a normal life, but when I read about others feeling the same way I do and about how they deal with it, it reminds me that this is a “normal” for some people and that there are so many different types of normal out there. It would be nice to be able to leave the house and not have to worry about it though. I’m totally going to try the peppermint oil, so thank you for the recommendation!! Also, best luck to you and your new boyfriend! I truly hope that you are able to get to the point where you can spend time with him without that fear of not feeling well. It’s interesting how even just anticipating something fun can trigger anxiety. It happens to me a lot too so I purposefully try to make sure I don’t get too excited about things because I know that my stomach misinterprets what I’m actually feeling, lol. If you ever need someone to vent or talk to I’m here as well!!"
Anxiety,esinit6,t3_c7qg28,1562016816.0,"This is very sweet, thank you!!"
lonely,es8ls5b,t3_c6cad3,1561702864.0,You don’t deserve to hear those kinds of things. I’m truly sorry that you have to go through that.
lonely,es7cgfn,t3_c633pq,1561668081.0,"In all honesty, I actually prefer guys who look more feminine. I am not really into super well built guys, and am definitely attracted to skinny guys and I know a lot of people who are too. I’m really sorry you feel that way though. I obviously do not know exactly what you are going through, but I hope you are able to realize your own self-worth soon.  I understand that it can be hard though. And don’t listen to your friends btw, they sound like jerks"
Anxiety,es7bwcy,t3_c66pkl,1561667768.0,That is so amazing! I’m so happy for you!!
microblading,es2n3gy,t3_c4hos9,1561530644.0,I got mine done on June 8th and am going through the same thing! Mine currently look like how they looked before I got them done and I’m really worried that the strokes won’t come back. I’m trying to trust the process though and be patient.
ibs,erzmjt8,t3_c4tu6b,1561441369.0,"This is the exact issue I have!! I’ve been dealing with it for 5 years now (ever since I was 13), and it makes me miserable. I’ve been going to therapy and I’m really hoping to find some sort of solution soon. I hate feeling like I can’t go out and live a normal life because I’m so afraid of my stomach flaring up. It keeps me from doing a lot of things."
Anxiety,epzzczz,t1_epyg8zs,1559675500.0,"I’m so sorry that you have to go through this as well, but I feel better knowing that I’m not alone. I’m in therapy currently trying to find a way to fix this, but I’m really not sure how I could ever break this cycle :( I wish that my brain wasn’t stuck in this loop."
Anxiety,epydjyi,t1_epwieat,1559629115.0,I experience the same thing!!! I hate it because it’s gotten to the point where a lot of my anxiety is mainly just triggered from my fear of having stomach pain/ diarrhea which keeps me from leaving the house and makes me overall super afraid a lot of the time. It is truly awful.
Anxiety,epshbrj,t1_epsazln,1559448958.0,"I will keep this in mind, thank you. I have recently started seeing a therapist who I like so far, and I am hoping that she can help me address what I’m feeling so I can get to the point where I feel better and can live my life without the constant worrying. It can be hard to talk to others sometimes because I don’t want to feel like I’m burdening them, but I know that ultimately it is helpful to reach out."
Anxiety,epsa4dc,t1_eps7t2j,1559442192.0,"That is very kind of you to say and truly means a lot, thank you. Having an unpredictable stomach is extremely difficult, and I’m sorry that you have to deal with it as well. I’m slowly trying to get to the point where I am able to accept that my stomach sometimes behaves this way, and not let it send me into full blown panic attacks."
Anxiety,eps7wih,t1_eps71ud,1559440295.0,"That’s actually really good advice, thank you! I’m going to try that."
