But you know what that‚Äôs a good point, they do try to do Black Metal inspired riffs in a lot of songs, and it makes sense to me now why I will dislike those songs.

I‚Äôm not white but I‚Äôve felt what Trump supporters feel. I‚Äôve grew up in the inner city, have witnessed Black and Hispanic violence and crime, it makes you afraid and that fear can turn into irrational hate towards anybody that resembles those people. I had a good family and me and my brothers managed to stay away from all the nasty stuff growing up. Now we are all college educated and have honest ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù careers. 

As a result I eventually understood how socioeconomics worked. I have a lot more patience and empathy and no longer irrationally hate the same people I grew up hating. 

But at the same time you can‚Äôt imagine going back to that level of poverty. When you finally get out of that hole, it‚Äôs easy to become a little selfish and all of a sudden stuff like ‚Äúthe right to life, liberty, property‚Äù has more weight. Republicans are always trying to protect those rights, and that‚Äôs not wrong or anything. But these days they are willing to marginalize, destroy, neglect, abuse, even ‚Äúkill‚Äù now (protesting quarentine) anyone that dares to infringe on that right. Trump and his ‚Äúpseudo Alpha‚Äù attitude makes republicans feel safe, he makes them feel like it‚Äôs okay to marginalize people in the name of ‚Äúlife liberty and justice‚Äù when of course to anyone else with a brain on the outside looking it, it most definitely is not ok."
