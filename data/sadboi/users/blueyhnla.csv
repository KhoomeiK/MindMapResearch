You did not use cocaine even though you could of just to try and make yourself feel better.

You are a gamer, even though you do not feel the urge to play right now it is obvious that this is something you enjoy. You were looking forward to same game releases which meant you could see a future.

You talk about friends and girls that are interested in you, even though this is not something you are interested in right now, you have people there if you want them.

You are seeing a therapist and you are on medication, you mentioned you feel tired a lot, perhaps you could speak with your therapist about looking into changing the dosage or the medication.

I'm sorry for the long reply. I hope you are still here to read it"

SuicideWatch,f0ltywc,t3_d5fq09,1568729502.0,"Please don't do this.

 I lost my father only 14 days ago and honestly it is and was the worst thing I have ever been through. He went so young and so quick but what keeps me going is knowing that I was there for him in those final moments when he needed me.

Your mum's future might look terrifying for you but if you can manage to be there for her you will see between the moments that are really bad there will be positive moments with her that you deserve to be around to share with her.

If you need someone to talk to feel free to message me"
