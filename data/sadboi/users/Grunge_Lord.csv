AskReddit,foi1odj,t3_g7clah,1587776902.0,"My mom is manipulative and a control freak. In the past she has told on me. I, being a 7 year told her about the activities we did at my cousin's house, one of which was face timing her guy friend. Being from a conservative family, it was frownd upon. She told my cousin's mom and that created problems for me. She has also insulted me in front of her side of the family which I absolutely despise, my matern grandfather is a complete asshole. One time when I was in middle school (my mom taught in the same school,)someone told her that my two of my classmates were dating, she told the teachers which earned my friends (the two who were dating) weird looks. My friends thought I snitched on them due to which they stopped talking to me. I had trouble making friends the whole time I was in middle school. Now that I m starting my a levels, she is blackmailing me emotionally and isnt letting me study the subjects of my choice. And the sad part is It took me 17 years to realise that I have a toxic family. All she cares about is her Job. When I was starting school, I would come home to my aunt(we lived in a joint family) and my mother used to be at work. I barely got to spend anytime with her. And when I asked her to leave her Job (because it was making things difficult for us, she takes out her frustration on me and shouts violently just because theres an unwashed cup in the sink). She makes me feel guilty because apparently I m the reason she has to work. I often talk to my friends about my family, if this is the way they're treated but they said no. And I see my cousin's , their parents NEVER treat them this way."
