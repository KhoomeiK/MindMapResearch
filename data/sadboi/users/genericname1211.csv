I was staying at my cousin’s house for a couple nights, because my mom was doing something (too much to explain), and we were staying up later then we should have been. My cousin and I were staring outside her window, and suddenly time started to move really fast. We saw the moon move across the sky. You know how in movies/TV shows there’s stock footage of people cars moving quickly, it was like that, yet real. My cousin and I looked at each other shocked as hell then continued to watch. The next thing we knew it was morning and we hadn’t slept. Still not sure if it was a dream, a hallucination, or something else...

Edit: I should clarify this was when I was about 7"

I wanted to be a boy myself for the longest time. I hated everything to do with what I considered too “girly”. I did grow out of it though, once I hit puberty. So how could it truly be know with such young children?

Then there are stories of children who do start to transition until late into puberty, after taking blockers and going on hormones, that end up regretting it.

selfharm,fe6h0vw,t3_enu1uu,1578890640.0,"I posted this on my alt account, but I think this is relevant.

Someone asked the same question on another site and I thought I’d share a response that was given.

“Self harm can be a addiction for some people that do it often or regularily because when someone cuts themself it releases endorphins and adrenaline into your brain. The chemicals relaeased into your brain send signals to nerves that can make you feel numbed/temperarily better. This is because your brain is trying to help you deal with the wound. As you self harm during times of distress or depression, your body links the feeling of that distress or depression to the self harm. Your body releases you will wound yourself and craves the endorphins to feel better. This dangerous because over time you become immune to the endorphins. Which means you have to cut deeper to achieve the endorphins. Eventually one day you could cut too deep. So basically it is an addiction because it gives you chemicals that your body related to self harm, causing you to self harm more to get the chemicals, which you can get immune too, and could lead to cutting too deep.”"
