I'm fortunate that the residential facility I went to also worked with subtance abuse, so I got to interact with people who had more legitimate substance issues. Really what brought me to AA was telling myself my rape was my fault because I was drinking. IOP focused more on substance than mental health, and they followed the 12 step model, but I felt like one therapist was projecting her shit onto us. While all of the other therapists talked about all kinds of things (mostly relating somewhat to addiction), this one therapist talked in detail about how and why all codependents are narcissists. Every single day she lead a group. It's hard to feel like her calling me a sociopath should hold any value, but I managed to internalize it regardless of if I am or not.

I was considering SMART Recovery before considering that I'm not actually an alcoholic, I took blame for something I didn't do. There's nothing to detox from when you have 1 drink a week. That's probably my best example of taking responsibility for something that isn't my fault, and what happened in IOP may be me projecting my issues onto someone else - or the therapist projecting them onto me. I have no idea and I may never know."

I find that when I try to divide situations into what was my doing and what wasn't, I excuse my actions or I take blame for actions other people take that are designed to elicit a certain emotional response from you.

I'll check out the article, but without even reading it...I used to ""find myself"" in a lot of drama that could have been prevented with early, calm boundary setting.

mentalhealth,fphiiiy,t3_gddy1y,1588621882.0,"I can relate and also hope you don't do it.

I attempted suicide at 15. I was an outcast at school, not even fitting in with the other outcasts. My mom was abusive and I was getting told to kill myself online (if you don't remember Formspring, there were a few suicides linked to it). Since then, I've tried to overdose, tried to jump in front of a train, and had a thought-out plan. I'm not sure how many of the ""attempts"" were impulsive actions that were dangerous or serious attempts.

I'm 25 now. Had I known that after this much time all I'd have to show for myself is more trauma, fewer supports, and a personality that therapists say are both codependent and sociopathic, while still being too poor to sustain myself and being reliant on others for housing, I would have tried harder at 15.

The little things got me this far. I busted my ankle and learned to walk again. I was only down for 8 weeks - it didn't matter. I learned that I can improve my flexibility with yoga and lower my BP by breathing, things I thought were off-limits for me. The $800/month I was making pre-COVID was from starting my own business, and it was enough to move me across the country.

Here's the problem: I see all of that stuff as small. Most people reading this will view it more positively. I see a bum who isn't thriving at the level functioning adults should be; they see a fighter who created opportunities for themselves and challenged deeply held beliefs. I get it. It doesn't matter if othere see your progress, if you don't, you won't be happier.

I was 24 when I finally got HPV, so I had a span of 6 years where I could have gotten the shot. Following my exposure, I had some bad luck and had a kidney infection and bronchitis. Needed to be on suppressed antibiotic therapy. Immune system couldn't handle the HPV, and what went from a ""come back in a year"" issue turned into surgery, a colposcopy, and a referral to an oncologist if a single wart returns since I was told my cell changes were precancerous - I had 3 strains, 2 of which can cause cancer and one of which caused warts. Time between HPV dx and the surgery was 6 months.

It also doesn't just end, and to say someone who can't move out is forced to lose privacy because you give them shelter is abusive. My dad tracked me as a teen and I accepted it because I was a minor. Then, I went away to school and he still tracked me and commented frequently on my locations. I was 5 hours away and couldn't go to the store without an explanation. At 24, I moved across the country and he was STILL tracking me, saying so long as he supported me a bit financially, he was to know where I was - mind you he's never been to this area so he doesn't know what it means to be on so and so street. He started shit with my family, saying I was homeless because he frequently saw I was at a park and I don't normally enjoy the outdoors. Air quality is better here and the park is at the library where I work. I got a new phone plan and disconnected from his. He still wanted a way to track me.

This isn't about her age; it's about control. This OP is talking about more restrictions that chances are, they won't lift on her 18th. Worst of all is that she'll just sneak now.

AskDocs,fjao7fo,t3_fcastk,1583177368.0,"NAD, just someone with a family filled with eating disorders and narrowly avoided one myself.

It's not about your start weight. It's about the way you think about food and the way in which you're losing the weight. Food is supposed to be taste good and serve a nutritional purpose - with such heavy restrictions and eating just 400 calories a day, you're not enjoying it or getting nutrients.

I went to a residential treatment center with people suffering from a variety of things, including eating disorders. Several of the women there with ED were heavy, maybe even obese. Your size has less to do with it than your habits.

My sister too developed her eating disorder while overweight. She had the same dilemma - she was still overweight, yet, was physically and mentally unwell due to her habits. Long story short, she started peeing what looked like oil and her liver failed. She survived but still struggles.
