buildapc,fdogprk,t3_embul1,1578604797.0,"**tl;dr - Yes, buy a 1440p 144hz monitor.**

A 1440p 144hz monitor is a wise investment. A good adaptive sync monitor will stay with you for one or two GPU upgrades at least so by the time you are considering a better resolution and/or higher framerate display, your GPUs will likely be able to push the framerates of the games you play then quite well.

When it comes to difference, running 100 fps on a 60 hz monitor is the same as running 60 fps on a 60 hz monitor since that is all it can show you. So running 100 fps on a 144hz monitor would be an 80% improvement in the flow of motion on your display which you will not only see but more importantly feel. There's a certain tactile element to having that very low latency between a mouse movement and a visual response that feels much better as well and thats in everything from an FPS to an RTS to just bonking cards in Hearthstone or Magic, etc... Everything feels better with a high framerate display and since they all usually have good to great color (IPS and VA panels, usually) you get great visual clarity on top.

My suggestion to you would be the LG Ultragear 27GL850. It's a g-sync compatible display, it actually has HDR and 10-bit colordepth but more importantly, it has 98% DCI-P3 and 135% sRGB colorspace which is professional-grade levels. And its got 144hz and so on."

chronotrigger,fcyvxzu,t1_fcymqsm,1578088259.0,"It's not just CT remakes. Unless you can guarantee a better outcome than the original version, a remake is completely pointless and since CT is already one of the best games ever made, what then is the purpose other than the simple gimmick of slapping some nice graphics and new mechanics on it? You're asking for so much work to be done only for such a minor difference in the end and that's assuming that it lives up to the original which it most assuredly wont.

I get that people really love stuff to the point where they for obvious reasons want to see more of it, either in terms of direct continuation or a remake that further embellishes what the original was but I really dont want to see a remake of Super Metroid or Illusion of Gaia either. Those games are also brilliant as is. It's the same as asking for a remake or sequel of The Shawshank Redemption...

I'm not averse to new ways of designing games but if were gonna design in new ways, why not new games as a whole? We don't need to dig up old titles to make something really good as is evident with new IPs like Dark Souls which you mentioned. And that franchise in turn inspired a ton of other creative minds.

I'm absolutely gonna play a CT remake if it does happen. I love the game to death. But I think it's a complete waste of time to make one when the original stands perfectly well today just as it did when I was a kid."
chronotrigger,fcyaxl8,t1_fcxrb3n,1578077385.0,"The end of CT clearly shows Crono marrying Marle, Lucca inventing the machine future and they even zip by a machine future thats almost utopian. The only loose thread in the game is Janus and Schala. If they are gonna remake it, they also have to remake the story structure complete with loose threads.

Look, remakes are essentially glorified laziness from a creative standpoint. Deliberately retreading old ground is blatant fan service and nothing else. It's only done because its a low risk way of generating revenue for a company. I don't want Chrono Trigger used as a cheap easy money card for Squarenix. FF7R is already looking like its going to incorporate a lot of the modern mechanics from the latest in the franchise and those mechanics are really... really bad. People are undoubtedly still going to buy and play it because the love of the original is incredible and the younger demographic has no frame of reference to what the old FF titles were like to play. The thing that had JRPGs in a category of their own has been eroded away over time to the point where most of them blend in with the generic action game + rpg element formula. Splash in cinematic presentation, an open world or crafting or any of the other nice sounding but mindless additions games get these days and you're starting to look at what a CT remake would become were it to be made. It won't be nearly the same just like the FF7R title wont be either. Consider voice-over acting in Chrono Trigger. That already messes up the atmosphere of it. One of the best elements of those games is reading the lines and inferring the characteristics of the individual on your own, like a book, which makes classic JRPGs so personal and the stories so intense.

The fact that both gamers and companies now seem to want remakes and sequels more than original titles is worrisome and when it comes to Chrono Trigger, that hypothetical remake has zero outcomes where it turns into a remotely good game by comparison. Part of the reason CT is good is the very style its made in, sprite graphics and snes audio, squeezing the most out of 4 MB of data, etc... If people came around 20 or 30 years after one of my albums and told me they wanted to remake them in a new way I would just tell them it wasn't gonna happen. I'm pretty sure that's what the people behind CT feel considering how hard they worked to perfect that game."
chronotrigger,fcxhwl5,t1_fcwae15,1578063345.0,"The story is fully expressed and selfcontained in that one game so a direct sequel is pointless. A spiritual sequel I could get behind since that doesn't encroach on the original but it really is meaningless to remake something thats considered perfect by critics and fans alike. If Alien wasn't a good enough example, try Gladiator. Or Forrest Gump. The idea of wanting a remake because it will be ""different but the same"" is a recipe for disappointment and it will ruin the first impression that the original has. I'd much rather just see a new IP since the game doesnt need a remake to begin with. It still plays excellently today just as it did when it was released. People still fall in love with the story and the music (even if its always gonna be Corridors of Time over all the other brilliant pieces) and that in itself is testament to the futility in trying to put a new coat of paint on it and believe it won't be a worse product.

If Squarenix ever decides to remake CT they will inevitably fuck it up and the name will be worth less in peoples minds as a result. They should build a spiritual successor if they're gonna revive those old mechanics but even then they wont have the same minds behind it so it will become a very different product shaped by the modern school of gamedesign. When it comes to the enemyplacement, using Dark Souls as an example is not viable. Dark Souls is an original title so they made that game using whatever roadmap they decided was best and designed it in any way they felt was best. A remake of CT would mean you have to have a flawless copy of the pacing of combat, the positioning of enemies, their movement ai (which includes a new third axis for flying enemies) and all of this with a turnbased system with a hint of realtime logic to it. For every single fight in the game. This is one of the reasons Chrono Trigger took so long to make. The art is great and all but not all that heavier than Final Fantasy VI or contemporaries. They had to tailor code for individual fights rather than rely on random encounter logic with premade sets of encounters (3x Enemy A in a Pincer engagement, for instance). All of this then also has to be translated so it feels just as good in a 3D engine as it does in a 2D engine. Abandoning turnbased combat for realtime would ruin the entire structure of the combosystem and render the remake crippled as a result but thats what they've gone for with the FF7 remake and its no doubt going to be a very very beautiful hamstringed experience because of that. the RE2 remake was so successful because they could abandon so much of the shitty parts of the original like the door loading mechanic required due to the PSX's limited capacity to cache data. So as I mentioned earlier, if the original game was flawed, the remake has a chance and thats why RE2 hit home. Chrono Trigger on the other hand isn't so a remake has nothing but a downhill slope to work with in terms of quality. A shiny new engine wont save it from all the compromises it will invariably have compared to the original."

chronotrigger,fcvet6e,t1_fcva3i5,1578000600.0,"If they remake the original, it will quite literally be disturbed. People will be introduced to the remake before they play the original and their perception of the game will be flawed as a result.

Concerning your notion that its rarely celebrated outside of its dedicated fans, that's probably because the game is 25 years old. Alien is a movie now celebrated mainly by its fans and fans of the genre. So is Citizen Kane. Both are phenomenal but a ton of people will probably never see them unless they start getting into older movies. Thats what happens with time. I don't want a remake of those movies just as much as I don't want a remake of Chrono Trigger. The power of a remake is in making something that could've been better as good as it deserves to be. Chrono Trigger is damn near immaculate so there is nowhere to go but down and it would require immense resources and time to perfect a modern engine that did the same thing. Every scene in CT was handmade, every enemyplacement thought out based on the AI and the abilities you had acquired up to that point. To reproduce that level of detail in a modern fully 3D engine would require a ton of time and effort and we already know at the end it would still not be what CT still is to this day which already has the outcome of the project decided before they even begin. 

I get that people love games, movies and so on to the point where they'd like to see a remake but if the original is already fantastic, just play that. The remake will inevitably be a disappointment and people who haven't played the original will get the wrong idea which just ruins the name. That's why I'm saying SE should start a new project. I don't get why fans won't just make a spiritual successor under a different name. The main thing a game takes to make is time and there have been multiple fan projects to remake CT, there's been the Crimson Echoes project, etc... Clearly people are prepared to work for a long time on it but they keep doing CnD-bait and getting shut down. A new IP with the same mechanics is all thats necessary to fill the void without bothering a classic."

The reason it's shelved as a franchise is it was such an extreme project in terms of all the individual dedication that Yasunori Mitsuda composed himself sick, literally, to give what he felt the project deserved which is why Nobuo Uematsu had to fill in at the end. They'll never top this game but they really also dont need to, imo.

I really dont want to see a Chrono Trigger franchise. Chrono Cross and Radical Dreamers added a bit of story to the picture but it really wasnt necessary at all. The DS version tacked on a bit more directly but it felt more like a few selfcontained DLC missions.

Also, updating your BIOS may solve the issue if none of the above does but dont concern yourself with that until you know the other stuff doesnt work since we dont know how stable your system is at the moment and accidentally messing up a bios flash isnt a fun day."

overclocking,faf1cjv,t1_faeg3ty,1576012466.0,is there anything to think about when doing this in terms of how i configure it? how low can i run the multipliers? it would be great to have longer battery so i can play games for longer on long trips. c:
overclocking,faf0w94,t1_faeomoi,1576012199.0,"throttlestop is a free program that does this based on the settings i apply? this would be really useful since i can play emulated games and older titles like diablo 2, etc without worrying about performance taking a hit."
overclocking,fae8gsu,t1_fae82vy,1575995943.0,Oh cool. It's mainly for longer trips by car or train where im able to use it but not charge you know. An hour extra is a lot in those situations.
pcmasterrace,fae3rf2,t3_e8nvpg,1575993066.0,"If you are doing hardtube it's trickier but softtubing is really simple and pretty damn hard to manage a leak with. However, it's mainly useful if you have plenty of radiator surfacearea and good fans and for me I've seen the most difference with GPU performance. My 2080Ti runs at +160 MHz core and 750 MHz memory and peaks at 45c playing pretty much anything. My CPU does pretty great too though running at roughly 65-67c at 1.45V and +700 MHz core and +600 mhz cache.

I think what I like most about custom loop is just building it in general. It's fun to think out the logic of where to fit everything, measure tubing (or the pipes), etc. It's a lot of work but once its up and running you maybe switch the liquid out once or twice a year and you're good."
overclocking,fae2ano,t1_fadztwq,1575992146.0,"Hmm, I haven't changed the multipliers. Not sure thats even possible via XTU on that model but loss of performance would be a bit painful since its just a 2c4t.

It's good to know that I can get a bit more battery out of a mobile device. I'm considering getting a midrange gaming machine in the future and docking it at home so I can play at friends places or at home in multi with my desktop too."

overclocking,f9g16rk,t1_f9fg75g,1575291156.0,"The cores on a CPU are essentially the amount of parallell processing capacity it has available. Most consumer CPUs have two logical threads that handle instructions for every one physical core on the actual cpu itself. So thats the Cores x GHz bit specifying that his CPU has 8 cores, 16 threads and operates at 4.4 GHz clockfrequency, essentially amount of instructions over a given amount of time.

The points that are shown up top there is the score that Cinebench gives based on how fast your CPU completes a specific task that is set up and run identically either using every core available or using only one core. The score for all your cores is a good reference point for knowing how well your CPU stacks up against others when doing work such as rendering and other highly scaleable workloads while the single core score is a good reference for knowing how quick and smooth your general Windows and application use is.

In this case, a single core score of 506 is on par with a stock speed i9 9900 KS which is great but the real win is the very high multicore score indicating that it will make short work of demanding workloads.

My own 6700k (4 cores, 8 threads at 4.7 GHz) will get about 487 single core and 2450-ish multicore. Cinebench is great to get a good idea of how much you improved your CPU if you OC and just in general to get a hard number on how well it performs compared to others at stock or overclocked speeds.

Hope this helped. c:"

overclocking,f910yxm,t1_f90yngc,1574980483.0,"Well, I believe the highest recommended ""safe"" voltage is 1.35 (or even 1.325 I think some say). Technically, you could probably run higher voltage if you have some serious cooling and get higher stable OCs but outside the safe areas damage can occur. Start at the top, 1.35v with a LLC that minimizes your droop. If you can run it stable, keep lowering it by like 0.01v until you hit instability. Thats usually how I go about it anyway."
intel,f8zbkgs,t1_f8z8asw,1574959267.0,Primarily gaming performance. My current 6700k works fine so I'm not pressed for an upgrade. Zen 2 would be fun but a 3600X probably wont give a massive lift for gaming and it also doesnt scale well with high speed ram. Intel 9th gen is a frying pan and 10th gen is turning out like crap. So I'll hold off until the next gen. Hopefully DDR5 is established then and I can get a nice lift on all fronts.
intel,f8v5vn9,t1_f8v4f8x,1574860542.0,I feel like that will be way too late. If AMD releases on schedule that means Zen 3 is well established by then.

overclocking,f8t1509,t1_f8shwib,1574793538.0,"i have a custom loop with three radiators (420 x 30, 240 x 30 and 140 x 86) and I use Noctua iPPC fans to cool it so temps aren't really an issue. 4.6 all core is possible on a 3600X within safe voltages? Thats gotta be a pretty lucky roll tho, right?"
overclocking,f8shtfq,t1_f8sgdpp,1574781070.0,My 2080 Ti is at 45c at peak with +160 MHz in the custom loop so I'm guessing I can get solid speeds then. CPU idle is like 25 to 28 c.
overclocking,f8sbz3i,t1_f8sbkle,1574776526.0,"Ok, so the 3600/3600X should be able to reach 4.2 on all cores and hopefully more if I can cool it properly. Do you know a good site to see OC score results in one or more good benchmarks? userbenchmarks has gone to shit and is intel biased as hell now so it's pretty much useless. :c"
Amd,f8sbmo0,t1_f8sazsv,1574776227.0,"The program I use, Renoise, can pretty much run with as many threads as you have but right now on my 6700k at 4.4ghz, it usually peaks at like 10-15% using my external sound interface ASIO driver rather than direct sound. So 8 threads overclocked from a first gen 14nm vs 12 threads of current gen 7nm with better IPC and god knows what else... overclocked too cause my current system has a bracket for ryzen sockets so I can keep using my custom loop on either.

The real thing that keeps me going back and forth is whether or not higher clockspeeds are what I want to go for or not with my next build. It seems less and less valuable vs the efficiency of instructions per clock and the amount of workload that can be shard across threads which is hopefully becoming more prevalent in development of any sort of app. The 3600X is obviously not as fast as the 3900X or 3950X but then its also like 50% or 33% of the price respectively."
Amd,f8sa2uz,t1_f8s9s0f,1574774833.0,"Oh ok. So performance wise, a 3600/3600X will give nearly the same performance for gaming then? Afaik, 12 threads is way more than any game really utilizes. I also have a custom-loop so I can cool it pretty efficiently too which will likely give me somewhat higher clockspeeds."

Amd,f87m3p4,t1_f87giig,1574336897.0,How effectively does it scale across the cores? Can it delegate workloads that utilize the individual threads identically or is it more like with GPUs where there are diminishing returns the more of them are involved?
Amd,f87chv7,t3_dz8lx2,1574326038.0,"To play devils advocate here, I'm guessing that the 64-core / multicore test being moved down to ""Nice to haves"" is due to it being less relevant for most peoples needs. It's only with proper scaling software like rendering and running virtual machines that you really utilize that level of hardware properly. However, its not for userbenchmark to shepherd its users toward one device or the other. They should just give us raw data comparisons. Notebookcheck has a great way of just picking whatever lineup of cpus you want and specific benchmarks to compare results of. That for all hardware would be much better.

When it comes to the 8 cores on a 9700k being faster than 8 cores on a 3950k, the only way I can see that being remotely logical is if they run a 1:1 ratio of threads per core since the 9700k is faster if thats the case.

This is still disheartening though as I just want a good benchmark comparison site to use and preferably as granular as possible."

AcerOfficial,f85aum8,t1_f84ynlp,1574271335.0,"I looked up your laptop and it supports 2400 MHz memory. Acers manual did not actually specify anything about its RAM support that I could see. It only has one slot though so you will have to buy a single 16 gb stick for optimum performance.

So to sum up, you need one DDR4 or LPDDR4 stick of SODIMM RAM thats 2400 MHz in speed and 16 GB in size to get the best performance in that machine.

EDIT: SODIMM can also be found as 260-pin DDR4 ram."
AcerOfficial,f84crj9,t3_dyxd9r,1574241527.0,"You will need DDR4 SODIMM so it actually fits the laptop. However, depending on your laptop model, it may support different speeds so you might save some money buying non XMP ram if it doesnt support it anyway. Also, LPDDR4 would be worth considering since it will net you longer lasting batteryusage.

Anyway, check what exact model your laptop is. Should say so on the manual or on the bottom of the laptop itself (sticker with model, serialnumber, etc)."
