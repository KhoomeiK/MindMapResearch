exjw,fpiupif,t3_gdm8dt,1588649149.0,"Most people who write literature instead of go to your door do so because they can‚Äôt physically go out to witness. Meaning the weird hand writing either means it was a child or someone who is disabled. Just btw! But it‚Äôs easy to get put on a do not call list. Just let the closet one to you know, or even if they show up to your door, you can just say ‚Äúplease put me on your do not call list‚Äù and they won‚Äôt ever knock again."
weddingshaming,fpiu3a9,t3_gdfx56,1588648744.0,I would leave my s/o if they did this to me no matter who it is. If they didn‚Äôt think it was wrong they wouldn‚Äôt have kept it a secret. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Why why why would someone think that‚Äôs a good idea
BPD,fo172vd,t3_g533kd,1587427081.0,Yeah I haven‚Äôt ever had an episode in front of my bf i don‚Äôt think he realizes how seriously sick I am :/
AskReddit,fnjn4se,t3_g1u0ex,1587002494.0,"I once had a fuck boy request split checks in his reservation notes for his tinder date. He checked in with me while she was in the restroom to make sure I saw the note. Over heard him talking about taking her back to his place 5 minutes into the date, 

And you best believe I sent that check unsplit and handed it to him in his hand."
BPD,fmfbkax,t3_fuu57l,1586023828.0,"Feeling invalid & left out will be a constant challenge when it comes to BPD. Our emotions in our  interpersonal relationships are heightened in a way that picks up any social cues and uses them to feed our already existing insecurities. It‚Äôs like living within a bubble and the more your emotions control you, the thicker the walls seem the most disconnected, disliked you‚Äôll feel from those you want to be accepted by. On good days, it probably feels unnoticeable and feel like you belong or validated in being like and having a secure role in friendships & the world. The one thing that helped me stay out of the bubble within disconnecting from people or feeling insecure was to either validate myself and show my self the self love/attention I was craving (I.e wanting to be heard by a loved one ->> taking the time to write down my own thoughts and feelings to satisfy my own need first before putting it on someone else). You have to remember most people aren‚Äôt going to understand why you‚Äôre asking for reassurance. You just have to change that reality for yourself, find friends that make you feel welcomed, loved unconditionally, and do little things like text you first. I promise they exist, and that you have plenty of options to fit in by finding a new source of friendship :) take the time to bond and open your heart to people. You never know who you‚Äôll meet. Just some
Advice since I struggle with this the most! Sorry if I used any language that makes you feel misunderstood. I hope you have a good day."

zoloft,flw45d9,t3_frgcjo,1585539172.0,"Exercise, as well as masturbating consistently with just yourself, making sure to visualize and stay stimulated. Zoloft made it so that I never was the one to be first in the mood but I could still actually enjoy having sex with my boyfriend at the time."
zoloft,eubhk8p,t3_cfmn9g,1563648243.0,"You‚Äôre not supposed to drink on anti depressants. Alcohol is a LONG term depressant that lasts in your system. It will sink you much deeper than without anti depressants, but in a way that isn‚Äôt noticeable at first. I would highly recommend not drinking. You‚Äôre undoing the work Zoloft is trying to do in your body in plain terms."
BPD,etnwiwb,t3_ccjchq,1563003013.0,"This has totally changed my life. I feel like I‚Äôm putting glasses on for the first time. It‚Äôs so crazy to see myself finally and what is at the core of having bpd. A false sense of identity. If you can stabilize this, it will prevent you from choosing the behavior associated with the character or show. Meaning you won‚Äôt act out in an episode. I feel like I just got my little totem like the movie inception. Wow."
