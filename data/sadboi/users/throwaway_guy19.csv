I realized that whether or not I wanted to be around people, I had to socialize to not feel lonely. It's a very simple answer but difficult to actualize. Often I feel lonely even with people, and so it then becomes a mission of finding the *right* people; those who I feel complete comfort with, who I can call a real and true friend.

I only have found those people through putting myself out into the world. It's quite contradictory for me to find people so fascinating when I'm so afraid of them. But I think I would rather face my fears and see what comes of it than suffer my loneliness endlessly."

offmychest,f941pcj,t1_f9407kz,1575074720.0,"Hey! I'm happy to share and I'm really really glad this gives you hope.

It's hard to answer your question because treatment for depression and anxiety is unique for everyone and each person responds differently. However it's a fact that both are highly treatable. I too kept losing progress and hitting a rough spot; in fact, this time three months ago I was incredibly depressed, but medication changed everything. The reason it took me so long to get to this point was because I had to keep trying different things until I figured out what solution worked best.

You just have to keep going. Always keep going. If something isn't working, change it up, and keep doing that until something works. For self-esteem, try combining meditation with positive affirmations. I take a few minutes a day to be in the present moment and tell myself that I am enough. You don't need to have any sort of drive, you just need to take action. I've learned the hard way that only through doing things without thinking will I make any progress. You can't be resistant to any treatment, you should be open to everything because your solution could be a unique combination of things.

I know it's disheartening to think about because it means you have to put the work in. But as dumb as it sounds, that's one fundamental rule of life: you have to put work in to see results. It's true whether or not someone has a mental illness. It applies to everything. Keep pushing, keep hunting, because even if it takes till the end of your life for you to be completely content for five years before you die, you'll cherish those years more than anything else in the world.

If you need more help, please PM me, I'd be more than happy to share my experience with you more."

But that's exactly why I'm building up my self-esteem. I shouldn't expect someone to want to go out with me just because I want to go out with them.
