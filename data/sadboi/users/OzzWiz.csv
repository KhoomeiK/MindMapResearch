LetsTalkMusic,fho4a7p,t3_f135v3,1581740983.0,"I use Spotify and make weekly playlists up to 10 hours long of what i had discovered. If its something I'll be listening to over and over again - for albums, I'll favorite the album to my library; for songs, I have a playlist for both all time favorites and monthly synopsis. Sometimes I'll favorite songs directly but that's usually if the internet is too slow to immediately add to a playlist after which I'd go back and add it.

I also have a playlist of albums recommended to me, albums to listen to, saving the first song to it. When I want to hear something new I shuffle that playlist and upon completion, delete the lead track from the playlist."

aspergers,fguazz3,t3_f0cdjt,1581116481.0,"No. Not at first. After about 5 months at my current job, which is just me and my boss in a small warehouse, I told him because it seemed necessary at the time. We talk to each other a lot so I felt comfortable telling him partially because I'm pretty sure he has some sort of something himself. Usually I would never though. It would be too much of a risk. There is still stigma around. Society is not at the point where an employer wouldnt think twice yet"
aspergers,fguar2n,t3_ezzf9s,1581116316.0,The police are quite the opposite. They usually absolutely no clue how to deal with people like us. I got pulled over a while ago and was shaking and tapping my fingers on the steering wheel so the cop asked me why I seem afraid. I told him I was an aspie and luckily he understood a bit so didnt make me get out and search the car. But usually they are not educated on how to handle aspies
aspergers,fguahc2,t3_f03x3c,1581116138.0,"Yes! Totally me. I've had different special interests throughout my childhood and into my teens and whenever one would stick for a nice couple years or even months I'd garner as much info about the subject possible and somehow it'd stick. NTs actually found it pretty fascinating. The ones who cared about the subject at least lol, the others just wanted me to shut up. As of now, and I dont think that'll change for a while, I'm obsessed with music, all genres. I've basically got a music encyclopedia in my head. Some people appreciate it and a friend brags about it to other people, makes me feel kinda good to get the attention. It takes a lot of time, more like all my time, but for me it's worth it"
aspergers,fgua3xb,t3_f0fktl,1581115894.0,Yes. I still havent come to terms with the way I look - it simply doesn't feel right. I know how I feel but my outside looks dont resonate at all. My voice as well. It seems alien to me
aspergers,fgu9z5g,t1_fgthilj,1581115807.0,"Same here, every day. It used to bug me a lot so I practically stopped looking in the mirror and stay away from cameras and selfies as much as I can to try to simply ignore it and walk around freely without having that on my mind"
aspergers,fgu9sf9,t3_f0acf7,1581115685.0,"Most definitely. I had practically given up on meeting new NTs altogether. I wish I knew other aspies because I think it'd be a lot easier on first impressions and understanding each other. I did meet a NT girl who was completely open and didn't mind me being an aspie until she stopped answering my texts. I'm convinced it's because of something I unintentionally said, something which I still haven't figured out. But I do feel like people jump to the conclusion that we're unlikable and dont even give it a try, and it definitely sucks. They fail to realize that there is a complete human beneath us too and it is possible for them to connect and appreciate us just as they would a NT if they'd give the time to understand"
aspergers,fgu9fbs,t3_f0ebby,1581115446.0,"Yes. I'm not sure if it's an aspie problem per se though. I could be wrong though. For me it could be a lot more than resentment; I still cannot even be in the same room as people who did stuff to me over a decade ago and if I manage to talk to them, I always have the image in my head of whatever it is they had done"
aspergers,fgu97fx,t3_f0i73b,1581115300.0,"I wish I did and I'd love to get some. I'm 19 and have only dated once for about a month, didnt last - it was just too much to handle for me. Body language is extremely important and I found myself having a really hard time even making eye contact which obviously complicates things a lot. 

I wish you good luck though! Anything is possible. Maybe try finding an aspie guy so the issue is mutual and theres less of a need to focus on those things on both ends."
aspergers,ffuye2g,t1_ffux8f3,1580251712.0,"Of course. She seemed to really appreciate me for a person though. She told me that I calmed her down a lot. I dont think someone who I'm on the bottom of the list for would have any reason to say something like that. That's why it's so confusing that she suddenly ghosted me.

aspergers,ffuwdrc,t1_ffuur0i,1580250601.0,"I totally relate to that. For that exact reason, I only have about 3 friends. They're all weird in their own way so those stuff dont really bother them."
aspergers,ffuvvzb,t1_ffuuyz0,1580250331.0,"This is a great answer, thank you. I totally relate to the idea you brought up where we could be extremely nice and helpful to a person of the opposite sex - to the point where the other person automatically thinks we have other interests and then puts us aside. We want to have a deeper and more emotional relationship but most guys who act that way just want to get in their pants  so they get confused and turned off. This is exactly what I think is happening with this girl I posted about. She may have got turned off by me asking how her day was and all that stuff which literally no other guy friends have ever and will ever ask her."
aspergers,ffutnzq,t1_ffure11,1580249129.0,"As long as you dont feel the need to have friends that's great, do what makes you happy.

aspergers,ffubbir,t1_ffuabqq,1580238382.0,"Even if that's true and she never initiates contact, that puts a huge load on an aspie like myself because although I could technically initiate, I dont know my limits.

aspergers,ffuabqq,t1_ffu9azl,1580237788.0,"Thanks, very well said. I was open with the person and explained my situation. She told me she never initiates contact with anyone. I guess maybe I should've seen that as a early sign."

Doesnt really sound much like 1980 either, at least I dont think so. Someone compared them to Supertramp and I guess that's a cool comparison but to me their extremely unique. Had no idea who they were when I bought the album. Ended up being one of my best listens so far. My favorite song off it is ""Shark Attack"" - put me in a trance."
