Probably not it, but it’s a great book and movie if you want to check it out.

OR is it one of the Halloween town movies? or twitches w/ tia and tamera?

Actually, now that I think about it more, your description reminds me more of this movie.. 


[now you see it] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_You_See_It)

SO your choices are to have two red eyes, one red eye and one normal one, or no red eyes but a cute black dot in one that you hope no one notices. this used happen to me allllll the time as a blue eyed girl who used flash for every pic in middle/high school with the oldest iPhones lol"

I have very fine thin hair and have used it as a cowash, mask, leave in conditioner, and detangler! No silicones or sulfates, these products are what inspired me to start the cg method a few months ago :)"
BadMUAs,fdome05,t3_emeowf,1578608094.0,"-Concealer is too light. 
-Blush and contour/bronzer are not blended. 
-Eyebrows aren’t done- which can be fine- but looks odd with a dark, heavy smoky eye and a full face otherwise.
-Lashes are too large, in my opinion. 
-Foundation color is a little bit off from her neck (too orange?) from what I can see. 

And lastly, but NUMBER ONE, this is definitely edited/facetuned. 
Her skin texture is blurred in some parts, but left just enough unedited to keep it looking “real”. I’m also questioning the nose because I too have a small nose but the nose:lip ratio looks a little too perfect.  See r/Instagramreality"

Then it’s started to fall out in patches just like this, along with my eyebrows.  I was diagnosed at age five after a punch biopsy and some blood work. The doctor at mayo was convinced it was Trichotillomania because I clearly had anxiety already. Alopecia areata and hypothyroidism. They put me on a steroid cream for a couple of years. It grew back. Maybe because of puberty? 20 years later I’m glad my mom pushed for that biopsy. The past few years it has came back off and on, getting a little worse each time as stress comes and goes. I have got steroid injections in my scalp this last two (and only) recent dermatologist appointments and am waiting fo see it those improve or worsen the hair loss. Sorry about the long winded response, hope this helps at all- and good luck to you and your son :)"
