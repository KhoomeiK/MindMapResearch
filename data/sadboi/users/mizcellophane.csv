French,fmm3n02,t3_fw290j,1586198174.0,">Also from what I understand in France in particular, not working in the field you‚Äôve studied / talking about transferable skills isn‚Äôt a thing either. If you want a change in career or do something different you‚Äôd have to go back to school. They take the diplomas you‚Äôve studied very seriously. 

Not exactly. If no specific diploma is necessary to do the job you're applying for, then it doesn't matter. If you want to work as a nurse, obviously you need a nursing school diploma, but most job offers don't even mention a specific field of studies. 
However, a certain level might be required (bac+3, bac+5).

But really, you shouldn't censor yourself. Look at the jobs, look at the requirements, apply. You have experience, and not any kind: experience *abroad*. This is something that will definitely get recruiters' attention. 
Also don't forget Belgium and Switzerland."

Don't get me wrong, this guy fucked up and it's a good thing OP told him personally what he thinks. 

But claiming he's bound to repeat the same mistake and can't change is judgmental and wrong, IMO. No one can tell what the future holds, and I think people can change and learn and make amends.

ADHD,fg4cqxr,t3_ewoi7c,1580500986.0,"Here's a few tips that I use, I hope it helps and that I'm not out of place:

First, take time to acknowledge how you feel (stressed, overwhelmed, maybe low self-esteem) and express it in a way that doesn't hurt you or someone else. This is important. 

Then, list the things and put them in an [Eisenhower matrix](https://luxafor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Eisenhower-Decision-Matrix-png.png).
* Urgent means that something is time-bonded and cannot be done after a set time, and that it's close to now.
* Important means that it will still matter in a month, a year, 10 years. Everything else is not important (at least that's how it works for me). 

Start by delegating the urgent-unimportant and erasing the non-urgent-unimportant, so that you can get stuff off your list faster.

You've already done a lot, so you can take a break, and start planning the rest afterwards.

If something left on the matrix feels overwhelming, too big, too much or too late, it's OK to ask for outside help. For example: ""Hey, this thing is hard for me to start, what do you think I should do first to begin working on it?"" or ""Hey, could you help me break this down in simpler, manageable tasks?""

Hope it helps."

Maybe they make a mean mac&cheese or they always know what to say when you're down. Try to focus on what makes them unique, and not comparing to the shiny new partner. Keep the list at hand. 

Make time for them, too. Plan a regular date night with your primary, during which you're not in contact with your other partner (phone locked in another room if necessary). Ask them what they'd like to do with you (movies, Netflix, walk in the parc, distraction-free listening, etc.) and *do it*. Maybe you'll be thinking about the other partner and only want to talk about them, but if you're committed to your primary, make time for them anyway.

If you don't know it already, find out their love language (there's 5 of them and it's a veeeery useful tool), and try to express your affection in a way they'll be receptive to. 

If you're struggling with simply thinking about them, I suggest using an alarm (""reminder: say 'I love you') or an app like Love Nudge. They can help you remind your primary partner you still want to be with them."
