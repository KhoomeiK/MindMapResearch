PanicAttack,f6pmc4p,t3_dsg2nm,1573059505.0,"Yes, recently I've been waking up straight into my heart racing and a full blown panic attack on and off throughout the week. It really messes with my morning routine because I'm pacing around the house freaking out for like 30 mins, heart racing, muscle shakes, racing thoughts, and then I feel exhausted and just want to get back into bed (like I just ran a half marathon or something). 

Usually I'll climb into a cold shower and that will reduce my heart beat and kind of calm the physical symptoms (that along with some deep breathing exercises my therapist showed me). 

Hell of a way to start the day though, I hate it :("

depression,f5vjs6r,t3_dpadbk,1572491076.0,"I felt, and sometimes still feel, that way for a loooong time. Life is weird in that it’ll start moving forward when you least expect it, whether it be someone you meet by pure chance, a new hobby you never knew you’d like/have (for me it is jogging, volunteering, and playing PokemonGo), or finding out what you want (or definitely don’t want) to do career wise through failure. That’s not going to happen if you’re just wallowing in self pity and depression, and I know it’s not easy and depending on how bad your condition is it might be a daily struggle (I have very good days and very very bad days when I don’t even wanna get out of bed) but you can’t win a battle you never even try to fight. Just keep on going, eventually you’ll find something that’ll move you forward onto the next phase or at least fall assbackwards into something new, weird, and exciting."

Anxiety,f295zvp,t3_dclnzl,1570082174.0,"I guess I was kind of in the same boat, and in some ways still am. Everybody you know, even those that seem to lead more successful, stable lives have probably felt the same way at some point, they just may have not dealt with the added hurdle of suffering from some form of anxiety disorder. It’s not like you get an envelope in the mail at some point in your life saying “Hey welcome to adulthood! Sign up for the newsletter to get a free shirt!” it just kind of comes around whether you are ready or not. The way I see it is that you can’t compare your own life journey to those of other people, you’ll just drive yourself crazy and never feel good enough no matter what you do. We are all on our own paths on this crazy ride, some of us are just taking the scenic route. What you can do, and what has helped me, is focusing on the small things you can do now to help you achieve your goals and get/feel better. Eventually (whether you realize it or not) those little changes will add up to a big change in your life. So get out of bed, put on some pants, and go live your life. Not gonna lie dude, it’s going to be uncomfortable, scary, overwhelming, weird, and downright shitty at times out there but it’s also going to be a lot of fun along the way if you let it. You only get one shot at this kid, no reason to sit on the sideline and let it pass by."
