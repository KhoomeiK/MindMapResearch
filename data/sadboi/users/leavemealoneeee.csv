-Jimmie Johnson of course. He’s such a great role model and my kids adore him. 
-Chase Elliott.. He’s just a cool dude. 

Drivers I hate... Hate is such a strong word. I definitely don’t care for Stenhouse Jr, Austin Dillon, or Joey Logano. 

Love / Hate would be Brad K and Kyle Busch. I love Brad’s patriotism and respect for fans and media, he’s just a thoughtful guy. I also love Kyle’s passion for racing, although I hate when he whines and acts like a child. 

As far as announcers go I still miss Boogity boogity boogity. I know everyone hated that but it feels strange not hearing it this season.. lol. Rick Allen drives me nuts though. If I have to hear him throat scream at the end of a race one more time I might drive my car off a cliff. Ugh."
