You'll hit the paywalls fast though, I ended up buying a 1 month membership because I started on my old wizard at level 19 and got to 29 within a few days. The servers are pretty busy, I don't know if they've always been like this or if it's because of quarantine but there are plenty of new and old players. I'm not very good, but people are willing to help out. There's also a new feature where you can just team up with people for dungeons at a little kiosk by the bazaar instead of waiting for people to show up to the actual dungeon at the same time as you. I'd definitely recommend playing again if you're bored, if you make a new account you might have more time before the paywalls, but if your returning on an old account there might not be a lot you can do."

There are a lot of people that make careers from trashing other people, Perez Hilton, Tyra banks (she ran a MLM and fucked her fans over big time) and she completely humiliated the girls on ATM, literally ANY drama channel on YouTube. So many assholes, but the views and attention are what keep them going. People just need to flat out ignore them and let them dwindle away, even saying that they suck is still giving them attention.

The last trip both of my parents were home and I did it at 9pm both times. My mom got up in the middle of me peaking and started making SO MUCH NOISE in the kitchen around 2am, I really thought I was going to have a heart attack, my ears made it sound like she was outside of my door when she hadn't gone near my room but the sound echoed up. Then around 7am they both got up and were loud as fuck for the rest of the morning. I accidentally sent myself into a bad trip around 630am because I hit a dab thinking I was so far on the comedown I would be fine, it made me peak all over again and I was terrified it wouldn't go away. I just laid in my bed overcome by the worst anxiety I've ever had because I was starting to get auditory hallucinations, I kept hearing my doorknob being turned, or someone walking up my stairs when nobody did. After I realized it was just my head I calmed down more but for the last few hours, paranoid doesn't even describe it, I was on the verge of throwing up and crying from the anxiety during the last few hours.

I like the full town overview that the sims 3 maps give, the sims 4 map makes the towns look halfass made and really small. Honestly the world WAS just really small, and disappointing. 

I also started seeing a ton of stuff packs, and expansions right off the bat. I know that's a sims franchise thing but the sims 4 went too far. You have to pay so much for bare necessities, the $5 base game sale makes sense when you realize all of the shit is in the packs. 

Oh and then after my first time playing, I had gotten a new phone and lost my email. Couldn't log into my EA account, so even though I did buy the sims 4, I can't play it anymore. I got to play it once and the first impression wasn't impressive.

I do really like the new customization in character making, not the traits, but how you can morphe certain features a lot more. The CC is a lot better. But it's just not worth it imo, the base of sims 3 is enough to play as is, and I don't think the sims 4 can really match it. Sims 4 seemed like a big money grab instead of a push to improve their game."

My legs are skinny, weight skips them and goes to my torso, but somehow my inner thighs are covered in stretch marks. My stomach has them going from my pelvis up to my belly button in vertical lines, hips too, when I have the most narrow hips, my arms got chubby but not HUGE, covered in them still, and my back has big ass stretch marks going across horizontally.

If you want to try again when it grows out, have someone use guards 1, 2, and 3 on you going up the back and sides to about the top of your ear or higher if you want it shorter, then scissors JUST on top, if you trust someone with scissors again, look up how to hold scissors and hair for a ""men's scissor over comb"" they might have just dug right into your hair with them instead of angled, idk how but maybe.

It's really hard to know it's bad until someone tells you, and usually people just take to social media instead of flat out telling her ""hey you've got the wrong shade, you might want to match yourself next time"". I'm not bashing for posting her because Ik big influencers do get told to fix their bad matches but they just don't listen. 

I have yet to find a perfect match, my first try was with too faced, I was one of the lightest 5 shades but they matched me to VANILLA, I wore that god awful peanut butter yellow for like 3 years and didn't listen to anyone because ""Sephora employees know better"" WELL THEY DONT. Match yourself. I have really red undertones, but most pale foundations look yellow. Idk I have a lot of sympathy when I see super pale people with bad matches. I know it's not as bad as the shade ranges for darker skin tones, but there is definitely a gap in the market for most brands when it comes to the really fair tones."

I can't go back into schools anymore, it sends me into absolute panic. Im 19 and I still have nightmares about the school somehow finding a way to make me come back.

It's hard to describe the specific little things they would do because saying; everytime I sat near them they would all get up and move as far away as possible, doesn't really sound THAT bad but when you put EVERYTHING else they would do with that on a daily basis, life became absolutely miserable I had no friends, nobody would speak to me, nobody would look at me without giving me dirty looks, I felt like a fucking monster.

I think the main issue was the processing, it looks like your curls are under processed or whatever solution you used just wasn't right for your hair type. Brands try to advertise hair stuff as one size fits all when it just doesn't work that way."
Wellthatsucks,fokxjox,t1_fokvxd4,1587850846.0,"If you're looking to save money, just wait until things get better and start opening up. Cosmetology schools do pretty good perms, I go to Paul mitchell and we have 3 different formulas and do regular and spiral (most likely what you were trying). Just give your hair a break over quarantine and if you want to see if they can fix it, it would be your safest and cheapest option. Just make sure you're completely honest about what you've put on it. 

If you don't want to perm it again, I really don't think you should buzz it. Your hair is just in shock right now because you've completely changed the texture. I would definitely just give it a break for a while (idk how fast your hair grows). It really doesn't look that bad, but I know it's not what you want. 

Another thing I thought of was over/under processing. How long did you leave the waving solution on, and how long did you leave the neutralizer on? Also rinsing, people don't think it's that important but it is, we have an entire rule around it. For regular perms at least you have to rinse with the hottest water you can take for 5 mins, and if their hair is longer than 5 inches every inch add another minute of rinsing. If you do it wrong the perm solution won't get fully rinsed out and 1. Your hair will stink. 2. There are still strong chemicals lingering in your hair and that's obviously not good for it. That's the biggest thing new students mess up on with perms, 19 steps is a lot but it gets drilled into your head."

Even when it gets to suicide it seems like everyone involved tries their hardest to sweep it under the rug and blame mental illness. I always see schools trying to cover their asses after suicide from bullying. Schools always protect the bullies no matter what. If I have kids I honestly won't be able to send them to school in fear of a repeat, schools help that kind of behavior thrive, teachers egg it on. I've never felt more alone and unwanted than I did in school. I never had friend groups, I never really had friends in general. Growing up I had 1 or 2 at a time but that was it and they never stayed. When shit hit the fan the one friend I did have was friends with the perpetrators, he expressed how much what they were doing bothered him but literally never said a word. Not once. I never had someone sticking up for me or even helping me. He would just watch and act uncomfortable and then talk about it when they went away. It's really hard to not hold a grudge against him. I have a horribly hard time trusting people. They ruined me. I don't feel like I even have a personality anymore. My brain is fried."

I know they genuinely don't care, it's just for the check. I feel like I'm better off talking to my dog for free and having no response than talking to someone who couldn't give 2 shits about me and is literally only speaking to me because it's their job, I can't open up to someone I know doesn't care. They can say they care all they want but at the end of the day, I'm still alone. They wouldn't speak to me if I wasn't paying. I would rather just be alone than feel like the only human relationship I have is solely reliant on money, it feels shitty, it feels worse than being completely alone. I just need to get out of the south. I know it won't solve everything but at least I won't be somewhere I genuinely hate. I just wish I had friends that actually cared. I feel like I have a ridiculous amount of borderline acquaintances that only speak to me when they want shit. I've been out of school and at home for 7 weeks now I haven't had human contact with someone unrelated to me since. The only people that speak to me are plugs. My cousin was my best friend but she's kind of forgotten about me, same with my best friend in Washington, we talk but it's like a sentence a day if that. I feel like everyone is just trying to forget about me, and doing a great job at it. I definitely feel forgotten and honestly feel like if I died they wouldn't even know. People at school definitely wouldn't give a shit. The only people that I could see actually impacted is my parents and my dog, that's it. I'm stuck under the radar.

ptsd,fojg954,t1_fojfdu5,1587820042.0,"Therapy has gone pretty horrible so far. It took nearly a year just to get in, and get diagnosed by a nurse practitioner. Then they would only see me once every 3 weeks for like 45 mins. The therapist added literally nothing to what I said, she just confirmed ""yeah that would give anyone ptsd"". I would go in, open up, and come out in shambles because literally all it did was make me relive it infront of a stranger. 3 appointments and I was done. They kept pushing group therapy but I'm going to be honest the facility seemed like it catered towards very very bad off patients and not people like me just needing someone to talk to. There was constant screaming, bad smells, people wandering around rambling to other people in the lobby. I hated going. I hated the environment. It felt more like a psych ward. I've never been institutionalized and it's always been a massive fear. So when they kept pushing group therapy:

1. Most of the people there are so far off I feel like my issues would be so minor and uncomfortable to talk about in front of them, and my regular therapy appointments already got interrupted by unruly patients so I couldn't imagine a room full would be any calmer.

2. My ptsd is from bullying, why would anyone think I would be willing to talk about it to a group of strangers. Like. You understand. It's just not it."

The therapist literally adds nothing to what I say and just confirms ""yeah that would give anyone ptsd"" ok thanks $25 well spent. They keep pushing group therapy but why would they think I would be comfortable opening up to a group of people I don't know when my ptsd is literally from bullying. I hate people. I would never fucking do that. Plus the facility I was going to seemed like it catered more to people who were so far off that people like me fell under the radar and got forgotten about. It was like if you arent THIS bad we don't care. My appointments constantly got interrupted by unruly patients. I try to sympathize but when I've waited damn near a fucking year for one appointment and some screaming asshole interrupts it and cuts the 45 minutes even shorter, I think I have a right to be pissed. I don't want to seem like I'm looking down on them because I'm not, I'm just not the most sympathetic person when I'm literally walking on the edge of sanity and bumps like these make me wobble. I would have absolutely lost it throughout quarantine if it weren't for dabs, I just got another G yesterday and I'm afraid I'll run out after.

Wellthatsucks,fojdet7,t1_foijlhn,1587817566.0,"I'm a cosmetology student and I do perms a lot, it isn't the worst I've seen but I can tell something went wrong. It's hard because I don't know what she was going for in the first place but I'm going to assume Beach waves and not ringlets. You use those flexy rods as perm rods and wrap your hair going down sideways instead of little perm rods all over the head it's like 20 big flexy rods. 

Those perms are a lot harder to do imo as is, but on short hair like hers it's kind of impossible. I really couldn't see how she even got her hair wrapped on the rods if it wasn't little perm rods. So that might have been what happened, they wrapped way too loose and unevenly because her hair is too short.

Her hair also looks kind of fried on the ends so she might have used the wrong perm for colored hair. 

When you perm your hair and use the traditional little perm rods you should have enough hair to wrap around at least twice to get a decent curl. If she used rods it looks like she could have used ones that were too big and couldn't wrap enough hair around to form a curl and just random bends in her hair instead. 

I really have no clue how she did this, I've never messed a perm up (yet) but it looks like just a mix of little mistakes that made a bad end result. Perms are the one thing I wish people just wouldn't try and do at home, it is very very very damaging to your hair and isn't that easy to do (if you do it correctly). In cosmetology school our perm has 19 steps we have to memorize. I know people at home are only following half of it if that and then wondering why it didn't turn out. Just wait. Salons will reopen at some point and stylists are praying their clients aren't at home fucking their hair up right now. Bad perms kind of aren't fixable at least for a while you have to give your hair a break or else it will literally break."

Tennessee,fofo7ly,t1_fofmhhz,1587739831.0,"Personally in Washington the kind of people I hung out with and were used to were very open minded, accepting of differences, up with this day and age you know. At least in the area I'm in now, that is a very small minority. I see a lot of confederate flags. A lot of pro trump. It was overwhelming and still is. I really don't get along with these kind of people, and that's been one of my biggest issues. But I am kind of on the edge of being in the mountains so it gets more rual. I live close to Townsend, it's beautiful but small and very country. 

If you get closer to the city, diversity is much better. I do like Knoxville, some parts can be kind of rough though. It really depends on where you go, but the smaller the town is the more close mindedness you will get. I know you said you don't like the city very much, I get that, I'm kind of the opposite though I like the noise, fast pace, I hate being somewhere where I know everyone and everyone knows me. A lot of Tennessee is like that. I don't like the small town vibe, but a lot of people do. 

The weather. Oh. My god. In Washington it rained every single day, and then was nice for like 3 weeks in the summer. Tennessee is so bipolar, one day it will snow, the next it will be 80. The last 3 years I've been here the weather changes have been so ridiculous, but I think that's just because I'm used to literally only rain everyday. 

There are so many old people here. Not like Florida but much more than you would be used to in California. 

There are very nice people here, I always have to remind myself no matter where I go there will be assholes because they are everywhere. You just have to find the right people and places. Knoxville has the nicest people I've met so far, NOT THE FRAT GUYS THOUGH. Good god the UT frat guys are AWFUL."
Tennessee,fofajru,t3_g720xw,1587731212.0,"I'm originally from Washington state so I'm used to a similar pace. California is different in its own ways, but the west coast is pretty fast in general.

I moved here at 16 3 years ago with my family (honestly due to bullying) so the move wasn't like the normal happy excited for a new start. At that point I had taken such an emotional beating I was ready for it to be over, I didn't trust that it would be a good move because nothing in my life has gone to plan so far. 

So I've really only been to Knoxville and East Tn because that's where we live now, I have no clue how the rest of Tennessee is so this is my PERSONAL experience for this area, I know a lot of people fall head over heels for this state and this is my opinion. Don't come for me please lol. 

Education here is very very very very behind compared to California. I've gone to 9 different schools, west coast, Midwest, and south. The west coast has the best education, best funded, and leaned towards actually teaching children and not just preparing to take state tests for funding. I came to Tennessee middle of junior year, if you have children I might honestly suggest online or REALLY doing your research when it comes to the school you send them to. My town has 3 schools, one very nice highschool right in the middle, a rough one on one side, and a redneck one on the other. Guess which one ms west coast ended up at? The kids hated me. I had a ridiculously hard time making friends. I ended up dropping October of senior year and finishing online. The education at this school (heritage) was an absolute joke. I legitimately learn more from a SamOnella video on YouTube than I did from a year of being there, I might have even gotten dumber. The curriculum was all geared towards good scores on state tests, not actually retaining knowledge. I understand this is how it is for the most part everywhere, but that was literally all they cared about. They will let anyone graduate whether they are ready or not. If you flunk you will be held back on the west coast, here it seems like they push you along so they don't have to deal with you. So keep that in mind if you're coming with kids. 

The pace of California compared to Tennessee is night and day, you will have a big culture shock. It is an overwhelming red state, I know counties are different but where I live it is a majority. Older white republicans. People here do everything slow, talk slow, move slow, they don't drive slow though but California driving is much worse, but if you get sucked into a conversation with a true Tennessean, it will last for as long as you let it, they are masters at small talk and will not stop. In Washington, and I assume the same for California, you didn't speak to strangers. You just don't do it. It's weird. For a better lack of words everyone had blinders on, you kept to yourself. Here you won't get away with that, people see those blinders as an unfriendly wall up, when it's really what I'm used to. I have a hard time getting sucked into small talk, I don't like it and I'm really bad at it. 

The amount of police is overwhelming but crime isn't that much lower. That's all I have to say. VERY overwhelming compared to the west coast. 

I know this was a bit negative, but I'm being honest I haven't had a good experience here from the west coast. I want to go back. But I know a lot of people that are absolute die hards for Tennessee so it could be the most amazing move for you, I just had bad circumstances to begin with so it really effected my view as a whole. I know a lot of people can see that and I'm not just shitting on this state because I can. I've met good people here but I've had a very hard time shifting into this change of pace and really completely change of cultures from north to south."

We're putting our fucking lives at risk just to dye some selfish bitches grey roots. You won't die if you don't get a haircut for a month. WE WILL however die if you drag the virus into the school while demanding your ""essential haircut"". People didn't stay home when they were sick before this, they won't after. They don't listen.
