offmychest,fo5omlq,t3_fx62g9,1587531054.0,"Out of all coworkers, myself and another coworker were chosen to go to off site covid screening labs  to basically table, hand off masks and sanitizer, direct patients to designated areas based on their symptoms and/ or to their car if the lab is full. PPE such as face shield and gloves would be provided to make us ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. 

If we decline, the hospital views it as refusal to work so we would have to quit on the spot and cannot receive unemployment. I just cannot fathom this. It‚Äôs ridiculous. I am a glorified data entry lab technician. I‚Äôm underpaid already. We were notified by hospital and university that the minimum wage increase would not be taking effect and we would not get hazard pay, simply because the hospital and university did not give it out during the Ebola crisis. Other team members were given opportunities to cross train in other labs and we were told we were supposed to train too, until these specific lab areas notified my supervisor they simply did not want to train us any more. 

What‚Äôs so hard about tabling? Any kind of customer or patient service is not an easy job, especially if the patient is already feeling ill. Conversations can get hostile and tense quickly. We are supposed to direct people back to their car if the waiting rooms are full. I can‚Äôt imagine not getting yelled at by someone whose questioning whether or not they have covid. I don‚Äôt want to get indirectly spat on or whatever happens when they decide to scream at me because I have to tell them they can only have one guest with them and shun away other visitors they‚Äôve brought along for support. How shitty. Not to mention my personal safety and the safety of my parents and younger siblings. 
It‚Äôs all fear based. The unknown. 
If my coworker and I lived alone, I could understand posing this risk. But we both, one fresh out of college, I‚Äôm still in school, both living at home with immunocompromised people. This is a high risk first contact task they are forcing us to do. It‚Äôs not as simple as well you signed up for the healthcare field so this is your job. My job is accessioning. Creating and logging patient hospital accounts and ordering testing. I don‚Äôt have any patient contact. I get a sample, I track and receive specimen, I create an account number and log it and give it proper testing codes and send it off to people who know what they‚Äôre doing. One mistake, one number/ letter off can get me written up and stay on my record. 
I just don‚Äôt see how they can manipulate the situation into well you‚Äôre refusing to work so you‚Äôre terminated but actually you have to quit and you can‚Äôt use your PTO or earned vacation. Btw no hazard pay and no raise, but we pay you as much as someone who works at a fast food joint with benefits and higher risks for patient mistakes will mess your job record up with us, we won‚Äôt transfer you to a department that will train you simply bc the trainers don‚Äôt want to train, but you are essential so thank you for what you do."
depression,fn49aqf,t1_fn46krs,1586636682.0,"It‚Äôs all a learning process. You can always transfer. Don‚Äôt forget that. Starting new is scary but refreshing. This time you can go to a college you‚Äôd want. 
It‚Äôs a big step. You have these qualities that people keep you around because you‚Äôre a good friend. But let‚Äôs reverse that mindset. Finding friends will come in time but it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre recognizing signs of an opportunist."
depression,fn48cag,t3_fzc9ho,1586636123.0,"Hi Op. I think you‚Äôve done a great job writing out everything you could‚Äôve to explain your situation. 
I‚Äôll try my best to answer your questions. 

First thing I would like to say is, college isn‚Äôt for everyone. Your parents can continue to blame you for wasting their money, but they decided to give you the opportunity. They made a decision and they can‚Äôt blame you for that. You took it and it wasn‚Äôt the right fit for you. You already knew that cause it wasn‚Äôt your dream school. It sounded like you had to settle a lot.

I want to encourage you to not give up. You won‚Äôt be stuck in that shitty hometown. Your dreams aren‚Äôt too big and unrealistic. What‚Äôs hurting you is your fears. Everyone has them. Being able to write them out for a group of randoms to potentially read is very brave and shows your vulnerability. As for the social anxiety thing, I would suggest baby steps. You should never just push yourself into a situation you‚Äôll be uncomfortable in. For example, college kinda does that. A shit ton of students, professors, etc. everyone is doing their own thing and you already feel like an outsider, you know. I, myself, sometimes find myself in situations during college where I‚Äôm comparing myself to other people and then I get reallllly nervous in wanting to approach people and spark up a conversation. People are scary. But baby steps, ya know. You might notice someone with something cute and you comment and then a friendship could start. You never know. There are definitely resources like NAMI, your PCP could recommend some potential free resources (people to take to like psychiatrists or whatever group talk) and your parents won‚Äôt know bc HIPAA. Search for online resources too. At the end of they day, it‚Äôs just taking a leap of faith. If you waste money, think about it. Waste money and potentially love it or waste money and know that you hate it. Second option seems like it really sucks but you still learned that you hated it. That‚Äôs a still a win for me. There‚Äôs so many options out there for schooling. You don‚Äôt even have to go to school, you can try to search for some local art communities and start from there if you can‚Äôt commit to the idea of paying for art school. It might open up new doors for you‚Äî real life connections can lead to internships or find some really chill people you connect with. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be in person if it‚Äôs online! 

I‚Äôve also been in the situation where everyone around you is just sick of dealing with your feelings and listening. If they‚Äôre not willing to listen or give you some solid support and advice, then I‚Äôm not sure if you want to open up to those people. Sometimes the expectations of telling someone you care about that you‚Äôre hurting and expecting them to reply a certain way is unrealistic. I would recommend communicating what makes you feel like this or that and if you did this and that instead, it would make you feel better and they can offer some advice to do this or that. Like a compromise. But if they‚Äôre just unwilling to hear you out then i think it‚Äôs better to invest some time in people who are more understanding and can relate. 

The relationship with your sister, I‚Äôm not sure how else you would able to mend that relationship. I would just suggest a final reach out, state your intentions and feelings and how you want the relationship to go. If she continues to ignore you then just give her space. She might be feeling suffocated. Idk how old she is but if she‚Äôs younger, that‚Äôs tough. Give her the space and time to come to you. 

Anyway, I believe in you OP. As cliche as this sounds, you can achieve whatever you put your heart into. It won‚Äôt be sudden. Being able to leave your hometown will take some time. Make a plan: goals, dreams, etc. Prepare yourself. Grow. Gather some cash. Find some passions. Take a leap of faith. Then when you finally get out of there, it‚Äôll be so worth it. It‚Äôll be so refreshing. Your life is what you make it, honestly. These people can tear you down. They can shit on you, but as long as you fight for what you want and yourself, then you‚Äôre invincible. I know this quarantine sucks, but hope you come out stronger than ever.  Hope I helped."
depression,fn45fx5,t3_fzfwlf,1586634431.0,"Wow. I can honestly relate. I felt out of place and judged in the last friend group. I felt like they just spoke to me because of mobility access. 

Just leave this toxic group or voice your concerns. Hope you find people who will make you feel appreciated and love you for you. Just remember, you don‚Äôt need them, they need you. Don‚Äôt offer to pay or drive anyone around. And most importantly hope you love yourself enough to realize you‚Äôre just not the ugly fat friend. I always feel like the uglier and/ or the most plump friend in all my groups, but they constantly reassure me that I‚Äôm not. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about how you see yourself. I see plus size people with raging confidence and somehow they are fearless and their face and aura are glowing. I always wish to have that confidence and wonder if they have those same doubts. Best of luck :)"

One thank you is enough acknowledgement to start changing directions on this one way street. But again, she couldn‚Äôt even do that and that is when knowing your self worth also comes to play.

KDRAMA,fjw5wnq,t3_eyhj3w,1583635722.0,"IMO, I want Jojo to end with Hye-yeong. 

From the beginning, he‚Äôs been very respectful towards her. (Uh let‚Äôs set aside the creepy stalking because Sun Oh did that as well) He respected her boundaries because she was in a relationship with Ik‚Äî can‚Äôt remember his name. He‚Äôs still respectful of her feelings and understands boundaries. He doesn‚Äôt judge her based on trauma. And when he finally confesses, he doesn‚Äôt push for constant validation like Sun Oh with love alarm. Just seems like a more mature and healthy relationship forming. 

I‚Äôm obviously biased. I just can‚Äôt believe Sun Oh really pulled some shady business when he knew Hye-Yeong liked her! He still tried to pursue her, knowing she had a bf as well. But now he‚Äôs trying to play victim like Hye-Yeong is betraying him. This man shows a lot of narcissistic traits. Their high school fling was cute puppy love. Idk his constant need of validation is childish and toxic. On another late, he really can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù her clearly."

careerchange,fh3o5je,t3_f197dq,1581270726.0,"I am also 25 and in a data entry job. I just want you to know that it is definitely a dead end job. It‚Äôs only been a year a 3 months and I cannot take the redundancy any longer. It‚Äôs nice to sit all day, but personally I feel like there is no bigger picture (only bc my job specifically is registering/ logging patient visits/ clinical history and there are no career ladder opportunities). I will say there is a lot of opportunity for transfer and pros of networking. 

But definitely look into your local hospital. There are a lot of office jobs varying in different data entry especially if it‚Äôs research based or just secretarial work. There are so many departments (such as pediatrics, ob gyn, infectious disease, pathology) too. You don‚Äôt have to stop at just that, you could venture into research coordinator roles too, office day shift, workload depends on bringing in patients for research, phone calls, paperwork. It‚Äôs not as customer service as you think or probably just research data entry. If you really don‚Äôt want to talk to people head on, there‚Äôs other positions for that too. Also if the hospital is associated with a university, there is tuition waiver/ reimbursement opportunities if you ever wanted to take classes and such.

depression,fgvdbrc,t3_f0nszx,1581145456.0,"Idk if this is helpful, but ever try sparking up hobbies or things you‚Äôd both like to try? For example, could be something like a one hour session of painting together and just talking about your thoughts and feelings as you get your creative juices flowing with some soft background music. You could honestly introduce her to Pinterest and get lost in that and spark some conversations about her dreams and encourage her to take on small projects if she wants. Or even you. You never knows what you can find. Could be a recipe. Could be some DIY. Could be anything! A 10 minute stroll around the neighborhood, soaking in some sun rays. Not talking extravagant projects or goals here. Just little things. 

It‚Äôs really good, I believe, that you‚Äôre able to notice these signs of aggressions. It‚Äôs not bad to have awful breakdowns. I always tell myself, I look crazy and I feel kinda crazy, but I feel so much better afterwards. It‚Äôs like letting all that negativity out of your system. But it‚Äôs depression right so it just builds up again until you let it out. But now, focus on steps that make you feel good. You‚Äôre taking a semester off to be less miserable. What do you like? This is time for self discovery! Could be a new routine‚Äî something simple like a different cereal a day that starts your day off better because it was so yummy or idk jigsaw puzzles or new look or online gaming if you‚Äôre into that! Did you like what you were majoring in? And definitely don‚Äôt stress about going back if you‚Äôre not ready for it. Trust me. Colleges are willing to take your money any time. So take your time and trust your process :) 

I‚Äôm slightly experiencing the same thing with my mother. She doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy sessions. As she says she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to someone who doesn‚Äôt know her etc. I know she‚Äôs lonely and she enjoys talking to me while I shop with her.
