offmychest,fo5omlq,t3_fx62g9,1587531054.0,"Out of all coworkers, myself and another coworker were chosen to go to off site covid screening labs  to basically table, hand off masks and sanitizer, direct patients to designated areas based on their symptoms and/ or to their car if the lab is full. PPE such as face shield and gloves would be provided to make us “comfortable” and “safe”. 

If we decline, the hospital views it as refusal to work so we would have to quit on the spot and cannot receive unemployment. I just cannot fathom this. It’s ridiculous. I am a glorified data entry lab technician. I’m underpaid already. We were notified by hospital and university that the minimum wage increase would not be taking effect and we would not get hazard pay, simply because the hospital and university did not give it out during the Ebola crisis. Other team members were given opportunities to cross train in other labs and we were told we were supposed to train too, until these specific lab areas notified my supervisor they simply did not want to train us any more. 

What’s so hard about tabling? Any kind of customer or patient service is not an easy job, especially if the patient is already feeling ill. Conversations can get hostile and tense quickly. We are supposed to direct people back to their car if the waiting rooms are full. I can’t imagine not getting yelled at by someone whose questioning whether or not they have covid. I don’t want to get indirectly spat on or whatever happens when they decide to scream at me because I have to tell them they can only have one guest with them and shun away other visitors they’ve brought along for support. How shitty. Not to mention my personal safety and the safety of my parents and younger siblings. 
It’s all fear based. The unknown. 
If my coworker and I lived alone, I could understand posing this risk. But we both, one fresh out of college, I’m still in school, both living at home with immunocompromised people. This is a high risk first contact task they are forcing us to do. It’s not as simple as well you signed up for the healthcare field so this is your job. My job is accessioning. Creating and logging patient hospital accounts and ordering testing. I don’t have any patient contact. I get a sample, I track and receive specimen, I create an account number and log it and give it proper testing codes and send it off to people who know what they’re doing. One mistake, one number/ letter off can get me written up and stay on my record. 
I just don’t see how they can manipulate the situation into well you’re refusing to work so you’re terminated but actually you have to quit and you can’t use your PTO or earned vacation. Btw no hazard pay and no raise, but we pay you as much as someone who works at a fast food joint with benefits and higher risks for patient mistakes will mess your job record up with us, we won’t transfer you to a department that will train you simply bc the trainers don’t want to train, but you are essential so thank you for what you do."
depression,fn49aqf,t1_fn46krs,1586636682.0,"It’s all a learning process. You can always transfer. Don’t forget that. Starting new is scary but refreshing. This time you can go to a college you’d want. 
It’s a big step. You have these qualities that people keep you around because you’re a good friend. But let’s reverse that mindset. Finding friends will come in time but it’s great that you’re recognizing signs of an opportunist."
depression,fn48cag,t3_fzc9ho,1586636123.0,"Hi Op. I think you’ve done a great job writing out everything you could’ve to explain your situation. 
I’ll try my best to answer your questions. 

First thing I would like to say is, college isn’t for everyone. Your parents can continue to blame you for wasting their money, but they decided to give you the opportunity. They made a decision and they can’t blame you for that. You took it and it wasn’t the right fit for you. You already knew that cause it wasn’t your dream school. It sounded like you had to settle a lot.

I want to encourage you to not give up. You won’t be stuck in that shitty hometown. Your dreams aren’t too big and unrealistic. What’s hurting you is your fears. Everyone has them. Being able to write them out for a group of randoms to potentially read is very brave and shows your vulnerability. As for the social anxiety thing, I would suggest baby steps. You should never just push yourself into a situation you’ll be uncomfortable in. For example, college kinda does that. A shit ton of students, professors, etc. everyone is doing their own thing and you already feel like an outsider, you know. I, myself, sometimes find myself in situations during college where I’m comparing myself to other people and then I get reallllly nervous in wanting to approach people and spark up a conversation. People are scary. But baby steps, ya know. You might notice someone with something cute and you comment and then a friendship could start. You never know. There are definitely resources like NAMI, your PCP could recommend some potential free resources (people to take to like psychiatrists or whatever group talk) and your parents won’t know bc HIPAA. Search for online resources too. At the end of they day, it’s just taking a leap of faith. If you waste money, think about it. Waste money and potentially love it or waste money and know that you hate it. Second option seems like it really sucks but you still learned that you hated it. That’s a still a win for me. There’s so many options out there for schooling. You don’t even have to go to school, you can try to search for some local art communities and start from there if you can’t commit to the idea of paying for art school. It might open up new doors for you— real life connections can lead to internships or find some really chill people you connect with. And it doesn’t have to be in person if it’s online! 

I’ve also been in the situation where everyone around you is just sick of dealing with your feelings and listening. If they’re not willing to listen or give you some solid support and advice, then I’m not sure if you want to open up to those people. Sometimes the expectations of telling someone you care about that you’re hurting and expecting them to reply a certain way is unrealistic. I would recommend communicating what makes you feel like this or that and if you did this and that instead, it would make you feel better and they can offer some advice to do this or that. Like a compromise. But if they’re just unwilling to hear you out then i think it’s better to invest some time in people who are more understanding and can relate. 

The relationship with your sister, I’m not sure how else you would able to mend that relationship. I would just suggest a final reach out, state your intentions and feelings and how you want the relationship to go. If she continues to ignore you then just give her space. She might be feeling suffocated. Idk how old she is but if she’s younger, that’s tough. Give her the space and time to come to you. 

Anyway, I believe in you OP. As cliche as this sounds, you can achieve whatever you put your heart into. It won’t be sudden. Being able to leave your hometown will take some time. Make a plan: goals, dreams, etc. Prepare yourself. Grow. Gather some cash. Find some passions. Take a leap of faith. Then when you finally get out of there, it’ll be so worth it. It’ll be so refreshing. Your life is what you make it, honestly. These people can tear you down. They can shit on you, but as long as you fight for what you want and yourself, then you’re invincible. I know this quarantine sucks, but hope you come out stronger than ever.  Hope I helped."
depression,fn45fx5,t3_fzfwlf,1586634431.0,"Wow. I can honestly relate. I felt out of place and judged in the last friend group. I felt like they just spoke to me because of mobility access. 

Just leave this toxic group or voice your concerns. Hope you find people who will make you feel appreciated and love you for you. Just remember, you don’t need them, they need you. Don’t offer to pay or drive anyone around. And most importantly hope you love yourself enough to realize you’re just not the ugly fat friend. I always feel like the uglier and/ or the most plump friend in all my groups, but they constantly reassure me that I’m not. At the end of the day, it’s all about how you see yourself. I see plus size people with raging confidence and somehow they are fearless and their face and aura are glowing. I always wish to have that confidence and wonder if they have those same doubts. Best of luck :)"

depression,fkfdgkz,t1_fk0hgu6,1584131997.0,"Hope you can find some friends that you can mesh well with. One shitty friend shouldn’t rot your experience.

depression,fkfc6r4,t1_fkdax7d,1584131242.0,"Definitely can relate. I’ve experienced multiple friendships that were this one sided. Honestly it’s great that you’ve finally stepped away from it. Doing nice things for other people and including them is a really simple thing to do, especially when you have no ulterior motive. But when is enough, enough? One thank you is enough acknowledgement to start changing directions on this one way street. But again, she couldn’t even do that and that is when knowing your self worth also comes to play. How much meaning do you hold to them? If she doesn’t say anything, good for you. You don’t need that toxicity anyway! Thanks for relating! :)"

KDRAMA,fjw5wnq,t3_eyhj3w,1583635722.0,"IMO, I want Jojo to end with Hye-yeong. 

From the beginning, he’s been very respectful towards her. (Uh let’s set aside the creepy stalking because Sun Oh did that as well) He respected her boundaries because she was in a relationship with Ik— can’t remember his name. He’s still respectful of her feelings and understands boundaries. He doesn’t judge her based on trauma. And when he finally confesses, he doesn’t push for constant validation like Sun Oh with love alarm. Just seems like a more mature and healthy relationship forming. 

I’m obviously biased. I just can’t believe Sun Oh really pulled some shady business when he knew Hye-Yeong liked her! He still tried to pursue her, knowing she had a bf as well. But now he’s trying to play victim like Hye-Yeong is betraying him. This man shows a lot of narcissistic traits. Their high school fling was cute puppy love. Idk his constant need of validation is childish and toxic. On another late, he really can’t “see” her clearly."

careerchange,fh3o5je,t3_f197dq,1581270726.0,"I am also 25 and in a data entry job. I just want you to know that it is definitely a dead end job. It’s only been a year a 3 months and I cannot take the redundancy any longer. It’s nice to sit all day, but personally I feel like there is no bigger picture (only bc my job specifically is registering/ logging patient visits/ clinical history and there are no career ladder opportunities). I will say there is a lot of opportunity for transfer and pros of networking. 

But definitely look into your local hospital. There are a lot of office jobs varying in different data entry especially if it’s research based or just secretarial work. There are so many departments (such as pediatrics, ob gyn, infectious disease, pathology) too. You don’t have to stop at just that, you could venture into research coordinator roles too, office day shift, workload depends on bringing in patients for research, phone calls, paperwork. It’s not as customer service as you think or probably just research data entry. If you really don’t want to talk to people head on, there’s other positions for that too. Also if the hospital is associated with a university, there is tuition waiver/ reimbursement opportunities if you ever wanted to take classes and such. Dunno if that interests you but hope I helped broaden your perspective!"

So technically they’re not qualified to apply to a junior developer job right off the bat. 

Think of it like an extended internship where you’re assigned a mentor to help guide you through things I assume a newly CS grad would already learn or whatever in college. And if they like you, you’re hired. If not, idk lmao that’s what I’m asking"

depression,fgvdbrc,t3_f0nszx,1581145456.0,"Idk if this is helpful, but ever try sparking up hobbies or things you’d both like to try? For example, could be something like a one hour session of painting together and just talking about your thoughts and feelings as you get your creative juices flowing with some soft background music. You could honestly introduce her to Pinterest and get lost in that and spark some conversations about her dreams and encourage her to take on small projects if she wants. Or even you. You never knows what you can find. Could be a recipe. Could be some DIY. Could be anything! A 10 minute stroll around the neighborhood, soaking in some sun rays. Not talking extravagant projects or goals here. Just little things. 

It’s really good, I believe, that you’re able to notice these signs of aggressions. It’s not bad to have awful breakdowns. I always tell myself, I look crazy and I feel kinda crazy, but I feel so much better afterwards. It’s like letting all that negativity out of your system. But it’s depression right so it just builds up again until you let it out. But now, focus on steps that make you feel good. You’re taking a semester off to be less miserable. What do you like? This is time for self discovery! Could be a new routine— something simple like a different cereal a day that starts your day off better because it was so yummy or idk jigsaw puzzles or new look or online gaming if you’re into that! Did you like what you were majoring in? And definitely don’t stress about going back if you’re not ready for it. Trust me. Colleges are willing to take your money any time. So take your time and trust your process :) 

I’m slightly experiencing the same thing with my mother. She doesn’t believe in therapy sessions. As she says she doesn’t want to talk to someone who doesn’t know her etc. I know she’s lonely and she enjoys talking to me while I shop with her. It’s minuscule but I believe it’s helpful for her to relieve some stress. Sorry this comment was so long, but I’m hopeful for you and your mother"
