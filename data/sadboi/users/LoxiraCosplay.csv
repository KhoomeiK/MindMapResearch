On 28th Feb I came down with a really sore throat and a bit of a cough. Developed a fever and my pulse rate was really high and started getting a runny nose. on Sunday still had the same symptoms and the high pulse was worrying me so I rang 111. I didn't have any shortness of breath but they told me to go to A+E. Had a chest x-ray come back clear and blood test said I was fighting infection and I had a white spot on my tonsil so they put it down to a throat infection and gave me antibiotics and sent me home. My dry cough was really bad Monday and Tuesday and I still had all the other symptoms. started feeling better by Friday but felt exhausted, also kept getting chest tightness. 

Still have a bit of a dry cough now and been a month."

I found a pattern for a turtle neck on Etsy that I’ve shortened but with the shorts I’m going to take a pair of my shorts and trace the shape and size as I saw a few people on YouTube do it that way but if that doesn’t work I’ll find a pattern. 

I think simplicity 8444 would be good start for a Sakura cosplay, I’ve got a book called The hero’s Closet that has things like a school uniform and a magical girl dress in and has the patterns too so I recommend that."
