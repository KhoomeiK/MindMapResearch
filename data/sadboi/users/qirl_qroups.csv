Onision,fj4yfav,t3_fa5tdw,1583019898.0,"To me, the idea of Greg only being able to think about vaginas when it comes to women instead of thinking of us as human beings, or people to have a relationship with when these girls message him is disgusting as well.  He believes that we are mere objects meant to fulfill his sexual needs, and that is also the reason why his ""impregnating"" kink has become even more believable.

 I hope that these young and clearly naive girls run away from him as soon as possible and realise what kind of person they were pursuing."

It matters, and it should matter to you the most, seek for your own validation before anyone else's and that will help to strenghten your perspective of yourself and your voice.

Also! I'm so proud of you for trying and staying here, you're undoubtedly very strong and will get through everything eventually, with time and patience. In case no one has told you: it's okay not to be okay, and you're doing amazingly, just for still trying 💖"

thesims,fhx56wr,t3_f538i2,1581944967.0,"I think so too... The Sims 2 & 3 were made in a more loving way almost. There were countless interactions & relationships between families, friends & lovers that were very complex. In that sense I miss the ""Generations"" expansion very much, it was simply beautiful and the interactions between the sims were very meaninggul. Another thing that I adore is that drama could be created very easily, which in my opinion spiced up the game... confessing infidelities was very fun to me, or being know as a ""cheater"" in the neighborhood... And the secret relationships that sims had with one another within the neighborhood, we are missing all of that.

While I expect the Sims 5 to be as estetically beautiful as The Sims 4 are, I hope that EA actually sees that we value these things more than clothes, or new items that we will forget about when the next expansion comes out."
confession,fhiee66,t3_f376fl,1581623115.0,"I applaud you for doing so, in my opinion you did well, no one stood up for you and everyone allowed it, so well done. I went through that as well, 6 years of my life, I was only abused physically the last 3 years. 

Everyone knew, my mother talked to the teachers and the principal countless times, no one lifted a finger. I was mocked during and out of class to the point I started to shake whenever I had to stand up and go to the blackboard or my name was mentioned. 

I wasn't the only one though, there were other cases of bullying that literally everyone knew of but no one ever did anything to prevent or stop it. I've seen kids getting beat up to the point of bleeding in front of teachers while they took a sip of their coffee and stared in awe, no one gave a fuck.

Due to lack of funds, the school was closed, and I personally love that."

insaneparents,fhh1pi5,t3_f2xsi7,1581589641.0,"I don't understand why are these people allowed to have kids, if after their birth they will be mistreated and in a constant risk of contracting diseases that could potentially kill them. There are wonderful people who aren't able to have kids nor adopt because of the immense cost & these people, who clearly do not care about the well-being of theirs are allowed to, and take pride of not doing so. ""Look at my unvaccinated kid!! Look at how vulnerable and sick they are, they are going through something that I could have prevented if I were a responsible parent!! Will that have consequences for them? Probably, but who cares??? I proved that I am right and that is all that matters!""

If you won't take care of your children properly, do not have them, please, thank you."
Onision,fhe7yd7,t3_f2apnr,1581516170.0,"This video was terrible and it gave me a fucking headache. He just excused himself of all of the bullshit he has said over the past few years by basically saying that Twitter is a platform in which people tweet out meaningless things that clearly don't represent us as people, and that after all, by willingly being users of the platform, we are approving of, being ""punished forever"" for saying ""thoughless things."" 

He also said that he was trolling but that he could NEVER do it like years ago because right now it is held against you. And that the reason he left is because he no longer finds pleasure in those things...

This his narrative over and over again and it would be belivable if most of the things he said on Twitter wouldn't have been stated in his videos, in the videos he has made on his ""OnisionSpeaks"" channel for example.

And I also do believe that somehow he is trying to recruit more of his fans, and gaslighting them so that they will join his website in which, clearly, he won't allow anything that could possibly incriminate him or make him look bad."
Onision,fhe2ogt,t1_fhd22r2,1581511861.0,"Something similar happened to me... I was at the age of 14 when I started watching him, and at that time I started self-harming and was very suicidal. I felt sad, guilty, useless, disgusting, and horrible for doing so, I already knew how bad what I was doing was, but I was in an awful place mentally. 

The thing is that I started watching him, and watched the videos in which he dubbed Kai, and their dogs and somehow that made me feel better about everything, not because they were uplifting but because they were distracting and I needed thaf the most. 

However, when I found out about his self-harming videos I was devastated... the person that made me laugh, the one person who distracted me, thought horrible things about people like me, who self-harmed, who only found comfort in physical pain & who would realise later on that it was rather the opposite, but at that time I didn't need anybody to tell me how terrible and useless I was, specially about such a sensitive topic, clearly it wasn't him who needed to tell me those things, but since I thought that I couldn't tell anybody (*PLEASE DO REACH OUT, ASK FOR HELP IF YOU NEED IT*) and I thought of him as someone who had a lot of mental struggles within his life and somehow he seemed very stable I thought that what he was saying was relevant (_it isn't_)

His view changed my entire perspective of myself and I stopped to watch them as a whole. I was suicidal when I did that. Thanks to my dad finding out my scars, I felt incredibly ashamed and stopped doing it after seeing how hurt my parents, who thankfully found out, were. I was sent to a psychologist and I overcame self-harming, today I no longer have suicidal thoughts and if I do they aren't as vivid or frequent. I still struggle with anxiety & I believe that I am depressive though (it isn't because of him, neither was the self-harming, he only made me feel worse but I never self-harmed more severely because of him)

I kept watching him despite that,  and tried to think that he was saying those things to help people somehow and that I was too weak mentally to understand or to confront what he was trying to say. It only lasted for a while. I was disgusted by his ""body rating videos"" and even then I knew how incredibly odd and harmful they were. I stopped watching those because I was too disgusted to do so (*I NEVER supported them*) and then what happened with Billie took place and I realised how incredibly mean and unstable he was and I couldn't stand him since that day.

To conclude, he clearly had absolutely no place in saying those things about SUCH a sensitive and dangerous topic, and I am SO glad that shortly after I realised that too."

Onision,fgiy0y2,t1_fgi0zn4,1580833287.0,"THIS, EXACTLY THIS. That is why he is so abusive to his parterns, for example, he shaved Shiloh's head for his own pleasure, because he wanted to humilliate her, not only during sex, but also in her daily life, he knew that it was because of HIM and loved making her feel powerless as well. That is also the reason why he asked Billie to shave her head, tattoo his name on her ass or to allow him to tie her up in his basement, because he enjoys to control his partners until they no longer hold any sort of power over their very own being. And Sarah, sadly was so naive at that young age that she let him have control, but ended up getting pleasure, which wasn't in his plans, so he has decided to catalogue that experience as ""disgusting.""

 Onision might believe that he has such a complicated mindset, since he thinks very highly of himself, but this kind of behaviour is that of an emotional abuser and the reason why it might have taken us a bit to fully understand his thought process (to a certain degree, because now we have all of the pieces of the puzzle with all of the information that has been recently released) is because some of us had never imagined that he was this way, that he truly enjoys hurting people, humiliating them to get pleasure from their pain, that he is an emotional abuser that lures his victims only to degrade them to a point in which they are no longer themselves. It's terrible."

Onision,fgfjcwn,t3_ey7cag,1580740333.0,"One of the worst aspects of this case is that he is truly trying to sexually shame Sarah for having sex with him after HE, and his husband Kai, were the ones to officially become Sarah's guardians and take advantage of her in the first place. They wanted to have sex with her and have ADMITTED to it, both of them, but after seeing how incredibly wrong this is, have decided that none of that happened, and have stated that somehow an 18 year old girl could coax TWO GROWN adults into having sex with her.

And also, he is now accusing her of doing cocaine (it's her life, she can do whatever she pleases) as if grooming her, housing her for so long only to have sex with her after she had freshly turned 18,  only to reveal private and intimate information about her, and then abandon her wasn't worse. 

He ALWAYS does this to his exes, they are always lying whores, who took advantage of him, who cheated of him, and who have mental illnesses that make them have an erratic and uncontrolled behaviour. It's yet another pattern. I only hope that people, his underage fans realise this, and that he can be prevented from hurting other young girls that clearly have a lot less experience when it comes to life in general."
science,fgfiavp,t1_fgfe21a,1580739517.0,"In my case I'm still studying. Every single night before the day of an exam I dream that something from the theory is left to study and I make up new concepts in my dreams, and I start ""memorising"" it in hopes to be able to study everything that is left. Then I wake up thinking that I can't remember what I had studied until I realise that it was only a dream."
niceguys,fgf7lvr,t1_fge58fm,1580728732.0,"Yes, slightly before he got arrested for DUI, he became Bizzle. It was a nickname, probly given by his friends, such as Weezy for Lil Wayne or Breezy for Chris Brown. During that time he wrote ""Journals"" since he had just broken up with Selena, started to release collaborations with artists/rappers such as Tyga, and had started being around models such as Kendall Jenner or Chantel Jeffries.

 Afterwards he started to travel back and forth with them (there are countless of pictures in which he is seen with around 4 or 5 models, and everyone knew that they were together) & started taking drugs to the point his staff had to check if he was still alive hourly in case he had overdosed (he confessed this  in an interview in an interview he had to confirm his engagement with Hailey) drinking every day, and it is believed that during this time he became a nymphomaniac. 

The last statement is relevant because, even if he and Selena had broken up, they were clearly on and off, and he had been cheating on her for a while with said models, and probably other women.

After he recovered, Justin and her started dating again (after a few years, maybe 2 or 3) and then, two months into the breakup, and after all she forgave and everything they had been through, he got engaged to Hailey and is now married. 

 That is the reason Selena declared that she suffered emotional abuse during their relationship."
