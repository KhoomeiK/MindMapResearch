BioshockInfinite,fi03ce4,t1_fi038a6,1582024614.0,"I really recomend you to play at least the first game before venturing into the DLC, because it spoils a major plot point of Bioshock 1.
Whereas the main game of Infinite ties a bit with previous games in the end, the DLC just dive deep down into these connections, assuming you know the main lore of Rapture(the city of Bioshock 1 and 2) and Columbia."
BioshockInfinite,fi0372w,t3_f5pvqf,1582024423.0,"The DLC is amazing, but you need to play at least Bioshock 1 before. 
First part is very similar to the main game, but the world/exploration is just incredible.
The second part however try a new type of gameplay, and it is really well done and refreshing. The story is also amazing and the ending is even on another level.

10/10 must play"

depression,er9n6qf,t3_c0y7d5,1560626284.0,"Around your age, many guys are ""stupid"" (in social term), if they find you ugly, they would tell it out loud. If someone is not mocking you for your look, it means it doesn't matter to him (or at least it doesn't bother him too much and your personality is well compensating for him).

If it can make you feel better, I have been in love (more like hardcore limerence) with someone who has been mocked for her look around your age. Even if it didn't turned well, we're still friends up to this day. Even if you don't think so, I am sure there is at least one person who doesn't think shit about you. If you can find him/her, try to befriend him/her. It really helps to have a solid social base in order to search for love.

Sorry for the bad English, I really hope you will find someone you can trust. Think also that with time, men (and women too) get more mature, and accept flaws easier. You're still young, things can still change for the better."

Something has been found: there has been mention of a ""secret society"" (I think) in this game, called ""Left Eye of Horus"".

It is also an anagram of ""Free The Soul of Y"".
I personally highly doubt there is any corellation other than juste an easter egg, but one can hope  it would be set on the same universe as ZE.

Apologies if this has been debunked since, I don't follow all the stuff going around Somnium Files too."

depression,ep49ry6,t3_btvqv2,1559036155.0,"First of all: you're NOT a piece of shit, you're just frustrated and that's totally normal. Frustration shows that you want to get rid of this shitty situation, that you still have even just a little bit of hope.

And for the ""normie advice"" rant, I like to think that even if the majority of these people don't really care, there are some of them that actually care, they really want to help you. But they don't know what to do. Think about it: they are in front of someone with severe depression, and they want to cheer him up. What would you do in their place? Maybe they fail at some social interactions, just like us. Maybe we could give them the opportunity to help us further. Maybe engage the dialog, ask them if they really think what they say, maybe just ask them for some compliments or motivation. Or just ask them to chat, even if this is awkward, if you trust them enough.
If you have close friends or family you think who would be willing to help you, try to give them the opportunity. What could go worse?

Anyway, sorry for the bad english. I tried to reconfort you, but there is a chance that this will be a complete fail and that it will be useless. But if you still need to rant to someone, I am here. Best of hope."

Fargo. It's basically Breaking Bad's camera and realisation mixed with the sense of humor of the Coen brothers. Each season is a new story, and each one is sufficiently original to stand on it's own.

Anime:

Definitely Steins;Gate. Less known than the big titles of the genre, but definitely unique. It's a sci-fi story involving time travel. Except that this is the most accurate depiction of time travel I have ever seen, with the less plotholes. The first half can be boring but as the characters grow in you, the second part is really good, and the feels train never stop until the end."

ForeverAlone,eoak6h0,t3_br6qhq,1558420051.0,"Have you considered playing solo video games?

If yes, I recommend you the Dark Souls series, just because it teach you how to deal with failures.

Everyone sucks during the first hours of Dark Souls. It is hard and rough, but I think everyone who is able to finish games like Zelda is able to overcome Dark Souls.
Each time you die, you learn something new. You evolve to adapt yoursemf to this game. And the satisfaction after beating some parts is totally worth the deaths encountered on the ways.

And there is the JOLLY COOPERATION that can help you through the game, as well as forging some good memories on the way.

Anyway dude sucking at Fortnite is totally normal and average, and even 1-2 kills per game is good. You can still try something new, others types of game. Try to find a game you enjoy, even if it is not challenging. Shaming bad players is really the worst and most toxic part of every multiplayer game's community."
