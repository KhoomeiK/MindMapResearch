Three listens in and I think I like Punch more than Kick It.

I'm not a fan of the shouting/chanting on top of it, but I *really* love the smooth vocals and the breathy raps in other parts. It seems like a mix of Fire Truck and Limitless to me, the latter being my favorite title track from them.

NonStop seems to be the most praised from what I've seen, and rightfully so. It sounds like it could be the title track, and I'm certain they'll perform it alogside Punch on music shows too.

Make Your Day sounds really nothing special imo, but it's still a nice addition."

NCT *is* unique but constant lineup changes with little to no clarification and certainty works less in their favor imo. Their concepts look good on paper but the execution is just... well, let's just say it could be better.

I remember every single pull and trade I've had, and there have been a lot.

I'm a bit of a completionist (although I limit what I collect) but I don't really pressure myself and only really immediately buy when I come across a good deal - plus I know which items to prioritize. I love the research, strategy, and organization that comes with collecting. I'd say my favorite part is when I'm finally storing and displaying the albums/dvds/etc. and cards.

I also made a Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6nweR3Ru9hZFW5fAroFqQy?si=uMyxhg5dSuSTPNMUmygkjw) of songs produced/written/arranged by the MonoTree team, if you want to hear more of the songs they've worked on.

MoDaoZuShi,fgs30b6,t3_ezlpl5,1581068947.0,"This is exactly the order I plan on going with the franchise (I'm currently halfway through the novel).

Reasons (sorry for the format):

1. CQL (50 ep ver.) - Start with something that is in visual form to familiarize yourself with the characters, story, and setting. It's easier to read the novel if you have a clear image of how certain characters, objects, and places look, especially if you are not familiar with the wuxia/xanxia genre or \[Ancient\] Chinese culture in general. You could also start with the donghua or manhua since they're also visual but I wanted to start with the drama because it is complete plot-wise.
2. Novel - Immediately head to the source material to get a deeper and better understanding of the characters + other details. I believe the novel and the drama complement each other well; although there is some plot divergence, imo it isn't too huge of a difference and it's really fun to see the ways in which they differ.
3. Donghua
4. Manhua
5. Audio Drama - Tbh I think these 3 are interchangeable and it's up to personal preference. I prefer reading comics in general but would like something audiovisual after reading more than 100 chapters from the novel so I go with donghua (audiovisual) > manhua (visual) > audio drama (audio).
6. CQL (special ver.) - I just think this would be a nice treat especially if you end up favoring the drama adaptation and want to rewatch with fewer eps but with a few neat extras added.

LOONA,ffzgsgq,t3_ew2snl,1580378340.0,"I feared that they would go this route soundwise, but after seeing the teasers and hearing the snippets from the videos I had a little hope that I'd be wrong... guess I was right after all. They all look great though, albeit a little tired."
kpop,ff10wd0,t3_eqx8q8,1579474132.0,"I feel bad as an orbit because this tracklist is not doing it for me at all lol. Of course, I'm still excited for the comeback! I hope the song previews can change my mind somehow."

bangtan,fdne6c9,t3_emarh6,1578583890.0,I love how the beat darkens and his flow changes at the end when he takes on the voice of the 'shadow.'
bangtan,fdndrwy,t3_emarh6,1578583645.0,"That was intense!!!! Now... judging from the trajectory of the comeback trailers for this era, it seems that we're getting Hobi for Ego, with a possible sample of the 2 Cool 4 Skool intro. I had mistakenly thought that Shadow would sample one of HYYH era's intros (with Ego having a Boy Meets Evil sample), but it turns out they're going the opposite direction. And I'm here, and I'm all for it."

billieeilish,fajhh6k,t3_e9k9rp,1576137945.0,"Aww this post makes me soft. And actually, I do. I have a younger brother and he is absolutely everything to me. In fact, a large reason why I feel so attached to Billie and her music is because of her relationship with her brother; it really reminds me of my brother and I."

kpop,f6vtypc,t3_ds1ybr,1573200516.0,"NCT's title tracks are usually non-romance tracks, my favorites being The 7th Sense and Limitless, both which talk about the fine line between dream and reality."
unpopularkpopopinions,f6np23l,t1_f6nm67r,1572996548.0,"To my knowledge that only applies when you're an already established singer/soloist and/or the song is part of a drama OST. Loona is a rookie idol group so it would be risky for them to release and promote a ballad album/track on its own. Not to say that BBC haven't been risk takers, but at this point in the project I think they can't really afford such big gambles."

actuallesbians,f6kv86n,t3_drod68,1572921538.0,This is why I simply look for scene compilation videos on YT. They take the entire queer storyline and post the cut online so noone has to go through any of the boring parts.
LOONA,f629p7p,t1_f626355,1572655518.0,"It's obviously our fault for not getting them any wins for their debut and comeback. /s

People like directing their anger to specific entities, and unfortunately with how openly dramatic and petty he's being with the whole situation (although understandable), he's getting the brunt of it. BBC is staying quiet and they're still the entity that's currently working with Loona so people give them more of a pass."
LOONA,f62982n,t1_f626fpg,1572655298.0,"But all of Loona's songs are listenable even without knowing the lore attached to them. They aren't like movies or shows with strict linear narratives; they can stand on their own. I doubt any casual listener would care about 'gatekeeping,' they'll just listen to what they like."
LOONA,f6278za,t1_f626w0g,1572654433.0,Yeah it's because he's still not over them and ooo is like that rebound for him.
tipofmytongue,f62543b,t1_f62469n,1572653515.0,Solved! Thank you so much. I can't believe I forgot that MV when I actually listen to and like the song.
tipofmytongue,f5zouom,t3_dpzglj,1572582482.0,I am not sure what genre or decade this song is in
kpop,f5vs4f2,t3_dp4mgm,1572497951.0,"I absolutely each and every group/unit from the NCT brand and adore all of the members but I think WayV has to be my favorite, and also one of the most special since I got to witness their debut. I was so happy while watching this that I screamed along with the crowd even if I was watching through a screen lol."
kpop,f5vrox4,t1_f5uj1aa,1572497501.0,I honestly think (probably more like hope) SM will end up making ot6/5 Dream into a fixed unit.
tipofmytongue,f5vpvmp,t3_dpih32,1572495752.0,P.S. Not sure about the decade or genre of the song.
