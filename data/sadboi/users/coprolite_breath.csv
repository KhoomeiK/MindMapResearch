Codependency,fo8lnvx,t3_g69lfc,1587598993.0,"While I did not watch your video, as I am drilling down and focusing on my own mess (as a codependent who had C-PTSD from long term narc abuse),  I can offer you some encouragement based on my experiences.

If you are going to put your stuff out in public,  you need to grow a thick skin.  Plenty of toxic people out there,  full of negativity.  They are mostly insecure with themselves so lashing out or making fun of someone else makes them feel better in their small world.  That never goes away; no shortage of assholes on this planet.  But once you can accept that and learn to not take things personally,  it gets a lot easier.  Realize that there is very little you can control in this world.  Only you and the way you react to things.

I was fortunate enough to find a support group for narc abuse survivors.  I have no problem putting my deepest feelings and secrets out to this group,  but I know and trust them.  Have moved past the ""victim"" stage and have entered into a period of self discovery.  It was not  that long ago that I accepted my codependency,  and now can see how it contributed to my abuse.  Taking responsibility for it and making the changes that need to be made.  Setting boundaries.  Letting go of the past.  Re-parenting myself,  which is not an easy thing to undertake at my age.  But I am willing to put the work into it.

So,  don't worry and give zero fucks about what other people think about you or what you put out there.  Work on making a better you and finding your own happiness.  There is so much bullshit that gets in the way of true happiness.  Explore your spirituality,  find what works for you.  The path is not easy but you can do it."

NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fkbqxfa,t3_fhju95,1584038155.0,"When I got divorced,  I didn't know what a narcissist,  let alone a covert, was.  I thought she still cared about me as human being and as the father of our children.  Boy, was I wrong.

Had I known then what I figured out afterwards, I would have done things differently.  I knew money was the most important thing to her,  but I didn't know the degree she would go to get it. The kids were important,  not because she loves them.  She sees them as her property,  an extension of herself.  

She stepped up the abuse to distract me from the fact that she was hiding money with her mother.  This messed me up to point where I signed whatever was put in front of me.  She made out like a bandit but I won because I escaped with my life.

You have to figure out what your nex wants.   Money?  Power over you with custody, if you have kids?  Or maybe just the power trip of the divorce and him feeling like he is winning.  Also depends on where you live and the divorce laws.  Some things may already be decided by the court,  like retirement splitting.  

You also need to figure out what you want and what you can part with.   Your best bet may be to just cut your losses.  Be wary of anything he wants that can keep you attached (barring kids).  Lawyers could turn it into a drawn out money bleed.  My ""amicable"" divorce cost me $10,000 in lawyer fees.  But sometimes they are a necessary evil.  If the narc's demands become too outlandish,  the mediator may not work.  Not sure if that would be reported in court.  Where I lived mediation was mandatory before a judge would hear a case.

I finally got trauma therapy and it made a world of difference.  I went from multiple nightmares a night to hardly any.  And the ones I get now are more symbolic.

One theory about dreams is that they are your brain's way of cleaning out garbage.  Unresolved trauma and traumatic memories  are thought to be stored scattered throughout the brain,  not with your other memories.  Processing the unresolved trauma can clean out the garbage that you don't need.  Consider trauma therapy if time does not heal it.  You can use the bad experience to become a better person."

I would still be doing CBT/ talk therapy and  making little progress had I not done the research and made the choice to get the right therapy for me.

I remember telling one therapist ""I get what you are saying,  it all makes perfect logical sense within these four walls.  But as soon as I walk out the door,  all bets are off.""  With unresolved complex trauma,  your amygdala is calling all the shots.  Some people can learn to moderate their behavior and unhealthy coping skills.  Others will need to process the trauma or it will keep  coming back.   The trauma therapist I eventually found  has little experience in the the type of trauma I went through (adult emotional abuse).  But she applied the  trauma therapy techniques she was versed in and it worked.  Also, a support group for people who went through the same trauma has been great.  Getting validated was unreal.

Yeah,  wild mood swings that were heavy on rage.  But also hypomania.  Have to admit I miss that a little.   A couple years on different mood stabilizers did nothing.  

Turns out I was never bipolar.  Once I got the correct diagnosis and finally into trauma therapy,  the symptoms largely went away.  In hindsight,  my abuser went to most of the intake appointments during the years I was with her and seeking help. She either spoke for me or wrote down what I was to say.  Thank you trauma bonding.  Her ultimate solution to do away with me was for me to get heavily medicated and go on disabilty.

Is the professional you are seeing trauma aware?  In my experience,  most of the therapists and doctors I went to were not. Not even on their radar.  There common symptoms between bipolar and C-PTSD.  But a mental health professional not versed in the effects of complex trauma is not going to see it."

Alpha protocol  is straight neurofeedback.  Playing a game that rewards you when your brain produces the desired brain waves.  I noticed effects after the first few sessions as my brain relearned how to produce the alpha waves.  It was  a month or so before I started to feel much calmer,  but I been pretty strung out courtesy of C-PTSD.  Three years of sleeping no more than 4 hours a night.

LENS stands for low energy neural stimulation.  It is a microcurrent being applied to the brain via the scalp or to the spine.   Having had some concussions  in the past, this is supposed to help with that brain damage.  My understanding is that  going through the spine is supposed to help with trauma stored in the body."

It worked very well for me and allowed me to do EMDR to process the traumas.  I don't think I would have been able to do it without the neurofeedback first.

Pretty expensive but worth every penny as my last ditch attempt to get some control back on my life.  In the US,  insurance probably won't cover it.

Make sure you interview the provider carefully.  How much experience they have dealing with C-PTSD....  I was fortunate enough to get it through a trauma therapist.

I trusted her completely and even after the divorce thought she was being fair and honest.  That was 100% bullshit.  She destroyed the last 3 years of our joint account statements because she was taking cash out and hiding it with her mother.  She turned up the abuse level as well so that when the divorce happened I would be too crazy to care and would sign whatever was put in front of me.  It worked probably better than she could have hoped.

This is not sour grapes either.  I just figured it all out after the divorce, after I got help and the fog of C-PTSD started to lift.   Honestly,  I don't care about the theft of money (yes, it is stealing) anymore.  I would pay it all and more just to be a whole person again.  It was hard to come to terms with the fact that she chose to torture me to hide it. Hindsight is 20-20.  The only time she ever cried real tears during our 17 years together was when she had to give me half of our savings account, months after we seperated.  She could not come up with a way to keep it all and it hurt her more than anything else.

Have you consulted a lawyer yet?   Do not believe anything he says or expect him to do the right and honest thing.  More importantly,  do not let him know that you are aware of what he has been doing.  Play it cool and naive until you get yourself into a safe position."

Sorry you went through this.  Some people who are survivors of emotional and psychological abuse develop C-PTSD.  What you listed are all symptoms of that.  Remember,  no one here can diagnose anyone else,  leave that to the professionals.

It is strongly not recommended to go to couples counseling with a narcissist.  They will only use it to find more of your vulnerabilities and use them against you.  If your spouse is a narcissist,  they will not change.  I could not tell from your post but the assumption is that you are getting out of this realtionship,  and that ""dropping the D word"" was just not stir up some action?

I wasted a long time on the wrong types of therapy before things started to get better.  First,  my Nex had convinced me I was bipolar while we were still married and I spent a few years seeking help for that.  Counseling and drugs with horrible side effects.  Shortly before the divorce she suggested I just quit work and go on disabilty for the rest of my life.  Fortunately,  I did not and eventually quit seeking treatment for BP,  as deep down I knew it was not that.  Before the divorce was final,  things got really bad and I tried to end my life.  Then I got correctly diagnosed as PTSD (they still don't recognize Complex in the US mental health care establishment.  

After things got much worse,  I found trauma therapy and things started to get better.  Trauma therapy allows you to process the unresolved traumatic memories and feelings.  Those are what keep you in the loop of unregulated emotions and all the other fun byproducts of emotional abuse.  

I now attend a support group for survivors of narc abuse that meets every other week.  It is one of the few places where I can be myself and people understand me because they have been through it to.  Still attend therapy as well.

So,  long answer short:  it depends on the type of therapy (as well as the therapist) along with a  lot of other things.  Everyone heals at a different rate.  And depending on how damaged a person is,  you have to rebuild yourself or build a new you afterwards.   Some people just need time.  Others,  time and therapy to process the trauma.  And others will need to keep working on themselves for long time.  And healing is not linear.

Forgiveness is not something you have to give.  Your abuser needs to ask for it.  Even then you don't have to give it.  A lot of people who have been through trauma and have healed become better people for their experience.  That is what I am shooting for.  Feel free to ask me for any clarifications or details about what I went through."

Consider trauma therapy if you are not healing in the way you think you should.  I didn't get it until after the divorce.  Not sure if it would have helped getting it sooner.  I was so lost and had no idea what a narcissist or NPD was.  And did not hit rock bottom until later.

The betrayal of your emotions followed by the realization that your whole relationship was a lie is hard pill to swallow.  But that also helps you to not take it personally.

Mine also claimed I was an unfit parent in a bid to keep me from taking a portion of her retirement savings,  per the law in our state.  Her attorney shut that down pretty quick.  

Don't torture yourself over it like I did.  At the time I was pretty deep in C-PTSD and had tried to end my life.  I used to look up the court records and stew over it.  I got so worked up in my head that, at the actual divorce hearing (which was just a rubber stamp process as we hashed it out before then through our lawyers),  I convinced myself that I would be arrested at the trial and never see my kids again.

A lot of mental health professionals don't understand adult emotional/psychological abuse.  Especially when it is slow, subtle, hidden abuse.  Just because you don't have scars on your skin does not mean your abuse was any less than someone else's.  Honestly,  unless you have been through this kind of abuse  yourself,  you really can't wrap your head around it.  How many people on this and the related subs have said that none of their friends or family believed them or asked them ""why didn't you leave sooner?""?   Or knew the abuser and refused to believe they could do that to someone?

My trauma therapist is wonderful, but by her own admission, she has little experience with adult emotional abuse.  However, she never invalidated me and was able to read how fucked up I was from it after the first few sessions.   I shared a few articles that explained it better than I could.  She was still able to help me process the unresolved trauma and emotions, then begin the healing process.  The methods are generally similar for all types of abuse.

Sorry you are going through this.  I got divorced from my narc in 2017 and it took several months after that to realise what she was and how much damage she did  to me.  She stepped up the abuse the last few years to distract me from the money she was squirreling away.   I trusted her with everything, even after the divorce.  It culminated with me trying to end my life but I messed that up to.  Since then, I got into trauma therapy and things have gotten way better.  

So, after the fog lifts some and you can start to grasp what was done to you,  you accept it and begin the healing process.  You can't change the past and if your abuser is still in your head than they still are manipulating you.

Do not blame yourself.  You did nothing wrong and you did not deserve any of the abuse.  You were manipulated over a long time and that is almost impossible to see until you pass the tipping point.  

Are there any friends or family that you can reach out to for support?  They won't  really understand the abuse unless they have been through it themselves,  but they can help you in other ways.

It takes time but as you make small changes and do new things, you get back your confidence.  Look at it this way:  the old you was destroyed but you get to build a new you.  Who you want to be and not the person the abuse made you into.  It will get better and you can use your awful experience to become a better person than you were before.

Mine ex cheated and refused to end the relationships.  We had small kids at home and it kind of broke me to discover that she had a while secret seperate identity and life.  Full time jobs and 2 young children was not exciting  enough and she was no longer the center of attention.

At first she rubbed it in my face but as time went on she got better about hiding  it because of how much tension and drama it created.  I was obsessed with looking for one more detail about the past or checking to see if she still was cheating.  Eventually I stopped counting and caring.  She would however do things to mess with me like leave another man's shirt in my dresser for me to find,  then try to say it was her father's.  I didnt know it at the time but it was a well thought out plan to destroy me as a person.  Worked pretty well too.

In her mind (and as she had said many times to my face) ""Rules don't apply to me"".   When I first found out about her other life,  I discovered that through ads on Craigslist and other websites,  she had gone on at least a dozen lunch dates with strangers to decide if they would be suitable for a BDSM relationship.  In her mind this was not cheating.  I tried to reframe the scenario.  ""What if your father came home from work and told your mother "" I had lunch today with a women I met through my online ad.  It was to decide if I wanted to enter a violent sexual relationship with her"".  All she would say is ""that is different"".   

If someone is deleting emails,  that says that they have something to hide or there is a serious problem in the relationship where there is a lack of trust and communication.  Privacy is one thing but secrets are another.  I imagine that cheaters  in ""normal"" relationships experience guilt or regret to some degree but not a narcissist.

I wasted several years getting therapy and taking drugs for something that she convinced me I was sick with.  I went 3 years of sleeping about 4 hours a night unless I was drunk or medicated.  Her ultimate solution, during divorce/discard  was for me to get heavily medicated and go on disabilty.  And we have children.

There are 2 kinds of empathy: cognitive and emotional.  Cognitive empathy is being able to see things from another person's perspective, to be able to walk in their shoes.

CPTSD,fdjp2rh,t3_eljaf6,1578481702.0,"After reading a lot about this subject  I have to agree that unless you have been through emotional and/or psychological abuse yourself,  it is hard to grasp just how damaging it can be.  People  have no clue.

My abuse was emotional/psychological and during adulthood.  It was also hidden (covert),  so I had no idea I was being abused until well after I became a madman.  It didn't help that my abuser convinced me that I was bipolar and I sought treatment for that for a few years.   By chance I learned about C-PTSD,  and it became more clear that I had that and not Biploar (was diagnosed PTSD by a psychiatrist).  This in itself was hugely validating.  

Going back to how I was abused,  it is hard to prove.  There were no gross examples of abuse,  more like a million little abuses that added up to one huge abuse.  If you were to meet my abuser you would have a hard time believing that they are capable of the things they did.  That everything about thier personality is a lie,  because their emotional development shut down at an early age.  

Not all that long ago, I veered off the path of trying to get any type of justice or revenge (and any validation that might come from that).  I didn't want revenge per se,  just acknowledgment that this person abused me.   I go to a support group for people who have been through the same abuse.  The leader keeps reinforcing  the mantra ""it does not matter why they did this to you or to what degree they realized they were abusive.  Focus on fixing your brain"".

The best revenge on your abuser is to live well.  What I am now focusing on is  becoming a better human.  Better than I was before the abuse.  Trying to help people out of the same pit of craziness and despair that I was in for a long time,  or even just help someone less fortunate than me.  Realizing what is important in life.   I don't  care if no one believes me about what I went through. I know it is true.  I am going to turn it around into something positive.

If you are struggling to validate what happened to you,  you have to realize that you will probably never get closure (validation) from the people who abused you.  Searching for that will just hold you back from healing.  I did a ritual closure and burned some stuff-just papers like my marriage license, as well as a whole lot of stuff I had written down.  

You can't  change the past and you have little control over everything else in this world except for who you are and how you react.  

I hope I don't come off sounding like an asshole for what have written.  I struggled with the validation puzzle for a long time.  Then realized that I need to be only in the present and not worry about the past or the future.  I get it that not everyone is there.  We all heal in our own way.  Just trying to point out what held me back from healing."

CPTSD,fd05x5e,t3_ejopg8,1578114105.0,"I am sorry you went through this.  I did EMDR, though my trauma was from extensive emotional abuse during adulthood.  It was covert or hidden abuse, so there were some memories,  but a lot of it was just feelings (a million little abuses that slowly wore me away until I was someone I did not recognize).  My C-PTSD was pretty bad, lucky to have survived it.  I ruminated constantly on the abuse and that led me to uncontrollable rages.

EMDR did not make me forget the memories.  They are still there but they no longer hold me hostage.  I don't ruminate much anymore and go days without thinking of my abuser.  It can be a long journey to recovery.

From my understanding, normal memories are stored in a neat, organized fashion, grouped together.  Unresolved traumatic memories are fragmented and scattered about the brain, which is why you trigger and ruminate (and the body holds on to it as well, read ""The Body Keeps the Score"").   Because your brain could not make sense of the trauma at the time, it remained unprocessed.  EMDR allows both hemispheres of the brain to experience the memory and you become desensitized to it.  

In a typical session you will relive the event in your mind while engaging in an activity that activates both sides of the brain.  A hand waved like a metronome that you watch.  Or alternately blinking lights or buzzers in each hand.  You repeat the process until your physical response is diminished.  It is physically  challenging.  And you will get an emotional hangover afterwards.  You can also do positive EMDR and focus on a good thing to reinforce them. It does help some people, but not everyone.  There are other trauma therapies that work.  Brainspotting is kind of new but I have heard good things about it.  And DBT has been proven to work.

After EMDR you have to continue working on yourself.  The trauma wipes so much of you  away or prevents you from having ever been you.   But it is like once the trauma is lifted, you get a chance to build a new you that is not defined by your past trauma.

Look into it more and give it a try.  I wish you peace and healing."

The path to recovery for survivors of psychological abuse is different for everyone.  While I am still on the journey,  I can say I have made huge strides.  I was married to a covert narcissist for 17 years and developed pretty bad C-PTSD from her abuse.  After discard,  my emotions were uncontrollable (a lot of rage) and I attempted to end my life once and came close a few other times.  I finally got into the right kind of therapy.  

While it can be hard to process the trauma from hidden abuse,  it can be done.  After 1.5 years of therapy,  I hardly ever think about her anymore.  We do have children,  though they are older, so at first I communicated with her.  I made the decison to go NC after I realized there was no limit to what she would do to ruin my life.  This has resulted in my being somewhat alienated from my kids.  She planned for this to happen, as she views our children as an extension of herself or her property.  I communicate with them some and see them a little.  My goal is to heal and be there for them when they finally realize what their mother is.  

After extreme psychological and emotional abuse,  you can't really go back to the old you.  You have to create a new you.  With this you are given the chance to become the person you want to be,  not the person the abuse made you into.   I would say the big changes for me are a  greater appreciation for the important things in life and a lot more empathy/compassion for others.  Still a lot of work to do on some parts,  but I now think I am a better person for the experience I went through.

So it can get a lot better.  And you will always be a better person than your abuser.   It will be some work.  Look into trauma therapy if things aren't progressing along as you think the should.  Keep NC.  Invest in yourself."

Sometimes you can tell right away that the fit is not right.

I have been to maybe 10-12 different therapists/psychiatrists in my life.  Most of that was a waste of time because the person abusing me was going with me or telling me what to say at intake and had me convinced that I had a different mental health issue,  not C-PTSD.

It took a long time to figure it out,  as victims of emotional abuse are often gaslighted into believing they are the problem.  It was not until I figured out and was diagnosed with C-PTSD that I was finally able to get into trauma therapy and work through the unresolved traumas.  More specifically,  the person who abused me called the police over angry (but never threatening) text messages I has sent,  when I was starting to figure out what I had been through.

So yes,  I own the rage, the shame, the craziness and the self medicating but it was not narcissisism.  I got the help I needed to start the path to recovery.  Everyone has some narcissistic traits,  it is self preservation.  But that does not make them abusive.  A true narcissist /NPD almost never sees their behavior as abusive or destructive.  They have a  different logic and reality from what the rest of the world lives in.  It is generally agreed that people who have a Cluster B personality disorder suffered some form of abuse or neglect in childhood (along with a genetic predisposition).  They put up strong walls to protect what is left of the child,  and as a result,  stop emotional development.    It is not something you develop as an adult."

Learn what Gray Rock communication is and go with that.  He is still looking to get an emotional rise out of you because that is what he feeds on.  As long as you are still emotionally vulnerable to he him,  he is still manipulating you.   You only need to communicate the facts/logistics of the kids.  Don't let him in your house.  He has no reason to come in.  When you are feeling secure/stable enough,  go for the child support.    Yeah,  it may make sense to lay off now if you can,  if it will keep him from being volatile.  But ultimately you need that money for your kids.

Your local domestic abuse agency may be  able to provide some help and legal support.   If you understand how a narcissist thinks, what their motivations are,  it makes it easier to deal with them.  Ultimately,  you may have to give on some things in order to get the peace you want.  My ex owes me over 6 figures in retirement savings.  Currently about 16 months No Contact.  Our kids are older but the youngest is not yet 18.  I knew money was really important to her but underestimated what she would do when I asked for it.  Let's just say I feel lucky to be alive.  She can keep it.  I have peace that she never will find.

So you need to do your part which is not give him a way to get at you.  Eventually   he will get bored when he is not getting the reaction he wants from you.  But don't let him bully you  out of what is legally and rightfully yours (and your kids).  It will get easier over time.

You are trying to do the right thing but remember your STBX is not.  If he is a narcissist and you are getting divorced,  he has already  discarded you and he is only thinking about the property and financial aspects,  as to how they most benefit him.

It comes down to deciding if you want to pay your lawyer $350/hour to argue over  household items.  See if there is another way you can convince your STBX that he is getting the better deal.  He may not want a pink bedspread but will take it if he thinks he is on the one up.

Is it worth giving him more household property if it speeds up the divorce?  Are there other  things of value you can take on lieu of household items.

mentalhealth,fc55sgl,t3_eg4dk2,1577444656.0,"I felt very invalidated by CBT because it did nothing to address the underlying trauma.

I recall telling one "" I understand what you are saying and it makes perfect logical sense, but once I leave this office,  all bets are off b.

NarcissisticAbuse,fc52vrp,t1_fc4uprb,1577440301.0,"Expanding on what ImYes said about it being rooted in childhood.  It comes from a trauma or neglect that causes the child to put up strong walls as self preservation.  Unfortunately,  this causes emotional development to stop.  So they may have some emotional capacity (it is a spectrum disorder)  but the higher level emotions like empathy are just not there.  They may understand adult emotions and be able to mimic what they lack to some degree,  but it is not the same thing as having real emotions.

The human brain is an amazing thing with the capacity to rebound and restructure itself to heal from a lot of things,  but this is not one of them.   The developmental milestones were missed so they came up with another way to survive that works for them.  It is not like being able to learn to ride bike as an adult because you never had one as a kid, which might be difficult but certainly possible.   It is way more complex than that."

I am sorry, the truth hurts but the sooner you accept it,  the sooner you can move on.

Go  gray rock  and don't give him anything more than the logistics of seeing his kids if he wants to.  Don't give him the emotional reaction he is seeking from you.  Talk to a lawyer.

therapy,fbew0fw,t1_fbem8ld,1576795273.0," If you you are in the US,  you might be looking at therapists who accept your health insurance.  While most of the therapists who do accept insurance  are perfectly capable,  they may just belong to a group practice because they are less experienced or they do not want to run their own business.  Some of these worked in large practices where the goal was to see the maximum number of people a day, in the shortest amount of time.  I have seen a few individual therapists who did not accept insurance as they could get enough business without having to deal with the reduced pay and hassle of insurance paperwork.  There was a noticeable difference between these therapists and the ones who worked in large group practices.

In my case,  I was misdiagnosed a number of years back as the result of being in a mentally abusive relationship.  My partner convinced me I was Biploar and in hindsight,  she either went to all the intake sessions with me and spoke for me or she told me  what to  tell them.  So  I was going after the wrong thing and not a sngle one picked up on the abuse.  In their defense, it was subtle (covert) and over a long period of time.

The one who was behind the times was very old school and kept trying different drugs that had horrible side effects.  He did not pull out ink blots and have me identify what I saw,  but I would not have been surprised if he had.

Ultimately,  it was up to me to figure out that I was not bipolar but C-PTSD.  I sought out a trauma therapist and things got a lot better.

So,  it depends a lot on what you are seeking treatment for.  If it is trauma based (and you may not know)  a trauma informed therapist is the way to go. You may have to try a few before you find one that fits you.  Good luck and wish you the best."
therapy,fbel0ks,t3_ecyt87,1576788044.0,Experience has a lot to do with it.  Someone with more years of treating people can generally charge more.

If  I were just trying to figure stuff I would go cheaper first.  But that has just my experience in the dozen or so different therapists and psychiatrists I have been to see.  One that charged a lot was really behind the times.

NPD,fb6wrwd,t3_ebmam1,1576563309.0,"Hi,  I want to commend you for taking action on , and going public with, your journey to healing your narcissism.  Even though I am fairly exhausted, being at the end of a long day,  I read through your blog and it came across pretty clearly as being written by someone who understands what their problem is and that they are sailing into largely uncharted waters in order to  heal themselves.  This is no small feat.

First , I must point out that I am a victim of NPD abuse and almost lost my life because of it.  Part of my own healing is to work with others who are victims of emotional abuse.  To help them as they figure out their own path to recovery.  On my journey I  have tried to learn as much as I could about NPD.  Why did they develop this way? The underlying causes.  Can they change and ""fit in"" with the rest of society?

You are absolutely correct in saying that there is very little information to be found about how one may heal from NPD or even where they might begin to make changes in order to do so.  And I don't need to remind anyone here that there is not a lot of love (or understanding) out there for NPDs,  especially from those who have been abused by one.  These are mostly people who have been deeply wounded and are lashing out at what they see directly in front of them.  I try to make sure that the people I help understand that NPD is a disorder,  brought on by childhood trauma (with some genetic help).  They did not choose to develop NPD; they are victims themselves.  It is the ultimate self defense mechanism,  with some very unfortunate side effects.  So, I just want you to know that some non NPD people do understand |that.

I like the approach you are taking with using citations and references to actual studies and published papers.  So much of what is put out there as help for victims of  emotional abuse is just click-bait, drippy, feel good crap that does not offer any real useful information about moving past the abuse and living life again.

Wish you the best in your healing and will continue to read your blog.  It was < interesting and enlightening so far.  Thanks."

Things will be very different now that you have broken it off.  There may be a narcissistic injury.  Do not expect her to adhere to any verbal agreements or ""do what is best for your kid"".   All bets are off.  Do not trust this person at all.

Ideally hash out as much as you can before hand but please have a divorce attorney who is experienced in narcissist divorces go over everything with you .  You will have to settle all custody and visitation arrangements before the divorce is final and have it all in writing.  And expect to  go back to Family Court in the future.  Either you will get dragged in on something made up or you will go to try and enforce the custody/visitation agreement.  I am coming from the experience of being divorced by a covert narc after 17 years.  At the time I had really bad C-PTSD from her abuse  and had no clue about Cluster B disorders or narcissists.  Never on my radar.  I trusted her to be the person I thought I married.  But that person never existed.  It was all lies and manipulation.  I figured it all out well after the divorce when I was in trauma therapy.

I can't say I ever had anything going on quite that extreme,  my bad thoughts were all directed internally  and I did try to end my own life.  I did suffer from uncontrollable emotions,  especially blind rages,  but never threatened anyone nor was a threat to anyone other than myself.   It was Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,  as a result of long term emotional abuse during adulthood.

Trauma therapy helped me immensely.  I worked through  and processed the unresolved traumas,  which allowed my brain to calm down and relearn how to  be a person.  If you suffered childhood abuse,  there is a good chance you have plenty of unresolved trauma floating around in your brain,  contributing to negative thought patterns and whole host of other problems.

No one can say for sure what any one therapist would do in terms of reporting you and having you hospitalized.  It depends on if they see you as a danger to to others or yourself.  A lot of that can  depend on how you present yourself.  First impressions do count for something.  I am not suggesting being anything but completely honest with a therapist,  but if the first words out of your mouth are ""cannibal"",  flags will probably be raised.

I would look into trauma therapy,  a therapist experienced in childhood abuse and trauma.

I am sorry for the abuse you went through and what it has done to you.  Everyone deserves a normal, nurturing childhood.  You can't get that now,  but you can take steps to heal yourself with some professional help."
NarcissisticSpouses,fb5egzt,t3_ebaik5,1576526122.0,"Regardless of whether he is a narcissist  or not,  the realtionship sounds abusive and you need to end it as soon as it is safe and manageable to do so.

When someone misses developmental miletones as they are growing up, they can't go back and try again.  The brain develops in a different way to compensate.  A narcissist generally won't be self aware,  though some are.  And most experts would agree there is not any effective treatment for narcissism and NPD.

  Because it is on a spectrum,  those on lower end may be able, through therapy, to learn to recognize their destructive behaviors and control them to some degree.  But that is very few.  Most see no problem with the way they are.  Everyone else has the problem.  Many make it through life as ""sucessful"" people,  without ever realizing how much they are missing from the human experience."
mentalhealth,fb3ypwh,t1_fb3vdcq,1576496242.0,"TW:  Suicide. 

Don't underestimate/undervalue the potential damage from emotional abuse.   When I was finally divorced after a long marriage,  I was convinced I was the bad person, that I (well she convinced me) was bipolar and that it was all my fault.  She was fine,  dating already (not including the cheating during our marriage) and I was spiraling out of control.  Ruminating constantly.  Hypervigilant,  but had been been that way for a long time because of of all the cheating. Out if control emotions.  Not in a good place at all.  Eventually I figured out C-PTSD,  and after more of my anger (we have kids) and police involvement,  I found the right kind of help.  It was not until I was months into trauma therapy that I realized what she was and how much damage she did.

In the big picture, labels don't mean shit.  You have identified that it was a toxic realtionship and it sounds abusive.  You can't  change the past,  you can't do a thing about former partner.  You can only control you.  I don't suggest trying to self diagnose.  Leave it to a professsional.  Just keep an open mind,  especially when it comes to healing yourself.  What you describe sounds like unresolved trauma,  which can fade away but if it is bad enough,  trauma therapy can really help with.  I went  for three years of sleeping 4 hours a night I wired so tight.    In  such a better place now.  I had tried to end my life at one point because I was so messed up and did not understand how or why.  Life has so much to offer.  I am working on being a better human being for the experience I went through.

Emotional abuse can cause you to lose trust in your own brain.  Cognitive dissonance  from having two widely opposing ideas in your head.  ""she loves me but she keeps cheating"".   Your brain cannot make heads or tails and you hand over control to your abuser then become trauma bound.  Intermittent reinforcement  is very addictive.  Your brain gets addicted to the dopamine reward you get when your abuser randomly does something positive for you after being mostly negative.  Your brain is chasing after that high that comes without rhyme or reason.  It is not something you can control.

I am just saying,  look into your feelings and state of mind some more and  decide how you can make yourself  whole again and if you need help.  Some people just need time.  Wish you peace and healing."
