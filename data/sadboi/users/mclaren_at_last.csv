So now it's extra shaggy and gross. I'm about to have my roommate cut it for me. Hopefully it doesn't turn out too horribly. I really hate my hair being this long lol
HPfanfiction,flsaly4,t3_fqlxcv,1585437909.0,RemindMe! 1 week
butchlesbians,flsag6g,t3_fqutz4,1585437810.0,"My family was SUPER against the idea. They loved my long hair and would get sad whenever I talked about cutting it short. They would come up with a million and one reasons why I shouldn't. Finally I just... Chopped it off myself without telling anyone. Once it was all cleaned up it looked awesome, and my confidence grew leaps and bounds. My family wasn't happy with it initially, but they have come to admit that my short hair fits me very well. They still have hopes of me growing it out, but they now know that they don't really have a say in that either"

Start with the chores/areas that will either make the most VISIBLE difference, or that will make you breathe the biggest sigh of relief. And then work your way down the list. 

As for day to day, declutter as much as possible. And then for what's left I've found that the more organisational tools/tricks I use, the more likely I am going to be able to keep it clean. Or at least cleaner üòÖ"

For me though, I only notice them the first couple of hours after I take it. Then they go away, or are so slight I really have to focus to notice them. When I get my dosage changed I will notice them all day for about a week. I'm sorry you are dealing with them still since stopping the meds. Maybe see if a dr can give you answers, I wish I had some for you. Sending hugs"

Many of the witches and wizards seem to think that muggles can't touch them in the first place. Muggleborns (especially once born after WW2) and half-bloods that keep in touch with the muggle world know what destruction muggles can bring about, but everyone else has no idea, and isn't likely to believe these muggle-raised people after sitting through the outdated muggle studies class. Sooo... How can they put up protections against something that they don't even know exists? The explosion, there may be a chance, but how can they block out radiation if they don't know the first thing about it? And the muggleborns and half-bloods only have the knowledge of a middle-schooler, so unless they went to do a bunch of research in their free time, they honestly don't know much more than the wizarding raised people either."

thesca,fcy6w7r,t1_fcy54cx,1578075667.0,"I had maybe 42 hours listed for volunteering my first year, and that was just me helping out at my school's greenhouse for a few hours each week. I was doing it for extra credit, but I listed it anyway. It won't be the end of the world to not have any hours volunteering, just make sure the rest of your application talks you up. They understand that not everyone is able to commit to volunteering somewhere with real life involved, especially as a college student. And also, another (future) note: any unpaid internship, especially those by the SCA or AmeriCorps, can be counted as volunteering hours. 

If you ever want help with your application, have more questions, or even just another eye to look it over feel free to DM me and I would be more than happy to help out!"
thesca,fcdrdyb,t3_egwf5r,1577612821.0,"I started out my freshman year of college with no experience outside of girl scouts and my family's camping and backpacking trips. Since then I have done three internships with the SCA. You sound like a shoe-in for an interview at the very least, but I'm sure you will get something if you apply. 

The biggest advice I can give is to apply for all twenty that you can. And then monitor them. Make sure the position hasn't been filled or cancelled. If it has been a month and you haven't heard anything. See if there is something more/equally interesting to apply to. 

Update your application again. Even if it's just fixing spelling/grammar mistakes; this will resubmit your application to be looked through each time you update it. 

If your application gets sent off, send them an email personally introducing yourself and giving a short blurb about how you are interested in the position and a thank you for being interested in your application. Add your resume with references in the email too. 

Save the positions you are cycling through if you end up doing that, so you can find them again. Look at the ""hot positions"". Apply to everything under the sun if it interests you. Don't pay attention to the ""fit rating"". My last position had my fit rating at 20% and I still got it. 

Look through the position descriptions and pick out key words and skills and see how you can incorporate them into your application. Get as many references as possible. My personal minimum is 5. 

Click as many of those skills off as possible. 
GIS/GPS: daily use of map apps. Eagle tracking project in high school. Mapping data in geology class.
Working with animals: Personal pets. Helping out at my grandmother's farm. 
Chainsaw Experience: Can clean and maintain a chainsaw, experienced in swamping for a Sawyer.
Data Entry: Call Centre job. 
Money Handling: Girl Scout Cookie Sales. Retail job. 
Bird Identification: Familiar with commonly known and urban birds. 
Etc. 

Same with education. Whether it's a degree, a class, volunteering, personal interest, previous job, etc. If something gave you some level of experience in it, click the appropriate level of education and elaborate. The skills and education is largely what makes up the fit rating. And you are more likely to get your application sent to a partner. 

I wish you good luck and happy hunting! The SCA is the best thing I have ever decided to do. You've got this!"

I huff, grunt, hum, make a sound halfway between a huff and a cough, and ""click"" (in the back of my throat, so it sounds very similar to my huffing).

Since my PTSD was compounded during an abusive relationship last year, I now feel like I'm having to relearn everything from the bigger words I used to use daily, to how to hold a conversation, to how to do things I felt like I could do in my sleep (ie. Talk to a dr, write emails, make jokes, etc). It seems like 80% of my day is me staring blankly at things as I try to remember how to function or interact with the world around me. I feel like I should be able to do certain things that I can't do. It's like my brain says 'oh, we've done this 1000x' and my body looks at my brain and says 'you are speaking a foreign language that I've never even heard of before'"
