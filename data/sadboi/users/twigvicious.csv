TalesFromTheFrontDesk,folh6tu,t3_g7vxfc,1587862148.0,"One time at my job I was telling a story about playing Cards Against Humanity with parents and other family on Christmas and how I had to explain to them what bukakke was and how CAH was now banned from family gatherings. As I was laughing, I noticed the blank stares from my manager and another coworker, and I realized with horror that I was going to have to explain to them what bukakke was as well. That...was not my best day."

horror,fhcxagh,t3_f295as,1581472796.0,"The first thing that came to mind was Penpal by Dathan Auerbach. It’s not overt horror, but for me it was genuinely unnerving and had me on edge the entire time. And another one that isn’t an obvious choice is I’m Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid. This is another that’s not really obvious horror, but there’s so much tension, like you know something bad is about to happen and you’re just waiting for it, the tension growing as the book goes on."

BPD,ffvoqm6,t3_ev5upy,1580269161.0,"Man, I feel this. Just today I had a particularly rough day, and I was thinking how hard it is to explain how this feels. It’s like how a young child gets frustrated because you don’t understand what they’re trying to say because they simply don’t have the vocabulary to adequately convey it. That’s how I felt today trying to talk to someone about it."

Paranormal,f61srac,t1_f61sle6,1572646120.0,"Yeah, you would think that would be like a prime haunting place. Maybe it’s because people don’t usually actually die in the morgue - they’re already dead when they get there. Or maybe they were just quiet ghosts."

The one where you saw them pulling their SUV up the driveway sounds like they thought no one was home because you didn’t get the door right away, and they were going to rob the place. A similar thing happened to me recently. If you live in a wealthy area, that might make your house more of a target because they’re more likely to find items of value."

fuckeatingdisorders,ey5nwsq,t3_cu7h8k,1566836226.0,"Thanks for your words. I’m a million times better than I was, at least physically. I’m actually at a healthy weight. But my relationship with food is atrocious. For me, it’s all mental right now. I feel as though I’m in a constant struggle, and after dealing with this for nearly 14 years, I’m exhausted. I check out those resources you mentioned for sure. 

Yeah, I remember wrestlers in high school starving themselves to make weight and no one thinking much of it, but it’s so unhealthy, and I think it has the potential to warp their ways of thinking and get them into a lasting, distorted mindset when it comes to body image and the like. And yeah, it sucks that eating disorders in men are often not taken seriously or recognized and viewed as a weakness. I know for a fact more men would come forward with their struggles otherwise."

After talking to the police, they seemed to agree with my assessment and said they have heard of that kind of thing happening.  My aunt called the security company she is hiring, and they're coming on the day she returns from her trip rather than Thursday after Labor Day, which was the original plan.  Also before I left she had me turn all the lights in the house on."
creepyencounters,exz6rf3,t1_exyk8bb,1566661735.0,Thank you.  I don't think this guy intended to harm me - I'm almost certain he thought the house was empty when I didn't come to the door right away.  But who knows what would have happened if he'd actually come in and encountered me inside.

LetsNotMeet,exfz74s,t3_csh5hq,1566251768.0,"I was in a very similar situation. I used to work in a small grocery store and had a lot of regular customers, and there was one guy who used to always stand in my line. I was nice to him and everything, and apparently he took that to mean I was flirting with him. It’s a long story (I’ve posted about it on here before), but essentially he began stalking me - and it all started because I was nice to him. People are such creeps. Sorry you had to go through this, and I’m glad it’s over, but I totally get the feeling of not being really, truly safe anymore."
Thetruthishere,ex4h1vr,t3_cr4f8c,1566004683.0,"Something like this happened to me once several years ago. One of my best friends in high school and I had become estranged for various reasons that now seem so silly, and we didn’t talk for awhile. Eventually we reconnected on Facebook and had begun talking, but it wasn’t the same, and weirdly I missed her more during that time than I did when we weren’t talking. I always felt like I had let her down when she really needed me (she had reached out to me awhile before reconnecting, but I was still so angry that I wasn’t receptive), and on this particular day I was thinking about that and everything I missed about our friendship. I even looked through our old yearbook because - since we were both on the yearbook staff - there were a lot of pictures of us. I really wanted to message her that day and try to really talk, like not just superficial conversation; I wanted to try and get back what we had lost. But I didn’t. I told myself it was stupid because it would be coming out of nowhere, and I thought I’d have more time to ease back into our friendship. 

Later that night, I saw on Facebook that she had been murdered that day. So I get it. I wish I would listened to what I was trying to tell myself that day. I think about that a lot."
