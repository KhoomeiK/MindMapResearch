I was told I could have only 1 4 roll pack and when I tried to explain ( in my nursing scrubs) I was told that my patients can damned well come in and get it themselves. I called a manager and was told to go elsewhere. I was floored. I bought the 1 pack and they each household got 1 roll.

It infuriates me to no end when I see Karen pull up in her Escalade with her 2 or 3 teenagers and not one god damned fucking mask ( or active brain cell for that matter) between them. Mom shops and the teenagers just hang around near the entrance clearly in everybody‚Äôs way.  Recently I had to make the decision that I absolutely will no longer shop at a certain grocery chain as they do not have a 1 cart/ 1 shopper rule and the employees were not made to wear mask or gloves. Meanwhile all the aisles are clogged up with shoppers mulling about in addition to every aisle occupied by unmasked employees stocking shelves. The employees are all younger so I imagine the believe they are all  invincible.

This is an entry level nursing job required to get into nursing school, that aside it pays more than minimum wage and because of the pandemic right now, a new graduate can basically just show up anywhere and probably get hired on the spot. After you save up some cash from the grocery gig take a 6 week (? Depends on the state) course ( online probably the only option right now) and you can work anywhere and get as many hours as you want. Everyone is hiring them right now. In most states you can get a grant( $ you never need to pay back) from the government to become a CNA ( classes, books, scrubs) that you can apply for from your local employment office. The job of CNA is not for everybody. It‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs a steady gig with basically unlimited hours right now( and always will be). It‚Äôll get you some money until and a solid roof over your head and food on your table until you can get back in your feet and figure out your next steps. I hope this helps you OP.
