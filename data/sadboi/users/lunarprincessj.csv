I was wondering; I normally pick up a SIM card at the airport right after coming out of customs but they probably wouldn't let me do that right? 

Also are you allowed to ask for stuff during the quarantine? I watched a video in which someone asked for things like milk during her quarantine at a hotel and they actually brought it to her."

SBU,fkpw799,t3_fjzfbh,1584421273.0,It depends on what school you are in. CEAS requires you to rematriculate the following semester. CAS and other schools will give you 3 semesters before you need to rematriculate but that means you can enroll for classes next sem without any issues.

SuicideBereavement,fg7yfar,t3_excfic,1580604688.0,"Hi, I'm a college student currently dealing with depression and anxiety, and I have been for over 10 years now. Suicide is something that crosses my mind every day. I hope me being on this sub doesn't offend anyone.


When students like me, or young adults in general seek professional help, a lot of the time we still hide the severity of our feelings because we know that if we say we're suicidal and considering suicide we will just be taken to the hospital or put in a psychiatric ward or something of the sort. I personally know that suicide is not the answer. But I can't help but think about it or imagine it and I don't want to suddenly be taken away because it would only make me feel like I'm a psycho or something. So, I end up censoring a lot of how I really feel. When I was in high school, so before I turned 18, I told my school nurse that I would rather die than go to class. She called my parents and said I can't come back without going to the ER and getting a proper examination and medical records saying I'm not a threat to myself. I understand where it comes from but since I was underage my parents had to take me and they blew the fuck up at me after. It was a scarring experience.

You did nothing wrong, it is not your fault. I just wish there were better methods."

depression,f9dnpce,t1_f9dn3fo,1575235177.0,I'm actually receiving them but just for attendance and assignment extensions. I think exams usually can't be extended unless you have a learning disability or something. I always feel bad asking for assignment extensions even though it's my right and the professors have to comply by law. My biggest issue is I have to study for this exam but there's so much material I barely learned because I keep missing class.

depressionregimens,f8a0vz2,t1_f89rhf2,1574384745.0,I agree with the abilify as well. My psychiatrist prescribed it to me in order to help me sleep so it probably has a bit of a sedating effect.

depression,f5n5kve,t3_do8eih,1572296830.0,"It's totally normal. I believe my depression was triggered by my strict and emotionally abusive parents but other than that they were able to provide for me really well and I've never had to worry about money or being homeless after I graduate or something. Depression makes you feel extremely sad, apathetic, suicidal, etc., but it's not because there's something wrong going on in your life. It's literally a hormonal imbalance in the brain or an issue with neurotransmitters (I'm not a doctor or anything but yeah). 

It can also be brought on due to genetics and other environmental factors, and just from one's personality as well. For example I was always more sensitive and a perfectionist since a child and that has brought me to look down at myself a lot if I wasn't good at something. 

I've thought about suicide so many times, I still think about what it would be like if I was dead, even after years of therapy and several different medications. Climbing the mountain is MUCH harder than falling down it. I hope you keep this saying in mind because it helps me a lot. I know it may feel like there's nothing to live for, or there's no purpose, and I definitely have felt/feel the same way, but we're here for a reason and thinking about the purpose of life or the far future is too much for us to handle. My therapist tells me ""if you think too much about the past you'll get depressed, but if you think too much about the future you'll get anxious."" Stay in the present. Right now I'm living while looking forward to a vacation I'm taking next year where I can meet my friends in a different country who are so much nicer to me than my friends here at home. I hope you can find something to look forward to, no matter how small it is. It's better to live for something small than to die for no reason at all."
