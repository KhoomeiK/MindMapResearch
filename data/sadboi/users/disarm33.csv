It's like no one is aware of the fact that for later abortions the heart is stopped days before the actual D and E procedure so there is no live dismemberment. Also for the rare later abortions that are too far along for a D and E, an abortion is basically an induced stillbirth with no forceps or dismemberment. There is so much mysticism around abortions and what the actual process is. After I had my later abortion, I kept hearing all these stories and descriptions of what they supposedly do and it is so misleading. Often times it is just flat out wrong. It makes me so mad. Sometimes I just want to put my story out there with all the medical details so I can do my part to dispell all this misinformation."

babyloss,fp9qlun,t3_gb9xp8,1588432474.0,"I had to TFMR my third and very loved child at 27 weeks after we found multiple anomalies at 25 weeks. Like you, we had low risk NIPT and my anatomy scan was supposedly normal (I honestly think my doctor was asleep during the scan). We did a repeat scan at 25 weeks because he couldn't get a good view of her heart. Anyway, it turned out she had abnormalities with her heart, brain, face, and limbs. We didn't know what the condition was at the time or what her quality of life would be like but there was no way she would live a ""normal"" life. I couldn't risk her suffering, and I couldn't risk my family's wellbeing as I already had 2 living children at the time. Once I knew there was brain involvement, I pretty much knew what my decision would be.

After the procedure we were able to view and say goodbye to our daughter and without getting too detailed, I will just say we made the right decision. I was able to do some research based on her appearance and symptoms and we confirmed the diagnosis with genetic testing. She had a very rare disorder with only 22 known cases. There isn't much known about it . While it isn't necessarily terminal, most children die in infancy or early childhood. Those that do survive are profoundly intellectually and physically disabled.

Finding out so late makes the decision so much harder. Every week seems to count and I am so sorry you are going through this. I would say the impact on my living children and spouse was what helped guide me through my decision. I also didn't want my daughter to suffer. As for coping, it was hard. I was lucky to find an amazing therapist who specializes in TFMR. I also found support online in the r/ttcafterloss and r/pregnancyafterloss. If you do decide to end the pregnancy, I also highly recommend the Ending a Wanted Pregnancy Facebook group. It is private but their website has information on how to join. Having to TFMR is such a lonely feeling, especially when it is so late, but meeting other people who have gone through it has been one of the things that has helped me through this experience.

I go pregnant on my third cycle after the TFMR, my second cycle of trying. My doctor had me on the pill for one month after my TFMR to get my cycle back on track. It was a successful and, despite my horrible anxiety, ""easy"" pregnancy like my first two.  My beautiful son is now 9 months old."

Abortiondebate,fljzgvi,t1_flhdwst,1585230578.0,"In regards to the people you know who have been told their baby would be unhealthy but they turned out fine, what was that based on? I have had an abortion for medical reasons and I am also fairly active in many groups for others who have done the same. I really haven't met anyone who has ended a pregnancy without confirmation of a genetic disorder or physical evidence on an ultrasound.

Usually it goes something like this: A patient gets a screening test (triple screen, NT scan, NIPT, etc) result that shows an increased risk for a chromosomal disorder. Some people stop there and carry to term and take the chance of having a baby with a chromosomal disorder. Other times the patient then goes on to get a diagnostic test (CVS or amniocentesis) that confirms that there is a chromosomal disorder or not. It is then they decide what to do.

Or, the patient has their 20 week anatomy scan that shows an abnormality in the heart. They are then refered to a specialist for a level 2 ultrasound or a fetal echocardiogram to get a closer look. Sometimes it's nothing, sometimes it's something that can be fixed with surgery, and sometimes sadly it is something that is incompatible with life.

Obviously I have more experience with people who have decided to end their pregnancy and all this is anecdotal, but I have never met anyone who was just told that their baby would be unhealthy and decided to abort based on that. I have never met anyone who aborted based on a screening result without either glaring physical problems on an ultrasound or confirmation from a diagnostic test. Often times people feel rushed to make a decision based on state restrictions on how late you can get an abortion."

I was 25 weeks pregnant with my sweet daughter when we found out something was wrong. I had just had a chemical pregnancy the month I conceived her and I was so scared and was so careful. For 25 weeks I was so happy and thinking everything was fine. My NIPT come back low risk for everything but my doctor skipped my NT scan so we didn't get to see her until 20 weeks. At 20 weeks my doctor said everything looked good but we couldn't get a good view of her heart. We also couldn't see her face but he said it was ok and I trusted him. I went back at 25 weeks and he checked her heart again, said it was fine, but then said he couldn't find her nasal bone and that I should see MFM ""sometime in the next couple of weeks."" I knew I needed to be seen that day. Long story short, MFM found a lot wrong with my sweet girl including her face, heart, and brain. We decided to end the pregnancy so she would never have to suffer. We didn't know exactly what was wrong but that she had some sort of genetic syndrome. The amnio and microarray came back normal. After seeing her I was able to do some research and we tested get for some single gene disorders. Turns out a C got switched to a T in one of her genes. One single molecule in all her DNA did that to her and it was completely random and unfair. It has been a year and a half and I love her so much still and think of her every day.

I also had an abortion on my third pregnancy at 27 weeks (so just a week before the third trimester) due to medical reasons. So I am going to have to disagree with you about the third trimester abortions being never medically necessary. There are some serious brain disorders that are not detectable until later in the pregnancy, such as lissencephaly. There are also cases like mine, where something that should have been seen earlier on was somehow missed until later in the pregnancy. Regardless of the reason, later abortions are not easy to get.

Rainbow_Babies,fdsev9g,t3_emu7k4,1578701118.0,"I do too. I thought I was losing my mind. I have 3 living children, including my six month old rainbow baby. I do not want any more babies. I do not want to be pregnant again and deal with all the anxiety of pregnancy after loss. But I still get jealous. I did when I was pregnant too.

 I think I am actually jealous of the idea of someone being happily pregnant without anxiety. I try to tell myself that I don't know the circumstances of someone's pregnancy. I have no idea what she went through to get pregnant or what emotions she is dealing with, etc.

Sorry to see so many of us have these feelings but it's nice to know it's not just me."

AskReddit,fdqkrzu,t1_fdnp6ii,1578669048.0,"Well yeah, people are going to get defensive because there is this expectation that women just bounce back and be ready for sex just like before when reality can be much different. We're told to wait six weeks after pushing a little human out of our privates or getting our abdomines cut open and then we're supposed to be good to go. Some women sustain injuries which may take longer to heal. We are sleep deprived and we have a little helpless baby that needs constant attention. Our bodies may have changed and that can bring body image issues which aren't so good for sex drive. I am sure there are other factors I have left out.

On top of that some people's significant others may not be so understanding and that can add to bitterness on both sides. Plus there is a bit of a societal expectation that women always be ready for sex otherwise we're frigid old hags. Look at all the ""wife bad"" jokes about married couples never having sex. You're not supposed to take the wife's side in those jokes.

Some women may be ready for sex right away and that's cool. But some are not and it can be difficult and you think something is wrong with you. And I can also get the frustration on the dad's side too. Sex is an important part of a relationship. Communication and respect on both sides is important but not everyone gets that. So yeah, people might be defensive. Angrily so if needed."

I hate this so much. And I say this as a stay at home mom of 3. God forbid a woman be more than just a baby making machine. God forbid a woman want to focus on her career. God forbid a woman doesn't want to have kids. What's even stupider is the actress their making fun of actually has a kid and is pregnant.

I always have terrible morning sickness for the entire pregnancy and it's really hard to be in the mood when you are always about to puke. Hormones during breastfeeding can also reduce sex drive and I also feel ""touched out."" After I finally get the baby to nap and get some time to myself I just want to be left alone and go to sleep. My husband and I still have sex and when I finally get going I enjoy it, but it takes a while.

That said, everything goes back to normal after my kids are weaned. I am currently breastfeeding my last baby and I look forward to having my body back to myself and being into sex again. I am sure my poor husband feels the same."

So the later abortions done around the time frame you mention (30 weeks) are generally done via labor induction with an injection to stop the heart. I actually had one of these abortions due to fetal abormalities at 27 weeks and the doctor did mention that there was less of a chance of hemorrhage after fetal demise because the blood flow to the fetus stops. It is also easier to push out a fetus/baby that is deceased around that time frame because it is smaller and has no muscle tone. I have also had 3 live births and I can say pushing during the abortion was physically easier. Not sure if easier translates to safer here."
