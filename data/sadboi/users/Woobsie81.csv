 I wear it while inactive for at least 30 min (like watching tv or working on the computer) or sleeping.   Even wearing it for half an hour before you get out of bed in the morning provides some good relief.

Due to this, my income was still under $1000 a month so I applied for CERB for march and april.  However my sick time runs out towards the end of may and then i would just be on an unpaid leave of absence so I assume I'd have to head back to work part time to continue being allowed to receive the CERB (along as I make under $1000 which I usually do because I only work 10 hours a week there).

WeightLossAdvice,fpmdzxh,t3_gdwmj6,1588731008.0,"I like the idea of a ratio.  So when I was in the best shape of my life I was counting calories and working our 2 hours a day 6 days a week.  I had time only for gym and work and food planning/prep and sleep really.   That was  okay but not a lot of fun.   So like on a scale of health vs instant gratification/fun it was like 95% of the time I was focused on health and weight goals and 5% of the time I enjoyed life and had fun.   That wasnt sustainable for me.  I feel like I regressed to way unbalanced the other way but that to move to somewhere around a 60/40 split to a 75/25 split range is where I'd be happier. Like 75% of my daily choices support weight loss (or maintenance depending on where I'm at) and the other 25% maybe is just for the heck of it...to have fun,to enjoy life etc..   when I became obsessed with calories or weight, that ratio was a bit off for me.  I dont want to feel guilty my entire day for skipping my run or eating dessert a couple times a week out with friends or at an event.   But I don't want to miss out on life by having weight become a barrier to life . I'd like to buy clothes at a regular sized clothing store, but not have to say no to social events because it will ""set me back"" in diet or exercise.   I think getting real with the idea that some work WILL be involved with most people (because we all like to think we are the only ones struggling and all the skinny people eat whatever they want whenever, not entirely true at all!)     are also required to put some moderate effort in to have sustained gains (whether its blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol,BMI, a personal best, or to fit into a certain size)."

Literally yesterday he had a brilliant idea of the lotteries donating money towards hospitals to help fight covid.  He had 0 idea that lotteries in Ontario are literally set up to also donate to charities and hospitals..2 billion a year.   Like,the guy is 40.  What a moron.  He will randomly post that he will be alone forever, or that he is frustrated in being single.  That maybe he should just pay someone to get off.  He is so bloody idiotic.  Unsurprisingly he is single and lives in his moms basement.   And I keep him on there to spy this idiotic posts and bc I slightly feel sorry for him"
