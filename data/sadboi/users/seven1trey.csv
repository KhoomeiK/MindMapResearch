Quick p.s., I do think I was guilty of listening to only what seemed ""cool"". I thought I had great taste (and I still do believe that) but I think what I probably was, was an insufferable twat who looked down on music I wasn't already listening to.

Thank you for this thought provoking post!"
LetsTalkMusic,fpe0zfa,t3_gcw4ew,1588538195.0,"I am 46, and still absolutely love music I was listening to 20 or even 30 years ago. Not all of it as in retrospect I can tell you I had some really great taste interlaced with some real crap, but a large portion of what I loved then I love now.

That being said, I have sought out and found lots and lots of stuff I wasn't previously listening to and have folded it into my personal library. 

I have found that I really enjoy some of the stuff on the radio these days where for the longest time I wouldn't even listen to the radio much if at all. Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Billy Eilish, even the Bieber kid all make music that I like to listen to these days.

As far as off the beaten path stuff, there is so much out there that I would not have thought would be appealing to me. Death Grips in particular is something that I would have never thought would appeal to me but it absolutely does. Same with Deafheaven.

Often it isn't ""new"" but ""new to me"" and I fall in love with it. I have been a punk rock fan for about as long as I can remember now, and like a dumb ass I ignored so many other great genres and artists. Not because I thought they lacked merit, just that I was happily stuck in a rut. These days I absolutely love doom/stoner metal, Americana (Todd Snider, Robbie Fulks, McMurtry), whatever label you want to put on bands like Lucero, Drive By Truckers, American Aquarium, and Trampled by Turtles. I love rap music, especially stuff from Houston but all of it really.

I'm notorious for finding bands late, or even after they are gone, but that doesn't stop me from searching. I remember reading liner notes from CD's and cassettes to see if the bands I loved had any bands they loved, and finding new music that way. Sometimes they fall in my lap, the way Songs:Ohia did (through a friend) or sometimes I stumble onto a band I love on YouTube like I did with Off With Their Heads. 

Really, there aren't too many things I like better than finding new music to love. I still dearly love the music from way back, but I have never let that stop me from trying to find more to love and to share."

Not for nothing but I love ""Home Field Advantage"". Love to hear Shonna sing."
SuicideWatch,fcpfny2,t3_eieayu,1577861904.0,"Honestly, yeah. I'd likely have done it a while back were it not for the people I'd be leaving behind. I don't really feel worthless and I don't have it bad, I just don't really want to BE. Frankly never having been born in the first place would be optimal. Wouldn't hurt anyone that way."

I cant use quote marks as it is from memory, but when Suttree threatens to knock someone's dick into their watchpocket, I knew had a phrase thatch would be using the rest of my life."
texas,fcdvdx6,t3_eh0uin,1577614239.0,"Beautiful shot. One of my favorite places in the world. My in laws had a place right on Copano Bay and we used to be there all the time. Father in law passed and mother in law held on to it as long as she could but wound up selling. I still miss that place terribly and can't wait to get back down there. 

Full disclosure though, I always enjoyed the sunsets more than the sunrises."

cormacmccarthy,fcck6gm,t3_eh1rs0,1577599332.0,"This entire book is just fantastic. As of now I have only read it once, and it took a while to get through at that. I'm ready to tackle it again but it has to go in line behind other McCarthy's that I have but haven't read yet (Outer Dark, Orchard Keeper, and the Border Trilogy). I still haven't found one I like more than Blood Meridian but I haven't been disappointed yet either."
