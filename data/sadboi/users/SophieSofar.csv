In the UK from my experience a doctor can sign a DNAR without the consent of the family if its in the best interest of the patient and they wouldn't have a good quality of life. I shockingly found this out when transporting a man that had two cardiac arrests in the space of 6 weeks and his family knew nothing about the order in place. It was signed directly before we left to transport him

unpopularopinion,fkrzj3g,t3_fk6141,1584479162.0,"This is an example of modern mass hysteria. There is a risk, yes but not as big as people are reacting as. 


People who say they're high risk but don't bother to actually research if their condition is really grind my gears. 

It just seems like people are really misinformed and fail to do their own research. I don't mean genuine conditions such as COPD etc. When people see high risk as like they're going to die when they're a healthy 20 year old with Mild seasonal asthma. Then they end up taking up medical resources due to feeling unwell but nothing that needs medical attention.

Take the initiative and research the actual facts and statistics before you absolutely loose your shit and post it over your Facebook. A good friend did this recently and when I asked what medical conditions she had as I was worried (I'm also from a medical background) walls went up and said 'she didn't need to disclose medical information to anyone but her doctor'...
