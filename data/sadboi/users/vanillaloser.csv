Boise,fld0hoc,t1_flcxypt,1585053160.0,I usually got my responses months after I emailed. I’m glad to no longer be his constituent.
ptsd,flczcqh,t3_fnxgtl,1585052151.0,"Really feeling this with you. Much of my trouble comes from a workplace experience a few years ago and working from home causes a lot of stress for me. On top of that, I’m just an anxious person so this has consumed a lot of me.

I’ve been making time for meditation, taking walks, and being as mindful as I can. It’s helping."
ptsd,fl5dmct,t3_fl1ecl,1584834267.0,"Yes. Absolutely. I started working for a veteran focused org recently and at the same time I’m finally understanding myself, I also face this same issue. It feels like my problems are so minimal compared to almost everyone, that I must be making it up.

But at the same time I’m finally understanding the depression I’m finally out of, the brain fog I still have, and the horrible flashbacks that I thought were normal (lol! how did I convince myself they were normal!)"
PandR,fjielb8,t3_fdb81f,1583365942.0,he absolutely did.
logodesign,fjgtdib,t1_fjgszjw,1583335096.0,"The syntax of that doesn’t make sense for the topic. When you go to a concert, you go “down in the pit” (the pit is the floor).

Also, the name is not something I can change."
personalfinance,fjgr3fs,t1_fjgoqqw,1583333694.0,Uber uses a pay card. Probably even more simple than this
logodesign,fjgqlmo,t1_fjgq8o5,1583333378.0,Not the first time I’ve heard this! I love that someone pointed him out to me! :)
logodesign,fjgorf3,t1_fjfs0mm,1583332178.0,"as a brand name, it's actually one word - downinthepit. I can't do much without actually changing the structure of how it's referenced."
logodesign,fjghwx0,t1_fjggkir,1583327102.0,I’m kind of enjoying that people see a couple different things
logodesign,fjge3i7,t1_fjg8xoq,1583323636.0,"Care to elaborate? 

Edit: this isn’t sarcasm or snark. Genuinely looking for feedback"
logodesign,fjflhwv,t1_fjfjsa7,1583294290.0,"I'll take it! Ha. Thank you, I appreciate your input!"
Logo_Critique,fjf9jan,t3_fd5owy,1583287166.0,"I've been playing with this logo for a bit and I'm curious to see if anything stands out.

Also, I'd like to know what you see when you look at it (visually or any associations you have). It sort of feels familiar and I'm worried I may have copied something existing.

Anyway, this is for an indie/alt music publication. Their current logo is dated and didn't speak to the concept of music (or really anything, for that matter).

Any thoughts/criticism is welcome!"
logodesign,fjf5d0b,t1_fjf4jia,1583284656.0,"See we've talked about it for a while. We know, but we thought the abstract presentation could distract.

Honestly, it's not a huge worry since the content isn't like... super serious. We're currently viewing it as almost an easter egg? If that makes sense.  


I really do appreciate the feedback though. Thank you."
