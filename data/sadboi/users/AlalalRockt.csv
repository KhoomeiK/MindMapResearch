tipofmytongue,f71qxdv,t1_f6z74g7,1573346171.0,Nah the one I’m looking for is more folkish. Thank you tho

Thank you!"
tipofmytongue,f6y6b59,t1_f6y62zo,1573268997.0,No the song I’m looking for is more like a traditional folk song that’s been remixed. But I can see where you’re coming from with that suggestion
tipofmytongue,f6y6169,t3_dtqbi7,1573268751.0,"The song I think is kinda of old but still made in the 2000s. The original is pretty folkish and doesn’t have any instruments. It’s all done acapella by 3 women. It’s ok if no one can find it. It’s a weird song

Edit: I’m pretty sure you can find the remix in that weird section of YouTube with “powerful vocals”  or something similar too that"
mentalhealth,f6y5dm3,t3_dtmqje,1573268173.0,Happy Birthday!! You’re a really brave person for everything thing you’ve done and been through. I hope you try enjoy the rest of your birthday. Best of wishes🎉🎉
mentalhealth,f614y1p,t1_f5zwq8k,1572633201.0,Sorry it took so long to apply. But I’m leaning towards it that being a cause bc I sometime do what I do walking and not listening to music. Also minus the rocking bc that would look weird.
mentalhealth,f606vv6,t1_f5zreo3,1572607908.0,I’m pretty sure I don’t have autism but I looked to it. It does sound like it but what I read sounds like stimming make the person doing it unaware to a certain again. I’m completely awake and can stop whenever. Like if a person opens the door to me room I can stop immediately.  But it is a strong possibility
