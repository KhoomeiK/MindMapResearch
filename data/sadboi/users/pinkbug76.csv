Parenting,fhov45w,t3_f44qbs,1581774871.0,My story.  Three adults with one kid in a shopping mall.  Kid gets lost in a split second.  We found him but this happens.   All is okay now hunny.  You are not an awful person.  You are human.  Your girlfriend obviously has never had this happen.  I pray she never does.  Hugs.
FarmTogether,fhmdgj7,t3_f3vljk,1581711410.0,Maybe it‚Äôs because they are saving it for friends?   Then I guess they could just change settings though?   I understand why you can‚Äôt talk to people.  It keeps people from being rude to others.  Maybe though if there was certain bubbles you could use as emotes ?   Like please don‚Äôt pick or something?   If they do pick then exit forsure.   I don‚Äôt know just some ideas.
