BipolarReddit,fetnak9,t3_eqih2j,1579377137.0,"I understand that feeling.  To me depression and mania are both just anger.  Depression is anger turned inward and mania is anger turned outward. 

So I get depressed when I let the world tell me who I am.  And I get manic when I fight back. Telling the world this is who I am.  

Both are always you. Both are part of you. 

So finding the balance of how much you let the outer world effect you.  And how much you let your inner thoughts affect your actions.  

It is a struggle.  But anger is just energy in your body that needs to be put somewhere. 

So if you can see a version of yourself in hypomania that you want to be, remember that part.  And try to figure out a way to put your life more inline with that self image. 

But any change is hard and any version of yourself will be a struggle to bring to reality. 

So if you see something you want to be. Explore it. Try to understand it. And if you want.  Try to be it. 

That is my thought. 

Hope it shows you there are always options and sides of yourself you can always explore.

My ever-changing fractured images of self...that will always create a beautiful mosaic of me."

BipolarReddit,fdlonpd,t3_elxx82,1578528825.0,"theory UP time...

sounds like there is friction on roles...your sister....can ""say"" your the one with problem....due to your visible history but she is probably doing that to protect herself....so she pulls away when you need comfort...so 

my advice....let your sister be your sister....


and figure out what works for you....

so sister is not a good source for you to feel safe sharing....but you have here...  :)

next thing.... 

bring these questions up with your doctor...

prozac is a generation 1 ....psychotic medication

gen 2 and gen 3 have gotten fda approval....so ask if there is anything better that might work for you.


third if you don't feel safe sharing here...and you rather have some one on one....

either try looking again for a therapist/therapy..... that is right for you...


be it...art...sharing here....making funny faces in mirror for ""sisters"" eyes....

whatever....

but keep trying to figure out what works and take notes for yourself....

so you can see what works for you and what does not...

Deal?"
bipolar,fdceaz6,t3_ekl2et,1578272794.0,"Sooo much stress that you get lost in all the things you need to do but never decide on where to start and not finishing the ones you do.  To help push that further....imagine a horrible future with no escape.....then that moment of panic before a deadline.  That would be my route to mania....add in family or loved ones pressure and constant interruptions so you can never focus long enough figure out which is right way....

imagine setting gps to one coffee shop that you never been to before but then play a song while driving and going on autopilot to your normal one with the navigation commands always telling you to make a U-turn and you never get to hear your song without commands telling you are going the wrong way.

atleast that route triggers me the most...but 


best way for me to focus....clean off a workspace, empty table ....desk  depends on topic....then set a timer to take a break or to eat....just a reminder to take care of yourself while focusing on one task....or put yourself in corner so you have no distractions....but people are different....some need silence to study and some need loud distractions to focus....

either way always just about whatever helps you get you where going and keeps you focused and motivated toward deadline.  After that it becomes what did i finish and what is next.  Take your time, write your own notes that make sense to you, and the rest is (his/her)story.

best example driving in the night....you don't need to see all the way down the road.  The headlights are enough to get you a bit closer to your goal/destination"

An artistic statement of how I feel like everyONE can control  themselves  sexually(I have old sexual hang ups triggered by exes) and cutting off a part of ME that is best described as MAD SCIENTIST experimenting on finding MY  sexually PREFERENCES as i explore sex as MASTER or SLAVE to discover ME sexually again.


 I found being a SWITCH allowed me to flow from being a MASTER or slave of MY urges


or translated as an example of bipolar management/creativity repressing my exploration of finding ME aGAIN....


or you can be a slave to your thoughts and fight your desires ....


but that only leaves you in a state...where one is bound by social norms....
instead of the freedom to be a someONE that is YOU.... 

so I like SYMBOLIC representation of a thought with a flair of CREATIVITY in BEING...

(psst i was a programmer than can command machine, but I never wanted to control people,  because of my dreamed everyone being able to LOVE yourself despite your flaws)

Thought it was funny as I was just sitting there rolling the eraser into two balls.  And had to decided what I needed to do in the moment.  Take the pain meds that they give or take the pain relieve that I like.  So one way left.... one way right.

Tried some community painting workshops but never really understood it, not enough practice.  But was very good at shapes and creating interesting designs on close ups. But way out practice these days.  Allowing myself one drink of caffeine in the morning then taking time to draw.  While I have some energy.  But body not used to moving.   So starting over again.

Day 20 creates a great sense wonder in finding beauty in yourself.  

Maybe a different zoom or a different viewpoint would help change the way you create.   Have you tried a top down view or a bottom up view?  Would love to see you experiment with angle of portrait.  

I like using mirrors at odd angles. My favorite is the 3 quarters view eye level looking at self from mirror.  Creates a nice profile of shape of face.  

Loved the outfit.  So carefree...warm comfortable clothes, pants hems a perfect height for your legs.  And incredible shoes.
