My auntie graduated at 38 with 4 young daughters to look after! 
I’m planning on doing an open university course which means I’ll be in my mid-late 30s when I graduate and I had no idea of what career I wanted until last year so I still haven’t ever been to uni. 

Please believe in yourself, who cares what year you finally got there? I’d rather keep learning and evolving in my life than being stuck in the same career from 21-80 (when I’ll finally be allowed to retire in the uk)!! 🧡"
mentalhealth,fgfcsd3,t1_fgdz2ac,1580734707.0,Thank you for this. I forgot how good they made me feel and I had no idea that that was their goal! I listened to them on my way to work and I remember they were who I was listening to when I was super down as a teenager <3

KindVoice,fgfazn5,t1_fge3dyn,1580732885.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words! 
I have seen a couple of therapists but unfortunately I can't afford to go private and they only offer a certain amount of sessions on the NHS so it has been quite tough to really speak to someone to get to the bottom of it. 
I'm currently under a specialist who has assessed me and I'll be going to an appointment on Thursday to have a medical review but to me right now with how I'm feeling, being weened off of my medication and then put back on more just to see if they might work is just too long and I am too tired to fight :("

StopSelfHarm,fgdv97j,t3_exvo53,1580687279.0,"Huge congratulations!!!! Massive admiration for you. Never be too hard on yourself if you do relapse though, there’ll be a time when this will be even longer. Thinking of you 🧡"
selfharm,ffv2sef,t3_evc8se,1580254355.0,"When I was a teenager at school, I used to notice that my mum would take my nail scissors out of my room and put them in the bathroom as though she was ‘tidying up’. She’d never say anything but I also know she didn’t really believe the lies I told about why my stomach and arms had scratches though she’d never tell me that. 

She wasn’t ever mad with me, I think she did it as a way to 1. Know when I was doing it since I’d take them back into my room and so then she’d know when I was struggling and 2. It was her way of trying to show me she cares and hopes I don’t keep doing it without confronting me about it because I think she worried she’d seem like she was telling me off which would make me want to do it more.
I’m now nearly 27 and after two suicide attempts, I’m able to freely talk about it with her when I relapse. She doesn’t understand it completely but she tries to and she knows that it’s something I need to do. She’s currently trying to find ways for me to replace it which I’m so grateful for.

What I’m trying to say is that your mum loves you unconditionally and your teen years make it so hard for you to be open with your parents about it but I don’t believe for a second that they really judge us. 
I really hope you’re able to get to the place where me and my mum are one day 🧡"
selfharm,ffv1936,t3_evcub1,1580253363.0,"Op, I am not encouraging your sh in any shape or form but you mustn’t feel weak. Everyone sh in their own way and to their own pain needs.
I have felt before that because I don’t sh to excessive bleeding that I’m not doing it right but that’s just not true, I’m doing what I need at that time. 
I’m really hoping you’re able to get some kind of help to see how wonderful you are and I am always around if you need to be picked up. 
Please remember how strong you really are to be able to open your eyes each morning 🧡"

No one really understands quite why I do it and it’s hard to talk to people about having the urge to cut :("
selfharm,ffv0ild,t3_ev6jhz,1580252903.0,"I hear you Op and just know you aren’t alone. 
I’m currently on my journey to finding out what happiness is again and you may relapse but I hope that you’ll be with me on this journey rather than succumbing to your sadness because we do deserve to be happy even if we can’t fully see it when we’re down. 

Stay safe Op, I will be here with you 🧡"
selfharm,ffuzwvc,t3_evb298,1580252561.0,"I chew on my lips and the inside of my gums often until they’re really sore as a way to try and stimulate when I am anxious, though I often don’t realise I’m doing it, which I consider a form of self harming because I’m doing it to harm myself and also make myself feel calmer.
I know that some people pull their hair or eyelashes out as a form of self harm too, I don’t believe it always means cutting or burning at all. 

I hope you’re doing okay Op!"
selfharm,ffrl0h5,t1_ffrh9fv,1580160203.0,"I sometimes have the weirdest feeling that our pets know we deserve the love back that we give to them. They see the good in us that we aren’t able to.
My cat came into my life the day before my Nonna’s (grandma in Italian) funeral when I really wasn’t coping well because my Nonna was my most favourite human being in the whole world. I often think she sent me Puddy Tat as lame as that sounds :)"

I have and have had so many hobbies meant to keep me distracted and it works so well in the day/evening. It’s these times at night just before I go to sleep when I have nothing to do but think and there just isn’t anything in that moment that can distract me and that’s what scares me. 
I handmade all of my Christmas gifts as I taught myself to embroider and make Christmas decorations and trinket dishes out of clay. I was busy every evening for 2 months yet almost every night during that time, I managed to self harm right before sleep."
