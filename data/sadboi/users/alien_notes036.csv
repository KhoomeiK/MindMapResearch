**Intermittent loss of Wi-Fi connectivity**Some older computers may experience loss of Wi-Fi connectivity due to an outdated Qualcomm driver. An updated Wi-Fi driver should be available from your device manufacturer (OEM).  
To safeguard your upgrade experience, we have applied a hold on devices with this Qualcomm driver from being offered Windows 10, version 1903, until the updated driver is installed.  
**Affected platforms:**

* Client: Windows 10, version 1903

**Workaround:** Download and install an updated Wi-Fi driver from your device manufacturer (OEM). **Note** We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update using the **Update now** button or the Media Creation Tool until a new driver has been installed and the Windows 10, version 1903 feature update has been automatically offered to you.

&#x200B;

I updated to the latest driver I could find, still no 2019 update on Windows Update. I don't even know if my TP-Link TL-WN822N US ver 5 uses QUALCOMM components, the latest driver they have which is the one I was using is from 2018 but when I install it, it says 2015... Does anyone know if they are planning any fixes for this or something?"
