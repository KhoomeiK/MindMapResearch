Extremely interesting story about one of the greatest surfers of all time, Andy Irons, who overdosed. He was bipolar. His brother talks about Andy’s progression from their childhood surfing/competing together, and how it got to the point where he was getting manic and psychotic as a young adult. Extremely sad, but easily one of the best real-life movies/documentaries about the struggles of bipolar disorder.
