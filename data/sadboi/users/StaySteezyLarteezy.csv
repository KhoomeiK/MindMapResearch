That being said, I‚Äôve been through my own fair share of trauma in ways similar to you. The only thing that‚Äôs really been able to help me cope with my issues is knowing these people who passed on, especially someone as sweet as your friends was, they‚Äôre in a better place brother. They‚Äôre not suffering anymore, our time on Earth spend in varying degrees of suffering (or if you‚Äôre into Eastern ideals, satisfaction vs dissatisfaction). But wherever she is now just know she is at peace and in my opinion she‚Äôs watching over you. Life can throw you some absolute left hooks, but please take solace in the fact that your relationship with her was seemingly on the absolute best of terms. Think about how many people never get the opportunity to find love and happiness before they move on from this life. Y‚Äôall were able to give each other that and I think that‚Äôs incredibly powerful and special. She may not physically be with you anymore but we both know she would not want to see you like this. She will live on in your heart forever. Love is eternal. Become the person again you know she would want you to be. God bless my brother."

You can and will make it out of this situation and accomplish what you set out to achieve for yourself if you‚Äôre willing to work hard and have lots of mental toughness. The anxiety from this can seem immense at times so try to find healthy ways to cope now as it unfortunately will probably get worse before it gets better.
