AmItheAsshole,fnkzebc,t3_g2c1wp,1587043723.0,"NTA. I have a ps4 which I bought for myself at 13 only saving money, age isn't any excuse especially when OP says she does spend money. And not only that but you offered her another kind of payment and chose to do nothing about It. You have all the right for not letting her use it, after all it's your stuff and as you aren't entitled to her drawings she is neither entitled to use your switch"
mentalhealth,flukskh,t3_fr3hp9,1585504606.0,I don't know what is it that has happened to you but for my experience I can tell that trauma is about the way you feel about it not about the thing that happened. I've gone through physical and verbal abuse but none of those really affected me in a deep level because I was used to it until last year that I went through something really bad that didn't involve me getting physically harmed but it's something that still gets me nightmares almost every time I sleep. Don't let anyone tell you that what you feel is exaggerated or that what you've gone through isn't bad enough to cause you a real trauma.

AMA,ff4ymlq,t3_ere8pq,1579575597.0,"I’m so sorry you had to go through all that, although it was so brave of you calling the cops, I actually admire you because I’ve been in a similar situation for years and I still don’t have the guts to call the cops or to sue my mom.  I really don’t have any questions unless asking for advice counts as one but I’m really happy for you and for the fact that now you’re safe."
