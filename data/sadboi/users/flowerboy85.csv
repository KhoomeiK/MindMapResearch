muacjdiscussion,fbsk0q0,t3_ee9fax,1577056289.0,"i use both powder and liquid foundations, usually choosing powder when i‚Äôm in a rush. 

first i prep by applying moisturizer, my spf, and then i set my spf with loose powder. it might sound odd but it helps with oiliness throughout the day and it keeps my spf from lifting up when i apply my foundation. 

then, i do: spot concealing (if necessary), foundation, undereye concealer, and setting powder. 

i do eyes and brows next, then bronzer, blush, and highlight. i always do my lips last."
