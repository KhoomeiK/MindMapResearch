I'm sure a free standing unit will be fine. You mentioned to someone that you're worried about weight... But it should not be too big of a concern as long as you build or buy something sturdy. What kind of stuff is it? Just CD's, if so, almost any shelving unit you buy, made from wood, should hold it. I can't foresee many situations where a shelving unit wouldn't be able to handle the weight of CD'S. And if weight does become an issue, you can reinforce the weak spots.

Regarding screwing into the wall, if you don't want this thing to fall over, you will at least need to put a few screws in the top for safety... Why not just talk to your landlord and discuss it with them? Offer a $100 to $200 extra security deposit to patch & paint the wall after you leave. Patching and painting is not that hard. Usually there is other patching and painting that needs to be done when people move out anyway.

Tips for a strong wall unit. If you build or buy a wall unit, make sure not to use shelving with long horizontal shelves. Those will say over time... If you keep your horizontal shelves under about 2 ft long, sagging should not be a huge issue if youre using 5/8"" or thicker material. Go 3/4"" to be safe. 

Regarding using an expanding mechanism to prevent screw holes... This is an option, but it can also cause holes or damage to the ceiling. That kind of damage might actually be tougher to fix than screw holes in your wall. You would have to make sure that the expansion feet on the ceiling are expanding on an area of ceiling that is backed by a ceiling joist (framing in the ceiling).

The auto bed leveling was one of the things I wanted early on, but wasn't sure that I needed. I have found the same thing as you... That a few adjustments every week keep the bed nice and level... And I usually try to watch the first layer go down to catch and make any adjustments I need to make.

I actually have 2 printers, Ender 3 pro and also a Prusa i3 mk3s (I purchased this w a group of friends, we split the cost... My portion of the prusa was more than I paid for the entire ender 3 pro) . I like the Prusa auto bed leveling and other features, but I can honestly say that the ender 3 pro does almost identical prints with minimal effort from me. Both machines need z adjust, so it's not like there is a difference there... and I find z adjust is more tricky than leveling. it's really just auto bed level vs manual bed level... And that's not that much extra work, maybe 5 or 10 minutes every 1 to 2 weeks. It's well worth the cost difference.

The Prusa can also handle more types of materials stock that the ender 3 pro, but I print 95% in PLA anyway. To be honest, I'm not sure which materials the stock ender 3 can't do yet... I think maybe PETG, but that would be the only drawback. For what I do, I don't need to use PETG, so it makes no difference.

I am totally sold on the ender 3 and could not be happier. Like you, working w the ender has taught me a lot about 3d printing. I'm not sure how far I will go with mods, but I will be starting to plan my hero me direct drive soon!

I want to add a big thing though, the first time I started going,I felt a huge relief, and just the fact I went, gave me hope and confidence because I knew I was doing something about my issues. I felt a little bit better just knowing that I was doing something positive to be a better person and work on my issues. In fact, I felt a sense of relief before I even went to my first appointment. Just scheduling the appointment made me feel a little bit better. And that effect happened Everytime I scheduled an appointment or went to an appointment. It's a simple concept, when you actively do something to better yourself, it gives you hope and confidence, and that can make a huge difference.

My other advice is to keep looking for the right doctor or therapist for you. Always go to your appointments, but if you don't feel totally comfortable with a given therapist, keep looking for and trying new ones until you find the one that you click with.

I have been planning my mods, but after seeing the amount of work involved in some of the upgrades, such as direct drive, and automatic bed leveling, I have been hesitant. For some reason, I originally thought most of the upgrades would simply be ""plug and play"", but some require flashing the firmware, cutting/splicing wires, purchasing $50 to $100 worth of hardware, etc. 

These things aren't necessarily hard to do or out of my budget, but I'm taking a closer look at the value I'm getting by doing them. I have done most of the cheap and easy things, like adding a glass bed, and all the 'free' printable mods, but the rest of the upgrades that are left to do are going to cost money and time.

So my question to u is: Out of all the mods you did, which ones made the biggest impact for you? Given the cost vs benefit. Do you have any advice on this?

LifeProTips,fpisgod,t1_fpio9pt,1588647693.0,"I totally know what you're saying... There are definitely things that I need to recognize that could become a problem and I have to make sure she knows not to do certain things unless dad and mom are around. Fortunately she has decent common sense and she is a good kid, so she usually is on the cautious side of things

One of my favorite examples of ""teaching her too much"" was when she was younger and I really wanted her to learn how to open doors. Then she learned, then I regretted she could open doors lol.

Generally though, I try not to hold anything back from her because she is such a good kid (so far) I don't hesitate to reach her stuff as long as I make sure to tell her the rules when I'm not around.

I have definitely taught her how dangerous mains electricity can be. Sometimes, if I need to show her how dangerous something can be, I will find a non-violent or non-gory YouTube video to show what getting shocked by electricity can do.

I'm glad you brought this up because it's an important reminder for parents to be smart about what and how they teach their kids"
LifeProTips,fpie8hf,t3_gdmnt5,1588639100.0,"Totally!

I just try to introduce my 4 year old girl to as many things as possible... we learn electronics tinkering together, we do basic woodwork, we draw, color, computer tablet art, frisbee, bike, photography, baseball, soccer, piano, harmonica, etc etc etc. I never force anything, but I always make sure it's available and offered. We usually do each thing for a few minutes, then move on when she gets bored.

Turns out she has been totally digging photography. I tried to let her use one of my nicer cameras to take pictures, but she is attached to her $20 camera, intended for kids. It has like .0001 megapixels (/s actually has like 2 mp) delayed shutter, etc. Worst camera EVER!!! but she loves it and takes pride in her pictures, so I just roll with it and we'll ask her to take pictures for us. 

I always make sure to introduce her to stuff, but never to force it. And I always have many activities ready for her each day."

3Dprinting,fpd3o53,t1_fpc7nms,1588519161.0,"It's funny, I only printed the knob because some YouTuber said it was an easy printed mod to add. I just figured it would help me monitor whether the feeder was working or not. Only after I installed it did I realize it was actually functional for manually feeding the filament.

Good luck!"
3Dprinting,fpd3h4w,t1_fpc7nmq,1588519046.0,"Those are some good ideas... Especially the retraction thing, I haven't seen that trick written about before. That's some pro level stuff right there... You're 'stepping' up my game (pun sort of intended).

Thx!"
3Dprinting,fpd2yyu,t1_fpc85ys,1588518736.0,"Yeah, I try to avoid manually moving anything, but when I feed the filament with the knob, I turn the knob maybe 4 or 5 stepper clicks... It's  almost nothing. It's just enough to get the filament from outside of the hole to inside of the hole, then I push it the rest of the way through. 

I should have mentioned the risk of using the knob and specifying how very little turning is needed. Thanks for mentioning this. 

Despite the risk, I still manually move the bed as well, I just go slow and hope it doesn't screw it up... But it is a risk I'm taking."

3Dprinting,fpc6z0s,t3_gcm90x,1588489703.0,"I found it helps to strategically bend and/or cut the filament at the necessary angle to thread into the hole easier... U gotta make a ~45° cut so the pointy part is closely lined up w the hole. The filament usually wants to hit the edge of the hole closest to the front of the machine, so make the sharp tip of the 45° cut into the side of filament on the side of the filament towards the rear of the machine

***Special note, sometimes you don't need to cut the filament at an angle, there is a trick that works part of the time: print and install a ""filament feeder knob"" (I think that's what it's called). It attaches to the top of the main feeder gear. It allows you to turn the gear and feed manually. Then, when u insert filament into the gears, turn the filament feeder knob and sometimes it will just push the filament into the hole. For some reason I think turning the knob helps line up the filament too. After filament is inserted, press the release spring and push the filament the rest of the way to the hot end"
