StreetsofRage,fqd02cg,t3_gi6240,1589274913.0,"Yeah I'm ok with it, understand it's a bit of an anticlimax much in the same vain as action movies where main villian often dies without putting up much of a fight.

Not sure how many ppl need to take a cut but for arguments sake say its 20 and assuming everyone who follows the SOR4 fb page which is 20k buys the title that's roughly 30 US dollars. That's 600k or 30k pp, now double for those who get it but arent fb followers. 60k over 4 years so 15k each not taking expenses for production into account. Not sure whether working on the project is a full time job but i imagine theres alot of unpaid passion thats gone into it. I'd have happily paid $50 but know its not a huge game compared to other titles so have to meet the market. Sound logic or have i missed something? If this is the case i think it, we as smitten fans, our duty to dip into our pockets for some DLC"
StreetsofRage,fpr1180,t1_fpngj36,1588838614.0,Yeah agreed re acid and i must have missed the stages where u start off with limited health. Its a better way to integrate specials like an amalgamation of SOR2 & 3 special mechanics.

StreetsofRage,fpn8npf,t3_gea0yl,1588754076.0,"Nice guide. Might i add another pointer in relation to specials i just discovered and makes them so much more enticing to use. The replenishing bar: after using a special, depending on how powerful it is, will use a certain amount of energy that can be reclaimed through successive hits to enemies though take a single hit and it stop refilling. A very novel great feature"

Get there in the end but I'm now confused how its being reported 2 mil users have downloaded it but playstore only shows 100k+. Are the other 1.9mil iPhone users?
