depression,fr4xhfr,t1_fr4w6d4,1589898732.0,"I totally get that it’s so freaking hard to be patient, you wanna feel better ASAP. But it really does take time. It takes time to find the right medication for you; make sure your psychiatrist is really trying understand your particular brain chemistry and what you’re lacking because a lot of my past ones would just throw meds at me if I said it wasn’t working instead of finding out why. “Oh it didn’t work? Let’s just try this one, come back in a month.” It takes time to find the right therapist too, and the coping methods that work for you personally. One thing that someone told me that has resonated with me is that I shouldn’t feel ashamed to feel my feelings and acknowledge that I do feel like shit and be okay with that!"
depression,fr4vvbq,t3_gmlcj2,1589897863.0,"I feel like no one really understands the pain that you must really have to be in to wanna take your own life until they’ve experienced it themselves. Yes, people will see how unhappy you are, but this isn’t the way to go about it. 

It can be so hard to open up to people about how you really feel because you don’t wanna scare anyone or have them think you’re crazy or even have them belittle your issues. From my experience, communication is really key. 

When I tried to kill myself almost 3 years ago, I regretted it so much. Not to get into details, but I overdosed on my antidepressants. When I was having trouble breathing I got really scared and texted a friend to come to my apartment. Just like others have said, no one who is suicidal actually wants to die, they just wanna escape the pain that they’re experiencing. 

I used to be convinced that my life was going to be horrible forever. Not saying that I’m perfectly fine now but I have made SO MUCH progress. Some days are still rough and I go through a depressive episode, but what matters is that I bounce back from it. Things do get better, I promise!!

Everything truly does happen for a reason. You might not find out what that reason is for years! But I know now that I went through everything I did so that I can hopefully help others realize that you can get through it. Please don’t give up."
CamGirlProblems,fpjypf8,t1_fpj21y1,1588684318.0,Do you ever feel like the cup gets in the way? I think what has made me not use the cup is that it sits in the vaginal canal so I can’t really do any kind of repeated penetration. But besides that I love that it’s reusable. I think I’m gonna go get one. 😅
CamGirlProblems,fpjybrv,t1_fpjp71g,1588684065.0,Good idea! I always forget about those. My only worry with those is me accidentally pushing it out or using it on a heavier day.
CamGirlProblems,fpjy3im,t3_gdrllk,1588683911.0,"I’m also a black cam girl, but I’m still very new. I 100% understand how you feel. I don’t think that I have the stereotypical black girl body either. I’m on the slim side but I have like no butt or curves lol. 

However, if I were you I wouldn’t try to pose as something you’re not. Like I said before, I’m new but I have noticed some things! One is that being authentically you is the best thing you can do. The number one thing my clients say they love about me is my personality. I feel like as long as you exude confidence the right people will be drawn to you. 

Other people may have already said this too but I don’t focus too much on how much money I make at this point since I’m just starting out. I understand that’s hard to do when you’re camming to make a living though! Regardless, try not to let it upset you and just focus on the engagement from your audience and being consistent. Sometimes just sitting there and smiling or lip syncing to music when no one is engaging helps to pass time but also not look bored. 

Another thing I’ve learned is to make your audience feel special. When someone comes into your room make sure you say their name and greet them. If they thought about leaving they might decide to stay a little longer."
CamGirlProblems,fpjwnpl,t3_gdr8vb,1588682924.0,"I’m still very new to camming, but of course I also have tons of people ask to talk to me outside of the site.

The key is to put in a new disc right before you start streaming and you’ll be good way past the end of your show."
CamGirlProblems,fpira54,t3_gdphlm,1588646949.0,"I’m still very new to camming, but the first time I did a show I was on my period lol. I wear a menstrual disc so I was still able to play with toys and such. The cramps do still suck but usually an orgasm or two helps me feel better until I can cuddle up in bed with my heating pad. I know some people aren’t very comfortable with it, though."
CamGirlProblems,fpcty7r,t3_g8cco7,1588512604.0,"How long do you think it took for that to happen? I’ve already started and at this point I’m definitely in too deep, I don’t see myself stopping any time soon. Surprisingly, I don’t feel as freaked out about people finding out as I feel like I should be. Worst case scenario, my parents kick me out (which is REALLY the worst thing that could happen cause my parents wouldn’t just put me out like that). I plan on moving out by next summer, but if I continually do better than I am now with camming it’s possible that I could move out before then."
CamGirlProblems,fp5y7hd,t1_fp4xg00,1588342426.0,"VERY TRUE. I definitely told my client to pay me before we got on, which he did and also tipped me again after we were done since I “made his day” haha. And yeah I did read that Skype is against CB’s TOS so usually clients will email me, since I have my camming email in my wishlist for Amazon gift cards. I haven’t done any password shows yet, but not doing them during my scheduled show time is very good advice that I never thought about. Thank you!!"
CamGirlProblems,fowf4pm,t1_fowdsq7,1588118559.0,"That’s so awesome! I think I definitely will tell them as soon as I’m very successful because at that point I’ll definitely be independent from them.

CamGirlProblems,foqoqdz,t1_foq8grh,1587998008.0,"That makes sense. Do you think cam SCs could pop up in google even if I use a stage name? Also, I’m worried that my parents really wouldn’t approve while I’m still living with them. If I was living on my own then I would be a lot more comfortable bringing it up to them.

most of the situations were me allowing these guys to know too much about me (my mental health disorders) and let them know about my extreme longing to not be alone. others were guys i wanted to smoke weed with and they decided they wanted to do other things... 

in high school i was very promiscuous - because of the 6/7 years that i had a family friend molesting me when i was way younger, typical story i suppose - so i put myself into a lot of dangerous situations in an attempt to take control of my sexuality. all of these things happened in the guys’ homes. 

i didn’t realize the reality of what was happening until after many tearful therapy sessions. i’m still very ashamed of myself for letting those things happen to me. but at least i’ve learned to be careful with the guys i hang out with and to never let anyone get away with hurting me!"
