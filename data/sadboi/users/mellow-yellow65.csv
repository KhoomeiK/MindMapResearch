depression,fka3x2g,t3_fh565g,1583991621.0,"I wish I had your strength.  I am in the beginning stages is allowing my voice to be heard & if people don't Luke it, tough. But it goes against my nature.  My biological mother has always ingrained in me to 1, be subservient to the men in the family, including my younger brothers, 2, this was the basic. Statement: ""no one really cares about your issues, I'll help you watch your kids, but put them to sleep before you leave"" 

My sister is the youngest & she was the princess in the family, now that she's 40 she's a spoiled hellacious bitch. 

He final straw I wrote my mother a letter telling her I feel, I. Got this first response that I'm to sensitive & my sister thinks your the worst example of a sister.  I finally had it & sent her an email telling her to go her way, I understand she can't fully be a mother to me.  (I was raised by grandparents but didn't find out till I was 17.) I told her I understand that she's not capable of loving me as a daughter & it's ok. I told her my sister is no one to talk & she's been a bitch since I had kids when she was 10 & hated my kids upon birth. That as far as I'm concerned I don't have a sister.  I wished her the best telling her I'm going to block her & to please let me be.  I got a letter in the mail that if I talk about her or my evil 1/2 sister they would take me to court & get a restraining order against me as well as sue me for slander & pain & suffering signed by both of them. 

I thought I would cry, but I didn't.  I felt so peaceful. So little by little I'm seeing friends & family who really care vs their frustration dealing with my depression &/or lupus.  Be strong. Your not alone. We are all here sharing our struggles & listening to you with love & virtual hugs."

depression,fk3hakb,t3_fg6zrm,1583833492.0,"That happened to me with a former friend. We knew each other since 7th grade. We partied, we went to clubs, we danced, we did so much.  My family basically abandoned me which is a long story, but trust me, it's not because I did something. Anyway because what happened in my childhood, it finally came to a head where I was no longer fun, I wasn't funny anymore. She went so far to admit that she just doesn't want to be around my sadness & that she knows she's selfish but ""I'm being honest"". That hurt me so deep because her mom took me in & her family treated me like I was family. She just didn't want to be the one to have to be there for me. This is someone I spent almost 40 years of friendship, 1 sided friendship.  I was maid of honor in her first wedding, she was mine for my wedding. I was in so much pain I couldn't breathe. How am i suppose to live without her in my life. I questioned myself, devalued myself & put on a show so she would still be my friend.

But she got divorced, I was there for her. Her kids grew up with mine. But when my life started to get better emotionally,  my husband is my angel, so loving & patient. He was very upset with her. I mean a big chunk of my life she was in it.

Well, I called her in March 2013. I remember that because we (the hubby & I were planning a trip. I wanted to tell her about, she had met a new man, I wanted to know about him, I never met him. So I called, texted & called & I'm not exaggerating, 1 year & 3 months, not 1 return call or text. A couple of replies on Facebook with promises of returning my call. 

So after the 1 year 3 month time, it gave me alot of time to really opened my eyes. I had to find my worth & I did. I called 1 more time & she answered. I didn't even know what to say anymore being ghosted for over a year. 

She apologized,  she always knew I would get over as I did any other selfish crap she did. Not this time. I full on confronted her about so many things & said I will never call her again, I'm a good friend, I deserve it. I deserve a friend who wants to be my friend.  Told her I'm glad she answered the phone so I can get it all off my chest. She called me dramatic, I said I may be dramatic but I'm a loyal & good friend she will no longer have me in my life. 

I had cried too many years for her & my parents. I was done. Unfriended her on Facebook & moved on. Never got an apology. Nothing. Well she recently got married & of course I was not the maid of honor. I also was not invited to the wedding.

A mutual friend told me that on occasion she will ask about me. My friend kept her answers vague. But she once said, oh, I love her but I don't feel like hearing what a bad friend I am. üòÇ

I told her the next time she asked about me, tell her that even if she did call me, not to flatter herself. Tell her that no one takes up space in my mind & heart rent free. So I'm fine, thank you, go, be well.

I was ok. I couldn't believe how I let this get me feeling so low that I was willing to be used as a 1 sided friendship.  I still suffer from depression, but standing up to her, not being scared about what she will say. I was free. My husband is my best friend.  My religion has provided me with some wonderful friends.  So if I have bad days, they call, come visit, bring food. Now I was blessed with many by losing one friend. 

If you want to remain friends I suggest being honest with her. Ask her why you weren't invited, was her family giving her heat for you not to be invited? Ask her if she still values you as a friend & be honest about the future of this friendship.  Are you going to be excluded from any of her gatherings? Don't wait like I did. It will hurt even more later. Thoughts & prayers...üò¢üôèüèº"

family,fjwz8sg,t3_fez1fh,1583650015.0,"I am going to say I understand.  I had a hefty inheritance. My parent passed away with a will that gave my father most of the inheritance,  my brothers & sisters were in goe a shock as I was,  (I was only 16 when this happened, & the baby of the family) in order for mom to get her last word she left each one of my siblings who were much older.  The us a 23 year difference from me & the sister before me. The older sister got a home as a gift. Every thing else,  jewelry, wedding bands, fur coats (now that I'm an adult I wouldn't of wanted them; but just all the beautiful expensive clothes & jewels were to go to me & a super sizable cash in the bank. Well,  once she waac gone my father turned around & & allow my oldest sister & kids to rummage through everything first, then allow the rest of the siblings to forage through what was left. Now as a 16 year old, I didn't know about $$ or a will, all I knew was my mom was gone. Well this will was drawn up in a time where there were no such thing as a trust fund. So my father was supposed to give it to me when I was 25.  I'm 55 now. Anyway,  my father turned into a casanova while I was growing up & was going to Hawaii with women,  Las Vegas  trips & I was always left me by myself.  Ok, no surprise I hardly seen except to ensure there was food & my allowance of $200.00 a week. So naturally I went wild.  Mostly marijuana, acid & alcohol. But I out grew all that.  Anyway,  during his lifetime he bought me 2 cars, a crib for my now 34 year old, & a TV & $5,000. For whatever I wanted.  

Well when I reached my 40's I was struggling & one of my siblings asked me if I knew I was supposed to get this $$$ & mentions 2 homes & 2 plots of land. I was super shocked. So I went to my father & confronted him. He said he doesn't have it any more & he & his current wife from hell are barely getting by on their pensions & SSI. Well, I figured I can't miss what I didn't know I had.  I was hurt because I could have been a much more successful person with a little help. So I let it go. 

Well fast forward 2 years & my father calls me to come over.  He sits me down & apologizes for the will from my mom but he bought a $10,000 life insurance & he wants me to see I a.m the beneficiary.  I was surprised & told him he didn't have to do that.  He insisted it was the right thing to do. I said ok.  Thank you & I hope to not get it anytime soon.  I used to think I was a daddy's girl. 

Well fast forward, I'm living 5 hours away & one of my siblings calls me, daddy is very sick. I pack my bags & rush there. I'm sitting at his bedside as the doctor says he has lung cancer & won't make it past 6 months. I was destroyed because I really thought my daddy loved me even though he basically took all the money was wasted on his witch of a wife & gambling.  So I say daddy,  is there anything I need to take car of, Bill's, the car payment so whatever he needs to help his witch wife. He says well I have $75,000 in the house in a dresser & I swear to you it never occurred to me to even ask about the money being for me. I just asked if he wants me to deposit it. His wife walked in & she doesn't speak very good English but she is mad cuz $$ is what she heard.  I know this is long, but i just need to say what I feel is important. 

Well, within 3 weeks my father feel asleep in death. I cried 3 3vdays straight. I was told to come to his house to get what I want. I said I couldn't,  I can't drive, I can't think. Money never entered my mind.  Well my brother calls me && says sis, I gotta tell you something.  Dad changed the Insurance policy to his wife.

I can't tell you how broken I felt. It wasn't about the money. It was about betrayal to me. It was as if my whole relationship with him was a lie. He never had to promise me a life insurance policy. I just loved no matter what he did. But the fact he could of made something right for me or my children & chose to pick his wife who laughed at me & all the women when I was a teen into my 20's he always picked them. I just didn't want to see that my father was just over me. I no longer mattered to him. He put up with me cuz he felt he had no choice. 

Well, what I'm going to say is your grandma & even your dad can change things but you won't know if it would come true.  I had to seek therapy because of the fact that my father abandoned me when I was 16 & could care less where I slept as long as it was not at his & his girlfriend's & later his wife's home.  It's a hard pill to swallow but I prayed, I spoke with my husband & I finally had to move on. I understand that the point is not the money. It's the wish of your grandfather & even grandmother & someone then influences them & then your out.  Maybe your father can read this story, because as outrageous it sounds, every bit is true. I could write a book about the whole ordeal, but I wanted you to know that $$ sometimes makes people not do the right thing.  I truly hope your dad pays for your school & rent so you will never have to feel like you need someone's $$ & do right buy your future children. Make a good life. My dad checked out when I was 16. I had no skills, didn't know what to do except party till I had kids. But someone stepped up when I was 21 & gave me a job in an attorneys office. I was his going to be his legal secretary,  I was & he paid for my paralegal classes. I will never forget the kind man who died 5 years ago who gave me a chance. When I had no food, he & his wife took me shopping for my kids. He gave me alot of love. He was a wonderful father figure.  So even though my dad dropped the ball, someone gave me a chance. Good luck to you."
family,fjwvaz1,t3_ff7tqn,1583646793.0,"Idk, the way I see it is our parents put up with alot raising us so it is our opportunity to take care of them. Also it's a time to get to know them now & them you.  

I can understand your frustration. My in laws, mil, bil, sil barely tolerates me.  I have done nothing except love my husband.  But my mil & fil are ill & I suck it up when we go down there to help around the house, make things easier, I tel my husband that I can handle it now because I don't want him to have regrets if 1 and or both pass. 

So, one of the things I did for my father when he was ill & crotchety I made a list of questions for him. How he & my mother went, what was it like going to the Korean war.  I filled some of it.  But I found out so much I never knew.

As for them trying to help you & ending up making things worse, just try to have patience. Maybe you can allot time to visit their homes.  Be honest about the kids & toys for them.  Get puzzles & occupy their minds with the kids to do. I understand the frustration,  remember they were in you shoes at one time, love them & be patient because tomorrow is never promised & you wouldn't want anything to happen to them & your feelings were frustration.  

I say this from experience.  I waited to long & have so many questions.  I'm just happy to know I was there in his final moment.  You in laws do not seem to be during their visit,  it's more of inconvenience.  But remember,  your husband that you love, your in laws raised that man. I'm not discovering your feelings.  Very valid.  Just want to give you a different perspective.  I hope things get better."

He writes we're ""now you want to give het to me now that's she's ruined?but we developed a relationship but she never cared about my kids,  & now they have kids & she has not met 1 of my grandchildren.

I was shocked & appalled.  I sent het an email of how hurt she was and brought some personal things between us how it hurt me & to please let bnb me go, I will stand back & not contact her just let me heal my heart & move on. She sent me a cease & desist letter to not ever speak of her or my sister. I'm an ungrateful brat & my kids are going to hate me. So,  nail in coffin. I wish her no ill will but to be honest, I can't give my heart for it to be crushed on a regular basis.  So,  I never called or seen her since & life has been peaceful with respects to that part of my life.

Some will substitute fries with a fruit cup, or just the carbless entree & a bottle of water.  I've done that & its messy but it's actually good.

Carlos and Carmen Vidal just had a child
A lovely girl with a crooked smile
Now they gotta split 'cause the Bronx ain't fit
For a kid to grow up in
Let's find a place they say, somewhere far away
With no blacks, no Jews and no gays
Chorus:
There but for the grace of God go I

Poppy and the family left the dirty streets
To find a quiet place overseas
And year after year the kid has to hear
The do's the don'ts and the dears
And when she's ten years old she digs that rock 'n' roll
But Poppy bans it from home
Chorus

Baby, she turns out to be a natural freak
Popping pills and smoking weed
And when she's sweet sixteen she packs her things and leaves
With a man she met on the street
Carmen starts to bawl, bangs her head to the wall
Too much love is worse than none at all

My600lbLife,fj1szbe,t1_fj1jq0l,1582927086.0,I thought the exact same thing.
My600lbLife,fj1sus2,t3_fawj0f,1582927006.0,Jean Covey was nightmare.
My600lbLife,fj1ss56,t3_fawj0f,1582926962.0,"Exactly. Dr. Now offers psychotherapy & they bitch about it. They think weight loss surgery is some miracle for them, a magic pill. They don't want to put in the work. It's disgusting that they are suing. If you have an opportunity to change your life for the better, if you have to travel for hours & days in the back of a van with a mattress in the back & eat tons of fast food on they way & bully their loved ones, then feel like Dr. Now & the production company owes the world to them as they continue to make zero progress is disgusting.  

I heard about this lawsuit & all 3 of these people were pretty annoying. I read that l.b. Bonner's family is also suing because he committed suicide. I feel for them, can't imagine the heartbreak,  but he had those issues prior to the surgery. Prior to seeing Dr. Now. I don't know how much help they could of given him. We don't know what happened behind the scenes, but I would like to think they would not exploit a man who made them aware of his depression could be responsible.  So whatever comes out poor l.b. bonner just couldn't deal with life. May that poor man rest in peace.üíî"

depression,fj1qg9i,t3_farc3n,1582925526.0,"Yes, I have been feeling like that lately. I suffer from bipolar, severe depression with psychotic disorder along with OCD. I'm constantly pondering death & wonder why my life turned out the way it did. You are not alone. I love this forum because I have been able to purge on days that are rough like you are experiencing.  Knowing there are ones that can relate to how we feel helps me. Comments that I receive of understanding makes me feel like I'm not alone. I have also utelized the suicide hotline to hear a person. Somethings in my head I just can't tell anyone, not even my psychiatrist. I just need to hear a voice, it just helps me when I say my sorrow to someone I don't know & they don't know me or anyone I know. But I'm having a decent day & I want to tell you I understand. If you can take a walk in the park & look at the beauty it helps. I know that the hardest thing is to walk out the door. Sometimes I get teary at the thought of walking out the door, but I feel a little better when I do.  I've been 5150 2 times in the last 3 years. I gained alot of tools to keep my mind busy. Thinking of you with thoughts & prayers, we are not alone.‚ù§"

Marriage takes work and I believe he really was trying. I was really annoyed when she made dinner and I thought how sweet, but they get to the table he thanks her, he's happy & probably hopeful. Then rather then chat with Brandon & she goes onto social media so I think that she only got on the show to get more Instagram followers.

She just is fake and I think that Instagram post was utterly disrespectful and I'm over her. I hope Brandon finds a nice girl that brings the best out the best not the worst."

I would never think this, but I think for the mental safety of the family, she may have to be in a convesalent home. Oh gosh, she is just saying she swollen & water weight!  She'd be way under if she wasn't so swollen.  I'm watching right now. Dr. Now just laid the law  therapy or no more help. Gosh, every single thing is NEGATIVE. Her poor family.

It was on IG, they had a former immigration person giving input on why Michael got denied, what happens if Mursel goes back to Turkey. That was the first I got. 

So they are better off staying with a horror show like Tania, getting his crap together & then finding a wonderful kind flower child that is as layed back as he is."
90DayFiance,fe9q8hy,t1_fe94ekw,1578940481.0,My husband would never tolerate that. He'd leave me. Tania has no clue that in a relationship one cannot be in full control. Its giving 100% of yourself & recieving 100% from your partner. She is a soul crusher. She will always end up alone as longer as her armpit smelling self does not change.

realhousewives,fe9mxro,t3_eo51f4,1578939559.0,"I'd rather watch her then the 3 witches of the OC.  I mean if they bring Vicki back after her outrageous antics yelling how it's her show, telling Braunwyn to get off her show doesn't get her fired, she will be even pushier with her self righteous self & really think she is not only the OG of the OC, but she will feel like her threats worked & she will be more demanding & outrageous.  I seriously don't understand any of the men that date Vicki & Shannon with those screeches & bad behavior.  Seriously don't understand how Eddie is ok with Tamra getting naked & filthy drunk. I mean how do you look his parents in the eye? I mean no self respect.  I'm no prude & I can see if it happens a couple of times, but Tamra is so self absorbed in her looks she takes any opportunity to get naked. She's a bully. I think Braunwyn deserves a season 2 because we can see if she can bring more to the show, AND to my glee would piss off Vicki soooo bad!"
AskReddit,fdigb2d,t3_cttf20,1578442251.0,"Well I'm not proud of this but I was in my twenties working at a company small company you know less than 15 employees and the office manager would drive you crazy with her mood swings.  She was the type of you got on her crap list she would flip her middle finger when you walked by. Ya, she was a gem.

Anyway, I had enough of her. She was making my last day working there hell. So, myself & 5 others used to have lunch at noon. We had a couch, conference room table & kitchen. So we watched our soap operas. I was making lunch complaining with the others, so when I was washing my dishes a plan formed in my head.

I opened the silverware drawer & licked 10 of each utensils. About 45ish total. We did not like the 1:00 o'clock brown noses snitches so they were all gonna pay!!

Well the rest of the day went wonderfully even though she was trying to push my buttons I changed up & smiled at her. Ahhh, the sweet revenge knowing they would be eating off the silverware I licked!  Now I'm a grown up, but I never forgot that & would never do that again. No matter how angry I get. I work at a lovely company near my home & have been there for 29 years."

Watching their story unfold shows that they both have become better people. So I'll be waiting for my down arrow.  Have a lovely even to you all."
