I don't know your motivation for posting here, but i just saw a wall to wall of hatred. I understand why boogie isn't popular. He is a manipulative narcissist, but i really feel that calling him a ""land whale"" and a paedophile is going too far.

I have since had a jackass pm me saying that I am a paedophile myself, which only reinforces my initial opinion that many people in this sub are pieces of s***.

I don't think piling on boogie makes anyone virtuous. I think many ppl on this sub are posting simply to claim some kind of moral high ground so they can feel superior in some way.

So I decided against joining in the pile on with this meme, and called you out on it.

I do not like Boogie, I think most of the criticism here of him is accurate, it's just the nasty, unnecessary stuff that I object to.

I'll ask you why you made this meme? What did you hope to achieve with it?

And rest assured I have deleted this subreddit from my favourites. I'm not going to waste much more time getting involved here, and will not be replying to any other threads.
