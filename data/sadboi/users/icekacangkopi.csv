Reading your post reminded me of my dad. He could not buy me things so the next best thing he did was take me to see people in hope of ""curing"" my depression. I appreaciate what he did. Looking back now with him growing older, my source of support feels like its drifting away."

Props on getting things done at such a young age! I am impressed. Enjoy that laptop! It was exactly 10 years ago around your age where I got my first acer laptop for school. The powerful legendary 3820TG acer. When it was release it was the only laptop that is 13 inch size that can beat 15 inch laptops. Hell it was more powerful than my core 2 duo deskstop with Nvidia 8600GT.

depression,fmy0xqw,t3_fy1mcn,1586475806.0,I had same thing on lexapro. It makes me feel less inhibited in suicidal thoughts. A simple thing like looking out the window give me thought of climbing out. The scary thing is I felt like I could do it and the lethargy of depression is massively suppressed with the meds I ended up stopping the meds overtime. You can try tallkng with your doctor to try something else.

SuicideWatch,fmqfqqy,t3_fwtj33,1586298750.0,"I am a decade older than you but I still have anxiety with people and awkward. Even now I am still thinking of my ""wasted"" youth. Wasted as in I could have done better in studies as I never did went to a University. Even now I am insecure about my height and body. You are not alone. I realised that I would feel time is wasted is in way because it is the same thought I have a few years ago vs now. I am sure 10 years forward I would ask myself what I have wasted today.

I wanna tell you that you never really missed out on anything if the things you wanted to do in your teen are unhealthy stuff. Sure you can recover faster as you aee in your youth but it would still affect you down the line. Sure you missed experiences but some experiences are unnessary to experience if you can learn it from someone to make a change. Example smoking may seem fun but the getting off it is hard.

Its all normal to awkward at your age. You are still growing."

It really sucks to feel that. I really feel inadequate for wasting my years and being old seeing ppl much younger than me. It depends on how you look most likely they don't know your age until you tell your mates or them looking at your ic. I look younger than my age so I blended in with younger people. The worse part is getting ""bullied"" by the ""seniors"" younger than you. It would be awhile before you are senior there. Before that you just have to tahan until they are gone. Still from my experience it just sucks, it highly depend where you are posted. I do meet ppl of similar age to me at other branches."
