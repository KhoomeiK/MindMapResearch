AskReddit,fpcq3nf,t3_gcna0k,1588509443.0,"I went from being completely comfortable around girls in elementary and into middle school, then I hit puberty, went to high school and it all changed. I was bullied for a bit, didn't have any friends or confidence in my ability to even talk to girls and that stretched into my early twenties.

The difference between me and current ""incels,"" in my honest opinion is the internet and social media. I'm old enough to have went to school before social media really existed. My high school days predate Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. So I didn't have access to all these pages where I could get stuck in an echo chamber and hate on women, be even more miserable and all that. There's a mob mentality in social media that sucks in a bunch of people who find similarities between them and strangers and those similarities are used for nefarious purposes like spreading sexism, playing the victim, and being violently angry. I was also around people who routinely told me, ""there's plenty of fish in the sea."" 

I too had a lot of anger. I crushed hard on certain girls in high school, and I was so damn bitter about being robbed of the typical high school experience it affected my sanity. I kind of feel this demented kinship with incels because of my experiences 20 years ago, but sticking yourself in an echo chamber and refusing to do any self inventory will do irreparable harm.  

I do shutter to think where I'd be if Facebook, Twitter and all these sites existed in high school."

To answer your question,  I was once into politics, and asked for My Life by Bill Clinton for Christmas, and despite it being 900 pages, I went through it in just a couple of weeks. He wrote it in a way where it seemed like I was in a room with him sipping on scotch, as he told me a bunch of stories. I then started reading a bunch of political books, biographies, then moved on to true crime, and now fiction. I don't know if I just read terrible books in school, or if I clued in late on the majestic beauty of a great book, but now, in my spare time I try to read one book a month.
