TwoXChromosomes,fef0bhz,t3_eooy28,1579045189.0,"My last two exes really sapped all my self esteem because they would always interrupt me, or not listen, and only ever want to talk about themselves and what they were interested in. It makes you feel really small and worthless, like nothing you say has any value and that you’re boring. I would always ask my boyfriends about their opinions on things like films, music or politics, and how was his day etc and then I would listen to what he had to say because I was genuinely interested in what he thought and his experiences. But this was never reciprocated, not that I think conversation should always be ‘I listened to you know you listen to me’ but I don’t get being in a relationship with someone and just not caring about what they have to say. Even when it was subjects I wasn’t interested in, I would listen and ask questions because it’s something that is important to them and I loved them. It comes off really uncaring. Also both my exes were real top mansplainers, one would always interrupt me (often mid sentence) and either straight up change the topic to something he was interested in or go on a massive lecture about a topic that I was talking about and not let me speak. And an incredible moment with the other guy was where he started talking about sexism in the work place and how difficult it is for women, I started speaking to add my contribution to the subject and he just talked over me. I actually had to laugh it was so ridiculous. 
I know this isn’t obviously something that all men do, but I have so many friends tell me about how their boyfriends have real trouble engaging in normal conversation, and just don’t give a damn about what the girls has to say."
