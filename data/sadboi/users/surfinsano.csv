depression,fkq1ghl,t1_fkpuq3d,1584426634.0,"I used to love myself. Now my self hatred is more than I can manage. I loved trying to make friends, but now I’m too bitter, angry, and non-trusting for anybody to get close. I loved the journey of a relationship, but same as above. I loved a night out with a gf and just feeling free. I loved going to church. I loved having a best friend (or any friend)."
sad,fkq142x,t3_fjvyf5,1584426241.0,This seriously feels like my freaking life.
depression,fkp4i9l,t1_fkn6sao,1584401604.0,I wish it was. I’ve been hearing it so long that it’s a comfort now.
depression,fkp4fyh,t1_fkn2vdj,1584401562.0,I was hoping writing it down would help but it really hasn’t. I’m still in the same mindset.
depression,fkmwi2u,t3_fj8mva,1584342830.0,"If I had friends yes they would. But the best I have is acquaintances or co-workers. Obviously those who I have called my friends in the past have gone on without me and haven’t had a single thigh about me since we’ve split apart, whatever the reason."
depression,fj6ln13,t3_fbtpus,1583075000.0,I read a full page of self depreciating things to myself every day. And I self harm. Haven’t been able to put it into words though.
depression,fiiw3jd,t1_fihiuld,1582428365.0,It’s only going to get worse. I understand the urge and everything. Please get some help before it gets worse for you.
depression,fif8ltv,t3_f7tpt0,1582386921.0,"I’ve done this for years. I continue to do it, but I want to try and talk you out of making it a habit. It’s gotten that bad for me. Please try to find a different way to cope. I do it so much now that I’ll find an object or a wall and punch/hit myself until I get blood out of my head or I’m so dazed that I can’t stand and se stars. Please don’t let it get tat bad because I’m sure it’s causing long term damage but now I can’t stop. Other suggestions are rubber bands or palms together. Please try those."
depression,fi74m64,t3_f6rt5o,1582214186.0,I read all of that and it brought a tear to my eye. I’m glad you’re alive and hope things have continued to improve. Thank you for sharing your story.
SuicideWatch,fglef8d,t3_ez5uks,1580893482.0,I just have a general note. Mainly because I hate myself too much and have no friends. I keep it in case my impulse finally takes over/my rage fit goes up a notch.
depression,fgknw2w,t3_eyv98p,1580869796.0,I’m afraid of change. I’d rather continually beat myself than go get help because I don’t know any other way. Getting help scares me because I’ve been this way for so long. Also it’ll end my job and I’m too stupid to try to find another one.
depression,ffajmy1,t3_esgot1,1579737377.0,"For me it’s a combination of self-hatred, impulse, and release. It’s gotten to the point where it feels natural, and lately it’s not successful until I bleed. I’ll use anything I can find when I’m in my rage and I’ll beat myself (usually head) until I bleed or I get so dazed that I’m satisfied. Once I’m done, I have a combination of relief and anger. Usually more relief."
depression,fdceq2d,t3_ekeedb,1578273084.0,"Me. I’ve tried but I’ve given up. Lately I’ve isolated myself from even friends. Now the best I have would be buds. No friends, no best friend (don’t even know what that is), and isolation is my life. And the whole thing of “get out there, try, do something” I don’t have energy for it. Just flat out don’t and I’m in my 30s. I just don’t wan to try anymore."
Anxiety,fc6b5mx,t3_egd1qj,1577476479.0,Nope. It’ll send me into a self-harm rage a lot. Some of those come from 20 years ago.
depression,fbc4hxy,t3_ecdwk4,1576715455.0,Anytime I told people I was having a hard time or a depression episode...silence. Then they want to restart things like nothing happened. Had a g/f leave me then a friend decided to pull the above move. Now I’m alone. I’ve shut out the rest of people and after Christmas is over my family is next. Gotta keep the smiling face for the holidays. Afterwards it’s game off. Maybe for good.
Anxiety,f9sgaq0,t3_e6n1em,1575591851.0,Same. I can’t take care of myself so how can I take care of somebody that has no clue what to do. Between anxiety and depression I’d be a huge mess (well I am already) but even worse if I had kids.
SuicideWatch,f8n9k18,t1_f8n7tt2,1574640777.0,See you there.
SuicideWatch,f8mskk2,t1_f8m75m6,1574634641.0,Shut up.
Anxiety,f6v7cfr,t3_dt6hu2,1573178541.0,"I can’t forgive myself for events 20+ years ago. And those memories will all come in waves, typically when I’m on an upswing. Then back to the isolated depressed pits."
SuicideWatch,f6v5yu9,t3_dt2gex,1573177513.0,Hear that. I want to talk to people and not regret it for hours afterwards. I want to tell somebody I bash my head continuously but then I’ll get locked up. I want to not chase people away. But I’m wrong to want all of these things and I’ll remain isolated.
depression,f5z45xz,t3_dpvf4g,1572566663.0,Shut the lights off and watch movies on my phone so nobody comes to my door. Just like every other night.
SuicideWatch,f4i3sa7,t3_dkfkaq,1571599725.0,It will be how I go. I’ve done so many notes that now I just have a all-purpose one that will be easy to find.
ForeverAlone,f3ub29w,t3_di41s4,1571156591.0,Well glad I’m in my 30s and still/will be FA.
depression,f31t3ma,t3_dezigp,1570584066.0,"I’ll blow my lid off because an ad on my phone is not letting me close it 1 second after it’s over. I’ll proceed with a head punching session and then do the same thing again. And again. And again. And as far as people go, I hate people. I’ve chased one friend away lately and told another I’m having a depression episode and nothing. Once I come home I just want to sleep. I used to be able to function on 7. Now it has to be 8 and I won’t roll out of bed in the morning. Just hate everything."
depression,eu9zhgc,t3_cfb5vl,1563595640.0,"Yep. Regularly. Drawn blood out of my head twice lately. It’s gone from my fists to anything nearby. Phone case, folded knife, anything close by. Yea it hurts afterwards but I don’t know if/how to stop doing it. Anxiety, depression episodes, or something isn’t going right that’s truly out for my control all can start a session up."
depression,etsk068,t3_cd6d58,1563147631.0,"Usually 3-4 days. And no clue what triggers it. I’ll wake up feeling motivated and happy, each day it decreases slightly until day 3 or 4 and I crash. Hard. The crappy feeling/depression lasts a lot longer."
SuicideWatch,esu0njl,t1_esth7gl,1562276155.0,Nope. Just still don’t have methods. It’ll be a couple weeks before I can. Which I think is driving me even more crazy.
depression,esrv6ic,t3_c8x5y2,1562237689.0,Yes. Plan is there and a note is in place. All I need is one more good mental breakdown (near my home) and I’ll walk to the tracks and put my neck on one side and the train will take care of me.
SuicideWatch,esgyvmm,t3_c7p5id,1561974357.0,"Yep. I stated with smacking and now I’ve progressed to full fist to my head and grabbing hard objects to hit myself, twice drawing blood in the past month. It’s been so bad today that despite a monster headache and both of my hands hurting, I’ve still been doing it. I hear ya on this one."
SuicideWatch,esgyos8,t1_esgqvts,1561974065.0,Yep. Even a hurt hand and a massive headache I keep doing it. It is an impulse.
SuicideWatch,esgyo02,t1_esgjcfb,1561974030.0,"Hitting yourself led to to the hospital? I’ve read about head injuries from this (and of course I just had another session of it, so it obviously doesn’t bother me). Because I’m in a field where anything related to medical is added to my work record. That’s about all I can say (sorry)."
depression,esaoi3w,t3_c6l8br,1561764508.0,My weakness is that I’m gullible and can’t tell when people are joking. As a result I catch all the comments and am constantly the butt of all the jokes. I don’t even try the friend thing. The worst offenders are people around me that I work with that really don’t know me a all. Can’t stand people.
