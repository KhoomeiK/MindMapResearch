AmItheAsshole,fiqfifa,t1_fiqcc8t,1582643166.0,The problem is if she posted it she wouldn’t say I’ve told the baby I wish it hadn’t been born to it’s face. There’s not adjusting (which I understand bevause I’ve been the sister in a similar situation) then there’s being mean
AmItheAsshole,fiqfbf5,t1_fiqdkxw,1582643039.0,I like this idea
AmItheAsshole,fiqfarp,t1_fipr9fo,1582643027.0,"So I’m going to respectfully disagree, you do make good points but I take his side and I was the aunt in the situation my sister brother in law and nephew moved in with us then got pregnant. And while I never asked for her to be born I don’t wish she hadn’t. I love her with all my heart and it was tough when she’d cry it when I’d hear screaming downstairs, buf also his sisters point is family takes care of family that applied to my situation I don’t think she really means it when she says it."
AmItheAsshole,fiqezvh,t1_fiq3liw,1582642830.0,"Well less important events like sleeping from what he said in his post, you need sleep to function at a job and be a good parent in general.

That’s extreme, I do agree with you when you said her comments are unwarranted but she got mad when he didn’t ask her, but I do agree with your need more info comment."

dating_advice,fgobhgw,t3_ezknhv,1580964716.0,So I agree with an earlier comment about how she might be nervous and not sure if you actually want a relationship (that’s happened to me) But also like I’ll talk to a guy and (I’m 19F) and it’ll be great and we’ll meet in person and it’s just not there. The physical part isn’t there and even the emotional part like we could have a great date but I’m just not feeling it. Which sucks because I’ve met a lot of great guys just not for me? Does that make sense?
IWantToLearn,fg5wjg5,t1_fg5whnm,1580541885.0,You could also see a therapist? I know they can help with that. And figuring out different things like why they are upset and you are not. Best of luck!
IWantToLearn,fg5unk6,t3_ewz068,1580539576.0,"So put yourself in different scenarios. If that happened to me how would I feel? But I’m
Not sure if that’s empathy or sympathy. I think empathy is where you empathize because you went through a similar or same situation. Sympathy I think is where like for example your friends mom has been diagnosed with cancer, and you feel bad and sympathize because you know it can be rough even if you haven’t gone through it yourself. Does that make sense? Also feel free to correct me if I got it backwards. My friend said something funny the other day, she said “when I say I’m sorry to someone when something bad happens and they say it’s not your fault , I get annoyed like I know it’s my not my fault but I still have sympathy for you” she went on a rant and yeah hope that helps!"

I felt weird because I felt the pressure on my vagina. We had talked about what we wanted and I said I need that connection. He agreed. I understand you’ve had shit that’s gone down but so have I.

AmItheAsshole,f7xk24w,t1_f7xdwbb,1574060814.0,The thing is if you look at his comments he hasn’t said I don’t want to be a dad. That would be different in an earlier comment I’m pretty sure he said he was going to be involved. So really if he doesn’t want to be a dad then he doesn’t have to be but he’s throwing a fit because his fiancé wasn’t making him a priority and focusing on the baby. If he doesn’t want to be involved that’s fine but he also needs to respect that his family wants to know the baby.
AmItheAsshole,f7xjx4m,t1_f7xiw7a,1574060639.0,This. Like if you don’t want to be a dad that’s your choice but it’s also your family’s choice to be involved. If you want to be involved then stop your little hissy fit. But the above comment sums it up perfectly

relationship_advice,f38r0kb,t3_dg0v1e,1570739068.0,"I am so sorry what they did was rape. If you see her again apologize and say that you need a little time but do like her. Boys can be raped as well and it doesn’t matter wether you came or not. When I was younger I had something similar happen and I didn’t get help for years. Do you feel comfortable talking to your parents? Or the counselor or the police? I was worried for the longest time that I was gay because of what happened. What happened doesn’t make you gay. Even if you were/are that would make no difference to what happened. I saw a lot of other comments posting links to sites. It is not your fault!! Let me repeat IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT!! It takes time to heal and you can still try to salvage your friendship. I’m 19 and a female and what happened to me was different but the feelings were still there. The most important thing to remember is this is not your fault. You in no way brought this upon yourself. I have been in therapy since I was in 7th grade (different reasons) and the past couple years is when I really started to open up. I wish you the best of luck healing. I urge you to talk to someone wether it’s a therapist or a family member! I would really tell your dad or step sibling or parental figure though. That most certainly does not happen at sleepovers.  It also sounds like you might’ve been drugged. Take it from someone who internalized the feelings it’s much better. Also if you really don’t wanna tell your parents why, you can say that it’s teenage stuff you don’t wanna talk with your parents about. You shouldn’t feel ashamed or embarrassed. However I don’t want you think that I’m saying your feelings aren’t validated because they are. Everything you are feeling is validated. You most certainly are not damaged! It takes time, your also not broken, there are tons of websites and support groups with people who feel just like you. What they did was wrong and even if they aren’t classified as adults they can still get in trouble and you can get a restraining order. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out!"
