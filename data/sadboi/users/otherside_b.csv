Caiaphas: the Jewish high priest who, according to the gospels, organized a plot to kill Jesus. He famously presided over the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. 

Draco:  the first recorded legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece. He replaced the prevailing system of oral law and blood feud by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law. 

Trimalcion:  **Trimalcion** or **Trimalchion** is a fictional character from the *Satyricon* , a novel attributed to the Latin author Petronius . He became a slave to a wealthy emancipated because his master gave him his freedom, his money and his place as a senator before his   
death.

Tiberius:  Tiberius was the second Roman emperor, reigning from AD 14 to AD 37.  He was a very capable military leader and a sensible civic leader who tried to restrain Rome's out-of-control budget. But he was also dour and unpopular."

It reads like he is gatekeeping philosophy, ignoring those who he doesn't agree with and promoting those who he does. It's a bit hypocritical in my opinion. He just argued that convents were outdated and are not relevant to the modern world. Now he is rejecting some newer schools of philosophy because he doesn't agree with their opinions.

I also like the last line, even if it is a little over dramatic

>Waterloo is not a battle; it is the change of front of the universe."

AYearOfLesMiserables,fkursr1,t1_fkui289,1584554944.0,"Yup ditto, letting it all wash over me. We get similar details about Napoleon mentioned in War and Peace with the weird ear pulling thing that he was said to do.

Now I'm wondering how many novels Napoleon appears in as a character.

Also Hugo forgot to use a full stop for a second there. I though one sentence was never going to end."
AYearOfLesMiserables,fkpckjp,t1_fkp91sb,1584406910.0,"Sounds like you have a lot more important stuff going on right now than reading along with us!

The sub will still be here in a few months if you are able to catch up. Take care of yourself and your daughter!"
AYearOfLesMiserables,fkoe1jr,t3_fjgfl3,1584385343.0,"Thanks for the footnotes, my version doesn't have many. Usually I don't miss the footnotes but given the current situation with COVID-19 extra reading is needed!

Here in Ireland we seem to be pretty proactive. My University has closed, no classes and the buildings are all shut. Unfortunately the situation has potentially scuppered a work placement I was due to start at the end of April.

Pretty much all events are cancelled and all bars are closed. I have plenty of assignments and stuff to do so I'm keeping busy. If this hit last year I would have been working in a supermarket which seems like my idea of hell about now, so I'm thankful of that at least."

AYearOfLesMiserables,fkkbkea,t3_fiy3sl,1584279717.0,"It does feel like a massive tangent that has nothing to do with the story. I enjoy looking up the words that I don't know about military stuff though, usually uniforms. Like today with *Shakos*, which means the big hats with plumes coming out of them that armies used to wear.

I feel that the number of comments will naturally go down, just because people don't know what to make of these Waterloo chapters."
AYearOfLesMiserables,fkehbob,t1_fkd19w3,1584113187.0,"I take that to mean that he is presenting the story and mythology of Waterloo, rather than an accurate historical account."
AYearOfLesMiserables,fkeh5yk,t3_fhrar9,1584113094.0,"I don't really know anything about the history of Waterloo, but going by the links that were posted in the previous thread Hugo's description of the battle is historically inaccurate. Now is this purposeful or is he just making a mistake and presenting what he believes is a truthful account, I don't really know.

Take it with a grain of salt."

AYearOfLesMiserables,fk5mpt8,t3_fg5mso,1583883678.0,"1. Nope not surprised. This was set up back when Valjean first became mayor, when the town gossips were trash-talking him amongst themselves.
2. How is it he failed to escape the galleys several times, but escapes the local prison immediately? Different levels of prisons obviously but still LOL.
3. Go on you rebel you! Love it!
4. Brilliant! Excited to see where we go from here!"
AYearOfLesMiserables,fk05opd,t3_ffnktf,1583743038.0,"Rip Fantine! I think we all knew she would die, but this is a particularly painful way to go, her soul crushed by Javert.

I think we see a new cruel side of Javert here. It's clear now he's not just blind to the inconsistencies of the law, which is forgivable for me, he is also power hungry. He wants to be called by his title and wants everyone to raise their voice when he is around. A power hungry police officer is a scary thought.

Valjean surrendering is not really a surprise, with Fantine dying any reason for resistance is gone. Also, he'd pretty much resigned himself to the galleys after outing himself in the courtroom."

AYearOfLesMiserables,fjr9ku6,t3_fegyds,1583583050.0,"It seems like Fantine is going to die pretty soon, the question is whether she will see Cosette before she passes.

Something that hasnt been commented on yet, what's the deal with the white hair? It instantaneously changed from grey to white during the trial. This novel clearly cannot be classified as a realist one, which is interesting because the subject matter actually lends itself quite well to that approach.

I can't figure out a genre to put this novel into, it seems to be in a category all of itself."
AYearOfLesMiserables,fjnvzd6,t1_fjnokvf,1583515433.0,"I accept Valjean and his amazingness, its Champmathieu and his portrayal as a sort of sub human that disturbs me a bit.

I also accept that to be disturbed by the animalistic depiction of Champmathieu is probably the point. This is the type of person this society produces."
AYearOfLesMiserables,fjl41am,t3_fdzxhb,1583439511.0,"I love the fact that Madeleine was just able to part the crowds and walk out after admitting to his crimes. Drops Mic. Walks Out. Totally bad ass.

What do you guys think of the final line? Is he saying Champmathieu is too dumb to realise that Valjean/Madeleine has just saved him? Is he saying all peasants are dumb or just Champmathieu? If Valjean can become a learned man, why not this guy?"
AYearOfLesMiserables,fjl3dy3,t1_fjkvkxc,1583439155.0,"The theatricality is something I have commented on in previous chapters. It makes me want to see the theatrical musical at some point.

I agree that the last few weeks have been page turners, it's an exciting read right now."
AYearOfLesMiserables,fjideo7,t3_fdg1mz,1583365231.0,"The laughter at Champmathieu after he told his story is infuriating. He pours his heart out to the court, tells of the hardship's he has had to endure, and these guys who enjoy a life of privilege response is laughter?

I was pissed after reading it tbh. It took me a few minutes to calm down!"
