This is my Day 4 + 5 update. If you just want to skip to my questions that I need help with, you can jump to the end of the post!

**Background**

I have been posting this Easter week about my steep learning curve to getting my pool up and running. Due to corona here in Central Europe, we are in complete lockdown. All good so far with the pool. But some potentially big worries today on day 5.

**Background for Day 4 + 5**

If you‚Äôre been following these posts, you‚Äôll know that by Day 3 the pool was crystal clear. I learned how to do everything for the first time - cleaning filter, vacuuming, backwashing, rinsing etc etc. I shocked the pool 3 days in a row and left the filter running 24/7. The pool looks fantastic. The only issue is that the ph is still low. I have ph+ in my garage, but I don‚Äôt want to use it yet. I only have a couple of liters (or maybe only 1 liter) and I want to keep it for when we can use the pool in a couple of weeks. As I say, we are in lockdown and can‚Äôt get to any pool shops (I haven‚Äôt been out for over 4 weeks now!)

So, pool is great. But there are issues. 

**Day 4 + 5 issues**

I didn‚Äôt post an update for Day 4 as it was stormy and raining and I didn‚Äôt do much. It started raining in the morning and I turned off the filter. It has been on for 24 hours and when I turned it off it made a huge spluttering noise and water shot out of the skimmer!!! 

Stupidly I didn‚Äôt think much of it. One of the chlorine bhoys was stuck to the skimmer tube, so I thought it was just because of that.

But it‚Äôs air in the system!!!

**Day 5**

It was a beautifully bright morning today so I turned on the filter again after waking up. The noises!!!! I turned it off immediately and air shot out of the skimmer and the jets again. I shit myself. 

I looking at the filter system and **there was no water in the basket!!** i opened the lid slightly and air came out and water started to fill in the basket. Phew.

But I knew it was airlocked, so I googled and found out how to bleed a sand filter. I bled it (air came out for a good 90 seconds) until water came out. Great. Filter basket still full of water too.

I decided to add some water into the pool. To my (untrained) eye, the water level was above the skimmer tube, but I guess air had been entering. So I added water.

I was brave and decided to turn on the filter system again. Everything seemed to be going ok. The only thing noticeable is that the jets weren‚Äôt as strong. 

But I noticed one big issue: the skimmer tube wasn‚Äôt sucking in any water!

**These issues today have spooked me and I‚Äôve lost all confidence.**

I have included a photo of the valves in case I am doing something wrong. 

**Questions**

1. Why would the skimmer tube not be sucking water? Is it blocked? Or could I have busted it with the air? Should I backwash it and see if that helps?

2. Can you get air in by running a filter 24/7 for days? I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong. I guess the water level was too low at some point?

3. The valve picture. Does anyone know what each one is? The red handle on the far left says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch‚Äù. And the red on the floor is always closed. Why would it be closed? I guess the blue is the skimmer? I normally close the blue and the red on the right when I what to open the filter basket to clean it.

So, this is day 3. If you‚Äôve followed my previous posts, you‚Äôll see that because of corona here in Europe, I have had to learn to look after my pool. 

And I think on day 3 it looks pretty good. 

**Day 3**

Yesterday evening I shocked it again and also put in algaecide as I thought the walls looked green still even after the brushing. There was a lot of foam on top after adding the algaecide. I left the filter on overnight.

This morning, the pool was clearer as you can see in the photo above. 

I was happy to see very little sediment and dust on the pool floor at the deep end. I vacuumed this to waste and added more water. I backwashed and rinsed.

The pool is now sitting with the filter off. I will put it on for 4 hours this evening, aiming for 8 hours per day moving forward into general maintenance.

**Day 3 issues**

My main concerns now are these:

1. The ph is quite low: 6.2. I have ph+. Is it just a matter of adding this?
2. Do I need to still shock the pool? I don‚Äôt think so but I‚Äôm not sure. The chlorine level was 10ppm last night before bed and 3ppm at midday today
3. Do I need more algaecide? I read it affects the chlorine?
4. I have floculante. Should I add it this evening for overnight filtering?
5. The alkalinity is still low. 40ppm.

Any advice regarding these issues is much appreciated! All the comments the last couple of days have been a great help. Cheers.

**Evening report**

At 20.00, the chlorine level is still 3ppm but the ph is now 5.8.

I have decided the shock the pool again tonight and see if that will help the ph.

I have also removed the chlorine buoys with the tablets as I‚Äôve read that they can lower alkalinity and ph?

I am concerned about the low ph level as I have very little ph+ and can‚Äôt leave home to get any more due to the European lockdown."

Due to corona, I have to look after the pool myself for the first time. It has been a steep learning curve.

Yesterday evening I shocked the pool, adding approx 450g of granulated chlorine to the 14000 gallons. Left the filter on over night. It has been on for 24 hours.

The color is much better. You can see the bottom of the pool in all parts of the pool.

I vacuumed the very little algae dust that had settled in the deep end. 

The ph level is 7.2 and the chlorine level is better.

pools,fmhvmnr,t3_fvdx6m,1586094906.0,"Hi!

**Background**

With the corona situation, I‚Äôm having to work out my pool for the first time. I‚Äôm just wondering what my next steps are.

Info:
- 29.5ft x 15ft

- 9m x 4.5m

- Volume of pool: 14500 gallons

Ph level 7.0
Ch level 0
Alkalinity: low 

I only have a crap strip tester and the little drops thingy.

The photo above is not perfect. It‚Äôs not really as green as it appears above. There is a slight tinge more than anything. In the shallow end beside the jets you can see the floor clearly though it is a little cloudy, but it is certainly cloudier and a little greener in the deep end.

**What I‚Äôve done**

These were my steps (all of which I learned myself after a weeks worth of YouTube videos and building up my confidence in r/pool! üòÖ):

1. I had the filter on all week intermittently. Pool was very green with algae on floor. I cleaned the filter, backwashed, rinsed, and then vacuumed to waste while running hose to maintain level. All sediment and algae and leaves etc on floor are gone. 
2. Did Ph test. 6.8. Added ph+ (400g) with filter on. Left for 4 hours.
3. Foam started to appear on top of water?
4. Did ph test. Still 6.8ish. 
5. Next day: did ph test: 7.0-7.2.
6. Floor looked green in places. vacuumed with filter?
7. Added 200g of ph+.
8. Filter on now for 3 hours so far.

So, this is all probably very amateur. But there is no sediment on floor. The water is slightly cloudy in places and the floor and walls seem a little green in places. But it is better than a couple of days ago.

**Next steps**

So, what do I do next?

I have granulated chlorine, algaecide, and floculante.

I don‚Äôt know which I need to use?

Clearly I need to bring the chlorine way up, but I read that the ph level needs to be good first? Then I read that liquid chlorine naturally brings the ph level up?

These are the only products that I have (I also have chlorine pucks and ph-) but I can‚Äôt go to a store to get more as I am in Central Europe and we are in complete lockdown.
