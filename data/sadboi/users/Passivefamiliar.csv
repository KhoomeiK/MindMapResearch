Tldr: any suggestions of companies? I'm bogged down and overworked.  Have no idea where to try.  PM me,  anyone.  I'd like to be successful and happy.  Walmart pays decent,  but I rarely see my family unless I take vacation, which I'm still hounded during."

Then we did it,  guess who got to lead that one.. we had meetings and everything for,  maybe a week.  Then I wasn't a newbie anymore and shit hit the fan.  I never get my job done,  even when I do something's wrong somewhere.  To many call offs,  numbers literally don't match the expectations but that's my problem,  gotta figure out a plan to makeup 35 hours of freight stocking. 

With the Rona I can't even fire people.  Having one guy leave every day a few hours early.  But... nothing to it we need the bodies.  Literally hired 2 people who stole from the store before,  but staffing is so low nobody cares.  People come and go as they please.. schedule is pointless right now.  Closing the store at 830 is great but it takes an hour to wrangle the crack addicts and the Karen's out.. lost productivity there but again that's my problem. 

There's nothing in the back goddamn it.  Except two entire pallets of bleach.  2 pallets of beans and fruit.  And cereal.  With nowhere to put it.  Legit built 2 endcaps of bleach. Even put cups next to them in the action alley. That was the highlight of my week.
