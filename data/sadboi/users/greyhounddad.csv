whatcarshouldIbuy,fmdkyb6,t3_fufihk,1585970506.0,No. Never again. I had a black Volvo C30 and I hated it. The car being black did not help any. I have had only colors with better resale value such as white and silver.
AskGaybrosOver30,fma5svl,t3_ftpxfs,1585884561.0,"I really struggled with 30. Emotionally and spiritually.

40 was much better.

21 was the best."
AskGaybrosOver30,fma5lcf,t3_ftylhe,1585884407.0,"I got a BA just after hs with a miserable gpa due to fun, work, not going to class, drinking, fraternity, etc. I decided to go back and get a masters degree in my 30s. It applied to what I was doing in life which was working for a nonprofit. I decided to get a bachelors degree in nursing about 10 years later, and I went back to school for the wrong reasons (money, thinking I would change the world, etc) and not having career experience. I graduated with the degree but never found a fit and ended up leaving the field in 2015. I still have the three degrees. But none are particularly useful today given my career path. So if you choose to do it, think long and hard of what you want to do long term and how it will benefit you. I know from my masters program that program heads were saying it depended on what you wanted to do on a MBA and where you to school at would be beneficial. I was given the best advice by my uncle a long time ago who said go the best named college you can get into. It will carry you further."

gaybrosgonemild,fm6pm0p,t3_ftaujv,1585799779.0,I understand about the rough day. But the shaved head looks great on you!
gaybrosgonemild,fm6pdyv,t3_ft7wo0,1585799614.0,Nice!
lolgrindr,fm13zru,t1_fm139e8,1585671578.0,So sorry if offended.
lolgrindr,fm123rb,t1_flzksso,1585670577.0,The fact that you used the word “minorities” is telling of white privilege.
gaybrosgonemild,flziofg,t3_frxllk,1585624607.0,Hot AF.
AskGayMen,flsdt0o,t3_fqutu2,1585439895.0,"Basing your self worth on apps is really painful. Apps show the worst of people. Games, ghosting, married guys, etc. If you can look at them for what they are—a modern gay bar/cruise place. If you are going there to meet friends and make connections then this not the place. If you are looking to hookup, then know that being 19 unfortunately there are people who may hit you up simply because of your age and expect you to look a certain way. It doesn’t mean that look that way or not. I’m believe you that are a cute guy. But those hitting you up may see 19 and be like that. So cut yourself some slack. I’m sure guys on here have good advice as well too."
askgaybros,flpoizk,t3_fq9cr0,1585364562.0, Congratulations!
askgaybros,flpoaxc,t3_fpzsb1,1585364398.0,Omg. Seriously?
AskGaybrosOver30,flo5y00,t1_flmclv7,1585332214.0,Wow that is terrible. Sounds like I shouldn’t be complaining. I get the as life was getting better thing. It is the same for me.
AskGaybrosOver30,flo4zf7,t1_flmwnr9,1585331710.0,Thank you for the link! That was so helpful. And it was from a reputable source too.
GayRateMe,flm24mf,t3_fpg44k,1585272822.0,Those eyes and beard...sexy...
AskGaybrosOver30,flm1taf,t1_fll468p,1585272614.0,I agree. There are two sides to every story. Opening a conversation is a good thing and may deepen your intimacy instead of ending something that you might have. Forgiveness might be easier.
SuicideWatch,flm10gn,t3_fpn7fr,1585272092.0,I totally get it.
AskGaybrosOver30,fl7spz2,t3_fmnf53,1584908570.0,I totally understand where you are coming from. We lost two dogs and a cat in two years. It’s a loss to recover from and you never do totally. Be kind to yourself.
AskGayMen,fl7rqjw,t3_fn58uv,1584907972.0,Where I live I’ve seen young and older guys do that. I like it personally but I think it’s going by the wayside. I totally get off getting watched and making dudes hot and blowing my load in them. I did the app thing when I was single but it was frustrating.
gaybrosgonemild,fl7gaur,t3_fn1y8m,1584901128.0,Well hello. Nice beard.
