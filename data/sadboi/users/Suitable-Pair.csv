Having said that, when I moved apartments I had a knife under each side of the bed, I barricaded the bedroom door and had a bat. I was petrified as I was living alone as my partner had not moved in yet and I was in a dodgy area at the time. I ended up taking diazepam at night to calm me, it’s the only thing that helped.

Honestly, it appears you’re doing all you can atm. The only suggestion I can make is maybe get curtains to stop the arguing? It does get better...

..... but on a side note, once my partner moved in I relaxed. That’s when we had a break in. On Halloween. At 6am when we were asleep in bed. I came face to face with them in the hall. I was naked and had stopped putting the knives and bat by the bed. So I had no means of defence. Things were nasty for five mins but in the end he left.... anyway, my point is, I always think it wise to keep something near you in bed, just in case. Seeing as you are in the US, a gun if need be (although statistically you probably shouldn’t..).

I think the worry will ease soon and normal living will resume. Just carry out the precautions mentioned then try and calm yourself about it.."
ptsd,fmrtgcj,t3_fvsqng,1586334844.0,"I’m finding it extremely difficult too due to many traumatic experiences happening in this apartment and being unable to escape. It is definitely a real struggle only being able to leave once a day for half an hour. It’s also just the psychological impact of knowing that I cannot leave, not just the physical limitation.

My normal soothing methods no longer work and I really can’t seem to figure any replacement out. So, currently I’m watching a tonne of the series Luther and I’m on diazepam for when things get really bad. Hopefully this won’t go on for too much longer!

Sorry, I really have no advice as I don’t have an answer, but solidarity is surely better than isolation in this situation. Good luck.."
ptsd,fmqs1uc,t3_fwqvkv,1586305827.0,I find it infinitely worse. I was at one point stuck in the apartment for a year and a half with no one to talk to and such awful symptoms. The isolation then was enough to traumatise me again. Being forced to stay is terrible. It’s bringing back all bad memories and symptoms. There is nothing I can do about it either..
