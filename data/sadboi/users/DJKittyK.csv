Infidelity,fpwpc0z,t3_gfuffn,1588967515.0,"The biggest red flag for me was him becoming very secretive and protective of his phone.  

We shared a phone for YEARS because we were pretty broke when we first got together, and eventually got separate ones.  He never minded me messing with his phone, and I never snooped, just used it to look at weather or time, sometimes he'd show me things on there, even watched vids together occasionally or looked up random websites, etc.  

Then all of a sudden if I even glanced his way while he was on his phone he would either tilt the screen away, switch apps really fast, or lock it and put it face down.  If I reached for the phone (early on it was innocent, then I tried it to see what he'd do), he'd snatch it out of my reach before I could, and defensively ask what I wanted.  One time he snapped at me when I was just going to hand it to him, since I was in between him and his phone and he got a message alert... he freaked out to beat me to touching it that day, and I wasn't even thinking about looking at the message, just wanted to help him get to it easier.

The strangest day was the one he was hiding his phone under a blanket on the floor while we were watching a movie on tv, giggling and texting away, and I pulled back the blanket to see what he was doing, saw a chat program.  He closed it and lied... tried to tell me he was just browsing funny websites.  After that, I got really suspicious, and I eventually found his AP's messages (notification alert I finally saw) and then he went more underground, hiding her name in his contact list under a fake guy's name.

Second big red flag was him ranting about not having any privacy... from me, his wife.  I didn't pry or snoop, and a simple question maybe like once a week like, ""Who ya messaging?"" when he would have his face GLUED to his phone screen, as he would send epic texts and laughing out loud to himself, would set off a rant of epic proportions, about how I didn't need to know, and that I was invading his privacy.

Well, it was his AP, and I had a right to know.

Anyway, watch for that shifty phone behavior!  It's a pretty good indicator.

I'm so sorry, hun.  I wish I had a magic wand to make this better for all of us... but the only person who could have done anything to make this turn out different (in your case) was your husband, and he chose not to.

Also, as an aside, this is not your fault.  The weight gain is a scapegoat reason... he's hoping you take the blame for his cheating, because it lets him get away with it.  Cheaters grasp at straws when caught to minimize what they did or justify it in a way you might accept so that they can continue their cheating ways without you being as suspicious.  He went so far as to bring her over and they both told you it was over... how convenient.

I tend to like games like Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Terraria, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley a lot (as well as other genres) just to give an idea where I'm coming from. And the new Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is on my wishlist.... that's probably my next game after Animal Crossing!

When we divorced/separated, he was to move in with his (male) friend, but instead moved in with his AP and they were together about a year until he got a good job, and they broke up.

So... no, they didn't get married, and broke up about a year after they were officially together.  I keep in touch with him due to financial reasons (he owes me money and is paying steadily) and he seems very single, but who knows, he's very good at hiding things and we're over 1k miles apart.  He's orbiting me again despite the distance... maybe he has regrets, I don't know.  

Life is weird and karma sneaks up on people when they least expect it.  Things are not sunshine and roses with them, make no mistake about that.  Always in the back of their minds they will know the truth about how they got together.  Regret will come for them both one day, even if they do stay together.

I always told him I loved him and that whatever was making him feel so low about himself we could work through.  But he never opened up to me once about the cheating. 

True to my word, when I found out about the cheating (not from him, I discovered it myself completely by accident) I told him we could work on it, all he had to do was let her go and be willing to try.  He wasn't willing to do either of those things, but strung me along for two more years pretending that he was.

He told me he couldn't.  Because it would be forced at that moment.  He claimed he would apologize when it felt right to do so, not when I *demanded* it.  Note, I didn't demand anything, I was answering his question about what I wanted.

I should have realized right then, that the reason he wasn't apologizing, was because *he wasn't actually sorry*.

I didn't get an apology until a couple weeks after we divorced and I moved 1500 miles away to live with family.  He said, ""Sorry for messing everything up"" in a text.

I'm sorry you're going through all this.  I was in a similar place when I realized that my ExH had never stopped seeing his AP, even though we were attempting to reconcile.

His AP, well, she's... a mess.  I probably sound bitter when I talk about her, but objectively she is horribly flawed in so many ways.  Nasty, no self-esteem, a ""model"" (she sells nudes and her underwear for a living, and also gets paid to be an escort), wears so much makeup she looks like a drag queen (no disrespect to drag queens), she looks strung out all the time, and she actively pursued a married man until she finally ""won"" him.

To demonstrate how delusional and sad she is/was, she once sent me a letter begging me to let my ExH go because they were soulmates and meant to be together, and if I would just let go then they could finally be together.  

Obviously it was me holding them back from being together, not my cowardly husband who had been lying to her about me from the get-go, telling her he was divorcing me and moving the goal posts on her for 5 fucking years. /s  But, I digress.

My point is... your ExH is no prize, neither was mine.  ""Winning"" our ExH's is like winning a ticking time bomb strapped to your arm, and hoping that it never goes off.

And as an anecdotal story, you may read this a lot around here where people say that the Ex and the AP rarely stay together, in my case, it took less than a year for them to break up and go their separate ways.  My stupid ExH has been sniffing around me for months online and texting trying desperately not to feel so alone.  I pity him, but I'm not stupid.

You know what's useful?  Coal.  You can burn that shit to stay warm, cook your food, cleanse your pores, purify your water.  Know what isn't useful?  Your ex.  You won, imho, not her, even in those moments you feel like you didn't.  You're free to find the real deal now, and she's stuck with a ticking time bomb.

Hang in there sister, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Infidelity,fgthoug,t1_fgtamm5,1581104561.0,"He was confirmed to have cheated on his ex multiple times, you said.  If he equates you to acting like her in this situation, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It just means that you are acting like a woman who suspects her SO of cheating on her... and he won't come clean, and doesn't seem to care enough to even reassure you, so how else are you going to act initially?

No doubt, he's vilified her and told you how ""crazy"" she was...  but if she discovered him cheating and then their trust was shattered, the root of her behavior is her trying to fix a relationship with a cheater, not of her just being randomly ""crazy"" or even unreasonable.

This does not bode well, and further supports the idea that he is up to no good. 

I'd be tempted to put hidden cameras in his place... or just end the relationship.  Because seriously, once trust is broken this badly, and the other half is making no effort to fix things, it's over anyway.

He offered the hug, I took it... I was falling apart, yet numb.  Not believing what was happening.  It didn't help, it only upset me more.  I had to pull over on the next street after I left and ugly cry for about 5 minutes before I could get back on the road.

Our relationship ultimately died, turns out that you can't reconcile when your cheating spouse never actually stops cheating.

Once I realized it was over, I told everyone who either asked, or was close enough to me to know.  I'm actually pretty glad I told my friends and family, as most of them jumped in to support me in ways I will never forget and will always be appreciative for.  The ones that blew me off, well, we're not friends anymore.

I only had one reflection question, and that was ""Will I regret staying or leaving more?""  I decided that I would have regretted leaving prematurely more, so I did everything I could to try and save the relationship.  It didn't work out, unfortunately.  I still wish it had.

One of the habits I'm in, having two cats, is taking one of those hand held vacs and going around the edges of my non-carpeted rooms daily.  It's amazing how much less hair and litter gets around if you are dedicated to doing it least once a day (and as needed).

I'd hate it if it took a long time, as vacuuming is one of my least favorite chores (second only to dusting, omg), but I'm usually done in less than 10 min, and only have to spend more time on carpeted areas.  Hopefully your small room will take even less time if you can keep the vac easily accessible.

survivinginfidelity,feiqgav,t3_ep4dm1,1579144646.0,"My two kitties gave me strength when I had nothing else but them.  They motivated me to be able to take care of them, food, housing, companionship.  And they motivated me to get out of bed every morning literally meowing happily at me in the morning, ready to have breakfast.  I don't have time to linger when my kitties are demanding food (in the cutest of ways).

I understand that feeling of wanting to get away.  I wanted it (and still do) to a degree, but having the pets is keeping me more grounded than if I didn't have them.  Pretty sure I'd be off working on a cruise ship or vegas or something random who knows where if I hadn't had them to think about.

And while that might not be the worst thing I could do, for now I'm with family and safe and secure while I heal, instead of out fending for myself with a broken heart.

Lean on your kitties a bit and see if you can enjoy taking care of them.  If you can't think of a new hobby, make excuses to get out of the house, even if it's just something like playing Pokemon Go (great for exploring and clearing your head) or walking around a mall.

In the early days I kept myself so busy I barely even remember what all I was doing.  But I did enough to tire myself so I could sleep, dreamlessly at night.  Hopefully that can work for you, too.

CPTSD,fegu3ug,t3_eoxj3n,1579102569.0,"My mother was pretty unstable when I was growing up.  She had undiagnosed depression and ptsd herself from her horrible childhood (she was abused physically and sexually and was the family scapegoat).

I used to journal so much.  Started when I was 9, when my grandfather bought me a diary when he went on a trip to France.  It's actually kinda cute, in that book I remember the front page in huge kid handwriting, ""My grandpa brought me a diary all the way from france!""

It continued into my teen years --  I had notebooks where I just wrote down my thoughts, my silly girl crushes, songs I liked, friend drama, family strife, and generally what happened on a day to day basis.  It was all relatively tame.

Then at some point I got a new journal.  It was red and black tartan covered, a typical ""flannel"" small-checkered design, and the binding was black.  I was a bit older then, maybe about 16, and so this journal was starting to take on subjects involving me becoming an adult -- sexuality, who I made out with or did more with, etc.

I stupidly left it in the living room one night and went to bed.  The next day when I got home from school, my mother got in my face, screaming at me for the things in there, mocking me and reading it aloud, telling me what I horrible person I was for having those thoughts and doing any of those things.  Reduced to tears and scared out of my mind, she made me rip the pages out and rip them up in front of her, then handed me the journal back and said to not let it happen again.

I cried for a long time over that one.  And decided the only way to protect myself from it happening again was to not write any more thoughts or events down.  This was a long time ago, before the internet was a thing, so I had no where I could store my thoughts without the risk of her finding it, so I just gave up.

I didn't stop writing though, but I did stop *journaling*.  I'm a creative writer (mostly speculative fiction) and share my work with no one in my family... I have this weird shame about it, that maybe someone will be offended by my writing.  I know it stems from this, even though there is a difference between journaling and writing fiction.

I've tried over the years to start journaling again (online) and it never lasts for long and feels impossible to do.  I feel like I will be judged, but really want feedback, so I don't want to make it private either.  It's a messed up mental block I might always have.

The last time I tried to journal, I had been detailing how amazing my ex-husband was, when he shut down a girl that had been flirting with him because I asked him to recognize it was inappropriate.  I sung the praises of how great our communication was, and that he must really love me to be able to do something like that for me (ie, cutting out a ""friend"", which I had never asked him to do before).

Turns out... as he is my ex-husband, he never actually did that and just lied to me over and over about it for almost 5 years.  I'm so humiliated and again, traumatized over reading that old journal that I shut it down and stopped writing again.

Double whammy, I suppose.  I was getting better at journaling after 20+ years of not being able to anymore and then a new trauma shut it down again.

Anyway, I don't really feel like I've lost too much.  But I do dislike it when people advise me to journal as a way to get my thoughts out.  Closest I have to being able to write anything down is reddit.  And that's been pretty decent, imho.
