Second, adultery is a choice people make. Rape is never a choice. I’m so sorry you had to experience it, let alone be criticized for your trauma. It’s a low blow, and purely to hurt you. Pay that no mind; no sane person who wants the best for you would ever insinuate anything else. 

Third, this man will not change. He is showing his true colors, and some things are unable to be repaired after a certain level. The giant red flag of rape vs adultery is the worst. He’s trying to control your mind into thinking you have to settle for him

I know we’re strangers, but please remember this: you can do so much better than him. He’s trying to hold onto his control over you, and belittling is part of his tactic. Get yourself someplace safe, and start making your exit plan. Again, I don’t know him, but from experience, he may try to play on your weaknesses, guilting you into staying. 

Please stay safe, and do whatever you can to remove yourself. If you need a shoulder, feel free to DM me ❤️"
mentalhealth,fr5u2mc,t3_gmu9xg,1589914677.0,"Most times, we can only be truly comfortable if we can be ourselves. Depending on your age, you may still need time to grow into yourself. Maybe it’s wearing the clothes you want and seeing if you’re an introvert. Maybe it’s as simple as listing out what hobbies/interests you enjoy, and reaching out to people with similar views. This may push your current friend group away, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. They will grow, just as you will, but the growth is not always down the same path 

Give it time. No one figured themselves out in a few weeks or months. Try new things, see where your interests lie, and focus on what’s just outside your comfort zone. It will help push you while not letting you be stagnant in your growth, and eventually you be comfortable there, too. Then you expand your comfort circle again, exponentially, and you will blossom 

Stay safe and hang in there. Time helps with a lot"

Some doctors are more flexible with phone calls or Skype due to the pandemic, so there should be something that might help until it's safe to physically go to someone's office. 

As far as your family, it seems cliche but try to be consistent in your tone with him. While yelling is counterproductive, so is avoiding help, which is a by product but still an issue. 

Also, don't feel guilty for feeling pushed to the edge. These are hard times and we're all adjusting to a new normal, so there's no such thing as a normal reaction to it. Remember to breathe, even try meditation if you feel yourself starting to lose it, but don't ever apologize for how you feel

Due to the fallout from the divorce, the 26+ years of marital cheating and lies, and him just being generally a scumbag, my fiance and I have decided he's not invited to the wedding, and will not be involved in our lives. There are things he did I cannot forgive, and I choose not to have that negativity in my life. 

Don't get me wrong, it sucks. It will always suck. I still remember the small good things he did when I was younger. I wish that was how he stayed. But it wasn't, and he can never go back to being that person. Over time, and yes more than a few years, things may take a new perspective for you.

If no one said anything to that much overkill, I promise no one will say anything to you.

It took years to get her to go to one, let alone talk to them. Her main fear was that she would get committed (she referred to it as “locked up”) and never see her family again.  

She told me that for her, it was an escape. A way to keep control a constantly uncontrollable world. She still struggles daily (I believe it’s nearly impossible not to), but I try to keep communication open with her. She’s recently found a psychiatrist and is on medication, but it worries me always. 

She always emphasized that it was never mine or anyone else’s fault. It’s simply  how her brain maintained “normal.” The best anyone can do for those who suffer with this is just to be there and listen. Constantly ask if she’s ok, what kind of day she had. In dark times, you may even need to help alleviate her guilt at relapsing. But never think this is your fault, it’s most likely a chemical imbalance or her way of coping with the mental trauma (children are terrible and mean sometimes).
