Louis Sullivan's understanding of ""function"" was clearly not intended to simply mean the pragmatic programmatic and efficient functions of a building's systems, seeing as his buildings were architecturally detailed and ornamented as much as any early Modernist building could have been.

The Modernists, even with their Neufert guides, clearly understood the spatial form of a building to take some sort of precedence in design, even when they also considered programmatic and systemic function of efficiency and contemporary cleanliness. Look at the sweeping gestures in the roof garden of Corb's Villas Stein and Savoye to plainly see that.

The phrase ""Form should ever follow function"" can be understood within the scope of historical architectural theory to represent the notion that the aesthetic form a building takes should be in line with the socio-philosophical function that building aspired to: if the building wanted to be a sanitarium, it wanted to be clean; so the form of the building should fall in line with that. If the building wanted to indicate luxury and ostentation, then its form should represent that (although in the Modernist paradigm, not necessarily through gilding and dripping decorations ala Baroque palaces and churches)."

Look to see if the design they're describing matches what they drew and put up on the wall. Look at their process work and see if you can tell how they got from A to B, and whether it consistently matches what they intended to create.

2) For design skills, you are entirely wrong. Lineweights are huge. Like I said, architects draw for a living. Show off that you can make drawings that really communicate. Exciting drawings are important, but it's not an either-or situation. Make drawings that are effective and strong architecturally, and also exciting.

Beyond that: locate, clean up, and lay out your sketches and study models. Those tell a lot more about your design thinking and process than finished renders.

Here's the thing about it:  


Digital skills are far less important than the design skills which make you valuable on a day-to-day basis. In most offices, at your level of experience, if you know how to use AutoCAD and Revit, you'll be fine as far as technology. Lots of firms outsource their renderings, although many still make simple 3D sketch models for internal use (so Sketchup and Rhino are good).

But what's critical is that you can tell them (and more importantly, demonstrate) that you have good design-thinking skills and that you have the common sense and wherewithal to put together useful drawings (e.g. details, annotated plans, sections, construction documents).

As far as your work experience, I suppose having some time in an office setting (regardless of the actual experience gained) is better than not, but architects will frequently want to know that you have some relatable experience working in an equivalent setting. Architects' offices are usually a lot different than other corporate environments.

&#x200B;

Onto your work sample:

Renderings are nice. Show more actual drawings though. I see you have some plans, but they're tiny. Be proud of your drawings. Architects draw for a living, so don't be shy about showing how you draw.

You need more work that shows your process. Not pretty post-hoc diagrams that were digitally done, but actual sketches and models that show how you think and arrive at a strategy and conclusion.

If you're going to show details and wall sections, make sure they're actually accurate. That double-skin facade is a bit cartoon-ish. I'd actually detail it out properly, and use standard conventions for annotation across the board to demonstrate that you can competently put together actual drawing sets."

HOWEVER, your employer having/allowing you to use your own laptop to do work will only ever happen if you're under a 1099 contract (independent contractor), rather than an employee, which is typically not going to be the kind of employment agreement you want directly out of school because of the following:

* The base pay at your level of experience directly out of school may be marginally more than if you were under a W-2 employee agreement; however, under a 1099, your employer won't take out any money for taxes (i.e. if you get paid $20 an hour for 40 hours a week, your paycheck will show exactly that, rather than with any form of deductions). The problem with this is that you will end up paying a substantial amount of money to the IRS in taxes, more than it is worth, considering:
* You probably don't have enough experience to be of value to multiple companies as a private contractor. You have no license, and you probably don't have any useful knowledge that would allow you to open contracts with multiple employers (which is typically the beauty of a 1099 contract). That means that the amount of money you're paying in taxes won't balance out with what you'll be making (which may or may not be slightly more than a W-2 contract).
* Under a 1099, you won't receive any sort of additional compensation (like health insurance, PTO, holidays, overtime, etc.). You'll be expected to cover these things out of your own pocket, but since you'll be likely receiving the same amount of base pay as an actual employee, plus the cost and responsibility of owning and maintaining your own computer and software licenses, you'll have a hard time getting on any sort of reasonable insurance or saving for unplanned expenses.

architecture,ewp6hpp,t1_ewozwur,1565634501.0,"Let me be clear, as I was with /u/vitruvious: I am not whole-heartedly defending the proposed addition to the Notre Dame in question. I am saying that I can appreciate the formal logic behind it, because there are unquestionable formal analogies to be made between the Gothic cathedral and the Modernist frame system. This is not a question of irrelevant and arbitrary arguments about anthills and concrete blocks. This is an A=A, B=B analogous comparison between two architectural forms.

Nowhere did I say that aesthetics are tantamount to sin. I simply posit (and will stand by my claim until I die) that aesthetics cannot be a determining factor in the evaluation of architecture. The art of architecture is in creating and organizing space. We may do so beautifully; we may do so artfully. But note the adjective there. Aesthetics is a consideration for architects.

If aesthetics were to be a determinant in the evaluation of architecture, it would mean we simply couldn't suggest that Le Corbusier's Villa Stein and Palladio's Villa Farnese possess the same architecture. And to suggest that would be blatantly ignorant, coming from someone practiced in the field of visual design. As a formalist, I simply cannot argue that aesthetics is fundamentally tied to architecture. I'm not going to suggest that it's not important; aesthetics are critical in the emotional perception of space, in a very particular way. But I will say that aesthetics (the specific non-spatial adornment of a surface) may not have any bearing on the consideration of something as being architectural space."
architecture,ewojjni,t1_ewoh6u9,1565619618.0,"Okay, a couple things to unpack here:

The first is that I very much agree with your point about nuance in formal propositions. We as architects (whether Modern or Traditional, contemporary or otherwise) should seek to propose additions to the urban environment that are complex (but uncomplicated), simple (yet not simplistic), childlike (but not childish), etc. I do think that recognizing the Gothic for the ultimate manifestation in what is essentially a frame system (as opposed to a mass system) is very critical to a reading of Gothic architecture. Yes, Mannerism (for example) also utilizes a system of bays as a compositional tool, but if you look at the Gothic in its most primal element, you'll find that it is essentially a proto-modern frame structure (in a formal way as well as literal structural). I will stress again that the Gothic, as opposed to the weight of the Renaissance after it, stresses verticality, the lightness of members, and particularly an extreme of parts constituting a larger whole. The Renaissance was about humanistic composition that employed the use of Classical elements, but the Gothic was very much about an ordering system of vaults, which could be shifted, skewed, repeated, and stretched to fit the building's needs and desires.

So if you look at the Gothic forms that line the city streets of Venice's Grand Canal, you'll find a very proto-Modernist arrangement of columns and thin, almost stretched, wall surfaces which formally predicts the free facade of Le Corbusier's works. If you want to explore this more, look at the canal-facing facade of the Ca' d'Oro, particularly the corner, and how it meets the mass of the building. This was only posssible due to the frame (as opposed to mass) nature of the Gothic as a stylistic system.

Therefore, I don't find it abhorrent for a contemporary addition to play off of this nature of the Gothic. I definitely agree that more should have been done with that proposal, and that leaving it as it is, shown in the renderings, is extremely premature; as if the designer stopped after a parti and didn't develop it into a multi-layered proposition. I'm simply saying I can appreciate the base sentiment for the design beyond the gut reaction of ""how dare you put what amounts to a shipping container right in front of the Notre Dame!"".

To look at where the proposal should sit within the urban fabric as you have is one way to interpret it, and it is valid. But here's another way to look at it:

Not everything in a city is fabric, and not every new addition should be treated as such. The Notre Dame sits on its own island at the center of the city. It's a huge monument. Surely a designer could also make a case that an addition or renovation to the Notre Dame could be treated as an extension of that monument instead of simply standing adjacent to it. The Notre Dame doesn't need a built square in front of it. That would ruin the impact of what's already been done. While I agree that the current proposal does ruin the already-established void of space in front of the building, I disagree that it should contribute to the building of an explicit courtyard, which would bear no semblance to what a great church wants. You don't see that condition with San Lorenzo; or with any of the churches in England or America. This is a very different condition to SS Annunziata, for example, and I believe it should be treated differently."

I figure that an architect should immediately appreciate the equality here in purity of volume, the expression of a modularity and repetition of bay, and the continuation of an axis generated from the apse of the cathedral out through the new volume at the front.

architecture,ewn2xjn,t1_ewn0iu5,1565567106.0,"RE: 1.: I don't think it's an artificial distinction in the negative way you ascribe it to be. Space-making and space decoration/ornament (which are two separate groups of small-scale design in themselves) are different. You can take what is essentially the same box, and decorate the walls with a specific kind of trim, use an authentic paint color, put in various kinds of tables and styles of windows, and depending on your deliberate choice there, the ubiquitous box will suddenly become ""Neo-Classical"", or ""Spanish Colonial"" or ""Queen Anne"". Space-making is irrelevant to these kinds of styles. But the articulation of architectural space, reliant upon systems of circulation, and ordering structures of symmetry, hierarchy, composition, datum lines, etc., is often divorced from the specific nature of the building's ornamentation. This is why Colin Rowe was able to find an articulated comparison between Palladio's Malcontenta and Corb's Villa Stein.

RE: 2.: I fundamentally disagree with this point. Not all buildings are architecture. If you take a picture with the camera on your phone, does that make what you did photography? No, it's simply a photo you took with your phone. There is something more to the art of architecture than the simple act of erecting a structure, and it's sad to me that you would devalue your own craft in such a way as to suggest otherwise.

RE: 3.: Please tell me what you mean by contemporary materials which don't fall under either ""natural"", ""man-made"", or ""tooled"", because I can't think of a single material which isn't one of those three. If you're supposing to argue that steel and glass are bad because they're mass-produced and synthetic, then I implore you to question how that's any worse than the tonnes beyond tonnes of concrete that were used by the Romans; or the glass that has been used for huge windows in European buildings for hundreds of years.

RE: 4.: I can get behind this argument that beauty might somehow be a mimicry of human qualities like textural variation, symmetry, hierarchy, rhythm, etc.; but in that case, I'd highly suggest you actually study Modern works (not necessarily developer office parks of the 80s to today, but actual works of Le Corbusier, Mies, FLW, and Alvar Aalto to name a few); what you'll find, if you study them diligently, is all of these ordering structures at multiple scales. As far as nature is concerned, Le Corbusier championed rooftop gardens and terraces; Mies' Barcelona Pavilion and Farnsworth House were both heavily invested in the natural environment; and FLW's houses were designed entirely on a notion of a natural Modernism.

RE: 5.: Or maybe they are considered ubiquitous because they've been so heavily accepted socially. Who's to say?

RE: 6.: Or maybe the reason we romanticize the past (and thus traditional architecture) simply because we have a tendency to yearn for the ""good ol' days"". Ask any generation of people, and they will always say things weren't as bad as they are now; you'll be guilty of it too when you get older if you haven't done so already.

RE: 7.: No, I would argue that they are more romanticized in part because we have an irrational fear of Communism (and it must be admitted that much of Modernism was concerned with political-social movements that leaned towards Communism); and of course because we all for some reason want to escape our current troubles to go back to when things were ""simpler"", like the disgusting smoke-filled horrid environment of the Victorian era. Public opinion is idiotic and should have no bearing on whether or not something is considered a valid form of art. No other design discipline does this. You don't see graphic designers shunning graphic design that isn't liked by the masses, do you? Or musicians, or furniture makers for that matter.

RE: 8.: Okay, what the fuck; no. Michelangelo was a ""hero-architect"". Palladio was a ""hero-architect"". And in ancient history, we often have to attribute designs to the buildings' patrons, because they were glorified as the designer (even when we're pretty sure they didn't actually do it), like the case of the Pantheon being attributed to Hadrian. But even when you go back to the Ancient Greeks, you'll see Callicrates and Ictinus being glorified as the creators of the Parthenon. Architects have always been glorified as design geniuses, and for some reason, we now want to cower and crowdsource design to the public, who has no clue what they actually want in anything, which is why they come to professionals in the first place. Sorry, no.

I will concede that I do see a problem with architecture today, which is that it has moved away from a general preoccupation with form and composition (the foray of architects for thousands of years), and has instead become lost in numbers and data, choosing to pinpoint technological issues (such as energy efficiency, ergonomics, the internet, digital tech integration, etc.), and then substitute those for a substantial design intent based on artful and tasteful composition, and therein lies, of course, your problem with ""modern"" architecture not having beauty. We agree there. We simply attribute the problem to two different sources, and suggest wildly different solutions."
architecture,ewmscye,t1_ewmqrei,1565559330.0,"Don't apologize for posing an argument. The discourse on architecture can only exist if people are willing to take a stance on it when others disagree.

But the difference between your view and mine is subjectivity. As long as you only view great architecture through the lens of personal taste and ideas of beauty, you'll always only ever see the discipline in a subjective sense.

I am positing that architecture stands aside from subjective taste. Sure, architecture may often be beautiful (to me, or to others), but that doesn't suddenly discount ugly buildings from being architecture, because it's not about beauty. It's about the organization and pursuit of form. Architecture is about space-making.

To add to this topic: what exactly makes traditional buildings more beautiful than Modern (with a capital M) ones? I'd be surprised if you can give me any sort of quantifiable, measurable, and objective data to say that there's something inherent in Classically adorned buildings that makes them superior to Modern ones in terms of beauty.

Rather, I'd say that a collective idea of beauty is more about socially ingrained norms; that we only find the city of Rome to be beautiful as a whole because it's what tradition dictates. We romanticize the cultures of the past, and so we naturally see their buildings as being more beautiful. When you couple this with the longstanding use of traditional architecture to represent wealth, power, elegance, and grace in media (celebrity worship, TV shows and movies, characters in books, etc.), it makes for a compelling argument to anyone who doesn't think about it too much that traditional architecture **must** be beautiful, and Modern architecture (being constantly mocked by popular Media, being seen as the common man's architecture, the status quo of those evil anonymous corporations that we're forced to work for every day) **must** be lackluster in comparison.

I can't argue with you that aesthetic considerations haven't ever been a part of architecture and its design history. Of course they have. But I'm also of a similar mind to Colin Rowe, which is to examine the actual architectural work for itself, and not the writings of its creators; Palladio's temple fronts surely weren't done for aesthetic reasons, because it was objectionable at the time, that flagrant association of specific individuals with a holy symbol of the Church; no, it was done for formal and semantic reasons, to provoke and create new connections between existing things.

Yet of course today, we'll look at Palladio's Villa Rotonda and say it's beautiful because we like to romanticize the culture of the Italian Renaissance, because older styles of architecture are so enchanting and traditional for weird mystical, completely irrational reasons. And that's not a bad thing. But to conflate that with an actual basis for architecture, that we can objectively say what is beautiful or not, is a really dumb and hubristic mistake on our parts as designers."
architecture,ewmnq7m,t1_ewmj818,1565556085.0,"I am so sick and tired of traditionalists espousing the false notion that architecture is about aesthetic taste. It has never been about what ""looks good"", and for good reason. It has been well established that taste is subjective. I happen to think that the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and St. Peter's at the Vatican are horrendously ugly, yet they are loved by so many people for their ""beauty"". By the same token, there have been tons of debates over whether or not Brutalism as an entire style looks good, with sources being cited to serve both sides of the issue.

Architecture **has never been about what looks pretty** regardless of the whatever drivel architects might write down. Architecture **has always been about formal arrangement and achievement,** from the conscious planning of monuments in Rome, to Palladio and the Mannerists, to Paxton's Crystal Palace, to the Modernist works of the 20th century. Architects have always reworked what came before them in new ways, to express abstract thought.

If you think that expressing formal ideas as a basis for architecture is ""overthinking everything,"" then it only says that you are too lazy as a designer to do anything than copy the endless masses of decrepit buildings of the past four hundred years than to do any real work in coming up with something that actually adds to the discourse of the discipline. There were classical masters of architecture, sure—Palladio, Michelangelo, Borromini, Brunelleschi, Alberti, in no particular order; and that's just from Italy—but to act as though you are doing some service to the profession by incessantly copying the inferior derivative works of Nicholas Hawksmoor (talk about a true waste of the potential of the 18th century!) is patently false; you're simply stopping history in its tracks to revert to some notion of the ""good ol' days"" of architecture.

Maybe your underdeveloped notion of what a skyscraper could be leads you to think that they must always be full of tiny cubicle-like rooms and full of banal sterility; clearly you've never experienced the entry level of Philip Johnson's AT&T building; clearly you've never seen anything to do with the Downtown Athletic Club. Because if you had any nuanced understanding of the innovations that architects have come up with in space-making, you'd know that skyscrapers have lent themselves to extraordinary spatial quality, light and air, and social space well in comparison to what Canaletto suggests about the civic life of Venice.

Traditionalists who are under the impression that the goal of architecture should be ""beauty"" are simply playing architect in the same way as my uninformed relatives who only ever talk about ""Queen Anne this"" and ""Spanish Colonial Revival that"". You are kidding yourself into thinking that you can ever achieve anything as great as the Classical Masters if you ignore the fundamental questions about form and composition."
architecture,ewma1u0,t1_ewm8859,1565546680.0,"Abstract connections are what has advanced architecture for millennia. The Gothic wouldn't exist without an abstract understanding of the found objects of the Roman Empire. Renaissance, Mannerism, and Baroque wouldn't exist without an abstract understanding of Classical works. Modernism wouldn't have existed without an abstract understanding of the Renaissance.

Just because you can form an abstract connection between any two things doesn't mean that they're all equally valuable. Every form of art applies abstraction, whether in a deliberate and complex manner, or in a simple and reductive one.

Actually, people hate low-grade Modernism. All of the shitty developer apartments that are ""modern""; strip malls and office parks that are ""modern""; these are despised by the general public and architects alike. But people love Frank Lloyd Wright; people think Mies buildings are cool; people will travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see Eero Saarinen works (like the Arch in St. Louis). People don't hate Modernism, they hate modern (read: contemporary) garbage produced by developers and uninformed, low-budget, low-effort clients.

So your whole argument about the ""unwashed masses"" not appreciating Modern architecture is unsubstantiated, but I understand where you're coming from, when we use the same word to refer to actual architecture and also poorly developed contemporary garbage, the latter having no real connection to the former other than the near-fetishization of glass and steel."

Okay, it's probably not a smart PR move to compare a Gothic cathedral to a shipping container. HOWEVER, when you look at the two design structures from a purely formal standpoint, there is, in fact, a semantic connection to be made. You have to understand that the Gothic style is really defined by its bay-module, and by the sequence of operations that can be applied to it. The Gothic is almost a proto-parametric design agenda.

You start with the nondescript module of a Gothic bay, which is produced typically by the vault. It's just an implication of space defined by four columns and a surface at the top which binds the columns together, suggesting a whole and pure space. This space, this bay, can then be stretched along an axis; it can be twisted and skewed along a curve or plane; and most importantly, it gets replicated over and over with varying degrees of modulation to its dimensions and form, which produces the larger compositions. A Gothic church isn't defined by the individual form of the Gothic bay; rather, the Gothic bay acts as almost a contemporary grid system in which space just happens. That's what makes it so great: in a way, it's ubiquitous.

The shipping container reveals similar characteristics in its formal qualities: a nondescript bay which can be replicated, stretched, skewed, and filled with other things that define the space inside of it; the shipping container implies a spatial boundary, and the things you do to it further define the interior qualities of that relatively pure space. There are echos of the Gothic in the almost anonymous regularity, the structural rhythm, and the cadence of form that appears in the shipping container.

Of course a general superficial glance at the two things—the Notre Dame and the contemporary shipping container—won't reveal these similarities; they're on a deeper formal level, and so this comparison probably wouldn't be appropriate for such a publicly emotionally charged building. But through a purely formal lens, they are definitely related, and to dismiss that as nonsense that a five-year-old could see is, at best, willfully ignorant and damaging to the further dissemination and proliferation of compositional and formal ideas that architecture relies on as an art form.

I think it's really sad that someone who claims to be a reactionary in the realm of architectural art has closed their mind to abstract connections, and resorts to mocking a high-rise building for associating itself with the ideals of Canaletto, seemingly on the basis that they just hate modern architecture (for some arbitrary personal aesthetic reason). Obviously the contemporary high-rise doesn't look visually like a Renaissance painting of Venice; that's not the point. The connection being made is an abstract one, that this high-rise wants to act in the same socially dense manner from which Canaletto viewed the Grand Canal. There's a lot more to say on the subject of this article and I could pick it apart for hours, but I doubt anyone wants to read a long diatribe on Reddit."

&#x200B;

But before 1870, bricks were all made by hand, and the outside faces weren't as tough. They were susceptible to the weather and needed to be protected. In the 19th century (and even slightly earlier due to availability of paint), bricks were definitely coated with multiple layers of paint as a strategic way of protecting the brick from rain, snow, mold, and temperature fluctuations that would otherwise destroy the structural integrity of the brick."
AskReddit,ev0ldbr,t1_ev0dxa5,1564141329.0,"Fun fact: before about 1870, clay brick masonry buildings were often meant to be painted, and often still should when you're considering preservation and modern maintenance, because the much older brick was made and fired by hand, which means it doesn't have the same strength on its dress face (the outside face that you see) as machine-made bricks (starting in about 1870).

Chances are if the house was built 300 years ago, it was painted during the 19th century, mostly in order to help protect the brick."

bipolar,eq71gqj,t1_eq6jf2o,1559838942.0,"Yeah, ""ultradian"" (ultra-rapid) cycling has been observed in some folks with bipolar. I've experienced real highs and severe lows in as short a span as a day or two. The thing I'm pointing out is those whose manic behavior conveniently stops when they realize no one's looking. When they're jumping from ""ecstatic"" to ""unhinged"" to ""suicidal"" to ""mellow"" and back all in the span of 30 minutes (and I put these in quotes because they're usually so dramatized and over-the-top, like caricatures), it's almost categorically not bipolar disorder. There may very well be underlying problems that contribute to this behavior, but from my experience of years discovering a disorder that confused me all the way til I was 22, it just doesn't seem plausible. BP isn't a rapid-fire ""happy/sad/crazy/sweet/manipulative/etc."" switch. I can't turn it off when it's convenient, or just ""be happy"" to counteract the depression, nor can I just easily ""mellow out"" when I'm happily destroying myself with mania."

Cool Kid bipolar: self-described as spontaneous; ""if you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best""; has ""manic episodes"" which last thirty minutes during which they twitch and laugh a lot before returning to normal when they realize no one's watching anymore; identifies with the Joker from Batman.  


Actual bipolar: is usually pretty ashamed of manic episodes, which leave gaps and gray areas in their long term memory over the course of weeks to months; drops into deep depression and hates themselves enough to plan out and sometimes attempt suicide;  is described by others as ""hard to read"" because over the course of a year their mood and affect switches between extreme highs and lows; has sensitive relationship with doctors and medication, self-doubt and official diagnosis."
