4. As much as I like stamps I am unable to refuse those cute stickers, plus mail service here always damages postcards in some kind of way when they're bare.

Languages are different, you might learn one fast and one slow, it depends on your native tongue and languages you can already speak. A Turkish native will learn Korean easier than an English native and so on, based on language similarities. Of course that's not the only factor here but B1 in 3 months seems very unrealistic, even with the factors considered like being in the country and surrounding yourself with the language at all times plus lessons. 

If you think you can pull it off though, then all the power to you. This is just a stranger on the internet's opinion so I wouldn't let that hold me back. I can still understand getting a different perspective to things however. Good luck, I hope you can do it and save some time and money."
