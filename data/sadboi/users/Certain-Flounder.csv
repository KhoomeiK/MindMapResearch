Every argument you’ve made has refused to acknowledge that other nations have been able to do this successfully and that your constitution is no longer relevant to either your own or other countries. I would argue that the vast majority of constitutions are no longer all that relevant to the modern world, it is just that the inclusion of a bill of rights in the American constitution that makes it considerably more dangerous. Regardless of your beliefs in terms of the importance of existing laws, you need to argue without using an appeal to authority for your point to stand (meaning prove the reasons behind the laws) but you have simply stated the laws, rather than even explaining why they should be important and impacting their importance."
Ask_Politics,fkc2ibk,t1_fkc2b0e,1584044516.0,"You’re using a logical fallacy to argue a point and you respond to all of my points with the same fallacy, this discussion isn’t going anywhere because you refuse to advance your point. These laws may seem relevant from your perspective, and they are somewhat relevant when arguing the logistics of gun control in the US, but they’re not at all relevant when discussing the principles of gun control."

I can explain the contrary: firstly, your ad hominem attacks don’t actually prove your points, but I’ll tell you why my beliefs don’t make me ignorant anyway. I’ve explained to you already the reasons that the American constitution, however you have never backed it up except with “it’s in the constitution so it’s good.” This is an appeal to authority and doesn’t even begin to prove your point. If the American constitution is the only thing that backs up your views, all that proves is your own ignorance and the American-centric nature of your arguments. Using your own logic, I can tell you that gun control is valid because it exists in Australian law. I would say it is quite likely that you wouldn’t accept that argument. Why? Because I haven’t told you why gun control is important or why we should have it, only that it exists, but this is the same argument that you have made against gun control. I don’t really know if this conversation can go much further unless you are willing to step out your views."
Ask_Politics,fkby0gp,t1_fkbxcsa,1584042047.0,"Ah, sorry, I didn’t realise that because I don’t live in America I don’t understand guns or politics. This is some American-centric bullshit. I will genuinely never be able to understand why Americans won’t listen to people who haves lived experience with gun control. It protects people. That’s the end of it. You seem incredibly upset (in fact, you’ve resorted to insults to prove your point - an ad hominem fallacy) over something that shouldn’t even be relevant to modern life anymore. The American constitution (specifically the bill of rights) has resulted in more harm that good: it is used to defend violence and hate speech and that is something that I can never stand for. Honestly, a total lack of a bill of rights seems to be protecting people’s rights better, that’s not a good sign."
Ask_Politics,fkbx1ta,t1_fkbwpbm,1584041523.0,"This is ridiculous. For a long time Alabama could segregate schools and women couldn’t vote, under the constitution. Cars kill people, so we implement speed limits and force people to wear seat belts. That’s actually a really great analogy for gun control, but you don’t seem to understand anything about it. I don’t really think “I need a gun to threaten homeless people” is a good reason to give everyone free reign over any type of weapon, honestly, it just makes you sound like a shitty person. And threatening violence? Honey, you sound desperate."
Ask_Politics,fkbw4f4,t1_fkbvk9i,1584041014.0,"Honey your constitution was written over 200 years ago. Do you think it’s fine without changing? You guys are so defensive about your constitution, I don’t know whether to laugh or cry. I don’t know if you realise what a joke you are to the rest of the world, trying to defend keeping these guns that we would never even think of wanting. Guns kill people. That’s not a controversial statement. The government needs to protect people, often one of the ways it can do that is to restrict the use of guns. It should also be noted here that most forms of gun control still allow people to have guns, they’re just only allowed to have guns that are less likely to be used in mass shootings. You guys are killing school kids with guns, how can you defend a system that stands for that?"
Ask_Politics,fkbv2ew,t1_fkbufxu,1584040436.0,"Your constitution is outdated and irrelevant. Constitutions can also be amended. The founding fathers wrote the constitution at a time when the guns available looked incredibly different to what we have available today. They could not have possibly foreseen the advancement of technology that has led to the guns that people now have access to. I assume the constitution is why you think it’s not legally possible, but it is possible to amend constitutions, and even if it wasn’t the right to bear arms doesn’t mean that one has to have access to every type of gun at all times with no restrictions. Having access to a reasonable amount of power and ammunition for a relevant activity is something that is permissible under most laws around gun control. In terms of the logistics of gun control, gun buy backs and gun amnesties have worked incredibly well in Australia and have resulted in very few illegal guns remaining in the hands of citizens."
Ask_Politics,fkbuck0,t1_fkbtu3j,1584040040.0,"Are you seriously trying to argue that gun control is bad because not enough people die for it to be an issue? People are dying, you can’t possibly spin that into not being a problem. Other issues are also bad (that point is a red herring fallacy btw) but that doesn’t mean we can’t deal with something as simple as gun violence. Even suicide rates can be brought down by gun control: if people don’t have access to guns, they can’t use them to suicide, and as guns are one of the most effective methods, this would bring down suicide rates. Honestly, this argument is one huge reason that American politics is a joke to the rest of the world, apparently all the deaths that occur because of gun violence just aren’t important. That’s ridiculous. The role of the government is ultimately to protect people, so that is what the government needs to do."

Ask_Politics,fkbtbda,t3_fhit0y,1584039464.0,"Because banning guns protects people. The biggest evidence we have of the impact of gun control is looking at countries with different levels of gun control. Take Australia, where one mass shooting in 1996 resulted in stricter gun regulations and no mass shootings since vs the US, where we’re constantly hearing about mass shootings. The reality is that the government needs to protect people and if that means going against what Marx said (keeping in mind that Marx was also writing in a time when the guns that both civilians and the military had access to were very different and could do much less damage) then that is what we need to do."

It’s definitely still because of capitalism that he was forced to work: casual employees are paid very little and have irregular shifts, meaning that they don’t have a stable income a lot of the time, so can’t take time off work.
