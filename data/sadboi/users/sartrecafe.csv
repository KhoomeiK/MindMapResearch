PlasticSurgery,fpume38,t1_fprr67i,1588916842.0,"The laser tightening takes quite a while to see results, and are usually very mild at best. They take a while to see but basically work by helping your skin produce more collagen. My sister did it and said the results faded quickly. 

I’d invest my money in either plasma fibroblast or fillers. I’ve seen men get fillers and they look very good and I would have never noticed they had fillers."
PlasticSurgery,fprban7,t3_gek9uk,1588849022.0,"I’ve seen men get tear trough filler that you can benefit from. I would go in for a consultation or do a virtual consultation, and I think a little bit of Voluma Xc filler in your upper part of the cheeks will pull your skin up slightly and help a lot, in addition to the tear trough filler. Voluma XC is great because it lasts almost 2 years and is great for definition. 

I’ve also seen impressive results with Plasma Fibroblast. You might want to google that. 

Lastly, you might want to look up is getting laser skin tightening. It’s fairly inexpensive, but helps tighten your skin. 

Other lifestyle habits can also help, such as wearing sunscreen everyday, a good moisturizer, adequate sleep, water and eating healthy plant based fats and protein; all while minimizing processed foods, alcohol, sugar and smoking. All of these basically increase gravity’s effect on your face."

BPDrecovery,fpeurp9,t1_fpetfas,1588555376.0,"It’s done by a doctor who specializes in trauma. And it basically talks about yoga and mindfulness as helping ptsd and cptsd, which tends to happen commonly with bpd (I have it this way too). It’s a little long, but helpful to see how the body stores trauma. As much as I hate the whole “do yoga for mental health” thing, I find it does help my bpd to do it. I didn’t finish the book because and skipped chapters a lot, so it might talk about bpd. 

Here are some YouTubers I like: 

This is Dr. Daniel fox, I find his videos helpful: 
https://youtu.be/R446HO0nCFs

She is also a therapist and has helpful videos: 
https://youtu.be/hDJi86n9-Rk (this video she talks about DBT skills, which tend to be helpful for ppl with bpd)

Here’s another of hers for quick dbt skills:

Another of hers that u might like: 
https://youtu.be/ftL7l4KiHag

For trauma based yoga: https://youtu.be/WajHoXJac_c (there’s a lot, but I mostly do this one because it’s short)

I listen to Tara Brach when I freak out and need to hear something about letting go or mindfulness and trauma. The whole pandemic thing messed me up in the beginning, but I find listening to her really helps when I’m self sabotaging others freaking out or get into my dark spirals. She’s a neuroscientist and Buddhist.

Ratedbygirls,fo0vsgt,t3_g510z0,1587420692.0,"Depends on your skin care issues. (This is what I’m recommended, but it all varies based on your needs) When I would go to my aesthetician, she recommends washing your face once a day (morning is just lukewarm warm) then use a toner first with a cotton round, then I use a serum. I have rosacea, so I use a moisturizing serum - Amino Acids + B5 by an inexpensive company called The Ordinary. But some people use a vitamin c serum to help make skin glow, resurface dead skin cells and prevent oxidative stress on skin. Then I use an eye cream. After I use my moisturizer followed by sunscreen always. 

So as a rule of thumb..
1- wash skin
2- toner 
3 - serum 
4 - moisturize 
5- sunscreen 

A company me and my partner use is The Ordinary, because they’re super cheap but very effective. If you look at their site, you can email them asking for products they recommend and they’re super helpful. https://deciem.com/contact and then click on “products and regimens.” You can purchase their stuff on sephora app or ulta or other skincare providers. 

Your future self will thank you for it too. 

Hope this helps! :)"

Ratedbygirls,fnyeykr,t3_g4hlb2,1587361114.0,"5.5- I think you have stunning features. I’d play them up. Like your lips and skin and hair. Moisturizing your skin and hair will help. Also finding clothes that suits your figure would help, maybe not white with pink stripes, bc that washes you out, but more earth toned colors. A highlighter (like by Fenty) would look so pretty on you, but bc you have beautiful features, I’d try to play up one or two, but so they compliment each other, not fight each other (like bold lip and bold eye). I think a thickening masacra would be nice on you or natural false eyelashes. Lastly contouring your face would help, but with highlighter, so like on the top of your nose and cheekbones and philtrum and in the inner corners of your eyes."
