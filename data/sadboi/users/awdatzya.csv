Dream,fm2vvf6,t3_fsiv2s,1585706620.0,"basically we dream every night because it's brain's way of ""digesting"" stuff that happened the whole day and also learning. contrary to a popular belief, you don't need rem phase to dream, but this stage is crucial in the process of regeneration and learning. 
so yes, you're always dreaming when in a deep state of dreaming (so naps don't always produce dreams), but you simply don't remember your dreams"

I hope you will get better soon!"

AskReddit,fc048lk,t3_efbygd,1577277812.0,"the way u use cutlery. in Europe we (mostly) have a fork in a left hand and a knife in a right hand during the whole meal.
