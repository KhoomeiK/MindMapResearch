I have about 2 months worth of player experience. I've never played anything but 5e. I have a specific character in mind that I'd love to play if all goes well :) As for myself, I play drums, video games, and am in a master's program at the moment. Those things occupy most of my time."

For context though, they are in Phandalin. It's not exactly a seedy town, but there are plenty of people that just pass through and leave, and it's a very low population, so it doesn't sound outrageous either."

DnD,fhwm508,t1_fhwl04d,1581920429.0,"Well, as for the extra items, I think that there will have to be a bit of creative dispersement on my part. Maybe if the bard is killed, the items all teleport to random places throughout the planes. Though, I'd still want to reward the players for succeeding, so maybe the armor in question isn't tethered to this particular spell yet.

And I think that's certainly a possibility, having separate motivations, but I am imagining these two to be long-term partners, and to some extent, friends. I imagine they have something in common, like a certain perspective on the world. So with different motivations it would feel like they're using each other more so than trying to see one another succeed in this case. Nonetheless, it's something to think about, and definitely broadens my creative horizons."
DnD,fhwjs7r,t1_fhwj3gy,1581918068.0,"Beautiful. Exactly the kind of help I was hoping for. You've given me a couple questions to guide the process of creation here.

I think that as it stands, they feel more like one-off villains, but we'll see where the wind takes us with that. I hadn't thought of them as militaristic, but I really like some of the possibilities you suggested. I'll consider that avenue more. And while they don't feel cult-y either, I think that those are awesome suggestions for religious motivations. If I go the religious route, I think it's more likely they'll be recurring."

I could never understand what you've been through, but I know it must be harder than anything, so if by chance you happen to see this, I'm rooting for you. And remember, no part of you ever wanted to hurt your girlfriend. Sometimes people will say things like ""drunk words are sober thoughts,"" but really, if they had any idea how alcohol worked, they'd understand that isn't true. You're fighting your own battle, and your girlfriend was fighting hers. Unfortunately we aren't always emotionally equipped to handle everything life throws at us. That's why we need to be good. Be the kind of person you'd want to be friends with and you will attract those sorts of people. They will be there for you when you need them, and you in return for them. Never be afraid to ask for help, nor to accept it. It's hard enough as it is.
