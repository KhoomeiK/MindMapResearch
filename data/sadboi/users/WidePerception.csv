Now, if you really feel the need to help him then just give him some cash.

Also, he doesn't sound very financially responsible. That already is a red flag to begin with! Since you said your relationship has been on and off with him, that isn't a stable relationship to begin with at all. Who knows what he will do with your money. If you guys have experienced trust issues and relationship problems before then it can happen again. Just keep whatever that is yours private and for yourself.

depression,f7x654j,t3_dxp0co,1574047330.0,"I use to feel the same way as well! I realize depression is extremely hard to recover from, but it is not impossible. Everything in life requires taking little baby steps. Try to be positive and do something every single day. It can be as little as organizing the bookshelf or whoa I got this cool hobby I kind of miss and I should give it a try again. It is little things like that which will create sparks in your life and it can help you tremendously. 

Also, don't be too harsh on yourself. I realize that when I was extremely depressed to the point I didn't get out bed for about a whole summer I was just very hard on myself. I stopped caring about everything that shouldn't matter anymore. I realize that the truth is others will always be happier, look better, be more successful than me and so much more. 

Just because others seem to be the perfect picture of what life should be about doesn't mean that I can't be happy and won't live a worthy, fulfilling life. Life is short and honestly we only have about 80-85 years to live. The clock is always ticking, forget about everyone else and work on yourself. Be the best version on yourself day in and day out.

That is what a funeral is for. A funeral is to honor the death of a love one and for god's sake he is your brother and your husband should 100% be there to comfort you! 

If he doesn't want to go then that really speaks a lot about his character and who he really is. Not only that, but you guys have a 13 and a 15 year old, he needs to set an example as what to do when someone passes away! If it was a friend or just someone you know people should always make time to honor the death of someone they knew. Life is precious! Clearly, it doesn't seem like he's grieving at all or really feels what you feel.

Most importantly, I would say he needs to be a good husband and be there for his wife and his two kids! He needs to set good examples for his kids! This is bigger than a funeral. This is paying respect and having manners. He needs to GO! THERE IS NO IF'S AND BUT'S.

If he cannot tell that you are uncomfortable then it seems like he doesn't really do a good job at reading signs and even understanding who you are.

Teachers,f7msqox,t1_f7mqdc9,1573872597.0,"I'm just giving credit to where credit is due! A lot of times in life teachers are the ones who are most often underappreciated and I appreciate what you do for your students and mainly why you went into this profession. We need more teachers who genuinely care about the students, who wants to work with problematic students and lastly teachers who have a vision and truly believe that regardless of how students are they can be successful someday. You'll be surprised that not all teachers truly believe their students will be successful. I saw it with my very eyes how I was treated compared to other students. I was an ace student, who dealt with various problems outside of school. I dealt with depression and other stuff. School was my sanctuary, it was my place for peace, but that couldn't be said for everyone. I saw some of my friends who didn't do as well and how they were looked as failures. Now, the problem isn't entirely on the teachers. I would say it has everything to do with how society see things. We've been so ingrained to just reward and focus on those who are doing well, but in reality the struggling students should be the ones that get the most attention. I was a good student despite all my problems, but my friends and other students who didn't do well often felt withdrawn because of lack of support and appreciation for what they do ,after all they were students as well.

What I am essentially saying is there is a big problem with today's education system. Specifically, with the difference in views of different students. We should view all students the same, but that is not the case! We should be more focal in teaching and actually caring if students actually learn. I think there is too much emphasis on ""grades"" and way too little emphasis on actual learning going on. Lastly, there should be more focus on the students who are struggling than rather more focus on students who are doing fine. These are just some of my thoughts. I don't why I went into all of that, sometimes my mind can wonder and I start to type whatever comes to my mind. Anyways, I appreciate teachers who genuinely care about students who are struggling. They need role models like you to give them hope! Sometimes a good teacher is the best role model! Good luck and wishing you all the best!"

Have a talk with her and see what she says. Is she hurt by your outburst? Does she now realize how mean she is? If she shows remorse then talk it over with her and try to save the relationship if you both truly really like each other despite her being always so mean. Lastly, you mention your best friend is a women, does your Girlfriend not like her? Does she have problems with that? I can't answer any of these questions.

Personally, i would argue that finding people attractive isn't sexual and doesn't have to do with anyone's marriage status, but being married and having a crush on someone is wrong! but who knows? he might have meant all of that as a joke... but still a careless way of saying it. It shouldn't have been said at all! If Dave didn't say any of this then OP wouldn't have told Claire and Claire wouldn't have known anything.

How can she file sexual harassment over something so small as the CFO saying ""She's pretty"" and that he has a schoolboy crush? That comment is meant as a joke and it has no intentions of it being sexual at all. Furthermore, Dave doesn't even interact with Claire...

How I see it is Claire is just causing trouble. Any reasonable, human being would understand what you meant when you told Claire that people do admire her and that she shouldn't worry about the future of dating. Also, it seems she's quick to bring up about her breakups and personal life. I'll advice to not engage with any personal conversations with her anymore.

The unfortunate part is now you might have damaged your friendship with Dave. He's the most innocent one here and your comment was also misinterpreted. The problem here is clearly Claire. STAY AWAY!"
offmychest,f7m9vcn,t3_dws8gx,1573857684.0,">I truly believe the genuine joy of celebrating love has been replaced by societal pressures to have the perfect Instagram wedding.

You hit the root of the problem and I couldn't have said it better! Society is really messing up as far as what we should value and what is really important. These days we have people who are so superficial and it seems everyone values all the wrong things.

Does Instagram worthy wedding photos change anything? It does absolutely nothing to have awesome pictures to post on Instagram. It doesn't change someone's life and yet people spend so much time and money just to show others how great their ""Wedding experience"" is. This isn't about hate or anything. This has everything to do with how our perception of things have changed. Sometimes, we really ought go back to the old days and value what is worthy of being valued.

Lastly, is there anyway you can rent a dress or find ways to cut your costs and still look amazing for the wedding? Explore some options if you really do want to attend the wedding, but not want to spend a fortune.

P.S. I am a millennial myself and I've always felt as if I never belonged! I hated how society is today and I am broke as hell too."
depression,f7lzeyn,t3_dwq600,1573851088.0,"Hey! I just wanted to come on here and say I can totally relate with you. I went to college and I did the same thing as you. I was suppose to be more social, make new friends, meet cool people, network and all of that college stuff but I did absolutely nothing even close to it. In fact, I've been such a failure to the point that I am graduating a semester late. I haven't had any energy for internships and nothing. I've wasted my whole 4 and half years of my life where I thought I should have been the most happy. Everyone seems to think that college is one of the best 4 years of someone's life, but in reality it isn't even close. I see so many people dreading college and they are miserable, although they do a better job of hiding it and working at it than me. 

At my worse points in life I didn't even go to class for a whole semester. I briefly showed up and just managed to do the bare minimum to pass. Thankfully attendance didn't matter. 

Ironic enough my semester ends exactly 1 month from now. By then, I can finally say I am done and work on my mental health. I still feel like a failure though, all the people at my school have full-time offers and they are working so hard and I am here working so hard to keep my head up and I have nothing to show for it. I can't go to an employer and say look I've been working hard and expect them to believe me. I have a mediocre gpa, bad extra-curriculars, spotty work history and you know what I realize that it is what it is.

I recently started to gather myself and keep myself positive. I've had thoughts of suicide every now and then and I realize death doesn't solve anything. So, even though I want to die, dying doesn't do anything. It' doesn't change my life for the better. The only way out of this is to get help and keep fighting. I'm sorry for  some of us having to go through life this hard. It really is hard, some days I wish I can go back in time and just change. Change everything about myself. Stop hating myself, stop putting myself down all the time, Just be at peace and be happy, but instead i'm here all miserable and messed up. Wishing you the best though!

Who even complains about people eating and the sounds they make while they eat?

Does she not consume food in her own office? Does she not make any noises herself when she eats? She is incredibly inconsiderate and a joke!

If HR actually makes this a big deal, just know how stupid this really is! Sounds like there is more to this then just ""she doesn't like me making sounds when I eat"", I think there has to be a reason she is acting this way.

&#x200B;

Lastly, you said that she went to you and talked to and wanted to force you not to eat in your office and that is incredibly wrong! Since you guys are the same rank she has no authority over you. In fact, no one has authority over what you eat and how you eat it. It is laughable to say ""This person is eating loudly, so I can't be productive"" who the fuck says that type of thing and has audacity to record it and report it to HR??

Now, I am imagining how she would react if on her way to work someone is eating chips next to her. Would she flip out and report that to HR as well?"

Think about how lonely everyone is out there in the world. Not everyone are in a relationship. Some people would love to be in one and here you have a guy cheating on you...and he doesn't even appreciate you. You need to make the right decision and find someone else. He's absolutely not worth it!"
relationship_advice,f775wf6,t1_f77449o,1573444867.0,"Wow, that's a significant amount of time. Then I must say he must be very pleased of you. Another big question to ask yourself is does he seem like the type to ever want to be in a relationship again? After all, he is paying money to see you and to spend time with you, but couldn't he do that by naturally finding someone he is interested in and get into a new relationship? Why is it that he likes to pay money to see you? Not that anything is wrong with this, but what I am eluding to is maybe he just wants to spend time with someone like you and likes the idea of not having to make any commitments, but can feel and enjoy the relationship aspect whenever he wants. This can be a possibility, but I do not know as much information as you do, but still these are good points to think about.

Lastly, the idea of a man paying an escort at his current age can be viewed as differently. It is neither positive or negative and from different viewpoints it can mean different things. Does he want and like only young women? Does he seem to be down to earth and genuinely a good human being? There a lot of people who are not always good people. Please consider if he's worth it and consider what you like about him. At your current age of 26, you can easily put yourself in a good position to find someone your age that is unmarried and your options are limitless. Why are you attracted to him? What does he have that other guys around your age don't have? Understand that you are very much likely at your peak age, and that he's approaching 40's and not in his peak anymore. You have the upper hand in finding dates and his options are limited.

These are all good questions to ask yourself and think about."

Now, liking you and wanting to be with you in a relationship are two things, but I think you can throw some hints that you love him and that you have feelings for him and see how he responds.

&#x200B;

Has he talked about his future and what he plans to do? Does he have kids? All of these are important questions to think about as well. I think at the end of the day you have absolutely nothing to lose. If your feelings for him are overwhelming you the best thing to do is to weigh your options and go for it. What's the worse to come of it? He might surprisingly say yes and reciprocate your feelings or he will say it's too soon and he'll apologize. Either way knowing how he feels is knowing the truth is definitely worth the risk!

As you said in the edit section his wife passed away in an accident just 3 years ago, life isn't forever. We may never know when our day will come. I will say take the risk and tell him.

I will assume that he might have gotten the hint that you have feelings for him by spending time with him and not charging him any money. Maybe, he is in the similar boat as you and feels the same for you, but doesn't know how to tell you. Either way, someone has to speak to see where it goes. Good luck :)!

Lastly, since his wife passed away tragically just 3 years ago, it does complicate things a little bit. Perhaps, he's still mourning her death, or maybe because of the timing he might not be ready for a relationship. I am just mentioning some relevant points to consider.

Overall, from your post it seems he really does enjoy spending time with you, but I can't tell for certain how he would respond if you tell him that you have feelings for him. Another good point to consider is, why is he seeing you? Does he have other escorts/girls that he is seeing? Also, don't give up your career for someone. Be you, and if he genuinely cares and have feelings for you your career shouldn't matter to him as long as you separate your emotions with your clients from emotions with him.

After all, he's been taking drugs and who knows how he is mentally. You would also want to think about the actions he might take knowing his wife is seeing another man. Prison is a rough place and it wears people down. The last thing you want is for Alex to do something crazy. In prison, people are not themselves and breaking such a bad news can cause some problems. Also, do Alex even care to be with his wife when he gets out? Like you said he abandoned her, maybe he doesn't even care anymore?

You said he has a history of bad relationships, divorce, drugs so I would say he is not a very stable person mentally and physically. All of these points must be considered before you tell Alex.

&#x200B;

From Alex's wife standpoint you would imagine it feels rough to have kids with no father figure and he's never around. I don't blame her that she is seeing someone. Human beings can only take so much pain and pressure. Maybe it is good for her to see this new man. I don't know the specifics but this is a testy and hard decision to make. I think given the information you gave me I will not tell Alex about this unless I know he is mentally well and prepared for the aftermath. Who knows how he might take it?

After prison, does he plan to clean himself up and live life normally? Does he talk about wanting to live normally and go back to his family or does he continue to want to do drugs and bounce around? All of these points are important. Please consider all of them before you make the decision."

The other person claims his girlfriend legit wears the same type of outfit every single day or just to everywhere and even to formal events. That too me is a bit extreme. Whether that is true or not, and to what extent I don't know, but that is a bit unusual if I must say. Now,  I don't have problems with how people dress. In all honesty, I want people to feel comfortable in whatever they wear. I'm from the big apple and people dress whatever way they like, and I've never questioned and cared to think of it much. How you dress should empower your image and make you feel good. How others see it doesn't matter. If you look cute in your t-shirts and shorts/sweats that's more power to you and I'm happy to hear that!

Lastly, I think somethings don't need to be communicated. It is expected that if the other person is wearing a suit then his girlfriend should wear something to match his formality. That is just my belief, whether people agree on that or not it doesn't bother me. Again, I'm just trying to help people out. In no way am I feeling a certain way about anything here.

Understand that you will be dressed formal while there will be other diners who are dressed in T-shirts and jeans. This is more of a pairing issue then a dressing issue in my personal opinion. If you wore a suit and tie, then I suppose you expected her to wear a dress and heels, but understand that in your given example it is not necessarily needed to dress ""formal"" to a dinner at a restaurant. All she has to dress is ""presentable"" and it is good that she didn't wear her crop top because that would be showing too much.

&#x200B;

Now on to the actual problem. Well, it really depends if it is a deal breaker. I think people should dress for the occasion always and most of the time I don't see what is wrong with the usual leggings, tennis shoes and a t-shirt. Now, does she wear these type of things to a formal event? If she doesn't, then I don't see the problem to be that big.

&#x200B;

Maybe, get her something nice to wear or take her on a date and tell her the dress code and see what she shows up with. That should give you an idea of how big a problem this is.

Everything went downhill after my early years of high school. I guess I can say I peaked early. From middle school to early high school I was very well liked. Girls thought I was cute, I played sports, I was taller than everyone, but like we all know the drawback of this is that I stopped growing since my early high school years. I hit puberty early, so I peaked early, but I paid the price. Eventually, everyone got taller than me, bigger than me and everything I felt special about myself went away. That combined with a messy life at home and constant arguments with my parents started my spiral into depression. It's been years now and I've still been trying to recover. Some days I do wish I can just die, but I realize I have to keep living. Dying doesn't solve anything, so long i'm alive I can still have the chance of turning this all around.

depression,f70k8lx,t3_dtpy4e,1573329300.0,"I wish sometimes it would be that easy, but the longer I've been depressed the more I realize that I have to just keep on going and that living is absolutely worth more than dying. The reason for this is so long you are alive there is still chance of you turning all of this around. Everyone go through up and downs and it is tough, but if you die you become nothing. When you die you will rot and you will be shit. That is worse than feeling like shit and trying to push through. So, try to push through. Trust me, I think life will get better in one way or another. To those who are depressed they need to fight and they need to keep living! That is the only way.

I use to feel like shit everyday and wanted to die everyday as well. Now, I realize the world isn't as perfect as I once thought it was. Everyone's going through stuff, and to those who are depressed it is no different.

I'm currently recovering from all this, and honestly the best advice is to have a positive outlook on life. Think about your potential and just move forward. Stop being scared and start taking risks. Just realize that humans only live to around 80 years old. Don't live with regrets, own up to yourself and do what the fuck you want! Sorry for the cursing, but we depressed people are not inferior to everyone else. We are in fact stronger and more capable! If we can go through life and suffer and still live then we really are stronger than the average!"

Maybe he is a victim of bullying because of these fillings and someone wanted to make him feel better by telling him that fillings are cool? and..now he actually really believes that fillings are good for him? Not sure, but that is super weird!"
lonely,f6xp9ti,t3_dtdjta,1573254790.0,"I can relate with you and i'm 23 and honestly I don't think many people realize what it really means to have a friend. If those people you invite out all the time and throw parties for don't even invite you out then are they really your friend? Good friends have each others back all the time and they genuinely enjoy to spend time with one another. It seems like most of your so called friends are just people you ""know"" and nothing more.

&#x200B;

Everyone's got a lot of people they ""know"", true friends are very rare. True friends are friends that have your back even if they aren't always around. People who genuinely want the best for you and your well being are you true friends. I guess it is safe to say most of those people don't really care about you. They just like to party and go out and have a good time... nothing more than that i guess. Lastly, that is fine but yeah they aren't your true friends."
lonely,etvgb51,t1_etv46x8,1563234650.0,"Yeah! Definitely give it a try. Emu Paradise is a great place for emulators and roms. N64 golden eye is great, road rash and among other great games :). Enjoys!"
lonely,ettkw4d,t1_ettkjtu,1563185530.0,Yeah those older games are definitely best played on a N64 emulator. The emulator allows the game to be played on the pc. You can even set up a controller and use that to play instead of keyboards. It's pretty fun :). there are quite a few n64 emulators online as well as the n64 game roms. Emu paradise is heaven for emulators and roms. super cool place to check out! Heavily recommend :)
lonely,ettjhjw,t1_ettivb9,1563183344.0,"Yeah, I tried quite a few and it's hard to motivate me these days. Always kind of tired and just never in the mood. But I love MMO's! Runescape and world of warcraft were super cool. I heard World of warcraft vanilla is coming. Might give a try and relive the old days :)"
lonely,ettjf88,t1_ettivca,1563183246.0,You too! I'm happy to find that there are others out there experiencing same problems as me and i'm not alone. We need to just get through it :)!
lonely,ettjd5b,t1_ett9wr1,1563183161.0,"Yeah, I was at a point like that as well. Just binge watching shows after shows and rewatching things just for the sake of it. Eventually I got tired and just stopped watching. I would stay up all night watching shows and its pretty bad for the health"
lonely,ettjami,t1_ettif6p,1563183051.0,"Oh yeah man I played some n64 goldeneye lately and that really made me kind of enjoy the older games. Although, it's not like great hd graphics or anything but its a hella fun and good game. emulators are cool as well. I never grew up in the n64 age so those games are very foreign to me, but I can appreciate them because they really are cool and they are foundations of what a lot of games are today."
lonely,ettiluw,t1_etthc4i,1563181972.0,"Man I was like that for some time as well. Just the thought of building a nice machine and then gaming on it sounds amazing and awesome , but then once you get the custom built PC reality hits hard. There aren't many that fun games and games are no fun without friends :(. The best games are played with friends and it holds true till this day. And yeah its tough man. Rock bottom is hard. I barely sleep well and when I wake up the day is pretty much over. I'm wishing you the best though. :)"
lonely,ettgkrf,t1_ettbebu,1563178743.0,"Lol! but it is a kids game haha i believe its 13+. Anyways, yeah its a cool game. I got into it back in the day when all the kids would go to the library and spend time gaming on the library comps. I saw a lot of kids playing so i started. Never looked back since :)"
lonely,ettgecc,t1_ettbsb1,1563178472.0,"Those games are awesome! I use to play some of those games you mentioned as well. As we all get older I think just the stress of life and everything going on kind of changes the person we use to be. I use to game heavy back in my high school days. Then went to college and gamed a fair bit cause I was always an introvert. I hung out but never really had my group of friends. Once I was done with college, work and everything else took a lot of my time so I couldn't game as much no more but its all good. I kinda hated my job so I Left that job and now its the summer and i'm trying to enjoy it, but I realize how truly lonely I really am."
lonely,ettaquf,t1_ett9jou,1563170965.0,"I played a good bit of league, then i tried diablo, then i went back to one of my childhood games called OSRS. and so far that is about all I play. I don't play as much anymore :(. I just wake up tired everyday and hardly have any energy left"
lonely,ett97nl,t1_ett931f,1563169180.0,Yeah I feel the same way. I just don't feel motivated to play games or even play well. Sometimes I will do bad in the game and get mad. It's the summer and everyone is out partying and enjoying life and here I am all alone :(. It happens. I hope everything turns around for all of us who are lonely.
