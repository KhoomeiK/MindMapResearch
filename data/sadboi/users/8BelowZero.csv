Especially not off chlorobutanol, it fucks up your liver and I would rather stay healthy. I have a small collection of things I've made. If I wanted to get high I'd just buy weed, its less trouble and decriminalized (but not fully legal) where I live. I don't want to get high, I just think these are cool to make and really interesting chemicals. I am taking a chemistry class but we don't do much interesting stuff. My chemistry teacher helps me figure out how to do the reactions I do at home. I'm not just throwing chemicals together."

The article seems to use some emotional wording, like where it compares the IQ loss to that of lead exposure, and it would be much better to read the actual study itself as an article ""dumbing it down"" for the average person doesn't necessarily have all the data.

For the record I don't want to antagonize you or anything like that, sorry if I came off that way.

I have limited time right now but here is a study I found. I can find more if you are open, if not that is fine.
