>i think while these solutions work, they have flaws. social stigma and internalized homophobia lead many people to reject transsexuals.

That's societal influence. If people aren't accepted by society their suicide levels are the sames pre transition, if they transition and are accepted suicide levels go down to cis levels. Society has impacted how trans people are seen and how we see ourselves. It is difficult to change society, but all we need is for people to leave us alone and let us live how we want. I don't want to give up just because social stigma exists and I haven't let it stop me. 

>it’s very possible that instead of humoring and embracing the internalized identity, we should try to erase it. i believe we should try to get these people to accept themselves as their biological sex.

I will never go back to living as a woman. Being trans is a neurological/ endocrine disorder and gender dysphoria is a symptom of that. The brain is given the wrong body map because of hormone imbalances in the womb and potentially other genetic side effects. The male brain is meant to run on testosterone and the female on estrogen. This is one of the reasons puberty is so bad. You see the same thing happen to cis people who have endocrine problems. Cis people can also get gender dysphoria. We don't try to convince them to live with what happened to me but try to restore their body to what it was supposed to be. Detransitoners are the first people who come to mind. If you aren't medically trans, transition will induce dysphoria. That isn't mental anymore, that a physical biologic effect. Giving the wrong hormones to someone has terrific consequences. 

The issue with your statement is that you assume it is purely a mental disorder. Gender dysphoria is but it still arises from a neurological disorder so not amount of therapy can change the truth that the brain was set to run on different hormones and set up for a different body. If erasing the identity was possible many people would have just done instead. 

I understand that would be ideal and we could all just move on. Your heart is in the right place. 

>they can never feel normal or at peace.

I'm a year and a half in roughly and I can tell you the closest I ever came to a religious experience was taking testosterone for the first time. It was like a horrible curse has been lifted and was free to think and do as i will. Other people have similar feelings and will defend their tradition greatly for that reason. 

> transsexuals are very far from being normalized

No, but I'm still gonna fight for the future trans people who will be born one day. I think we both agree that progress is possible.

>gender dysphoria has a lot in common with minor schizophrenia, as both afflictions interfere with the sufferer’s perception of objective reality. gender dysphoria also often lays hand in hand with intense depression. i think the people with dysphoria should be open to treatment, not with surgery and hormones, but with therapy and self acceptance.

I'm fully aware of my female autonomy. I know how I come off. Schizophrenic people do not have that ability nor do anti psychotics work. If I was delusional I
 wouldn't have dysphoria because I would think I had the male body parts too. The objective reality is I have female reproductive organs  and I'll never have the male ones in the way I want but my brain is male. You can't change the brain physically to anticipate the female body I have so I have to change my body.

It is not an easy decision to make but it is an absolutely amazing one for many people. 

>sex and gender are engrained within our psychology and behavior as a species.

I find myself in partial agreement. Gender is important socially and we are a social species. Sex is important too. MY sex is mixed rn because my hormonal and brain sex are male but my reproductive and chromosomal are female. Which one wins?  Trans people are a natural accident. Of course our switch gender brains would be extremely noticeable in such a highly social species. 

This goes into sex too ( I'm assuming). I personally think we are too hung up on all of that. Some people are more attracted to certain aspects of the man or women role and some people are more attracted to a certain type of man or woman because they want a certain future or have preference. That's totally fine. However we shouldn't be policing if a man is gay if he sleeps with a transwoman. Gay men like transmen, not transwoman. That should give you your answer for that. 

> i just want them to accept themselves and be the best version of them they can be.

That's what transition did to me. Everyone I have met after starting to transition has commented on how successful I've become.  I used this idea to prove to family who weren't sure that I should transition that it was ultimately the best idea.

A lot of people would see quitting transition or refusing to try it as giving up. Some people have a hard time passing and society can be extremely rough to people who don't pass.

>What is the source of the downfall?

I'm going to use an example I'm more familiar with. Let's talk ADHD. I have it and I spend time in some of the communities. A support group at first is good. It helps people talk about their issues related to the condition without coddling them. The group is small and intimate enough that people can actually discuss their view points and criticize how a member handled something while telling them how to avoid it in the future. 

When the group becomes too large it is much harder for an individual to speak. The group slowly turns into defending itself from the outside rather than using each other to learn how to manage themselves in the outside because that discussion is difficult to have if even one person has a strong emotional response to the suggestion. 

>What is the cause of the doom?

Human emotion, lack of education around it, human instinct to be in groups. Most people aren't taught how to handle their emotions at all. Something can make you upset but isn't bad or a personnel attack. The individual gets drowned out by people saying they didn't like something. A little pathos in an argument can bring everything together but a whole argument made out of it impulsively is meaningless. 

Overall, a strong emotional response to something. Alternatively, being taught something and totally unwilling to let it go even if it is proven wrong. In that case you would seek people out like you who don't act for you to change so you are ""safe"" in that group."

The Greeks were gay and so were the Romans during their height. Their sexuality was based more on who was dominant or submissive though.

I understand the rhetoric. When it comes to education I agree. The system isn't built for understanding only for repetition. Most people aren't even taught how to be media literate. The issue is nobody knows if they are faking it so you got a bunch of people talking about things they think they understand ( Christianity, immigration, medicine, economics, psychology, sociology, philosophy, transgender science). In my perfect world I would mix the idea of functional academic in special education with mainstream academics and utilize problem solving lessons that involve higher level social group work over testing. It would accommodate those who have minor learning disabilities way better as well. You can even start this as young as kindergarten. The last great american school system change was moving from one room schools to the large schools we see today.

Ah, yeah. Education is a train wreck currently. I'm not really going to argue with you there. I'm up for a revamp of something. I wouldn't call it evil so much as it is simple and ineffective. The system allows people through if they know how to work it. The dynasties of China did better when they had their difficult tests of scholars but I believe a lot of their tests were based on morals. An interesting thought. I think schools should teach the concept of ethics. Would you say that a system that removes choice would be less evil based on the fact that during good times the consequences wouldn't be so bad? During the bad times the bad parts of that system would be exacerbated. I would still say the human nature to game the system is what's evil rather than the system.

I hold male/female pedophiles in the same regard. A pedophile is a pedophile. They are opportunistic and go after children who are vulnerable. Reporting is always going to be skewed because most people don't report their assault. There are probably way more female pedophiles then we know. I totally agree with you on that one. But what are you saying suggests that heterosexual women have more hidden problems. I only brought up women because in the abstract you sent me it mentioned measuring homosexual women predators.  
It seems that heterosexual men as more of an issue a threat to women that homosexual women anyway so it doesn't really matter. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3912575/

If you want to address the abuse among lgbt children then I'm more than willing to get into it. This article goes into why there are high rates of sexual abuse among lgbt children and most of it seems to do with either gender expression, social isolation ( easier target), or a type of hierarchy ( wanting to keep the lgbt family member/ person below you in status). Frankly speaking, lgbt kids have experienced a lot of trauma because they are easier targets. This fits into the idea that pedophiles are opportunistic more than anything else. 

I'm just trying to make sense of the data you gave me. This is the best I could come up with in regards to that. I personally care more about the victims and what we can do to prevent assaults like this. All I care about with the perpetrators is that we put as many as possible into prison. 

Do you think people are protecting gay predators from justice? I can assure you nobody in the LGBT community wants to see that happen, most would probably volunteer themselves to drive the pedophile straight to jail."

This could be a big deal or it means they worded a question wrong. I can't check them. Also if they are the ONLY people who have reported this and people can't replicate their numbers, then they did something wrong. I thinking looking into the subject is probably good, but that sentence matters a lot. Tread lightly. 

This article does not say why this might be the case. Why are these numbers like this? Is their a societal reason? Is it because gay children are often more vulnerable in some way?

This is more of a overview on everything. It seems that most children you are assaulted/molested are girls. around 15-20 %. Boys are molested at about 8 %. Men make up most the pedophile population.  Women make up a small fraction and they contribute to 6% of female offenses and around 40 % for male offenses. That means men are doing the rest. 

Pedophiles are opportunistic most of the time. Ascribing a sexuality like a tangent. It also seems based on these numbers that it can be implied that it is mostly heterosexual men assaulting children. However, I'm not going to go around claiming all hetero sexual men are rapists.

There is no amendment that literally says that. But there are some that apply to the situation. I like the 14th and 9th most for this. Of course there's a huge debate on the wording. I understand that this is more of a policy argument than a philosophical one.

> I think the greatest misrepresentation of this argument is that the mother is the only stakeholder in this whole thing. I would argue that there's three: the fetus, the mother, and the father. No I don't think they all have equal stake, that would be absurd. 

I agree. I think people realize that the fetus has a lot at stake. But I also don't really consider that relevant to the argument about body autonomy. It just seems like it could fit in the importance of life discussion. People do forget the father in all of this. I have a few opinions on why but sexism does affect both men and women. Not in the same way or equally, but it still does. I don't think another person should have the final say in what someone else does with their body.

> But I've always been a bit turned off by the ""no uterus no opinion"" argument. 

I think this comes from a place of frustration for a lot of women/ or people who have the parts to have a baby. I don't like it being used to shut down a discussion. Cis men will never truly understand the experience so I get where women are coming from, but the idea of my baby being aborted scares me a lot too. I think people need to open themselves up to talking to men about this particular anxiety. Everyone has pre packaged reactions for everything now, it is very tiring. 

>I'd argue that such a fear is actually the fundamental root of conservatism. That said, as far as I'm concerned the only job the federal government has and the only arena it should have power is in safeguarding the rights of its citizens. In this case, the person-hood of the fetus suddenly becomes very very important since we generally believe that people have a right to life 

I grew up conservative and I have lived in both New York and Alaska, Some ideas have stuck around for sure. I think this is getting to the root of my fear with government though. I will say that a fetus has the potential to be a person if nature doesn't decide anything different. "" The right to life"" is way too vague for me. The government could use that for organ removals that I was talking about before. What if somebody is brain dead, they can say that someone else has a right to live and take those organs even if the family wants to keep them hooked up. What if I'm a match with someone and they need one of my kidneys to stay alive? Can the government use right to life to legally make me give up my kidney? If we are using person-hood as the place where someone has a right to life, then we need to take everyone else into account too. I understand this is very slippery slope, but I can see somebody reasonably taking that idea to get court and passing laws using that idea. People would get behind that really fast if they can guarantee that if they get sick they have a better chance of getting better.

I think people miss that this isn't a clear scientific argument but a more philosophical/ role of the government. Many animal species self abort, but normally when the environment is unstable. Human females are actually oddly disadvantaged in that they can't induce it themselves naturally. I would argue that drive to remove a baby because conditions are unstable is what drives a lot abortions to happen. I do think providing better sex education, contraceptives, free childcare, and other pro family policies would go a long way to actually significantly reducing abortions. 

A little tangent there, but I think this is only part of the argument anyway. It doesn't really start and stop at when the embryo gets person-hood because you really can't argue against the potential for human life. I think this leads to confusion in this debate which make people ill prepared to handle it. The real counter to this that, especially with you opinion on it, the government is taking control of someone's organs and forcing them to use it in a certain way. The baby is using the uterus to survive. The government telling somebody how to use their organs is a major infringement on amendment rights. Whatever power the government gets, it tends to keep and expand on. I am uncomfortable with the implications. Are they going to start taking all healthy organs from those who have died? I like the idea but what happens with religious people who can't have their organs removed after they die? Does their right to their religion/ convenience to keep organs they don't need outweigh someone else's right to live?  

I don't see many pro life people really confronting this either. They just boil it down to consequence free sex. That's a fun strawman for sure.

Doesn't it get boring? This is a real question. Is this more a meme thing or do people think they are being funny?
askaconservative,fphyrav,t1_fpg59nl,1588630312.0,"One of the conservative ideas I totally agree with is that people need a sense of community. While that exists for some people, the idea of liberalism was taken too literally. Having individual rights doesn't mean you are an island. I think people confuse economic independence to be the only way to achieve success and we undervalue social success.  Ideally, someone should have both."
asktransgender,fphxvdf,t3_gd9zvo,1588629826.0,Being anonymous gives people too much free reign to say whatever they want. In real life people are much more tame and open to listen to you. I'm speaking about strangers mostly though. I had some family members who were interested immediately and wanted to talk about it. Some I'm still working on
askaconservative,fphrym7,t1_fpgc3kj,1588626716.0,"There are certain conservative cultures that have a place for trans masculine or feminine people ( European cultures included). I don't think that will change your mind, but it is interesting to see how different conservative cultures decide what is and isn't acceptable."
askaconservative,fphrnxv,t1_fpg9xpc,1588626561.0,"We treat different mental illness's differently. A stupid sentence, but it fits. I get that from the outside it looks terrifying and putting yourself in their position probably freaks you out a little. That's a little taste of what gender dysphoria feels like. Cis people can get gender dysphoria too. Not enough people realize that."
askaconservative,fphr58g,t3_gdin44,1588626285.0,"Most people don't understand their political beliefs enough to properly defend themselves. I fight with people on the right and left and the strategy is the same, just show you are educated on what you are talking about if you can. If you aren't as educated, then educate yourself and come back. I actually find a good faith argument is better at getting ideas crossed if you want to change minds."

askaconservative,fphqfk5,t3_gdcwrn,1588625911.0,"I see a lot of bad information in this thread. I'm FTM and I don't get offended easily. If somebody wants to talk in good faith, I'm open. I will say a few things right out of the gate that a law forcing someone to use the right pronouns is a bad idea. Being trans is more a neurological/ endocrine issue, gender dysphoria is just along for the ride ( cis people can accidentally give themselves GD). You don't have to like the idea of trans people, I have no problem with people not liking it. My issue is when people use bad information against trans people and make it my problem."
askaconservative,fphp2gf,t1_fpgjw4h,1588625197.0,Making it a law is overboard. That's ridiculous. I think that it is unprofessional and creates a hostile work environment if you don't address someone with the right pronouns and especially if you use the wrong name. It is up to the business on how to handle that though.
askaconservative,fpeqa2e,t1_fpc6o5w,1588552654.0,"Fair, most aren't. Media tends to herd people into thinking a certain way and if you find a nice echo chamber you are in for life or at least a long time. Most people are too afraid of looking into other ideas because their own beliefs are built on shaky ground. I could talk about this for a long time, I'm super interested in how people develop their ideas."
askaconservative,fpan34h,t1_fpalby5,1588451568.0,"Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, with other people being potential Deists. Considering how the government was made, it suggests that it was heavily influenced by the enlightenment. I will admit that I give extremely confused when people want to say this is a Christian nation. It was important during America's creation, many people moved to the 13 colonies to escape religious prosecution. But the government itself was clearly built separately from any religion. "" Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is extremely close to copying John Locke's "" Life, liberty, and happiness"" . He was also the man who came up with the concept of natural rights. 

It just seems to me that changing America into an official christian country would be making America into something it isn't and never was. You are saying you wanted it to be there to start with but that create a much different history and vision than the one we have today."
asktransgender,fpalxzb,t3_gc369o,1588450892.0,Dysphoria is a bunch of boiling water that exists within and around you. You have lived with this boiling water your whole life and don't realize you are boiling while everyone else is at room temperature. Slowly you can start to remove yourself from it and as soon as you realize you don't need to live like that anymore you can't live in that water. Some parts of you might still be in it and it can seem like it hurts more because parts of you aren't boiling anymore.
askaconservative,fpakr0c,t1_fp9ne6m,1588450189.0,">Forgetting to mention that all these movements were fundamentally nationalist too, with this larger picture taken into account

That's actually an incredibly fascinating point that most people probably wouldn't consider or know how to react to. However, I think that not wanting to be controlled by a foreign power is different than the type of nationalism that most people think of when they hear the word. It's a bit more nuanced/complicated than most people think."
