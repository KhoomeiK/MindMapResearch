funny,fpin445,t1_fpimhc4,1588644374.0,"I‚Äôm not graduated from college yet (only 3 classes left thankfully) so I lack a lot of experience. I‚Äôm sure in a couple years I could better answer your question, haha. The way I understand it in the most basic way is that TR focuses on leisure experiences. My teachers would be so disappointed right now hahaha."
funny,fpilvkk,t1_fpil7t2,1588643620.0,We don‚Äôt have the same schooling; I only have to complete an undergraduate degree and pass a test for a certification. So I suppose the first difference is that OTs get paid more and have a more extensive education. OTs‚Äô goal is usually to provide services to help the person get back to being able to perform everyday essential tasks. A rec therapist works on the client‚Äôs overall quality of life and try to assist people in leisure activities.
funny,fpikvoe,t1_fpijxg5,1588643026.0,"So we aren‚Äôt physical therapists in any way, but yeah we kind of do work alongside them! In a hospital setting the PTs would do their thing with the patient and a Rec Therapist would be a separate session. We mostly play games and try to do fun activities instead of exercises and such. We‚Äôre mostly used in retirement facilities, mental health facilities, and parks and recreation but there are CTRS‚Äôs (Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist) in a lot of clinical settings. 

Hope that makes sense and gives you a little insight!"

Anxiety,f9ffhd1,t3_e4v7kf,1575269597.0,If you‚Äôre in high school I would say tell the nurse ahead of time what you‚Äôre dealing with and explain you need to leave class sometimes but you‚Äôre worried about being marked absent. Maybe they can talk to your teacher for you to let them know. Usually if teachers know what‚Äôs going on they‚Äôre very understanding. But if you‚Äôre in college you should go to your schools accessibility office! They have a lot of different ways to help with these situations. Hope this helped üòå
