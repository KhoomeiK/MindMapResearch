Likewise, however, ""You will never find someone"" isn't a truth either, but an overly bleak outlook that, understandably, was probably formed after years of hardship and rejection. The real truth is the one thing that every single human being hates saying: ""Maybe, I dunno, no guarantee, but, like, yeah, maybe, if you try hard enough and everything works out.""

AskReddit,fp5efva,t1_fp52nl7,1588326311.0,"People have a tendency to personify things around them, including the universe itself. There's a reason why the earliest religions tended towards ""The sun is ALIVE and it CARES and PROTECTS US"" instead of ""The Universe is a vast, uncaring void where random stuff happens that we happen to exist in."" When you're constantly living with the sobering reality of something horrible possibly happening to you at any second that is beyond your power to stop, especially when the likelihood of said thing is high (ie. Fighting for your life in the wild every day, living in a terrible low-income area, frequent abuse, fighting in a war, etc.) humans kind of HAVE to believe in superstitions and misconceptions and religion of some kind, because sometimes the world is so scary that literally the only way your brain can process it is through the faith that it will be alright in the end so long as you do everything ""right"", when that is in fact not the case at all and everything is just a bunch of luck.   


I'm very science-driven, and used to be a full-blown atheist, but as I have gone through more and more harrowing experiences as I have grown up, I have found it harder and harder to not believe in a God or gods, not because I need them to explain the way the world works, but because it is comforting, even though I logically know everything is just a bunch of atoms floating around. It helps you get through stuff sometimes and cope with every day life, because let's be honest, humans weren't built to handle some of the shit out there.   


The trouble comes when people are so deep into it that they don't want to break from their beliefs for even a second, like when they are actually wholeheartedly convinced that the universe cares about THEM and THEY are right and everybody else is WRONG and GOD WANTS ME TO blah blah blah and they start getting delusional and forcing everybody to go along with it."

Tbh I'm mostly bothered about the fact that politics in America has come down to voting for an old dementia-ridden racist vs a more endearing and arguably less dangerous old dementia-ridden racist, either of which their party will go to the ends of the Earth to promote, no matter their actions.

The only difference is while the Republicans will openly flaunt Trump's behavior because they know their voters don't give a shit, the Democrats will pull any and all strings they need to to cover it up and contribute to their ""good guy"" image, then just ignore it until it goes away when they can't cover it up any longer. Republicans are that asshole who punches you in the face, Democrats are that asshole who will hire a guy to punch you in the face and then gaslight you and say they never had anything to do with it.

Anybody, literally ANYBODY else that was in the primaries and I would have no problem just checking that box and moving on, but Biden is the ONE guy that really makes me uncomfortable checking his name on a ballot even though I logically know he's the better choice over the other asshat. Either Trump wins and everywhere is royally fucked, Biden wins and international relations get better but America is fucked but slightly less so, or Biden wins and happens to maybe pick a good VP who succeeds him and can actually fix some things. Obviously Biden is the better one to choose, but as a sexual abuse survivor AND a survivor of police brutality, voting for anyone who I know has done the things the either of them have or approved of the things either of them have approved of gives me... not a very good feeling. It's like choosing whether to release Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer from prison, like Ted Bundy killed a LOT more people, but goddamn it, I am NOT going to feel good about letting either one roam around free, and no matter which way it turns out I'm not going to feel safe wherever they are for a long, long time. I hope things improve, I really do, but Biden or Trump, rich racist assholes aren't going to give up power in America until it's pried from their cold, dead hands and until that happens things are only going to get worse, whether slower or quicker. So, I'm checking my ballot box to hope for the slower option, getting my passport and moving as far away from all this bullshit as possible as soon as the election cycle is over, my friend. Sayonara.

tl;dr I totally see your point and that is why I am voting for Biden, because he would be an improvement in some very important areas, but even though he is not as bad on paper I really, REALLY don't like it, and no matter what boxes I check on the ballot I will feel shitty about it for years and all of my hope for this country is gone so I'm bailing.

R3: Same deal here, but a bit closer. Vader at this time is more cemented in the dark side than he is oncr Luke starts making him second-guess his actions, but at the end of the day he is Palpatine's puppet and if Palpatine just let up with all the dark side stuff and undid some of the shitty stuff he did to Vader it would be pretty easy, even without help.

The only one with a good shot I could see helping is Qui-Gon, but I still don't think he could do it.

Bonus: Yoda takes this one. In The Clone Wars we see that even Yoda struggles with the dark side, whereas Palpatine is literally a psychopath. Future Yoda could play on past Yoda's insecurities to turn him, but Future Palpatine would have nothing to ""bribe"" past Palpatine with when it comes to the light side."

People, for the love of God, buy the old stuff. After working there, I only get used/vintage things. You'd think they would be worse because they're ""worn in"", but no, they're better. Some of this furniture has survived 30+ years of use relatively unscathed and can easily go 30 more, as compared to some of the ""new"" stuff which I would not sell to my worst enemy and about half the time I am more than certain probably broke on their way home in the truck. Good new stuff exists, it's just ungodly expensive because wages haven't kept up with inflation. That $200 used bookcase from 1935 is equivalent to a $2000 new bookcase today.

Bitch it isn't a fucking insult, they just don't want to sleep with you, God. It's like the LGBT version of a ""nice guy"" who feels entitled to sex. Sometimes it seems like some allos, no matter their orientation or identity, literally cannot imagine someone not thinking about sex 24/7, and they weaponize tolerance like ""Oh you don't wanna have sex with me!? I guess you're a bIgOt"" and then whatever community they identify with covers for them to try to save face and when anybody points it out they've ""internalized their oppression"". I stopped going to LGBT places or trying to make friends in the community because of stuff like what you've described.

You did nothing wrong. Society as a whole as well as the LGBT community are terrible with sexual violence, as we all can attest, and honestly I think a lot of them just don't like looking in a mirror so they pretend we don't exist. It really kills me, because I would like a little safe space for myself, but many people treat LGBT spaces, parades, etc as no-questions-asked hookup spots, and it literally ruins it for me."

worldnews,fnnalsr,t1_fnkoxau,1587088053.0,"I see your logic when it comes to brick and mortar stores, but I really don't think anybody is worrying about monopolies right now. People are more in the mindset right now of ""How do I pay my rent/bills, feed and clothe my family, get the supplies I need, keep from going insane during all this, etc."" and if people can't get what they want and need for an extended period of time either in person or online they will start to just take it. Fining online retailers/making government-deemed non-essential items super hard to find and get both in-person AND online will only continue to put even more stress on people everywhere. Some sort of supply line has to stay open, online or otherwise, and I and a lot of other people don't give a shit where it comes from or whether it creates a monopoly or not as long as it is there. There are plenty of other routes around this (Stores being pick-up only to minimize people in the store, making sure stores follow distancing guidelines amongst employees, etc.), and as usual, many governments choose the most heavy-handed option of ""fine big company (But not really lol because they can just absorb the cost easily)"".

Now I don't like Wal-Mart or Amazon, I think huge companies like them are leeches on the economy of the world, but right now, RIGHT NOW, I don't give a shit about economics. I and many other people are worrying how we will survive TODAY, and they don't need another roadblock making that even harder than it already is. Absolutely every step within reason should be taken to preserve people's safety, but people also need to be able to get shit or it will just become pandemonium overnight, and by far the safest way that has been revealed thus far for that to happen is by online retailers and brick and mortar shops working together. See how well social distancing works when a mob of people are rushing in through a 5'x5' broken Wal-Mart window to raid the store and take everything inside."
WritingPrompts,fnn3j8k,t3_g2g541,1587083640.0,"""I mean they even outlawed eating meat! What the hell is that about, people should be able to choose what they put on their plates! I'm not gonna subsist off of... broccoli and nutrient bars!"" General MacArthur yelled, as he always did.

""Yes, YES. EXACTLY!"" Grand Warrior Ku'Gorosh exclaimed, ""A-And blood combat! They outlawed blood combat, can you believe that!? How in the WORLD is anyone supposed to settle a dispute!?""

The First Annual Thoran/Human Peace Banquet was going well, much better than the Human Leading Council had expected. General MacArthur was usually horrible with these sorts of things, and had in fact nearly singlehandedly destroyed Humanity's chances of joining the Galactic Federation five years prior. 

Despite that, his reputation as a great warrior and strategist was undeniable, and when he, in his now infamous Earthwide Address of 2354, said the Federation was ""A bunch of do-nothing, limp-twisted pussies who'll roll over for the first extra-galactic warlord that comes their way,"" and that they were ""The death of Humanity as we know it that will make us sacrifice everything we are over some false promise of eternal peace,"" they were inclined to believe him. 

After all, the last time the Council didn't listen to his advice, Jupiter still existed. They weren't about to make THAT mistake again.

Despite The Council's confidence in MacArthur, though, the galaxy as a whole deemed this decision a very bad move. Except, of course, for the Thorans.

""What is he doing?"" Grand Chairman Honda muttered under his breath as MacArthur got up onto the table and took Ku'Gorosh's hand.

""I believe he is showing them Greco-Roman wrestling, sir,"" Representative Phillips responded as MacArthur slammed Ku'Gorosh into the mashed potatoes. The room erupted with raucous cheers.

""And you say this stuff is made from a root!? Which you grind up and mix with fermented milk from the teet of a great beast and crushed sodium rocks!?"" Ku'Gorosh exclaimed as he licked some of the mashed potato goop off of his face.

""Yeah, basically. Now hold still, this one's called a reverse cradle."" MacArthur responded.

""Cradle!? You too train your children in combat?"" Ku'Gorosh asked as MacArthur wraped his arm around his neck.

""Well, I mean, I do, can't speak for everyone."" The General grunted as he pulled the Thoran into a submissive position.

""Hah! Wonderful! You also practice individuality!"" Ku'Gorosh rose up with MacArthur still holding on to his back, covered in cranberry sauce and gravy. ""Now I shall show you the ancient Thorian art of Chu'Nasa!""

Grand Chairman Honda flinched as MacArthur flew through the table, breaking it in half and splattering various types of food all over his uniform.

""Hahahahahh!! OOOO BOI,"" MacArthur cackled. ""I ain't had this much fun since Alpha Centauri!""

""Remind me why we promoted him to a general again?"" Phillips whispered to Honda.

""He comes from a long line of competent military leaders. His father, grandfather, and great grandfather would have had my head if I didn't promote him. And...""

""And?"" Phillips responded.

""And... Well... I mean, it's working, isn't it?"" Honda said right before a wayward guk'achug pie made contact with his face. He quietly rose from his seat to excuse himself to the restroom.

""I must admit,"" Ku'Gorosh said to MacArthur as they circled around one another in the dining hall, knives drawn, ""when I first saw you and saw no ridges upon your brow, I thought you humans but a bunch of whelps, but you have proven me wrong! I wish to show the galaxy our hearts, together!""

Ku'Gorosh made a lunge with his weapon, which was quickly parried by MacArthur.

""You mean a militaty alliance? Yeah, I could arrange that,"" MacArthur said between heavy breaths, ""You guys are the only aliens in the whole damn galaxy so far that's worth a damn.""

MacArthur did a false swing with his blade, lowering Ku'Gorosh's defences, and then followed by connecting a strong left hook.

""Not just that,"" Ku'Gorosh responded. ""I propose a union of our two peoples! I wish to marry you, and join our hearts as one!""

The room was silent. The remaining Human Representatives looked at each other with surprise. The Thorans had a similar reaction.

""Sire? You wish to join? With a human?"" Sub-Chancellor Harok asked Ku'Gorosh.

""A human who gives me a challenge in combat, Harok! Who thinks about my needs! No Thoran has ever given me such a feeling!"" Ku'Gorosh responded, blush showing through his opaque, blue skin as his eyes darted downwards.

MacArthur lunged in, taking the opportunity and disarming Ku'Gorosh, moving in close. Their faces mere inches apart, MacArthur looked Ku'Gorosh in the eyes and said ""You should never take your eyes off of your opponent.""

Ku'Gorosh swooned, and MacArthur kissed him passionately. The room was silent. MacArthur looked up at the crowd of people surrounding him and his new fiancé, knowing that he needed to address the room in this historic moment.

""Now how 'bout I show you guys what JACK DANIELS IS!?""

The room erupted in cheers as Grand Chairman Honda walked back in, wiping the remaining pie from his face.

""What happened? What'd I miss?"" He leaned in and asked Phillips.

""It appears MacArthur has found his one true love in the form of the Thoran leader, sir."" Phillips responded unceremoniously.

""Son of a bitch.""

Gardening? Some people grow their own vegetables.
