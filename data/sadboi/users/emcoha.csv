I know plenty of cats that are fine being on a harness, because they were trained to be. Do you think dogs are born automatically used to a collar/harness or leash? 

There are plenty of other options as well (cat condos, fence guards to keep the cat in the yard etc). Just opening the door and letting the cat wander is the laziest and most irresponsible option."
