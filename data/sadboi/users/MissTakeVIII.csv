SuicideWatch,fdac3a5,t1_fda7c8s,1578244399.0,Yeah I do get that. Thank you for the help.
SuicideWatch,fd9t92j,t3_eke4co,1578237741.0,It feels like they are tired of my shit too. I told one of my best friends earlier that I loved her very much and she said thanks. I’m torn between if they would be sad or kinda grateful
macrame,f1magbk,t3_d8lhw7,1569589141.0,"That’s what I was leaning towards, but I do appreciate the confirmation 😊"
macrame,f1ma11t,t1_f1le7o7,1569588811.0,I’m just trying to figure out if you’re actually this much of a hall monitor or just a stupid troll 🤔

Anxiety,eskae8i,t1_eska53e,1562057240.0,"I don’t mean to speak poorly of your friend so much, but she truly sounds lacking in kindness, understanding and empathy. I hope you have better ppl in your life. At least one. I have one friend who makes me feel so validated in my feelings and it makes such a world of difference to me. You deserve that too"
BPD,eska9em,t1_esk7rfv,1562057082.0,"Im so glad therapy helped you so much. I’m actually seeing a new therapist tmw. I haven’t been to one in a very long time. My last one did not believe I had bpd so we nvr worked on therapy related to that, but my psychiatrist diagnosed me w it. Idk. Hopefully this time will make a difference"
Anxiety,esk9t6k,t3_c86ial,1562056555.0,"She clearly does not have any actual understanding of mental illness. I know you have been friends w her for most of your life and we do not know each other remotely, but I hope I can somehow help you to believe she is wrong. Wrong about you and wrong about how mental illness affects ppl"
SuicideWatch,esk8i3j,t3_c84o9y,1562055131.0,"Im not saying you’re ugly bc I clearly do not know, but love can make someone seem beautiful even if they were not previously found particularly attractive by another. I’m js this so you know that for some ppl it’s about more than just looks"
BPD,esk55j4,t1_esk0fxz,1562051700.0,I think if that woman is now his roommate he should

comedy,eqzr42o,t3_bqw9e3,1560404698.0,I feel like her and Kristin Wiig could’ve made such a funny pair
depression_memes,eqxopr6,t3_bzwdgi,1560372076.0,Are you fr lmao? I’ll post what I want when I want and if you have a problem block me genius. Not to mention this is the “depressed forum” so lemme just post sunshine and rainbows for you jackass.
anxietymemes,eqxibkf,t3_bz786d,1560369647.0,I feel this hard
depression_memes,eqxe0xz,t1_eqwqxgj,1560368110.0,That’s great. It’s such a positive reinforcement for your life I bet

bipolar,eqsyhr4,t3_bzj3cw,1560297230.0,I thought I just didn’t have a filter. I didn’t know this was an actual symptom lol
depression_memes,eqsxv9h,t3_bz04xl,1560296742.0,"I know I’m terrible but total lol 

To clarify: not funny if you feel this way but funny bc I completely relate"
SuicideWatch,eqsur97,t1_eqsqsoj,1560294338.0,I wouldn’t have made it to adulthood lol
SuicideWatch,eqsqq82,t1_eqsnmip,1560291338.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,eqsfzt1,t3_bz6q48,1560284038.0,Woah I thought I was insane for having this exact thought. I always hope for cancer or my new current go to is hoping for heart failure. That sounds quick and painless to me. I’ve been having heart pain but I think it’s psychosomatic bc I want it so badly
SuicideWatch,eqsfhs4,t1_eqsa3oj,1560283710.0,I have a similar feeling. I want to die but I’m also scared of death for some reason so I feel like I’m in limbo and it is a painful existence
BPD,eqsbibn,t3_byku5q,1560281110.0,"BPD, bipolar 1, generalized anxiety, severe depression and OCD. 

Life is a constant challenge. I have to find reasons not to hurt myself or commit suicide frequently. Tbh I’ve attempted it but I’ve not succeeded. I think I didn’t put in enough effort bc I didn’t wanna be completely responsible so if I just “accidentally” did it I’d feel better about it.  Not sure why I’m venting on your post 😅"
BPD,eqs9d1q,t3_bz0ge1,1560279697.0,I constantly search for an answer to the motivation question. I don’t know how to do certain things that feel so difficult. It’s like there is a road block in my brain but the road is nvr fixed. I’d like a solution for this question too.
BPD,eqs8sj5,t1_eqs49ck,1560279320.0,"Thank you. I’m definitely going to try this. I already know it’s going to be painful to see all the awful things he’s done and said to me at once, but maybe that will shake this idealization I have w him that he doesn’t deserve."
BPD,eqs8i9a,t3_byv7lo,1560279132.0,Using large doses of any medication can be dangerous. As your tolerance builds up you believe your body can handle more and more but eventually you cannot and you might end up in the hospital waking up w a breathing tube. That was my experience and it was terrifying.
BPD,eqs5nxu,t3_bz6uyz,1560277278.0,"You are definitely not alone in this. My past mistakes make me feel like a waste of space on this earth and even tho I can be incredibly forgiving to the people I care about, I can nvr forgive myself."
BPD,eqs4u87,t1_eqoe470,1560276740.0,You basically covered it. It feels like his post says “hey stop having bpd symptoms” like it’s a choice.
BPD,eqs3pxq,t3_bzez0g,1560276006.0,Ok I genuinely learn so much from this place. I just learned that he gaslights me. That’s actually a thing. It is so strange to put a name on it.
BPD,eqrzjo3,t1_eqrxvmw,1560273384.0,"I’m so sorry that you’re dealing w this too, but I am grateful that you shared that you are. It’s a bit comforting to know you are not alone in your struggles."
bipolar,epr58dn,t1_epny6pp,1559418537.0,Lmao so punny 😂
BPD,epr511f,t1_ephu1z7,1559418434.0,It definitely effects your ability to accomplish your goals bc how can you believe in yourself when you hate yourself
BPD,epr4vym,t1_epcpxal,1559418364.0,"I think I understand. I jokingly sometimes say “I hate myself so much, but I’m always around” in a joking manner but reality is it’s actually true"
BPD,ep8wezo,t3_bu49ha,1559100873.0,"Honestly just reading this and knowing it’s not just me helps so much. I constantly question if my reactions, feelings or thoughts are remotely normal. And how do you even figure that out??"
bipolar,ep8sfn2,t3_bu6elk,1559099255.0,Sad but beautiful and incredibly relatable
