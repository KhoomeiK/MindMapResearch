This is a complicated question that can't be answered simply. If this person is severed and/or has been suffering from a long time, they are likely to be medically compromised and need serious help. You can't just talk someone out of an eating disorder, because it doesn't work like that. If they're a minor, tell their parent or guardian. I know it may seem like betrayal to their trust, but it's important because their health and safety could be at risk. It will ultimately be the best move.
