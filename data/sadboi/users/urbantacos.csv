but don't close your mind completely on the romance and drama genres. that's the preference of the majority of the audience. it may be childish for you, but maybe the audience just wants some easy-read fluff to take their minds off IRL matters. there are lots of action series on the front page of the webtoon app, really. why don't you help push them up on the rankings by promoting/sharing them?"

what makes me click on the comic - first, the cover thumbnail. i like it when the image quality is clean and sharp. second, the title. third, the genre.

why did you decide not to read it - when the thumbnail looks well-drawn but the episodes don't have the same quality. the panels are practically sticking together, bad lettering and bubbling of dialogues, the episodes are cut extremely short so the creator can have multiple uploads (it's annoying), and when there are waaaay too many extras/advertisements/announcements between episodes (this 100% grates on my nerves)

type of art style i like best - the Korean art style basically. i like anime art style, too, but not the too cutesy ones to the point that all the characters look like children lol. i'm not into Disney/Western art style.

many webtoons are notorious with the ""tell, don't show"" writing. maybe it's because the majority of the readers are kids? or maybe many webtoon readers don't want to think critically and they just want to be spoonfed? or maybe the webtoon authors are scared that their work won't be understood by a lot of people?"

now wattpad feels like one those websites that aims to please the big corporates. most of the users (especially the new ones) like to make their profiles and book covers aEsTheTiC that they all seem like one person being copy-pasted. the stories should be wOke to have a chance to be featured. don't even get me started with the paid program and the dumb advertisements in stories.
