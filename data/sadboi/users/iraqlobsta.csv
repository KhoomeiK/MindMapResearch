I was scrolling through the dumpster fire comments section on yt and saw she was responding to nearly every critical post as a personal attack and accusing random people of being Lacey and threatening to sue people commenting critical things on this video. Shes completely lost it. Needless to say, I'm not really as much of a fan anymore, this drama is addictive though.

Her friend Shim makes this video nearly unwatchable. I'm not sure what he has to do with any of this."

ConsulttheTarot,fonemz4,t3_g82k1i,1587918025.0,"I see this card 2 ways, you are either represented by the winner claiming the spoils or you are the defeated, leaving your sword behind and walking out of the arena.

The overall colors of the card are grays and browns. Not what youd call upbeat, happy colors.

 This card doesnt ever present to me as a good feels card. I've found that if you are represented as the winner you did not win the competition by playing by the rules. You may have cut corners somewhere to get to an end goal or had to throw someone weaker under the bus, but I usually always see the 'winner' here as smug for whatever reason. Swords are usually thoughts or spoken/typed words to me, so I would also think this card is communication related."
