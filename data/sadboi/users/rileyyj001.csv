On the flip side, (and please don’t hate me!) I’m reeeeeally gaining a hard dislike for Avery through Ramona’s quarantine stories. I always liked her from what I saw on the show, but there’s something about her attitude that turns me right off. To me, she’s just like her mother and I’m disappointed 🤷🏼‍♂️"

BravoRealHousewives,fqwop4l,t1_fqvzhrs,1589712273.0,"I’m 50/50 on her attitude—sometimes I see it as “0 fucks Erika” and other times I think she’s just playing bored to look cool and above it all. But news flash, E, you’re choosing to be on a sloppy show. She’s the girl that desperately wants to be and remain popular, but she would never ever admit that because to her, it’s cheesy to strive for that."

Sonja gave a great interview! Well worth a listen!"
BravoRealHousewives,fqvdpgj,t3_gl1qgj,1589675092.0,"To me, Erika is just something fun to look at, (and I do not mean that as in objectifying a woman). Her talking head quips are never truly clever or funny and half the time they don’t even make any sense. All she does is say some weird remark in her deeper voice and I think in her mind, she’s the ruler of the group because she’s soooo “real.” I don’t understand why she’s still on the show because she really doesn’t ever add much."

BravoRealHousewives,fqrljbn,t1_fqri8nv,1589586795.0,"I can see that for her first couple of seasons but lately: cue Dorinda drinking herself into blackout oblivion, visiting her old townhouse shouting over her gate to non-existent Len, clinging on to her manor home for dear life, trying to school the ladies on British vs American ways of life, glomming on to every tiny possible dig and blowing them completely out of proportion, causing erratic and chaotic spectacles. She’s becoming everything she’s berated Sonja for, for so long. I understand the “never truly mourning Richard’s death” card, but she’s just as delusional as Luann and Sonja when it comes to her own sense of grandeur."
