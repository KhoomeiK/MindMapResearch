peteholmes,fp0vht3,t3_gal1fe,1588217851.0,I listened to his first book via audible and it was more expanded version of his first episode with Pete. It’s great and his Science Mike podcast is a wonderful example of things that are scarce these days. Religious but through a skeptical scientific lens and never feels pushy.

It’s not every time. And when you’re depressed or can’t see the hope out of anxious fears, any positivity you might turn to, might be the thing to get you through this time. 

My big experience, is that these types of positive affirmations didn’t matter, until I started trusting myself. Sometimes I had a good day and was able to use thoughts like this as a “proof” but most often, it was blind “faith” in oneself before this took hold. In the end, you have more wins from the blind faith because you’re around the next day to reinforce yourself."

lexapro,fh2l5v0,t3_f11eta,1581256716.0,Happens to me too. I believe they’re called “brain zaps”  (worth a google) and seem to be a very common withdrawal side effect for these meds. Won’t hurt you but definitely inconvenient.

YuYuHakusho,eu6jo5a,t3_cesonb,1563501830.0,"It was hard as hell and not very good overall, but something about the poor movement controls made characters feel ‘heavier’ and somehow more real sometimes. You had to take it into account and it gave each character a different feel and sense of being grounded. Am the only one on this?"
