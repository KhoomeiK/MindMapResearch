hamstercare,fo2sagz,t1_fo1zznh,1587472819.0,oh my god! iâ€™m so sorry! i wish i could have helped :(
hamstercare,fo2s2nt,t1_fo27q9o,1587472657.0,ohh! i think iâ€™m just going to move everything closer to him so hopefully it would be easier for him. i would buy some baby food for him. he seems to be ageing fairly slow so hopefully he still has a bit to go before i have to remove the wheel. thank you for all your suggestions!
hamstercare,fo2rjta,t1_fo2qmlx,1587472263.0,iâ€™m so sorry for your loss :( i would start putting his food near him immediately thank you so much.
hamstercare,fo2349e,t3_fyl8w5,1587448272.0,"itâ€™s actually sometimes better to move things around, but if you hamster doesnâ€™t like it then maybe donâ€™t do it the next time you clean"

some hamster would never calm down but honestly just donâ€™t force it."
hamstercare,fo2254a,t3_g21sga,1587447456.0,"hamsters have very bad eyesight so they mainly rely on their ears and nose for directions. if they are in a hamster ball they wonâ€™t be able to smell
or hear clearly. if you do want to let it out i recommend free roaming (but please be careful if you have another pet make sure to put them in separate rooms)"
hamstercare,fo21re3,t3_g2balo,1587447145.0,i would recommend taking it out and only putting it back in if youâ€™re 100% sure that itâ€™s safe
hamstercare,fo21f84,t3_g36exn,1587446866.0,toilet paper tubes are great when you canâ€™t go out. you can use it to make a lot of different toys!
hamstercare,fo217gw,t3_g3d64g,1587446687.0,i would recommend diy-ing one by yourself or an ikea detolf
hamstercare,fo20g2u,t3_g49nnb,1587446082.0,if you put them in a more cooler part of the house maybe move it to a more warm area. also if you arenâ€™t already try using paper based bedding or just rip tissue paper. if these donâ€™t work then try putting a hand warmer beneath the cage but make sure that it wouldnâ€™t overheat check on it as much as you can just to be careful!
hamstercare,fo2086l,t3_g4b74q,1587445907.0,"i would not ever recommend it but dwarf hamsters can sometimes be kept in pairs. if you do keep them in pairs the cage needs to be at least 900 square inches for them, you would also need double of basically everything i would say. if you are just worried about it being bored then donâ€™t worry as long as you give them enough enrichment it would be ideal for them to live alone :)"
hamstercare,fo1zxcr,t3_g4pplf,1587445675.0,donâ€™t worry my hamster does this all the time in the summer. iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s just hot. maybe change the bedding so it wouldnâ€™t be as hot for him!
catcare,fnyx0m2,t1_fnytkvo,1587378835.0,hmmm they seem to be linking keeping them in a cage with behavior issues iâ€™m not very sure. i would not be keeping my cat as an outdoor cat as i have heard horror stories about that. Thank you so much for all you advice and recommendations!
catcare,fnyt4cd,t1_fnyiayv,1587374659.0,"i donâ€™t live alone and thereâ€™s always people home 24/7. i also never spend over 4 hours out. i have done quite a bit of research as iâ€™ve been looking to get a cat for a few years. also iâ€™ve heard from a lot of my friend which are cat owners saying i have to keep them in a cage for around two months when i first get them home, is that true?"
catcare,fnybm40,t1_fny152r,1587358413.0,ooooohh thatâ€™s like really cool i hope they it would be available asap
catcare,fnxzwhr,t1_fnx73ox,1587350079.0,i think ethical breeders are my top choice now but iâ€™m not looking for two as i donâ€™t think my apartment would be big enough for two. iâ€™ve researched on cats for quite a long time and i think i would be fine.
catcare,fnxzi7r,t1_fnxe47l,1587349812.0,i myself am actually looking for a hypoallergenic cat and itâ€™s almost impossible to find except from breeders but iâ€™m still going to try to look on adoption or rehoming sites!
catcare,fnxzadp,t1_fnxoetx,1587349666.0,thank you! i think i might consider to buy from a breeder!
catcare,fnxz4rh,t1_fnxekf5,1587349558.0,i think iâ€™m going to look on more websites and maybe decide later on. thank you very much for the suggestions!
catcare,flwj8gw,t1_fll260v,1585552683.0,yea iâ€™ve been thinking about that but there are so little adoption centers here where i live and if there are itâ€™s mainly dogs which is not allowed in my building. i think iâ€™m gonna try my best to look in a shelter where there are cats. thank you!
hamster,fldfpj6,t1_fld69ld,1585063609.0,hmm okay i really hope my cat doesnâ€™t try to do that either. ðŸ¤£
catcare,flc6yig,t1_flbbqjp,1585021527.0,oooh i think iâ€™m gonna put quite a lot of those. thank you so much!
catcare,flb8mgx,t1_fl5izzp,1584999604.0,i personally want a cat thatâ€™s very energetic and would like to play around since the biggest reason i want to get a cat is so i could have a friend. i am also only out for at most 4 hours each day normally so i think it should be fine for me to get a younger kitten. the only problem is i live in an apartment and itâ€™s fairly small iâ€™m not sure if it would be enough space for two kittens.

hamsters,fkq1vqa,t1_fkq1ld4,1584427113.0,oooh i think iâ€™m gonna start with giving them veggies every week and slowly giving them veggies more often. my hamsters are absolutely obsessed with broccoli though ðŸ¤£
FamilyProblems,fkm9orc,t3_fj6e6n,1584323943.0,"hey, iâ€™m sorry about the struggles but thereâ€™s are 2 ways i could think of right now. you could either go to a boarding school or you could wait until youâ€™re 16 to get emancipated. personally i would suggest boarding school but it still does need your family to agree. for you to get emancipated you need legal documents and you also have to go to court. it also has many requirements most important being you are financially stable on your own. i really hope this helped :)"
FamilyProblems,fkiwmix,t1_fkhod1e,1584230378.0,hey! yea i know. itâ€™s hard to actually accept the fact that your parents donâ€™t care but youâ€™re gonna get through it. my parents honestly thinks i donâ€™t exist all the time. we talk maximum 20 minutes a week and i just feel weird that my friends parents talk to them about life. and i really do mean the last sentence. i am always gonna be here when you need to talk. donâ€™t worry there are other people like us we can get through this :)
FamilyProblems,fkhm0qn,t3_fefdb7,1584201646.0,"hey uhm i have the exact struggle. i feel like my parents donâ€™t know ANYTHING about me. anyone that follows me on insta literally knows more abuse it my life than they do and i just feel ignored? i honestly dint know. they donâ€™t talk to me. whenever they do itâ€™s either telling me to do something or telling me to
not do something. my dad literally doesnâ€™t know what iâ€™m allergic to and that kinda hurts. and honestly my best advice is just to not care either and find friends that care cause i tried to make them care but it never works this had been going on for pretty much my whole life. good luck and iâ€™m here whenever you need someone :)"
hamstercare,fkc3oi0,t3_fhaq8f,1584045169.0,your hamster is turning into a little farmer itâ€™s so cute ðŸ¤£
hamster,fkc3kla,t1_fkc36sa,1584045107.0,"thatâ€™s great you think that. the time on waiting honestly depends on your hamster but definitely wait for at least one whole week for them to settle in! if your hamster isnâ€™t scared of anything you could already start the taming process after one week, but if they are
extremely skittish then i recommend waiting longer! i think that youâ€™re gonna be such an amazing hamster owner :) good luck on the taming process it could sometimes be tricky"
hamster,fkaf2lb,t3_fh98zz,1584005117.0,leave it for around one or two weeks in the enclosure. then start talking to it outside the enclosure so it could get used to your voice. once it doesnâ€™t get scared of your voice put you hand very slowly into the enclosure be sure you do not make any sudden movements.also feed them treats using your hand if they donâ€™t take it leave it where you placed your hands just now. start putting seeds in the palm of your hand they would walk into your hands and take the treats. once it is completely comfortable with being in your hand you can start lifting it up a little bit. after that they are basically tamed! this depends on your hamsters personality too of course. i have an extremely skittish syrian hamster for around half an year already but still isnâ€™t completely tamed itâ€™s normal donâ€™t stress them out!

PiercingAdvice,fjcd5t5,t1_fjc7fvq,1583215712.0,Hmmm ok. I have 3 lobe piercings right now and Iâ€™ve had one cartilage done before but took it out pretty soon after Iâ€™ve always heard people say the second one hurts so much more. I do hope it doesnâ€™t get infected.
PiercingAdvice,fjccxml,t1_fjc95nx,1583215485.0,Ohhh ok. Iâ€™m gonna make sure I wonâ€™t forget to clean it for sure
