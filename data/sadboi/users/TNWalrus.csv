whatcarshouldIbuy,fisoo74,t3_f9jdkv,1582689336.0,"2003 Mazda 6 Owner here. I love my car. It has caused me no issues since I bought it.

I bought my car from a used dealer for about $5k AUD. It had 169k kms on it when I bought it, and it still runs perfectly. It didn't have much service history to it's name, but one can only assume that it was serviced by it's previous owner(s). Judging by that, if it's got a good service history, go for it. Bulletproof car, handling is brilliant for the price. 

Replacement parts are cheap if they aren't OEM. Parts from Mazda themselves are jokingly expensive.

I would recommend the mk1 Mazda 6 to anyone on a budget, it's a brilliant vehicle. Only issue as far as running costs go is that (at least in Aus) it only wants to take 95, rather than the cheaper 91. Though from the 95 I put in it, I get about 8L/100km, so you win some you lose some.

P.S, just read that it's your first car. This one was the first car I ever bought, though I have had shared ownership of other vehicles (parents, siblings etc.) If you want to know more hit me up"

oddlysatisfying,fgfa7li,t1_fgf9jlg,1580732031.0,"The reason for the measuring cup is also similar, most spirit bottles in bars nowdays have 'speed pourers' on them, the cone-shaped things. They allow for a smooth, laminar flow-like pour of the alcohol but also have an air hole that the bartender can block which will stop the flow of  booze out of the bottle, allowing for a clean fill of the cup and perfect measurement

Edit: Just wanted to add, the pouring from the plastic squeezy bottles into the measuring cup is unnecessary, that's probably just to look cool. Alcohol, at least in the UK, has to be served in multiples of measurements so it is important to not have the measure over-fill."
