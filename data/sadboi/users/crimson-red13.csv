podcasts,fqma4bq,t1_fqma1oi,1589474062.0,True crime podcast.
podcasts,fqlldu5,t1_fqllb55,1589460989.0,Enough to pay for hosting and a bit for the both of us. Nope no code needed. It‚Äôs only 60 seconds max.
podcasts,fqljzvf,t1_fqkw4gf,1589460063.0,Anywhere you listen to podcasts!
podcasts,fqkgkg1,t1_fqkgiil,1589426833.0,"Who knows?! Well if you listen, thank you in advance :)"
podcasts,fqkgaki,t1_fqkg2ot,1589426665.0,Yeah! I also let the listeners know when there‚Äôs an ad in the middle. My podcasts name is Undercover Coven. We‚Äôre small but happy. It‚Äôs true crime with cults and occult and weird things. We laugh a LOT.  If you‚Äôre looking for something serious i don‚Äôt think we are for you haha.
podcasts,fqkfpyl,t1_fqkfh9z,1589426323.0,You‚Äôre a great person lol. But yeah from what I know they can‚Äôt tell and it doesn‚Äôt impact us cause we get paid once the ad is approved before the actual episode is published. On my podcast I always put a little knock knock before the ad so my listeners know when to skip haha I don‚Äôt mind.
podcasts,fqkfajc,t1_fqkf86k,1589426068.0,Nope they can‚Äôt tell from what I know.
CreepyWikipedia,fqkavh2,t3_gjcdsz,1589423535.0,Such a sad story. The documentary Dreams of a Life is really good to know about the people around her.
podcasts,fqka8ah,t1_fqjyy5a,1589423163.0,They pay per episode and the spot in the podcast. At the beginning and the end is cheaper than the middle ads. Those pay better.
podcasts,fqjx8xz,t1_fqjx2z1,1589416520.0,I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable talking about that. But I can tell you it‚Äôs been enough to pay for our hosting and a  bit for the two of us.
podcasts,fqjqwws,t3_gj58nm,1589413899.0,I  have a podcast and we use Best Fiends ads just because they pay well and we need money. It's been great for us. We also play the game and love it lol and we only put out ads twice a month max. It a great agreement.
mentalhealth,fqbqoh5,t3_ghrmqw,1589242060.0,I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna go back to real life after all of this. I haven‚Äôt had to deal with people. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack because of crowds in a while. I haven‚Äôt dealt with public transportation. It‚Äôs been so great to manage my own schedule while working from home. It‚Äôs going to be weird when we go back
