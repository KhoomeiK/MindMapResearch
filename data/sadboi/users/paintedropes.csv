I will add liner if needed after to smooth it out. From what I’ve read it’s best to use your own liner preferred before applying the magnetic liner.

I only wore them for nights out kind of thing, but they’d stay very well. The trick was layering enough magnetic liner and getting the lashes right without too much adjustment since the magnets on the lashes would pull up the liner. It was really messy to remove but my garnish micellar water worked. You can clean and reuse the lashes, which is nice."

Overall, I felt like people saw me as average. After my divorce, I started getting more into makeup- lipstick, mascara, eyeliner, brows everyday and what not, fixing my hair and painting my nails, too. Nothing really changed with the men I was involved with, but people around me started treating me different and all the sudden I was a beauty. I remember getting the impression from some newer friends that I must have some easy life always being beautiful and fawned over. It’s the makeup and other beauty stuff!

So I call total BS on the preferring no makeup thing because it has made more of an impression in my experience. My close friend at the time friended me on Facebook and we were looking at old pictures from when I was married and she couldn’t believe how basically frumpy I looked lol. 

With men I’ve actually been involved with, they haven’t looked at me different without it on, which I do appreciate because I don’t want to sleep in mascara. They seem to want that validation of having seen me stripped down to bare faced and the sort of intimacy of that and that they find me beautiful."

I tried to put names with swatches but I’ll list here, too, with short description.

Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk lipstick - this is a sample I received from Sephora so wasn’t a full size bullet. Layers thinner than I would’ve thought and leans a bit mauve-y on my lips.

Maybelline SuperStay crayon in Lead the Way - I was surprised when I got this how close it was to Pillow Talk, though it is a bit cooler/mauve. I can still wear it as a nude though I struggle with some mauves. Easy to apply and dries down to last pretty well.

Holika Holika matte New Nude - recently got this and I love peachy nudes and this is perfect. Lasts pretty well too.

Colourpop Sphynx  - I don’t really like the wear on these lipsticks, they just don’t last but I included it for reference if anyone has this color.

UD Vice Ravenswood and Hitch Hike - loves these two. Ravenswood is cooler and very pretty. Hitch Hike is a great terra cotta.

Mac Powder Kiss Stay Curious - I love this color - pinky red that’s not too bright but it doesn’t seem to last on me, not sure what to think of Mac lipsticks since this was my first.

Tarte Escape and Weekender - live this, more cream finish instead of matte. Dry down to a nice stain though that looks natural. Really like these."

It’s hard but my first therapist told me it’s not my secret, I did no wrong, and empowered me to be more open about what happened to me. My mother to this day tries to diminish what happened to me likely due to her own guilt. It was traumatic and greatly impacted my life, I won’t let anyone diminish my own experience.

They are lasting much longer than the flower beauty liquid blush I have. 

Also really love the Clinique cheek pop in pink honey I got a little while ago. It is subtle and buildable and I like the finish of these. I had ginger pop already but it’s not a go with everything shade for me. It’s pretty, just for when I want a brighter look. I got pink honey to replace the tarte paaarty blush that I love the color of but it’s just so matte and I want more of a natural or dewy finish.

Not sure about- Marc Jacobs Highliner in Black. I can’t stand my eyeliner to smudge and I have watery eyes, so I thought I’d try this. I was using Bobbi brown before, which worked but would sometimes fade/not stay as black so I thought I’d try the Marc Jacobs because of the hype I guess. This does stay very black, doesn’t fade as much, but I’ve had to kind of work with this because it’s thicker than I thought it would be and so soft and kinda hard to sharpen that it can easily turn into a thick line where I don’t want. I think I’ll try the thinner one next time because I do like how black it is and less prone to smudging or my watery eyes. I love my MUFE black gel eyeliner pot but it’s more trouble than a pencil for everyday to get out a brush and everything, plus it’s discontinued now I’m pretty sure."

I usually use the jergens light bronze foam and like it okay (it’s a nice subtle light color to mask my paleness), but wanted to try something new with a little more color. I exfoliated in the shower, moisturized dry areas like knees and feet, then applied it with a mitt. I was worried about it being clear but it said it was supposed to leave a sheen to guide you. There was no sheen I could see though!! So I was kinda like fuck after I started but just had to keep going.  

I was not expecting the color to take so long to show, like 8-10 hours, cause I guess I’m used to having a guide color. It’s a nice deeper color than the light bronze but I noticed a little patchiness on my legs likely cause I just couldn’t see where I had applied. I like the overall effect and it looks good with the jergens face stuff I’ve been using. I’m going to try and use this bottle up, but I’m not planning to repurchase because I think I prefer having a guide color.

Every dog is different but yes, a schutzhund dog can totally be a family dog. Part of what you see in a trial is a lot of time spent working to get that level of engagement out of a dog, the dog is working in that moment and is prompted by their owner to be in that mode. We’ve been taught to give the dog an off switch basically, “cool off” or “okay” to the dog where they can then just relax/be a dog. 

Still, the dog should have the aptitude and temperament for the sport. Prey drive is one of those things, but even if your dog doesn’t have a high drive, you can work with it and see how far you can go. Part of what got us interested in the sport is getting a working line German Shepherd that had IPO-3 dogs in her line, so maybe look for a dog with a similar background. She’s still a puppy basically (7 months) but she’s pretty high drive and she needs a good bit of exercise and attention or she would become destructive.

I just have been confused coming to the conclusion I’m functioning as the Dominant even though I thought he wanted more of that role. We just need to get to equal before we try anything else."
BDSMcommunity,fldr914,t1_fldpetz,1585070153.0,"He doesn’t have a problem with topping, that’s not what this is about. It’s more of the relationship dynamic."
BDSMcommunity,fldo65g,t1_fldlz8v,1585068429.0,"He enjoys a lot of the topping he’s done in our scenes but he does struggle with pulling back when he starts to feel selfish or like an asshole. I love that he’s not narcissistic at all, but he has this block about not being an asshole. I know it’s tough for him."
BDSMcommunity,fldno1n,t1_fldmamn,1585068149.0,"Thanks, this is helping me get closer to where we can at least be more workable. I think he can do this to get back to equal and then we can see from there. I would be happy with that."
BDSMcommunity,fldezu3,t1_fld7orp,1585063186.0,"I’ve not gotten to really submit in so long, I miss it but I’ve learned to live without it. My previous experiences were never stable. I get a taste sometimes in scenes but that’s all. I gave him the option to eventually pursue more of a D/s dynamic and have been encouraging him while waiting for him to decide and take more action. I’ve told him it’s what he wants because I’m okay either way and won’t leave but he keeps putting it back on me asking what I want.

That’s why we met with our mutual friend who is an experienced Dom we respect as sort of another voice to help us see what we might be overlooking/how we would get started. It was kinda eye-opening and validating that the way things work now I’m basically the Dominant. I’m starting to think he’s really a sub. 

I now don’t really see it happening, and basically tried to say let’s just not try it because I feel like I’m in limbo not knowing. He keeps saying he doesn’t want to be an asshole but he wants to try but is tip toeing in and trying to do his research. He’s not giving up I guess. I’m frustrated because he’s basically gotten to be the sub I wanted to be by choosing to be the passive one in the relationship. Even I wanted a sub, I wouldn’t want one that wouldn’t decide anything/give an opinion."
BDSMcommunity,fldao7z,t1_fld6tc5,1585060526.0,"This is what I’m worried about. I need at minimum an equal partner I can rely on to work together. We’ve had some conversations about this where I’ve asked him to take a more active role but he seems to be conflating it with being more of a Dom. He has started to take some steps recently, and I’m kinda waiting to see if he will keep developing that. But the problem is his behavior pattern in our relationship makes me question his dedication. 

From what he’s told me about past relationships and what not, he’s always had to do stuff for past partners because they didn’t clean/cook and he had his children to raise, too. I guess I’ve been totally different to him in that I would suggest things to do/eat, etc. and I do my own chores, and he’s just gone with it because it’s been positive and has taken a passive role. He helps out around the house a lot and does things when I ask if they’re an immediate thing, so it’s not like he isn’t helping but I feel like the Dominant because he basically relies on my direction. I don’t want that kind of dynamic, but it’s kind of what we’ve fallen into. 

It was almost comical talking to my Dom friend suggest steps to take to start more of a D/s dynamic because we were doing most of the things in reverse."
BDSMcommunity,fld3u6d,t1_flbzb0d,1585055839.0,"This is really it for me. It’s starting to burn me out/become a burden that he wants to leave all decisions up to me on our day to day. It’s my first instinct when we have to decide something as simple as what’s for dinner to consult him because his opinion/guidance/final say so even is important to me. I’m always let down because his response is almost always “I don’t care,” so I follow up with options and it’s always “whatever you want is fine.” I’ve made it so easy and good for him that he trusts me to decide everything I guess."
BDSMcommunity,fld2etq,t1_flct3yt,1585054733.0,"I guess that’s where I am is that his actions are showing me that he’s not the Dominant in our dynamic, but he keeps saying he wants to work towards it but it’s new for him and he’s trying to tip toe. Meanwhile he’s left me feeling like I decide our day to day and am actually Dominant. I’d settle for just being equal partners at this point because he feels more like my submissive."
BDSMcommunity,fld1xg5,t1_flc1epq,1585054355.0,I don’t think you really understand. He may have had little experience but he wanted to experiment with bdsm from the beginning. We started off as switches bottoming and topping each other. I see that as bdsm play different from power exchange. I’ve talked to him about my submissive experiences and told him if he was ever interested in experimenting with being a Dom I’d be receptive to it. He’s been researching on his own and we’ve talked with friends in our local community. He’s been learning a lot from a friend of ours who is an experienced Dom. That’s when it came up that he has left me to make all decisions and I function as the Dominant in our relationship. I guess my issue is I want to get to some place where we’re either equal weight in decisions or he’s more Dom.
BDSMcommunity,fld10qi,t1_flbpr3h,1585053609.0,I guess that’s part of the issue too because we’ve read books together on D/s and I have begged him to make a written plan or something but he just never does. He says he’s laid back/go with the flow and doesn’t plan. So it’s like left up to me to plan when we do things and then I feel like I’m in control.
