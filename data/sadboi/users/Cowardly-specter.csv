antinatalism,fprp26e,t1_fpoao3s,1588859213.0,"It's still a fundamentally selfish act because no one can consent to being born. And you can't 100% guarantee them a happy life with minimal suffering. From what I can tell, aspiring parents see the world through rose colored glasses and think that if they raise their child(ren) right then they'll lead fulfilling lives but that is quite a gamble. 
 
 I acknowledge that because having a family is such a common desire antinatalism probably won't catch on as much as I would like. Most people don't get philosophical when they think about having kids. Won't stop us from trying, however."

Your cat is your chosen family and I don't get why so many people are bashing you for it. It'd have been a dick move if you told this to her kid directly but you didn't.
