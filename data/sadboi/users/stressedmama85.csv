I just came out of inpatient for depression/anxiety and I wish I had the answers for this, friend. I‚Äôve yet to put it into practice, but I‚Äôve been told walking even just an hour a day significantly reduces anxiety and depression. I am still at the point where I would rather nap mine away. 

I go to a therapist and do CBT. Also, I am going to EMDR a couple traumatic memories that have contributed to the power anxiety has over me. Hopefully I will conquer it.
