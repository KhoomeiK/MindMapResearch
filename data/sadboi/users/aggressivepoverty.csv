At that point, Larkin, Berruzzi, Hronek etc... will have lost 120+ hockey games in 2 years. That scares me into thinking a Buffalo Sabres culture could develop and they could really have their passion for the game drained out. 


You are definitely right that buliding the team, and picks/pieces are more important, but we cant destroy the culture. Buffalo has had legit pieces for a few years now and still cant perform because of how bad their culture is."
