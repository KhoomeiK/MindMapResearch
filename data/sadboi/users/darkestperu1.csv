Then: Jenna meets a new girl who she gets along with really well. She‚Äôs hung out with Jenna a few times and talks about her often and I feel jealous.

It‚Äôs just not the right environment for you right now. It sounds like you‚Äôre really sinking right into the feeling of dread with nothing to grasp onto to pull yourself out.

Can you take a leave of absence (you probably would need to explain what‚Äôs going on to HR / your boss)? Take some time off and decide wether you want to stay later? How financially fucked would you be to leave your job? Maybe you need a more casual gig for a bit or just a new environment. 

You are not wrong or a bad person for needing to leave your job. You are not a lazy person because you worked hard in school. You are lazy at work because you are stressed out and depressed. If you can‚Äôt be there right now, that‚Äôs okay. You do not need to torture yourself emotionally.

I hope you can find a way to deal with this without derailing your relationship with your dad. You should feel proud of yourself that you‚Äôve been there for him and have been able to help and support him. Seriously, you can feel really good about yourself for his.

Does he currently have a therapist? Is there a local NAMI support group you can maybe accompany him to before you leave? Can you set up routine facetime dates once a week or so to reassure him you‚Äôre not going to disappear from his life entirely?

Right now i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs hard because you are trying to do what‚Äôs right for you and the guilt is making you feel badly about what should be a positive moment in your life (and moving is difficult as it is). 

Please try not to ice your dad out. He is hurting right now, but he needs to understand everything will be okay. From a BPD perspective, his FP is about to leave and he‚Äôs probably fearing abandonment just like we do.

You‚Äôve already spent the money for schooling, you may as well take the exams despite the extreme stress (if you can). Better to try and possibly fail then drop out and definitely fail. If you‚Äôre like me, it will come back to haunt you if you throw in the towel completely. You can at least take some pride in the fact you gave it your all.

School was also a huge trigger for me. We do not handle stress well - it‚Äôs part of the whole BPD package. Things will come up, even when you‚Äôre not in school, that will be just as stressful and send you spiraling. Dropping out of school will not make your mental struggles go away.

Be forgiving to yourself and allow yourself to take breaks when you need them. Take time to reflect on your mood. Studying 24/7 will just drive you insane. Come up with a plan / routine and stick to it for the meantime to try and create some sense of stability.

Easier said that done, of course. When I was in school I had one of my biggest meltdowns, totally snapped and called my school‚Äôs mental health services department because I was ready to find a bridge to jump off. If your school offers something similar, I would recommend reaching out to them. They are sometimes able to make arrangements for academic ‚Äúleniency‚Äù in special circumstances. They also may be able to help you get mentally organized so you can manage better in your classes. If you haven‚Äôt already done this, it might be a good next step.

I personally blame John for the previous sexual assault and staging. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard for me to be convinced that the assault was directly linked to the head blow. On another recent thread they were pointing to the fact that she was wiped down indicates there was a true assault that evening. I could see that also as being part of staging, though, to cover the fact that no foreign DNA would be found. Someone also recently suggested (I feel like I should be taking notes on where I‚Äôm reading things so I can source, lol) the paintbrush was used for scraping as part of an attempt to clean up assault evidence. I guess I could see that as staging for the same reason. I may just be super in denial.

JonBenetRamsey,evhc8th,t1_evgsuw8,1564524109.0,"Wow, interesting! I have like the opposite view. BDI, John staged w/ Patsy‚Äôs help but Patsy was essentially forced to pay along. So interesting her talent was dramatic interpretative readings! I have a slight feeling the call was scripted and she was reading off a piece of paper. Her answers are awkward it seems in parts she may be reading a script and getting caught off guard by questions. 

John finding the body leads me to believe there‚Äôs no way he wasn‚Äôt involved in planning the crime."
JonBenetRamsey,evhao9k,t1_evh6xmg,1564523421.0,"I 100% think John was the ‚Äúringleader‚Äù / controller but, I mean, Patsy was his wife. Seems normal to be by your wife‚Äôs side while she‚Äôs dying, to be fair."
JonBenetRamsey,evh928m,t3_cjvhqw,1564522729.0,"I would be blown away if we came to eventually find out the crime was premeditated. I personally don‚Äôt believe it was - it just seems so improbable with how sloppy and improvisational everything appears to be (to me). She could have bought those items that day for innocent reasons. We also have no proof that‚Äôs what she bought as you pointed out. 

I‚Äôm soooo RDI biased but I don‚Äôt think this is incriminating for Patsy."
JonBenetRamsey,evdiay2,t1_evcnncn,1564438920.0,Why do you think John would cover for Patsy?
JonBenetRamsey,evdgcth,t1_evd1orw,1564437578.0,"Oh, there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôd forget the last time he saw her alive. I remember the last time I saw my deceased pets alive and I have a terrible memory (of course losing a pet pales in comparison to losing your daughter - it‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve had to a child). There is no way he is misremembering. He is changing his story (lying) to fit his narrative. No innocent person would do that. I still struggle with who delivered the blow but I feel sure John was heavily involved in the staging.

*edit: to elaborate, I just read Ardnt‚Äôs report and I trust her opinion (I‚Äôm also RDI biased -for sure). John was the one moving about the house, the one who retrieved the body, the one able to keep astonishingly calm considering the circumstances. Ardnt accuses John of basically putting on a show. He was the one leading the way. In interviews, Patsy seems incoherent at times. I believe her grief was real (I didn‚Äôt for the longest time - I thought PDI because I was convinced she wrote the note. I still think she may have - under John‚Äôs direction). I believe she was most likely involved, though (unchanged clothes).

I read a JDI theory that was really intriguing - I think it was a blog called ‚ÄúSolving JonBenet‚Äù. They believed Patsy may not have been involved in the staging at all. Basically, it went something like this: John would have set up the crime scene to look like a kidnapping, wrote the note himself, and planned to sneak the body out of the house under the guise of following ransom instructions. However, Patsy called the police and ruined John‚Äôs plan because they were not in cooperation."
JonBenetRamsey,evc9s1l,t1_evc3lri,1564410093.0,"I think everything that came after the head blow is staging. They should have called 911 at that point and didn‚Äôt. For me, this would primarily include the sexual abuse (prior abuse not staging), garrote and ransom note. 

I have so many questions surrounding the sexual assault. This was just me trying to play out a possible reason... I make a lot of assumptions to do that. Definitely conjecture and great points there.

The way John seemed to be leading the way in terms of behavior when the police arrive leads me to believe he is the guilty one. But that‚Äôs based off Ardnt‚Äôs account, which some people find questionable. If it were Burke, I don‚Äôt understand why the parents would help cover up. But just because I don‚Äôt understand doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt plausible."
JonBenetRamsey,evc920z,t1_evbu0e6,1564409573.0,"Honestly, just based on what I‚Äôve read / observed about John, he seems very controlling and just generally in-control. It seems out of character to do something so risky as whack his young child on the head with a blunt object. 
Also, just fits in with my assumption that she was hit in the basement as I can‚Äôt imagine John bringing her down there to hit her. If John or Pasty delivered the blow to the head, I can‚Äôt imagine it would take place in the basement. Just doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs a reason to be down there late at night before an early trip. But again, this is all conjecture and opinion! Good call out!!"
JonBenetRamsey,evc8qvj,t1_evbfuzd,1564409348.0,"I needed to make a lot of assumptions in order to be able to put together a semi-coherent narrative. I believe John is a liar, but for some reason (personal bias, I guess) I believe him about assembling the toy because Burke said the same thing. No good reason on my end, fair point."
JonBenetRamsey,evb7z46,t1_evb12zs,1564368550.0,"Yes. I don‚Äôt even remember the point I was trying to make. Just that its important evidence because it helps establish the fact that JonBenet did not go right to bed after the party (asleep in the car, etc), and may not have gone to bed at all as the Ramseys claim. Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding what a red herring is... I definitely do not think the pineapple was the catalyst for the attack. But it‚Äôs still important to consider because it helps establish the timeline i guess."
JonBenetRamsey,evavnha,t1_evarpjv,1564358504.0,"I agree that some give the pineapple too much importance, but I think it‚Äôs still important. It proves is that JonBenet did not get carried to bed from the car that night. She was awake enough to eat pineapple from the bowl."
JonBenetRamsey,evanarj,t3_cj1xqg,1564352093.0,"The obvious answer for RDI is the ransom note, the purpose of which was to intentionally* mislead the police and create confusion.

It‚Äôs hard for me to think of anything else, honestly. Maybe the broken basement window, but I‚Äôm unsure that was intentional / directly related to the crime."
JonBenetRamsey,ev3bwry,t3_ci0hz9,1564192514.0,"Thanks for sharing! I‚Äôve never read her report for some reason, so I just read it quickly. So, thinking about this particular part... the way John goes and makes contact (excessive contact, in my opinion, considering a detective just asked you not to touch) with JonBenet‚Äôs body, AND THEN Patsy comes into the room and proceeds to lay on top of the body... it seems its part of the plan to contaminate the crime scene. They needed to do that publicly, obviously, to explain away any DNA or clues that they may have left behind. I‚Äôm imagining John looking down the hall for Patsy, maybe thinking ‚ÄúHurry up, Patsy, this is the time!‚Äù Or - maybe he realized last minute that it needed to be done, and he was trying to signal to Patsy to do the same thing. All pure conjecture of course."
JonBenetRamsey,eudi438,t1_eucxsby,1563718036.0,Stand by to communicate seems to make the most sense assuming theyre expecting a phone call fom the supposed kidnappers that morning.
JonBenetRamsey,etrkvc3,t1_etrilzx,1563123319.0,"> I think it's very possible that whoever did the staging was the abuser, and didn't tell the other one exactly what they'd done to her.

Just thinking on this: is it fair for me to say John is the only one we can ‚Äúprove‚Äù was in on the staging? He knew the location of the body and was the one to retrieve JBR. Did Patsy / Burke do anything to display they had some type of inside knowledge of the crime? Off the top of my head I can‚Äôt think of anything. I‚Äôve come to believe JDI."
transpassing,esiny2h,t3_c7uviq,1562017033.0,The most obvious things to me are the eyebrows and jewelry. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre probably not able to grow thicker brows (yet!) but if you are grooming them I‚Äôd pump the breaks. The septum piercing reads andro but the nostril piercing reads feminine. The necklace also reads fem. Congrats on taking the step to a happier life where you can be who you are!!
transpassing,esilnz8,t1_esi5fos,1562015893.0,"The fact you have thick eyebrows makes them such a great canvas to have any type of brow shape you want, really.

transpassing,esdbrfm,t3_c73l6n,1561852776.0,"You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong, but I think some makeup would help increase the femininity of your appearance. I would suggest practicing using an eyebrow pencil and mascara. You have such beautiful eyes and you should emphasize them. I also think some bronzer and a touch of blush would go a long way. Lipgloss might be a good idea. I think you just have to do some exploring and see what works best on your face. Have fun with it!!"

I feel like the hammer will have to come down eventually but he‚Äôs been there three years! We used to get along just fine and I knew about his anger problems and it never bothered me until the anger was directed at me. I don‚Äôt hate him or anything, which makes this hard.
