I got institutionalized for knocking out a bully with a trashcan at 13. Was there for a week, then got sent back an additional 90 days when I kicked my mom after attempting to poison myself. 
I have to take over 700mg of meds to stay sane. I was (all of the above) heavily abused by family members growing up. I dress differently than others and couldn't care less what people think of me anymore...  I just move along. I'm on ssi and seeing docs twice a week and haven't been institutionalized in several years, but I still fucking hate myself. 

I'll definitely check out that book. Is it on audible?"

AskReddit,fgihk9x,t3_eyptl5,1580821846.0,"I kind of just needed to get this off my chest, too:
I was with a guy, let's call him Jeff. Jeff started out seeming like an honest person; just a guy who was hated and bullied growing up, just like me. I knew the relationship wouldn't last long after he proposed to me literally three days after dating. 
Before I go any further, I was really young and naive. Was abused, bullied, and constantly abandoned my whole life. I was terrified to be alone. A little extra hindsight, this was my first real relationship and I lost my virginity to him at 20 years old. 
Anyway, I told him it was way too soon and I also didn't feel comfortable being called someone's soulmate. It was only three days. 
So, the beginning of the relationship already was going downhill. He coaxed me into losing my virginity, and then after, would rape me if I said no. He refused to work... My mom would even text me at work saying he was only playing video games. I would work almost full time, do chores, pay bills, etc, while he sat on his dead ass playing video games. 
If he didn't get his way, he'd hit me, insult me, ""you never do anything for me!""
I had become legit afraid if I tried to leave, I'd probably die... 
At the end of it, I was starting school again. I don't know what I was doing, I used prerequisites to not be home. He yelled at me about cheating (which I've never done to anybody,) and I said I had enough. Eight months and FINALLY I lost it. He back handed me and I got really angry. I hadn't been this angry since I was 13. I threw a trashcan at this girl and kicked my mom that year. I had very violent thoughts that year. 
I took all of his things and put them in the middle of the road. When he was outside saying he ""didn't do anything,"" I said no more. 
He kept stalking me, waiting for me to go to class at the college, he JERKED OFF TO MY FRIENDS DOING IT outside the houses window. I had to file a restraining order on him. 
This is really heavy for me, so if this was enough, I suggest you stop here. 
When I went to the courthouse to file this, i was informed he was a sex offender and did time. 
He stalked and wrote letters to a 12 year old and kept sneaking into her room. He had kept asking the girl to let him watch her pee. 
I literally moved away after the order went through..."
