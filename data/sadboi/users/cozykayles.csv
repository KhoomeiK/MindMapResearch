Wheels,fpi6mdo,t1_fphrxns,1588634706.0,i actually emailed konig and they told me that these wheels have been discontinued for abt 10 years and they don’t have any keys for the center caps. so they suggested prying them open with a big flat headed screwdriver :/

eczeMABs,fg3ziqy,t3_ewqwas,1580492994.0,i really hope that dupixent finds a solution for these eye issues because my lord do they suck
eczeMABs,fg3zfx1,t3_ewqwas,1580492946.0,my dermatologist recommended ocusoft eye wipes. they aren’t a cure but they do help a lot with the irritation and crusting

EczemaCures,fef802n,t3_eolnmw,1579050348.0,"i would buy some cotton gloves to wear while you’re at home and make sure to apply moisturizer before you put them on! i used to have it really bad on my hands and fingers but it takes a lot of patience for it to go away. if you decide to put any ointment on it when using cotton gloves use a minimal amount because the gloves will encourage the skin to soak it all up and you just don’t want to put too much on. u got this! 

edit: i forgot this sub is for natural remedies but even if you don’t use ointment/creams the cotton gloves should help while doing ur day to day activities so that you don’t scratch at the blisters"
eczeMABs,fdj95h8,t1_fcunlxo,1578462056.0,hey OP just wanted to check in to see if u have seen any improvements!

eczeMABs,fcuhbfc,t1_fcucjmq,1577980959.0,"i would expect some tightness but depending on the severity of ur skin at the moment that may be causing redness and ur skin feeling sore. also ur peeling so yeah i would say that would cause soreness too. i never got sore but then again we are all different :) don’t lose hope though because after this shedding stage things will start to go up. i would wait until ur next dose to see if it’s gotten better, and if not then definitely go to ur derm if you haven’t called them already. dupixent is a miracle but it just takes a while to really see results."

eczeMABs,f2xzwzh,t1_f2xz8yy,1570484500.0,"YAY!!! taking my fifth dose on thursday i’ve had lots of improvements with my skin my eczema patches have gone away, i’ve had a lot less itching as well. but after my fourth dose i’ve been flaking a lot and super dry even though i put on a lot of vanicream. i’ve had some eye problems but it isn’t something that bothers me too much i use eye drops and i’m fine.  i haven’t used steroids in a long while which is super nice as i would fly through them like crazy before i started dupixent. i still have a pesky patch on my leg but if i just stopped picking at it i’m sure it would go away. other than that it’s been nothing but a miracle for me!"

AskReddit,es3izam,t1_es27jty,1561563635.0,"my mom has been sober for half a year, one thing she lives by when she gets cravings is “just get through 5 minutes” and then just increasing the time. the people at her aa meetings are always saying something along those lines. just get through these next 24 hours. think about the benefits in the future. you can do this! I recommend look into an Alcoholics Anonymous group, the people there are so caring and supportive, even if you relapse. good luck, I wish you the best!"

bipolar2,eonwcvb,t3_bsep7t,1558723196.0,one time this guy at a party punched me in the face and then right after that me and a bunch of my friends jumped him. i didn’t even come at him in a bad way. he was being mouthy and just drunk as fuck and I was like hey you need to calm down. he was scrawny and talking all big and bad saying he wanted to fight everyone. he didn’t like that I was trying to calm him down because I didn’t want him to embarrass himself and get his ass beat but then he punched me and I was like ohhhhh fuck no I’m the wrong bitch to mess with and the wrong bitch to punch in the face!!! I had never gotten violent towards anyone until that day. but I was just tryna prevent him from getting his ass beat for talking all recklessly but he got jumped anyway :/ one of my friends had a strap too and ig he pistol whipped the fuck out of that kid. it was one hell of a night
