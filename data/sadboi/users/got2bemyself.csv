I dont remember everything i have stored, it may be stuff i inheritated from my great grandparents. I dont remember. So ut maybe just be crap there, from my childhood with no value since i dont remember whats there. I know there are some valubale things, but dont remember if there just a few things or many things.

I have read that bounderies are important, and fex give a narc consequenses, so i tought maybe an answer where i gave her consequenses. But when everyone Who has commented on this post advice me not to answer, i see now that thats the best ""answer"" i can and should give her.

And i know i can call the Police if she shows up, but i think it Will be hard do it if it becomes reality. I know she is a narc, but at the same time, it feels so wrong to treat my own Mother that way, Even tough i know i have the best reasons. And another thing, the Police is probably 30-45 min away, they often dont prioritize such cases, if its not any danger, they can prioritize if they understand they need to interfere to solve (Escort) the conflict etc.

My Brother dont know why i dont talk to nmom at the moment, or how i feel or anything. I realized nmom is an narc 4 weeks ago, the situation and me realizing how she is, is all New."

raisedbynarcissists,f8q4mw6,t1_f8mih4j,1574712047.0,"Thanks for your advice. It helped me realized that i need a serious talk with my Brother, Im gonna call him one day, and hopefully he will understand.

The plan is staying at my uncles place (nmoms Brother) and he is out of Town and country that periode (no wife or Kids either, a bachelor), so i will be alone in his appartment. But i need Keys, and my nmom and aunt (nmoms Sister) got the keys to the appartment. I know nmom will force contact, demand she will deliever me the keys. And its not much better to try to make my aunt deliever the keys, she is flying monkey and support nmom. My uncle is also a flying monkey and loves to have power over other people, and can actually suddenly say that i need to talk to my nmom if i want to stay with him etc. And i know he can make a rule that im not allowed to refuse nmom to visit because its his appartment, so his rules, i need to obey if i want to stay. And if im going home, its impossible to avoid nmom, because where i live, we celebrate Christmas the 24th with big dinnerparty and after open presents, and nmom his hosting this. So if im going home and the plan is to avoid her, not see or interact with her, then no point of going home.

I know i should just celebrate alone, and the most scary part isnt being alone. The scary part is that nmom will put hell on earth, she will maybe travel 660 km to force me to talk with her, Im afraid she will call my coworkers, the Police, my doctor, say she is worried, that im depressed etc. My coworkers and doctor are informed of my fair of that. She will also guiltrip and gaslight me so bad that i will struggle enjoy Christmas."
raisedbynarcissists,f8q0lk4,t1_f8mhjdb,1574710248.0,"I know, but it feels so harsh. They dont know why or understand, they are clueless. But at the same time, if i told them my story, how she treats me, how she is, they wont believe or understand me, they will probably say im overreacting, and normalize her behaviour. Say that its probably not that bad, or tell me that im lucky because i have a mom that cares etc. I know thats good enough reason to cut contact with them too, but then again, it feels harsh when they are clueless.

Edit: all this makes me really confused, so if my answers are vague or conflicting, then it is because im confused and struggle to trust myself, whats real, not real etc with the whole situation, nmom, my family etc. I dont know what to believe or not, not them, not me. Dont know whats right and wrong. In one moment i believe in myself and how i feel, the next moment i question everything, thinking what if im wrong, what if i misunderstood, what if im overreacting etc."

I dont know what the future brings, if i want NC or start with LC, to make the road smoother to NC fex. This is all new to me. I know for sure i need to make some decisions, and first im going to talk with my Brother how i feel, but just keep it general and Basic, because im not sure witch side he is on yet. But If there is anyone in my family i think will support me, its him. And i need every support i can get."
raisedbynarcissists,f8mf6tb,t1_f8mbk1b,1574630794.0,"I have tought about it, but afraid they dont believe me. I have never got any support from any familymember before, i have always been alone. So i dont know where i got them, and im not strong enough to ""get in a fight"" with them to, like nmom now.

I have informed my teamleader at work and my doctor, so they know she can suddenly contact them and claim untrue stuff. And i have tought of reporting her to the Police if she cross the line to illegal.

She actually knows why im gone NC with her. Before i understood she was a narc, i was angry and told her how she is. Later That same day my doctor and a friend told me that maybe she is an narc, and then everything got more clear."
raisedbynarcissists,f8mdddx,t1_f8la2im,1574630315.0,"Thanks for advice! And you are on spot, she knows how to create drama so people will feel sorry for her! And to force me to respond, she tried that when i told her i wanted NC for a while.

Its hard to put myself first, i have never been allowed to do so, but im tired of her bs and her Trying to controll me. So thats why i seek advice, because i dont know always if im the bad person. Im used to hear im selfish, bad person etc if i put myself first or do something she doesnt approve."

raisedbynarcissists,f8m9xid,t1_f8kikeb,1574629475.0,"I think beeing alone would be easier if nmom was normal, i know people with ""normal"" familys sometimes just want to be alone, and their family accept it and understand it. But i think nmom will make a realy big deal out of it, and by purpose make it difficult for me to be alone.

Nmom are also expert and involve the family, and I have witness her lie to people so she get what she want. Im afraid they believe her. She can be reeeeeally dramatic, cry, be hysterical etc. Im not suprised if she would call the my coworkers or even Police and say she is worried about me and that im depressed and stuff."
raisedbynarcissists,f8l7f04,t1_f8kvwoo,1574619204.0,"If im going home, no matter when, i have to stay at my uncle or cousin, and thats infortuante because fex my uncle will be on my nmoms side, and cousin doesnt understand, she probably maybe will support me, but doesnt understand. So going home without seeing nmom is almost impossible, and if i manage that. She will find a way either way to see me. Fex at my brother and sister in laws house.

And i dont want to celebrate xmas at a shelter etc (working/voulenteering) because i need rest, i have health issues, and my work is kinda similar. And i dont want to celebrate xmas with the same thing i work with every day. I love my Job, but i need my holidays and days off too, i dont want my sparetime to become work."
raisedbynarcissists,f8l5ytx,t1_f8kngpt,1574618761.0,"Its not because not seeing me, but because he and my Sister in law are expecting baby this december, and they want me home because of that. And their opinion is that i but my fight with nmom away for a few days this xmas for them, be happy for them, if you understand what i mean?

Our father is a jerk and never been a real father, never been there for us, been an adult and fex didnt put his disagreements with other people to fex atend their wedding, i know that was tough for my Brother, and he is starting to realized he have to let go of dad, because he doesnt want to be a dad to us. So family conflicts are hard for my brother, and he take it more personal then he should, but i understand him, because nmom manipulate him, and she will manipulate them so think im the bad guy."
raisedbynarcissists,f8kjbt4,t1_f8kgbjt,1574611712.0,"Thanks for your answer. Im not ready, but i know if i dont answer, she will involve the rest of the family, make them try to convince me to talk with her, and they are on her side, and have always been. They think that i cant live without them, my family isnt much better then nmom, they give me guiltrips, dont believe in me, dont treat me like an adult, dont respect og accept me. They see this as a childish and selfish behaviour from me,when in fact i stand up for myself. And im already the bad guy, i have always been the bad guy.

I have an adult relationship with my Brother, i talk with him, i dont go trough nmom. But he confess to nmom, and she manipulate him to think that im the bad guy and offend them by not coming home to meet their baby. And its not possible to visit him without nmom. Regardless she will force contact with me, and I have no stay with familymembers when i go home. And he celebrate xmas with nmom this year, its her turn  ""to have us"". (My parents are divorced, dad left us (he is no better then nmom, probably narc too) and grandma and nmom take turns having us on xmas.)"
raisedbynarcissists,f8kg9fm,t1_f8k5up2,1574610865.0,"Thanks for your answer. Its really hard. I guess if i dont answer her, she will make my family call me and try to convince me to talk to her. And she have treathen to come where i live. She doesnt accept that i need space, because that doesnt benefit her. I have wrote a list with pros and cons about going home, its 3 on the pros, and 17 on cons. But the decision is still hard, even tough i know the answer. I know i should celebrate xmas alone, but im afraid of the consequenses. Im all alone, i dont know many people where i live now."

But i at the same time i know nmom dont need to tell my aunt to try contact me, my aunt will suggest that even before nmom has time to ask.

raisedbynarcissists,f6i1ce0,t1_f6ckfyb,1572869992.0,"First i had decided to go home for a few days during Christmas, but not sure anymore. I think it would be easier to gray rock her from distance, and not at home. She will then demand answers for my behaviour, and I know i should not explain myself, Just say something that this is decided and not up to discussion. But then she will try even harder. Point is, i dont think im mentally strong enough to gray rock her face2face. But at the same time, if i dont Come home to Christmas, she will make a hell out of it, and I will have to deal with the rest of the family (flying monkeys) etc. All this is new to me. I actually think she is a psychopath, i Googled psychopath Vs narc, and psychopath is dangerously correct. At least she has almost all the signs of an psychopat.

I have started work on bounderies toward others. Before i did as your example, because i taught thats how it works. No i see it dont work that way. No one have ever teached me that i need to set bounderies. Except my mom, but in her weird mind my bounderies are to disrespect and to be broken, or just pretend i never sat bounderies. But I see now that Im in charge of my life, so then it is my rules, and not up to discussion. But i think Its easier with bounderies toward others such as men or new friends, but not to People Who has known me basicly my whole life. Probably because People Who has known me my whole life (family and friends i grew up with) have a special way to make me daubt myself."

She knew very well i had to work, she had known it all the way. I told her she should come during the weekend when i dont work, but she didnt.

I have had periods i want to live close home to family and friends, but already in 7th grade i start wanting to escape from nmom and rest of the nfamily. But after studies i wanted to move back home, but because its difficult as a newly educated to get work, i had to move up North for work (2500 km from home). Also there i met a psycopath/narc (my leader) and wanted to move after 3 years. Ended up a bit closer to home. I realize now after years in fog that every choise is a reason for it. But at the same time i love moving around and exploring my country and the People. But i also see that i always hope i find a family in the new place i move, that will ""adopt"" me, that can be my new family, new ymom, ydad, yfamily. Is that weird?

My grandmother (nmoms Mother) called me yesterday, couldnt talk because i was in cinema. I dont know if it is because nmom sent her or if its only because its a little while since we talked.

I dont know if nmom will accept bounderies, because she is my mom, then i have no right to set bounderies (her and familys opinion), she will get offended and hurt (dont know if its real, i always get a feeling she is fake then), and the whole family will involve and support nmom and tell me to be Nice to her etc. Im a oversharer, so i have real difficulties with being medium chill. The good thing is, that i open up to my doctor on friday, so he wants to support and help me. First time it happend! I have tryied open up before to doctors, social workers, child welfare, familyoffices, but nothing done or they didnt believe me, because they knew my mom and ive actually been called a spoiled shitty brat from the child welfare.

I realy dont know what the right thing is, if it is to set bounderies or ignore her and be alone at Christmas.
