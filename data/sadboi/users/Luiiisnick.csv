AskReddit,fndzcvy,t3_g0ule6,1586880290.0,"Well, kind of a sad twist, but here you go.

I had depression for most of my life after I was 10 years old. I always cried in school, often in secret and had major thoughts about suicide. Also my father was an absolute tyrant and my mother was an alcoholic.

I never knew what's really wrong with me inside my head and outside. I had so much selfhatred at one point I sometimes just burst out crying, but I held it back. I often had euphoric moments when I layed in bed and just cried my heart out and wished for death.

I was 17 when I got diagnosed with cancer (Hodgkin Lymphoma) in October 2018 and 3 days prior to that I layed in my bed, tears were running down the sides of my cheeks and I said: ""Please god, give me cancer or a deadly illness that will end my life."". After I said that I felt tingles down my spine and felt an euphoric feeling in my whole body. As if somebody heard my death wish and granted it.

I had chemo therapy and many complications such as -infection while I had no immune system; so much pain that I could only lay in bed for 10 days, 23 days in hospital and couldn't eat anything but an apple for the early time, later I literally only deficated blood and it wasn't nice; 
-immense unknown lower body pain; that was literally the most teeth grinding pain I ever had for 7 days straight, couldn't sleep for one minute and I could only scream because they did not give me pain medication at all, I literally wished that I would die (I was alone most of the time in the hospital cause, it was an hour drive away from home); -psychosis through too much pain medication; thought I was a god, only spoke shit and nonsense, nearly died cause of my catheter which got infected through bad handling.

After all of that I literally was so weak (47kg 1,78cm) that I couldn't even open a bottle or go to the toilet alone. 
Fast forward I started radiotherapy in February 2019 and it went over after one month and after it I just layed down and watched TV. I did nothing else besides watch TV. Literally nothing. Felt so bad and didn't want to do anything, always really sad.

And you know what's best? My father committed suicide on 13th of May 2019. He always contemplated suicide cause he had so much pain in his ankles and was antisocial, didn't have any friends and literally always lost his mind about everything. He literally left me, my mother and my brother.

Last chapter is I went to rehabilitation which didn't do anything and later back to work. I felt ""okay"" again finally after one year of agony in September 2019.

Fast forward to April 2020 and till this day after surviving fucking cancer and everything, I still have depression and often wish to die or just fucking jump off somewhere like my father did. Can you believe that? It's ridiculous. At least my mom is 1 month sober.

I'm 19 right now and when I see people complaining how shit their life is, they probably had a perfect life when comparing it to mine.

So, I got what I dearly wished for, my father killed himself and I'm still sad. God damn it. Thanks for reading if anyone read it."
