You guys operate on emotion and ignore the facts that Biden is a terrible horrible trash canidate that's propped up by corporate powers. He is gonna lose if he runs against Trump. It's time to either find a third party candidate or for Biden to drop out. I honestly don't believe any of you want Trump out because you ignore the facts and just suckle up the Democratic establishment. Like the same thing didn't happen with a better canidate in 2016? Look what happened to her. You are fighting an incumbent now!

SandersForPresident,fpbysnt,t1_fpbmkz7,1588482358.0,Bernie made leftism more digestible for the American public. As a result we have people that aren't educated on the leftist struggle in our movement. They still believe that the Democratic party has at least part of the people's interest in mind.
