relationship_advice,fo9bylm,t3_g6fwn5,1587615446.0,"You’re allowing this piece of trash human to harm your “best friend” who completely trusts and depends on you to protect him. You need to obviously do one of two things: give up your dog to someone who will properly love and care for him or I don’t know the more obvious rational choice kick the bastard out of your life and never speak to him again. 

I swear if anyone ever laid a hand on either of my dogs there’d be shit to pay. 

Plus dogs are very good readers of people. Of your dog is fully trained and is pooping on his pillow and putting himself between the two of you he’s sending you a pretty clear message that this guy is a bad guy and that he’s trying to protect you. 

Bottom line anyone who hits an animal on anger when it is defenceless to their strength/size will almost always graduate to hitting their partners. Stop letting your dog take the brunt of the abuse from a terrible guy and step up as a dog parent and protect that little guy. Especially cause he’s little he doent have much defends himself against a grown man."

relationship_advice,fnzctxd,t3_g4t9x2,1587391489.0,"100% this request is not appropriate  for you to make. They have grown up together and obviously the families are still close so asking him to not acknowledge her at family functions and such is very rude and immature. I can understand why you’re insecure given his past indiscretions but that stems more from your insecurities than his actions. It seems to be that he’s respected your wishes to put some distance between the two of them given he has blocked her on social media so he has proved to you he is trying to make this easier for you. Asking your partner to cut someone out of their life is immature and selfish. I think you should really take a look at your own insecurities and work on feeling confident in yourself. 

Baseline is if you don’t trust him (and you’ve shown as much by snooping in his phone) than you shouldn’t be with him."

relationship_advice,fntnv8o,t3_g3vchs,1587245417.0,I think it sounds like you have a lot of unresolved fear and issues surrounding the idea of porn based on your passed experiences. Instead of projecting these issues onto your partner you should look at getting some help for yourself to deal with all the trauma. 100% your husband should respect that it’s a trigger for you however it is not his responsibility to walk on eggshells around your unresolved trauma. Maybe he could support you going to therapy or join you for a session or two to gain a better understanding of how talking about porn and such affects you.
Anxiety,fmjmgm4,t3_fvods9,1586133287.0,It’s lessened both the severity and number of panic attacks I have in any given month. Sometimes it makes everything taste like metal for me though
dogs,fm182co,t3_fsg4jh,1585673679.0,"I have a 16 month old shih tzu who was purchased with similar intentions to assist me in my panic disorder and anxiety disorder relief. He also showed a lot of anxious tendencies and when separated when I went to uni or work he would mess in his crate or be destructive to my belongings. From my experience I found two things that helped: 1) I got him a “thunder shirt” which is just like a weighted vest but more like a constant hug that helps to ground anxious animals. I put it on him before I leave for work or school or if I’m busy at home doing homework and he settles down and seems much more relaxed and 2) (and I know this might sound counterproductive) but I got a second small dog so he had a companion. 

Since getting my second pup he has changed drastically. He’s become my snuggle lazy content little guy and so long as he knows where his buddy is (as my second pup is much more outgoing and independent and likes to play with her own toys and do her own thing) he’s happy. He hasn’t messed once in the house since we got her in Oct and while adjusting to having two dogs was a bit tough at first given I was training a new puppy and socializing her while still working with my older dog I honestly can’t imagine it any other way now.

If getting a second dog isn’t an option maybe consider a kitten so that he still has a companion and the cat grows up with a dog in the house? Or try taking him to an off leash fenced in dog park for some socialization with other dogs. Before bringing my second dog home I would take my older dog to the dog park every day and while he’s still nervous around new dogs he’s come a long way to the point where he will do his own thing at the park so long as he can still see me. 

Hope this helps ! Don’t give up just yet and if you need any other help shoot me a message."
relationship_advice,flvlw5s,t3_frg8dw,1585526703.0,From your explanation it doesn’t sound like he has dealt with the hurt he felt from the relationship. This doesn’t mean he necessarily wants to get back with the girl but sometimes a break up can leave people feeling very insecure and it can lead to someone questioning their self worth or what they did wrong and such. Some people just take longer to get over these things it doesn’t necessarily mean he doesn’t enjoy being with you or isn’t committed. However if you’re bothered by it (which I totally understand as I would be too) that’s valid and you should have a discussion with him letting him know how you’re feeling in the situation and ask him if he needs any help with his emotions as a result of the breakup

relationship_advice,flive7y,t3_fp3w4u,1585191651.0,Honestly this is very abusive and controlling behaviour. If you’re going to be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t trust you that’s a problem.
oddlyterrifying,fld583s,t1_fld4qi1,1585056855.0,This is a video of a really severe abdominal hernia   It’s where internal organs like your intestines move past a weak spot in your abdominal muscles and then get stuck. Usually they have to be surgically put back in place and the abdominal muscles would be either sewn together where the hole is or a mesh type contraption would be placed to avoid future hernias
relationship_advice,fjzrsr0,t3_ffp11z,1583727399.0,"I don’t know if this is the best time and place to do so. I’m all for you coming out and letting your family know who you truly are and see that you’re happy but this is a special day for your little brother and I think of you give a speech and make his day about you it might put major strain on your relationship with him. 

My advice would be to come up with a neautral day or time to give your announcement so that your brother gets his special day and gets to spend time with you (as he obviously wants to if he invited you) and you can still reach your goal at another time"
relationship_advice,fg87xjd,t1_fg87fec,1580611911.0,"Texting that you’ve arrived safely somewhere and having to “check in” with your partner when you’re out with friends are two very different things. One is about safety and the other is about control. If you can’t trust that your partner is making good decisions when you’re not there then you shouldn’t be with them. You can’t control anyone else’s actions and trying to will only cause resentment to build up and mistrust to form. 

I agree with others saying that if you know you’re not comfortable with partying and drinking then you should look for a partner who shares those values."
relationship_advice,fdinioe,t3_ell9cy,1578446864.0,"Honestly I think the best approach you can take here is to sit him down and tell him your relationship is being strained by him struggling and that you will support him in whichever way he wants to approach the problem to work it out but that you need him to acknowledge and tackle the issue in some manner as it is negatively affecting those around him. 

Having yourself experienced the difficulty and frustration that is depression make sure you convey to him that this isn’t his fault and that you still love him but that it wouldn’t be healthy to continue in the manner he is. Using past times where he supported and helped you through a depressive episode as examples to his strength and successful abilities to tackle such issues might also empower him to feel he’s capable of taking the next step. 

Therapy isn’t for everyone this is true but for him to have someone outside of yourself to vent his frustrations to would help also in terms of making him feel like he’s not putting extra stress on yourself who also struggles from time to time with depression. Even an animal to talk to or that he can take for rides and vent to and know his frustrations are held in confidence might help.  

Best of luck to you both !"
relationship_advice,fczp67r,t1_fczo0hd,1578106120.0,I agree. If you’re moving into a place where animals are already established then that’s an issue you are creating for yourself so if you don’t like animals and don’t want to live coinciding with animals then don’t move in. It would be different if you were all living together and then one of you wanted to bring animals in but that’s not the case here.

relationship_advice,f9feaj0,t3_e4uxlt,1575268282.0,"Honestly I would be honest with your dad what’s going on and the situation and you want to give her a safe stable place to live. 

It’s her choice as she’s over 18 to report anything and to be honest if your dad is just a basic good person I don’t think he’ll say no. 

Just make sure the two of you don’t take advantage of the situation. Especially with all your gf is going through she might find support in some professional help or need some serious time to process and heal. 

Hope it goes well and update if you can !"

dogs,f8vz3hq,t3_e2jqsg,1574880118.0,"I have two shitz tzu mixes in my two bedroom apartment and they fit and live very well in the space. They are a non shedding and hypoallergenic breed as well as if you’re consistent with them from day one won’t bark. Both of my pups don’t bark unless startled so they never bother our neighbors. 

I have a similar work schedule and school schedule as you so mine are also kennel trained we were aren’t home just so they are safe and out of mischief. They are a very affectionate breed and become like a little fluffy shadow wherever you go so I would greatly recommend the breed. They also live quite long compared to some other breeds and generally the only health issue prevalent in the breed is declining eye sight with age which is manageable. 

Bigger dogs are always amazing too don’t get me wrong but for the space you’re describing you might want to start your fur family journey with a small breed who would better fit the space with their smaller need for exercise and such. That being said as soon as I have the space I’ll be adding a bigger breed to my family too so I understand the struggle haha"

plants,f5dm8qj,t3_dnonq1,1572155972.0,The core of the plant looks extremely healthy and well so ya I’d just put it higher and see how it fares. I had tried to cut off the brown part but then the ends where I cut off just turned brown so I just left it alone and it kind of recuperated on it’s own
plants,f5dlh1s,t3_dnonq1,1572155622.0,It’s likely given the spotting of the brown spots. They don’t have to actually eat the leaf to get high just bite into it so I had to put mine up where he couldn’t get to it.

ChoosingBeggars,f0h7xub,t3_d4qum6,1568615067.0,That’s such an adorable gift. I would cry if someone surprises me with flowers or even a silly happy note just to know they were thinking about me
depression,ewpr9j0,t3_cpidz8,1565647483.0,"This is exactly how I feel most of the time too. It’s nice to see that someone feels the same way honesty although I wouldn’t wish the feeling for anyone because it’s terribly uncomfortable to feel. 

For me what helps is I found something that makes me feel safe (my little service dog Oscar and before I got him I carried my favourite little snake plant around with me) and I feel slightly more at home and comfortable having something of mine that is special to me with me."
