whatsthisworth,exijec9,t3_ct081m,1566329536.0,"This, as you have probably guessed, is a print.  (Duh😊)

Possibly done at his atelier by his students if it is real. 

(more valuable if so.) 

The real value in the case of a print, is more often the signature.

IF, it is actually signed, and not a facsimile signature, using a loupe, (15 power) check to see that it is not a printed signature; If you see tint dots it is printed and probably worth $40.00 or less.

If it is indeed signed, the signature could also be a forgery. Also, if no dots look to the type of paper, it must be acid free. Short run copies such as yours are still done on acid free stock.

It is possible to be a Chinese counterfeit, very popular among the lower middle class in China.

If it passes know that these were usually bought in blocks by fancy investment folks to make a killing on “Famous art”

They usually bought the prints unframed, and sold them at investment seminars and clubs. The prices they paid would be around $300.00 to $400.00. They then sold from $600.00 to $4,000.00 . 

Source made my own prints, studied the print arts (and business) at university.

Caution, I am not an expert..... even the “ experts” are easily fooled.

Art investment pieces are best purchased from licensed an bonded art studios with a complete provenance

Your question here should one of many steps in proving its value.

Good luck😊"
