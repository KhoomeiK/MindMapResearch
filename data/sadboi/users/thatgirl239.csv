unpopularopinion,fr56uv2,t1_fr455uc,1589903535.0,"I will say 9/11 hits close to me because I’m a volunteer firefighter. I was 9 when the attacks happened. My dad was a volunteer fire chief at the time. I remember freaking out because my child brain determined that *he’d* have to go to NY (we’re in western PA) and that he could die. 

It also has an affect on me because those firefighters did something I can’t imagine facing. I’ve read firsthand accounts and it weighs heavily on me. I’ve never read/heard of a worse incident. You don’t go into a burning building *assuming* you will die. They put their names on their equipment with markers so their bodies could be identified. I know obviously that firefighting is dangerous but I could never imagine a call like 9/11. It’s not supposed to be a suicide mission. It had a huge impact on the firefighter world and I don’t think it’s without good reason. 

Also, we can only consider the atrocities that *we know of*. I can’t imagine what else has been done but we’ve definitely done worse than what the average American assumes we’ve done to other countries."

But that she could go to the light. 

Then, in TLJ, Luke comments angrily how Rey immediately went to the dark when she reached out. Also implying she has an inclination to darkness. 

So the only thing I could figure is that Luke & Leia could feel the darkness within her? I feel like Palpatine spews a distinctive feeling of darkness. Dude is kind of intense.

My least favorite: the fact that Holdo wouldn’t at least tell Poe that there *was* a plan. There was no reason to not at least reveal that much. If only to give some reassurance. 

My favorite thing was the Kylo character. I think Ben is the most developed character throughout the trilogy, and we got to see a totally different side of him where he *did* disobey his master to save someone he cared about, if inexplicably. I was so excited when he killed Snoke because I thought it meant he was going to turn. Definitely added some death to his character."
