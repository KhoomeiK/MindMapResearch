I too feel like my abuser encouraged me to be the person I am today in so many good ways, as well as bad, so I just have to try and remember the good things he taught me. But it's definitely hard to banish those bad things he engrained into me.
I'm actually okay considering the state of things, I work in an 'essential' workplace, so the fact I have work to go to is helping me hugely. But I have had a pretty major relapse lately which could be linked to anything, so I'm super grateful for the job I have to go to and distract myself.
Hope you find some thing to take your mind of these things. I know this sounds mega lame but dude, Lego is the bomb. it is so good for distraction and anxiety etc. If you can afford it, buy yourself a set that looks enticing to you and build that mofo. So good and therapeutic!"

For example I had a massive panic attack at work the other day, my boss knows that's what happened and knows I'm been super down ever since, but doesn't know the root cause is CSA. So I feel like it's not taken as seriously because ""everyone"" suffers from anxiety these days.

I had a mother who genuinely cared so much about her kids, but she was a weak personality and gave into my strong willed father so never stopped the physical and emotional abuse he showed us (he never sexually abused me) but this lead to me being vulnerable to positive attention from an older man and low and behold, being sexually abused by him when I was only 13. And yes, I also felt like I couldn't say no to his sexual advances because I didn't want to offend the only older male who'd treated me like a princess, I craved that attention.

I too was 14 and believed I was in love with a man in his 20's, but there was always a part of me that knew it was wrong. 90% of our 'relationship' was online, so it wasn't till we were together in real life that the reality of it hit me and I realised I definitely didn't want this. I think what I was really in love with was the attention and the idea that an adult man thought I was mature/cool enough to 'fall in love' with.
For 10 years I believed it was me who was at fault, that I'd brought it on myself, that I drove the relationship. I've recently come to realise this could not be true, a 13/14 year old does not have the maturity to consent to an adult relationship, it's just not physically/biologically possible.

CPTSD,fmaqmhk,t3_fu2dhp,1585903929.0,"Okay so I've written a letter, now I'm just struggling with the idea of actually giving it to him. I feel like I'm about to change my life forever. I've lived with this secret for so long I'm struggling with the idea that someone else will know this part of me now."
adultsurvivors,fmal9tv,t1_fmaiit8,1585898079.0,"Thank you, it's comforting to know I'm not alone in this situation.
Good luck with yours too!"
adultsurvivors,fmah70s,t1_fmafz0o,1585894016.0,"I'm working on writing him a letter right now, thanks :)"
CPTSD,fmafkto,t1_fmaf91c,1585892513.0,"Wow, that's amazing. That's everything I want to say. Thank you so much!!!"
Anxiety,fm6elch,t1_fm4flfh,1585792344.0,"Ohh okay, yes that's not helpful at all."
Anxiety,fm4d8wn,t1_fm3ifpr,1585751829.0,"Absolutely agree with all of that! And maybe if you don't truly need 2 pairs, consider selling the old pair to someone who can't afford a new pair, or even donating them to someone in need? Doing good deeds does wonderful things for your mental health :)"
Anxiety,fm4cuqc,t3_fsp2mn,1585751604.0,"I totally get this and hate when people say that to me as well. But out of genuine curiosity, what would you prefer people to say to you? Tbh I don't know what I want people to say to say to me that would help me in those situations."
adultsurvivors,fm3u46q,t1_fm3mu16,1585737089.0,"Oh my gosh that's so horrible, what an awful person ‚òπÔ∏è 
I'm glad you were able to move past it! Yes I totally get that, I was so nervous about going back to the shopping centre after that time, but I too went back with my boyfriend and I kinda just starting joking about it and that helped me. I always use humour as a way to get through things."
Anxiety,fm3tvx5,t1_fm3lnbw,1585736836.0,"Good for you! Getting a job in retail was honestly the best thing I could've done for my social anxiety, it's helped me immensely."
adultsurvivors,fm3tsu1,t1_fm3n09p,1585736740.0,"Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I had work again today and although I was stressing about it for a few hours, things seemed fine so I think I was just over thinking it and I'm feeling a bit better now!"
adultsurvivors,fm3jdpe,t1_fm33wap,1585725579.0,"That's a good idea, thanks.
I have been back there since and I do get pretty anxious about going there but I think that's now because I link it to the fact that I had a panic attack there."
adultsurvivors,fm2ybkm,t1_fm0klmr,1585708303.0,"Mmm yes that's a little easier to say I think. Thank you, I'll work on different variations of what I could say along those lines üòä"
Anxiety,fm2x7sr,t1_fm0dvqw,1585707536.0,"Wow yeah that made my anxiety about it feel much better...thanks. just didn't realise that was an offensive thing as I know lots of people with said disorder and that's just a normal thing to me?? It's not like I said it in an offensive manner, it was merely an observation..."
adultsurvivors,fm0kl5k,t1_fm0kbez,1585660249.0,"Thank you!! Your words have been so wise and helpful, I will remember them when I take the leap and tell him üòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
adultsurvivors,fm0iioh,t1_fm0g46g,1585658707.0,"Thank you, that is quite helpful actually. Something I also struggle with though is actually using the word 'abuse', tbh I still find it hard to call it that, even though from everything I've read it is pretty text book abuse, I still feel like that word is too heavy for me to use."
adultsurvivors,fm0f979,t1_fm0etyo,1585655945.0,"I've considered that...still an option. Would love to be able to tell him face to face though tbh. Also struggling with how much to tell. I don't want to go into heaps of detail, but I don't want to be too vague either."
adultsurvivors,fm0f0fp,t1_fm0efsf,1585655721.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words. I'm sure you are right, I'm also a bit worried his response is going to be laced with pity and I can't stand being pitied. But you are right, if there's one thing I don't doubt in myself and us, is that he loves me. I'm lucky to have that and to know it and believe it.
As scared as I am, I sort of can't wait for it to finally be out in the open, I feel like it's the first step towards being able to be my true self in front of people, which is something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time!
Thank you again so much."
