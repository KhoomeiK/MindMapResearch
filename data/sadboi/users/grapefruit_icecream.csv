It is really important to identify which people in your life have the capability to be supportive, and which don't. Start with a small disclosure, and see how they respond. I have 3 female friends that I have disclosed an issue to, and that is enough to make me feel supported.

I was diagnosed with cancer last year (treatment is complete now, pretty much.) and it has made me very intentional at seeking support. Some people just are not able to be supportive, or don't know how to. I ask for what I need, and if the person can't or does not want to provide it, I move on and find someone who can. None of it is personal. 

Also, you don't have to tell them you have PTSD. There may be some simpler information that they can understand/relate to more than a diagnosis - you were in an abusive relationship and you are scared/nervous/reticent to date again, for example. A lot of people assume PTSD is flashbacks and some sort of visible distress. I have PTSD with no flashbacks ever, no visible distress. Just hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts.

The treatments and procedures being suggested are extensive, and have known side effects that are potentially horrible. At the time I had my surgery, the potential for radiation, chemo, estrogen blocking meds, ovary removal, and *strongly recommended* double mastectomy was overwhelming. I have since  completed radiation (""not that bad""), don't need chemo, and won't be doing a double mastectomy. I found some of the doctors to be fairly insistant on the mastectomy, I got a new team. I am much  less overwhelmed now.

A 1"" tumor is ""not that bad."" There is a possibility that it is *currently* contained, and that a lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node procedure (or even without the sentinal lymph node procedure) could contain the cancer for years, decades, or even permanently. 

Have you seen the report from the biopsy? The grading and estrogen sensitivity data will tell a lot about how agressive it will be. I think the thing to do right now is to make her feel as supported as possible, and make sure she has as much choice as possible. A therapist for you, to help you learn active listening ASAP, and a joint therapist if she will agree. 

I am wondering if you could get her to consult with a female surgical oncologist. Try to explain the situation in advance to the doctor, if possible. The oncologist *has to* strongly suggest the sentinal lymph node procedure, but you can be there to back your wife and say ""this is my wife's choice, to do the sentinal procedure or not, I am here to support her, and I hope you will be willing to help her even though you don't understand her decision."" They *have to* offer an MRI with contrast, but they can operate without that. 

Unless the cancer is grade 3 and/or triple negative,you have time to talk her into this. (Gently)

I was treated for stage 1 breast cancer in the past year, including doing radiation treatment during the Covid-19 lockdown. I have been very consistently impressed by the compassion, professionalism, and ability to provide reassurance of the many, many nurses and other medical practitioners I have dealt with since the diagnosis. It must be devastating to have to provide bad news, interact with people who are newly diagnosed or have a new complication, or to have to answer questions related to end of life situations, especially during covid-19. I am sure the anxiety of your patients is making things harder for you. I did not do chemo, but that must be a very difficult choice for patients to make right now. I have no idea how the nurses handle this, my only guess is that nurses who go into oncology are self-selecting for very high levels of compassion. 

I am not a therapist, but ... I have had lots of experience as a client...

First, evidence-based medicine suggests that depression is most effectively treated with a combination of meds and therapy. SSRI meds have fairly low side effects and are very effective for *helping* with stressful situations like you are experiencing. I would guess that the nurse practitioner would prescribe something for you, if she/he felt it was appropriate. Lexapro and Prozac are 2 common choices, Prozac is a strong inhibitor of cyp2d6, which means there are interactions with a bunch of other drugs, something to keep in mind. Lexapro has fewer interactions, just FYI. 

At the first appointment, my guess is that she/he will ask about what prompted you to come in, your coping mechanisms, your social support, other risk factors, and any past medications or mental health diagnosis. I am not sure how much talk therapy a nurse practitioner would do, compared to a therapist. Definitely seeing an NP is a good choice for moving forward with a solution to your current significant anxiety. 

There are some volunteer psychiatrists (?) available for free telephone consultation for covid-19 health workers. Maybe someone has a link to that?

There is also crisis text line (text home to 741741) which has trained volunteers available 24/7. 

Finally, there are a few apps you can try for grounding/calming activities. These apps are great when you find the right one for you:

* Headspace (paid)
* What's up? (Free)
* Panic Shield (Free)
