I like the style of no future, but its not as cohesive as vertigo, or especially End Credits. I just love the flow from song to song in End Credits. There's no filler tracks and every song perfectly connects thematically or whatever you want to call it. My only gripe with ityttmom is that it is the most ""poppy"" album, especially XO. My favorite thing about EDEN is his lyrical depth, and many of the tracks on that album are a bit lacking in that department."

That is until I discovered my love for photography. I learned that I have a pretty good eye, and I followed online tutorials and guides to take better photos. I believe I will learn more and get more experience working for 4 years than going into a very expensive, broken, for-profit college system. If I was going into any other field, like stem, I would be going to college. But in my case, its not worth it. And the people around me seem to hate that (except my parents, they support my decision). Going to college is shoved down our throats for years so that it seems like the only path. And whenever someone asks where I'm going to college, and I say I'm not going to college, they always say ""Ohhhhh...."" as they get a slightly sour face.
