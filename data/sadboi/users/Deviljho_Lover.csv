I discovered him in 06 through Audioslave and was impressed about his songwriting and vocals and after 2012 (during the 1st avenger movie credits) I just discovered that he was the frontman of Soundgarden. I dug all of his works from SG, TotD, Solo until his last work, ""The Promise"" and was so eager that 2017 will be a blast since they were in the plans of reuniting Audioslave, new SG album, anniversary of TotD and just after 5 months he died. I was left hanging for the things he could've show to me but his chapter just ended. I was devastated for the whole year and it still lingers until now. I haven't seen him in live yet. For a short amount of time, he was so influential to me (we share the same birthdate) and my life as most of his music was there for me during my dark moments as I grew up. I still can't accept why he wasn't revered as the grunge icon and most of the time he was underrated."
