mentalhealth,fltja7m,t1_fltbh4c,1585475297.0,"Yeah I've talked to my mom a lot about it and she told me she'd try to change but they forget it very easily. It's gotten worse when my dad and sister were forced to stay home, they both get so cranky so easily now. 

My anxiety ""began"" about seven years ago and it lead to me having stomach pains every day at school, and it wasn't even that bad before last three years. I had to switch to evening school where adults can go and young people who can't attend normal school (I'm in a school that could be called a high school because of students' age but it's way harder than high school). Last year I was completely exhausted after years of fighting almost all by myself and now I'm still just trying to relax so I could get better. I didn't realise healing could take so much time."

mentalhealth,flsf52r,t1_flrpd05,1585440728.0,"We live in Finland where the school system is a bit different, but she is 11 and on 5th grade in here. She is young but she has to do everything online now, and it's twice as hard for her because she really needs to be in class where she can get extra help. I understand why she is stressed right now, but it's very hard for me to help her, she wants to be as independent as possible even when she needs help.

My mom still goes to work, like to the actual working place so she doesn't always have the time to be with me and my sister, and my dad uses all of his energy to try to keep his work running. My sister goes to school different time than me and then she spends the whole day in her room alone, talking to her friends on the phone (hecking preteens), and she doesn't join us until the last minute before she gets punishments for not obeying (coming to eat dinner, doing her homework early etc).

We sometimes watch TV together, except for my sister who isolates herself more than even necessary. And everyone else here seem to love arguing, my sister and mom are very loud and fiery and my dad just always thinks he's right, and then there's me who just has to listen to everyone yelling about stupid things and it hurts me. I hate the negativity I feel around me, in my own home.

The fact that I can't go to school now is great for me, I hate going there. It's just very exhausting to hear arguments and fighting all the time and it doesn't help my already existing anxiety."

mentalhealth,flrhrwt,t3_fqib8w,1585420469.0,"I'm actually quite good with this situation, but my sister and dad are a big problem for me. My dad's on a bad mood all the time even though we're so alike but I guess it's because he has to work from home and can't do everything properly. My sister has to sit in front of a computer screen the whole day because of school and homework and it makes her tired, which makes her angry and lose her temper very easily. My mom and I are okay with being home for weeks, but it's hard to not get my feelings hurt when my dad or sister get mad so easily, I'm already a very shy and peaceful person so it's a bit of a hard time now."
mentalillness,flquqzh,t3_fq3rec,1585406677.0,"Same here. I'd do anything to be healthy and normal again, but it takes time. I just have to be patient and continue working on myself every day. It has gotten better for me since I actually got help and got a medication, but the main reason I am little bit better now is that I fought my own thoughts and decided to take back the control. 

I forced myself to see the good things and write them down, and today I can finally see the same beautiful world I saw as a kid. Doesn't mean that I'm not hurting daily, or that I'm completely fine. It's just easier to fix myself when I see all the beautiful and good things to hold on for. I suggest you do the same, it isn't easy for everyone but even one little good thing can help you through a lot."
