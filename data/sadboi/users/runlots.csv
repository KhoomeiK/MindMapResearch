CrazyHand,fr21wqv,t3_glwd4p,1589829740.0,"Hey, 29 here too, I feel like we're both in the same boat. I started going to local weeklies in January before I bought a Switch and I was the oldest and worst player there. Most people there were 18-22 year old university students with the odd high schooler in attendance. Not my usual crowd! But it's cool, I made a few friends and got some helpful pointers right away.

No one there grew up with 64 like I did (spamming thunder and fair with a birthday hat pikachu haha). Some players there were active on the Melee side of the club, but, judging from their age and controllers, many were coming from Smash 4. A game I had only played once. The last time I took Smash seriously, I was on allisbrawl.com losing a lot with Jigglypuff on the site's ladder system. Because Nintendo's online system on the Wii was bad. Imagine that!

I gave up playing seriously when I moved out to go to school. I made some friends who would play beer-fueled four-player free-for-alls in Melee and Brawl. It was great. I never bought a WiiU and more or less gave up videogames by that point. A lot of games just don't appeal to me anymore.

Smash Ultimate and the Switch changed that for me. It's not the same as when I was a kid, but that's okay. It feels good and right. 

As far as reflexes go, yeah, I can't match the young guys. It feels stupid to complain about age at 29 because otherwise my physical body still feels fantastic, but I guess this is the first thing to go. Oh well. It's not like I was a twitchy CoD4 god in high school who has fallen from grace. It's not my aspiration to go all Ash Ketchum on this bitch but I'd like to enter a local and do a little better than 0-2, 0-2 lol. I'm just here to have fun and get some of that sweet sense of challenge and mastery.

I need to improve the technical side of my game, so I started using ssb.fit after I saw it posted here yesterday. If you missed that, definitely check it out. Sounds like you have higher aspirations than me and adding a little structure to your training routine will help a lot. I'm (trying to be) a more competitive runner and this is exactly the sort of thing I've been doing to train for that side of my life. Your results come from your daily routine. What do you value, and what little things are you doing each day that will help you get there? It isn't much effort to do on each specific day, but the cumulative effect of your consistency is powerful. Live your values, and your goals will get closer. You'll learn things, and know what needs to change in the future once you are further along. Keep going!"

I used to be on call, and when I was unwell, I missed a lot of work. At the time I was sick once or twice a week. Which if my math is right, works out to 24 sick days in 4 months. I would lie in bed and ignore my ringing phone until it stopped, and feel like trash for the rest of the day. It was an automated call, but still, sometimes a real person would call me saying what the fuck, we need you today. I don't work there anymore. 

I'm managing the illness better now, and my job is kind of fun, so I don't miss as much work. I don't work very many hours, which isn't great, but my health is a lot better. I think in an ideal world I would work 20-30 hours a week. Work 4 hours/day Monday-Friday at one job and do my fun demo job on the weekend/when I can. Gives me the time I need to take care of my body, run errands at off-peak times, volunteer, do my 10 hours/month of therapy and support group attendance, and avoid feeling rushed, all of which might help tame the fucking chaos inside my skull.

One criteria I have for future employers is that I trust them enough to be direct from the beginning about my bipolar. I'm not sure if that's the smartest policy but I think I would rather be unemployed a little longer than settle prematurely to work at a place that doesn't value my health and needs. I work in sales. So far I've been getting good results in limited opportunity. Continue that, and I'm going to get accommodated. It sucks that capitalism is this inefficient, only offering compassion to those who are less needy, but this is the garbage stage we're playing on. We have to work in one mode and vote in another. 

On disability - if you need it and you can get it, there's no shame in that. I don't know much about it because I haven't gone through the process - I've never applied because I don't think it's ethical for me to do so. But you should if it would make a difference to your life. If you don't get it the first time, don't worry, apply again. Most people I know who are on it today (in the Canadian province of Ontario) got it on their second application."

It's really easy to walk into smash attack you would never expect a good player to throw out, lose a stock, get tilted and lose the game.

The heart rate chest strap has since died and I haven't bothered to do anything about it, but I'm not going back. The data has been useful, coming from no tracking training. Strava has been really good for staying connected, now that I can't run with other people. Sometimes I run with just my thoughts, but I kind of like having music and audiobooks now. I stick one of those long iPod nanos in my shorts back pocket.

I can't imagine running with my phone in hand! If it works for you, to each their own, but no way would I do that. If I absolutely need to carry anything that size, I'm wearing one of those little hydration backpacks.

In my unprofessional opinion, you don't need to change anything. To reach your goals (or mine!) it is not necessary at all to use any of this tech. It's all about running consistently and intelligently enough to build fitness while not getting injured. This watch might aid you in intelligence, and you'll probably like it, but it isn't going to make you into the runner you want to be. You are going to do that.

Edit: went on the Garmin website to get up to date. JESUS. Get a used watch that's in good condition, unless you're secure enough financially that the money isn't a big deal. I'm looking at spending that much money on building a home gym, because that's what you have to spend to get quality shit. But on a watch like that? No. No no no."

running,foyr9g0,t1_foyox13,1588177707.0,"A good watch is useful! Ideally you want one that has the ability to set two different interval lengths. I have an old Garmin GPS watch and an even older Timex Ironman watch that has this functionality. But it's not necessary. Worst case scenario, you use the chrono function, do some mental math for when your interval stops/starts up again, and check it every once in a while. I prefer to just focus on sustaining the effort, and try not to let it get in my head how much longer I have to go. Run dumb, let the watch do the thinking for you.

There are cases where the interval lengths increase and decrease throughout the workout, so for that I have to use my big brain and do the math in chrono. But that tends to be an exception in my training. Alternatively, you can go to the track and do your intervals based on distance. There's lots of options :)"
running,foynbpb,t1_foyhos8,1588175614.0,"I always do HIIT with my running workouts but you could totally do intervals with other exercises. My bread and butter are minuters and two minuters.

And of course if you're really not feeling it, it's okay to stop earlier. Yesterday I felt like 12 one minuters were enough, so I finished the workout and did some form work on the grass. Sometimes you're 6 intervals in and your body says stop. That's okay! Listen to your body. When you're fitter you can set the minimum higher, but in early stages you just have to be patient with your fitness and accept its current limitations. 

If you're training more for distance, you will eventually want to do 3 or 4 or 5 minutes on, 90 seconds off. If at some point the recovery feels like too much (or too little), experiment with a shorter (or longer) recovery interval. Hope this helps!"

The cheat code to getting faster is high intensity interval training once or twice a week. Usually I start with minute on/minute off, but the goal is to do 10-20 minutes of work. Again, it's all about listening to what your body is telling you.

If you don't have one, I bought the official Switch SanDisk one and it was pretty cheap for what it is and it also came super quickly from Amazon (during a pandemic! Jeez). I spent a bunch of time seeing if I could get away with a cheaper card, but decided against it. 

Convert the replay you want to video. You can do this from your replay home. 

Method 1: You'll need the Nintendo Switch Online app. So go ahead and download that on your phone or tablet or whatever. Once your replay has been converted to video, post it. Open the Nintendo Switch Online app. Select Smash, and then the little profile icon in the bottom right corner. Select posts. There's your video! To share it, click the three dots in the top right corner of the video and select share to acquire your link. You're done!

Downsides to this: the video quality on the upload is not great. It's good enough for my purposes, but if you want better quality, choose method 2.

Method 2: I haven't done this myself yet, but here's what I understand from what I read last week. Power down your switch fully. Not just put it to sleep, you want a full power down. Then you can pull the MicroSD card from your Switch. If you don't do this properly, bad things might happen? I don't know. If you have a microSD reader, go ahead and plug your card into that. Find your replay in the folder. Upload to YouTube. The quality should be better than Nintendo's low quality upload from Method 1. You're done!

If you don't have a microSD reader, I think you can use your phone. But if your phone is anything like mine, it's a whole ordeal to find the little tool you need to eject the card thing to insert your Switch card into. I'll be using Method 2 in the future, once I have access to my USB SD card reader after quarantine ends.

Method 3: Capture card. I don't know anything about this, but I know for sure that lots of other people do. This is the end of the post."

worldnews,fof62f9,t1_foezimf,1587727292.0,"That's a good point. I didn't think of the prison angle. Some people thrive in prison partly because it has a limited sort of UBI. If you also don't have to worry about shelter or where your next meal is coming from when you're on the outside, maybe that changes the economics for some criminals. Of course you're always going to have people spending all of their government money on drugs and doing petty crimes to support it beyond that, but obviously this isn't something a person addicted to drugs can sustain for very long before getting caught and then losing all of that sweet UBI.

That brings up an interesting concern though - if some people are going to buy drugs no matter what, the price of harder drugs is going way up under UBI. In jurisdictions where marijuana is legal, black market weed will still be cheaper than legal weed because of its legitimate competition. So it'll continue to be a less profitable 'loss' leader for drug dealers. So maybe one of the undesirable effects is that the drug empires become more powerful? If you smoke it and were to live somewhere that 1) doesn't have a legal source and 2) was also going to start a UBI program, well, you're about to experience some economics.

It's interesting that you bring up domestic abusers! UBI would actually hurt them in some cases. If the source of their power over their victim comes from  fact that they have income and their victim has none, that power dynamic changes. It won't stop all abuse, but this is a common one and could mean freedom for some people."

fican,fo3one1,t3_g5haxg,1587490407.0,"That Montreal comment is great. We were going to spend a weekend in Montreal in May to go to a concert and just enjoy the city. Obviously that's not happening anymore but definitely going to reschedule. The tickets in Montreal cost half of what I'd pay for a show in Ontario. Maybe because there's so much choice? I'm envious.

I grew up in KW, currently live in uptown Waterloo and it's pretty good. Does anyone have experience with Victoria? If I were to leave Waterloo that's where I think I'd go. [By housing affordability it's similar cost of living](https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/country_result.jsp?country=Canada) to Waterloo, but with even better lifestyle. The drawback is that getting to Vancouver from Victoria is more of a hassle than it is to get to Toronto from Waterloo. Here's my take on Waterloo, by your criteria:

Nature: You have a lot more driveable daytrip access to nature here, and the distance from Toronto is just enough to avoid some of Narcity effects. If your WFH schedule is more flexible, avoid weekends and definitely hit up these spots during the week. You'll get them almost entirely to yourself. It's great. 

Safety: it's safe.

Friends: A lot of my friendships have turned into distance relationships unfortunately. Students tend to leave after graduation, although you're in tech so you will find like minded people your age here. There's lots of career/social events for this crowd although I can't say I've made many deep connections through these. But I'm 29, we're in the same boat. You have to work harder to start friendships at this age regardless of where you live. Make it a priority to maintain the ones you already have and value. 

Access to entertainment: Proximity to Toronto is what you get here. There are a couple local concert venues but mainly I find myself driving to Toronto for this. So the same as what you're getting now. One day in the distant future the train service will improve enough to use for this purpose, but until then sadly the 401 is your best option. 

Walkable grocery stores/bars: Bars are very walkable in both Uptown Waterloo and Downtown Kitchener. At worst you might spend a couple minutes on the LRT. Grocery stores cater to drivers first, but there are a few options. If you're in uptown, Valumart and Vincenzo's are the most walkable. Central is pretty good in midtown but that's more of a transit option. There are asian stores sprinkled through both places, walkable depending where you are. The Saturday farmer's market downtown is my bread and butter and is always worth the trip. I do most of my grocery shopping by bike and it works well enough. This city is not ideal for cycling, but by Canadian standards it's acceptable and getting better. 

In summary Waterloo is... pretty good. If you end up wanting to work somewhere else, you have plenty of local options in addition to your remote opportunities. Cost of living is rising, but it's still a lot less than Toronto. My temporary living situation is ridiculous, I am 100 meters away from an LRT stop and the heart of the core, living with my partner and one other roommate, for $375/month. It's a cheap place to begin with, discounted because of the coronacrisis. Realistically you're looking at $1500/month for a decent 1 bedroom in a good location. Waterloo lets you stay relatively close to what you already have, while being its own distinct place. It isn't a Toronto satellite. I might leave one day but it's a nice place to live with a good balance of perks."

Oh, and I should point out that uair is her aerial that comes out fastest. 5 frame startup. 6 for fair, 8 for nair, 9 for bair. Maybe I should start doing that instead lol. Uair has the most landing lag (18 frames) and nair the least (9).

She has so much to work with, you just have to deal with (and not get put into) her really bad disadvantage state. Like any character, you have to be unpredictable, so work on that. B reverses and wavebounces will help make you more evasive and are super satisfying to catch people with. I'm still working on this.

If you're struggling with getting pressured up close, set traps. Place a bomb low to make them jump. Place it high when they expect you to place it low.  Always have a partial charge shot and whip it out/cancel often to remind them that it's there. Even just the animation of her arms going up is threatening. Make them stop what they're doing and shield. And if they do get through to you, DI away and pray. If you get an opening, sometimes a neutral air will free you. Up B out of shield is always an option, but if you rely on it too much you're going to take a beating. Her aerials are pretty awesome too. You can end stocks very early with a back air against players who insist on invading your personal space. 

Good luck and happy smashing!"

wholesomememes,fnizst4,t1_fnitodp,1586989310.0,"It's true, sometimes people do want solutions. But the problem with assuming everyone needs a solution is that it puts people who cannot explicitly ask for emotional support in a bad spot. If you're not incapacitated by your emotional state it's much easier to think clearly and advocate for yourself. When I'm at support group, the policy is don't give advice unless asked for. But you're always free to waive that by asking for it yourself. I ask for advice all the time. It's a good policy, it's oriented towards the more vulnerable, but you can override it when you need to. I wish we all had better mind reading powers and that everyone could get exactly what they need when they need it, but this is the best we can do."
wholesomememes,fnil9yj,t1_fnho3hw,1586981960.0,"""What you're feeling makes sense""

""That's a natural response considering what happened to you""

""I've felt that way too/I've been in your shoes before and it's difficult."" \[the problem with this one is that it's easy to continue on and derail the whole point of this by making it about yourself + offering unsolicited advice, so use carefully. I've been guilty of this A LOT and got called out on it\]

If you're dating someone and you INvalidate their feelings while they're vulnerable, well you might just get dumped. There's a time and place for criticism, and while someone is in a state of emotional distress, that ain't it. Here's an example, if you received this phone call from your partner:

""Hey... So I think my car got stolen and I'm FREAKING OUT. I don't know what to do and I can't go anywhere and there's no way I can afford to replace it and how am I going to get home or go to work tomorrow AHHHH""

A (maybe) well meaning, but invalidating response: ""Are you sure you didn't just forget where you parked it/Did you remember to lock the car, you know you forget sometimes/I told you to stay away from that sketchy part of town""

These are not helpful. There's no need to assign blame to anyone at this time. Feelings first, 'logical' talk later. It's illogical to do this in the wrong order! Though the logical crowd makes this mistake over and over and over again. Very logical ;) If this fictional person did happen to have a reputation for being forgetful and unconscientious, that's okay. Talk about it later when things have cooled off.

A more appropriate response might look like: ""Jesus! Are you okay? When you're ready I can pick you up/arrange a ride. Let's get you home, I'll make you a cup of tea and we can talk about it."""
wholesomememes,fnhurau,t1_fnhjuk1,1586969186.0,"It's not easy, at first! Takes some practice. Each conversation is different so you can't just robotically learn one all-purpose response routine and use that for the rest of your life. Which is why listening is important. When you're really stuck, you can always fall back on some variation of sorry for your loss/that sucks/I'm sorry that happened to you. And like, these aren't bad answers. I'm not qualified to say how effective they really are, I can just say what I've personally experienced. Anecdotally, I have noticed that these are sometimes conversation enders. Which maybe isn't the right choice in the current situation if someone isn't done processing their distress and needs you to be there to think out loud. Having someone to bounce thoughts off is valuable and I think it's a good idea to give that person the room to let the process play out.

What I like to do is ask questions. Ask about anything they're talking about. If there's a part of their story that seems important or missing detail or even if it's just interesting to you, ask. What you say can be as simple as ""Tell me more about \[x\]."" It helps because 1) it shows you're listening and 2) which shows through your own actions that you care.  This is what support is. Listening while caring. Actions that show you care and are listening are much more powerful than simply stating that you are 'here for them' or something along those lines. So ask relevant questions. As a friend or partner to this person, this is what is wanted from you. And sometimes, once they've exhausted working through everything, this helps: ""Man, that sucks. I'm grabbing ice cream from the freezer, do you want some too?""

If the situation is more serious, like maybe this person is experiencing suicidal thoughts - you want to act not exactly like but similar to how a model bystander behaves in a physical injury first aid scenario. You talk to them to try to deescalate the immediate distress/panic/racing thoughts/the urgency of doing something drastic and dangerous. And then you 'call for help.' You talk with them about what steps we need to take next for a professional to take over. Whether that's making a plan to see their therapist as soon as possible. A doctor's appointment. Going to the emergency room. Calling a distress line. There's a lot of options.

Hope this helps!"

1) Paul Graham writes this from a silicon valley perspective, so keep that in mind.

2) I don't love his use of the word crazy.

3) I'm an atheist but I think he's wrong to say theology is an obvious waste of time.

4) Good things you do should not be automatically credited to illness. You did this. Good things you do should be credited to you.

5) I believe smartness and 'craziness' are separable. Treating your mental illness allows you to unlock the potential of what you have. Deliberately allowing illness to fester in the service of 'smartness' is... not smart.

Okay. Every time I visit this subreddit I see the spectrum of what bipolar disorder is. You never really know what type of post you're going to see next. Everyone here is at different stages of fighting it. There's a lot of beauty and kindness to be found here. It's a very good place.

Obviously blindly encouraging people suffering from bipolar to engage in risk taking behaviours is... bad. But everyone has to take risks every day, some larger than others, so I think it's possible to take big intellectual risks that will not lead to your physical harm while suppressing risks that could. Set those boundaries for yourself. Be safe, while scratching that itch to make big moves in a more controlled environment.

Peter Thiel (whatever you think about the person, let's keep discussion on his ideas) sometimes asks a fascinating question when interviewing job applicants:

[""What important truth do very few people agree with you on?""](https://fs.blog/2015/11/the-single-best-interview-question-you-can-ask/)

I think having an insightful answer to this question is critical for us to use what we have. Our lived experiences are different AND valuable. We will never be gods, but you are powerful. Someone with your illness described PHYSICS before anyone else did. What secret truths do you know?"

On relationship maturity - lots of people who are married don't know how they're supposed to behave in a relationship! I was 23 when a very patient woman taught me how to be a good man. Zero regrets. Before that I was neckbeard central. I had a lot of repairs to make. Don't get too hung up on the age things happen for you. It's not a competition. Here's some samples from my life: Age 12: entire lunchroom laughed uncontrollably when I couldn't define masturbation. Age 13: asked a girl out before my penis had awakened so that the Lil Timmys might stop calling me gay. Age 18: got manipulated into what I thought was a relationship but really was just a maneuver to make another boy jealous so that he'd take her back! Age 18-23: bitter. Extremely attractive..

Your 20 year old male peers don't know what they're doing either. Mostly just creating material for these women's therapists to sort out over the next few years. I know it feels like you're missing out - I was in a rush too! But trust me - now is the time to work on yourself. Work with a CBT therapist to get a handle on your bipolar while cultivating your listening skills. That's step one of being a good friend. Because after all, a relationship is not a foreign unknowable entity to those who have not been in one. You've been in friendships. A 'relationship' is just a special friendship.

I met my partner four years ago. I'm 29. There was no '# of relationships experienced' on her application. She went out with me because she wanted to find out if I was a genuinely kind and empathetic man. And fortunately that's what I had been working on! I moved in with her this week to quarantine together. Today I cut my own hair and sent her a picture while she was at work. I'm wearing a towel and a shit eating grin and my hair is making a puddle on the floor.

""Hahahahahahaha

I mean it doesn't even look bad 

I can't stop laughing

This is what our relationship is. We're best friends who get to have sex with each other. I'm going to marry the shit out of her. But it never would have happened if I didn't pour hundreds of hours into counselling trying to become the best version of who I am. I should also point out that it was NOT four years of smooth sailing. I tried (and failed) to break up with her last year so that I could kill myself in peace! Fucking bipolar, man.
