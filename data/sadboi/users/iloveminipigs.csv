logodesign,fppj21l,t3_gerv8p,1588803187.0, I think maybe the black eyebrows on the left hand option are throwing me off? Like I’m trying to read them as an important part of text. Maybe try them just in red too?

photoshop,fl782fn,t3_fn2c09,1584896269.0,"These were most probably created using Illustrator, not Photoshop. I suggest watching a tutorial for creating icons in illustrator? They have simplified down the characters to minimal lines and flat fills using key colours."
Anxiety,fl1jav7,t3_flvow6,1584730123.0,"Yeah! Your stomach is 100% an emotional organ. I get terrible acid reflux flare ups when I’m anxious which just makes me sick and makes my appetite none existent, but I try to force myself to eat plain foods."

photoshop,fkn7ksi,t3_fjicdp,1584356915.0,"Seems like they cut out the figure, made it B&W (if it wasn’t already) and increased the contrast, then used the ‘colour’ layer blending mode (on the layer below the figure) to paint in the yellow. To recreate the distressed splatter textures you could either find a brush which mimics that effect or import an image of some splatters and layer it on top. Again, layer blending modes will affect how it interacts with the layers beneath, hence why some are grey and some are white."

photoshop,fkcfag2,t3_fhoqzy,1584051864.0,"Either resize the image or export it at a smaller size, I guess the second option is better as it’s none destructive. You should just be able to type in the desired size when exporting it."
