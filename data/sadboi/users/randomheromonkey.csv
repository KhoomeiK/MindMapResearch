autism,fm1wd09,t1_fm1qt13,1585686193.0,"I don’t know your son. I’ll create a scenario that may not match your son’s present or future.

Imagine you are being raised by beings that look like you. They do a whole bunch of things that don’t make much sense, but you want to be like them. You try but sometimes they get angry, or sad, or don’t react the way you would in a growing number of situations. You copy the things around you the best you can. You do your best to understand. Sometimes you get urges that you get strange looks for. Moving yourself or objects in certain ways that they don’t or wouldn’t. You decide that you can just do those things when they aren’t around.

As you grow, you become pretty good at being like every one else. You become so good that few know that you are different. Sometimes people still get angry or uncomfortable. It could be because you are maintaining eye contact for too long... or maybe not long enough. It could be because you are shaking your hand back and forth as they’re talking... for no other reason than because you’re nervous. You laugh at things that are hilarious... but sometimes nobody else notices them. Your parents won’t believe you that the shirt is uncomfortable because the fabric scratches at your skin. Your grandma will get upset that sometimes you spin in circles for too long. She’ll stop inviting you over because “something isn’t right with that boy”. If you are surrounded by the wrong people, you may become so used to them not believing you that you will stop sharing things that are true for you. The mask is not something you will necessarily be aware of. It forms as you learn the rules that these beings need to accept you as one of their own.

Being different does not mean that he won’t try to copy you and learn from you. It means that he often won’t properly learn WHY you do the strange things that you do. Be different than my parents. Believe what your child says unless there is a good reason not to. Teach your child until you have nothing left and always accept their quirks. There may be a lot of them. Learn from them what it’s like being them. They may surprise you and that is a good thing... not a bad thing.

Thanks for wanting to learn."

BPD,f94kw4i,t3_e3kybl,1575091802.0,"I was raised in an environment where what I felt didn’t matter. What I knew didn’t matter. My ideas were flawed and never well thought out. Everything that was me was invalid. I was hurt by every person who should have had my back. Then I was convinced that the early anxiety and trauma symptoms were all “just” adhd. I believe my child self was forced to adapt to an unnecessarily harsh world. I’m never sure though.

It is extremely difficult to have faith in anybody. They, like every example my child self experienced, will eventually show their true colors. They will do one thing and say another. In the end, the problem likely comes from having no base reference point as to what trust looks like.

I’ll put it one other way... I experienced love so late that when it hit me I didn’t know what to do with it. It was like I had been given the gift of sight having been blind my whole life. It overwhelmed me. Nothing was familiar. I didn’t know which me I needed to be to make it continue. Everything that happened would be analyzed by some part of me that I’m still only partially aware of: The constant lingering question... am I still safe?"
