depression,fhdh4gy,t3_f2livb,1581486152.0,"I took it that the OP wasn't being arrogant it's just that he wishes he didn't think about things so much? A sort of ""Ignorance is bliss"" type of thing but not calling others ignorant in a derogatory way? Just that they don't overthink things the way he perhaps does?

I could be completely wrong though? I just took it that he wishes he perhaps didnt over analyse things so much or rather too much. I hasten to add I am NOT intelligent at all. So have no doubt got this completely wrong.

It's just sometimes I myself have overthought things so much that I ended up not even trying them out because Ive neen nitpicking too much e.g. ""What if I do this and it goes wrong and this happends or that happens?"" When the reality is that the negatives, whilst possible, are extremely unlikely.

For example people might want to go skiiing but then think about what happened to Michael Schumacher and therefore not bother? But when you look at the flip side he competed in one of the most dangerous (if not the most dangerous) sport in the world and I think the worse that happened was that he got a broken leg but turned out to be the best racing driver of all time.

I just took it that he wishes he was like most people and didnt overthink things to the point of not even wanting to attempt something new? (as an example of over analysing)"

We cant all be Einstein but it doesn't mean that we can't try. Even if after a while we dont see much progress this can sometimes lead us on to other things e.g. some people who started off trying to play guitar ended up being drummers or even singers.

Or some people who wanted to be actors ended up writers, producer or directors or even all of the above.

Just because someone isnt smart doesnt mean they cant be good at something. Sometimes it's just trying enough things to find out what we are good at or more importantly enjoy. Sure the two often come together but please give it some time and try some new things and with a bit of luck you will find something that gives you pleasure.

Im as dumb as a box of rocks but for me it's movies. Sometimes you can go 10 movies before you actually see something worth watching or something you can get into but then that hour and a hlf to two hours can take you out of your life. 

You are still young and there are many things that you can try that may capture your interest. It doesnt need to be movies, it can be reading, computer games, taking up a kind of game i.e. you dont need to be smart to play poker or even chess for that matter. You dont need to be good at these things and often at first you will stink the place out but it doesnt matter if you are not good its about finding something you enjoy and often in time you improve and get more joy from it. Golf is another one. I've seen people who described golf as ""a waste of a good walk"" Im totally rubbish at it but just getting out in the fresh air with someone else can pass a few hours and take you out of your own head, just like any other activity or hobby.

ireland,fhcwdfb,t1_fhctqh0,1581472249.0,"Very good point! I offer my apologies for not being as specific as I perhaps should have been but that was partially my point when I mentioned about many people caught up in these things do not actually have any ill will against the so called other side.

I actually know people who signed up and subsequently left when they realised that the enemy, as it were, were just ordinary people like themselves who were caught up in something that they really wanted nothing to do with or at least did not want innocents to suffer.

I guess what I'm trying to say is you cannot sign up for the armed forces and then get to pick and choose which ""wars"" you fight in. Therefore as I tried to emphasise (but didnt do a very job of and im sorry for that) is that a lot of these conflicts are conflicts between Politicians, not ordinary people.

But in a lot of these cases when they realised they were fighting and often oppressing people like themselves, left as soon as they could. Life would be so much better if everyone could just get along!

Every Army and organisation has sadists unfortunately and these are the people that we tend to hear about rather than those on peacekeeping missions. Even so called peacekeeping missions, years later often end up having evidence of crimes against humanity from both world wars to the balkan wars to those in Africa and what had happened (and presumably is still happening) in Syria and places like that.

Often the true extend of such war crimes do not come to light until years or decades until after the actual conflict(s) have ended. It makes you wonder what would happen if the Politicians had to fight their own wars?"

It gets to the stage you cannot trust your own senses!

Even when I told her that the Tannoy (Public Address System) from the local Railway Station was actually addressing me...personally....rather than the general public and instead of informing the public of the next train on platform one or two, or of any delays etc it was actually talking to me and mentioning things that only I could know, all I got was an increased dose of anti-depressants!

Just look at the IRA, The UDA etc??? The vast majority of people killed by these, so called organisations, were innocent men, women and children who really had nothing to do with either sides ""war"".

You look at someone like Guy Fawkes...I'm not condoning his actions but at least he took his beef to the people who were actually his opponents. When the IRA blew up buildings, train stations and everything else....the vast majority of people who were killed or maimed were completely innocent.

From what I have read and from my ancestry, Irish Catholics (who esentially birthed and became the many Republican Movements) were treated like shit! However to then go after innocent men, women and children....who not only had nothing to do with their fight...but who often sympathised with their plight was unforgivable!

They were not alone. On the other side (UDA etc). It actually became arguable as to whether or not both organisations actually really wanted a United Ireland or to remain part of Britain (depending on their so called stance). Because if an agreement was reached  then there would be no excuse for the gun running, the drug dealing (which both sides lied about being involved in), prostitution, money lending, bank robberies and all round gangsterism that both sides were up to their neck in.

The sad thing is, most Brits and most Irish people (not politicians or leaders of paramilitary groups) just wanted what we all want. A quiet peaceful life for ourselves and our children.

It's an absolute travesty that so many innocent people who just wanted to get on with whoever they met, no matter where they were from in the world lost children, wives, husbands, friends and family members who had nothing to do with any so called war but just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Parents have a lot to answer for in terms of the biggotry and hatred that are bred into their offspring as well.Politicians are one thing. I'm not saying it's right to kill them, but to kill innocent men women and children just because they happen to live in a certain area, even though they have no allegiance to one side or another is cold blooded murder nothing more and nothing less.

Lets just hope the worst is behind us and that innocent hard working people dont have to worry about being shot or blown up just because they happened to be trying to put food on their families table in an area that people who have never worked a day in their lives deemed ""enemy territory"".

I wish you well man, hope things start looking up for you soon, not just with dating but in all aspects of life. All the best and take care :)"
depression,fgep5w5,t3_exzum9,1580705408.0,Hey can I ask what the no FAP thing is for? Please excuse my ignorance but what is it supposed to achieve? I'm assuming from the tone of the rest of your post that it's supposed to be beneficial but I guess I'm just asking.....in what way?
depression,fgeoc4v,t3_ey08gn,1580704718.0,"It's so strange I should read this as I was thinking along similar lines but with the opposite stance. On the one hand I think it would be really interesting if there was a God as it would bring meaning to a lot of things that currently have none. An afterlife, which would presumably then be a given if there was a God, would also be interesting.

However I would also find it terrifying as it could actually mean that we actually in a sense live forever :O:O:O Sad as it may seem the one thing that gets me through life and keeps me going is that some day it will be over and I mean permanently over i.e. lights out forever when all this suffering is over and Im either burned to a crisp or worm food. Either way it will finally be over."
depression,fgenxen,t1_fge4jx5,1580704385.0,"I'm sorry if I've picked you up incorrectly as your post is a little vague. For example ""Modern Society"" is a very expansive term.

It's just life is never going to be perfect; nor society. We cannot and never will be able to control everything around us either. Maybe instead of waiting or hoping that things that are perhaps largely, if not completely, outwith your control change....why not try and concentrate on things that you can control or at least do something about and try and find some contentment in those?

Not trying to tell you what to do or anything or how to live your life its just a suggestion and I fear you are correct in your statement about certain changes being unlikely to occur in your lifetime. I just think it would be a shame to focus on these rather than divert your attention to something in which you could possibly find some degree of happyness?

All the best either way :)"
depression,fgenazm,t3_exyf26,1580703889.0,"I hate to say this but I believe there are some people who don't actually WANT to be happy. I personally cannot understand it because it's ALL I want. Not even to be happy (i'm not greedy) but I'd be satisfied with just being content.

However I've met people who almost seem to actually in a strange way go out of their way to be sad and melancholy. I'm not talking about someone who is even actually depressed. The only thing I can compare it to is.....have you ever met someone (for some reason they are usually elderly or certainly over 40) and it's almost as though they are not happy unless they are moaning about something? 

You can spot them a mile away because even if they do not have something to be moaning about or have something irking them then instead of being happy about this and enjoying the feeling (however temporary) of things actually going well what do they do? They go out of their way to try and actually find something to moan about go on a mission to find something that upsets them.

Almost as bad as all these snowflake, woke, virtue signallers with too much time on their hands that seem to be everywhere these days! I honestly think that some people are not happy unless they are unhappy and it pisses me off as a lot of us out their just want contentment and would be more than grateful for just that."
dating,fgem6u4,t3_exzlr1,1580703016.0,I have to preface this by informing you that I have never used online dating so basically I don't know what I'm talking about here. I'm only mentioning this because a girl I work with has been going out with a guy for a number of months that she says she met on a dating site called ...Match.com I think it was .com but not certain as I am in the UK so it could be .co.uk for Britain and a different extention for different countries....things seem to have went well for her using that site though?
childfree,fgelh0m,t3_exzpaw,1580702463.0,"I know what you mean. In my job it is very difficult to get time off. They want you to use your holidays by the end of the year but when you ask for a particular day or set of days off you rarely get it.

If it's because I've been too slow off the mark and by the time I ask for it, the quota in terms of the maximum people allowed off per day has already been met then I can understand this.

However if there is one more person allowed off before this magic number has been reached and I am told I cannot get it because someone with kids also wants it and she is prioritised or it might not even be me it may be someone else who is chilfree cannot get a holiday because someone with kids also wants it...it really pisses me off!

I mean if someone breeds they need to know that sacrifices have to be made when they create another human being. Sacrifices with their spare time, social life, finances, bodies etc but any sacrifices should be THEIR sacrifices. Why should other people suffer because of choices that a parent has made in terms of becoming a parent in the first place?"
depression,fgekk5w,t3_exynk6,1580701773.0,"I guess it's just life that quite often society just looks upon girls more favourably. I'm not even saying that it's necessarily a bad thing, not all the time anyway. I have always been a little confused with regards to the term ""equality"" though.

Not to go off at a tangent as it's not really depression related but sometimes it's like people who harp on about equality (and not all women do BTW) that they often only want equality when it  suits them and thats not just a gender thing it can be race, age etc too.

For example there are many things in life in where, without a doubt, equality does not seem to apply to guys. From things such as divorce settlements, custody of children, access to children, retirement age etc even right down to punishment and prison sentences for the exact same crime under the exact same set of circumstances, girls seem to be treated more favourably.

I guess it's like the old adage that when talking about equal treatment for all, that ""Some people are more equal than others"" lol."

I also agree with you about the bill thing! She may, at the time, have been planning on seeing you again or at least mulling it over and that's why she let you pay and could perhaps be one from making quick, almost snap decisions and then decided against it.

However if she knew all along that there would be no second date it is a bit of a liberty and taking advantage of your good nature to let you foot the whole check.

insomnia,fgegk6y,t3_exzq0y,1580699046.0,"I think the actual definition of insomnia is something like ""Having difficulty falling or staying asleep"" that's probably not 100% accurate but its something like that although im not sure if it has to persist for a particular period of time to ""qualify""

Your friend could just have a messed up sleep pattern. I have known people who have had sleep patterns all over the place due to things like gaming right through to other factors like shift work or even partying lol.

It actually sounds like they are getting a decent amount of sleep. I mean I would kill to be able to get 6-8 hours. The only thing that may sound a bit off or make you suspect insomnia is the odd times they are sleeping at and the all nighter to ""reset"" which again sort of makes me think they may just have a sleep pattern thats out of whack and therefore their bodyclock is out of synch and the all nighter maybe helps get it back to something a little more normal.

I guess it would all come down to if they are getting enough sleep so as not to be unduly tired and if they are able to drift off easy enough and stay asleep for the durations you mention. Hope this helps a little anyway :)"

It's great you have a good job though as that can only really work in your favour even though there are no guarantees. At least sometimes if you are feeling a bit down with regards to your bad luck and lack of success (so far....hopefully it's not permanent) in dating, you can hopefully take pride in your achievement with regards to gaining employment and financially rewarding employment at that, so well done :)

schizophrenia,fgee1hv,t3_exzfjd,1580697405.0,"Hey man I'm really sorry that you are feeling this way and going through this. I guess im lucky in that I only hear things. Up to now they have been relatively harmless in that there havent been any negative instructions or anything, just hearing things either one voice or lots all talking at the same time so I can't get a handle on what they are saying. So nothing persecutory or anything thankfully and I'm only mentioning this to try and let you know that you arent alone in at least hearing things that are not there.

Also, please don't think I'm getting all high and mighty on you or trying to tell you what to do it's just there is a lot of Woke people out there in this period of time we live in and a lot of virtue signallers and social justice warriors.....snowflakes basically.

These people have a very bad habit of not only wanting to ""take people down"", so to speak, but also keep them down.....forever!!! They have no concept of the fact that sometimes people make a mistake and that once they have apologised and atoned for this mistake, should be forgiven. No....they believe that such a person should be cast out from society, their friends, their job etc and never have a social circle or work ever again. I might add that they usually try and enforce such ludicrous punishments from the comfort (or more like safety) of their computer and home, so that they do not have to face the person who's life they believe they have the right to ruin forever.

What I'm trying to say is that in light of the people I mention and current climate that we live in one kind of has to be careful about what one says. You are clearly having such delusions due to your condition and you are aware of this yourself but quite often, Generation Snowflake is either unaware that these things can happen or they are so caught up in their campaign to right all the perceived wrongs in the world (they often even go out of their way to look for them!)...that they just don't care.

I would just be careful about who you tell about the delusions that you are having and perhaps only discuss them with medical professionals or people that you trust implicitly as they could be construed as being Anti Semetic. Obviously you are only describing your delusions but these people don't care that you are suffering from a mental illness and my fear is that they would come after you.

Ironically despite you having these delusions as a result of a mental illness and them basically not giving a damn about that as long as you have given them something to grab a hold of and run with (i.e. Anti Semetism). They would be the first to shout from the rooftops that their mental health is being damaged if someone had the audacity to tell them to get a life and/or inform them that they should perhaps try and take up a hobby as they clearly have far too much time on their hands!

It's not even anyones fault it's just life and the way most people are wired but you are definitely correct in what you are saying as some people, such as yourself, are the exception and can actually see someone and be attracted to them for the person they are, not what they can bring to the table.

It's also great to cross paths with people like yourself as in all honesty it can promote hope. As if there were not folks like yourself who are the exception, then guys like me would be absolutely up shit creek lol."
dating,fge7v22,t1_fge47qd,1580693355.0,"Hey, really cool of you to offer advice from a girls point of view, thanks for that :) .What I havent seen mentioned in any of the posts (sorry I only scanned the thread) are the two biggest factors that are almost fool proof in terms of attracting women.

The first one is, of course, money. Nobody likes to admit it and quite often girls don't like to even talk about it let alone admit it, which is understandable as they don't want to be seen as shallow and/or goldiggers, but no sane person has ever disputed that money can turn a 5 into a 9.5.

The other is having a status in society. It may be fame (thats why actors, musicians, television personalities etc) have no problem at all attracting women. Status can also be as a result of having power in some form. This can be being an owner of a successful business (they will have the added bonus of having attribute number 1 above too). Or it can be someone who is say a gangster and their power is derived from that status.

Either way, if someone has money and/or a status in society the simple fact is they will never struggle with women."

I would even rather spend time with Irish people than Scottish people (nothing against fellow Scots) and I seem to get on far better with Irish girls than Scottish girls for some reason so I love the fact that the Scots and Irish seem to have a good relationship.

It's a shame as when people are just honest about things, no matter if it's to do with dating, friendship, wanting to borrow money, why they haven't been in touch etc it just makes life soooo much easier. Life is complicated enough but for some unknown reason there are people who like to make it even more complicated by lying or being disingenuous.

Not criticising you at all as we all fall into the same trap and both girls and guys are guilty of it but just reading things like ""play it cool"" , ""would act more..."" etc just makes me wonder..... what ever happened to honesty lol?

Life would be so much easier if everyone wasn't so disingenous and was just honest with each other. I remember clearly a particular situation with a girl I used to see. It was a saturday night and I asked if she wanted to do something i.e. cinema, something to eat, go for a few drinks etc whatever she wanted to do. Or if she was happy to sit in with a few drinks. She said she was happy to sit in.

Anyway an hour or two passed and you could see by her face she wasn't happy so I'm like ""OK....somethings wrong that you aren't telling me.....what is it this time?"" and she started going on about how she didnt want to sit in and was bored????

So I said ""But I asked what you wanted to do and would have done whatever you wanted to do but you said you wanted to sit in...so that is what we have done?"" You know what she said???? She said (im paraphrasing as I forget what she said word for word but it was something like) ""But when I say I want to sit in.....that really means that I  don't want to sit in...it really means that I want to go out and do something!!""

I mean.....what chance do you have? How is one person supposed to know that the other person is lying? Or at least doesnt mean what they say? The only way I could have known was if I was psychic or telepathic which I am not. I just think things would be soooo much easier and people would get along much better if everyone was just honest with each other."
BorderlinePDisorder,fg7v9g0,t3_exeyn6,1580602326.0,"Hi there I know that you don't need anyone to tell you that what you describe is classic BPD. I also will no need to remind you that certain things, especially in realtion to this condition, are easier said than done!

However if you feel that he is slipping away my advice is two fold:

1) Ask yourself why you feel he is slipping away. Baring in mind there are relationships ending in the world every hour of everyday, probably even more frequently than that and most of these people don't have BPD. Some relationships, most even when you think about it, just don't make it and it is usually nothing to do with BPD. However if after asking yourself why you feel this is happening, the answer comes  to you and you feel that the solution to this problem is within your realms of capabilities??? Then you should use these capabilities to stop the relationship ebbing away (if you can). Like I said sometimes easier said than done but if you want it to work you need to at least look for a possible solution and then implement this solution.

2) Secondly if for some unfortunate reason(s) the relationship is not able to be salvaged then you should not fear being alone. Sure sometimes it sucks but it is something that the vast majority of people experience at some point. It can also be an ideal opportunity for some ""me time"" and also a chance for a time of relection. Reflection on what it was that caused that relationship and that chapter in your life to come to an end (although sometimes it is as simple as things were not meant to be). 

This period of reflection can often offer up answers and reasons as to why things did not pan out and the combination of reflection and ""me time"" coupled with the answers that come to light as a result can often provide a new avenue for you to explore in future relationships or even just simply be something that has been a life experience that allows you to call upon these experiences in future relationships and become a sort of reference point if things take a similar turn....at least you will then know how to react or what action to take to potentially save future courtships. 

Remember the saying ""When one door closes, another opens"". Sometimes when something that we deem to be negative happens. In the future when we look back on it, it can sometimes have transpired that it was actually the best thing that could have occurred, even though we obviously do not think it at the time. The catalyst for an even better future set of events!

All the best to you no matter what turns life takes :)"
BorderlinePDisorder,fg7th86,t3_exena6,1580601057.0,"Everything you mention are common traits of someone with BPD. If it helps, the emptiness and identity crisis type problems, i.e. not really knowing who or what I am are things that are particular issues with me.

I try and take solace from realising that although it's not caused by the same things and also that they probably aren't even aware of it let alone analyse or think about it....that most people are sort of like sheep in a way. I love the term ""Sheeple"" (instead of people). A lot of people without BPD (from my observations and experience anyway) just go with the crowd and follow and copy everyone else in a sheep/lemming type way.

It's almost like one of their main avenues in terms of getting through life is ""Everyone else is doing it...so I should do it too!"". It's actually quite fascinating the lengths that some people go to in order to fit in or be part of the in crowd. It can be a factor in everything from clothes, friends, partners, hobbies, what they eat and drink, their pets right through to getting married and even sometimes having children.......because everyone else is doing it so let me do it.

childfree,fg7pgtj,t1_fg7lnix,1580598193.0,"It definitely is strange, for sure. I guess we have to remember that sometimes people have problems and issues that we aren't aware of or do not understand even if we are aware of them. These issues and problems I guess can sometimes cause people to turn to alcohol, drugs, acting out etc in an attempt to deal with these issues.

Ultimately some people have more problems than others and as a result make mistakes in attempting to deal with these problems as when they realise their mistake and take steps to remedy them I do believe the deserve credit.

However as we alluded to, the people who have basically been good citizens and have flew under the radar in a sense, because they have not caused havoc, but who quietly have been working hard for years to learn, to obtain qualifications and who in essence have been just plugging away to try and make a better life for themselves (like yourself) or even make a better life for themselves AND contribute to society, like your friend in med school, get no credit whatsoever. It really makes very little sense.

I guess at least you and your friend now know that there are some people out there (e.g. myself and im sure a lot of others) who do appreciate you guys.

BorderlinePDisorder,fg7oewa,t3_ex2e1v,1580597451.0,"Hey there, Im really sorry you are going through this and experiencing these emotions and incidents. I'd also like to confirm that I am no expert and have no medical or psychological training whatsoever and so basically I don't really know what I'm talking about.

However having said that, I found somethings through trial and error that have worked for me, to an extent anyway and may perhaps work for you. If not then feel free to just disregard them and what im about to say.

What I have found helpful is to ditch the BPD related jargon and constipated thinking. Obviously we have this condition and as a result we look into it. The symptoms, manifestations, coping mechanisms etc, pretty natural thing to do.

However I found that always looking at ""Am I splitting?""....""Who am I splitting with?"".....""Why am I splitting?"" etc or ""Do I have an FP?"".......""Who is my FP?""......""Am I pushing my FP away?"". This can all lead to getting completely bogged down with the condition and often becoming obsessed with it and obsessed with one's self too.

There isnt anything we can to do change the fact that we have BPD but I've found trying to think and operate more like a normal person can sometimes actually help our situation. Even things as simple as not referring to people or scenarios using typical BPD labels and cliche's can help us to function a little more like normal people.

Instead of getting bogged down with labels and cliches which I believe can subconciously drag us deeper into the negative aspects of the condition, if we look at certain situations not as say ""Splitting"" or ""Oh no my FP is going to abandon me"" if we look at these scenarios more like ""Im feeling a bit vulnerable and fragile here....but what would a normal person do??? Not what would another BPD sufferer do but what would a normal person do? No labels, no cliche's no BPD terminology etc and sometimes it can help us.

For example it can make use realise we are over thinking something. It can make us realise that we are creating a mountain out of a molehill. It can even offer us insight into a ""normal person's"" chain of thought and allow us to act more rationally or even realise that we are creating something out of nothing.

Again please don't think I'm trying to tell you what to do, I'm not. I'm just offering a different view point and if it doesn't work for you or help then just disregard it and back to the drawing board. I just don't think all the lables and terminology do much good and often cause us to over analyse things.

childfree,fg7mpys,t3_exciph,1580596267.0,"Motherhood, fatherhood, procreation in general.

Despite it being an act that people have been perpetrating for thousands of years (at least) often without really thinking it through and often just because ""everyone else was doing it!"" It really irks me that mothers and fathers somehow think that THEIR produce is somehow ""special"".

Heaven forbid someone has the audacity to criticise THEIR little cherubs. It gets worse as their offspring get older too. I've witnessed many occasions where, for example a youngster has smashed a window, stole something from a shop, bullied another child etc and when the parents are informed their reaction has been ""No!!!!....Not MY kids!!!!!"" You feel like saying....""I fucking SAW them do it!!!!! Are you calling me a liar? Or saying I experienced a hallucination???

You say they would never do such a thing?......yet you were not even around to be able to confirm if they were or were not guilty of said acts!!!!""

To offer a contributation to your initial question though.....it really is a strange one. I've always sort of compared it to drug addiction....now bare with me here and these are obviously generalisations but I believe them to be accurate for the most part.

Take for example someone who develops a heroin addiction and robs and steals to support this habit. They are often labelled a scumbag. However if this same ""scumbag"" then get themselves clean via rehab, methadone, subbies etc then they...the very same person who was vilified... are now given an immense amount of credit. Now I'm not saying that they do not deserve credit for realising their mistake (we all make mistakes) and taking action to remedy said mistakes. But my main point of interest has always been.....what about the people who DID NOT develop drug addiction? The folks who did not then have to clean up? The folks who did not make all these mistakes and lived a better life?

These people get no credit whatsoever?????? It's similar to people just popping out babies left right and centre and often....they don't even look after them, it's grandparents or nannies or other childcare yet they get all the credit under the sun for completing what is a relatively mundane task that other equally as ordinary people have been doing for tens of thousands of years.

Anyway, trying to get the old one out which had been in there for over 20 years and constantly expanding and contracting was a total bitch and the tool that is used to remove and fit elements kept slipping off and hitting other pipes etc.

The emptiness feeling or being alone/isolated are some of the strangest things I find. Almost like everyone else knows and is aware of who and what they are whereas we just feel like a sort of empty vessel at times. Existing but having no true feelings of self or direction or purpose. It's definitely not easy but well done on trying to get through it and being positive it definitely helps :)"

childfree,fg7aw89,t1_fg6frjx,1580588099.0,"Good post. I've come into contact over the years with some girls who couldn't be on birth control pills as they had side effects. To be honest I don't know if a girl experiences side effects with one type of contraceptive pill, if that means that she would have side effects with all of them, or the coil, or the implant but realise that sometimes it's harder to get on these if they can't even get on the pill or at least without a lot of difficulty in the first place.

Some of them said that they were unable to use condoms because of superstitious (or Religious or whatever you want to call it) reasons. However this often confused me as if the superstition/Religion that they follow prohibits the use of condoms then it usually also prohibits sex before marriage etc.

I always felt that if they were already ""breaking"" one aspect of a doctrine then they may as well break another by using a rubber. In for a penny in for a pound so to speak?

Anyway, really glad that the OP has found a way to enjoy sex (regardless of whatever Dogma casts it's shadow) without having to worry about ruining her life in the process. As has been mentioned making these things to difficult to get on rarely does any good, only harm :("

BorderlinePDisorder,fg773f1,t3_exa4x0,1580585533.0,"Hey there, a lot of people with BPD actually diagnose themselves. Im not saying this is a good or bad thing it's just GP's (I'm assuming from your username you are in the UK) are exactly that, General Practitioners, they aren't experts in anything. Therefore they can often miss BPD. Couple that with the time constraints they are under and the fact that BPD has a reputation for being difficult to officially diagnose and often wrongly diagnosed as other conditions and the result is that people can go years before being officially diagnosed until they are perhaps referred to a Psychiatrist.

Im obviously no expert but if you do have it, my advice (from personal experience) is, try not to  immerse yourself and become totally obsessed with the condition. It's easier said than done! 

Im also not saying that you should not try and find out different ways to help day to day living or make your life better or to try and better understand the condition. However to live every minute of your life thinking about ""Am I splitting?"" and going on about ""My FP this and my FP that"" and just allowing BPD to take over your every waking hour is usually not productive and often results in one becoming self obsessed and self absorbed which in turn creates a spiral of negativity and overthinking. 

Now, the traits mentioned above can often be part and parcel of the condition but to actually wallow constantly in these things and allow them to consume you, usually just makes things worse and can cause a domino effect in terms of negativity and molehill thinking.

Like I said it's easier said than done and I'm only advising againsy such actions because I've been extremely guilty of them myself and it has never helped. What has helped is when finding yourself doing these things if you use certain aspects of CBT/DBT and ask if you are overthinking things? If you are creating a mountain out of a molehill? Would normal people being indulging in this chain of thought etc? I've found this can help and also reduce anxiety too.

Good luck anyway and I wish you all the best."

BorderlinePDisorder,ffw1v56,t3_evj1gt,1580280783.0,"I have a few but I just feel empty a lot of the time and I struggle to understand how they are feeling or how to react even if they tell me what they are feeling as often I don't even know how I am feeling. Therefore it's difficult for me to know when to act like I'm supposed to act, like how a normal person would act naturally without thinking about it? I've often been described as being ""cold"" I really don't mean it and when I've had relationships ive tried to show them that I care, that I love them but it just doesnt seem to manifest itself that way :(

However ultimately I've always felt that at some point they would get fed up with me and my lack of ability to express or even feel emotions and ultimately leave me. I guess that is the fear of abandonment thing. It's perhaps due to being cast asside in the past for the BBD (Bigger Better Deal). In my experience most people are just out to get what they can in life and that often means dumping a boyfriend for a new guy that is more exciting, has more money, a better car, more friends, that their own friends would be more approving of or even envious of the girl for dating (wow you are dating him, you're so lucky) etc. I've just found most people to be really shallow.

It got so bad that now I dont really bother with relationships as I seem to have come to the unfortunate chain of thought that rather than be in a relationship and be worried about them leaving me. Now I sort of view life as no relationship = no possibility of abandonment so i've been alone for a long time now and can't really see that changing anytime soon.

Of course what really happens when you avoid relationships is that you are depriving yourself of something potentially good in order to save yourself from something potentially bad.

There are the other symptoms of BPD too of course but the emptyness as to not knowing who or what I am and how Im supposed to act really negatively effected past relationships. I just feel I don't really have much to offer so largely keep to myself."

childfree,ffvybgb,t1_ffvxig5,1580277085.0,"Yeah can't disagree with any of that to be honest. I'm possibly being negative here but when I have met people roughly my age and even that i've been friends with who were clearly struggling, or perhaps not struggling so much, but just realising that their life is so much more difficult and complicated with kids i.e. cant really do anything spontaneous, everything has to be planned around the children and childcare as well as the sheer expense of it all and extra responsibilty etc for example being responsible for another human being, pretty much 24/7 for the next 18 years (at least).

I often felt that they encourage and want others to have kids so that they are in the same predicament as themselves. Sort of like it makes them feel better that others have made the same mistakes? I hate to use that word ""mistakes"" as they usually adore their kids. But just sort of taking comfort that others are now in the same situation as they are and that they know others too have now found themselves in the situation where their lives have changed forever and not necessarily in a good way.

But they all say that if they had their time over again then they would not have had them. I admire their honesty and the honesty of the mothers that the OP mentions. Carrying and giving birth to a child/children takes its toll on the body of a woman too. 

I mean I used to see a girl when we were young so was lucky enough to share her time and also when being intimate her body. We broke up but there was no bad feeling. We then hooked up again years later only by this time she had given birth to a child. Her body was completely different and although she was still a thoroughly lovely person and being a little older I was more in it for her absolutely amazing personality and she was a joy to be around, there were marked differences in certain areas (i.e. areas of her body).

 I felt really bad for her as these changes really bothered her as she yearned for her old body (i.e. pre child birth). I guess it's true that when you bring a child into the world things will never be the same again."

I'm also not sure who you were responding to or if it was just a general contribution to the thread. Either way I don't think any of us wish suffering upon anyone (children or adults) or at least I don't.

Some of us do feel really bad for people who die that did not suffer from depression. I'm probably not the only one who feels that life is unfair and if there really was a God it would be great if there would be some kind of swap deal that could be negotiated?

For example it breaks my heart when you open a newspaper and read an article about a child who had died but who had a zest for life and their whole life ahead of them. Who knows what they could have achieved or the great times they could have had providing depression didnt strike?

Like the kids you mention some of us (impossible as it is) if we could somehow swap places, would do so. Then in a strange way it would actually be worth having being born if our only achievment or positive imprint in life was to give life to someone who wants to live and can/will embrace it."
