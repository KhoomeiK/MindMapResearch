Before the ring, Sméagol was a good person with a best friend. He had a great home. And everything he could have wished for. Through no fault of his own he stumbled onto the ring and his life was changed forever. He never had a chance.

During the movie and a lot of the book Sméagol strikes me as similar to a recovering alcoholic that is trying so hard. And for a while we see the good person underneath the disease. He finds some purpose and joy in helping others and being part of something. For the first time in ages he is living his life again. It is rocky but god damnit he is alive. But as you know the addiction overtakes him again in the form of Gollum.

Sméagol’s/Gollum’s ending makes me so sad. Because sometimes even the best people are trapped and ruined by addiction. Sméagol died in agony along with Gollum. And the only happiness Smeagol had was his release from the addiction in his death."

dating,fjtkn3b,t1_fjti1wj,1583608646.0,"That’s always been my problem. I am countering it now with several strategies.

First, I avoid sugary things and things with lots of carbs. So if I go to the local burger drive through I get lots of beef on the burger and skip the fries. So I don’t completely avoid carbs, but I recognize that they fuck up blood sugar and don’t offer any real nutritional benefit. Basically I follow the primal diet a lot but I have carbs whenever I damn well please.

Second, I eat when I am hungry. No exceptions. Calorie count be dammed. I don’t eat when I am not hungry. So what I am saying here is that I have learned to focus my mind and find the difference between eating for pleasure and eating to fuel my body. Pleasure eating or emotional eating, for me, was a way to confirm self anger and hatred. Like, I felt I didn’t deserve to be a healthy good looking guy and so I ate to ensure that my punishment was carried out.

Third, I gave up my addiction to diet soda. It is shitty for me and it fucks with my body. Now I drink tea or carbonated water if I need a treat.

Fourth, alcohol not more than once a week or two. It’s  impossible for me to get healthy when I am drinking on the daily. Alcohol was another way to hurt myself.

I was tired of mourning my youth.

One morning while shaving, two months later, I noticed my arms were looking good.

A couple of months later, a woman gave me her phone number without me asking for it! Women were suddenly striking up conversations with me. Complimenting my shoes and clothes (which I have taken the time to upgrade significantly). My confidence skyrocketed and I realized that the act of joyful conversation with people was addicting. I struck up conversation with men and women whenever I could. Knowing that my body is strong makes me so happy - my happiness and positive energy makes me attractive.

I cannot overemphasize the advantage of being in shape. By working out you are showing love to yourself. If you love yourself then you become more attractive to others. It sends a message to men and women: “I am self aware and mature enough to take care of my body.” You don’t have to be crazy muscular to achieve this effect.

PurplePillDebate,fg4bjm7,t1_fg4bbpi,1580500253.0,The top of this thread asked for a legal opinion and I gave one..............
PurplePillDebate,fg4amey,t1_fg49g8y,1580499693.0,"This is my last reply. After this, we will have to agree to disagree.

If you are correct, then you will not have difficulty finding case law that supports your opinion. But you won’t be able to find it because you are wrong. Given that you are the one asserting that the behavior is illegal, it is your burden to prove it. You haven’t met that burden. 

Magazines and television companies express viewpoints all the time. They have a right to control who expresses the viewpoint and it’s content. The government can’t restrict that right because doing so would violate the First Amendment.

The First Amendment only binds the government. Not private entities. I could host a podcast and only allow men on it. We could talk about how men’s issues to our hearts’ content. And there’s nothing the government could do about it. And the Courts are also the government. 

The server host could take down my content because they don’t like it. And there’s nothing I could do about it because nobody has to agree with me or provide me with a platform.

You can disagree and argue all you want. You can say it’s unfair, and maybe it is and maybe it isn’t, but that won’t make it actionable under the law. Again, find an actual case that supports your argument. Or heck, even a well written law review article. If you’re right, that should be as easy as googling it."
PurplePillDebate,fg48rp8,t1_fg48bfi,1580498558.0,"It’s not though. MGTOW expresses a viewpoint. And Reddit doesn’t have to allow that viewpoint. Any law that attempted to force them to use their capital to help express a specific viewpoint would violate the first amendment. You aren’t going to find a case that supports your argument because you are wrong on the law.

And given the number of users, there would definitely be a lawsuit if Reddit was violating the civil rights of hundreds of thousands of people."
PurplePillDebate,fg47zzy,t1_fg47wvf,1580498085.0,"Okay, well if you’re right then I am sure Reddit will be sued into the ground."
PurplePillDebate,fg47hi6,t1_fg448yi,1580497768.0,"Okay, well I disagree. I am not going to analyze your new hypotheticals.

I am an attorney with experience handling civil rights cases. That is the basis for my opinion. Please cite a statute or law that you think Reddit is violating."
PurplePillDebate,fg43r23,t1_fg436lz,1580495534.0,"There are laws that prohibit gender discrimination in the work place. Gender discrimination in the workplace is not protected by the First Amendment.

There are no laws prohibiting the exercise of free speech by a private company such as Reddit. Reddit can ban anything they want for any reason or no reason."
PurplePillDebate,fg415ba,t1_fg3o07m,1580493976.0,It’s not. People and corporations have a right to free speech. That means that they don’t have to offer up their platform to others of differing viewpoints. Nor do they have to explain their reasoning.

bigdickproblems,ffwj5wq,t1_ffwiqjc,1580302738.0,"She could have said it more tactfully, but if she needs a big dick to get excited, then it is true for her. I do get your point, but everyone has their thing. It doesn’t make anyone shallow or wrong to really want their thing."
bigdickproblems,ffwiwja,t3_evk2g3,1580302511.0,I recommend using a kink site to meet men. You can be up front about what you are looking for and you’re a lot more likely to find it.

bigdickproblems,ffwij5c,t1_ffw9pa7,1580302170.0,She’s into what she’s into. Nothing wrong with that.
