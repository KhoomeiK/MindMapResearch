But I can imagine how unpleasant it must be to be so totally consumed by it. And for me my main character is something very similar. I talk to him, cuddle with him at night, go for walks with him, endless scenarios where we meet in real life, or even when being with friends I imagine he is with me. And I hear him say: come on let's go home and sometimes I just do exactly that because sometimes I enjoy spending time dreaming more than being with my friends. Or sometimes I just fail to concentrate on what my friends are talking about because of these dreams. ..

I found the frequency of day dreaming to be strongly correlated to feeling lonely. So you create yourself a fantasy friend or partner to cope with it. Drugs can make you numb for feeling lonely so maybe that's why you don't daydream so much. I stopped drugs but for me those things actually increase my daydreams. 

Anyway if you want advice I would say you should connect more to other people to feel less lonely. Or/and talk to your mum and tell her you want some professional help."

I don't believe he will change. He sounds like he knows what things to say to make you trust him (""should I block her?"") but actions are what counts. 

I would go cold on him completely till therapy. I advice you to just think about yourself and ask yourself: will I really be able to trust him after that? Do I really want to be with someone I cannot trust? Do not think about why he did that. This is not your job. It is also not your job to educate him on how to behave. He is an adult. 

YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS! it is your job to take care of yourself now and to protect yourself from guys like that. If they know they can get away with such bullshit then they will foul you again and again. I had to learn the hard way too. 

I know breaking up does not seem like an option to you because you are scared like hell. But seriously think of it in the long term: do you really wanna be scared for the rest of your life he could do something like that again? You will not die by breaking up.

Doesn't sound one bit like that. He is clearly not respecting your boundaries and is not doing everything for you. Time to take off the pink glasses and stopp the wishful thinking.

You repeatedly communicated your boundary and he keeps on ignoring it. He knows he will get away with it so why should he change? Why should he give up that ego boost? Ah well my finance feels uncomfortable but well she will complain and that's about it. 

Talking won't bring you anywhere! You do feel uncomfortable  (as would I btw) and that is a valid feeling! Do excuse this feeling or let him manipulate / gaslight you into thinking you are overreacting! 

You need to go cold on him. Or better get rid off him completely. Someone following strippers won't change. And if he is already doing this I would doubt he is loyal to you in other respects too. 

In summary: he is NOT respecting you and you have done ENOUGH communication with this ego pig. WAKE UP!"
relationship_advice,fpi582d,t3_gdfo1s,1588633904.0,"Google gives you plenty of signs.

The biggest problem I see is that people simply fail to see they are not compatible. But they are so blinded by love (and later trauma bond) that they prefer to stay in unhealthy always fighting relationship. Always hoping the other one would change. 

In my opinion it is always the fault of both. Not both my be equally abusive but if you fail to see the red flags and protect yourself then there is an important lesson for you to learn.

Of course it is easy to just blame your ex and say ex was so terrible... but if you do just that changes are that the same things just gonna happen in your next relationship again. Thus I vote for some self reflection when ever someone tells me about a toxic relationship."

A friend tried to argue me into a relationship ala but we would fit perfectly together because of abc and d. To this day I disagree.

The important point is that you see you need to distance yourself and not give him that power to make you still jealous. It is natural and a few weeks are nothing. That fact that you are still hurting shows that you are capable of having deep feelings.

relationship_advice,fkvzx8y,t3_fl11dr,1584580337.0,Not acceptable. Do yourself a favor and leave. A person who cares obviously so less about you wont change after you show her the replies you got here. You deserve way better! And she deserves her ex which just seems as disrespectful as her.
relationship_advice,fkogzf4,t3_fjaysk,1584387028.0,"I think you felt unheard for a long time and  have tried already multiple times to communicate with her with no result. Note sure if showing her that note will help if you already tried to tell her in person. 

Sounds like she is overwhelmed and tried of speaking about relationship problems. Don't get me wrong I do agree that is important to speak about these things. But I also know what it is like to be with someone who is not willing to talk about problems. You cannot force them to. 

Like you, I have a low self esteem. This leads us to chase our partners. If we do that they will run away even more. 

It is not okay of your wife to refuse to communicate and treat you like that. And the only way you will be able to stop that is by not letting her treat you like this.

She is being distant? Start to get distant to. Tell her you love her and want to fix things and if she wants the same (give her time for this decision) then she should let you know. But don't chase her by trying every evening to hold up a conversation about your day if she doesn't want to/ shows you the cold shoulder. I'm saying it again: don't let yourself be treated like that! This will not make you happy nor change anything."
AmItheAsshole,fklth05,t3_fj0o8v,1584314229.0,"I also really disliked how my sister behaved in relationships sometimes. But still she is my sister so I would never publicly take the side of her ex. I would listen to her side of the story and tell her straight up what I don't like about her behaviour. Just as I would expect it from her. Often when people suffer from mental health problems the get lost in theIr problems and aren't able to see anymore how they affect others. That is why it is very important to make them aware.

And her ex really doesn't seems to be an angel at all. Holy shit how can people put such videos online?! I will never get social media. 

And yes I really hope you are not secretly into him. Just even thinking you need to bring that up made me suspicious. No then you would really be the A."
BPDsupport,fkircc9,t3_fip4o6,1584226797.0,"Yes you do need to leave him. I was in a similar situation. Is there anywhere you can go to for a few weeks? I find it better to be away after a breakup and have people around me I can talk to and who care. 

You will only get worse when staying with him. And he won't change. Why should he? Hey knows exactly how addicted you are. It will hurt a lot but you will survive it and come clean of him! And I promise you will be so proud of yourself for standing up and protecting yourself."
relationship_advice,fkck3r2,t3_fhckqh,1584054778.0,"To me it is understandable how you feel. 
Ask yourself: realistically what would you need to get over it? Would more reassurance really help? Will you really be able to get over it? Is he really worth living with that nagging feeling?

In some sense he broke your trust and also after the initial bad treatment you couldn't build up real trust from the start. So it is much more than just that girl. Because I imagine you fear he might turn into a ""bad boyfriend"" again one day. 

This is why we shouldn't except such treatment from the start. But of course you cannot go back in time. I think you need decide for yourself if you will ever be able to get over it. And that the answer to how to get over it is somewhere in yourself if that makes sense."

BPD,fk5capv,t3_fgcg1n,1583877620.0,"For me this fear definitely comes from childhood and how my mum would treat me when she was angry. So whenever now someone get angry or annoyed with me - or I just believe that - I become this small child again that thinks something life threatening might happen again (which actually did). So I guess I ""just"" need to tell myself I am not a child anymore and grow up?"

BPD,fk1rjdn,t3_ffysho,1583785425.0,"It is difficult. And I am sorry to hear your fear turned out to be true. First thing to do is to calm down. Have a list prepared of things that work for you. For me it is hiding in bed and shout into my pillow, talking to friends if that is possible. After that maybe a shower, some intense exercises. When no longer in ""emotional mind"" focus on the facts and figure out how you could find out if your fears are actually true without causing damage. No damage to your self worth or any relationship. This must be your goal: that you want to feel good about yourself and have healthy relationships. If you conclude the person you are splitting on is not health get ready to let them go or to kick them out of your life. But again only do this if you have the facts sorted. Friends or family or even people on reddit can help you finding out and give you a different perspective if needed."

BPD,fjy1g4z,t3_ffdck1,1583687911.0,You could ask your psychiatrist for a mood stabiliser. This might help for the mood swings to become not so strong and less frequent. Origami sounds like a good idea. I don't think it is stupid at all.I guess what helps me a lot is when I can talk to a friend and feel understood. But of course that is also not always an option.
BPD,fjvabk5,t3_ff1r7h,1583624774.0,Not had that but some other ADs triggered hypermania in me. You should be honest with your doc about this.

I cannot believe you let yourself be treated like that. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS GOING NOWHERE BUT WILL DRAG YOU MORE DOWN WITH EVERY DAY! I don't even want to comment on him.

askwomenadvice,fjp0zpn,t3_femkgn,1583539210.0,"I was like that too. You know you have avery unhealthy dynamic going on and yes you should NOT chase him if he misbehaved. Why you are doing that? Probably linked to your childhood and insecure attachment style, fear of being abandoned. But believe me: you are far better off alone than with someone who doesn't care and makes you feel shit about yourself. Deal with your emotions first and only when you have a clear mind again talk to him again. He will only use your despare against you."
SkincareAddiction,fjnu5ez,t3_fedptn,1583514479.0,Honestly I don't see a real difference
askwomenadvice,fjniqb7,t3_feeq0j,1583508264.0,"I did it once because hey life is short, you never know, and I needed to confront my dreams with reality. 
Reaching out and telling someone you thought about them is not a bad thing. Ask them how they are doing and if they are interested to get in contact more they will let you know. But be prepared that chances are you will get disappointed. It will suck for a while but at least then you can free yourself from your fantasy."
