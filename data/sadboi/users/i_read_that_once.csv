SuicideWatch,f6vptf7,t3_dkfkaq,1573194887.0,"I became obsessed with death at an early age. Possibly with the death of my great grandmother at 6 years old. From that moment on I felt fated to die at an early age. I felt certain that I would be one of those tragic childhood deaths. I was so certain of it that I never thought too much about the future. When I was 9 I began questioning if this end might be by my own doing. I wanted to die but I was too scared of the pain or the possibility of damnation. I begged god to show me a sign or simply take my life for me. I knew that I would never make it to high school one way or another. Then I just knew I would never make it out of high school. Then I felt sure my time would come in college. Now, in my late 20s, I am no longer sure of my expiration date. There have been many nights of agonizing pain and prayer that I might be taken now or to at least give me the strength to do it myself. When the mental anguish becomes so intense that you feel visceral excruciating pain. Then I go into a calm silent depression which takes the time to illustrate every detail of how I would do it. I lay there for hours motionless in a calming eerie trance. That is what brings me back from that edge, but it is not exactly healthy either. My therapist says that most people above a certain IQ have a morbid curiosity  and that many people who frequently contemplate suicide are above average intelligence.  My dog is the main reason I've been able to pull through. I dont trust anybody to keep up with his healthcare and wellbeing the way I do. I'm finally dating the love of my life. I know that he would care for him to the extent of my standards. Now the thing that holds me back is the sorrow I would inflict upon him. He is the only one I ever felt would truly mourn me. No matter how much I try, I just can't seem to get my life together. The compiled disappointments and personal failures just always seem to be too much. Outside of my boyfriend, I have no real friends. Ots not for lack of effort. I was jad great friend da. One group ghosted me a year ago. I still dont know why. My other friends are really just my boyfriend's friends who probably wouldn't hang with me if it weren't for him. Nobody at my work likes me. I have tried so hard to make friends there. My bosses want to fire me because of how mean they are to me but they like them better. They say I'm a hard worker and they really wish it would work out but I have to learn how to suck it up or move on. My last couple jobs have actually ended similarly.  I think there is something broken in my personality which nobody can quite put their finger on but they dont like me. Some people say I'm real funny. I'm like cool. Lests be friends. But they always seem to be the type of people that dont hang out outside of work or they too busy being parents to have friends without kids. Even my old friends that had kids haven't done shit eith me in years because they only talk to other people with kids now. For real... I dont like to open up about my depression with most people though. I feel like there are so few peo ppl willing to befriend me, why fuck it up by being a debby downer."
SuicideWatch,f6vnht5,t1_f6vmpbb,1573192155.0,"We had that one beautiful moment. It helped me to understand that people who have not been effected by depression may not understand it.I still dont feel like he understands the depth  of it or how it never fully goes away. There are times when hope seems  a possibility.  

My father is no longer as insensitive with his remarks now. Which is good because without knowing his lack of understanding felt utterly cruel."
SuicideWatch,f6vmpbb,t1_f4ho3fp,1573191283.0,"So much truth in the false narratives. I think about all the people who say how much damage is inflicted on those you leave behind and how their family blamed themselves. Lol. Clearly we have different families.  My family is too narcissistic to blame themselves for anything, rewrites factual events to their own warped memories, and completely ignores when you try ediscussing poor mental health.

My father used to make fun of me for seeing a therapist. Mid family discussion he would say ""suppose that's something else you gotta talk to your therapist about."" In a super condescending tone. Or how he tried to barge into my therapy session when I invited my mom to talk about our fight that had the two of us not speaking for about 6 months. My therapist had to be likw...  excuse me sire...  you are welcome to sit in the waiting room. I'm a grown ass woman! I am 28 years old. Nobody invited my dad. He just freaking showed up! He and his friend's advice for my depression were ""get happy."" 

Thankfully a few months ago my father asked me out to dinner (VERRY UNUSUAL/NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE/WTF IS GOING ON?!). For tbe first time he asked what it was like. He explained to me that he actually did not understand depression.  He knew what it was like to be sad but making the conscious decision to be happy is apparently possible.

I never knew that people really didn't even know what depression was like and how it differed from sadness."

Mange can't be diagnosed by a picture on the internet. It can be diagnosed under a microscope by a veterinarian."

Case does not appear emergent and should be fine until surgeon can look at it tomorrow. Continue to restrict activity. Make sure they are not licking/chewing at incision site.

If there is slight inflammation,  you can gently apply ice pack for a few minutes just to get them through the night until tomorrow's recheck."
Veterinary,f22lvo8,t3_dbk0nq,1569891717.0,"The pet usually has to be abandoned for a certain length of time. When you can, call your local animal control to find out local laws on abandonment.  Usually we have an owner sign an owner release paper before treating patient. Obviously this was not an option in this case.  Maybe him running will constitute abandonment in your area. In which case he has no more claim to the pet. You can treat then adopt out. Otherwise tell him he is welcome to pick up the cat on thursday upon payment of the bill and give him his total that will be due on that day (initial exam, treatment, meds, daily hospitalization/boarding costs, etc.) Tell him that the daily hospitalization/boarding charges will continue daily until he is able to pick up&pay. Then alert him that by _____day if he has not paid bill in full and picked up the pet, the pet is officially considered abandoned by your laws and he is no longer the owner."
AskVet,f22kr7w,t3_dba9rc,1569891114.0,"Agree with many other posts.
Log the activity, date, and duration of episode.
Consult a veterinarian. 
If it was a seizure, some common medications can increase their likelihood of seizures (such as trifexis and comfortis).
Just because your pet has never had a seizure before does not mean that it is unlikely to happen. Every pet worh seizures began having them at some point. Or... they could occur at times nobody is at home."

Veterinary,f22jwfk,t3_dbe5ld,1569890624.0,"Ask them if you are expected to wear scrubs or interview attire. Some clinics have first and second round interviews.  If that is the case first round =interview attire  second round =scrubs. If you don't have any, run to goodwill or Walmart for inexpensive pair.  If they want you in scrubs, it's a working interview.  They will have you assisting around the clinic to see your comfort level there. My advice, jump in and help where you can to show you are not timid.  

Avoid saying things like...
... I just love animals.
... I've always wanted to be a veterinarian. 
... I want to work with puppies&kittens.
They know all that or you wouldn't be there. You sound basic. You're in for a shock because it's not all puppy/kitty snuggles. 

Tell them your good qualities (ex. Fast learner, hard working, cleanly, well-organized, people skills  etc.) And your previous experiences that you can use to your advantage (customer service, computer skills, any medical classes, medical terminology, etc.) 

Be honest about your lack of experience,  but how much you look forward to learning in order to provide patients with quality medical care. If you are interested in pursuing further education in the field, let them know that or any other future goals relevant to this or any other field."

Veterinary,eytm0zf,t1_eytavqm,1567440019.0,"When you look up a microchip number, you can get the info of the owner only if they register their microchip.  Sometimes you can see the info of the place that purchased the microchip like the vet clinic, animal shelter or rescue. Sometimes that info is not available. But if the owner did not register the chip *many don't. You can use the chip number to identify the owner if the clinic, shelter or rescue kept the records."
Veterinary,eys5ybi,t1_eys4jlh,1567388070.0,But how do you feel about the stance of your clinic. Do you feel any ethical obligation the the registered chip owner?
Veterinary,eys5r8n,t1_eyrwvkn,1567387910.0,"I read your comment in its entirety. I empathize with what you are saying, but honestly believe that the previous owners should be contacted. You did the right thing in having your cat scanned in the first place and carry no fault for the faulty scanner. However, you don't know the circumstances of the previous owner. There are several possible outcomes.

1. The contact information is outdated or microchip never registered. But at least your conscience is clear.
2. The previous owners are no longer interested in taking the cat back, or allow you to keep the cat because they understand the position you were in but feel relieved that they now know the fate of their former pet. They no longer question if it is alive or dead. They know it has a loving home. Your conscience is clear.
3. They want their cat back. They are prepared to take the case to court. *I feel like this scenario is unlikely* But at least you know that the cat had such a great loving home that they are willing to put forth that fight. Either way the cat has a loving family. You may or may not have a cat, but your conscience is clear."
Veterinary,eys4ps8,t1_eyryycg,1567387044.0,"Yes. I was looking up the old owner because I think we are morally bound to do so.

I then agreed that the client was not providing the ideal care for dog. I just stated that we are the client's primary veterinary care provider... which is how I know ideal medical care was not currently being provided."
Veterinary,eys4h2j,t1_eys1ock,1567386838.0,See I was told I could not give the client the personal information of the original owner. All I could do was give them the microchip number and the brand of chip for them to contact the company themselves.
Veterinary,eyrvwg3,t1_eyrv6r2,1567379797.0,This scares me too. I do not want my clinic to adopt this policy. This is why it is an ethical hot topic. One that I feel strongly on. It's something that needs to be discussed and legal actions taken for an agreed upon resolution.

Veterinary,eyruvue,t3_cygbob,1567378969.0,"Furthermore... my quandary is with how far as a vet health provider should one go in order to track the previous owner down? When I searched for the microchip, I have a first name, first letter of last name (not the full last name), an address in another state, and the shelter who firstly microchipped the dog. I don't have anyway to directly contact the previous owner. I tried to call the shelter for a phone number, but they were closed at the time. I made myself a note to try again when I go to work on Tuesday.  I gave the client the number to the shelter with the dog's microchip number so that she could try to call as well. I can't drive to the address of an unknown person in another state to ask if they still want their dog...!"
Veterinary,eyru7ai,t1_eyrss17,1567378413.0,"I understand exactly what you mean. My cat made herself at home on my front porch seat one morning. I brought her inside and brought her to work with me the next workday. She had a microchip registered under an adoption agency. The contact information they had on the owner was outdated. They offered to take her back for readoption, but I told them she would be fine staying with me while I searched the area for her family. I asked all around. No one knew who the owners were but had seen her around for over 6 months. I continued to check to see if her microchip was reported missing or updated with contact info. I'm not sure when I decided she belonged to me, but as far as the rescue was concerned, she has a happy home and her adoption few was already paid for."
Veterinary,eyrtfid,t1_eyrsjbv,1567377784.0,"I agree. But you would never know if the dog was really abused. Even if the client claims it is from an abusive home, without physical signs of abuse the client could be lying."
