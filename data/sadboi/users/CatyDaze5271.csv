maryland,f4bw2am,t1_f4buwc9,1571519459.0,"It's a lot of socially economic inconveniences that they cause main landers. Everyone thinks they're valuable because of watermen-their population doesn't make up a quarter of Maryland watermen let alone a quarter of the Eastern shores. They think because they live on an island that they deserve a break on everything. Well no one told you to live on an island. They are all large, elizabethians that eat and pray and judge and manipulate everyone all while their children run around mainland shooting up heroin, dying and leaving needles all around for our kids to pick up.

There are plenty of islanders that have moved away that will tell you the same. It's nothing political. It's strictly personal. Their minds and mentalities are that of minimal primates and they pollute our community.

Going on year 7. I'm about 3 months ""clean"". I know that's probably a ridiculous phrase to use but it makes me feel like a junky when I just need to ""get my fix"" of hospital validation that my mind is just tricking my body.

It's all gonna be okay though. It has to be. There has to be more to life than this. We can't all have done something so bad to deserve this life.
