MomForAMinute,f5zls0g,t3_dpt4hx,1572580057.0,"Hey Sib, as someone who had to burn bridges with her own Mom and then her (now ex) husband for her sanity, I wanna say that I’m really proud of you. The rise to making that decision is really a trial especially with how society tends to view family and marriage. You’ve been incredibly brave and I hope this way forward leads you down a happier path to more peaceful pastures. Big internet hugs from me to you!"
toastme,f4l6kkh,t3_dkvd5y,1571663028.0,I’m sorry life has been so tough on you. You’ve been so strong through this awful year. I’m currently going through chemo for breast cancer at 30 and seeing that you made it gives me hope! Thank you for being an inspiration! Here’s wishing you a beautiful and happy fresh start to life with your partner!
AskReddit,f3a5a72,t3_dg7pji,1570762064.0,"Mostly knew a long time before but he was really good at gaslighting. Leading up to the wedding he made me jump through more and more hoops to please his family, assuring me that it would be all better once it was all done. It never was. A week in, I needed to get away from an abusive family member (we were supposed to move to another country together in a month so we weren’t living together then), and I asked to move in with him. The reply was “It’s my parents’ house, I can’t do anything.” The straw that broke the camel’s back."
MomForAMinute,f2eisa0,t3_dctkhu,1570196450.0,"Hey Sib, just wanted to say I’m really proud of you for being so brave to take that decisive step. I went through the same thing just last year with pretty much that exact sort of person (7 years) but that gave me the freedom to focus, re-center and most importantly, heal.

You can do this! You can finally be the amazing person you want to be. Maybe start with things you always wanted to do but didn’t get to because you were with them, and yes that includes validating yourself. Here’s a big hug and wishing you a beautiful journey into the rest of your life."
MomForAMinute,f2ei3zo,t1_f2egmmu,1570195925.0,"Just wanted to say thanks for this reply though I’m not OP. I’m 30, I found a lump and it was stage 2 breast cancer. I’m going through chemo now and doing well in Phase 2 of treatment where Phase 1 was the hardest. Thank you for validating even my journey while helping another.

To OP, my bestest of wishes for you in that it turns out not to be a cause for worry either way. Best if it’s not the big C even so, know that knowing more means you can take the right and necessary steps. We’re all rooting for you!"

toastme,f1otmbi,t1_f1or60e,1569662388.0,It’s been pretty harrowing and some days I have trouble recognising myself. Trying to take it one day at a time as I still have a long way to go on this. Thank you for showing me what it looks like at the end of the tunnel!
toastme,f1or1gq,t3_dad6b1,1569658438.0,Seeing you healthy and in remission gives me hope! (Going through chemo and targeted therapy for breast cancer currently). You’re going to do amazing on that PhD proposal! Go you!

MomForAMinute,f070r09,t1_f06wgil,1568449952.0,Definitely more reason to pick it up again and keep going then!
MomForAMinute,f05xuhs,t1_f05m5bm,1568422948.0,"I’ve read that series! Well partway at least. It got a little bit long in the middle so I took a break but I’m definitely going back to it now! I do enjoy similar authors in her genre like Leigh Bardugo, V.E Schwab and Katherine Arden. Some of my other favourites are Patrick Rothfuss and Neil Gaiman!"
MomForAMinute,f03quic,t1_ezy44ah,1568366434.0,Thank you so much for telling me that I’m on the right track! It’s helping to keep me going!
MomForAMinute,f03qrx6,t1_f0356ie,1568366346.0,"Thanks so much Sis, that affirmation helped me a lot. I’m building my sanctuary in my rented room and it’s finally a pretty solid version 1 (hopefully in version 2, when I get my own place, I’ll have a sweet kitten or pupper to share it with). And yes absolutely, please send me your recommended list! I have a Kindle that’s linked to the LA Public library so it’s really convenient."
MomForAMinute,ezzh47d,t3_d2yv0o,1568286847.0,"Hey Sib, I’m proud of you for taking action swiftly. It really makes all the difference. Even if it does turn out to be cancer (all the fingers crossed and pixie dust that it isn’t), you can get started on treatment early and get your life back sooner. The “worst outcome” literally hit me 2 months ago at 30 years old so I know how you feel. The important thing is to always get clarification and as much  information as possible so that you know how to move forward. Many hugs and best of luck!"

MomForAMinute,eqnyjz3,t1_eqmoqxt,1560181851.0,Thanks Sib. It really helps to know that it’s okay and things aren’t really falling apart.
MomForAMinute,eoz6bg6,t3_bte37i,1558955947.0,"Hey Sib, that outright sucks and I’m angry for you cuz my mom and sis could very well do the same and I’d absolutely feel that way. Remember that you broke away for a reason and that you are better for it. I agree with asking your friends to help set boundaries by letting them know of your need for “non-disclosure”. You can and will get the life you want and deserve. Family isn’t always blood-related and it isn’t your fault that the one you were born into didn’t give you the love you needed."
MomForAMinute,eoql7rg,t3_bsopfk,1558793565.0,"That’s total goals Sib! I’m so happy for you that you have a place of your own! I’m working towards one day having that too. Right now renting away from an abusive family has given me so much peace, I can’t wait to see how it feels to own a place!"
