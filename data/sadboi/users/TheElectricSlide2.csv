Your weight gain is most likely from the antipsychotic. Ask about going off the antidepressant and the antipsychotic (which are obviously a pair in your case) and keeping the lithium with a new antiseizure med like carbamazepine. That's as weight neutral as it gets and much better for your mood than an antidepressant+antipsychotic. Docs who needlessly keep bipolar patients on antidepressants need their own heads examined.

Around 25 is the age when bipolar begins in earnest for the majority of people, so this makes sense. Nobody's doc is really able to make a diagnosis until the mania becomes obvious to the whole world. It's a major problem in the psychiatry profession. In hindsight I was bipolar for years before I was diagnosed 
The thing about right NOW is to avoid getting mad at her, and it sounds like you are doing a good job. You definitely should express anger LATER when she's in a better spot, especially if she doesn't stop with her avoidable triggers like drinking or if she won't go to therapy (or if she just plain does something fucked up üôÉ). But she's not going to be in a great place until she gets her meds right. Here's another thing - she shouldn't switch new meds for about 3 months (give each one a fair trial), even if there are side effects, unless the doc says that she has to. These meds have side effects that tend to go away with time. It's better to get used to a medication that's difficult at first then to keep switching. Give any med a 3 month trial period unless there are TRULY bad side effects and the doc say she needs to stop. Another tip - gaining more than 10% of bodyweight is truly a bad side effect. We live in America where nobody talks about getting fat as a bad thing any more so the docs won't care but with antipsychotics, massive weight gain can be just as deadly as bipolar over time but due to metabolic disorders.

bipolar,fqw06kv,t1_fqvz1v7,1589689305.0,"Ok that makes a lot more sense.

You're right about the spending money and the texting exes bring mania. Those are classic symptoms.

Getting into arguments like that is also a part of mania, even if it doesn't seem quite as carefree. So her meds will help (if the doc offers lithium, I highly recommend trying it since it's the only med that can put the illness in complete remission...assuming she responds to it). If the doc offers a stimulant or an antidepressant then get a second opinion. It's possible these would be a helpful choice but unlikely.

I also recommend finding a psychotherapist who specializes in DBT therapy. It's the best therapy for people with bipolar.

The biggest thing you will have to help her with is for the next few months is making sure she takes her meds. There's a fairly decent chance she will not want to at some point down the line. Under no circumstances can she stop a medication without doctor signing off on it. Even if she feels better or thinks her diagnosis is wrong.

She also needs to wake up every morning at the same time, even on weekends,even when she has nothing to do. Her internal clock is really screwed up right now and she needs to reset it for the sake of her mood.

She will definitely be bashful and sorry for what she's done. You seem like you are kind enough to be gracious in helping her understand she's not to blame!

No alcohol, drugs, or even coffee or nicotine (if possible). These are all kryptonite to a person with bipolar. Absolutely guaranteed to rekindle mania, even with medication.

She needs to mood chart. Use daliyo app and track medication compliance, alcohol/drug/caffeine/nicotine intake, mood, anxiety/irritability and hours slept. Chart each and every day.

You have an illness which, if left untreated, causes you to have manias (or hypomanias - less intense mania). Each mania is progressively worse than the last, and untreated hypomania will progress to mania. Each mania also causes damage to the brain which leads to worsening memory and cognitive problems. So you want to avoid mania.

After any mania comes a long period of depression, which is often severe. You're in the worst of it, I'm sorry to say. No quick solutions, but it gets better with time and as your brain and body heal. You can avoid mania if you:


1. Take your meds as prescribed (never miss a dose)


2. Have the same sleep schedule every day, even on the weekends


3. Avoid alcohol and drugs, and probably also caffeine and nicotine (your mileage may vary but don't ignore this possibility)


4. Have a therapist if possible. DBT therapy is best followed by CBT therapy. Generally speaking, psychiatrists are not that great at therapy because they were not trained or supervised to become therapists. There are some who are but do your homework.


5. Exercise daily. Even walking around the block is good enough if that's all you can do. You will be tired.


6. Annoy the heck out of your doc by reporting every symptom you have. If your doc is not willing to listen and responsive, get a new one.


7. Get a second opinion on meds if you are prescribed a stimulant or an antidepressant. These will likely push you to mania but even in 2020, against great scientific evidence, some docs (GP's in particular) feel like this is a good idea on the whole.


Avoid mania at all costs. If you can avoid mania, you'll live a great life. There's a steep learning curve. Im sure this is incomplete and doesn't answer all your questions so feel free to ask more!"

The number 1 best thing you can do other than meds is wake up at the same time every morning, even if you don't have anything to do."
bipolar,fqr5e9x,t3_gkgwxb,1589577912.0,"Most people have an incorrect understanding of rapid cycling. It's not when your mood changes during the day or even the week. It's when you go from bipolar depression to mania and back a certain number of times per year. Rapid cycling happens slowly, all things considered. 

People who are manic can still get sad during the day - people who are depressed can still laugh and smile.

Whether or not you are rapid cycling is semi useless info for patients, imho. It's mostly a technical issue about what kind of treatment you need coming off of mania."

My vote is that akathisia is more likely to be from rexulti   than Lamictal but to be honest I don't actually know. Still, those feelings are more common from antipsychotics or from the illness itself than from anticonvulsants"

bipolar,fqqrhch,t3_gkfjto,1589570640.0,"I've heard lot of stories of Abilify causing akathisia and agitation, never heard of it causing mania. It's a good med but it had unpleasant side effects for you your doc did the right thing to switch.


Depression after mania is normal, your brain is healing. It will take a good amount of time to feel regular, definitely don't stop your meds even if you want to. Talk to your doc or come here as often as you can with questions (preferably talk to your doc over just asking questions here)"
bipolar,fqq8vf0,t1_fqq6vhk,1589561384.0,"Here's why I recommend having a separate therapist (DBT therapy if you can find it)

1. Your doctor is not trained or supervised as a therapist. It's really unlikely that they are any good at therapy.

2. Doctors see all problems like increased depression as problems with your meds and not as problems with the quality or type of therapy you are getting from them

I've never even met you and I can bet you're not happy with your doc right now and that things aren't going as well with getting back on track as you'd like. Why? Because this situation you're in is common and predictable."
