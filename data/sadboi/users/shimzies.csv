we mustn’t forget the time, dedication and practice he puts into this though. it obviously took him a LOT to get where he is— and that’s exactly what makes him so special ʕ ᵔᴥᵔ ʔ"
FigureSkating,fnyx5x3,t1_fnxvyod,1587378994.0,"i agree with you. despite his jumps being utterly perfect, you really do see passion and life in them, which is weird for just a jump lmfao. i don’t feel like it’s just nathan but all skaters i’ve watched up until now really. none of them showed the “effort”, as you mentioned (not that he makes them look hard, but you can almost feel every movement he does?) idek where to begin goddamnit. the things he does man :’)"
FigureSkating,fnxeiyo,t3_g4g76m,1587337000.0,"yuzuru hanyu. no one can elaborate on the beauty and sincerity he puts into his programs. every move he does, every glide on the ice is well counted for. i’m sure all skaters are the same but.. there’s something profound and extraordinary about him that i can’t really put into words :’))) he makes me want to stay alive just to see what more would he offer the world. he truly is a legend."
