You need to take soo take many more things into consideration. Hatsoff to u for pulling this off so far btw, stay strong buddy. There's no point in ruing our decisions, what's happened has happened. Keep calling your family, if u ever feel too lonely u can dn me, we can chat up nd rant to each other :-). 

Yea, I'll definitely try to go to one. I was already thinking anyways, now this has completely messed me up anyways.

Oh yes, nd the worst thing is it being in schools. I'm a South indian who has spent almost all his childhood in north India, nd yes ik I was unlucky for meeting the wrong ppl I guess
......but I have been subjected to sooo much racism throughout. Like, throughout. It honestly broke me nd I'm still  recovering,tho it's better now. The divide is too huge among states nd communities, nd it's a case of constant one upism not just in appearance,but also job, status etc. It's exhausting. 

Oh yea, I hope u raise children who are truly accepting. More power to u!"

So guess what....my mom made me get literal chemical peels to try to remove it, went to the dermatologist many times etc. 'Unfortunately', it hasn't come off. But that was just one aspect, the thing that affected me the most was the casual racism I faced in my school. We indians are so racist even towards ourselves. I'm not a particularly good looking guy, but I was always taunted for my colour and features and it has really affected my self esteem long term. It's really deeply ingrained,  and It requires parents especially to really teach their children these diverse values."
