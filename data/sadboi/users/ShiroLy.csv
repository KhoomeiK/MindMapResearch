bangx3/ fantastic baby - bigbang

me guestas tu - gfriend

replay/ring ding dong - shinee

I am the best - 2ne1

Mirotic- tvxq

my house - 2pm

rainism - rain

sorry sorry - suju

nobody - wonder girls

growl - exo


this will definetly change in a few years when the 4th gen takes over and songs from 3rd gen groups/artists will be considered the (new) iconic kpop songs, probably including songs like

love scenario - ikon

fire/bst - bts

cheer up/ fancy - twice

move - taemin

shine - pentagon 

gotta go - chungha

Shadow would probably be up there with my favourite albums of theirs but mots 7 is kinda messy.

Knowing that IZ\*ONE will finally come back soon and a possible X1 cb shortly after and the rumored BTS cb in january i will try to not impulse buy anything else as of now. I might finally get the NCT 2018 - empathy, WayV - take over the moon or nct dream - we go up/ the first albums, as i'm so close to completing my nct collection.

I agree with most of the things you said about each song except umpah umpah, i feel like im the only one who LOVES loves this song... it just such a fun song that sparks happiness and yeri's rap is everything. 

I'd probably rank them

1)Psycho

kpopcollections,fcoa8wv,t3_ei0b13,1577827325.0,"i have only really started collecting this year, i had only two albums at the beginning of the year. My collection isnt big or anywhere near complete but im happy with the growth it had in one year (and i currently need to reorganize my collection cuz im running out of space on my shelves :))

1. How many albums have you purchased in 2019? 
i bought 34 albums if i counted correctly.Additionally, I also got one tour dvd (bts love yourself in europe).

2. What is the breakdown of those albums? (i.e. how many are boy group, girl group or solo releases)
27 bg, 3 (male) solos, 3 gg and 1 (female) solo album. 6 of them are japanese releases but i assume they count just as well.

3. Have you purchased any signed albums?
i purchased one as of now, ab6ix' debut album B: Complete. I was itching to buy some more, but i apparently have a little bit of self-control left :))

4. What has been your favourite release (music-wise) in 2019?
Out of the albums i own it would probably be seventeens you made my dawn. The whole album is just perfection and almost a year after the release i still love it just as much. It is just such a comfort album to me.

5. What has been your favourite release (packaging-wise) in 2019?
oneus - fly with us. I really like the packaging for all of their albums and was impressed with their debut album packaging already. All of their 3 albums are similar packaging wise, but their most recent album is my favourite. It's box style packaging that you can simply slide out to the side. I'm not the biggest fan of regular box style packaging cuz it can be a pain to open them.  This one is so simple but somehow fairly uncommon packaging.

6. What has been your least favourite release (packaging-wise) in 2019?
i praised them for music, but not the packaging: svt - ymmd. I know some people might disagree on that one but i don't really like the packaging for their ymmd series. You can flip through the photobook without fearing the cd might fall out while you hold it, and it closes kinda weirdly.

7. Have you managed to buy anything rare/out of print you’ve been searching for?
no, not really, as i was more focused on building my collection from scratch. I keep an eye on loona albums tho and hope to find some of their oop solo/unit albums for a decent price one day. I'd also love to collect dreamcatcher, but i seriously can not add them to my list rn

8. What are your plans for 2020?
My first goal is to complete my nct collection and i am finally starting my red velvet collection with the reve festival finale, i'll continue from there. I want to grow my shinee collection as well but it is not my main focus atm. I also want to buy some more solo albums and some of my favorite albums of groups i don't necessarily (plan to) collect."

unpopularkpopopinions,eywkawt,t1_eyw1ipb,1567531447.0,"same here tbh
I listen to music pretty much all day and mostly kpop. I stan a lot of groups and listen to their newer and older albums but I also check out most comebacks that I know of and give most rookie groups a shot. If I like the title I'll check out the full album and older tracks. That being said I am always behind with all the extra content, especially vlives. If they are live, I have time and am in the right mood I might watch it but if it's not one of my ult groups I probably wont watch it later. I mean even with my ults I'm behind but it's just not necessary for me to watch all of their lives and behind videos all the time. I do watch a lot of live stages and bigger variety show appearances as well as survival shows but apart from that its so-so. Like e.g. I am ARMY since 2016 but have probably watched less bangtan bombs and bts run episodes than I have not. I stan groups whom I have watched maybe 2 vlives off but I am fine with it, I prefer to watch crack videos and compilations on yt instead. I appreciate the content but for me personally it's not that neccessary and just too much considering all the groups I stan. Each their own I guess"

It's disgusting that in 2019 people think this is okay. He should trust your word and not need his family to check wether or not your hymen is still intact, especially as this proves nothing. If he can't give up this outdated ""tradition"" for his future wive he isn't husband material. Talk to him, and if he doesn't see how it's wrong and won't change his mind better blow off the wedding. I am sorry but at least you learned this before marrying him and probably save yourself being hurt in the future. Anyhow best of luck and I hope you make the right decision for yourself 💕"
KDRAMA,eykma1s,t1_eyklf37,1567159347.0,"yeah but romi grabs him a bit later than his gf and you can see he is somewhat hesitant when she was pulling him in, but as he turns around and sees hy he quickly runs over and holds onto him before even looking back at his gf... idk that's what I got from it"
KDRAMA,eykl96r,t1_eyawcy0,1567157805.0,"the way he looks at him, e.g. when they were in front of the lockers with his girlfriend and romi but ohje had eyes for hy only? when they were playing the game where they had to get together in groups to survive and he chose hwiyoung's team even tho his girlfriend had already grabbed him. the basketball scene a few episodes ago... also how he excused or tried to explain & downplay hy misbehavior towards jw when talking to him. You'd normally take the side of your friend but he sorta protected hy. It just seems like he's got a thing for him, little things like that add up until it's hard to deny. But ofc you could find other reasons for his behaviour, it's just how I see it and seems like the most obvious one to me."
KDRAMA,exl0ymq,t3_csdfc7,1566403582.0,"Those were definetly some of my favourite episodes so far, especially ep 10. I was afraid it would be getting really frustrating again but I am glad soobin/junwoo could clear up their misunderstanding rather quickly. 
God if they don't mess up towards the end, this could become one of my favourite dramas, at least this year. I am way too invested in our main couples relationship, I don't think I have shipped an official or main couple that hard for a while, not only within kdrama but pretty much all media i consumed recently. They are just too adorable together and I love both characters so much. (I am so thankful seongwoo and moonbin are starring in this drama or else I might have not watched it)

One of my favourite parts was when junwoo went up stage at the school festival/show thing and sang (for soobin^'^). I didn't exactly expect to see seongwoo sing ""live"" in the drama and it was nice to see him on stage again? idk the whole scene was just cute. I was afraid that Soobin and junwoo wouldnt find each other after his performance for the dance, especially as we saw hwiyoung talk about not letting jw ""take it from him"", but gladly they did meet. I hope we will see them become an official couple soon. 

Other than that I think we were now proven that oh je is gay? Or at least queer and has a crush on hwiyoung. Like I've been saying this since ep 1, but now it's no longer just speculation, right? I was really excited to see that, I've been disappointed by queerbaiting too many times to count. I get it for kdrama, but it's still immensely frustrating.
""Still, It's a good thing that you can like someone"",
""I am not interested in any girl"",
""Do you like someone that you shouldn't?"" 
like it's real ya? They can hardly back out now. When they did this game and oh je grabbed hwiyoung oof. He's so adorable and how he acts around hy reminds me of myself in high school with my crush sksk. This drama is pure but realistic with its relationships and I really like that aspect. 

Another part was the building relationship (even tho we can't really call it that yet) between jw and sb mother. I also liked the interactions between those two mothers and their kids those episodes. 

Romi comming clear about her lies and the other girls being there for her was great. I feel for her and I am glad that her friends are still there for her, even after all she did. I hope she is able to let jw/sb be and stops manipulating their relationship but I am honestly not so sure about that. Idk where the writer will take her storyline tbh. 

Ah I almost forgot that we got sanghoon back, its gonna be interesting how the relationship between him jw and hy evolves further. 

I felt sorry for ki tae and pil sang at the end even tho it was expected to happen. 

Well I am really looking forward to the next episodes esp. as it seems as if we will get more direct & happy sb/jw interactions and I'm all here for it. I guess the main ""problem"" for their rs will be SB's mom for now, but we can be sure hat hy will try something as well... let's pray they are stronger."
KDRAMA,ewu90ke,t3_cp80y8,1565770009.0,"I was so glad that junwoo/soobin finally went on a date but then what exactly happened? please I thought we were over hwiyoung standing in between them and now sb/hy seem to become closer? pls no, I hope they get this sorted out by the end of ep10, I want to see some more happy moments of sb/jw as an actual couple & to allow more focus on some of the side stories & characters (esp. hr teacher, hy's family situation and oh je).

apropos oh je, if he ends up not being gay/queer I will not be surprised but majorly disappointed - c'mon these hints, don't play with me like that. I am still not sure wether or not he likes junwoo or hwiyoung tho. in the beginning I thought it was hwijoung then junwoo and now we got his dad knowing about jw and how handsome he is, the basketball scene with hy and the scene where he and oh je talk about soobin being his gf... idk what to think anymore. I want it to be hy cuz I love oj/jw friendship and we have our main couple ofc, also hy/oj would make a good dynamic as long as oj can get through to him. hr teacher and oh je getting hy to open up and supporting him with getting out of his situation would be great to see.
 
I seriously love this drama but I am so annoyed by the constant misunderstanding and wrong assumptions of jw/sb. please just TALK. I mean yeah that's nothing new, but it's the plot point I hate the most in (k)dramas, so frustrating. if it happens over and over again it's just annoying so please let this be the last time and I'll let it slide 🙃

anyhow if it helps sb&hy to become friends in the long run I guess I'm okay with it, cuz hy needs SOMEONE he can open up to and be comfortable with, even if I personally don't think it'll be sb, they have too much history and their families are too close? (if you get the way I mean that, cuz they arent close close but in contact w/ each other so yeah..)"

KDRAMA,ewbkor2,t1_ew5hx21,1565268095.0,"I agree with most of the thing you said, and at first I felt the same about romi, but atm I am actually just intrested in where they are going with her storyline. So far joonwoo has shown no interest in her and with his confession towards Soobin I can only hope she does not misunderstand their relationship again. If it was another drama I think I would be more annoyed by her, but I think we will get to know more about her personal problems and reasons as well.

Apart from that I am mostly curious about oh je and cant wait to see more of him . I was glad to see that you are speculating about his sexuality as well, cuz that's what I've been thinking the past episodes, but wouldn't dare to believe it... I keep telling me that I am reading too much into it and shouldn't have high hopes for queer rep (esp as this drama is already so good, two of my faves and displays really interesting relationships). Either way he has been one of my favourite characters from the beginning and I'm looking forward to dive deeper into his storyline. 

I am also curious about what's up with the former hr teacher and his connection to hwi youngs family."
