N95 masks are called ""95"" because they only allow 5% airborne penetration of the smallest particles. Sewn cloth masks allow 97-100% penetration. In regards to OP's mention of donating to hospitals, unfortunately some hospitals reject them or do not want them.

I am just trying to share facts. I can link articles if you want. My point is that while the efforts are appreciated, some hospitals don't want it. So be aware instead of saying ""this is not true"", and be sure to check with your local hospital."

Thank you for assuring me that it's okay to accept how I feel, and for helping me zoom out and realize there are so many factors playing a role in my life.

I've worn it since I was 10, and now I'm in my early 20's.  I am exhausted to my core from the microaggressions, the judgement and the harsh comments from Muslims and non-Muslims. My friends are taking off their hijabs, one by one. 

I barely even pray so I'm wondering why I keep wearing hijab. I tell myself maybe this hijab will be my ticket to Jannah. Maybe it will testify for me. I don't know how or why but I still wear it everyday even though it brings me to tears. Wallahi this struggle is so draining. Is it even worth it?"

step1,ey7bfqb,t1_ey2tien,1566877325.0,"You got this! 8 weeks is a good amount of time. I took 4 months but half of it was me wasting time and not studying, so don't do that lol. Are you planning on using FA or pathoma? B&B lists corresponding FA pages so even skimming over those pages for a few mins before watching the videos should help you organize everything in your mind. 

I also really recommend Pathoma. You can  listen to it while driving or during breaks on 1.5X speed. Idk about you, but during dedicated I had to hear the content many times in many different ways before I could actually remember thing long term. So for example I read the FA path section for each organ system, but also did pathoma for that organ system too. This helped a ton.

Make sure to test yourself WHILE you're studying the organ systems. I regret not doing this. I would just read FA/ do B&B/ do pathoma..... then move on without doing questions. Don't make this mistake. Use UW topic specific questions, or even Kaplan or RX questions to test yourself.

And lastly, the UW journal won't let you down! If you stick with it and keep reviewing those incorrects, you will shock yourself with the detailed content you'll be able to recall and apply on test day."

step1,ey7amxg,t1_ey4p2bw,1566876615.0,"Hey! 3.5 weeks is a great amount of time. Doing UW random timed helped me a lot. Make sure to not get very caught up in the reviewing process. Write the Q/A sentences of our missed questions in your UW journal and move on. As long as you're reviewing your UW journal for 30 mins to 1 hour per night, your score should go up. In the beginning of my prep I spent more time on FA/B&B and did only 20 timed random UW questions per day, but the end of my prep I did 2 UW timed random blocks per day, reviewed them, then spent the rest of the day on a specific organ system. It really depends how far you are through UW. After CBSE in 3.5 weeks are you planning on taking step right after?

 Aside from UW, for organ systems  i did 1 organ system over 3-4 days, with annotating B&B into FA. If you find your pace is too slow, maybe don't watch every single B&B video for that organ system, only the stuff you're struggling with. One thing I wish I did more was testing myself over the organ systems with Kaplan or RX Qbanks. You could also do 20 topic specific organ system UW questions at the end of the night just to test yourself. And when you get tired of studying, you can throw in some relevant sketchy micro/ pharm videos as a break."
