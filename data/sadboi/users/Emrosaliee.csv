My mom didn’t have a ton of options (single mother who worked long hours) and both of us are paying the consequences to this day. I feel a tremendous amount of guilt for being manipulated into turning against my mother, even though I was too little to defend against it or even know what was happening. 

I am also codependent, have anxiety and am prone to depression. Through therapy I have learned that whatever emotional tactics my grandmother employed were so traumatic I dissociated most of my time with her when I was small. Please don’t let them do this to your kids. It is way too much for anyone to handle.

If you want to talk more about my experience, PM me and I’ll be happy to share. BTW, I love and appreciate my mom and hold no resentment- now. It took me YEARS to undo all the nastiness my grandmother snuck into my mind."

depression,fdmif9d,t3_em5dey,1578551034.0,"So the thing about therapy is number one... you have to actually be open to doing some hard work. You won’t want to do it. You’ll feel like its dumb and it doesn’t help. You will feel like not putting in any effort. But it gets easier. And the work turns into things you enjoy. But you have to want it. You really have to push and struggle and fight for the life you deserve.

The other thing is, you have to actually get a therapist who fits with you. Who you really mesh with and who can get things across to you in a way you understand. Think of it like finding a good hair salon. You have to shop around if its not working out. If they are good, therapists will usually be able to recommend you to other facilities and other therapists. 

Most of all- your mom sounds like she is at least enabling you to seek help. She may be dramatic, but most likely she is scared for her baby and feeling helpless because she can’t make it better. You can do this! Work work work and don’t look back. I believe in you!"

There is usually a time limit as to when you can submit a report for an incident- if you don’t officially submit a report when things happen they may be useless to you. Ultimately my advice is do what you have to do to keep yourself safe from harassment. You are responsible for your personal safety. 

On another note- find yourself another job with a more professional security team and a better manager. Customer service like that is incredibly hard to secure and obviously makes it easier for people to get to you.

RBNSpouses,fbbgwu6,t3_ecge3i,1576700221.0,"Wow... I can’t believe this, but your post is an almost exact mirror of what I’ve been going through with my partner over the past week. I had a family funeral to attend, and finally broke. I drew a line in the sand with him and gave him a month to commit to therapy or I would leave. It makes it hard because I know that he truly has good intentions most of the time when his anger doesn’t take over. I know he is scared, and I know he wasn’t taught how to be an emotionally functional adult due to his upbringing. BUT, he makes me feel bad. Unimportant. Not valued. Isolated. Put down. He projects a lot of fear into this relationship and gets angry at himself. Then projects it on to me because he can’t fix it. He has routinely attempted to make his emotional struggle my responsibility. And with my grandma’s death, I had finally had enough.

OP, make an exit plan and stick to it. Your feelings are valid, and this isn’t your fault. What is most important is that you get yourself into therapy so you can get acquainted with you again. Even if he fully heals, there are scars and reactions you have been conditioned to have- you probably don’t even realize they are there. Help yourself first and don’t even worry about what he is doing right now. If he wants this enough, he’ll do it. If he doesn’t, you are going to have to be ok with that and with yourself.

Congratulations for standing up!! I know, it isn’t easy and its emotionally draining to go through all of this. PM me if you ever need to talk! You aren’t alone"
