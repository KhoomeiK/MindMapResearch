While this is true, I also think it didn‚Äôt touch upon the lively, creepy details the early adaptation had, let alone those in the book. So, I enjoyed the 1989 version much more, to be frank. The acting was kind of cheesy at times, but hear me out: what made up for it was the successful dark tone. One thing I especially liked about 1989 was Louis‚Äô expressions (or lack thereof). He had this eerie, blank face most of the time, and while it was some inches off from the book version of Louis (who certainly was portrayed as going crazy in all senses of the word [think: Hey Ho, let‚Äôs go]), it was a somewhat sinister display of deadness, one that I could nonetheless resonate with."
