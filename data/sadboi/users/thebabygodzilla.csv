adderall,fqdr3ed,t3_gi6hmq,1589295114.0,"I hate unmedicated days, I am so sorry you have to have some. 

Try to be kind to yourself first and foremost. Remember ADHD (assuming that's what you take it for) is a disability. It is okay if you aren't up to par with everyone else, or even yourself on normal days. 

As far as practical advice, I try to make daily to-do lists, completing the easiest tasks first. There are lots of good resources on YouTube, especially for being unmedicated. Specifically the channel HowToADHD has info on this topic. 

Good luck, and I hope you're able to cope or get a refill soon!"

There are also lots of great resources online, including the ADHD subreddit. I watched a lot of YouTube videos when I was first diagnosed, and there is a lot of good info there about coping strategies while unmedicated"
