Don't act like you know me, I have been in two relationships with people who suffered from depression and severe anxiety. And as someone who is bipolar, I know that people can be helped by their SO, and yes I know that you can only do so much especially when the depression is severe. 

If someone leaves you because you are depressed and they don't try and help and they aren't being supportive then they don't fucking deserve you. And if they tried helping and did all they could to push you to get help or whatever and then you refused help and just drowned in your depression everytime then it's on you. And I know how fucking hard it is to take initiative to get help. When you're depressed you're devoid of all motivation, pleasure and life in general.

The bipolar is a really long story but what I really struggled with is the depression side of it, I got the mania under control 3 years ago. Paired with severe anxiety, when my depression is not under control, I go through periods of feeling drowned in horrible, dark, violent, and all around f*cked up thoughts that I struggle to get out of my head. Even when I am simply watching a movie I enjoy or am with family or friends I love, the anxiety can kickstart a cascade of spiraling thoughts that goes on for what feels like forever. Then the depression feeds off of that and kills my ability to enjoy anything, my motivation, my energy and it can reach the point where I don't feel anything and nothing will save me.

The depression and anxiety share a synergistic bond, so they feed into one another. It's hell.

I have had loads of suicidal thoughts but know I would never act on it, there is always light i can hold onto in the darkest times. 

Hundreds of millions of people or Moe struggle with mental disorders. You are not alone in your fight. There are always people known or unknown to you who can help, I just hope those who have a hard time finding that help get it and that they get it soon.

Hang in there, you matter. ❤️"
