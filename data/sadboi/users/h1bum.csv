Being alive is sufficient, so ""programming"" for the extra mile won't make a difference on survival chances. Unless of course you're working your body as hard as humans evolved to do, but most humans don't even come close to the hard labor or bodies are capable of. And we've evolved to respond to the extra demand.

The ""usual"" figure varies a lot depending on who you ask. So fill use whatever source you wanna go with.

Juice is 80-88% water. Soda 90-99%. Yeah some sugar is good. But having experience working at a gas stations, the people who get daily sodas are the ones who honestly could loose a decent amount of weight. I dont say that in a judgmental way, whatever they wanna do is there choice. I dont think them lesser. Nor you for disagreeing. Live how ya wanna live. Not my business. Also, soda and juice have lots of extra stuff for your body to process in addition to water, which is more your body needs to have your body deal with which means more fluids used. 

But this is ultimately a pointless conversation because you can do your own test to see what feels better. Loads of water cant hurt. But you do you man."

Like... you're for real? ANY?! OMG!!!! THE POSSIBILITIES?!?!?! Eventually my mind came to Victorian London. My mind ran with that idea for ages. It was my most wished for setting. 

Then we got the game... and it felt.... juvenile. I barely even remember the villain. So forgettable and cookie cutter. Every 5 minutes the game was screaming in your face ""Hey I'm a historical character! Chat with me! This game has so much history! Ok now go kill people for me! Bye bye now!"". The guns were so.... unsatisfying. The combat. Arkham style? Really? I mean it kinda fits the whole brawler/gang theme... but in an Assissins Creed game? Seriously? Parkour was such a backseat thing. It corralled you into using the zipline gun. I avoided using it for hours but eventually you just had to use it. 

There werent any emotional high or lows really. I mean... I guess seeing the Kenway manor was cool? But looking back not a single moment stands out as memorable. The hospital mission was fun. But again. Story wise? Not engaging. I frequently remember and talk about all the AC games story. They all had moments that got me. Even my least favorite of the series ACIII (I closely watched the development of that and the made many promise and kept almost none. Making Paul Reveres ride feel like that was... cruel.) had a good story. Conner and Haythen played so well off each other. It worked.

Now dont get me wrong. There were thing I liked. The Dlc was good fun. I mean... it was weird. But it felt like what if and it was good fun to mess with. Jacob and Evie had some good banter at times. Nothing overly memorable tho... but still. It wasnt a bad thing. The train hideout felt cool and Unique. Although I hated running around to catch up to it. There probably was a fast travel point inside the train I'm forgetting. Outfit customization was fun. The skills were mostly good. I didnt like the ones that felt super ultra gamey but that's personal taste not quality. 

All that said.... nothing wrong with you enjoying it. If you liked it I'm happy for you. I can be picky with my games I'll admit but hey my wallet my choices. So personally. Now that I think about i think i dislike this one more then i do ACIII. That one had a good story as well as gameplay I didnt like. Syndicate didnt have either going for me.
