As for your first question, every IP treatment center is different. What I can promise you however is that you absolutely is sick enough to receive treatment. From my experience, a lot of places doesn‚Äôt take your weight into much consideration when it comes to ED‚Äôs, they‚Äôre more focused on your ED behaviours. 

I‚Äôm guessing from what you wrote, that you may be going to a place that takes both acute and planned patients. If that‚Äôs the case, you will probably be put on a waiting list until they have a place for you, and from my understanding you shouldn‚Äôt be moved further back on that list regardless of symptoms, as they may have a certain amount of beds for acute patients, therefore you‚Äôre not taking the space for someone who may be in mirage urgen need of help.


As for how long you will be able to stay, varies from place to place. But they should tell you something about that when you see them for the first time. I‚Äôve been at places where you only stay for a couple weeks at most, to places where you can stay for over a year, so it‚Äôs quite hard to guess how long your stay may be.
