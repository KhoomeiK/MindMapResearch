I personally can answer about tv shows and go wild with them, talking and making conversations about it. But music? Even if I ask someone else about it, I've got nothing to add.
And that does not make me boring."

Overwatch,ff3mwac,t3_eredvc,1579544459.0,"I'm one of them sometimes. I play for fun and sometimes that's just how I have fun. Not thinking and playing, usually listening to some music in the backround. Sometimes I'm just so caught up in a conversation with someone, that I end up not thinking and playing. Sometimes my anxiety takes over and even if I want to play well, I can't.

But there are plenty of days where I think more about what I do, call out and have fun that way. I still don't get mad at others who either can't play like that or just don't play that well in general or on a certain day, game, because I know how it feels and because I've been one of them. I understand them and, honestly, the game's more fun that way. There's much less rage.

I really wish more people understood this instead of yelling at your teammates at how dumb they are. It's like yelling at a first grader (who hasn't learnt the alphabhet yet) for not knowing the alphabhet. And spelling it loudly to them while yelling it in a horrible tone that makes them feel stupid for not knowing it- A, B, C, D, E, F, G.. etc. It usually does not help them. You just make them feel bad. That's why constructive critisms exsist. It's much more helpful and people could actually learn better. Don't expect it to be instant though or to happen all the time. Not everyone trusts that a strangers game knowledge is better than theirs. Or they might just not want to or feel like improving. Or they think that they're already amazing at the game. Either way, yelling or being toxic at strangers rarely helps."
