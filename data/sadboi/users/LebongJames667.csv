For me reality checking has been a lot to do with paranoia and anxiety, and some delusions.

If i get paranoid about being in public, wondering what people think of me or if they look down on me, i just think ""i dont know anyone here and they dont know me"" which helps me to understand my paranoia or anxiety is unnecessary, and im just being triggered. For delusional thoughts like thinking there was a conspiracy or delusions of grandeur, i just think about how i am just myself, and sort of just know that we all live in the same reality, and that i have a mental illness that makes me paranoid or illogical. Sometimes i just take deep breaths and clear my mind as much as i can, realizing i dont need to always be thinking. Its been a process of taking care of myself, 
taking it easy on myself, and listening to my doctors advice, but nowadays im pretty upbeat. This is night and day compared to my mental state for a good 5 plus years, and its tough at times but im able to move on from self doubt and feeling down. Im a work in progress still, but i actually am happy a lot nowadays, which is nice. I feel like i have learned a lot through the tough times too, so i try not to look back with any anger anymore.

Despite trying to quit a few times, it was always tough to really stop smoking. For me what has worked is using some cbd to counteract the lack of thc im so used to. I have cbd to smoke, which has helped because i can smoke it, using a clean bong, and it just lightly calms me. Even a big hit of cbd just has subtle effects. Anyway not everyone can get cbd to use in place of thc, and if you can do it without cbd more power to you, but for me it has worked. I have ""withdraw"" symptoms still, like trouble eating and sleeping, but with cbd i have been able to stay away from the bud still. Now that it is day 3, it is the easiest time ive had without weed for years. I dont have plans to smoke the chronic, and im feeling pretty good that i finally stopped. I even have a lot of good bud still, but im not smoking it. With cbd, it doesnt make me want to smoke it all the time, like regular ganja.
