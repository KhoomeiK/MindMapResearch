Posted this before was downvoted to oblivion. From what I see those who is on the Hindu supremacy agenda aka bhakts. Want to consolidate the Hindu and anyone else that isn't Muslim in India then create a US Vs them mentality by magnifying every bad thing Muslim do be it inside or outside India but if their side do it then they will defend it to the hill. With reasoning such as India is a big nation of 1.3 billions people of course there will be some bad people but if it were the other side,see all Muslim are bad, terrorist,jihad and so on."
