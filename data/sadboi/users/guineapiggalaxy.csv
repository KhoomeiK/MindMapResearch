Blind,fg55f91,t3_ewt5bb,1580518714.0,"I think how you approached her and asked her if she needed anything was good.  You weren‚Äôt forceful or condescending IMO.  What I‚Äôd suggest is just talk, be yourself.  Pretty much what you would do with sighted people.  Ask her about herself, get to know her.  You guys could go out somewhere."

Blind,fcxxokr,t3_eese4i,1578071957.0,I tend to either keep my folded up under my chair or I keep it straight and tuck the bottom behind my ankle and rest the top by my shoulder.  For my non folding canes I keep them in corners or under tables.
bipolar,fcxvsch,t1_fcxvq8t,1578071252.0,I‚Äôve been taking it kinda late around 11.
ExNoContact,fcxvnlp,t3_ejdeqg,1578071189.0,"This happened to me also.  It stings but you get over it.  The initial few weeks are pretty hard though.  Just remember to take care of yourself and have some fun,"
ExNoContact,fcxq26l,t1_fcx39s4,1578068768.0,"I get it!  That mindset isn‚Äôt for everyone.  Generally, I don‚Äôt either.  Not the type to just leave.  For me, In this particular circumstance- it means that if I love someone, I can‚Äôt allow them to keep hurting me and although I love them I have to leave.  I can‚Äôt keep arguing with them.  I can‚Äôt keep letting us fall apart or keep trying when he‚Äôs already given up.  I need to leave and let him be happy.

Edited for grammar mistake."
