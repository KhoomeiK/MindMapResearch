Gloomhaven is so long it can dominate your gaming group for over a year and campaigns play best when done with little interruption. I think Gloomhaven would have been a better game if it had 3 distinct campaigns within the same ""world"" (sharing Global achievements and prosperity). I hope a shorter campaign will allow for better balance as well, since there will be lower variance in item availability, prosperity, retirement perks, etc. The price is perfect as well.

I'm not sure I want to invest $100 in Frosthaven as I have reservations about the added mechanics, class design, and another long campaign. Not to mention I'm let down by the lack of improvements to core mechanics like shield, retaliate, and summons (scaling, movement, etc.)."

I played a lot of FFXI back in the day, and the Bard was a support class I've never seen duplicated in any other MMO. It was a buffing class with no heals or DPS (though in that game you got a ""sub-class"" so you could add some heals). Very few wanted to play it but it was in ridiculously high demand because a party with a Bard could literally double the effectiveness of a group. Groups would sometimes rather sit around and wait for hours than go do something without a Bard. FFXI also had a couple other classes that were DPS/buff hybrids or DPS/heal hybrids, none of which were popular. 

I haven't seen a single MMO where any form of support is popular. Even if the support does DPS, they always do less DPS which reduces their popularity right out of the gate."

""Low impact"" does not guarantee joint health, but it removes one source of joint damage.

If I recall correctly, rowing on the water or on the erg can be bad for you even with good form due to repetitive stress. Lots and lots of rowers develop back issues. This has nothing to do with being high or low impact though. Any repetitive action done to extremes can have this effect and in rowing the part of the body that is under the most stress is the back. That said, the vast majority of people don't row enough for this to be an issue.

Regardless, it's a bit disingenuous to say something is bad for you with bad form. Isn't everything? I'm sure even swimming with bad form will screw you up. Sure, some exercises are more ""bad form immune"" than others, but even if you hop on something simple like a stationary bike you could mess it up by cranking the resistance too high and hunching over.

One of those things where sure, technically I only have myself to blame but I wouldn't have done it if I knew I'd have to do it alone. 

Do what is best for you, if anyone comes along for the ride that's great but don't count on it."

Libertarian,fmszdly,t3_fx4uw2,1586364387.0,"Lets be clear that any blame on Trump lies solely with the spread of the coronavirus in the US. In addition, it is disingenuous to claim that he could have prevented this because literally every developed nation has suffered from the outbreak. Could it have been mitigated with a better response? Sure. But we'd still be in this economic crisis and there would still be a massive number of deaths and infections.

The media needs to start focusing on the real cause: China and the world's (not the US) failure to take seriously the potential threat that has been looming for the last couple decades. World leaders need to get their act together and do something about China. If they don't we will have another outbreak like this and it could be much worse and more deadly. We need to insist on full cooperation from China on finding the causes of these outbreaks and allowing WHO oversight to eliminate them. The world has huge leverage over China in the form of trade and financial restrictions should they not comply."

dataisbeautiful,fmpaigc,t1_fmny7l1,1586277412.0,It's the lower interest rate that partially causes the price increase. More people get approved for loans means more money floating around to buy homes meaning prices go up. Same reason college tuition increased so much: government loans.

dataisbeautiful,fmp9dwx,t1_fmnpgu3,1586276835.0,"It's more BS because it's wage, not total compensation. You might only make $15/hour but if you get any sort of health insurance from it you're really earning a lot more than that. There is a hidden wage increase that you don't realize because of employer provided health insurance."
dataisbeautiful,fmp8zud,t1_fmnff1r,1586276636.0,"You have to factor in that total pay is dramatically affected by health insurance benefits cost. For example, as a teacher 2 years ago I was earning $70k/year but the district was contributing something like $21k/year to health insurance.

Health insurance cost is something that is the same regardless of the worker. Even if total compensation for all wage levels increased at the same rate, lower paid workers would see a far lower take home pay increase because a much larger proportion of their total pay is from health insurance benefits.

Say health insurance goes from $5k/year in 1990 to $25k/year in 2020.

Total compensation:

Worker A: $250k in 1990 to $500k in 2020 is 100% increase.

Worker B: $25k in 1990 to $50k in 2020 is 100% increase.

Wage:

Worker A: $245k in 1990 to $475k in 2020 is 94% increase.

Worker B: $20k in 1990 to $25k in 2020 is 25% increase.

So what looks like a disproportionate gap in pay increase may not actually be that, because health care benefits throw things off dramatically. After all, from the company's perspective it's total compensation that matters not the wage.

One ""benefit"" of nationalizing health care will be that lower paid workers should see their wages increase dramatically while higher paid workers will see very little increase."
nextfuckinglevel,fmp6vi9,t3_fwi83r,1586275540.0,"Lots of people are saying he should take the $8 million but I think it's totally reasonable for him not to do so:

1) He's the son of a doctor and a ? (probably some other high earning career).

2) He's knows he's going to live a comfortable life with or without $8 million.

3) The $8 million probably isn't as straight forward as we think, it's just a nice big number for the story. It probably came with conditions that were not worthwhile.

4) It would take away the meaning of the work for him. He clearly enjoys programming and he wanted to do something good.

Gloomhaven,fmnl6hp,t1_fmnhpal,1586228636.0,"The Necromancer, Drifter, and Deathwalker all have what I can see as interesting complexity. You get to do something new for that added complexity. The other 3, not so much. It's like they are complex for the sake of complexity but what do you get for that? 

I think my concern is that these are starting classes. Why are the *starting* classes so complex? Is that a sign of how all the classes are going to be? Are the other classes going to get even more complex? If not, why are these the starting classes and not some of the locked ones? The natural progression in a game is simple -> complex. You usually don't start out with the most challenging things and then have it slow down from there. 

I should also add that I have no problem with complexity personally. However, I play this game with other people and the last thing I want is to buy a $100 game then have my gaming group go from 4 people to 2 people. I also don't find the particular way the classes were designed to be appealing. The aren't a ""fun"" complexity in my opinion, except perhaps the Drifter because it was straight-forward to understand yet had some possible depth to the play. Some of the others suffer from the opposite, difficult to understand yet very possibly lacking much depth. Banner Spear could have potential but I think it will end up that the multi-hex attacks are pretty bad in practice (just look at how badly people rate many other melee multi-hex attacks that require no additional setup)."
Gloomhaven,fmnk24a,t1_fmnhabs,1586227881.0,"I'd argue there is a lot of room for design space with basic classes because the original basic classes each have several imperfections and many ""dead"" cards. You can reuse the same mechanics in different combinations and make them work better. 

Mindthief augments - Imagine if they were all equally good.

Summons - Imagine if they weren't so bad in general.

Brute retaliate/shield - Imagine it done without those being so terrible. 

Engineer - Imagine having adding in better functioning support abilities.

Not that they should directly redo those classes (though why not?) but the abilities and mechanics have a lot of room for improvement and tweaking without increasing the complexity. The way Frosthaven is rolling out, I get the sense that the designers have no interest in fixing any of these things and instead limited themselves to building on a cracked foundation. 

Is it really any more interesting to have the same basic attack 4 but only when you're ""fast""? I don't get feel that some of these classes even do anything interesting other than being more complex to play. In other words, the output is the same as boring old move/attack but the requirements from the player are more convoluted."
Gloomhaven,fmn1s4u,t1_fmmudcz,1586216410.0,"Is there though? After all, Frosthaven is more of the same as that. It's got extra rules and complexity but essentially it's just Gloomhaven.

Releasing Frosthaven is a bit like releasing a new edition of DnD. A lot of familiar stuff with some cool changes. Old players will buy it for the cool new stuff. New players will buy it because it's the latest. Except imagine if instead of making new and interesting rules and classes and spells and such, they made those new rules twice as complex. It would turn off a significant number of fans and not really attract any new ones.

Now that's the designer's choice of course but I can tell from the starting classes that it will not be a top 10 game like Gloomhaven. It won't sell nearly as many copies. On the other hand, something like JotL has potential upside as it might hit a large segment of gamers who want something a little less involved. 

Was there a huge demand on the forums or something I missed where people were complaining that Gloomhaven was too simplistic in its gameplay? I can't remember seeing even a single post with such a sentiment."
Gloomhaven,fmipay8,t3_ftov9i,1586114159.0,"Honestly, this is already the worst experience I've ever had with a computer game. I bought the 4-pack on sale, great. I downloaded Steam and start the client. Everything except the menu's is black. I go into big screen mode so I can see some things now and start installing the game. But how do I find my other 3 copies? After a google search, I find them. Then I try to add my friends as friends. After clicking literally every button and menu in big screen mode, I have to go back to the normal mode (where everything is black/blank) to use the friend menu. But oh wait, my account is limited and I'm not allowed to have friends. 

Why do people continue using this broken product (Steam)? It's like the worst form of gaming malware."

I'm currently rowing about 70k a week. 4 workouts of 3x5k 3m rest and two workouts of 6k after a deadlifting session. All in the same HR zone as at the moment I'm trying to get to 1 million season meters before the end of April. I plan to mix it up a bit after that."
