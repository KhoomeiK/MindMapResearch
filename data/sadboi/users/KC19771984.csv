Epilepsy,fr47v6i,t1_fr3s3b8,1589878934.0,"Yes, that‚Äôs so right. When he went for his MRI, I mentioned the head injury and the doctor said it probably wasn‚Äôt but then I read online exactly what you said - he could have been susceptible anyway. No one in either family has epilepsy but doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt a susceptibility there. I know you‚Äôre right - I definitely try to focus on the positives and not think or worry about what has caused it - I know there‚Äôs no point but I suppose it will always be there in my mind. This sub has been invaluable for advice as epilepsy has always terrified me - and it has definitely made me more optimistic for the future. Thank you so much for your advice and taking the time to respond. It means a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
80s,fr0k3a6,t1_fr0dkaq,1589798461.0,Nice! That sounds even cooler!
ptsd,fr0jxab,t3_glwwd3,1589798298.0,She is very lucky to have you. Wanting to give help and support and to understand is the most important thing - many people don‚Äôt make the effort either because they are too afraid to hear the details or worried they won‚Äôt no what to do. Reassure her that you are there and want to help no matter what and want to understand. Don‚Äôt push her on details. If she feels comfortable with you and feels support she is much more likely to open up. Good luck - you sound like an amazing guy and I hope your girlfriend is okay.
Epilepsy,fr02gmk,t1_fqzdy0g,1589781788.0,This is heartbreaking. I am so sorry for your loss.
Epilepsy,fr02f66,t1_fqzcda9,1589781754.0,"Thank you for this - it‚Äôs great advice to have from someone in a similar situation. He does try to sleep on his stomach constantly and I‚Äôm always trying to encourage him onto his side, but, as you say, he is young and maybe when he is older he will be able to train himself to do that, as you did. He can‚Äôt go to share a room with his brother anyway (his brother has severe autism and a learning disability and it‚Äôs been deemed too dangerous for them to share) so he has to remain in with me until we sort housing with his own room but no-video monitor definitely seems a sensible way forward. I know you are right about not monitoring him too much (I am the worst for this - I blame myself for his epilepsy as he had a head injury just before he turned three - slipped and split his head open And needed a couple of stitches in the back of his head, while I was trying to deal with his brother) but yes, I can see why you would do that if you were tired of your parents freaking out. I‚Äôd probably have done the same myself in your position! I hope your seizures remain controlled and that your son is okay, too. Xx"

You can‚Äôt help the way you have been affected and people who say, ‚Äúoh, it could have been worse‚Äù are ignorant at best or, at worse, just assholes who you would be better just flat out ignoring.
