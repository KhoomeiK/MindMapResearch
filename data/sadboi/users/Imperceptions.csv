newbrunswickcanada,fqdqsqn,t1_fq1x259,1589294961.0,"I have never seen something more elitist than the idea that because I go to AU, I'm not educated. First of all, that completely ignores the efforts I've put in (over half my degree on brick and mortar), and second, I think you should consider the type of people who might *HAVE* to turn to AU before you continue. I hate the discussion of privilege, but this is definitely a case of it.

Not everybody can afford to take off 8-9 months a year to focus on their education. Not everybody can manage to work and go to school at once.

Some people, this in particular is my situation, have a mental or neurological illness that made on-campus classes either impossible, or nearly torture.

So, basically, your insinuation that I'm wasting my time because I'm not focusing on traditional methods is beyond insulting. My degree is less valuable because I did it online? Because I pushed to learn on my own? Are academic journals ""different"" for online schools? No, not really. After-all, I frequently swap back to my old STU login because I happen to like their layout better (even for the same resources). 

Education is more than just paying for fancy well-maintained lawns and sports teams."
newbrunswickcanada,fqdpw2u,t1_fqd0mr0,1589294501.0,"You're discrediting an entire method of teaching because it doesn't fit in with your life, and I'm the one who is closed-minded? Yeesh. Both methods have pros and cons, and blindly hating on either one severely lacks perspective."
newbrunswickcanada,fqdpoyh,t1_fqbe3j4,1589294397.0,"The difference is also that these classes that are being hastily set up during COVID-19 were never designed for e-learning, an entirely different experience. As for education, online can be pretty tough, but there are a fair share of in-person classes where the professor is actually making the class worse. I had a lot of problems with that in the English department at STU. As I tried to explain, I've done both extensive online and in person classes.

For students who need labs, then absolutely do not consider online as a first option, but in many cases (Social sciences especially), the online experience can have a really guided focus. It's also up to the student to engage - use forums, reach out. Nothing is handed to you like classmates in person. For some this breaks the learning, and I get that. For me, I find so much time is saved (and better utilized) because I don't listen to my classmates ask 1000 questions and replace valuable learning time of other students. I did enjoy in-class discussions, but let's not kid ourselves that *all* of it is valuable.

There are pros and cons to both methods, but I really dislike people like the above (not you) who dump on online education as a whole, snobbishly considering any alternative to what they know as lacking value."
