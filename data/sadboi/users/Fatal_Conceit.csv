No. Is it good for joining tables and multiple sources into single visuals (blending) - no but it’ll get the job done in some cases. If your team can’t clean data with sql I’m a data warehouse it’ll never really be clean. And just kinda spoiler alert. Data is never really that clean. We like google ads data into big query for a data warehouse so we can clean and put it together and there’s about 80 views, tables, and partition tables to manipulate into getting the right data.
