abuse,fnfswr9,t1_fnfsi0q,1586914779.0,I think your parents would be super mad but they would want to protect you in this once they've calmed down. Maybe consider talking to them about it? They love you more than anymore in this world

What exactly is your biggest fear of it all? Fear of what people would think, fear of losing what?

I do think you need to contact a support group ASAP"
abuse,fnfplq8,t1_fnfnsi4,1586912818.0,"Totally agree.
Have you spoken to anyone about this? My only regret (23f now, verbal always been present but physical started when I was 11-12 I think, not quite sure) is not telling someone when I was younger. I was so afraid of being taken away. While the reality of it all would have maybe led my parents taking a step back and realising they would lose me and if not then maybe we would have been better off without them. Either way they didn't lose me as a kid but I know they will lose me as an adult once I'm done college if their behavior doesn't change. My hope is to love them from a distance. 
I'd advice you to focus your energy on something productive. My choice was school and study. I want to succeed so I don't turn into my parents. Bitter and low self worth. Its seems a lot of the time that's why abusers do what they do. There is something eating them inside."

Contact a domestic abuse agency in your area. There are usually 24 hour ones. They can offer you some advice.

abuse,fnfmhyi,t3_g1c3vr,1586911004.0,"Your story hits me hard

Childhood plays a big part in forming us but you can deprogram how you look at things and decide to work on being better than does abusive people.

I'd recommend going onto YouTube and watching Ted Talks. There are some amazing perspectives and they can opens up a lot of thoughts u may have. 

Have you tried counselling? It has helps me significantly. 

Another thing I do is tune into the reddit responses on these types of posts. It also helps"
traumaticchildhood,fmd6j75,t1_fll705o,1585960426.0,"Im really bad at being on reddit. But I want to thank you so much for your response. It's lovely to hear your story and know that one day I may be able to make peace. I really am working in counselling to be able to get to that silver lining. 
I acknowledge that this part of life has shaped me in bad ways but also very good ways. I will not let this cycle of abuse continue to my future kids. 
Back living at home now for the first time in so long (college closed because of the virus) . The verbal abuse is pretty bad, no physical thankfully. I feel like I can't wait to get some space from this house. I've always had this feeling of running away. Being back in this house brings up a lot of trauma, brings it back.
Did you work through counselling? I really just know if I did a letter they would just make fun of it and call me every bad name possibly. I think it would cause a lot of uproar. My siblings have recently started to talk about the abuse with me and empathise. I think it's because I'm so close to finishing college (2 months) & they fear I'm gonna run off and not talk to any of them.
Apart from the letter did you do anything else?"

I can understand this grief. I got a phone call on Christmas day 2018 that one of my best friends had committed suicide the night before.
Christmas 2019 was very difficult, the numb pain still returns. 
I hope you and your family find strength. Are you doing family therapy? You should make sure you are seeing a psychotherapist even alone, it really helped our group of friends.

relationship_advice,fh174yi,t1_fgr7tvn,1581211546.0,Thank you. I don't like to talk about it with anyone. In my previous relationship I found that once I told him about it - it was literally all he thought about and he would get sad too & want to help me by talking it out. Which I hated. I don't want pity. I just want to live a happier life. I just want to ignore it ever happened

What I'm thinking is: I wait until after he meets my parents (long time away yet), that way he can form his own opinion about them himself. But then again I'm thinking if I leave it that long he might not trust me.
I don't know tho.. Kind of all too much."

 I've suppressed quite a lot of memories from that time and I've always hope they would eventually just fade away into the back of my mind. 
I'm just afraid it will push him away & not want to get involved with me. I guess I don't want to be abandoned again. I feel physically sick and want to run away when be asks me about my mental health as I have told him I see a counsellor regularly. I find myself getting anxious and slightly defensive. I guess the conversation may need to be said but I don't want him to think I'm broken and can't be fixed."
