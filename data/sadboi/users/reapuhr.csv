nfl,fdjbf7v,t1_fdhlrtv,1578464184.0,That is terrible. I live in Kansas City and did not know this. Why the hell does he do that?
nfl,f8wlz2i,t1_f8w4q22,1574893907.0,Pretty fucking much.
nfl,f8nfc7t,t1_f8nexni,1574642871.0,"Totally agreed. In fact, you referenced one earlier.. marijuana, I mean come on. The opiate use is fine with them. Yet, they wont allow players to use something less addictive and that less/little to no side effects. 

They just want their money."
nfl,f8na0cq,t1_f8n9pb7,1574640939.0,"You're right, but they have to really want to. And they'll definitely be doing that."
nfl,f8mz5eg,t1_f8myvj1,1574637074.0,"Those last two sentences are spot on. And yeah.. I know, but I wouldnt feel bad for him. I also think people that do stuff like that wont learn anyway."
nfl,f8mm7mr,t1_f8lo5y9,1574632658.0,"Completely agreed. Though, not even because I'm a Broncos fan, I would not feel bad for Tyreek Hill getting hurt. I think that's what is called.... karma..?"

DenverBroncos,f6h3flh,t3_dr9mjw,1572836121.0,Oh my god it was terrible.
DenverBroncos,f6h39b4,t3_dr9moq,1572836005.0,He did do well this week. I liked the difference in attitude and hustle too.
DenverBroncos,f5rtotn,t1_f5rthng,1572402766.0,"I can catch and got speed, I'm only 5'8 though.. but obviously it was a joke."
DenverBroncos,f5rswit,t3_dotybb,1572402208.0,But drafting new talent at the position he played has been way off. And the first one I'm confident with in awhile is still on IR. I guess we will see.
DenverBroncos,f5rr37n,t3_doti8k,1572400929.0,Bet he balls out.
DenverBroncos,f5rqzvz,t3_doti8k,1572400867.0,PUT LOCK IN
DenverBroncos,f5rqwyh,t3_doptlm,1572400811.0,"Lock is so ready to play. He would bring so much fire. And we need that. Plus with all that has gone wrong, I think that may have improved his awareness/recklessness."
DenverBroncos,f5rqp1w,t1_f5q1e5c,1572400669.0,Hes ready. You can tell. I would be pissed too.
DenverBroncos,f5rqmp0,t3_dotb0o,1572400626.0,Put this kid in.
DenverBroncos,f5rqjr8,t1_f5r3tvn,1572400574.0,You're a legend my dude.
DenverBroncos,f5rqif0,t1_f5rinlo,1572400552.0,Agreed
DenverBroncos,f5rqfby,t3_dowedc,1572400498.0,I do this for less money and its physical labor. Let me in the NFL... please?
minnesotavikings,f5ojvkk,t1_f5o14ks,1572320235.0,"Yeah, Brady and Peyton."
nfl,f5ojksk,t3_dofuxy,1572319978.0,This guy is absolutely crazy talented.
LosAngelesRams,f5jqty9,t3_dnuycs,1572237046.0,We can take him back
DenverBroncos,f5jocvy,t1_f5jiu6o,1572234462.0,I feel the same. Sutton is a baller.

opiates,f45e833,t3_djcwrj,1571373723.0,I'm so glad to see that others feel this way.
G59,f45e4s8,t3_dj5fjf,1571373629.0,We ready.
DenverBroncos,f458awj,t1_f458552,1571368630.0,I'll give you that.
DenverBroncos,f457x1t,t3_djepul,1571368336.0,Any of us still watching are masochists.
DenverBroncos,f456ume,t1_f456eaj,1571367536.0,And Chris
DenverBroncos,f456tnt,t1_f456eh6,1571367517.0,Besides our defense... or Sutton.. or Lindsay.. they all give a fuck and still try
DenverBroncos,f456pzk,t1_f456ez2,1571367441.0,"Yeah, Lock has the attitude to win. I dont give a fuck about Flacco being a ""veteran"". Sometimes that young confident kid with some fucking energy is better."
DenverBroncos,f4520ym,t1_f451if5,1571364122.0,Agreed.
DenverBroncos,f451h8z,t1_f450ghi,1571363725.0,That was the game changer. Not the failed 2 point
nfl,f3wgm4e,t1_f3wgh14,1571201752.0,Exactly and with Ramsey's attitude.. man.. 2 years of not being in the first 32 picks.. ehhhh rough
DenverBroncos,f3wgkb5,t1_f3vw4uv,1571201699.0,This. The value is insane on that trade. Two years of first rounders? Nope. Ramsey is amazing. But I dont think I would ever want us to trade two first rounders for anyone. Jaguars won this.
DenverBroncos,f3wgg4d,t3_di9fmh,1571201575.0,"With the value Ramsey just got, if we trade away Chris.. I dont think it's a good move. Draft picks are valuable, despite Chris getting older."
DenverBroncos,f3wgdzr,t1_f3w3btn,1571201514.0,Pleaseeeeeee let this happen.
DenverBroncos,f3wgcu5,t1_f3u5txd,1571201480.0,This seems incredibly likely.
nfl,f3wg3ns,t1_f3wfu7x,1571201214.0,"Either way, I'm stunned and jealous. I miss the Talib/Harris days. But at the same time, I wouldnt wanna give away that value for Ramsey. Yeah, hes a star, amazing athlete. But attitude issues and using two first rounders? What happens if Talib slows down? You may want another corner in the future soon. Kind of alot of value, even if he is young. There is other factors.."
nfl,f3wfk0j,t1_f3wfger,1571200660.0,I am aware. I didnt portray my sarcasm on mobile enough. I apologize.
nfl,f3wfi6i,t3_dignk0,1571200609.0,"Ramsey is amazing, but two first rounders back to back? That could really cost you as a franchise. I think with Ramseys attitude issues.. the Jaguars got the WAY better deal in my opinion."
nfl,f3wfdt4,t1_f3vrruq,1571200487.0,I think you mean.. upgrade.. Talib and Ramsey.. what..
DenverBroncos,f39mdl4,t1_f39m1tl,1570751255.0,"Aye thanks man, much appreciated."
DenverBroncos,f39gx8r,t3_dfzpz3,1570748000.0,Wow. I have the same birthday as him. I guess I know what jersey I want next.
nfl,f35klxj,t3_dfj0br,1570680489.0,Great guy
fantasyfootball,f353n2u,t1_f33fonx,1570667599.0,Couldn't be anyone else.
DenverBroncos,f2u5fme,t1_f2u50y8,1570407819.0,"Yeah, we wont have that right now. But.."
DenverBroncos,f2u3s01,t1_f2u3qj8,1570406571.0,I completely agree.
DenverBroncos,f2u2flh,t1_f2tzs7r,1570405619.0,"I laughed when he did. Also love his comments on Fangio towards the end of the game. I feel like good things are to come, even if not this season. 

Let's all remember. Romo is like the NFL fortune teller."
DenverBroncos,f2u2c1t,t1_f2u0gx1,1570405551.0,It's a good day!
DenverBroncos,f2u29ym,t1_f2u1vjn,1570405510.0,He's good. I would prefer to have PFM several years ago though still.
DenverBroncos,f2u26ss,t1_f2u2379,1570405443.0,"I feel the same, Johnson has the game. I really think he can be a great player."
DenverBroncos,f2u258n,t3_deazvc,1570405411.0,I WILL TAKE IT. HELL YES. FUCK YEAH.
DenverBroncos,f2u22ux,t3_dcefop,1570405362.0,ILL FUCKIN TAKE IT. FUCKING YES.
nfl,f2ts68w,t1_f2seqja,1570399671.0,Kind of like his dad.

DenverBroncos,f29v8ip,t1_f291428,1570104683.0,Yep. My mistake
blackjack,f28t299,t1_f24ok50,1570069980.0,This. My apologies for the wording.
DenverBroncos,f28qung,t1_f273v7s,1570068459.0,Josh Herbert...?
blackjack,f22rwdk,t3_dbltuk,1569895534.0,"Same damn thing happened to me before on 250 a hand.. absolutely terrible.

Edit: Split once, and double on both, so lost 750."
blackjack,f2215e8,t1_f210jy3,1569879816.0,Yeah it does. I did it in Vegas and I left afterwards immediately. Seemed to definitely raise flags.
logodesign,f1ftefh,t3_d95i9e,1569452581.0,Logo would entice me to go.
SuicideWatch,f1fo0hz,t3_d92gf2,1569448778.0,I would love this as well.
streetwearstartup,f1ajwvt,t3_d8dx2g,1569296117.0,Very nice damn
DenverBroncos,f0uu1lw,t1_f0utyae,1568950765.0,"Yeah I would. Especially if I was on TV officiating a sport with an audience the size of the NFL.

I hate my fucking job I currently have. But it's what I have for right now so."
DenverBroncos,f0uhoyo,t1_f0u6hh4,1568941052.0,"Agreed. But also, why not just take it seriously? I mean, you're officiating a NFL game."
DenverBroncos,f0uhkcp,t3_d6kf11,1568940956.0,Give us the win then.
DenverBroncos,ezv8v4m,t3_d2jep4,1568170315.0,The front says Coors Light Denver Football with bluecifer under the text.
DenverBroncos,ezv8lbd,t1_ezssnzg,1568170098.0,Was not aware of there were two guards out. I did know of one and the corner though.
DenverBroncos,ezsj2rp,t1_ezsizon,1568093508.0,"I'm aware that he was. But need more depth there. Allow for Jackson to be more versatile as well. No not a starter corner, but better and more depth. Maybe a dumb idea, oh well I stand by it."
DenverBroncos,ezsiycc,t1_ezsivoy,1568093371.0,"Jewell didnt do bad man. Davis is average in my opinion, yeah we missed him. I was saying Callahan is coming back, but solidifying the secondary is more important in depth. Just an opinion for our situation."
DenverBroncos,ezsip7z,t3_d231na,1568093094.0,"Trade Davis, for a better corner. Jewell looks good and we have thr talent there in linebacker"
DenverBroncos,ezsihle,t1_ezshvt6,1568092863.0,"I was disappointed with alot of comments too about how the season is over. I think we will turn it around. Callahan and Davis will be back. I think we let Callahan sit to not bother his foot more because we underestimated the Raiders with AB gone and such. And Davis will recover, when two of our starters are back. We won't have receivers burning.. Yiadom."
DenverBroncos,ezsibqw,t1_ezshvxk,1568092686.0,Same...same..
DenverBroncos,ezsib70,t3_d231na,1568092670.0,"Can we all remember that Davis and Callahan were out? We cant act like that had no play in this outcome. However, it does not explain the offenses issues."
DenverBroncos,ezsi60w,t1_ezshxgd,1568092516.0,"Yeah. His play at the beginning especially really set the tone. Continued to play bad. Man this was disappointing. If Callahan had played. I think we would have won, honestly.

Edit: I am not saying there was other aspects that were bad, but Callahan would have prevented a lot of what Yiadom couldn't. Also not blaming this loss on one player being injured."
DenverBroncos,ezsi23c,t1_ezshzc6,1568092402.0,Exactly what I am doing.
DenverBroncos,ezsi1a4,t1_ezshzek,1568092378.0,We all do.. we all do..
DenverBroncos,ezshyyp,t3_d212vk,1568092312.0,Well.. let's see how the rest of the season goes.
DenverBroncos,ezshtg0,t3_d212vk,1568092156.0,I had hope man.
DenverBroncos,ezsht54,t3_d212vk,1568092148.0,Man...
DenverBroncos,ezshs95,t1_ezshlt3,1568092123.0,Watch. Lindsay is about to get a crazy touchdown. Saving his legs for clutch time.
DenverBroncos,ezshqe0,t1_ezshlwv,1568092070.0,If I could give you gold I would. This is fantastic. Where the fuck have they been!?
DenverBroncos,ezshngx,t3_d212vk,1568091990.0,FUCK FORCING A 4TH DOWN AND A PUNT. GET A TURN OVER. SCORE IMMEDIATELY.

DenverBroncos,ezshaje,t3_d212vk,1568091619.0,Couldn't have had offense like this before?
DenverBroncos,ezsh5cn,t1_ezsgzrd,1568091474.0,"right? Dont get why people giving up right away. We under estimated them, clearly. Callahan didnt play, Yiadom gave up so much early to get us behind 7, doubt that would have happened with Callahan. It's the first game, yeah division loss would suck. But let's be optimistic"
DenverBroncos,ezsh005,t3_d212vk,1568091326.0,atleast it wasnt a touchdown...?
DenverBroncos,ezsgw9j,t3_d212vk,1568091219.0,Did Fangio really have that face just now...
