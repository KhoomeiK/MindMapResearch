AskReddit,flfmuin,t3_fok2vm,1585110928.0,"I accidentally overdosed on cymbalta due to me getting it confused with another pill that I was taking at the time. So at the ER I had to drink charcoal. They told me that I would have the mother of all bowel movements but I was not prepared when it happened. I didn't just shit out what seemed like 5 pounds of shit at the speed of light, what I shit out looked like it came straight from a tar pit. It was pitch black explosive diarrhea that actually stained our toilet a light black for a couple of days. It was not fun or pretty. I'll never forget looking in the toilet and seeing black EVERYWHERE. Like I have birth to an alien.

This Vaped bud is all from Oklahoma dispensaries. 95% of it was vaped with a Pax 3 and the other 5% with a Dynavap M. 

It's primarily straight flower but there are a couple of moon rocks and some kief that I Vaped mixed in. 

So the ultimate question is What should I do with it? I've smoked avb and it's definitely shit tasting but does have a nice body high. My only concern with smoking it is that it might take 3 blunts to get me high due to my tolerance. And that doesn't sound like something I wanna do unless I'm desperately needing to get high.  So I'm wondering if maybe going the route of edibles would be a good route? If so? Major suggestions needed cause avb definitely is the best tasting. 

So what does everyone think?"
