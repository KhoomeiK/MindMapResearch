How is the union going to support us so we aren't understaffed? You need physical bodies to be properly staffed. My store manager is on the floor so she would be considered to be part of this worker's union even though she is also considered management? If your baristas are not properly trained then that is an issue with your trainer.

I have not known Starbucks to just promote baristas. Like many retail jobs you don't just get promoted, you apply for it.

**EVERY** survey shows unionized workers are happy? You're gonna have to provide those surveys for me to 100 percent believe that.

I get where you are coming from, and I'm not saying unions are a bad thing, I'm saying it might not be the solution for us. If we want things like a livable wage then we need to vote during election time, and support people that will fight for issues like such."
starbucksbaristas,fpvsh21,t1_fpvobqb,1588951015.0,"How much would union dues be? When would we pay them? Weekly? Monthly? Say it's 200 a month, would that mean a smaller store with 10 employees has to pay more than a store with 20? Would we all be members of said union where our votes count, or just represented by a union? What if not employees feel the same way about a union, what happens then? 

A union would create a ""us vs. them"" mentality. So, who is ""us?"" The barista and shifts? Do we include our store managers even though they are considered management?

If we get higher pay, would our prices have to increase to match that pay? How would customers feel about that? What if we demand such high wages that we have to fire people? Or stop hiring people? Would that create staffing issues at your store?

What if you start to disagree with what your union is doing? When it comes to promotions or layoffs what do you envision happening? What happens to the individuality that it seems a lot of Starbucks employees enjoy? How will seniority come into play? What if you're a great worker that gets passed up on a promotion to shift to someone else just because they've been with Sbux longer?

A big appeal of unions are the benefits, what benefits of a union do you think we don't already have? PT employees get health insurance, sick time, vacation time etc. But right now it seems like you just want higher wages, understandable, and the feeling of not being forced to work during a pandemic, also understandable. But it doesn't seem like a union is needed for that."
