My motivation currently is tied heavily to having to go to class and interact with people and the professor, plus I like to ask questions and meet with my professors, so this motivation is just fine and I’m doing work just to get a grade and it’s not how I’m trying to do school.

This is because I haven’t stopped tripping tho (and I don’t plan to) I just take it all in stride ig.

shrooms,fm7ewkr,t1_fm7ed8p,1585824417.0,"Lol, the mushrooms have a massive, conscious, mycelial net which extends across the earth, effectively making a brain, which I can communicate with at any time. Also Becoming aware of myself as a whole and the massive amounts of entities which are always around us at all times, just outside of the visible light spectrum, blew my mind to pieces lol. Regardless, I could sit here and try to explain for hours and you still would probably not understand because of the need to be rational. Nothing actually exists and no one actually knows what’s going on, rationality can only take you so far. 

And as far as astrology goes, everything is energy, the universe is like a massive clock, the imprint of the whole universe is placed into at the moment of your birth, and along with karma from past lives, makes up the base that you are, everything else is formed as the ego is formed. It’s just massively ignorant to denounce astrology as not rational. The energy of the planets closet to us, and those in other star systems to a varying degree, all play a part in our personalities, life events, and day to day lives. Nothing is by accident, you placed yourself into this word at the exact moment you were born so you could be you, just like everyone else. 

Idk if I explained that well but everyone is awakening currently, So you’ll understand soon enough"

Or
B. The mushrooms talk to me
And I’ll always go with the latter :)

shrooms,fm74wzr,t1_fm74ccn,1585813377.0,"You should be okay tbh, weed is a real psyche for me now and I caused panic attack sometimes but I just deal with it for some reason. Shrooms don’t really give me anxiety at all, except for when it’s really really intense I guess but Even then it’s more like wtf wtf wtf, I’ve had a full blown panic attack on acid (due to weed lol) but I mix mushrooms and weed all the time and I’m chillin. Lol that wasn’t your question tho. 

I’d say get a scale and weigh out like half a gram just to start since your worried about what will happen and work your way up from there by like half a gram every time. Around an eighth is a standard dose to get you trippin hard and really into a great headspace. But work your way up to it. If you feel comfortable at half a gram then probably up the dose by a bit more if you want(you might not even feel it too much it really depends on the strength of the mushrooms that you have). Always remember that the Mushrooms will never give you more than you can handle, unless you take a large dose with no planning or anything lol, and even then, you’ll probably come out okay. 

Always be in a safe setting where your comfortable (to start with at least),start off with low doses so you can get somewhat comfortable with it, and always remember that you’ve taken a drug and it will all end eventually (if your having a bad trip) oh and have a trip sitter with you, just to chill with you and make sure it turns out okay 

And last but not least, DO ALOT OF RESEARCH, before you take anything in general lol, find out the potential effects, good and bad, and everything in between

Soulnexus,fjj7pbf,t3_fdn844,1583385734.0,"I don’t think it’s warranted at all in this massive shift we are going through, if your time is meant to end it will happen naturally. My body basically reacts to everything and I have all the food allergies. I’m on some meds rn that help but if I even wait an hour to take it, I get itchy, and without meds I just fall into my own personal hell as my skin basically molts off. Tbh I’m v aware that this massive reaction that happens if I don’t take medications just gets worse the longer I prolong letting the reaction takes it’s full course,allowing my body to fully cleanse itself because my skin is reacting to toxins which are being released from every inch of my body when the medications stop suppressing my immune system and it goes into overdrive trying to fix me. I’ve been at a point so many times where I wanted to kill myself and seriously considered it but once I found out who I AM, I gained this deep peace about it and that I AM the one who put myself into this condition before my life and now I have to get myself out, almost as a miracle of sorts, but it’s really just the body doing what it does naturally. I could be very wrong but it seems all these chronic illnesses are massive overreactions from the body because it’s very full of toxins and the external/internal reactions (without suppression) are hell but in the end serve a purpose. Only through massive destruction can the true self be reborn, On both a mental and a physical level. I haven’t even started doing this myself but switching to a plant based diet and then eventually fasting for a a few days to a week after a juice cleanse to fully release the toxins and let my immune system reset itself. Lol hopefully some of this helps but really, YOU put yourself in this situation before you were born and you know within yourself that you can get out of it, doctors treat symptoms, prolonging the illness and making getting out of it worse. You can do this, the suffering will end, have faith in the creator and in yourself that you know what your doing, despite what your ego thinks. Oh and listen to your own body, it might sound weird but just feel what it’s telling you. Our bodies are these highly advanced biological machines that carry out an infinite number of tasks every second to keep you breathing and blood flowing through your veins and yet we don’t even have to think about it or frankly even come to an awareness of it. Listen to yourself and it will all become clear. Chronic illness are fucking bullshit but we can get through them, just like anything else!!!

The age of Pisces is marked by the conscious self being ruled by the unconscious, both personal and in the world as a whole, think big business and dark money and the rosthschilds running things in the background while the general populous mills about, but the age of Aquarius is marked by the subconscious being ruled by the conscious, so the ego becoming aware and merging with its true self, and the world as a whole being placed into our hands
