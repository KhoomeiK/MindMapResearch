Anxiety,flhey0a,t1_flh8fcz,1585161379.0,"Sorry I don't think that's a ""kink"" problem like it's a whole big ass thing here and I'm not really ""kinky"" about it. But yeah thx anyway"
Anxiety,flh7fbu,t1_flh5qqp,1585157467.0,"My therapist told me the same thing yeah.  Hope I will move on at my pace, thank you for sharing your experience!"
Anxiety,flh6c08,t1_flh51jj,1585156898.0,"I understand what you are saying but once again all this rarely happen (masturbating over those things). And Yeah I will try your thing to slowly move on instead of jumping right into another thing. I'm really exausted.   
I know I'm not a weird pervert or a pedophile or whatever. But clearly I have issues to work on.   


And I can't really tel myself ""i like when kids are innocent and have sexual plaisure"" because it's making me inconfortable, it's not true.   
But I will try to move my thoughts slowly every time it comes thank you.   


Are you a psychologist ?"
Anxiety,flh4uy2,t1_flh3f3g,1585156122.0,"That's what I trying to tell myself but...Yeah I still feel ashamed? And guilty, I feel bad for not having fought hard enough ? But on the other hand it kind of woke me up, the last experience was really bad for my self esteem and made me really feel like shit. It's kind of ok now, but yeah the guilt.
I don't want to go off looking at kids having this kind of pleasure it's horrible I don't want that! It's freaking me out. 

I don't know?  Young! Like... 8 ? 9? 

No I can't really remember. I know my mother tend to touch me saying that my intimacy belonged to her, it was not sexual I think? It presented itself as a game. 
I don't have many memories of the time I was 8 or 9 sorry."
Anxiety,flgawv4,t1_flerdpf,1585137375.0,"I'm not suppressing my sex life, I'm really trying to replace mental kinks with different kinks that made me feel at ease and good about myself. It's all mental things after all.I want to be a good person and I have strong moral values, like one of them is always protecting others, protecting the weakest ones, being just, and faire, never judge without knowing, be good to everyone even those who don't deserve it...So yeah my brain is against all of this but me I'm fighting for it!

I feel kind of good now I'm starting to forgive myself and move on and accept the weird thoughts that come and go sometimes, they do not always please me but I'm starting to accept they are not mine they are just thoughts that can't do anything in real life. Everybody have odd thoughts I guess my anxiety made this more difficult for me to deal with them?

I'm starting to learn how to say ""no"" to people and myself and how to have a better life.

But it's not always sunny!  


Edit: I just realised will re reading your answer I'm not kinky about children being rape or things like that omg"
Anxiety,flgalbr,t1_fleujym,1585137060.0,"hum I don't really know? Not long ago it happenned again, it took me by surprise, I was just going out of anxiety crisis because I've heard the story of a mother masturbating her baby and found it horrible then my brain told me ""yeah but could YOU do it? Or resist do it? What would stop you?"" and I was like ""I would never do that wtf ?""  


And when this crises seemed to calm down I started masturbating over a kinky image of a witch (nothing weird) and then images of kids having plaisure poped into my mental scenario and I didn't want them, but after a while I just shut myself out. It was not the kid that triggered the plaisure part it was just they having sexual plaisure in an innocent way it could have been adult aswell but guess my brain decided that at the moment so I shut up and wake up few secondes later and feelt like shit ?   


I don't know if that answer your question ?"
Anxiety,fleu7xf,t1_fleqbbp,1585091632.0,"It happens mostly when I'm already stressed out. When I'm not feeling good or when I'm masturbating not because I want but because ""well body is claiming"" or something like that ? In summary: When I'm not completly at ease."
Anxiety,fle6evw,t3_fo6h6w,1585078460.0,"I feel my face burning at times, my hands are cold and feel so weak but then I understand I'm not sick it's the way my anxiety manifest. So yeah I feel you buddy!"
