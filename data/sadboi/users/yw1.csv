CPTSD,flflbrt,t3_fohp0p,1585109667.0,"So normal to feel that way.  Trauma changes how your brain works, and it makes it much harder to get through the day.   

I had good luck with just starting small and just focusing on those joys.  Really notice those small moments of happiness- for example, I love drinking coffee in bed in the morning, so I treat myself to nice coffee and make it a point to give myself that time.  Try something new, like gardening, art, a craft, a new class.  Spend time researching and learning about it.  It helps focus your energy away from the weight of the trauma, almost like a distraction.  Decorate your home the way you want, with things you like, and that make you happy to look at them (I like using crystals for this).  I found that taking small steps and really focusing on what makes me happy helped me appreciate it more and focus on that vs trauma/anger/sadness, and helped with the irritability and other symptoms."

Make sure to keep food you like around.  Doesn’t have to be all that good for you.  My angel of a best friend sent me a box of carb-rich, easy to make foods and a bunch of just junk food- sweets, chips, good variety of things.  That way, if I didn’t hate the thought of something, it was available.  It was also more palatable on a queasy stomach.

Drink your calories if that’s easier- make smoothies, shakes, whatever you want.  I didn’t do this but sometimes all the calories I would get for the day would be from a vanilla latte and maybe a granola bar.  Nutritious is best, but it’s whatever works for you.  

Go out in groups at mealtimes- do you have friends, family nearby?  Sometimes it’s easier to eat when you’re having a conversation, takes your mind off the nausea.  My sister used to make me go to breakfast with her and my niece- even if I didn’t eat much, I would have good leftovers for later. 

Ask your doctor about antinausea meds as well- those are amazing until you recover enough for the constant nausea to go away."

antiMLM,etdll5t,t1_etccx5x,1562709377.0,"Yes.  Clients who use the “sensitive” line have skin that feels like it has a “coating” on it.  It’s almost waxy?  They are also still super red.  The problem is usually telangiectasia or rosacea.  Nothing in that line addresses that.  They would get better results with using certain drugstore products.  

Clients who use Mary Kay tend to have very red, irritated, aging and sensitive skin if they use this “microdermabrasion” scrub.  The consultants recommend daily use.  It’s much too aggressive on aging skin and it just obliterates the top layer.  It requires multiple treatments and a good home care routine.
