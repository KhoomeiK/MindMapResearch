When you wake up there was no sense of time in that state. So if it's really like that I wouldn't mind it in the least, you wouldn't know you were dead, just like you didn't know of consciousness till you were born."
depression,ezvxe8t,t3_d2iqh2,1568201209.0,"I've been suffering from crippling depression as far as I can remember, I don't know what it feels like to be happy anymore. It's like an stranger I walked by years ago. One thing I've noticed is there's one or the other thing we all are good at, even if it doesn't feel like it. When i started singing this for started lifting I could finally breathe again, I didn't feel like a walking dead. I feel like it's easier for us who have absolutely hit rock bottom. It's like the thing that will get you out of this state will be so apparent, it's like sitting in a dark room and a spotlight being shined to light up your world. People who aren't where we are, like sitting in a room already lit up.  It'll be harder to see the light, like trying to see a flashlight in the day time. So just do random things, some will flicker some will be dim, but there will be something that will outshine everything. There's no way you'll miss it. I apologize for the long post and I don't think it probably got across what I was trying to say, but if it some home helps someone to get out of the abyss, it's worth a try."

Long term : there's no long term plan of there's no other human to mate with to create more of us. Therefore might aswell kill yourself."
