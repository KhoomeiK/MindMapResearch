therapy,fqw34c3,t1_fqw2u23,1589691513.0,"I've tried different approaches from therapists, including CBT, and even gone so far as on the first session telling them exactly what I wanted out of them and telling them this problem - and they would still just agree and act like they wouldn't do that, and then still do it :/

However, I am looking into a DBT program, which looks very active and takes a lot of time and active work, so I am hoping that this will finally be the therapy that will get me somewhere. 

Thank you for your suggestion, though - I just don't know why I've had such bad luck with very passive therapists. It's definitely something I'd keep in mind in becoming a therapist - just listening definitely doesn't work for everyone."
therapy,fqw1c25,t1_fqw0yvj,1589690159.0,"My new therapist who hopefully is different and seems different so far said that unfortunately many therapists are trained that that's the best and only way to help every patient. So it really sucks that it's embedded in the system to just nod, listen, and agree. 

I've wasted so so so many hours and so so so much money on therapy only to realize I wasted time talking about how my week sucked and them agreeing with no comment. I've nearly lost hope for any therapy helping me because it's so hard to find a therapist that doesn't do that. It's a real struggle honestly"
therapy,fqvzxfo,t3_gl824o,1589689123.0,"I've been to multiple therapists before and have had trouble finding one that sticks. They weren't good fits for me for really the same reason: they were all listen, no talk. 

For me, personally, I need a therapist that can hold me accountable and who will actually try to come up with things I can do to help my experiences. When they just sit there and nod and agree with things and say how that 'must be hard' it just gets me very frustrated. It's like yes, it is hard, I am suffering, but what are you going to do about it? 

Don't get me wrong - some patients will benefit from just being able to vent to you, no problem solving involve. But for me, and few others I've talked to, we need advice, comments, questions, and active therapy in order to actually get better."
TalkTherapy,fqvxppd,t1_fqvqkie,1589687579.0,"Thank you, this is good to keep in mind. I am just hopeful because I've tried a lot of therapists before and it has never gotten me anywhere, but a DBT program seems different and like it actually might do something. I hope either way I find a group or therapist that does more than just listen to me talk and not make any moves towards fixing the behaviors."
TalkTherapy,fqstqvy,t1_fqskita,1589618537.0,"Thank you for your detailed response! Would you also happen to know about 24/7 DBT coaches? It says they will have someone assigned to you available 24/7 for crises to call - do you think they charge you to talk to the DBT coach?

I really hope I am able to get into the scholarship class for the program that mentions a lot of what I am asking about, or that the other group is just as involved as a program. 

Again thank you for reading and for your response!"

MyChemicalRomance,fgeopvl,t3_exzlr9,1580705035.0,"I bought mine through the website itself, and it doesn't show up on my Wells Fargo Center account at all. Not in order history or my tickets or anything.

But I called the center themselves and gave someone the confirmation number and my information, and she was able to pull up my order and confirm that it's there. It also charged me. 

The site was so awful to buy from since it crashed so many times, so that's reason for paranoia, but also probably the reason why it's not showing up in order history. 
You're probably fine! Best of luck to you."

NCSU,f6kmsrl,t3_drqdb1,1572915546.0,"The Counseling Center Page gives a lot of information about this! You can find it here: 

https://counseling.dasa.ncsu.edu/

But, from my experience, in order to get your first appointment scheduled you do a walk-in and they'll have you fill out some forms on the computer. You can't schedule your first appointment via the computer or phone. They'll then have you meet with a triage counselor to determine your needs and who you'd fit with and the urgency of your situation. You'll schedule your first appointment sometime after that if you don't need immediate assistance. 

Whenever you meet your therapist express your concerns about the disorder and symptoms. Be aware a lot of therapists nowadays don't like to give out actual diagnoses, but can help you manage symptoms and talk through what you're feeling without actually putting a label on anything. 

I wish you luck and hope you get to feeling better."

college,f4p0ubl,t3_dlalx4,1571712963.0,"If you love it. 

I'm a fellow Psych major and it's the only thing that interests me. I suffer from heavy mental illness and I'm also taking an Abnormal Psychology class right now. 

I love the class, the major, and every class in the major. I do well in all my major classes. 

I do worry that my mental illness will get in the way. My Abnormal Psychology class is especially triggering - learning about eating disorders having a low recovery rate when I had a disorder, learning about suicide when I have those thoughts. 

But Psychology is the only thing I love. The only thing I can see myself in. I want to help people - especially kids - after I graduate, I want to make a difference in people's lives. 

If you love your classes and your major, it's the right one for you. If you do well because you're interested in the content, then it's the right one for you. 

Study hard, continue therapy, better yourself so that eventually you can help others too. Don't let your anxiety take this away from you - you've got this!"

Anxiety,f0hdw2q,t3_d4w9r7,1568619345.0,"Melatonin is cool, and if you don't like pills it comes in dissolvable tablets as well. 5mg works fine. Take it a few minutes before bed and it'll help your brain tell your body it's time for bed. 

Also, the more you do during the day the more tired you'll be. If you go to school and somewhere afterwards, it should be easier to fall asleep just from being tired - but I know for myself I could never get myself to do anything after school, so I understand if that doesn't work. 

I wish you luck and hope you find something that works! Definitely give melatonin a shot."

depression,ewtl4lm,t3_cpvwhh,1565747730.0,"I feel this. I actually am very open about how shit I feel, even if just in jokes, and that somehow makes this urge to 'break' worse.

I explain to everyone that I am depressed, that I have horrible anxiety. But I do everything - I have to do everything. I HAVE to shower every day, no matter what - that's what anxiety says. I am exhausted and I can't give myself a break because even on vacations there are things I have to do every single day. Keep myself clean, do my hair the same way, put on day-clothes, stuff like that. 

Nobody around me can understand how truly awful I feel on a daily basis because it does not show. My anxiety does not let it show. They don't understand that I can't handle both a job and being a full-time student - because they see me handle those things separately so I must be capable, right? 

It's a horribly frustrating feeling to know that no one can fully grasp how truly miserable you are. I just keep going. Until I get the chance to stop."
