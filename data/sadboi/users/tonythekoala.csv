worldpolitics,fcwdhn8,t1_fcw9mht,1578022888.0,"It’s not literally giving money, I agree with you there. They didn’t give Amazon billions but loopholes which exist, and they do exist, allow them to essentially write off their profits through various means mentioned above (paying employees in stock who, ironically, have to pay tax on that income), reinvesting into growth, writing off certain assets or assets whose values depreciate (this I have less to argue about). Ergo money which they SHOULD be paying in taxes are not being paid. So the taxpayers end up picking up the slack. 


https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/you-paid-taxes-these-corporations-didnt/

I agree that nothing they do is illegal. However illegal and immoral are two wholly separate discussions. And I think people are waking up to the notion that corporations should simply pay their damn taxes rather than having an army of accountants who can whip up a list of tax deductibles/exploitable loopholes.

worldpolitics,fcvrdkg,t1_fctxiee,1578008375.0,"What story did I make up, exactly? Your conversation devolved into a discussion on tax breaks given to amazon, a subject I will freely admit I know diddly squat about as a citizen in the UK. The discussion on tax incentives, as I said in previous comment, is part of an overall larger discussion on Amazon/Google/Netflix (pick a company, they all do it) using loopholes to avoid taxation. That is the discussion that I am bothered about. But for reference to people struggling whilst being amazing employees:

Granted Amazon recently committed to a $15 minimum wage for a quarter of a million US workers (not sure of exact figures of them) and that is undeniably a huge plus. But increasing costs of living, big medical debts (your healthcare system is whack), student loan debts (again-whack) mean the harsh and undeniable reality is that many workers ARE struggling. That might not be struggling to you, either because you’re an entitled individual who doesn’t see/isn’t living that struggle or because you’re actually below even that line in which case I feel for you. 

You might say it’s not Amazon who is at fault for those factors contributing to people’s financial hardship. But as a front runner in private business endeavours you set an example and:

Peoples argument, which is a valid one if you consider laws to be immutable (they are not), is that they aren’t breaking the law to do so. They’re doing what most corporations do, using loopholes, paying employees using stock, depreciating assets etc. 

I think the line of thinking most people take is that laws might be considered as up for change in the current political climate, what with companies such as Amazon, Google etc being worth inconceivable amounts of money yet taking advantage of a system which allows them to declare themselves profitless, at times. By the letter of the law they are but by a common sense approach, Dafooq?

Also worth noting as a caveat that I read an article which seemed to suggest that we can use $500/£500 billion (not sure which currency) to implement short term solutions to the climate change issue facing the world ATM, giving us 20 or so years to innovate our way out of this mess. 

If there was a global shift in values RE taxation and the perfectly legal avoidance tactics used by corporations that sum of money would be available at the drop of a hat. 
But there isn’t, and there probably won’t be, because of people like yourself who feel they’ve achieved something with their “I win” comments when they are either intentionally ignoring the wider conversation or are genuinely just unaware of it. I genuinely don’t understand what you win. A medal? Personal satisfaction? “I’m a douche avoid association with me” points?

I wanna understand ur mind I really do. Not because I like you but because I think it’s imperative people who think these things ARE issues understand how best to persuade you, and people like you, that Amazon and Google etc don’t have any human values. Because they aren’t human, they’re a hayooge machine, whirring away, which is built on an abstraction"

I would love to know why you gain personal satisfaction in potentially being right on, as I say, one subsection of the overall issue when there are people who live in their vehicles, people who, due to America’s clearly backwards insurance based market approach to healthcare, live in constant crippling fear of illness not because they will become ill but because the financial ramifications mean their LIVES will be ripped from under them.

The context of the reply does suggest that possibly he included that part of the message as a caveat to alleviate his own guilt- in which case he is the dick that everybody seems willing to believe he is. 

However everybody sat reaching conclusions without knowing the full contextual info seems pretty silly to me. I know that’s what this sub is about but come on guys, critical thinking. Please.

JordanPeterson,f9sknlu,t3_e6npj6,1575594248.0,"Could this not be attributed to IQ being a measure of problem solving (mix of analytic thinking, mathematical ability), traits which are defined as more ‘masculine’ whereas the traditionally ‘feminine’ intelligence traits such as emotional intelligence do not factor into IQ whatsoever.

Ergo increased exposure to fathers leads to a higher development of these traits? Particularly at a young age when brains are most reticent. 
Genuinely curious as to other people’s interpretations and/or personal experiences in this. 

I never really enjoyed a relationship with my mother and, after discussions with my father, we have both come to the possible conclusion that any parental influence on the development of my EI  was largely in fact due to him being raised by his mother rather than his father?

I’ve been shown that UK equivalent are guilty of doing the same in America and find it equally reprehensible.

I think we’re just waiting for the day that we wake up and realise that, globally, healthcare should not be an industry motivated by profits. It’s research & development costs could hopefully be financed through a global healthcare tax or something? Some things should be a global endeavour imo.

Therefore here I am making this argument in the hopes of persuading one person (or more if I’m lucky) to vote labour and give them a chance, now, before it may be too late.

If these corporations are willing to employ the tactics I’ve discussed above, and American Government is willing to let them, on their own citizens then I’m pretty sure the goal is the same over here also. If there’s a trade deal we can strike which allows us to refine their patenting procedures or even a new system of our own then I’m all for it. And yes I know we don’t manufacture our own drugs.
