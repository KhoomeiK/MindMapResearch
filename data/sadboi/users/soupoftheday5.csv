As for the other situation for the Army. I joined to blow shit up, deploy, blah blah all that fun shit. Well immediately after BOLC I volunteered to stay in tradoc for a guaranteed chance at getting a tab, attending as many schools as possible, learning as much as I could, little did I know those were empty promises and I realized soon after volunteering.

 I hated my duty station with a passion and was stuck doing bullshit tradoc stuff but I persevered and kept fighting for my chance to get a tab. Once we got a new Commander I was sent not only once but twice. I am currently writing this from sapper school and confident I will tab this time around.

So keep fighting man, everyday can feel like groundhogs day in the army but it's what you put in. I didn't join the army to be the AER rep or write a conop for family day. But if you keep trying to get where you want to be, eventually you will make it."

Your not an NCO either and as soon as you get there drills will put you in your place real quick and tell you to stay in your lane.

Ok, now that I am on my laptop I can answer your question--

1. Yes, it is a trap. It is a dumb job, not a good experience for a cherry LT.
2. That depends on your command team and drills. I have had 2 different CO and 2 different XOs during my time and they both had different expectations for when they want you to be at work. Generally I get to work at 0630ish, do my morning PT, start work at 0830 after hygiene then leave around 1700.
3. Yes, you can have a life. I have made it clear to my leadership that BJJ is a big time hobby of mine and I prefer to make it to practice at 1830 a few times a week.
4. Not sure what you mean by this-- we have cycle break where no trainees are in and you are doing odd jobs, such as PCS gifts, inventories, preparing for next cycle, making mock-ups
5. For me, **shitty**. I was fooled into this job by being sold on schooling opportunities. ""being stationed on FLW you will have so many opportunities blah blah blah""... NO, not true. If you have a shitty commander that does not want to send you to school, he will not sign that 4187. Literally happened to me.

During BOLC, they told us that if we stayed and did this dumbass job we would get ranger and sapper as a guarantee. That was 1000% lie. Because right in my initial counsel, my CO literally said, ""that is not a guarantee, you will earn that blah blah, you can go in October"" October rolled around and that still did not happen, at that point I knew I was fucked. Luckily my new CO has been willing to send us.

**HOWEVER,**

Think big picture, any job in the army/marines will give you basic combat training, from being a 42A (admin) to being a 13B (artillery man), everyone goes through Basic combat training and will shoot weapons, maybe learn MOUT training, learn first aid/TCCC, etc. 

Everyone who joins or is interested in joining I tell them the same thing, look for job that you enjoy but can get you a job if you decide to get out. Being a combat engineer or tanker might sound badass, but there is a very very low demand for those skill sets when you get out. 

Obviously you are interested in being a police officer, but life happens, maybe you get hurt during your service and get medically discharged ? Maybe you meet a special someone while you are in? Get a job that can get a transferrable skill set. My supply NCO has kicked down doors and cleared rooms, shot all kinds of weapons etc. Its just not his primary job. If he gets out tomorrow, (which he is getting discharged for medical reasons) he spent his time doing fun stuff but also learning skills that can land him a job.
