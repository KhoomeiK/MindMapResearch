I'll admit that I have personally seen few example of extremism coming from The Left supporters (and as aggressive as they are, they are not nearly as intense and hazardous as the right wing's propaganda), but overall, it has nothing to do with the party's policies, which call for the same anti-establishment ideals that would better the life of the average citizen. It is very similar to what is happening in the US: People either making up defamatory stories leftist personalities, or picking on the minor flaws of their comments and making a big deal out of nothing.
Unfortunately, Germany doesn't really have that many outspoken celebrities and famous figures that can call out the right-wing media on their bullshit, so the majority of people have fallen for it, and we are continuously risking a decline in the way of living, while the rich remain untouched."

If I don't start snapping back at them, it's gonna end up with me hurting myself one way or another. If things really are gonna change for someday, I feel like if all this bottled-up rage is gonna affect my future relationships with people whom I'm gonna actually care about."
Anxiety,ew1wtlr,t1_ew1szj9,1565033213.0,"I would gladly do that with strangers, but the problem is that this is a close family member that I'm referring to. If I say anything like that to her face, then my parents, and the rest of my family, will stop talking to me (I've never been my parents' favorite child, so it's natural that I'm at fault when it comes to any conflict, big or small, which includes me). I know I shouldn't care about them disliking me so much, and I don't want to, but it's hard to ignore that when you're underage (Can't go live alone), and you live in a small house where you can't escape running into one of them everytime you get out of your room to go pee, eat, or whatever. The issue of my inability to confront them is just a small particle of a massive problem that I have with my family. I figured that if i can just overcome that, then it would make me a bit at ease with myself while I'm still there."
science,ew1itm8,t3_cm6ee1,1565024314.0,"I might be wrong, but I personally think that while spending an unhealthy amount of time using audiovisual, interactive platforms HAS a certain effect on the cognitive, behavioral development of persons, its effect is only as perceivable as the behavior that has been previously shaped as a result to parental nurture, and possibly even genetic factors. Meaning that if the personality is equipped with a ""healthy"" basis, i.e: not prone to violent tendencies or anything, video games/movies/tv shows/whatever have minimum effect (and possibly no effect at all if a moderated, healthy amount of time and effort was dedicated to them)"
BlackPeopleTwitter,ew1gjm7,t1_ew1ca0q,1565022928.0,"Honest question, when was the last time someone who was sentenced to a ""death penalty"" in the United States actually ended up getting executed? Because as far as I know, all the legislative, judiciary and executive bodies governing the country are aware that there is a general consensus among the public that condemns the death penalty; therefore, the sentence remains only nominal."
depression,evyrhwe,t3_ck913s,1564939609.0,"Maybe this is why people who finally decide on committing suicide feel so much bliss shortly prior to going through with it. There is no longer an internal battle, one side has finally taken over the other, and the voice that has always told them that it would get better is shut down for good. As someone who has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for more than 10 years, I'm conflicted about whether I actually want to feel that kind of bliss or not."
depression,evyqknz,t3_ckvvkz,1564938954.0,"This is a feeling that I became aware of when I was a teenager, and it stayed with me ever since. I've always felt like my mind and spirit operate differently than everyone else's around me, and not in a ""I'm a genius"" way either. I look at everyone around me, and I envy them because of how easily they blend into every situation, and with anyone, and maybe if I want to succeed in this life, I'm gonna have to -somehow- force myself to become like one of them, even though I'm not really sure how to do it, and whether it's even possible to begin with, and part of me doesn't want to become like them because I dislike these people. I don't know where's the solution. Maybe to keep fighting? But I honestly hope there is one."
