Can barely even stay up for the whole day (bad urge to take naps) but I guess that has to do with me being hypothyroid aswell. I would go for walks but I live in a pretty cold place and I've gotten some cold intolerance this winter. The struggle is real, hope you get better"
depression,fdhk1oa,t1_fdhje1i,1578424298.0,I do indeed. Been so out of it and tired for a good while now that I havent done anything else than sit at a computer pretty much. I guess the lack of exercise causes some of the fog too.
