I don’t know any teacher who hasn’t been kept up at night worrying about a kid, or been brought to tears by something nice or impressive a student did. I have been teaching for 4 years now, one of which was as a supply teacher, and I remember all the kids I’ve taught - I occasionally recognise kids I had for just one day when I’m out and about."

Healthyhooha,fn1kkjg,t1_fn0qj8x,1586563990.0,"When you are at all tense or not really feeling it, the vagina won’t respond appropriately. There can be a huge difference in size when you’re properly aroused and when you’re just trying too hard and worrying. My advice is stop worrying about penetration, and spend some time working out what else feels good for you. Try stimulating your clitoris or nipples, or other parts of your body, and work out what you like. With a dedicated half hour or so to just turning yourself on, you might find the muscles in your vagina relax, and it’s able to stretch further. If not, as a lesbian I can safely say there’s more to sex than penetration ;)"

Not sure where you live, but I’ve heard news stories from various countries of people being arrested and charged when they did idiotic things with the intention of spreading Coronavirus. The fact that he made this threat will certainly help you with any custody or residency court proceedings. Maybe you could talk to him over text or messenger if he leaves again, then maybe you’ll have some written evidence of this?

I think you’re absolutely right to be leaving him, for you and your child."

relationship_advice,fdab5he,t3_ek7tvr,1578243984.0,"All of the above, but also to add stay away from alcohol or drugs for a while - it can be easy to overdo it. When my brother attempted suicide i decided to have a glass of wine to calm my nerves, and it turned into a bottle and a hangover that really didn’t help. I also did several very impulsive things, such as shave half my head. Being impulsive isn’t always bad, but if you really feel like doing something that’s unusual for you, just take a step back and check you’re not going to regret it.

Feeling your feelings is super important, and please make sure you have someone you trust to talk to who isn’t a parent - they might have different grieving methods to you, and may want t9 talk about it less, or in a different way. Not to say don’t talk to them, but it can be helpful to talk to someone more removed, also so you can acknowledge feelings you may not be proud of as well. Try not to judge yourself for any selfish feelings either, such as wanting to move on, or feeling anger that he did this to your family."

mentalhealth,fa0augo,t3_e7iu2q,1575751827.0,"I totally get why you feel this way - the rhetoric we’re often fed is that being gay is a choice, and gay people are being way too out there and should just shut up. The reality is that you are the same person you’ve always been, you’re just learning to accept a part of yourself that you felt you couldn’t. I didn’t come out even to myself until my mid twenties, it took that long to unlearn this shit.
You absolutely don’t have to tell anyone unless it’s your choice, but it might be helpful to share these thoughts with a trusted friend, or a mental health professional, who can help you get through this difficult and confusing time in your life. All the evidence shows that gay people do not have a choice, and cannot “become straight”, and that any attempt is seriously damaging. Like the previous commenter, feel free to message me if you would like any support from an Internet stranger - I understand that can sometimes be easier than talking to people in your life."

I can be having a great day, then I start thinking awful things about myself for no reason, and that moves on to working out how I could kill myself as quickly as possible from wherever I am. It’s important to remember that suicidal ideation doesn’t mean you’re actually going to kill yourself, although it can be scary. Just make sure you’re talking about this with someone you trust, preferably a mental health professional, and that you’re taking any meds you’ve been prescribed."

Teachers,f5s8mod,t3_doyto1,1572416690.0,"I think it’s a combination of things, including school policy and environment, as well as student backgrounds.

Same goes for families who constantly talk about how pointless school is, and undermine the teachers."
AmItheAsshole,f5s85in,t3_dos259,1572416016.0,"NTA, actions have consequences. However, I do agree with your husband that he ought to be allowed to earn the privilege back. Not sure how long before Halloween this was, but perhaps he could have earned his trick or treating in increments, like one good deed = 1 house or something?

I am a primary school teacher, and I’m sure you are aware of this, but carrots almost always work better than sticks when it comes to behaviour management, although sometimes punitive measures are necessary. We are taught early on, however, that any punishments ought to be administered ASAP, and if that’s not possible, the child should be able to prove they have changed their behaviour, and earn the right to avoid the punishment if they can. This goes for all children, regardless of whether they’re on the spectrum.

All that said, I think you did the right thing by giving him a clear consequence for his actions, and from the sounds of it, you also criticised his behaviour instead of his personality/condition, which is very important."

There’s always a back and forth dance when you offer to pay for something, it’s socially acceptable and expected to insist on paying several times if you can afford to, not just accepting it when someone else offers to pay, no matter how emphatically they offer. You should have insisted, or replayed them in kind, by insisting on paying for them the next time."
