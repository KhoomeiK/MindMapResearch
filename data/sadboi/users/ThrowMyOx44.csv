The other one being the natural reluctance/hesitation that comes with thinking about death, but if I didn't have my mom & brother.. I'd still hesitate, god damn this back-and-forth."
SuicideWatch,fd6gy0u,t1_fd5dvqt,1578190851.0,"Thank you a lot, for your concern and willingness to help.. <3 I deeply appreciate it.. in a way, until my depressive and dissociative states take over and I become someone else. It's really getting unliveable, and I know it'll be like this for the rest of my life.. I just really don't see a way out. My heart goes out to you, and also your interest in psychology is appreciated."
SuicideWatch,fcze681,t1_fcz0p2m,1578099171.0,"Thank you for the concern <3 I appreciate. I have looked into mostly everything. I should be graduating in Psychology this year and have always been interested in the neurobiological side. I don't want to say that I'm an expert, but many experts will also confirm the fact that once you're born & developed a certain way, it's very hard or even impossible to change some aspects of your thinking or your personality. Mine is unfortunately too clusterfucked to be able to be changed. Even genetic editing with Crispr9, which is cutting edge, would hardly be able to make a meaningful difference in an already developed brain.

Cheers, and thank you :) I am happy now, that I talked to my girlfriend which I love. But it's bittersweet, and I'd rather not tell the rest of the story. She loves me but I'm too incapable of dealing with life due to my illnesses. I wish I could at least die right now, while still happy."
SuicideWatch,fcyjtqr,t1_fcyhuxb,1578081281.0,How did you survive though? That's.. kinda impossible.
SuicideWatch,fcyjlwg,t1_fcwnn1s,1578081163.0,"I guess I might share some features, but regardless, all individuals are unique due to the complexity of the brain. Which is why the NIMH made a fuss about DSM's categorial approach and is trying to move to a more dimensional one. Still though, it's quite clear you can't un-retard someone or cure schizophrenia or bipolar."
SuicideWatch,fcw3m6k,t1_fcvy4xx,1578016372.0,What drugs did you OD on though?
SuicideWatch,fcw22eq,t3_ej5mz0,1578015347.0,I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope we all make it out :d
SuicideWatch,fcu4rdj,t1_fctdoez,1577972526.0,"I think we should honestly give ourselves in for research. It's probably not autism because we're not stuck inside our own heads fully, but it definitely is something curious.

Can you yourself talk easily to people if you're somewhere social? Or are you quiet most of the time because words & thoughts are very hard to come up with (almost impossibly so)?"
