Hello guys! I’m looking for some pointers for the test. I’m using Khan Academy to brush up on what I need to study for the Aptitude test. 

From what I see, they recommend Reading Comprehension and Math (Specifically Álgebra and Trigonometry).

I was wondering if anyone has any pointers on what I should study for specifically in Algebra. It’s been a while and I feel I should brush up for the test. I’m using Khan Academy and I’m going to study Algebra Basics, Álgebra I, Algebra II, and Trigonometry. 

I was never too great at Geometry/Trigonometry so I will study that the most BUT is there specific sections I should focus on for Algebra? Like should I not worry about Algebraic expressions? Should I study linear equations and graphing more? Any help would be appreciated!"

AmItheAsshole,fnsc3x7,t3_g3keje,1587218310.0,"NTA, I feel this is an over reaction. You should ask her why this upset her so much. Ask her why she felt the trust was betrayed. This is a really good hurdle to face before jumping into a marriage. You need to find the root of her anger. Why are you angry? Why do you feel the trust was betrayed? This is a “Secret Room” but honestly, more of a surprise room for her since you were waiting to surprise her with it. That’s like holding onto a secret ring waiting for the moment to surprise her with commitment. Which, she isn’t upset about that.

You guys are about to spend your lives together and you will constantly learn new things about each other. You can’t know everything. That’s where the trust comes in. She must already have trust issues with you to freak out about this small thing and you guys need to tackle that or you may be miserable."

OnePiece,fnm99ki,t1_fnm81bs,1587067311.0,"Remember, the anime is an adaptation of the original work which is the manga. This is directly from the creator himself. I would start over from the beginning, plus you might catch stuff you missed before. 

I can’t speak for the Viz, I have only used the Shonen jump app. It’s a monthly subscription but only $2 and you get access to all of it and many other manga they have. There’s a new one called Undead Unluck and it is amazing so far. I’ve read all of Bleach also. Also reading:

- Mashle Magic and Muscles (new)
- Black Clover
- My Hero Academia
- Demon Slayer Kimetsu no yaiba (they are working getting all volumes added, they only need to add like 2-3 more and seems to be one a month right now)
- Dragon Ball Super
- One Punch Man
- Boruto
- Dr. Stone

Reading a few more too. There are also the completed mangas (I wish they would add YuYu Hakusho but they only have it to buy right now).

So based on what I told you, you can make your decision from there I hope."
OnePiece,fnm2fmz,t3_g2776v,1587063920.0,"I started with the anime as a kid. I started reading the manga and it is absolutely amazing. Easy to follow. I can see the pictures moving in my head (like the flow of combat, it’s just so well drawn) and the sound of things that happen. I think what helped me though, was watching the anime when I was younger. It helped me give the manga it’s sound. 

The pacing of the anime is just atrocious though. It is so painfully, slow. The pacing of the manga is superb.

Animation is also terrible in the anime. The manga never has an issue of this due to lack of animation, but Oda does so well in showing the movement of the combat. 

One Piece manga has INCREDIBLE EMOTION! What makes it so beautiful, is the emotions are drawn so well. Happy, anger, ESPECIALLY SADNESS!! When he draws his characters sad, you see all that comes with it. The contorted face, the tears, AND THE BOOGERS TOO! He shows the ugliness of crying to which just makes it feel so real. 

Study those panels of his. So many panels will have the crew or someone of the crew doing something hilarious in the background. He gives so much character to all the characters even if they aren’t the star of the panel.

I love the manga so much. The anime is too much of a disappointment for me. I suggest reading the manga using the Shonen jump app."
OnePiece,fnlw2lw,t3_g29mge,1587060738.0,"94 episodes in, you aren’t too far. I think it would be a good idea to start reading the manga and see which you like better. I prefer manga over anime.

Me personally, the anime’s all have bad animation and pacing imo. I absolutely love the manga. I’ve read it 4-5 times now over the years. Sometimes after a while I just get in the mood to go through One Piece. Although sometimes, during an arc, I start to forget things that happened earlier and many panels stop making sense to me. So I will restart either the arc or I will re-read all of one piece. It’s just that good and easy to follow."

It caused me to have hallucinations and I couldn’t sleep. Constant nightmares. It was terrible. But, I’ve gone through about 8 med changes until I found the right combination. You also want to couple it with therapy as the pill isn’t going to cure you (also, you may not be “cured”, for example mine is hereditary and I’m just stuck with depression. I don’t produce enough happy chemicals, so I gotta learn to work around that. I wanted to give up many times and sometimes I still do as I get tired of battling it, but I always somehow get through. Just gotta find positives as it’s not all negative). Instead of cure, they maintain, but different meds affect people differently. They want you in school to keep you busy, but I get it. You just don’t feel like doing it. Also, rumors spread. Kids are cruel too. But, some of my best friends were made through school so I can’t say it was a terrible time when I was in school.
