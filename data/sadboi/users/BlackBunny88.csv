When it comes to her having followers, I'm not sure although I think she was trying to slowly low key recruit.

She had these Personal Assistans that she didn't pay who did her favors and she'll repay them in favors, but like rarely and they would be so grateful. Then all of a sudden they just wouldnt come back and then she'd talk badly about them to us (me and my sister).

She also would ask me and my sister to give her massages and take away the tension and negativity and us refusing to do it will just increase the negativity and tension, because we were being toxic. I'm guessing she used similar manipulation, methods to her PA's."
