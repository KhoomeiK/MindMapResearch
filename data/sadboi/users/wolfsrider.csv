insaneparents,fjc44rt,t1_fjb5qk0,1583208117.0,"7 years ago, when I attempted, I was out of state at college, so I had to call my parents to tell them (otherwise the school was going to). The first thing my mother said was ""that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard"". Followed by ""I'm running errands, I'll call you later."" She will vehemently deny this now, however. When she later called me, it was ~9pm and she yelled at me for almost 3 hours.


I feel your pain, OP. I'm so sorry you have to deal with all this negativity after such a traumatic incident. I hope that you can do some healing, and recommend that you bring your parents to some group therapy sessions. When you feel ready, of course"

AmItheAsshole,f6zzsgm,t3_dtwpu4,1573322763.0,"It might not be a terrible idea to contact an attorney, OP. My father works on cases like this all the time, and while he's usually able to get the charge/sentence reduced, he ALWAYS requires his client to retake a driving course as a stipulation for his assistance, regardless of the outcome. I know several of his clients have received community service as a result, and only one of them has been a repeat client. 


Still, I understand your reluctance to help your son. After all, he is an adult, and he got himself into this mess. Keep in mind also that not helping him now could drive a wedge in your relationship with him. If you are unwilling to help him now, he may not seek your help later when he needs it."

AskReddit,eywg9s5,t3_cz2apy,1567528801.0,"I was 13 when I first started to shave my legs, but didn't notify my mother until this incident. So, here I was in the shower with a fresh (safety) razor and a flawed process. I used shaving cream, so I had to clean the blades off every time I stood back up. For some reason, I decided it would be a good idea to shake it off after I rinsed it. It seemed to be working pretty well until I got too close to my body and sliced open a 4 inch gash on the top of my thigh. I remember staring at it in confusion for a little bit before I started feeling a little faint. I immediately started screaming for my mother, who wrapped me up and bandaged my leg. It definitely should have gotten stitches, but it wasn't something my family could afford at the time, so instead I just kept it bandaged and walked very carefully at school."

AskReddit,er7wdpq,t3_c0qaj7,1560589651.0,"I was a school portrait photographer working in a massively understaffed office for two years. This meant that we were often working shifts anywhere from 8-14 hours long. Every. Single. Day. We often had to eat/pee between class pictures, if we were even lucky enough to get that few minutes. After ~9 months I really started dreading Tuesdays (when the next week's schedule was released). I started getting really depressed and anxious, waking up every morning with the urge to stab myself so I wouldn't have to go to work. I finally got tired of my excuses and quit. I told my superiors that the job was too long and stressful and that my mental health was more important to me.  I was definitely lucky that my partner had a job as a software engineer because it meant I didn't necessarily *need* to have a steady paycheck. I did, however, start Lyft driving on those days when I felt most like myself. 

It took another two years-ish before I felt that I was worthy of any kind of help, but when I did finally seek treatment things started to get better. I still have my dark days, but now I have a little more self esteem to fight them off with. Oh, and my amazing partner who stuck with me through all of it. üòä"
