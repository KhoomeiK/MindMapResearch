The phrase “ a rolling stone gathers no moss,” is so true. A kid who moves a lot learns to detach from deep relationships because they won’t last; and this not just applies to friendships, but familial ones too. 

She doesn’t feel attached to her family, so she can just jump to another one with ease, leaving her mom and dad behind, and it’s their own damn fault."

OWLCITY,fr0z3la,t3_glyalo,1589809994.0,"Looking at this song with fresh eyes, I believe this song is about Adam’s mental escapism and his beliefs that he has Aspergers, which makes him think differently from others. 

*”I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape.”*

Viewing things in black and white is very typical of those on the spectrum, especially prevalent in boys with Aspergers. Over analysis is also common in their thought processes, I think Adam is talking about his view and reviewing of the world. 

*”Don’t refocus your eyes in the darkness
And don’t remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we’ll unravel the mystery.”*

A neurotypical person wouldn’t be able to see what someone on the spectrum could see in terms of perspective, there’s a different way of looking at things. Adam is talking about describing his perspective to someone to unravel the “mystery” of his views. 

*”Farewell all my friends in textbooks, I’m going home,
Cuz my blood cells cannot depend on the weather in photographs,
There’s a light show out my window, somewhere way up there. 
Dear Vienna, are you singing?
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away.”*

This chorus is talking about Adam’s escapism into books and stories and pictures of faraway places. He always mentioned he never left America until he found fame, so the closest he could get to those places was photographs. He acknowledges he must say goodbye in order to live in the real world, as his body can’t depend on words and pictures to sustain him. He has to find the wonder in life outside, rather than be lost to fantasy. 

*”I was so far out of place
Watching those stars in outer space
'cause I am so far from where you are.”*

He feels like a fish out of water because his mind isn’t with everyone else, it’s far away in dreams and fantasies where others can’t reach. 

At least that’s my interpretation of the song, being lost in your daydreams and thoughts. :)"

My family was religious and didn’t approve of worldly radio stations and music so I had to listen at night with headphones on when everyone was asleep. It became my nightly ritual. One night I was flipping through the channels looking for a song that hadn’t been played 5 times within the last hour when I came across the intro to Fireflies. 

I immediately connected with the melody and the lyrics. I distinctly remember that it reminded me of the twinkling lights of a space station or a satellite, and that I danced my hands into the dark above me with the music. I spent the next week desperately chasing down that song, as when it ended they hadn’t given the name nor the artist. I eventually came across it again, got the name Owl City and jumped to Google to find out more. 

It was a big moment for me because I had a hard time as a teen in my home, and Adam’s music was one of the rare treasures I could find escapism in. That was exactly 10 years ago, and now I’m passing on that love of his music to my baby girl. 💜✨"
