The point is to vote for the politicians that fight for policy aligned with our interests. It's a social contract- the politicians (theoretically) legislate to help the majority of people, and the majority of people vote for them. 

Of course, corruption among the politicians and stupidity among the voters make this sketchy at best in reality. But the above is how it's supposed to work in theory, no?"
