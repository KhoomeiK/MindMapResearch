That, coupled with respiratory issues from smoking, is a perfectly valid reason for her to not be home.

When discussing previous sexual partners, I don’t count being assaulted. I don’t like to talk about it, it’s uncomfortable to explain, and honestly it makes me feel dirty. It’s very possible that your girlfriend hasn’t worked through the trauma of being assaulted (whether by penetration or oral sex) and simply lied about it so she wouldn’t have to discuss it. The reason I say this is because I’ve been there and done that.

Also, just because you felt comfortable disclosing your trauma to her, does not mean that she is obligated to do so for you. Everyone processes trauma differently. I’ll bring up my assault(s) occasionally, but I have another friend who absolutely refuses to talk about it at all. When she wants to talk about it, she will. Pressuring her into talking about it is going to push her away and possibly traumatize her further. What she really needs is a therapist."
