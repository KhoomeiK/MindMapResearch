Truth is that a lot of people lack the basic social skills and the drive to actually form connections. This is why you'll see people day dreaming about being X or achieving Y.
It's too easy to get into the delusional mindset of ""oh person A was introverted, he was an innovator, was shunned by society, so maybe even I might be like him deep down"". 
Whereas the truth is that 99% of these people are suffering from nothing but social anxiety or have a tough time fitting in since they carry pre-conceived notions/beliefs. If they made an attempt and followed the absolute basic advice of how they can come out of their shell (there's plenty advice on this), they'd see some success, but it's easy to be delusional and day dream of someday being someone of value or coming out of your shell instead of making any effort."
