We joke now that they use a weather rock to predict the weather, since they'll update from (for example) sunny to rainy on the weather website after it starts raining. I just found [this](https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2019/09/26/does-climate-change-make-predicting-the-weather-more-difficult) blurb from last year, and funnily enough the top link when I just googled this was from 2016. My SO and I have speculated that migraines, or at least some of them, are sinus related. I used to get the migraine aura then the awful pain. In 2001 I was put on depakote for my migraines and was told a lot of people don't get migraines after taking that for a while (I took it for a year), and after that my migraines changed to the aura then an awful sinus headache. I get both types now, along with some other weird migraine aura headache that pretty much makes me mostly blind for short amounts of time. The one that just effects my vision I've speculated was allergy related since I was a teenager, but it only recently crossed my mind that the regular migraine headache pain could also be sinus related.

I don't remember when I first heard the Berenstein/Berenstain thing, which was the only ME I was familiar with til more recently. I lived in southern California until 2014, and the forecasts there weren't as varied as they are where I live now.

I'm starting to wonder if I've always been like this, but maybe I used to always be slightly dissociated so I never noticed before; or maybe I was just always so stressed that I needed the physical release from the orgasm so I didn't notice the dissociation. It used to be that when I was manic or hypomanic, I'd want sex. Now when I'm manic or hypomanic, I don't mind naked bodies. There's a bit of a difference, and the dissociation makes sex possible these days. 

I did make some very bad choices while manic a handful of years ago and behaved in a way that was extremely out of character for me, and I think my need to dissociate comes from that, but it's also kind of nice because I'm not distracted with pesky sexual urges (haha, yes I'm slightly joking, I'm sure those urges are part of being human, and I should probably want to get back to ""normal"")

>  
>**Why do we use this number 12 to represent so much of our lives?**  
>  
>The number twelve has a special meaning in nature which is representative in math and math can help you decipher the secret mysteries of nature. You will see the fact that there is only one true square number, (144) 12 x 12 = 144, which we know as Pure Math Harmony Vertically and Horizontally. This can be easily seen in music, but this also affects our DNA and how we react to these “vibrations.”  What is very important in the “magic” of this divine number is that at 12 “symbolic of the creation of the universe” as it represents the division or fractionating of unity into twelve individual distinct sound vibrations or tones.  
>  
>Hence, this is a magical or a divine number that affects us humans in many more ways than one for it is the perfect numeral to represent how vibrations affect our DNA and souls. Whether it be through the magic of music or using it for Templar purposes in the prophecies of the Apocalypse to signify the “end or a whole.”

>The number 12 is an important one when it comes to [numerology](https://numerologysecrets.net/) since it signifies completion. It also belongs to the star sign Pisces who is known to be a spiritual sign that is in constant touch with the energies of the universe.

>For many Christians in Spain and Latin America, the holiday season officially ends on January 6, which is the 12th day of Christmas known as the Feast of the Epiphany, or Three Kings' Day. The holiday celebrates the biblical tale in which the Three Kings, or Three Wise Men, visit baby Jesus after his birth.

I honestly forgot this is also called Epiphany until I went and looked it up, it's been a while since I attended church.

I'm fairly crappy at doing eyeliner so usually just give up on it. You also have a great smile, and you look like someone I would want to be friends with. Making friends irl is tough, the few friends I've made as an adult have been through work or because we have kids the same age, and even that's difficult to maintain because life gets busy a lot. Even online friends tend to fall away because I'll get busy and forget to respond for a while, then it tapers off.

He's undiagnosed bipolar 1, he was handed a book of mental health diagnoses by a medical professional and told to read it, he came back with a couple different things he could be including bipolar 1, HFA, and ADHD. I have no idea why he wasn't officially diagnosed, and for some reason it never occurred to me to ask why he wasn't diagnosed by that medical professional at the time. He does have a lot of symptoms of basically permanent mania, and he does a reality check on himself a lot to see if he's having delusions of grandeur or if it's real. (he comes up with ""this is real"" 9/10 times.) These past couple years he's gotten his health and emotional regulation more under control, and has been looking into esoteric mysticism (and he's gotten me into it! I'm bipolar disorder unspecified, and am actually diagnosed as such.) I agree with a lot of what he says and sees, his reality checks and such, but the more I'm on this sub reading peoples accounts, the more I wonder if he is just manic. I hate that I'm doubting him, because that's what it comes down to. I've had breakthroughs about myself when I'm more in tune with the world and looking more into esoteric mysticism. He and I have wondered if these mental health disorders are supposed to help us reach enlightenment, but some current cultures only want you to be a good little worker bee so we are prescribed things to make us fit in to the hive mind (I recently finished reading Fall by Neal Stephenson and this just seems a strangely apt analogy after reading that).
