I used to be in a relationship with someone similar. We were together in and off for over 3 years. During this time, he was often secretive and shady, especially involving other women. After our last fight, which eventually led me to breaking up to him, a friend gave me this analogy:

Imagine that you bought a beautiful vase. Then, one day you dropped it and a piece broke off. You were able to glue it back together, and it still looked great. Then, one day you dropped it again, and it broke into a few pieces, but it was still salvageable, so you glued to back together. It held up for a while. Then, you dropped it AGAIN, but this time it shattered into hundreds of pieces. At this point, the only thing you could do was throw the vase away (knowing that someday you will find an even more lovely vase.)

9 months after my breakup, I fell in love with someone else who is amazing and treats me great. We have been together for 10 years and are now married. :)

Stay strong!"

femalehairadvice,fm5o334,t3_ft5n9p,1585776614.0,"I’m a licensed cosmetologist; I would recommend using semi-permanent dye in a level 7 or 8. Since the ends of your hair are bleached, it will be more porous meaning it will soak up extra dye, so the color will appear a bit darker than a true level 7 or 8. I would go with something neutral, as the ends of your hair are cool, but the middle is warm. It will blend the color and look more natural, without completely covering the ombré effect. Don’t use permanent or your hair will be uneven and damaged. The semi-permanent will fade away without damaging your hair making it easier for a hair stylist to work with if you end up wanting to get balayage after the quarantine is over."

She had been abused by a man and lived in a house with several other dogs, all fighting for the same bowl of food. She was food aggressive, would lunge and bark at random men while I was walking her, and hated other dogs. She would pee on my bed and even tore up a 4x4 patch of carpet in my house. She would rip apart blankets and tore the curtains down several times. Not having much experience with dogs like this, I read a ton of books on training techniques. I began to hand feed her and would slowly introduce her to new people and dogs. Now, she is the sweetest, most gentle girl ever.

He had skied since he was 3, and I’m from Florida and had never skied or boarded before. He was such a terrible teacher, and I was terrified. At one point, I started crying and screaming, “I’m moving back to Florida!!”

A ski patroller approached us and said, “The number one cause of breakups in a ski town is trying to reach your significant other how to ski.” He offered me a snowmobile ride down and a voucher for a free lesson starting in 20 mins. My boyfriend tried to argue against it, but I was like, “Absolutely!”

By the end of that lesson, I could make it down a green run without falling. I took weekly lessons for the rest of that season and by the end of the season, I could ski blue runs with ease and easier black runs. 

That was 9 years ago. Now I LOVE skiing, was a kids ski instructor for three winters, can confidently ski double black terrain, and... then boyfriend and I are now happily married. He actually proposed to me when we were skiing. :)

Makeup,evuxit3,t3_clemna,1564810014.0,"L’Oréal double extend beauty tubes is $10 and just like Theive Causemetics Lash Extensions which is $24. People either love or hate fiber mascaras. I love them because I have terrible allergies, and it’s the only kind that doesn’t come off when I rub my eyes, yet it comes off easily with lukewarm water and no makeup remover!"
relationships,evux50d,t3_cl54rf,1564809581.0,"In January of 2010, at age 21, I decided that I wanted to leave Florida for something new. I was a hair stylist who had never hiked, camped, or really done anything outdoorsy. I had broken up with my manipulative, cheating boyfriend of 3 years a few months before. I found Coolworks.com and started applying for summer jobs at lodges in national parks all over the country. My friends and family thought I was INSANE.

I applied to 10 different jobs in Denali National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Mt. Rainier National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and others. I started to do a ton of research on the places I had applied and really had my heart set on Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. It just felt... right. By early April, I received offers from 9 places but not from the lodge in the Tetons. I was pretty sad and started to think it may be a sign that the summer job idea was silly. A few days later I received an offer to work at the lodge in the Tetons, beginning the first week of May until later October. My family took bets on how long I would last, but on the night before I left one of my best friends was like, “I think you’re going to meet a big hairy mountain man and never come home.”

My first day there, I met my now husband. A big hairy mountain man. He had come from a winter job at a ski area and a week before ski season ended managed to land a summer gig at the lodge. We immediately hit it off — not just in a romantic way, but like in a best friend, soulmate type way. Sounds cheesy, but I had never met someone I was so drawn to... someone who was so sweet, so funny, and so adventurous. 

We spent 5 years doing seasonal work at different ski areas and national parks before settling in Colorado. We got married in May. :) SO looking forward to a lifetime of adventures."

I would definitely recommend choosing an Ikon or Epic (but boo, Vail!) pass destination as your “base ski area” and take weekends to explore new places!"
