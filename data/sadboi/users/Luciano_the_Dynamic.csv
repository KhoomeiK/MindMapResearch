""This ap wus good and needs no improovements. 5 stars!"" Is a shining example of how not to write a review.

'Breaking Bad' might be considered as the best written show in the last fifteen, but that still doesn't mean it has no flaws. 

Even if a reviewer has many followers, you still should not take his or her word as truth for any work of art or application they review. No matter how big their fanbase is, they can be wrong and are not above the possibility of being wrong."
