I was aware of his existence for a few months before that but neither of us had initiated contact. Coming across his insightful posts I found myself increasingly drawn to him and began messaging him. Our messages started out friendly but it was clear from the get go we were attracted to each other and the flirting undertones slowly grew stronger. We started watching movies together (which I thought was cute at the time) through written chat, then through voice chat, and all this time we are confiding in each other more and more, until one day he sends me a picture of a handwritten letter with beautiful drawings on it expressing his feelings for me & asking me to be his girlfriend. ;\_; Honestly who does that these days? It was just the sweetest thing and ever since then we've been together :) We are from different countries so we met up as soon as we could to make sure we were physically compatible too, and it turned out we were, which made me super happy since I was kind of worried we wouldn't hit it off as well in person. 

I wasn't looking for love at all at the time since I was trying to work on myself but I consider meeting someone like him on a forum like that a 1 in a mil chance. He is a lovely person, supports me more than any bf I've had and overall makes me feel glad to be with him :)"
