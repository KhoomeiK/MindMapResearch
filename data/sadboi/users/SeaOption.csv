mentalhealth,fnsc4gp,t3_g3isw7,1587218320.0,"You write that you ""shutdown"", whatever the reason may be, this can make it a challenge to help. Not willing to talk about deeper emotional challenges is obviously your choice, however, this can create a barrier to really working with yourself to create healthy changes. The outcome of these two challenges; a potential limit on the effectiveness of the therapy you seek.

I suppose goal setting is critical and is defined by you. Maybe the most immediate goal can be; how can I learn to open up so I can start talking about deeper emotional things.

The above aside, finding the right therapist in general can be tough. You need to pick someone you feel comfortable with and that has the right philosophy for you. You also need to be empathetic towards them, they can't solve problems for you, and they're only able to work with what you give them.

aspd,fapyx8s,t1_fakwxrl,1576295419.0,"DBT is based on CBT and is used extensively to treat BPD. I would say that there is evidence that would support CBT in assisting individuals with at least one PD, BPD (not disagreeing with your statement about psychonalysis). Haven't looked at the evidence for its effectiveness with ASPD, I also haven't heard of it being used for such cases within the community."
AskNYC,fapxk7o,t3_e9idjs,1576294869.0,"I agree with the PT reference, is pretty useful. You can also try https://hellodowntime.com, they will search, call and book for you."
therapy,fapvmzc,t3_e9g5wk,1576294089.0,"psychologytoday.com has already been mentioned, it's a solid resource. This team; https://hellodowntime.com can search for a provider based on what you need and your situation, pretty cool.

Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fapuxfi,t3_e9ef04,1576293798.0,"Hey, you're taking great steps to being persistent in wanting to get help. As already commented, it would be worth it to have another conversation with your parents. Sorry to hear about your previous experience, there are providers out their who will be more aligned with what you need.

As for finding a provider, it's frustrating that there isn't more of an official list of resources, but I have recommended psychologytoday and hellodowntime as two great resources to help people get connected with a provider. The first is a great database with filters, the second is a service that searches, screens, and books a provider for you while giving you support. They have good reviews, give them a spin!

Good luck!"

loneliness,failtxi,t1_fafq86o,1576110981.0,"I'm thinking along the same lines as above, it might be worth potentially getting a consult from a physician for medication. And then search for a provider that can leverage a strategy that has the potential to generate better outcomes for you."
depression,fail9zb,t3_e9a1dw,1576110592.0,"Hey I hope you can get support soon! Don't give up the search for a therapist, are you already connected with a psychiatrist?"
Westchester,faikugx,t1_faiaw37,1576110290.0,"Fair enough, it's a novel approach to deploying CBT with the help of AI, developed by Stanford researchers. But I do understand your perspective.

Hopefully PT will be useful."
mentalhealth,fah31z4,t3_e8zqpk,1576078020.0,"Have you tried PsychologyToday? It's really useful and can help you draw a bead on a provider. Another service I regularly recommend is HelloDownTime, they can search and book a provider for you. DM me if you need more help!

Good luck!"
Westchester,fah2qpw,t1_fag9y1x,1576077809.0,"I'm glad CBT resonates with you, there are some apps you can try while you wait to start therapy. Two that I've read about recently; woebot and wysa. There are others out there that you can explore!"
BipolarReddit,faetz65,t1_facy6az,1576008133.0,"I second this. In addition, if you want a service that does the search and booking for you; https://hellodowntime.com. 

Good luck!"
NoStupidQuestions,faets38,t3_e8v9wv,1576008017.0,"When you're in therapy, you'll get a feel for the provider's approach. It might take some time but you should feel comfortable with their approach, philosophy, strategy, behaviour and so on. Therapists greatly vary so it might take a few trials but you definitely will land on someone you feel comfortable with!

I could recommend a couple of tools to help you search and filter, just DM me if you want resources.

Good luck!"
AskWomenOver30,fadxzmn,t1_fab2yeb,1575989231.0,"All those people who go in and out of relationships don't solely focus on one aspect of their (potential) partner, intimacy is great but not when it is viewed in shallow ways.

If you don't care about yourself (what you do, finance etc...), I could see it being a challenge for someone else to care and put energy into developing a relationship.

All the best"
