Cops are literally hunting down and harassing families at mere rumors of things like playdates or visiting parks. Some cities are flying drones to film citizens and/or play on repeat propaganda-like orders. Our governor has invested resources into neighborhood snitching groups rather than into fixing a broken, understaffed unemployment system that has left thousands without money for food and rent.

I don't mean to downplay what you're going through, and no one here can diagnose you without knowing more. But when it's an ED...you'll know. It will be unignorable and consume your entire life, and not just for a month or two of a diet. EDs can persist for years or lifetimes. Even when ""recovery"" seems like a reality, EDs have a sneaky way of reemerging during times of high stress. 

Get help now so it doesn't get worse. Confide in someone you trust, and find a therapist who specializes in these issues. Don't be disheartened if the first therapist you try isn't a good fit. Keep trying. And don't think therapy isn't worth the investment. Alternatives like hospitalization and long-term residential facilities will literally bankrupt you even *with* good healthcare."

EatingDisorders,flcyo9n,t3_fnnjn3,1585051513.0,"You're not alone, I've got over 20 years, and I'll be 31 in June. I was diagnosed with AN right before I turned 10 (it was a pretty extreme case). Hospitalized 3X, once at a long-term residential facility. Many people conceptualize and treat these disorders as adolescent ones. But they are with you (in some form) for life, and your triggers, symptoms, needs, etc. will change throughout developmental stages. I never imagined I would be struggling today. 

Just one piece of advice that I wish I could make *my* 25 year old self more seriously consider...If you're struggling with weight gain/recovery for your *own* sake (e.g. not realizing yet that you *deserve* happiness, or thinking that you're *only* hurting yourself), of course true wellness and healing *must* be for yourself. BUT, if it helps motivate you, consider how your health habits now are affecting the possibility of motherhood down the line. You don't know *now* what you'll want in several years. My soon-to-be-husband wants children, but I haven't had a period for over 3 years, and my hormones are all very low. Even if I can gain weight now, my disordered eating has likely done *irreversible* damage. I'm in no financial position for things like IVF, and I don't have time to wait given my age.

Even if I could give birth, how would my current attitudes towards food and negative body image affect my children? Having studied developmental psychology, I can tell you that children understand and are affected by *far* more than parents think they are. **Think about what you would tell a younger version of yourself, or your child, if you could. Would you be gentle and encouraging? Would you teach self-love?** **Try to think of recovery as treating yourself AND your** ***future*** **self like someone** ***worth*** **taking care of. Because you are.**

**And you're stronger than you know. You can grow** ***every*** **day. That's not just cheesy self-help positivity. Your brain is plastic and it will change as you work on negative thoughts and behaviors.**"
lehighvalley,fl0hx1x,t3_fhk9ib,1584706966.0,"Whoever told you that you would be able to find a furnished Lehigh Valley apartment for that price, and somewhere safe/clean, lied. My advice would be to stay out of the Allentown area altogether. The West End is nice, but that is mostly residential homes and not apartments. (You might be able to find a room for rent, but most nice apartments in the West End are owned by Muhlenberg College.)

I would look outside of Allentown closer to Bethlehem or Fountain Hill (or West to towns in the other directions). It's worth the commute. While Allentown is trying to boast a lot of new development in the form of apartments/lofts (and trying to fill those buildings with non-locals who don't know the area), I don't know of any for under $750, unless you can find roommates. And there are still lots of unsafe sections throughout the city. That may not be politically correct to say, but I grew up in this area, went to two colleges in Allentown, and have worked downtown."

And it's enjoyed by local bikers, runners (including the Lehigh track team), and families, of course. The road is also far too narrow to support the increased traffic. Has anyone reached out to Lehigh University or local environmental groups for their support?

Also, this developer Abraham Atiyeh seems like he's made a mess of plenty of other development projects in the LV. And he even previously fought against rezoning and development in his *own* neighborhood, arguing against increased traffic and decreased quality of life. But he's willing to bring those things to Hellertown, because it's not in *his* backyard. This is all about making a quick profit, not about caring for the land and adding value to our town.
