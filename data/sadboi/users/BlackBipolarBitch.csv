To be honest, I’m finding it hard to keep putting videos out consistently because of my depressive episodes. When I’m manic I’ll promise myself to film a bunch of content. But when I’m depressed I feel like “who will watch me?” “I’m not talented enough” “my ideas are dumb”
I’m trying really hard to find a balance. However, so fat the videos that I have uploaded have been doing pretty okay!"
