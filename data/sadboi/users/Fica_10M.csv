samsung,f8307mb,t3_dyiwkn,1574201642.0,Theme's are useless to me if you are using dark mode. I don't use Samsung keyboard or Samsumg messaging app. Gboard and TEXTRA so dark mode all around for me and also I love dynamic wallpapers.
Anxiety,f7zmzy8,t1_f7ypx4v,1574113098.0,Sometimes it can come handy and it won't affect me as much when I am stable. Just can't drink it consistently and and I just hate it takes 3-4 hours to wake up especially in crappy Iowa winter weather already
Anxiety,f7xskn9,t1_f7xqxq7,1574073250.0,In my opinion I think it does more bad than good.
Anxiety,f7xll9j,t3_dxmqso,1574062844.0,Perhaps and exactly how I felt litterly shortly afterwards. Did you get a flu shot by chance as well? I do know next year I am not getting it.
Anxiety,f7xhwrl,t1_f7xglkg,1574058252.0,That's how I feel like. Occasionally I can deal with it when I have good days but when I go week plus of major physical symptoms it just makes it worse. Another thing is I got flu shot about 2 weeks ago and my anxiety skyrocketed. Wonder if that messes with my already week immune system.
Anxiety,f7xfij7,t1_f7xdt5a,1574055619.0,I feel you. Sounds like we are in the same boat. I have been going through it for 7 years and here I am. I find valium to help because it's long lasting versus xanax fast relief for a bit. Valium does help with sleep and when I can get sleep I am much better. It's definitely frustrating but I have a family and I am not letting this get the better of me. I am at work right now and I have full blown anxiety attack but life does not stop. So stay strong and definitely get with Psychiatrist and try some medication. People with other illness take it so nothing wrong with that. Also very important with SSRI they will either be God sent or bust but you will never know until you try. Best of luck. I am taking caffeine out of my life and need to get as much sleep as possible.
Anxiety,f7xbp1h,t1_f7x6mr2,1574051887.0,I am on Valium and have been for 4 years and I also was on Klonopin. I take 5 mg twice a day. I have good days bad days and horrible days. Yeah sometimes I just don't even know what causes it otherwise I always have something going on just depends how severe it is. I personally tried multiple SSRIs and no go just can't get through even a week as they just make it 10 times worse.  Every body is different so definitely try it. It works wonders for people and I would not second chance it but it unfortunately does not work for me. Just way too sensitive.
Anxiety,f7x52te,t1_f7wyf9h,1574046485.0,Did you find anything that it helps you out?
Anxiety,f7w11zq,t1_f7vzgys,1574028838.0,Right that's how it's for me. I can handle it and effects after drinking are okay. However it messes with my sleep and also I have a lot of IBS so makes that worse.
Anxiety,f7ugku6,t1_f7u8ovt,1574014616.0,Yes unfortunately I will have to do it too. It's just not working out when we are nervous as it is.
Anxiety,f7tctoj,t1_f7t9ovq,1574003302.0,Yes coffee or energy drinks or anything caffeine it just gets my anxiety worse.
Anxiety,f7t06q1,t1_f7sztba,1573999805.0,I have tried decaf unfortunately it doesn't give me anything other than smell of coffee sort of. It's like we just can't win no matter what.
Anxiety,f7ssryw,t3_doz3zc,1573997938.0,"I feel the same way. Just lots of tension and on edge. Fatigue at random times. Headache, body aches mood changes, appetite all over, sleep issues and anything else you can think of. Then you catch a break and just wonder how nice must be to be normal and not have any of those issues. Anxiety disorder indeed is a monster."

galaxynote10,f6kkrl6,t3_drnun3,1572914087.0,I got this on my unlocked VZW a week ago and November security patch. I don't see improvement in image quality. Maybe a bit on HDR but nothing huge. Until they fix overexposure on people I am mainly using my Gcam mod.

galaxynote10,f5upmz2,t1_f5tlfd2,1572477254.0,They are a bit. However they are not smooth like on IOS. Also I hate that both Instagram and Snapchat do not use Note 10 camera but rather it's screen capture. It's total BS that they can't figure it out for Android because there is so many low end Android phone that would not be able to function and it has to do something with code.

galaxynote10,f4oz5v3,t1_f4o9zyp,1571711770.0,Where Google camera is superior is when people are involved. Either in regular or portrait Note will over expose your skin color. It will make black person white and on top of that it adds that smooth skin effect and personally to me it's cartoonish. Google camera give you more true to life image with a lot of contrast and sharpness. So if you like make up look then just stick with stock camera. I use both and sometimes I do find stock camera to actually take correct temperature picture. It depends on lighting condition and outside in bright day light is when it does worst. There is a lot to photography and also check out YouTube review where they explain what each camera does good and doesn't and then it just comes to preference sometimes.
samsung,ez8m8b2,t1_eiig98v,1567748463.0,You must disable put to sleep otherwise it will pause. That is what worked for me Note 10+
