depression,fexxwwg,t3_eqs4h8,1579438113.0,"I completely agree and this was a hard lesson I had to learn when I was younger (I'm 29 now and have had depression for 15 years). it's never going to completely go away and if it does die down for a bit, it will probably come back. life constantly throws challenges at you and it doesnt care if you're still learning to cope with past trauma or how far you've come since your last episode. 

one small tiny plus though is that as time goes on you do learn coping mechanisms. you get to know the signs. you realise which self destructive behaviors help and which ones you should probably avoid. 
no it isnt a cure and the depression still crushes all the same, but you often have a tiny bit more control in maintaining it so maybe it's less likely to spiral. or even just knowing which friend you can be honest with about it all. just as examples.

best of luck to you my friend. we're all surviving together x"
selfharm,feqb5ub,t3_eq9ket,1579339667.0,"that is so wonderful for you, you're so lucky. neither of my ex boyfriends understood at all. I'm currently going through a very hard time (having recently been broken up with) and I'm harming more than ever. im actually travelling in asia so I dont have a support network around me at all, except for a friend who I met on the road. I think he might be a bit in love with me tbh, but even though it freaked him out at first, he does the same as you said. he sometimes gives me a cuddle when I'm really down and runs his hand gently across the cuts on my ribs in a way that feels caring. it feels so good to finally feel.. accepted for coping in this way."
