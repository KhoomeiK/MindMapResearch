witcher,fpoqf0t,t1_fpoho3g,1588788874.0,"Okay, hope you don't mind me butting in a bit, because the bad ending as an argument came up many times. 

Some IRL experience, bear with me: grandfather was alcoholic & abusive. I never knew until he was dead & years later, when I was an adult, my mother talked about it. He beat my grandmother, shouted at her, and generally made life hell, while he was mostly sweet to the kids (still traumatizing for them, but that's another topic). My grandmother is still alive...and she misses him fiercely. NEVER (and I do mean never) brings up the bad memories, the abuse. Cries at his grave while tracing his name on the stone. 

It's easier to forgive somebody when they're dead. I imagine it's much the same when you're dying yourself, like Anna. The relationship between abusers and their victims can also be complicated in life, too - some people don't want to get away from their abusers because of it. Also, I don't think when others are saying ""she didn't deserve that, the Baron's horrible"", they mean that what she did isn't wrong or that he cannot be a complex character and feel remorse and guilt. Most abusers do."

Some of it comes with time and knowing your body and its limits, but it's always good to be cautious! Even non-epileptic people are advised to do these when sitting before a computer for extended periods of time, but here goes: take breaks, once every hour is ideal. Just get up for a few minutes and stretch. If your head starts hurting, not a good sign, probably shouldn't continue. And, when you say ""the whole day"", was it like 8 hours nonstop? More? Did you have breaks inbetween? Did you eat at regular intervals, were you hydrated, were you rested? Sleep deprivation can be one of the biggest triggers for some, but I was also advised to not do anything crazy with my blood sugar. (Not that I'm really good at taking care of myself, but haven't had a seizure for like 2 years so that's something!) Another trigger can be stress, which we seem to have plenty of lately. Also I'm sure you know that, but some, not all, people can be triggered by flashing lights - how relevant is that in your case?

Yeah, of course you shouldn't use mental illnesses as adjectives, as shown in your post. And a self diagnosis is not very likely to be right. But actual self diagnosis happens in the first place because someone is suffering, and they want to know why, and they can't see someone about it for whatever reason. Also, suicidal thoughts and self harm? It's very different, of course, when you had them for years (being suicidal for years especially leaves behind a way of thinking that can't be easily left behind), vs when you did it once, but I believe something's not quite right if somebody did it even just the once.

mentalhealth,flx5efq,t3_frgyia,1585575564.0,"I have this issue too, sort of. Most recently I saw a psychologist from September to, like, January or February, and then my mother recommended this theta healer person, and I kind of haven't seen either one since before the quarantine, and I really don't want a phone or Skype session either. 

But anyway; what I did was simply...tell her. I told her I'm having great difficulties in opening up, and I'll try to downplay it. I sometimes blurted out ""I don't know why I'm doing this awkward laugh, I don't feel good"". She said it's fine, there have been others with this problem before, and when something is up I can, in fact, tell her I don't want to talk about this, or bring up a topic we already discussed and feel like I explained wrong. 

I don't know about actually lying - the urge in me to please others and make them proud is really strong, but we need to stop that with therapists. Nothing comes to mind with this one, but I did outright lie to the psychologist I saw in freshman year of high school when he asked me if I had any suicidal thoughts. Obvious reasons. 

It helps a lot if you find someone you have chemistry with. Obviously they will not want to work based off conclusions other than stuff you tell them, that would be really unprofessional, but just someone you...vibe with, I guess? Someone it's hard NOT to trust? You know, in movies or something, those weird art teacher/hippie types who are so unapologically themselves that you feel no need to be ashamed to be yourself around them, either? Try to find one of those, only not an art teacher.

Editing to add because it sounds like I never do anything wrong...I don't so much lie as omit certain truths, grasp a conversation at different points and lead it my way, and phrase things a certain way so people will come to a different conclusion than the truth. (I know that sounds a bit frightening...) It's most likely a result of living with an emotionally abusive man in my preteens & teens."
selfharm,flqkxll,t1_flkfbku,1585398647.0,"Hey, it's alright. We're basically writing each other novels here. Recovery is very tricky and I wouldn't say I'm like, further along, but actually a book was a very big part of our story of moving away finally.  
I read ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft, and I told about it to my mom when they were after an argument. She bought and read it, and it took a while, but after that was the first time she called him ""abusive"".  
And it took another while to move out. It's mostly about partner abuse, and it was hard to read. I can't imagine what it has been like for my mother. And I definitely get that it's hard to put that ""label"" on yourself, so to speak. I saw the school counselor a few times after moving out, and she was like ""well, what brings you here?"", you know, as they are. And I know my stepfather was abusive. I know. I've read about it, I've lived through it, some of my friends knew. And I did this awkward smile and told her something along the lines of ""we didn't get on with him so well"".   
I was horrified at myself. We didn't \*get on\*? What the fuck? But I couldn't bring myself to say it at the moment. I just hoped she got what I meant.

But it also helps a bit to reach out to other survivors. Even if you feel like you don't ""qualify"" or something like that, especially then. Almost all of the stories begin like ""I know it's not as bad as others here, but..."". And sometimes it's comforting to know you're not alone with this whole mess -  not that I'm \*happy\* that others get panic attacks after breaking a mug, too, but you get me. Saying ""I was abused"" also means that a whole bunch of people will get you instantly without you having to write out the whole sorry mess. And maybe I should stop with the books, but it also does help to read about specific issues. Comfort eating, in my case, being one of them. One of those took me like a year to read. And also in fiction.

I'm lucky in the sense that I got to experience a childhood before this mess. I'm just glad we're both still here, it's no small feat. And nobody could get through this unscathed, and also I know it's going to take much longer until you stop blaming yourself. 

Good luck for the therapist hunt though! And as for the sexuality thing, I guess just try to be as honest as you can? I know it's hard, I have this whole thing with pleasing others and avoiding conflict, it can be hard to even identify my desires much less voice them. But I'm actually kind of talking to a girl online, right now, and I'm just freaking out a lot and I want to make her happy, but it's kind of fast for me, and also I told her I lean towards poly/open relationships, and she told me that wouldn't really work for her but we could try, but I don't even know if I want to even be in any relationship with her, I've never tried! I got through 20 years without a kiss! Ahh so I know it's confusing. But sometimes other than labels, maybe ""I'm into girls/boys too"" or ""I'm queer"", or ""I'm attracted to you, but I'm still kind of figuring out who else I'm attracted to""? If someone is an alright person, they'll get that.

Honestly that makes sense, but just because it's mostly sex you should still have boundaries probably? I get wanting to balance things out but if there are three people in your bedroom, the sex is about the three of you, and everyone should ""get"" something out of it and whatever. I've never been in that situation but make sure you're not actually being viewed/viewing yourself as something only to ""spice things up"", you're still a person with your own desires. And if you're casual with them, they should still totally understand wanting to have a romantic thing - they have their own, so why not you? I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record probably but it would work better if you talked about this with them :D

Yeah, not saying that category is to be avoided entirely, but especially with the behavior you described you could not figure out something is wrong until it's too late. One of the best ways to tell is how they react to you setting boundaries and saying no, so if you don't do that it's gonna be hard. Just take care.

If they're interested in your mental health you could open with that? That you wanted to show them trust by downloading this but your parents used the same thing and it's freaking you out and maybe you could just text them where you are. Or I'm guessing you're staying more at home now, considering the situation... I think it's normal to be worried, I'm sure my parents are too, but don't always voice it unless it's a special case like the party after prom in the city centre, or a whole night out (which is rare for me). It might have something to do with  them being law enforcement and seeing a lot of bad stuff I guess, I try to  minimize my dealings with law enforcement, so I can't really help you there :D

Ohhh the rough sex is a fine line to walk. I think I'm actually into that, so I know it can be weird seperating the desire to self harm (because of  addiction/desire to be punished/whatever?) and the desire for someone to tie me up and whip me (and it's not precisely coming from the same place, and I haven't been physically abused other than the occasional slap and kick, and I'm sure not buying into the weird ""anti-kink"" or whatever crowd that I don't know what's good for me and it's just another form of self-harm). But I'm fairly sure it's...really, really different if you don't actually enjoy it. Probably should find a therapist who's experienced in this stuff?

Questions that bring more questions! I think recovery is constant, it probably already begun when you were still there, your body and mind trying to repair the damage done with (perhaps bad, but still) coping methods. It was trying to keep you alive and well best as it could. We're probably never going to be models for healthy behaviour, and we shouldn't beat ourselves up for that. Non-survivors get to have a few unhealthy coping methods and ""guilty pleasures"", like, cigarettes, maybe cake? There's always going to be setbacks, but as long as you go on, you're recovering. Even if you don't feel like going on, and just lie in bed, or relapse, or don't wash your hair for weeks, or feel like you're a wrong step away from killing yourself, that's recovery, along with the better days.

I just try to find anything that makes me emotional, then. Anything I would \*like\* to have, or do, or whatever. I would like to own a painting from one of my favourite artists someday. I see myself waking up in the same bed as somebody else, or two somebodies. I would like to knit that stupid ""I'm a luxury few can afford"" sweater. I would like to play some guitar. I would like to bake so many chocolate chip cookies, even though I'm nervous in kitchens. I would really like to buy a dildo in one of those weird colours. I want to get into playing Dungeons and Dragons. I may not be capable of having longer term goals just yet, but this is also recovery, on my own terms, and everybody else who doesn't know what is going on in my head can shut up about the subject. Ya know. 

And I'm really glad if I could help! I know it's all weird and scary and lonely as fuck, and even convincing yourself that you're worth it is hard. Just try to go on, literally, there is no magic secret, unfortunately. Maybe don't be afraid to ask for help, don't be afraid to say that you feel horrible, that it was horrible, and consume a lot of art. I know it's really fucking cliche, to the point I roll my eyes at it sometimes, but you're not alone. If you reach out, sometimes someone will reach back. Not all is lost.  ♥️"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,flqf47n,t3_fqaw6a,1585392118.0,"Okay, I'm not even sure where to begin. There is no way to fail at being a woman! These ""you're not TRULY a woman until/unless..."" (and the ""you're not TRULY a man..."" too) things are all fucking fake! If there was a way to fail at being a woman, my not-shaving, not-bra-wearing, men's-cologne-buying, faded-knitted-sweaters wearing ways would probably be that. (And also my hair is a weird mess that is currently more growing outwards than downwards, but that is whatever.) These things you mentioned are only a problem if they're bothering you. Okay, possibly the nail thing could be a problem, if they're chipping so much you might have a vitamin deficency, but I'm not like, an expert on that.

If you're real worried about the hair find a good hairdresser - my mom has really soft, thin hair, and the ends always used to get thin and ""chip away"" (however you say it in English...) whenever it got long enough to brush her shoulders. She sees the hairdresser after 3 weeks usually for dyeing, and she mentioned that she'd like to grow it longer, and she recommended some professional products, and guess who has now hair that brushes her shoulder blades. But there's nothing wrong with having it in a pony tail? I did that usually when it was still long, it gets in the way, it's normal! 

You don't really need to be good at EVERYTHING makeup, I think? We're not models, and makeup is not like, for hiding your face. You just figure out a few things that you like and that work for you, and that you can be bothered to do, there are lots of different face/eye/whatever types. I only do makeup rarely, and usually it's only foundation, sometimes contour, and eyeliner and/or eyeshadow if I have the time. Find good tutorials, I think, and if you're in quarantine, now is a good time to practice :) You probably don't need to spend so much on it though, some brands you get in drugstores work perfectly fine.

Your body is trickier. It's a journey. I have acne, I'm short and stocky (imagine a female hobbit, but with small feet), I have self harm and other scars, I'm weird all over too. You can exercise, diet, build muscle, be thinner or more fat, you can get surgery nowadays. But you can't do any of this with hate. Well, I guess you *can*, but it's not going to be very effective. I'm still learning this. To love my weird hobbit-body. To love it like I would a friend - I would never dream of loving one of my friends less if they gained or lost a few pounds, or had scars, or cellulite, or if they got surgery to have pointy ears like elves, or wore contact lenses with hearts in them, or if they looked like the Phantom of the Opera in the book. It wouldn't even factor in! And I know it's really hard not to give into the narrative that if you're not thinking of yourself as ugly at any given moment, you're being vain, but that's just not true. You don't need to carry all this weight. You can just exist. 

I'm sorry this got so long, but I guess it's just an emotional subject for me. Wish I could just give you a hug though. I know how much this sucks."

Is he a ""bad boy"" in a sense that he actually practices critical thinking even about stuff society considers obvious, and maybe is looking a little rugged, motorcycle, leather jacket, metal, the works, or is he a ""bad boy"" in a sense that he has problems with toxic masculinity and is controlling, violent and getting involved with him could get you into an abusive situation again? (Watch out for the signs with girls too, but that ""bad boy"" type is a minefield.)

Huh. About your aunt & uncle. Doing that GPS thing sounds like a bad idea. I don't know about you, but sometimes I get really freaked out if anybody tries to monitor or control me, and it could backfire. And also I feel you with the ""comparing"", my dad remarried also and my stepmom has three kids, all older than us, and their bio dad was also abusive and an alcoholic. Whenever she brings that up it's never like in a tone of ""I know what you feel"" but more like ""I had to endure THAT and here I am and you got yelled at a little and you're a mess years later"" (implied, obviously). The kids are ok, but I always get compared to them like they could find their way even if they had to search for a while, and they were always enthusiastic...God. Thing is, you didn't have a normal upbringing or loving parents or whatever, and even people who had that could behave ""pretty weird"" if they had mental health issues. And I think this varies from person to person, and maybe in a sense my parents know that I'm too scared for anything crazy, but they literally only know my friends from my stories. We live in a smaller town near to a big city, and I don't know anybody from town and usually when there's not a global pandemic and I'm not self isolating I spend most of my time in the city anyway. They know their names and they can associate with them the stories I tell, and maybe they met them on school things? I have no idea, but I didn't have to drag anybody to the house to introduce themselves. Then again this could vary from household to household.

To be honest, as you can see, I have no idea what a ""molly"" is and whatever, so I can't help you a lot with that. But think about what you would actually like (which, I know is harder than it sounds, because the safest answer for so long was ""nothing""), and know that in sex work you can, actually, have boundaries. Like a condom. Or get tested very often and require that from regulars if you actually like that. Just because they're paying you doesn't mean you have to do anything they ask for. And get on birth control maybe. And think about what you want from your triad/threesome/significant others. Anyway, sex and other stuff if you're not into it can be absolutely used for self harm, so it's not just cuts… God I really really hope I could say some things that are maybe useful. Recovery SUCKS and I HATE it, but it's...worth it. Sometimes. I'm not very confident myself. And also getting commited, while I know sounds scary and some places are disgusting, is not always a bad thing. I went to this theta healer person recently (don't ask me, my mom believes in this stuff), and she actually recommended a psychotherapy place which is like, a month inpatient thing. And I actually considered it. It's a bit different for me; I only really started caring about my (not) wellbeing because I draw and dance and sing and act and am generally all over the place. Usually. My mental health is interfering with the artistic process and I feel like I don't have anything to be alive for because I can't DO anything and that is literally the only reason I care about myself right now. But I guess everyone has to start somewhere. Stay alive and good luck xx"
selfharm,fkya9ec,t3_fl9nk2,1584644737.0,"Alright, hi! You remind me a lot of myself in some aspects. I'm 20F and after a divorce from my dad (dad's cool at least) my mom remarried and we lived with an abusive asshole for like 6 years. Not as bad as others, but, like, pretty bad. We moved away just before my 18th birthday. My brain has as many holes as...a hole-y cheese, so forgive me if my reply is a bit rambling or I leave something out. 

Okay, so, first of all, nobody expects you to be like, you're in a bad situation one day, so you feel bad, but you're in a good situation the next day so you feel good. This shit leaves SCARS. There are a lot of stuff that comes up that you were repressing and didn't even know you were doing that at the time, but if you start feeling safe your body is gonna be like ""welp! guess we can stop bottling it up now!"" and you're going to feel so horribly and you're going to be like what the FUCK, everything is FINE now! You're actually processing that stuff you couldn't because you were busy surviving. Yeah, I know, fucking hell.

And also, about feeling like a fraud? On these subs, a lot of the time the people asking for help and the people doing the helping are the same. It goes around. Also, healing is not linear, there are days when you feel so good you can't possibly imagine why you wanted that therapy in the first place, and days so bad you can barely get out of bed and you have a panic attack when you hear footsteps outside your door and you go ""what the fuck, I thought I was past this!"".

And, like, we mostly see this in adopted children, but I'm pretty sure adults do this, just more subtly. Maybe you're actually trying to find your aunt's and uncle's ""breaking point""? Subconsciously. It's very common; victims of abuse are trying to see if and when the new people they're with turns out to be abusive too, or neglecting, or whatever they're used to, because however much you know your new situation is much better, you're probably also freaking out a bit. I know. I'm freaking out too. And also sometimes you're only doing some dumb stuff because you have the freedom to do it? I'm too scared to like, rebel, I'm just really relieved I can get shitty haircuts without anybody yelling at me about it, and drink my coffee with sugar without being called a fat cunt. Ya know.

Also suicidal thoughts leave these...pathways in your brain, also? Like an instinct. You're going about your day and you encounter a minor problem and your brain goes ""we wouldn't have to deal with this if we were dead!"" and it's very unsettling, but sometimes if you can't feel like you're actually suicidal anymore it's only because your brain got used to that kind of thinking. I hope I'm making sense here because I read about this stuff a lot but probably can't remember everything correctly (reading about it also helps but is fucking hard). The inability to make plans for the future might also come from that. I can't really answer the ""how do you imagine yourself in 5 years?"" because, the first answer my brain screams at me is ""dead probably"", even when at that moment I wasn't feeling like that and then I start to spiral...So it's a very, just survive these ten minutes, this hour, this day kind of thing, slow going. And I have an idea taking care of yourself, honoring your wishes was kind of last priority in your household, so there's that. Childhood abuse can make you very mature and polite and accomodating (a lot of what you're describing) and that can help you as a child, but actually hinder you as an adult. Fun stuff. But please don't take ANY of the blame from that, that's on your parents.

Also, like, tell me if I go overboard with this, but a lot of the stuff you're doing sounds like...you're not always doing ""bad stuff"", just ""stuff that's supposed to be bad"". I'm thinking the casual sex and the sex work. And while we're here, there's nothing wrong with being a sugar baby but it IS generally considered sex work, it is very demanding, and if sex work is illegal where you live probably sugaring is illegal too. There can also be backwards laws, so look it up, protect yourself, whatever. It's also not like, a bad or immoral thing to do, and sugar babying is actually the kind of sex work to NOT do if you're desperate for money, so you're good on that front. But I actually have no idea about what could happen if you tell that and the drugs to a therapist, again, depends a lot on your location and I also haven't had to deal with that in particular yet.

Also, yay bisexuality. I had that particular crisis when I was 12 (probably not as rough as you as I'm not a Christian and also from a not-particularly-homophobic family), now I'm having the crisis about polyamory. I can't actually tell you if you're bisexual or not, and I guess a more accurate label for me would be pansexual (because non-binary people exist and I'm fine with whatever), but some people use those interchangeably, and more people know what bisexual means. If you're attracted to men and women, though, you're probably bisexual, but be aware anyways it's not like, 50-50, men-women all the time. It's fluid, at least for me. And being, like, 95-5 is just as ""valid"". Also! On the topic of relationships! I think your triad (?) sounds healthy enough, other than you not being able to tell them some things. People are usually against age gaps in relationships/friendships because there could be a power imbalance, even unintentionally; like the older person patronizing the younger, the younger being unable to view themselves as the partner's equal and instead viewing them like a teacher or a superior...I'm not saying it can't work, just needs talking and thinking about. Also, there's always going to be unusual partnerships in your life; one of the people I love most dearly is my old high school psych teacher. Who wasn't actually /my/ teacher, we acted together in the school drama club. He's around 60. So, just because somebody is older/younger, doesn't mean you can't be friends/partners! Just watch out for these things. And maybe don't go overboard, don't constantly psychoanalize yourself after a while, don't become obsessed if anything you do is considered healthy. Yeah, right now you probably need to think about it more than most, but sometimes you just gotta Do The Thing (As Long As You're Not Hurting Anybody).

It's not a competition. Whatever your reasons, you're suffering, and even if you don't feel like you have it bad enough - it would be a lot easier if we would seek help before it gets ""bad enough"". It's been almost nine years for me, I think.

I have known such people. You want to be understanding, and kind, but you just can't figure out what their deal is and why are they like that, and you're probably also dealing with a fuckton of stuff on your own already. 
He may just be obnoxious, or trying to appear cool, or genuiely trying to figure out his identity. I have no idea. But I'm a firm believer that anyone hurting themselves like that needs help. 

And this is all very personal, however much he's trying to bring attention to himself; I think being a metal fan is something of an identity to some people. Religion is not something you usually figure out in your high school years - at least, not completely. (Far as I can tell, he has some misinformation about being a satanist, too.) 

And scars and wounds...that's something that's different for everyone. I have relapsed a while ago, but I only have faint scars on visible places, and I never bother with hiding them anymore. It gets tiring. It's a part of your own body - you get to decide whether to show it or not, and how to feel about it. There is no wrong way to dealing with them, and also - if you're down enough, you just stop caring after a while. No mask can be worn all the time, forever (especially one you craft when you're a teenager). I went to an art school, and one year I held my friend as she was crying and breaking down in the corridor after a school event. Literally right beside us, a boy from one of the lower classes was much in the same situation. (I guess February is just Like That.) I coaxed her to eat, to drink, and we got going, and she broke down again not twenty minutes later in front of a street performer in the metro. She sat down on the ground and we listened to the guy and when we finally parted ways I just hoped that I was doing the right thing, letting her go. 
(I was. She's okay as you can be with a mental illness. That's not how this story ends.) 

I'm sorry this got so long. Just...know he's probably struggling, too, and have some compassion. He's not your responsibility - if he's annoying or you simply don't want to talk to him, avoid him. You have no obligation to this guy - we all have our burdens, but that doesn't entitle us to put them on others. Just know it's not so black and white."

Therapy can also give you the strength you need to get out eventually, and give you the tools to cope after (because it is so worth getting out, but you will totally freak out because of repressed stuff you didn't even know you were repressing).

Have you ever met any ""fake"" LGBT+ people? How do you know someone is fake? Why the heck would someone fake this?

What I did (that worked): an awesome person on Answers HQ suggested it to a similar-but-not-quite-the-same issue,[I really hope linking it is okay?](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Origin-Client-Web-Technical/Origin-no-longer-launches-cannot-update-and-crashes/td-p/8629995)

Basically: clear Origin's cache (there's a tutorial on EA's help website). Do a ""clean uninstall"" of Origin, using Revo Uninstaller. Restart the computer. Download and install the full Origin launcher, run as administrator. I tried starting a game immediately - so far so good, and I tried after I quit and logged back in - success again! Leaving this here, because I really hope it holds, and also when I was searching, I found sooo many people having problems with Origin it's crazy.

Update: should have knocked on wood...The Sims 3 isn't working again. Same issue as before with the ""play"" not doing anything...Other games work now, though, and Origin itself launches just fine. I'm beginning to hate it with a passion though. I don't even know if this should stay ""solved"", it's kind of halfway...

Update, again: I did knock on wood after last time, but the whole thing is back to the way it was, ""update required"" and all that. Guess it is time to hit costumer service."

I dreamed about my family members finding my personal blog. I dreamed I found someone to have fun sexytimes with, just for them to leave me alone, bleeding, immediately after.

You didn't choose this, she, however, chose to have you and that means caring for you and loving you, whatever happens. 
It's not like you could wear diapers for 6 months! It's not okay she even made you wear them in the first place. The fucking couch can get fucked as opposed to your dignity. Things can be cleaned, they can be replaced, the floor can be mopped up. If she fucks up the relationship between you that is not something you spot-clean or get repaired or buy a replacement for. 

Sorry if that was a bit of a rant...I can't imagine trying to justify this to myself?! I wish I had some practical advice. A quick Google search revealed something called an ""incontinence pad"", it's waterproof and washable, and it's quilted. It's mostly marketed for the elderly and also not very cheap, but definitely better than plastic sheets. Maybe you could convience her to invest in some and use that for bed and the couch?

I know my brain is stupid, and I get caught up in myself, and I know my threshold will be much lower on some days. It's not really a constant thing that I miss now, though, yeah, obviously lower points bring it out, and the random patches of self-loathing or just wanting to be hurt for no apparent reason. 

But there's a lot of times now, that I don't think about how I could hurt myself with this when wielding anything sharp. When the kitchen knife is really just a kitchen knife.

He needs to listen to his body, get enough water, not do extremes with his blood sugar levels (regular meals lol), and of course -- sleep. My body's need for sleep is through the roof, though that could also be tied to mental health stuff. 

Stress could also be a trigger for some, and you're gonna have to tread carefully until you know which triggers he has. He has to basically re-learn his body, nd very throughly at that. His neurologist is right that seizures triggered by flashing lights are not that common - they do happen, but even then I think fireworks are probably fine? I don't think it's flashing bright/fast enough to be a problem, but I can't say for sure. 
Anyway, I never had a problem on a ride either, but I'm probably not much help because I was on like two of them my whole life, said nope, and I'm even scared of (closed) water slides lol. But I don't know if the excitement/fear of the thing is enough to be a worry there. 

Also, I don't know if others had this, but during my EEG I had different stressors introduced (flashing lights were one and some kind of audio clip was other) with increasing intensity. They asked me afterwards which one I felt like I had problems with, and I said lights I think, bc I was feeling really uncomfortable with that part, and they said that's strange, because from my brain waves, I'm lucky I didn't have a seizure during the whole audio thing. (Or the other way around, who the hell remembers.) So that could give you a clue.

When I was younger and in my prime I really liked 'Suicide Room', but I'm plain too scared to watch it again. 
I think about 'Cloud Atlas' a lot - it has that one character in it, can you tell I'm starved for representation? It's a great book+movie anyways. 
Also, Grantaire from 'Les Miserables'! He's an alcoholic and only slightly unstable in the source material, but I'm really into fanfiction and everyone loves to make him suffer and project all our horrible stuff onto him.
