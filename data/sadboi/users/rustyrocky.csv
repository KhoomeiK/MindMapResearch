To your point on your tooth issue. Don’t let it fester, this type of thing is considered essential surgery or medical in most places. Exhaust your options, then exhaust more options. You should not be on antibiotics that long, I’m sure you know it’s not the best solution. Ask for a referral to a specialist that’s doing stuff still. 

Yeah, you are unlikely to die, but oral health is serious stuff and if an infection happens that can lead to severe complications including stroke and other stuff. Yes it’s rare, especially since you are on antibiotics, but I highly encourage you to see what other options exist. 

I should be clear, I don’t think your cavity will kill you. However tooth and gum infections have killed people I know and or seriously fucked them up. You’re on antibiotics, so you’re not going to have that issue, but antibiotics suck to take long term. All the above said, I assume your dentist knows what’s the right course of treatment and if you had a major risk they would make something happen, so don’t worry over some very irritating pain.

You’d likely use better input data by using radar or another sensor range to check density of the limbs and while mapping the tree. 

Then you would be told the best places for the cuts for desired outcome. 

It is stupidly simple actually."

I’m self employed and work from home, and will continue to go out for coffee in the morning and lunch/dinner as I feel like.

HongKong,fgj5k6p,t1_fgh7spx,1580837395.0,"The research aspect is always hand hygiene and masks. However if you compare those studies to just hand hygiene you may be surprised to learn the studies you’re citing as mask studies are really hand hygiene studies plus the relatively unnecessary mask. 

Nothing you have linked has demonstrated that masks are worth wearing out and about. 

The two things I said around usefulness that you are trying to use as contradictory are actually complimentary. 

As I’ve been trying to explain and expose the entire time, the studies you are using to inform your opinion are not proving your opinion true. They do not make your argument whatsoever as they are not studying the scenario we are debating. 

I am not suggesting any of your studies to be wrong.  

Hand washing is proven to be insanely effective at keeping people healthy. 


I want to be clear. I have never come across a study that has meaningful data to support your point. If there was, I would use that to support your point. I had the same understanding as you do about these masks until a few people explained to me why my understanding was not supported by current data. 

All of that said, masks should not make your chance of sickness worse, so if it only gives people a positive placebo and particulate filtration. It also worries me that most people thing masks are more useful than they are. 

I feel like I should add, our discussion Is about the topic and not against each other. I received a threat on reddit today and it’s making me a bit more aware my tone may not always be the best. I’m also on mobile so my posts will never be as beautifully formatted and easy to follow."
