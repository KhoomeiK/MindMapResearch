Cbds imo are only really good for very mild physical pain management and even then id suggest bayer or advil instead because its not very effective for most pain management. Its more of a supplement. 

Weening off cannabis is definitey harder with a mental condition such as ptsd because youll be even more prone to irritability and sleeplessness than you already are. But this should pass within a week and youll be back to your normal amount of irritability and sleeplessness in no time. :p"
