I also stay in a workbase dorm (though I‚Äôm not workbase) where students who have finished the program stay while they work, so they have a free ride and stay rent free while they just make their money. One student here is a CNA who completed it in 45 days and she just works.

Of course you‚Äôre going to ‚Äúhave feelings‚Äù for him, but start to understand that you don‚Äôt deserve this treatment from anyone; especially if it‚Äôs someone that is supposed to love and care for you. It sounds a lot like he views you more like his property rather than his partner. These ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù can start to subside when you come to realize he doesn‚Äôt deserve them from you. It‚Äôs a painful process to let go, I know, but if he‚Äôs willing to treat you like that, you‚Äôre not losing anything in this.
