SuicideWatch,f6achxw,t3_dj4nrp,1572754932.0,If you ask anyone I’m the “happiest little social butterfly” I can’t go one day without thinking if I could just die I could breath and live. I can’t say this without sounding crazy. I’ve always loved life and had a lot of friends and literally was just a ball of sunshine. Over the past 4 years slowly I’ve become the most negative person I can’t even stand to be around myself. I can be happy for everyone besides myself. The only thing that genuinely makes me feel happy is making other people feel loved and laughing. All I do is give and I can’t do it anymore. I’m exhausted of panic attacks and running around like crazy throwing rocks and smashing shit.
