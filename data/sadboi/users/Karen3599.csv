As a former psych nurse, I was privy to watching our local institution shutter for good and send it‚Äôs last patient to our facility-a crisis unit. Basically, we were told, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your problem, you handle it now.‚Äù I live in Florida, where we spend in absolute last dollars, for mental health. In fact, our state is ranked just about last, nationally, in spending for mental health. It‚Äôs no joke that ‚ÄùFlorida Man‚Äù exists. The amount of mental illness running wild and free, here, should be a lesson learned when our elected officials are only concerned with lining their own damn pockets and not doing the job they were elected to do.  It never ceases to amaze me why mental health, as well as dental, vision, are not considered part of the whole of a person."

To her, I‚Äôm only being ‚Äúuncooperative, selfish and a liar‚Äù if I tell her it‚Äôs mine. She will eat food like someone‚Äôs about to take it from her, all the while chomping away with her mouth open, dropping food onto her chest while doing it. It‚Äôs pretty disgusting to go out to dinner with her although she manages to become somewhat appropriate out in public.    She CONSTANTLY BELCHES AFTER EATING, also. Could you imagine going out to dinner and dealing with that? She‚Äôd have beaten my ass as a child, for acting this way. Pretty interesting considering that at home, she just ‚Äúloves to press my buttons‚Äù and eat like swine. She has dentures and is constantly complaining that they are loose, yet won‚Äôt get them fixed. She loves Werthers candies and eat handfuls of them, all the while rolling them around in her open mouth, with them clicking against her teeth. She does this deliberately  to get me to leave the area so she doesn‚Äôt have to listen to ME complaining about her disgusting food habits.

I‚Äôm not a big fan of blasting children into next week with antipsychotics, but sometimes you got to do what you have to. Have you spoken with her psych dr for alternatives with less side effects? There may be a few out there that don‚Äôt have the side effect profile that Depakote does. Neurontin seems to be decent with helping emotional lability (roller coaster of emotions, uncontrolled) but she MUST continue therapy to recognize when the anger starts rising, to becoming checked out. I do understand she refuses to take Ativan, but somewhere here, you probably see she‚Äôs ready to go off the rails. Can any deals be made with her that if she feels like going off the rails, would she take 1/2 a tab, instead a whole one, to stop the rage from becoming uncontrolled? I bet if there was an agreement made between the 2 of you, it might work and would help her avoid going into full blown rage. I imagine it‚Äôs very painful to watch, let alone her feeling this way. It might help her to understand that keeping in the here and now ie: taking 1/2 Ativan when she can identify it coming on, rather than losing it, would help all involved. I also allowed my little psych patients to start recognizing when they‚Äôd feel a rage come on, let them go to their room and beat a pillow and scream until exhausted. Scream into the pillow and not in the room...lol Good luck and God bless."

I mean, WTF LADY? Just because I don‚Äôt agree with everything you say, I‚Äôm being disrespectful? Narcs are pretty unbelieveable and impossible to deal with. I had recently been thinking about going to a different pain mgt dr.  My nmother recently went to her drs appt (pain mgt also) and blathered about MY physical health to the PA. Told the PA all about my health, meds I take, and cannabis that I smoke on occasion to help pain. i got pissed and said she no right to talk about my shit to anybody, let alone these people. She laughed at me and said that it was no big deal. I reminded her that it was a HIPPA violation to just talk about other peoples health issues. She still didn‚Äôt get it and she was an RN for 50+ yrs."

After disinfecting your clothes,  Please eat, even if it‚Äôs just soup and Gatorade, take a hot as hell  shower, some Ibuprofen and try to get rest. Some self-care is sorely needed right about now. God bless toots!"

raisedbynarcissists,flu1iif,t3_fqxkvl,1585493068.0,"Same thing happened with my Nmom about a six weeks ago. She said I should move, I told her NO I won‚Äôt be going anywhere and to stop threatening me with it, since she‚Äôd have to PAY for an EVICTION. All this prefaced with me telling her she‚Äôs a malignant narc who takes my belongings as her own, gaslights me at every turn and puts me down regularly. I wish I could leave, but I suspect it won‚Äôt be too much longer for her. She was just diagnosed with heart failure and was surprised/upset about it. My thoughts are you can‚Äôt be 300+ lbs most your adult life and expect your heart to maintain decent performance. Trust, I wanted to tell her that but I‚Äôd end up being pummeled. I‚Äôm 56 yrs old btw...."

MorbidReality,flkytp0,t1_flkv96l,1585250288.0,"Until the mentally ill break into someone‚Äôs home, (ie:politicians)little do they understand. It would have taken quite a bit of oversight and money to have institutions continue to operate. Better than releasing everyone onto the damn streets to fend for themselves. Sad isn‚Äôt it. Both my mother and I worked in mental health (she worked during de-institute) and as we talked about our experiences, weren‚Äôt  different from one another. This would be a 30 year difference between her and I. That is so unbelievably ridiculous that as a supposed ‚Äúprogressive society‚Äù we can‚Äôt seem to consider mental health as part of overall HEALTH. Include dental and vision into that. Somehow that‚Äôs not a frigging necessity either. God don‚Äôt get me started....lmao, thanks for your reply."
