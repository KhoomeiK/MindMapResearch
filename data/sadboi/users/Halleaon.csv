We knew mom was sick but no one really told us she was dying and for the last few weeks we weren't even allowed to see her. The day she died me and my sister were in school. She died at 8 in the morning and no one  told us until 2:30 that afternoon. We were completely blindsided because we didn't know how sick she was. I still get angry thinking about it because we never got a chance to say good bye or come to terms with what was going to happen. It's one of the single greatest regrets I have that she died without us having seen her for weeks before hand. It feels like we got robbed somehow of that little bit of time. Fuck cancer. I don't know how old your kids are, but if I may suggest it, don't make the same decision my parents did. Don't hide what's happening from your kids at the end to try to spare them.

AskReddit,ff4qhu8,t3_erhu3x,1579570004.0,"Had a dream where the earth underwent another great war, only this time it was so bad even the non-humans made themselves known.

 There were three factions; the green faction full of people that believed the earth should be allowed to regrow it's forests and erase all trace of mankind except those that could live in harmony with the earth. the second group was the red faction, that was full of psychotic masochists out to kill everyone and everything that moved. and the black faction, that were mostly trying to just survive and had both humans and non-humans (vampires, demons and the rare werewolf)

In the dream I had been forced to undergo a trial in a alternate universe that had the ability to look upon all the infinite universes and see the outcomes of all choices through all time. I was supposed to be sent to one of the parallell worlds and survive for 3 days. 

I got dropped in the three-factioned version of earth in the remains of an underground building full of people that had been infected with some sort of parasite that took over their minds and made them act like raging people-eating psychos.

 I'm standing there, wondering wtf is going on and a group of people in the black faction run up and spray paint my side with black paint 'declaring' that I'm now part of their faction. (apparently that's how they induct new people, whether they want to be inducted or not). I get dragged out of the tunnels back to their base.

 I spend the next 2 days going on patrols with them 'under supervision' to get supplies and prove my worth and become tentative friends with this vampire guy who's pretty high ranking but is something of a loner (i get the impression in the dream that he either wants to seduce me or feed on me, possibly both so i keep him at a safe distance). on the third day he, i and the rest of my 'squadron' are sent into the tunnels for more supplies, we get to this hallway with a room at the end and there's 6 of the parasitic inside.

There's no way our group can fight them, we'd all die. the parasitic have superhuman strength and speed. So  i  yell for the others to get out of there, planning to sacrifice myself. the vampire guy throws me a look but nods and runs with them to get them out, and I stay to fight the parasitics. I fight them like some sort of badass,I  knock out all 6 after a long hand-to-hand combat type of battle and out of nowhere a big baddie, apparently the leader of the parasitics, who's the bald middle-aged guy with the persona of hannibal lector shows up, out of nowhere and grabs me, I can't get free and he's about to put one of those parasites in my head via the back of my neck and I wake up.

AskReddit,fek5z2u,t3_epkm4j,1579193312.0,"As someone who's chosen to be alone for my entire adult life:You get to be you. The unadulterated you . you don't have to worry about other people's opinons or schedules, you don't have to worry about how someone else is going to react or treat you. Everything you own is yours and something you chose, right down to the food in your fridge. You don't have to edit yourself.  You get to find out who you are and if some day you change your mind and decide to let someone else in, you're in a better position because you know who you are, what you want and whoever loves you will do so because of that. You don't get lost in them and end  up someone you dont' want to be, because you are capable of standing on your own."

AskReddit,fdrzj7y,t3_emxi47,1578692059.0,"When I was 14 my twin sister tried to kill herself. (We're 36 now.)She'd taken a bottle of asprin and I was the only other person home, she came into my room afterwards and told me what she'd done. I panicked, grabbed the phone, and rather than calling 911 myself, I handed it to her and told her she needed to take responsibility for her actions and made her call 911 herself and explain what she'd done. I still regret that, I should have called myself, but I panicked and it was the first thing that came into my head. I've since realized my mind goes into what I call 'fix it' mode in panicky situations, where I just automatically become very logical and react without emotion rather than flipping out. I'm sure there's a usefulness to that. But I still feel regretful about it. She's fine by the way. She lived and now is grown up, married and has a kid."
DnD,fdry59d,t3_emwykz,1578691417.0,"our group got wishes from our dm once and most of them chose riches or something similar. I didn't and it was the best decision ever. I requested a red cape, that when worn would heal the entire party for the amount of damage I did over an enemy's remaining HP on a final blow. IE if I killed a goblin or whatever and was the one to inflict the killing blow and the goblin had 3 hp left and I hit it for 5 damage, the entire party would be healed by 2 hp. That cloak saved us more times than I can count. It also helped that i was a swashbuckler and was usually the one to do the killing blow. It was called Ren's cape of healing.

offmychest,fdrm01f,t3_emvwes,1578686383.0,"I realize that it is likely a cultural thing with your mom wanting to choose someone for you to marry, but honestly, don't let her push you into doing something that you don't want to do or that's going to make your life unpleasant. It's your life, you are the one that has to live it and someday when you're at an age where you're parents are no longer around you don't want to be stuck living the life they chose for you. Also, don't let her guilt you into anything, no matter how upset she says she is, or if she threatens to leave the country or kill herself or whatever, she's not going to actually do it. it's just a way of expressing how upset she is and trying to get you do agree to what she wants. Don't fall for it. be firm but understanding and hold your ground. Remember that your mother does not have the right to ask you to live your life her way. No matter how much you love each other, no matter if she raised you, she does not have that right, no one does. Your life is yours, your happiness is yours. Don't give up on what you want to please other people, it's not worth it. Also remember, you don't have to explain yourself. Chances are if you try to say it's because of depression or whatever else she will try to use it against you or minimize how you feel in some way to get you to change your mind. One of you has to be the adult here, if she won't behave like one, then you will have to. Hold onto what you want and what makes you happy, because no one else will do it for you. Best of luck."

I kid you not, the gallstone was the worst. I literally could not stand up and had to crawl to my kitchen to get to a phone. I spent the next 5 hours heavily medicated in the ER while they did an MRI and other tests to confirm if I needed surgery. it passed on it's own the next morning. The nurse in the ER told me that a lot of people think it's worse than the pain experienced during childbirth. Don't know if that's true but it would not surprise me."
