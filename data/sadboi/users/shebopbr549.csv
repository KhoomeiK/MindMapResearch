Thetruthishere,fr4tpc6,t1_fr4s9av,1589896673.0,"A frequency of wave lengths aka vibration isn't really meaningless. Its supersting theory and it came from einstein's theory of relativity and the double slit experiment. Theoretical yes, but it's only meaningless to you because you dont know about it. There is a reason people have always said ""vibe high"". Idk why kids these days say it tho.. but they're onto something & they prob dont even know it."

BlackOutBoyz,fr25uhw,t1_fr253t7,1589831665.0,Yeah heroin sucks. Not a fan of straight up morphine either. Dilaudid was a fav as well as Fent. I never smoked heroin although some people did. I'm really curious about straight up opium. Fresh from they plant. Not altered
southernfood,fr1utom,t1_fr0nkvf,1589826325.0,I will post some recipes soon!
southernfood,fr1gjxk,t1_fr0svbg,1589819345.0,Yes jiffy is amazing alone but my fam has always added a bit of sugar. â™¡ I loveee cornbread. And it's pretty easy to make buttermilk biscuits too! Bread is just great period lol.
BlackOutBoyz,fr1g30y,t1_fr0zsja,1589819112.0," morphine,dones, oxy, codine are derived from the poppy plant. The chemical makeup is altered to make all the other meds. There's acetaminophen in dones lol so for u to describe it like that is a bit inaccurate. I'm a recovering addict. I still take my script of dones when I need to but I dont do heroin anymore. Heroin is really strong but its cut with all kinds of nasty stuff, so I would imagine the high from opium wouldnt be quite as strong but def cleaner and more pure/natural."

TrueOffMyChest,fqriw52,t1_fqr932z,1589585255.0,I support your ideas because I wish I was like you. I wish i didnt take things so extremely personally and play them over and over in my head trying to figure out where i went wrong. My mom is a narcissist so it's always been tons of situations like this. There is always more than 1 way/angle to work or handle a situation. You're not wrong. And that doesnt mean she was right. It just means we are all different and that's ok.
Cutters,fqnhnui,t3_gjki36,1589495024.0,"Use antibiotics. Keep it clean and heavily moisturized when it begins to close up so you wont have horrible scars. Keep it covered. Dont let anyone see it. You will regret it. People will judge you. And the regret and shame will make you feel worse. I'm a cutter too and I just want you to know its not safe to show anyone. The arms are so tempting. I understand. Be strong and use thought stoppers. When you start considering a session, just redirect your mind. It's a healthy coping mechanism. Please try. If not for your health, do it to avoid the BS from other people when they notice it. I'm sorry if I sound rude. I'm just trying to be direct so I am not misunderstood. Take care. It's an addiction just like anything else"
SuicideWatch,fqnghb3,t1_fqng7wz,1589494420.0,Thank you for the validation (and the spiritual hug). It goes so much further than you would imagine. I urge you to remember your dream. Dont let it go. â™¡â™¡ thx for responding
SuicideWatch,fqng1rl,t3_gjjzw4,1589494204.0,"I understand and relate to you. I envy those resilient people who fall down, get back up and try again. Every time I fall or face humiliation or shame or guilt, I feel ready. I've woken up to new days and given it my all and I still feel pathetic.. even my family thinks I'm worthless. I reached out to my mom (not about depression but about something to do with parenting) and she told me to stop whining. So the isolation continues and worsens. I still have dreams though.. do you have any dreams left? Because if you do. There is hope for you, dear."

SuicideWatch,fpj6lbg,t3_gdmart,1588658104.0,"I can relate. Alot. I manipulate the docs so I wont be diagnosed bipolar or something worse cuz I'm paranoid. I have no fear of death. The only fear I have is hurting the people closest to me. They dont deserve the kind of pain that could induce. I've lost a loved 1 to suicide. A year ago in March. And it ripped my heart out.. we talked about doing it so many times. And now he is gone and I'm still here, 1 year later. I'm torn on suicide. There were 6 suicides in the bible. It doesnt really say it's wrong. I'm sorry you're hurting like this. Think long and hard before you make any permanent decisions. Sometimes the feelings are temporary. Happiness is supposedly fleeting anyways. Hang in there, if not for yourself, for the ones that love u â™¡"
