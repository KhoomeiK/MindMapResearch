I was suspicious that she was cheating on me. Should’ve trusted my gut from the start. I knew she was “close” with this other guy named Erik. I know they hooked up multiple times while i was in a relationship with her. I looked at her phone one time and he was talking shit about me, saying she was hot and could do better. Well I up learning that she was also cheating on me with my “best” friend. She ended up being a psychopath/sociopath (actually). I Moved out and blocked both of them. This was a pretty traumatizing experience, and now I’m scared to ever try in a relationship again."

Now I’m trying to contact any friends she had and figure out exactly what she was up to. I know she cheated a few times, I just need some clarification because it was with her ex, and very possible my best friend/roommate. Now ex best-friend, and I’m absolutely devastated. He also stole $500 from me. Seriously don’t understand what I did to deserve any of this and it’s such a terrible feeling. I have no trust left in anyone. I feel as if my life was turned upside down. I’ve been trying to plot a revenge, but idk if that’s going to work. All I can do is flex and make some more money I suppose."
