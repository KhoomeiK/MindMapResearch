actuallesbians,fp2uyab,t1_fp2tkkp,1588268316.0,"I understand how the stigma around it could cause an issue that I don't understand the full intensity of, but on the flip side two points:

1. Being overweight/obese actually has negative externalities, so although I don't think there should be societal abuse of overweight people and I am in that category too - I think that being a female with a penis should be better accepted than obesity.

2. A lot of women have trauma related to different things. For some of us it is a part of a body. So I don't think its fair to lump it in with people being shallow on looks. I personally tried to like dick to the point where it eventually started to make me vomit or cry and panic. Guess what I'm not doing it again.

So if you don't see it as lying, why omit my real reason for not wanting to carry on?

I spent a lot of time having sex with dick and will genuinely never ever touch it again as long as I live.

I see it as 2 different things"
actuallesbians,fp2nffj,t1_fp2glo7,1588264735.0,"Because I think honesty is important, I'm not sure how I would go about this.

Does it depend whether someone likes their parts and intends on keeping them no? Like yes I wouldn't want to make someone feel unwanted for something they can't control, but if it is a part of them they like and intend on keeping, I don't see why they would be offended by the honesty that its just not something I'm into? 

I might not compare it to calling someone ugly (because ugly is bad and nobody is calling dick bad), but more like comparing it to having really big boobs. If you are turned off by jumbo boobs it might be rude to tell someone you dont like them, but this might genuinely be the case. 

Basically sorry for rambling but do you see a better way than outright lying to someone? Because to me that makes it seem like a bigger deal than it is."

You are totally right that you should be able to go do things without her. Especially work things in my opinion. You only really invite a S/O if other people are from what I understand some work get togethers are just work people. So she should understand that. 

At the same time, think about if you can compromise maybe on your willingness to meet her where she's at on the social activity scale. I am an introvert but more moderate, and I would be really bummed if my partner never wanted to join me on my quest to enjoy life. I get that it can be your personality but I suggest thinking about how you can fulfill her end a little more, while still explaining that you get your energy from being alone and being in larger groups is very draining to you. But you do care about her and you are gonna do your best to put yourself out there more.
