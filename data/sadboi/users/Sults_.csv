lonely,fowm1as,t1_fovpgna,1588122440.0,"I agree that being confident can be better than being attractive, but 99% of the time its not the case. If someone isn't confident or is really shy, them being attractive means they will still be approached or people will try to talk to them, if they are confident(which they are more likely to be than ugly people) they have more a chance than others. Maybe it can work out for unattractive people, but in almost all cases looks beat personality."

depression,flymkgo,t1_flyjqpr,1585604969.0,"It isn't me trying to find happiness in someone else and more of just not wanting to be alone, how can I be happy if I'm alone, maybe some people can but I just can't. In nearly 20 years no one has chosen me, no one has loved me, not once. I don't feel subpar, I am subpar I can think of many things that make me subpar, I've given myself the benefit of the doubt and I know what I am, there is really nothing special about me. I'm not attractive, physically and as a person. 

Genuine question what will a change in my mindset do, even if I thought it will all be alright and in the end, someone will love me and that I am good, will that automatically make me good, will that make someone love me because I don't think it will. I can't lie to myself that easily. I have tried and failed, Im still failing. All I do is disappoint myself.

I understand you are trying to help and I've come off a rude or cold, but I really appreciate it, Im glad there are people like you out there and thank you for trying to help someone its very kind of you."

I shouldn't have to live in fantasy worlds in my head to be happy, I shouldn't be content with scenarios in my head and I should go out and do the things I want to in real life rather than just imagine they are true(although this isn't the case for some bizarre MDD).

It can be nice at the time, it can ease loneliness and boredom, but I think its kind of like an addiction.
