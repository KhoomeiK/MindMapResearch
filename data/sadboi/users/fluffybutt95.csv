depression,fej2r0i,t1_fej0tz3,1579154726.0,"Well, I have been on pills for one year. I started feeling better so I stopped using. I scored 27 on a 30 point depression test before pills. Seeking professional help isn't a bad idea, however I delat with it on my own. I think the first step is being honest with yourself and figuring out what is the main source of your depression. Is it existential crisis or body image related or any other reason and only than you can start figuring out your way out of it. It's the rotten and disfigured logic that's killing you. Therapists often tell you to change the way you are thinking and I can confirm that that works. You might think that what you feel is true or genuine but it's not. You have to doubt your depression and whatever it creates. After a decade you might want to seek professional help."

depression,f23qu7w,t1_f23jclg,1569935132.0,"True. That's why I dont have instagram acc anymore. It was a trigger for me as well as twitter. Users share only nice things about their life and their profiles look gorgeous and successful and it makes you feel like shit. They suffer too but they just don't show it. I read a book: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life  and honestly it's good. It strikes you exactly where it hurts. Please check it out, I promise you, you won't regret reading it. I think you can find the book for ""free"" online somewhere ;) Just hold on and don't give up"
depression,f23hylg,t3_dbkjo9,1569925756.0,"I agree but....mandatory insurance or basic insurance should cover some antidepressants which should help you feel better and help you make better decisions. That is, maybe find a better job, be a bit more optimistic and realize that there is no person in this world that doesn't suffer.

I work for 10 hrs a day so I have something to distract me but sometimes the work it self is the cause of low mood. So,  I don't get many naps...only when I'm home, when I dont work for a week. It's not a coping mechanism and naps are healthy as long as they are shorter than 90 minutes. I got used to it, although I never sleep more than 7 hrs, even on the weekends. My body just works that way."
