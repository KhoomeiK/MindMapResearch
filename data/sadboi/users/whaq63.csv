movies,f9yr9yr,t3_e78qsh,1575732766.0,"Yep, that's right. No doubt about it. Alien (1979) is excellent. Aliens (1986) is very good. And Alien3 (1992) assembly cut is very good too in my opinion.

I recommend these three movies. To anyone who dislike or hate Alien3 (1992), I suggest you give it another try and watch assembly cut of Alien3. It is not perfect but still very good in my opinion."

fnv,f7u5j4p,t1_f7u3i3y,1574011084.0,"I thought it was your first play through of this DLC. I played Dead Money only one time and saved Christine and God/Dog but killed Dead Domino. I killed Elijah and only took one gold bar as a souvenir from Sierra Madre vault. I let go of all the other gold bars.

I also like Old World Blues and Lonesome Road. I once started Honest Hearts but did not find the tribal conflict and story interesting. So I stopped playing it after some quests."
fnv,f7u159m,t3_dxokh1,1574009594.0,"Ah Dead Money. Great DLC. Everything about this DLC seems perfect to me. Gameplay can be frustrating but it was a minor inconvenience for me for an otherwise solid DLC.

I don't take screenshot before leaving DLCs. I just keep a save file.

How was your experience in this DLC? Did you like it?"
technology,f7sgv58,t3_dxko9m,1573994651.0,Hooray to Firefox for fighting for the privacy and rights of internet users.
fnv,f7rct8c,t3_dxg71g,1573979003.0,"DLCs are very good and I highly recommend them. FNV has the best DLCs. Some people say that DLCs are better than the main story of base game. Dead Money has the best story in FNV and some good weapons and best light armor. Old World Blues has very some good perks and fun weapons. Lonesome Road has the best medium armor and some good weapons. I suggest you buy the Ultimate Edition if its possible for you. And just enjoy the experience. I hope you have fun.

What SPECIAL and skills you want to use for your character? Do you have any specific build in mind?"
fnv,f6i3zhd,t3_drb3p6,1572871546.0,"Dead money is also my favorite DLC. Everything about it is just great: story, characters, atmosphere/environment, soundtrack, new weapons (Police pistol is my favorite one handed gun and Holorifle which is just overpowered is my favorite energy weapon) and new armor sets (Sierra Madre Armor reinforced is the best light armor in FNV). The message (let go) is also great and gives the story depth.

Plus the Sierra Madre chips which you get every three days after completing the DLC just makes weapons maintenance easy. Because you can get weapon repair kits from Sierra Madre vending machine in the Abandoned Brotherhood of Steel Bunker.

Also you can use Abandoned Brotherhood of Steel Bunker as your home. It has a lot of containers and you can store your things in them categorically."
