AMA,f9thzf7,t3_e6takk,1575625275.0,I asked my therapist if only for this month we have 2 visits instead of 4 and they said either I find a way to make the payments for the 4 or I should see another therapist. We’re roughly 3 months in. Thoughts? I explained that the holidays were a strain and I really couldn’t come up with the money but they insist I’m too fragile to not go every week .. so just stop seeking help altogether? Feeling upset.

adderall,eqq7cji,t3_bb3646,1560214010.0,i am the same way; eventually dehydration and weight gain will take they're toll. You'll start to stink of alcohol when you sweat and when you talk. Your tolerance will go up and you'll tip'. always happens to me. anyone else here have advice?
