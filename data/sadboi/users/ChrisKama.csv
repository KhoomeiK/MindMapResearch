I've tried to go to my family and friends and no... they couldn't get me out of the depression hole, only professional help got me out of it. Therapy doesn't help if you don't go with a psychiatrist who gives you antidepressants. 

Let me ask you (and let's take your friend out of this), what do you want in your life? and what do you think you need to improve it?"

SuicideWatch,f8nv8u0,t3_e16xsl,1574653835.0," Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help. A couple of key points to keep in mind:

&#x200B;

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.** Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!""). Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

Indeed, it's in the stickied post from the moderator in this subforum but some dickheads don't bother on reading it. About not caring about a random person, you're wrong there. I did some charity work and I'm still here despite I'm not suicidal now (professional help got me through, it was a long and tough journey though) because I want to help other people who is depressed and suicidal... why? because I've been there and I believe we deserve better, we deserve to have someone who cares and actually listen to us"

Pay an escort (not the hookers from the streets but one from an internet site, someone who is around 24-30 years old), why? You'll acquire intimacy experience, how to treat a girl in there and you can talk to her (escorts are hired for one hour unlike hookers who you just bang and they leave) so you can also learn what to talk about with a girl (that's why it's better if you pay for someone around your age).
Next you'll have to go to a psychiatrist so he can give you medication to treat anxiety (yes, it can be treated with excellent results). 
Last but not least, you should start dating girls you're not really into (not girls who disgust you, but girls that when you see them make you think ""well she is not THAT bad"" and this is where you'll learn the most, how to make a better connection with a woman for example
