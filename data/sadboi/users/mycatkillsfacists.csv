However I have heard of no advantages to using it for any other sport. When I was taking Science of Human Nutrition in college it was carbs carbs carbs. This many before an event this many after. Doing this will store carbs in the skeletal muscle, doing that will store it in the liver.

I don't work in sports, I'm a diet tech in a hospital but low carb isn't even a recognized diet in healthcare. We're still studying it, it's a pseudo science at this point and there are valid concerns about what ketoacidosis will do to your kidneys in the long run.

1. If I feel like I'm outside my body I do a grounding exercise.
-take a deep breath through the nose and out of the mouth 
-say the names (out loud or in your head) of 5 things you can see
-another breath
-4 things you can feel (clothes, feet on the ground, etc)
-breath
-3 things you can hear
-breath
-2 things you can smell (I try to have some hand lotion on are a hot drink. Or maybe smell the shampoo in my hair)
-breath
-1 thing you can taste (I try to have a drink handy or a piece of candy)
Repeat as needed

Anxiety,eubzr6r,t3_cfr3hq,1563661148.0,"I felt a lot of the same things when I was your age. If I was in public and I heard someone laughing I'd assume they were laughing at me. I didn't say anything about it. It wasn't that bad after all

Being from a catholic family we didn't talk about feelings that much. As a result I buried my emotions for years. When I was 19 I found myself pacing back in for in my apartment at 6 am (I hadn't slept all night) I was crying and hyperventilating. I walked to a friend's apartment  and he said I probably had anxiety and panic attacks like him. The next day I called university mental health services, they got me on prozac, they got me into therapy. 

After a few months the drugs started to take the edge off of stressful situations. I was still stressed but not paralyzed or crying. My therapist helped me create a network of friends and family I could talk to when things got bad. However I did lose years of my life being paralyzed with fear because I was telling myself ""it's not that bad I can handle it""

I wish I could have been brave as you when I was your age and thinking about getting help. It would have saved me a lot of hardship. And things might not go for you like they did me, you might not even need medication, just to get it all out there and talk to a neutral party.

If you're considering getting help for your problems I'd suggest talk to an adult you trust about your feelings. Or maybe get in touch with a school counselor. Or even at your next regular doctors appointment mention what's going on to them and they may refer you to someone.

This all might just be normal for your age but really a professional should decide that. You'd get a check up for your body now get one for your brain"

It probably varies depending on how much excercise you are doing, if you get sick or injured, your age etc. Also we typically don't want to see it get that far so we'll nip it in the bud. Deficiencies can seriously mess you up. Lack of vit  A can cause night blindness, lack of b 12 anemia, if you're low in folate and get pregnant the child is at increased risk for spina bifida, and so on.

So typically we just go with the standard advice of balance diet, lots of fruit, veg, whole grains, and lean protein. Interesting question though."
