homeland,foplnnq,t1_fopjiso,1587964831.0,This is why the finale  should've been longer (2+ hours) so those plot holes could've been covered. I loved the finale but I still think the story could've benefited from an extra hour.
homeland,foplcz4,t1_fopizrv,1587964597.0,I'd def watch it.

homeland,fnxaq7q,t3_g4g0d5,1587334846.0,"I would've love to see some sort of conclusion on this current episode, whereas the finale is the weeks after and focused on Carrie's life beyond the CIA. Maybe I'm just used to GoT where most of the action and main storylines conclude on the penultimate episode. The actual finales are more subdued. 

I also feel like the episode will be rushed. Unless the episode starts with Saul and Carrie confronting each other with the circumstances, I don't see how all of this can be done in  an hour."

homeland,fnuwcwn,t3_fugeph,1587272867.0,"Easily one of the best episodes to date. The breakdown into Saul's ties to Russia was brilliant, especially his way of communicating to his asset. I could watch a entire season of young Saul. 

As far as Carrie goes, if she decides to kill Saul that would be the most ridiculous ending to a phenomenal series. Carrie is too fuckng smart for that and I will not accept it."

However, it's still a tax break to the wealthy. Hidden in a bill that was created under the guise that the government would help the most vulnerable Americans who are forced to stay home without regular pay. This is just ****another**** instance of the government prioritizing the rich. Most Americans would be livid if the details were at the forefront instead of purposely hidden."

I believe that he wants Carrie out of his way for his own personal reasons. Something isn't right."

homeland,fluzi0y,t1_fluvktq,1585513256.0,I think the writers have done that strategically to make us think that Carrie has a soft spot for him but the Carrie we have known for 8 seasons doesn't rest until she gets justice/revenge.
