DecidingToBeBetter,fph3oi6,t3_gd54r2,1588614405.0,"Congrats! Good on you for doing that!

Since the beginning of the year I actually tried taking a break from some of my social media and I agree I felt a lot more free. The only problem is that I still use social media every now and then mostly because of the whole Corona virus situation :("
SonicTheHedgehog,foveor8,t3_g9pt4o,1588100057.0,This is actually really good ngl
stevenuniverse,fmfn64z,t3_fuwlq5,1586030771.0,You did a very great job! It looks really close to the actual show especially the background :)
stevenuniverse,flobuw2,t3_fpokrr,1585335319.0,I really love this. The best part is that I can actually hear her voice in this xD
SonicTheHedgehog,fj2ib06,t3_fb4g62,1582944391.0,Bruh...nice job though
SonicTheHedgehog,fiqgy98,t1_fiph94v,1582644083.0,"Yeah, I'm catching up with Boom right now and I'm really liking it so far!"
SonicTheHedgehog,fio6g1k,t1_finyuwh,1582577214.0,I've only seen a few episodes but I like it so far!
SonicTheHedgehog,fio6cee,t1_finkc0z,1582577158.0,Those are my faves as well :)
SonicTheHedgehog,fio69ff,t1_finl71n,1582577113.0,I think it can count too. I liked that miniseries as well :)
DecidingToBeBetter,filkshy,t3_f8htwn,1582503911.0,I was going through this exact same problem as you. I get tired of seeing social media and see everyone having a better time than me. I just recently deactivated my Instagram account and I'm hoping that it will help me feel less stressed. Hope this continues to work out for you!
DecidingToBeBetter,fiii3tu,t3_f7cztp,1582421898.0,"I honestly can't thank you enough for making this post and encouraging all of us with your inspirational words!

I've been trying my best to improve myself but it gets really hard sometimes when life just hits me with bad luck :( I barely have any friends and I keep trying my best to try different things but most of the time it just ends up with me flopping. I often feel like I'm just a cursed or broken person :(

I'm sorry to hear your parents are like that. I could never imagine how it must be like for those people who grow up in abusive families. I'm honestly very thankful that I have a family that loves me and if it wasn't for them encouraging me every day, I don't know where I would be today. I would have probably offed myself a long time ago.

Despite the fact that I have a loving family, all I ask for is to meet REAL friends in my life and not people who constantly use me..."

amphibia,fhcme9t,t3_f26q74,1581465994.0,I'm pretty sure Radrappy is the name of the creator's Twitter. That means that the creator commented on your post! You must be lucky!

DecidingToBeBetter,fg4y4ga,t1_fg3y1qs,1580513721.0,Thanks for your advice. I'll think about it.
DecidingToBeBetter,fg4xqmm,t3_ewwqs9,1580513465.0,"I wish you luck on that :)

I've been trying to follow this mentality myself as well. Just try to stay positive and don't let others put you down!"

I wish I could try this #Toonme meme that's going around but I feel like my art isn't that skilled to do something like that yet ;\^;"
cartoons,feo5sp9,t3_eq5ajj,1579295450.0,Pretty cute! :)

Blue's Clues and You is another good one too."
cartoons,faim9p5,t3_e8irgt,1576111286.0,"No I kind of agree with you. I actually quite liked the show back when it was airing because it had its moments where it could actually be funny. I feel like most of the haters didn't give it a proper chance. I understand that the show isn't for everyone but for a show that was built on being wacky and absurd, it wasn't half bad."
SuicideWatch,f4jmb55,t3_dkfkaq,1571622142.0,"I've always felt like this is supposed to be my way to go. Even though things have started to get a lot more brighter for me, I still have this bad feeling that the option of suicide will come back to get me if I ever get severely depressed again..."

SuicideWatch,etqfyde,t3_ccydq4,1563083420.0,It's literally the same for me. My family is the only reason why I'm still here. If it wasn't for them I would have offed myself years ago :(
SuicideWatch,etqfrn3,t3_ccxhtn,1563083203.0,This is literally my life right now..I hope God finds a way to help all of us :(
SuicideWatch,etqfnc8,t3_ccy7qn,1563083062.0,"Well, on a positive note, at least you have people wishing you ""happy birthday"". That's a sign that there are people out there who do care.
But I'm sorry to hear you're going through all these emotions :("
SuicideWatch,et8it6d,t3_cacqmf,1562557750.0,"I'm going through this exact same problem as you :(
I really want to try to be more positive but there's always something that's trying to bring me down.
But I guess the best advice I can give, is to try and look and focus on any positives in your life, even if its just one thing. It can be any family member or any personal material that you have.
Maybe try spending time on your favorite hobbies as well :)"
SuicideWatch,et8hnoz,t3_ca9lof,1562556754.0,The first time I ever had thoughts of suicide on myself was when I was about 13 just finishing from elementary school. But the first time I was almost serious of doing it was when I was about 15 in high school.
SuicideWatch,et8gu8b,t3_cad09o,1562556079.0,Same here..
CartoonNetwork,et3z099,t3_c7aimk,1562441486.0,You actually did a pretty good job there :)
