Servicedogfakers,fq6aijt,t1_fq6ag8k,1589127773.0,Yep Was getting ready to do it but wanted to make sure you saw the post edit- comment not post
Servicedogfakers,fq6a99n,t1_fq69upa,1589127629.0,Yeah I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. I don‚Äôt want her getting harassed in the internet while being so young. I‚Äôm afraid it would stick with her forever ü•¥
Servicedogfakers,fq69kgz,t1_fpw0cu4,1589127238.0,I had proof that the dog wasn‚Äôt task trained and the handler admitted she had munchism but I think she deleted her account üòÖ I‚Äôm going to have to remove this one though because I didn‚Äôt realize how young that kid really was
Servicedogfakers,fphf5vc,t1_fpheupa,1588620194.0,Yep. That would be a good idea. I‚Äôm making a draft for rules right now. I made two new flares for ones you see ‚Äúout in the wild‚Äù

illnessfakersgonewild,fph3kvf,t3_gdg6nt,1588614354.0,Okay so I‚Äôve got someone trying to help me find one but neither of us can find anything so I made one
AskReddit,fogjjzf,t1_fogj46k,1587753384.0,It was great till everyone got fired or quit. I was the only one to stay but decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I ended up finding a place just down the road. What I made at the old place in two weeks and make out the new place in one week and have less hours which is great for a person still trying to survive high school
AskReddit,foghol2,t1_fogh94x,1587752712.0,Lol true. Mine pays over minimum wage but the place I came from was awful and wouldn‚Äôt wash the chicken pans. I was there 35+ hours a week at 16.  I ended up training my managers and decided I wasn‚Äôt paid enough for that lol. The new gm begged me to stay after he took all my days and put me on for one day a week
AskReddit,fogh1b7,t1_foggwlv,1587752477.0,Oh yuck. We kinda just spray stuff off with water and dip it in sanitation water
AskReddit,fofxrse,t1_fofq560,1587744672.0,Happend at a truck stop I worked at. They tried to get it fixed immediately but it was still pretty awful. We was only allowed to drain the sink one time.
memes,fkfuu2s,t3_fi06en,1584143065.0,We bump elbows at work instead of high-fives but we have done that for over a year
StopSelfHarm,f988qcv,t3_e41yfj,1575175285.0,What app is that? Also congratulations!!
StopSelfHarm,f8vu5i4,t1_f8ujg58,1574877324.0,Oh my gosh I never even thought of that she might have been through some bad stuff that makes her know what it‚Äôs like. I want to be the person she is for me for someone else someday.
StopSelfHarm,f8s9roi,t3_e1vnm1,1574774540.0,I could help if you would like !
AskDocs,f8fw2yt,t1_f8fuywp,1574550204.0,"If I don‚Äôt have a way for it to get looked at tonight, would tomorrow be too late?"
AskDocs,f8fsxt5,t1_f8fsto7,1574548958.0,It was a hot glue gun. I waited to take off the glue till it dried so it didn‚Äôt burn my fingers too
AskDocs,f8fr2kp,t1_f8fqxcd,1574548269.0,Is it normal to not be able to feel the large white spot? It doesn‚Äôt even hurt but the blisters around it do
Wicca,f81yhzx,t1_f81jf15,1574180136.0,It‚Äôs so fluffy üòÇ it‚Äôs literally my favorite blanket I own
Wicca,f80q7za,t1_f80q53k,1574135337.0,Oh okay thank you!
Wicca,f80mwc1,t1_f80med2,1574132901.0,On the other side there is a small film of like rainbow on a broken off peice
Wicca,f80ktff,t3_dy6lp2,1574131439.0,I have a blanket identical to that background
Wicca,f7ug4sz,t1_f7n6rhu,1574014483.0,I do live in the Bible Belt. The place I work is full of people of minority religions. The manager is basically like my mother and had saved my life once. I trust this lady more than my own mother because is is basically my mother. Though I never though if some of the stuff you had brought up. I will definitely be careful about who I talk to about it.
Wicca,f7mx7c4,t1_f7mwjob,1573876533.0,It did. I want to explain how everyone is different. :)
Wicca,f7mw9op,t1_f7mw3yc,1573875692.0,I definitely want to explain it. We have known each other for a while. She just is very curious. I want to explain to her in every way I can if that makes sense. I want to explain it from different ways of people thinking
TrueChronicIllness,f7cid6b,t1_f7ch5lp,1573592904.0,Yeah. To make it worse I started having seizures at work last night and finally one of the people I work with was like wow there is actually something wrong
Fibromyalgia,f78xtz5,t3_dup41a,1573499862.0,I was in a dark bad place. I tried to kill myself more than once. My manager stepped in and saved my life (she also has fibromyalgia). What I‚Äôm trying to say is maybe find someone in your situation and talk to them or someone who used to be in your situation.
Fibromyalgia,f78l8st,t3_duuyms,1573494840.0,My eye has twitched ever since I was a small kid.
Fibromyalgia,f6r93q2,t3_dsp17e,1573096890.0,"To be honest, I‚Äôm completely opposite. I can‚Äôt seem to gain any weight due to getting nauseous from pain and and migraines"
Fibromyalgia,f6r8lg5,t3_dsofxb,1573096498.0,"Good job. My first time working an 8 1/2 hour shift, I went home and didn‚Äôt get out of bed for a few days üòÇ"
Fibromyalgia,f6darlw,t3_dqy5sw,1572792768.0,I didn‚Äôt know they was caused by fibromyalgia. We used to think mine was seizures but the neurologist said it was all in my head
Fibromyalgia,f5yb1j0,t3_dp8d1r,1572553472.0,Oh thank you for this
illnessfakers,f5y1io1,t1_f5y01c1,1572549438.0,Oh what show??
TrueChronicIllness,f5t7wpw,t1_f5ssyig,1572452411.0,This is exactly how I feel.
TrueChronicIllness,f5sj08h,t1_f5sdb16,1572432750.0,Wow.  I guess I‚Äôve always struggled with it until I met one special person. She was my manager who had issues too. It started to feel like things was actually better then I basically hit a brick wall.  I guess why I paid attention to the other place is so I didn‚Äôt end up on there
TrueChronicIllness,f5rx4ux,t3_d3iu20,1572405141.0,I felt the same for the longest time until I found out my manager had the same problems I do while she was a teen and also has some of the same diagnosis as me. She is the only person that I felt truly listened. I would try to find a group therapy sort of thing with people of the same problems as you
illnessfakers,f5ru4rf,t3_doxhva,1572403082.0,Yes ugh. She is now my ex best friend. (We are no longer friends due to some bad decisions on her part)
illnessfakers,f5mks67,t3_dodsxa,1572290983.0,Oof busted
