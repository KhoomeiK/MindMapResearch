We had lived together for a year, and so he moved out once we broke up, and now I live alone. It was fine at first cause I was going to class everyday and seeing friends and working, essentially just distracting myself. But now I can’t do any of that and I’m just left to face my feelings. It feels harder than ever. I talk to my counsellor every week and that helps, but oh my gosh I feel so alone and I can’t stop regretting breaking up with my ex, I just want things to go back to the way they were."
