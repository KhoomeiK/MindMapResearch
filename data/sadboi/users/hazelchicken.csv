Because he was kind and liked helping people become better.

Dio was a child. Literally just a little kid. From Georges point of view:
Dio was prickly and cold to Johnathan. Understandable, his parents just died and he has come from a life where he can trust NOBODY.
George wants to HELP. he wants to show kindness to Dio to help him become a better man - like he tried to help his father.
He wanted him to feel SAFE in his new home so he didn't need to be so defensive and violent.

He didn't ""Abandon"" Jojo - he like sent him to his room once or twice. 
He grounded him for fighting his new brother (as a gentleman he should know better) and told him off for eating sloppily (as a gentleman he should know better).
He treated him SLIGHTLY unfairly - but he didn't see Dio do all the things WE saw him do. He just saw regular childish antics, teasing his sibling and being a bit mean.

Very soon - as in within weeks or even a month or so - Dio STOPPED being troublesome and he and Jojo made amends and became friends.

Is George foolish to spend a month being gentle with a feral street-kid to adjust him into his new life? Why the hell would he look at a 10 yr old kid and say ""you are an evil demon spawn and totally not just a product of where you were raised""?"
unpopularopinion,fqwkife,t1_fqweqg9,1589707791.0,"""But veganism is definitely more ethical than eating meat.""
I think that's debatable.

I don't think death is a bad thing, especially death to feed another creature. I think suffering in death or suffering in life before death is grotesque and unnecessary - but dying is a wonderful thing that directly allows more life to exist.
Veganism is not death-free nor suffering-free, its just easier on certain, select organisms in certain climates.

Australia is a very dry country. We have alot of open land with incredibly unique and endangered organisms on it - but not alot of water. That's generally ok, our delicate environment is built to survive in a dry environment in dry soil.

Crops destroy that.

You take a plot of land and destroy the native soil by trying to make it specialized for one non-native plant. Billions of plants and insects are killed. Thousands of reptiles, mammals and birds who relied on those insects are left without homes and without food - along with the predators who ate them.

You grow a single non-native crop that MAINLY non-native bugs and animals eat, who then move in and further push out weak native creatures who have a severe lack of food.
Non-native mammals like mice spread disease around the native small marsupials, especially when they plague and die.

Worst of all - the WATER required to keep crops healthy is ridiculous! We drain rivers just to feed thirsty plants on land not built to retain it!
To water an entire crop - one that burns easially in our fiery country - is just horrendous. Fires are necessary, Many of our native plants cannot BREED without being scorched - but as they are a risk to our crops and rural houses we stop them from happening.

Some Aborigional nations would set fire to their homes before moving on to the next place on purpose. When they returned it would be full of life and food. 
Stopping them from doing this tradition which has continued for 50,000+ years has destroyed ecosystems - and no doubt made animals go extinct - just so we can save crops.

This happens without veganism of course, we still need our veggies, but to increase crop types and yields is NOT a cruelty-free, environmentally friendly option for dry countries in particular. It would cause far more damage to incredibly delicate lives.

You can keep a SHITTONE of cattle with far less water wastage and soil destruction. The ecosystem survives much easier around them. I don't think cattle raised with space and freedom being killed for food is unethical.
(Of course, the most environmentally friendly meat is Kangaroo rather than cattle. We should be eating that more.)

Even in European countries which are far more capable of safely supporting the vegan lifestyle (less land and more water is perfect for plants) there are still ethical issues with veganism.

Most crops of food people rely on requite the use of bees for pollination. Not gentle ""let the bees do their thing"" pollination - forced and unhealthy use of bees for only human gain.
You put beehives on the back of trucks and drive them around your crop all day. They ONLY FEED ON ONE TYPE OF POLLEN - Avocado or apple or almond or whatever - and grow weak from a lack of variety in food.
Then its cheaper to throw them away at the end of the season than to try and nurse them back to health. Bee's are not expensive.

It is destructive and cruel, far more then scraping some honey off the top of their store, and yet its rarely brought up.


If you deem death itself as a bad thing then yes, trying to minimize death is 'more ethical'... but veganism isn't quite about that. 
Its about choosing the cute animals we have bred ourselves over wild animals we don't have much connection too, just like some people unfairly choose puppies over pigs and hens.
Animals you can ignore, the crickets and the earwigs and the millipedes and the skinks - they die horribly. They are still poisoned and upturned and ground into bread, going into our mouths rather than the mouths of birds and quolls and numbats. 
And whoever dares to invade our crops (such as emu's running through and destroying them for fun) must be dealt with to save the harvest.

That's why our native cultures are largely meat-focused in the first place - our country wasn't made to support massive plant life."

I have seen very poor vegans though. Vegan products are not necessary for a healthy life, they are mainly there so you can continue having the same sort of cuisine you are used to.  
Simply by switching what sort of food you make and what sort of ingredients you use you can make incredibly cheap and nutritious foods. There are countries who have had vegetarian or vegan cuisine for ***hundreds of years*** without issue - which are far tastier than ""a schnitzel with some steamed beans, spinach and potato mash - *but the meat isn't real*"".

But its not about the child at all. It's about his Cerebral Palsy, making that the ***defining trait*** of himself, and making it an ""othering"", strange quality.  
But the only thing it does to ""other"" him from abled people is prevent him from producing certain things and from making certain achievements.  


Nobodys life should be valued based upon what you can achieve or produce.   
*((I'm pretty sure this idea is where the idea of a ""mid-life crisis"" comes from - peoples bodies becoming more disabled as they age and preventing them from doing things they placed all their self worth upon.))*

ptsd,fn1njdj,t3_fyphuu,1586565855.0,"There was an odd case of this*... sort of?...* in a game called Metal Gear Solid 2.  
Its a fantastic series, and that games story is ***phenomenal*** in particular, but it gives one character PTSD like its absolutely nothing.   
The weird thing is its not used for comedy and it doesn't seem malicious - its treated *seriously* and yet is completely inaccurate.  


A character, due to horrible events in her past, is said to suffer PTSD towards water and being submerged. She is forced into a situation where the main character needs to swim her out of a place before it becomes submerged/blows up, so he suggests she just ""Holds onto him, holds her breath and shuts her eyes really tight until they resurface"".  
And she says ""ok"" and just... does that? No problem?  


It was pretty insulting despite not being used for a laugh. I think they really were meaning to be sensitive about the topic and yet failed in an absolutely jaw dropping fashion.  
My PTSD doesn't come from abuse either and its not some plot point in my life I can ignore when push comes to shove. That's sort of the point of the whole thing, you can't just ""toughen up"" and ignore it.  
Its one of the first times I really felt slapped in the face. Not being abused I think alot of abuse-themed comedy goes over my head, unfortunately."

metalgearsolid,fm9njch,t1_fm736ay,1585872411.0,"> The final questions posed in 2, like “who are the patriots”, “was this all even real”, “even if it wasn’t real is it still a meaningful experience”, all of that was meant to be open, up to your own interpretation, but in 4 they tried to give actual, tangible explanations to questions that weren’t even meant to be answered, because they were philosophical questions, not questions about the game’s lore.


This is a really good take actually. 
4 really does answer alot of questions that probably shouldn't be answered. They don't need it and for many purposes are better off without it. Its probably its weakest point.

But I still liked that stuff.
It didn't only bring together things from MGS2 but also MGS3, MGS, MG and MG2. It felt like an ending. I don't know the last time I played or watched something that felt like it actually ended. Cathartic as fuck.

""I think many people just don’t see beyond the story and lore of a game, they just see the events that unfold as “well, that’s just the plot I guess”, but don’t actually understand that there are themes and questions being posed to the player.""

This is how I feel about MGS3 actually. MGS4 has a shittone of that stuff, but its a bit more interpersonal than MGS2.
Its a story about how the concept of death affects people. Imminent death, future death, past death and the act of dying and killing. Age, trauma, illness and regrets.
Its a bit heavy handed but there's alot there to sink your teeth into.

Snake finally felt like a full character rather than a linchpin for the story. That's not a BAD thing to be in a video game by any means, but I've always liked that boy, so it was a treat (even though they kept bullying him :( ).
I loved how they dragged him back into Shadow Moses and used it as an echo of himself, of his whole life - an important and robust part of military history rusted into a mere shell by those who created it until it inevitably falls into the sea, forgotten. Famous and yet completely alone, covered in snow. 
Suddenly the feats that were accomplished there seem so meaningless.
Wandering around it felt like wandering around Snakes own head.

I disagree with the fan-service thing. The entire existence of MGS4 was fan-service. Everyone who had ever known Snake coming back, his life is long-term flashing before his eyes before it all ends.

Otacon actually getting some for once.
Sunny's entire existence.
Raiden being even more of an unhinged edgy badass.
Snake enjoying listening to the embarrassing J-pop music that Otacon has no doubt introduced him to - which is adorable.
Thousands of little secrets everywhere - like the previous games.
You get to pilot REX. AND fight Ray.
Meryl gets to be a badass.
A long-form drugged up old-man punch up between 3 characters.
Snakes self-sacrificing tendency's, but taken up to 1000%.
Otacon isn't allowed to be happy with a lady.
A motorcycle chase with EVA.
All your favourites from the previous games are back - but in a way that isn't annoying. They're actually cool.
Snake has throat/lung cancer from all his cigarettes - and then he finally quits.

It repeats all the major notes of the previous games in both story and game-play - one final HURRAH before the curtains close, and its a damn LOUD one.

Even the ever-present sexy-fan service for both genders, especially the ""omg this is stupid"" kind. It even has Kojima's favourite ""mid-boob"" snuck in there, the cheeky devil.
Snake is by far the absolute hottest he has ever been. I would die for this sexy old man. I will beat up Naomi for being mean to him - how dare she cry when he takes his shirt off. What a bitch. I'll kill her.
Have you seen his ass? They didn't need to do that but they did. Thanks Kojima.

I don't think the bosses are nonsense either. Aside from the bird they were all pretty fun.
... which is way more than I can say for MGS3's bosses, most of which felt even shallower in concept along with being forgettable and frustrating."

That's tricky too lol. The problem with writing a 1st episode is that it needs to introduce characters, setting, story and themes all for the very first time. First episodes can feel a bit wonky or confusing because of that.

In general I'd suggest comedy anime. They can relax on all the other stuff to tell jokes and have fun instead. But I haven't seen to many of them myself haha

**- Kaiji**  
A man in serious money debt gets offered chances to gamble his life, health and limbs for the entertainment of the rich. It is INTENSE and also looks really funky.  


**- Mushishi**  
Very very chill and mysterious. A lone doctor wanders around between villagers, trying to cute illnesses caused by ""Mushi"" - bacteria/yokai type creatures that are poorly understood.  


**- Natsume's book of Friends**  
Boy can see Yokai. His grandmother could also see Yokai - and she went around taking all of their names and putting them into a book. Reading out a Yokai's name makes you their master. Many yokai want this book to themselves, and those with their names taken want to be free from worrying who they belong to.  
Natsume wants to give all the names back. Its a slow and disruptive process that often throws his school life into disarray - yokai are dangerous after all.  


**- Tatami Galaxy**  
A man entering college doesn't want to waste his precious years of youth doing uninteresting things, so he tries to pick the best club to join to make the most of his time - but everything goes wrong. Like a groundhog-day hell the year is reset and he picks another club hoping things go differently this time... but everything seems to follow the same beats no matter what external things he tries to change.

languagelearning,flfbubx,t1_flfa8mf,1585102683.0,"You don't need to learn all of them. At school they teach a bit over 2000 of them - those are the ones that appear in newspapers.

You don't need to rush into learning all 2000 'required' kanji straight away - but it can be a handy way to kill two birds with one stone, learning vocabulary and its kanji at the same time.

It sounds like alot, but if you do it like grade schoolers do you learn them in a very easy to swallow fashion."

That's a smaller age gap than me and my partner lol  
She quotes Disney movies? oh no, what a travesty - she likes *animated movies*. She quotes vines? *So does my dad.*  


**Here's a fucking tip:**  
***Relationships don't crumble and go to shit because ages are different.***  
They suffer because one or more people don't want to communicate openly and equally with each-other about how they feel.   
They put their own feelings about their partners.   
They try to change how their partner feels by force.   
They can't state what they want or need and yet expect their partner to magically know.   
They don't say whats bothering them and let it bottle up and explode later.   
They can't view their own behavior as anything but 'perfect and logical' and refuse to apologize for things they've done wrong.  
They are too scared to tackle issues because it makes them feel bad and would rather just pretend they don't exist until it becomes too large and complex to handle.  


None of this has anything to do with age.  
It all has to do with respecting yourself and your partners as adult human beings you love and care about."

But it can section them off into what they teach in Japanese school grades 
or into n5 - n1 levels (n5 has 80, n4 166, n3 370, n2 370 and n1 1240)

And you can then further split those into further groups of 10 or 20 or whatever you want. Bite sized chunks.

It also teaches all the radicals apparently if you want to study them specifically. I did not know that until now.

AND, if you have Anki on your phone, it can export words and phrases directly into Anki for you."
languagelearning,flf1sm0,t1_flf0jwf,1585096143.0,"I'd recommend if its getting really grating and making you hate every second of it then its not worth the effort. You shouldn't be hating your time learning a language, especially not for supplementary material.

I never got to the third level of it but I don't think its OVERLY formal, but it is more *polite* that it needs to be for common interactions.  
I think most methods of learning are going to have that problem though.

Its best as a supplementary material on the side of other things if you don't want its effects to be more like memorizing a phrase book."

What the fuck are you supposed to do? Call an ambulance all by yourself while having a heart attack?  
Oh no, I wouldn't dream of waking my partner up while I'm DYING, that would just be *mean.*

Fucking ridiculous. Someone who gives a shit about you wouldn't even be cross if you just woke them up because you had a nightmare. They sort of 'love you' or whatever.  


Maybe he was mean because he hadn't woken up. Apparently im a sassy bitch when half-asleep, though I don't remember it later.

But in the morning he was still being a twat. ""Why go to the doctor? its probably just heartburn""  
Heartburn suddenly in the middle of the night when it has never happened before is a concern. **You go to the doctor to learn about your body, even if its probably fine.** ***That's what they are there for.***"

My partner only did the first few lessons YEARS AGO for Japanese and all I need to do is say half of a sentence and he can recite the rest - AND a few responses - while knowing what they mean.

Its not perfect and its not a complete learning package, but it is a drill in that it burrows into your skull and *never fucking leaves*"
languagelearning,flexvr4,t3_fofnq5,1585093758.0,"Phone app ""Kanji Study"" on android. I think its on app store too.  
**Kana and base 80 kanji are free,** rest is paid - but its been fantastic for me memorizing kanji. Even though you draw them with your finger I can still write them by pen after learning them.  
It doesn't teach everything but its sleek (i recommend the night mode), portable and robust in what it does."

They're old enough to make their own decisions, good and bad, and carry that consequence. That is vital to growing up, both fucking up and learning your bodies limits."
