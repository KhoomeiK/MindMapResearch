* Model: Semi Dress

* Size: 9.5 

* Width: EEE

* Last: 38 Swing Last

* Upper: Natural Chromexcel

* Sole: Vibram 700 Half Sole

* Price: $200 shipping in the USA

* Country: United States of America

* Condition: Gently Used/Worn

* Images: https://imgur.com/a/nFTqwfl

* Notes: These are a custom pare of White’s Semi Dress boots in Natural Chromexcel leather. This leather is a patina monster. It starts off a shiny light brown that darkens to a golden brown. The boots are fully lined by cream colored glove leather. There is light creasing along the toe box and up the shaft of the boot. Nothing exaggerated or ugly though.

These boots come with a Vibram half sole. This half sole is grippy and sleek. The half sole is perfect because it leaves the leather heel stack uninterrupted. The heel is a woodsman heel. Its curve and height are meant to create a natural stride and gate. It also helps promote knee and lower back relief - leaving you with a boot you can wear all day with little to no fatigue. 

The boots come in their original box. Thank you!"
