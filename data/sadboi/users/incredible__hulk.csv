I've tried many things to change how I feel. From therapy 2 antidepressants, self-help books even alcohol and drugs. Some things were helpful, some things where harmful, And some had bad consequences. In the midst of all of this suicide has always seemed like a viable option. For me it's an easier choice, I'm divorced with no children and single. however my survival instincts fight me tooth and nail.

Yes, having some sort of fatal accident sounds like the ultimate relief. Somewhere inside I do still have  Hope. So I would be interested in hearing anything that has brought relief any good books? Any special certain kind of therapy or counseling? Any type of antidepressant? Anytingüòï

 I start seeing a new therapists tomorrow. Also I just started reading a book that has grabbed my attention a lot. I would recommend taking a peek, it really is something else. The name of the book is ""brain in balance"" this book is this thing that has brought me hope."

Strongman,f7n63dw,t1_f7mdhqr,1573885880.0,"You have to consider a guy who's four times World's Strongest Man is obviously competitive. Being the best is something that is extremely important to him. That is why he spends countless hours in the gym each week, eats 12500 calories each and every day even if he can't stand to eat anymore he does it anyway. He gets eight or nine hours of sleep every night, takes countless supplements, maybe gets chiropractic and massage work done, etc Etc.

What I chalk this up to is his competitive nature coming out because he's been challenged, and anybody as competitive as Brian Shaw will Act that way. I don't see why the big fuss. I didn't feel like He was acting mean or rude at all when you consider the competitive nature of these guys. I know it myself because I am competitive and after I won multiple times,  I gained some confidence, and when someone challenges me and especially my records my competitive nature bubbles up.  So I say give Brian a break he is just doing what he does best being competitive."
Strongman,f7n4nbp,t1_f7lwtq8,1573884121.0,"I don't think it's so much that he thinks he'll out squat him, instead it's probably that his Squat is his strongest lift. So if he's going to go on TV against Brian Shaw lifting heavy he's obviously going to want to pick his strongest lift. I bet people will be surprised at how much Patrick can actually squat. When I started training my squat more my yoke walk went up significantly. Patrick is extremely good at the yoke  4 his size, which means his squat is probably also extremely good for his size."

Like y'all stated I was also mature at a young age.  I had great manners, spoke well, and knew how to feel a room out so I knew how to act (in a way that would keep the peace).  I had the utmost respect for authority.  

Grew up in a SUPER STRICT household.  Mom and/or step-dad would blow up over all kinds of things.  You'd never know when it was coming.  And any time they blew up it was my fault.  Physical discipline, yelling, swearing was the norm.  If you said anything in defense you got a smack on the head or face and were told ""don't talk back!""  My parents were very controling.  What I did in life, how I acted, and even my feelings were controlled by them.  I was scared of my parents and literally had no identity.

I'm in my late 30's now.  It wasn't until I was 27 and cut off all contact that I could start growing into my own identity.  I was extremely passive.  I had no idea what my feelings were.  I had major anger issues.  Needless to say I had a lot of work to do.

In the beggining I started reading self-help books: ""Victory Over The Darkness,"" ""Bondage Breakers,"" Boundaries,"" and several others.  The books helped me tremendously.  I started learning who ""I"" was, how to process anger and the real feelings under the anger.  My major insecurity began to melt away.  I learned how to set healthy boundaries.  This process taught me how to really truly LOVE MYSELF.  After a year I started to let my family back in, slooooowly and with boundaries.

It's been a decade and I still struggle with things.  I have a hard time being assertive with aggressive people.  But all in all the journey I had to go through carved character into me that's unique to my experience, I'm better for it, and I'm capable of helping others struggling with what I did, and SO ARE Y'ALL üòäüòÅüòä"
