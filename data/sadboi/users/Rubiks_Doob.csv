There definitely need to be many more of these types of advertisements on Fox news! I think these kinds of ads need a bit more drama to get his supporters’ attention."
TheColdPodcast,fpakd4n,t3_frx3m2,1588449963.0,"I think part of it was also that Susan was given the blame for messing up the Powell family in that Steve was obsessing over her 24/7. In that way, she passively had power over Steve. It seems like just another reason for Josh to get rid of her... to “save” his dad. Alina didn’t seem too find if her either."
TheColdPodcast,fp99b7w,t1_fp78jfi,1588419193.0,I also think that at some point Michael must’ve had the passwords for the true crypt hard drives. Josh left him everything in his will.
TheColdPodcast,fp785j6,t1_fp77r9o,1588365790.0,"I’m just wondering if anything of the sort was found when Michael’s computers and personal items were seized.
I am totally convinced that Josh documented everything he planned and did on those true crypt hard drives. Anything else would have been completely out of character for him."
TheColdPodcast,fp77ffx,t3_g9q9j5,1588365421.0,"I’m still interested in the sociopathic tendency. It was mentioned in podcast that Josh killed gerbils, and had threatened to kill his mom with a knife. Killing animals, setting fires etc. are early signs of sociopathic behavior. I wonder the details of these episodes... did Josh accidentally kill the gerbils or did he do it for entertainment? I know in the heat of the moment there are probably lots of teenaged boys in a rage of anger  who are so frustrated that they threaten to kill their parents, so I am giving it the benefit of the doubt that this was a one time situation. But is there more to this story? 
From Steve’s journal entry just after Susan went missing, it was clear he felt Josh was capable of killing, and my feeling was that Josh was always a concern to his parents in this regard. Terrica also
alluded to it in her interview, Jennifer seemed unsurprised all along. Did Steve keep journals his entire life? I’d love to read some of his entries from the time when Josh was a kid."
TheColdPodcast,fp75m2z,t3_gajcqa,1588364479.0,"Interesting info about the keeping of journals. In addition to Steve and Susan as well as Josh scanning and recording his every thought, I wonder if Michael kept records as well?"

I wonder if there were ever any places that matched the description of having lots and lots of berries, like Charlie mentioned in his first interview?"
TheColdPodcast,fozu57e,t3_ec1b9z,1588196909.0,"My thoughts were that after a late night out and about, Charlie probably slept in the car and had blurry memories of what happened after the “camping” trip.

I wonder if he had ever been on a plane before then?"
TheColdPodcast,fozslr0,t1_fec4l4o,1588196139.0,I was thinking the same... like maybe his password was something like greenbrownbluechameleon or some variation of it.

It was interesting though that he said he saw pythons that were not in the wild… Maybe they stopped at nature center on the way home?"

TheColdPodcast,fozfq9n,t1_fovubxc,1588189896.0,"I agree with you on all points, just your first point doesn’t seem to really add up to me. Do you think that Josh suddenly felt threatened by Susan because of her good relationship with her boys? Like that she was keeping them from him? Why at that point and not earlier? Do you think he saw Susan as an outsider from the beginning? It kind of mirrors what happened with his own mom… How often do you see the kids all ending up with a dad and not with the mom? How is it that all of the siblings except for Jennifer stuck with Steven? What caused him to have such a loyalty to him?"

I suggest you try your best for the sake of your children to make the divorce amicable.
Your kids’ lives are being turned upside down. They are the losers here. 
It seems like you are looking for some way to “stick it to her” with the help of your lawyer. This seems very scumbaggy if you ask me.
Best thing for you and your wife is to show respect for one another, your kids don’t want to see her bashing you and they don’t want to see you bashing her. Pull it together, you are the adults.
And sleeping in the bed is least of your son’s problems. At 10 years old, needing reassurance and closeness from parents is NORMAL, especially given the circumstances. 

Think back to when you were 10. What did you need from your parents? Did you get it? What would you have wanted as a 10 year old whose parents were divorcing in a nasty way? Think about it and try to be a good dad."
