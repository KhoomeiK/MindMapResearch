Fully recovered for me would be not thinking about snack/eating 100% of the time...even way back there in the back of my mind. Forgetting, even, to eat because I'm so involved in what I'm doing. 

Fully recovered would mean eating a bagel with cream cheese (everything bagel, since we're dreaming here) and just going on with my day. It was breakfast...now on to the next thing. NOT feeling the need to move enough to compensate for that or scrimp on carbs/calories elsewhere in the day to make up for it. 

Fully recovered would mean not worrying about how late dinnertime is...would mean eating a REAL meal with my husband and son after 5:30 and not purging it up. 

Fully recovered would mean not checking out the menu for a restaurant online before going there. There would be no need to have a strategy for eating...just picking what LOOKS BEST. 

Fully recovered would mean eating popcorn at nighttime while watching a movie with my husband. 

Fully recovered would mean not self-checking my tummy bloat several times a day. 

Fully recovered would mean being able to sit still. I am in constant motion and even though I'm not THINKING that sitting still is lazy and pooling calories/fat instead of spending it, I'm confident that these are the reasons my subconscious animal makes me move all the time. 

Fully recovered would mean sleeping in...like I did in high school. Till I woke up for good. Not GETTING up because it's o'dark-30 and I need to start doing the things and covering the bases and spinning the wheels of progress...all part of the same subconscious machine as the reply above. 

Fully recovered would mean rest."

If you're quarantined like the rest of us, perhaps you can even take on chores or rearranging your room. Help out someone else in the house with THEIR task that requires movement. Keep things processing through your body and two things'll happen:

1. It'll process faster. Metabolize the food, the liquids, literally your lymphatic system flowing better with the movement, movements squeeze things through your digestive system. All of these things happen behind-the-scenes more efficiently when you move than when you are at total rest. If your recovery is requiring you to scrutinize amount of exercise, then just do these things gently and slowly. No speed and vigor necessary. 
2. It'll keep your mind and your attention off of the bloat. I get in a bodycheck vortex and then my tummy/low belly ""thickness"" NEVER seems to go down. But when I focus on something else, parTICularly something productive, and forget about it, I cease the constant checking and VOILA!...hours later when I happen to check again, things have gotten better and I feel better about myself as well.

EDAnonymous,fldo8ad,t3_fo5lsm,1585068462.0,Never thought of that. Damn good idea.
bulimia,fla6l3g,t1_fl8c7f6,1584977730.0,"That's fantastic. Thanks for those thoughts. I b/p between once and three times a day right now...the higher number happening on days when things are stressful, I'm bored or am looking for that ""soothing and empty"" feeling on the other side of the purge. Empty is the best. I eat high calorie foods in the morning (nuts, more nuts, fruit, some granola, multivitamin) and keep that down but come, oh, 2 pm it all hits the fan. I work from home at some volunteer online efforts to am placed in my kitchen whenever I want so the trick is to stay busy. Especially during this CoronaEra. Anyhoo - you've accomplished things to which I can aspire. Will keep at it. Thanks again."

bulimia,fl72t9g,t3_fbm572,1584892876.0,Share any tips? Bravo!
fuckeatingdisorders,fl6kapg,t3_fmm400,1584872814.0,"My stash is for my teen - bagel bites, hot pockets, doritos. Those aren't my personal go-tos. The rest of what we have is practical: frozen proteins, rice, pasta...and I won't cook to b/p. I do have a rather HUGE stash of sugar free gum and am convinced that you can OD yourself into a headache/nausea from the stuff. If I die early it'll be from xylitol, not coronaV."
