ptsd,f1aq0oi,t3_d8cluv,1569302163.0,I don’t. Quite the opposite. Which is really difficult when you realize you can’t change how other people are gonna make you feel. It makes me want to be around people until I am - and then they do something minor that triggers me and I can’t say anything because it genuinely wasn’t their fault. I bite my tongue OR go into a full episode. I have this crippling need for love and friends I can’t seem to shake loose

People get nervous when I wax them their first time, but once I was waxing this woman’s “behind” strip, and as soon as I pulled, it must have really shocked her, because a small turd absolutely flew out onto my glove.
