happy,fn5cwh0,t3_fzjrrf,1586661599.0,Congratulations. I’ve gone through that and I know how you feel. Getting out of any type of relationship that doesn’t bring you something constructive/positive into your own life shouldn’t be there.

MadeMeSmile,fg6zycx,t3_ex75vg,1580580771.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. I remember the video about you and your daughter changing your last name to Watson and it’s one of my favorite things in this world. Hope you and your family are well, and again, I’m so sorry. He looked like an awesome man and dad."

happycrowds,f2tfilf,t1_f2tdxme,1570394315.0,"You’re absolutely right, mate, not rude at all. I legitimately wanted to know what exactly is that you thought you were doing by sharing such a profound opinion. You know what, I hope life gets better for you and you finally enjoy a Reddit that’s is only filled with non-animalistic celebrations.

PS. I would suggest staying away from anything that includes a crowd, a stadium of any sort, maybe concerts, too? Idk. Just saying."
happycrowds,f2tckul,t1_f2tbdwb,1570393230.0,"I accept different opinions. What I don’t understand/accept is why you had the need to be so rude to everyone that likes this. I enjoy more of a quiet good time myself, yet I don’t go commenting how “animalistic” any other type of fun is. The one getting offended is you, mate. Chill, if you don’t like something just keep scrolling. Passive-aggressive comments to ensure people know you feel like you’re above others (because that’s how you’re coming off on your original comment) aren’t necessary."
happycrowds,f2t88y6,t1_f2t7wqo,1570391791.0,"Whoa! What’s up your ass, buddy? Nobody has been giving you attention until now and that’s why you’re over compensating and being a bit of a dick?"
