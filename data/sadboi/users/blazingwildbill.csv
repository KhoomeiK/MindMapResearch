BipolarReddit,fr20lnj,t3_gm3rzk,1589829107.0,"I do everyday, I vape oil. It's definitely higher in THC but for some reason it seems to help me most of the time. I use it daily, only after 7pm except weekends sometimes it's a little earlier. I do what I need to before vaping because if makes me more tired, and introspective.  I don't smoke to a crazy extent, I make a 1/4 last 2.5 months+. Flower seemed to differ more in strains. Without lithium I don't do well with it however. Might be self justification, but it does seem to lessen my side effects. During deep depression and early stages of mixed/hypo I cut back, mania I stop entirely. 

As all the others have said it varies by the person, just as abilify works great for some but not me. If you find it's not helping, taper down slowly. Statistically, it does worsen bipolar outcomes, especially heavy use. Compared to alcohol, it's not as destabilizing for me. 

I'm not a doctor, I'm not a person who really knows you (I do care and emphathise with all my bipolar peeps though!), only you can make this kind of decision. The chances of it helping medically are slimmer than it worsening, but it gives my mind a break, a different perspective I guess. Either way, be cautious and recognize if it is worth doing and what benefits you hope to gain."

The more you put into a relationship, the more time and love that you invest in it, the higher up on the scale you are. If you have a casual relationship, doesn't last too long, you only really hit a 6, and so the rebound after puts you at about a 4. If you have a happy marriage lasting most of your lifetime and that crumbles, you were at a solid 10 and the rebound will be way harder, you may never return to a 5.

From closest to furthest: 

If you go out to Chesapeake, Ipswich is pretty good for mountain biking but has some more challenging trails and a two jump sections, a small pump track and a path with side features on it. Unfortunately there's only a few months left for the back half as the city sold the property to build a neighborhood back there.

The best place I've found semi-close is freedom park in James City county (Williamsburg). They have a ton of trails and trail C is a feature trail, but has loop arounds for every feature if you aren't into it.

Richmond is world-class mountain biking trails, some of the best on the east coast. I have yet to go out there yet though but there's YouTube videos on it to give you an idea."

The basic premise is that we have been bombarded with decisions in current life vs our ancestors. The author is a university professor who ran a little experiment at the campus with fruit jams. He offered free samples of every type, and they sold much more when only selling six types vs 30 types. The essence of the book is that when we are presented with a lot of options, our brain struggles to find the best option so we default to making no decision at all. 

10/10 great book, it's in my top 3 I've read in my life."
DrugNerds,flh6822,t3_folgfo,1585156840.0,"I experienced psychosis first hand, and cannabis may have been a catalyst that sparked it, along with the highest stress levels I've had to date, but I have since also experienced psychosis in absence of using it. After my second psychotic break/hospitalization I saw an outpatient psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar. Even though I realized the psychotic breaks were 90% due to bipolar, which I would have developed anyways, marijuana may have sped up the process but there's no empirical way to tell. 

My work break is over, will resume writing after I get off."
