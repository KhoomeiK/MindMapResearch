AskReddit,fpxoaxq,t3_gg57e9,1588986323.0," Lack of facial symmetry may reveal true feelings as the left-facing side of a persons face better reveals how they currently feel than their other side due to the lessened ability of their brain's right hemisphere to express or censor their true feelings. Their left hemisphere is better in tune with public relations and changing their face to the happy go luck person they want to project. Like a public relations team.

Don't believe it? Try taking a full-on picture, then cover each side of that person's face vertically and it is impossible not to see the difference. the right facing side is usually less capable of hiding how they truly feel.

The seed of this theory comes from split brained epileptic patients who have had their corpus callosum completely cut, cutting, along with it, the two hemispheres ability to communicate. Meanwhile, the right hemisphere has less ability to use language, the primary means of communication for the other side of your brain.

Note: While considering this theory remember each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body."

Maybe it costs more than cold turkey, but it's working. FYI - I use Element Vape Company mail order and use a Aegis Mod with a Falcon King Tank and Naked brand Apple Cooler. Cost about $40 per month on average, about $260 less than cigarettes.
