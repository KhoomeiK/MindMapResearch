I think your sister is in her ""teenage years"" or ""awkward age"" or whatever way it's called. She'll have to change and mature at some point, right? 

Does your sister have a bad relationship with your parents? Maybe it's something related to the US? Are you used to verbal violence? Tell her to chill and ignore her, when you're fighting, that is."

I don't know how can your sister manipulate your parents, but the thing is they want your sister evicted.  She just can't stay in your parents house and have the nerve to shout at your parents or steal!

Maybe do it without her finding out? Because you can't confront her without her flipping out."

depression,fmrxqel,t3_fwvc42,1586339383.0,"You mean selfish as in self-centered?  In that case, I feel the same way, or at least I can relate.  

How about you tell the people you trust about this very problem (your post)?  My teacher told me there was nothing wrong for being self-centered. But of course, I didn't believe what she said.

Maybe you're afraid of people misjudging you.  

Maybe you've talked about you're problems too much and you're seeing people are starting to irritate whenever you talk(ed) about your issues. Have you thought about a therapist? Therapists don't jugde, right? Or maybe you can't afford one? Where do you live? I live in Spain and when the virus is beaten I'll go to a free group therapy. I'm underage, that's why it's free. Anyway, I hate talking about myself in front of other people, it makes me feel the same way you feel. I always thought it was an ego problem. Don't know if I'm right or wrong, though.

So yeah, maybe you can ask your people how do they feel whenever you bring up your problems? And ask them to be honest (as in expecting they're fed up)?

Oh! What about this? You can tell them: I talk about me, you talk about you, and we both try together to solve our problems? 

Sorry if I didn't help you."
