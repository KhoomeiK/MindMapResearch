I delt with the same shit from narsassistic family, for 14+ years. It ended up with me attempting suicide multiple times. I'm better now though and taking medication along with counseling to deal with trauma. I know exactly how this feels. I live with my fiance and our beautiful baby now. But back then as a kid were darker times. I'm so glad I'm an adult now."

raisedbynarcissists,f0ne15f,t3_d5otdd,1568767594.0,I have them all the time. I'm an adult and live with my significant other and I have dreams of hanging myself in my bedroom at the house I grew up in and no one caring that I was dead. I also have had dreams about shooting my abusers point blank between the eyes and walking away without crying.
