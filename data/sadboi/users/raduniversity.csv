AmItheAsshole,fr2zfhi,t1_fr2iov3,1589846881.0,Lmfaoooooo you say no one will remember it even though you remember it. Nice one chief. She had no way of knowing what the school would do. This is not on her. She reported the behavior but she didn’t choose the consequences. That was the schools decision. There is no one to blame here but her sister.
AmItheAsshole,fr23kpz,t1_fr22ywk,1589830554.0,Idk about you dude but I distinctly remember everyone who bullied me and what they did to me. It severely damaged how I view myself to the point where I needed intense therapy. So that “nobody was going to remember in a week” is total bullshit. Nobody deserves to be bullied and her sister doesn’t deserve to be rewarded for her shitty actions.
AmItheAsshole,fr21iwp,t1_fr218zq,1589829553.0,That’s fair
AmItheAsshole,fr20vwi,t1_fr1zpl4,1589829239.0,It wasn’t just to OP. It was multiple people. You really think someone should be rewarded for being such a major asshole?
AmItheAsshole,fr20rb9,t1_fr1zc72,1589829180.0,Aren’t valedictorians supposed to exhibit exemplary behavior in addition to getting good grades? Because that is the exact opposite of what she did.
AmItheAsshole,fr20j6r,t3_gm77e5,1589829076.0,NTA especially because she was bullying MULTIPLE PEOPLE. Your parents didn’t do anything and schools often encourage students to come forward about this kind of thing. She thought she could be a jerk to all these people and face no repercussions. You did the right thing and hopefully she’ll learn to think twice about being a bad person.

What I really like about it is that I can use it to rinse out a period cup. I wasn’t really able to get one before, mostly because of money, but also my mom hated the idea of me rinsing it in the sink. So now I have a bit more of a push to try and get one since she can’t make that argument anymore lol"

I sometimes feel insecure in my relationship because I don’t feel like I’m good enough for my bf compared to other people he’s been with.
