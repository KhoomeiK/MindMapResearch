The evil that a disembodied person can do is staggering. A disembodied person is one that is not self-aware because they are not healed. Societal wounds (patriarchy), personal wounds (trauma), groupthink, plain weakness, or a bit of all of these create an anti-choice person (not to generalize though - exceptions always exist, everywhere).

It's utterly frightening to consider how unwholesome a person has to be inwardly, to shame a female rape victim. Not only to shame, but to attempt to control her. Attempt to hurt her further via torture. I bet that in such a person there's been a lack of:

\- Therapy

\- Introspection / self-awareness
