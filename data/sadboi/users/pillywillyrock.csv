vegan,f9dgtx8,t3_e4mimk,1575233406.0,"I had this same thought when my school charged me an extra DOLLAR for soy milk. It’s pisses me off that sooo many people really believe milk and other animal products are cheap! When In reality it costs more to make, it costs people their health, and it costs the planet. We need to end animal product subsidies!"

vegan,f9db22l,t3_e4monn,1575231833.0,Try using Cronometer to make sure you are getting in enough calories! For me the biggest adjustment going vegan was making myself eat A LOT. You can set a goal weight on the app and then you enter the foods you eat throughout the day and it tells you what you need more/less of! Good luck<3

vegan,f8ddny1,t3_e0bikm,1574486626.0,"I’m 17 too and i just embraced veganism on world vegan day so I’m overflowing with motivation. The rest of my family eats meat and my mom said she is not willing to cook plant based so I’ve been learning how to make easy vegan food from YouTube! 
I’m actually looking forward to cooking my own food everyday its not nearly as hard as i imagined. And I’ve never cooked my own food in the past btw! 
You should check out the avant-garde vegan, Rachel ama, sweet potato soul, simnett nutrition. There are thousands of vegan you tubers who have helped me immensely, i feel like they are my friends lol. Also plant based news is a good YouTube channel and they also have a podcast which i love"
