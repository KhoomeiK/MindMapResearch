Maybe 20minutes pass, I looked 3 more times thoroughly, just when I become complacent, frustrated because I know I should see them but looked a thousand times in the same small space. Next thing, POOF! I look at the table and there they are. Roll of glue dots right there. There is no reason. Except I requested the delivery.
(now my ocd has to check. Whew, glue dots still on table.)"
