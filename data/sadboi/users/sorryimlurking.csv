internetparents,flmp4r4,t1_flmd0iw,1585291013.0,"Thanks for responding. I have pretty severe asthma so I probably am considered high risk for severe disease. I’m in ct, USA so it’s not the worst place to be, but still essentially on lockdown. I probably shouldn’t go out and make contact with anyone really. and for savings i have about $1500, it’s really not much. 

I recently moved out of my parents house into my own apt (dec 2019) so I won’t be receiving a stimulus check as they claimed me as a dependent on 2019 taxes... which is unfortunate for me but fair on their part. I most likely will be getting a refund but I’m honestly not sure. My parents have all my W2s for 2019 to file with their accountant for the aforementioned reason. 

I have 2 more paychecks from work coming, so I’ll be doing a large grocery shop tomorrow and hoping what I can get from costco will last."

UCONN,ewkue06,t1_ewkovbp,1565494900.0,"I lived in Knollwood for two years and can confirm NO ONE will look outside and notice a car there, let alone report you. The property management is also... really bad, to put it gently. They issued warnings to move our cars when they plowed the lot and threatened tickets, but of course nobody moved their cars and I didn’t see a single ticket in the complex. Also, the buildings are 4 units, so a single extra car in front of a building with a mostly empty lot in front is not suspicious at all. Just try to park away from the sidewalks, I always got annoyed when someone took my close-to-the-apartment spot, lol."
