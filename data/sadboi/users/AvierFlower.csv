Even if you and your partner are ok with this after talking to a therapist there's some damage there that would need worked on. If you confront them about being controlling and it doesn't go well I would say it's not meant to be. Now for the medical bit, the Spiro will keep your testosterone suppressed but this isn't meant to be a long term solution as the body needs a certain level of hormones to remain healthy.

This creates blocks and confusion within the community so you are absolutely gatekeeping. Spreading of these ideals alienates and denies therefore keeping people from reaching who they are."
asktransgender,fo0h0j2,t1_fo0ewd2,1587412977.0,"Mine is silkin which is nothing special I got it because it had a two year guarantee at 200 USD. But there are several different types of lasers and all of the approved at home ones are basically watered down versions of the salon. You need to be thinking about power, skin tone (many specifically state not for mid-darker tones) and quality/long lasting. Some are refillable, some are not. There's battery charged and outlet chorded.  They will all say ""omg it so strong"" it's bs, look into recognizing what specific type of laser it is and how much it is. Unless you're planning on getting a really strong one there's not going to be much strength difference between the lower tiers."
asktransgender,fo0734j,t3_g4tmll,1587407226.0,"From my understanding salon has much more effective equipment ,but my at home laser has been working, slowly but surely. The at homes are better cost wise and now that everything is shut down.. also with my laser I can zap before I go out and it keeps my stubblies down all day. I have no idea about electrolysis but my laser is awesome."
