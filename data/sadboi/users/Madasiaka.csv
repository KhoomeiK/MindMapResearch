ebikes,foz45n1,t1_foynypa,1588184378.0,"I haven't fully replaced my car with this bike, but it's close. 

My daily commute is ~20 mi round trip and it takes me about 15 minutes longer total on the bike than driving and hitting mild traffic. The multiuse trail I use has a 15 mi/hr limit. I cheat it a bit in winter when it's dark out and I know no one else will be out, but rarely try to push the bike to it's max 28 limit even on roadways. It feels solid going that fast though.

I love that it's essentially a bike, which sounds stupid but hear me out. The components on it are solid quality and she rides like a normal (albeit heavy) bike when the motor is off. I can have assist off and average 16mph on flats comfortably. I've ridden several cheaper e-bikes before (mostly RAD) and its obvious that the electric assist is an essential part of how they function. There's significant drag if you turn the assist off, and the cadence sensing assist is kind of clunky/noticeable. 

She hauls well. The built in rack is racktime, which specializes in easy attach bags. I got a large basket and pannier set off Craigslist for ~$40 and have carried everything from a full weeks of groceries (including beer) to a bag with everything I need for a weekend trip.

She handles fine off-road, but I haven't done anything wilder than cutting through some fields or taking what turned out to (surprise) be a narrow hiking trail. 

My complaints are mostly directed at Specialized's website/misinformation. I think the range of the battery is smaller than they claim, but they seem to have removed the range calculator from the site. I'm heavier (230lbs) and spend a decent amount of time on no assist and get ~40 miles with help up the hills and some low assist. The website claimed closer to 60 miles with my settings. The ""up to 90 miles"" general claim seems laughable.

There's also some drama over the computer tech Specialized promised vs what was delivered. Apparently all their turbo bikes EXCEPT the vado moved over to a Bluetooth enabled unit that allows you to customize the motor output through an app, and has built in GPS. The website promised it for the Vados for about half the year, they did some upgrades post market on the 2018 models as shown in the reviews, then the website stopped promising it except some vague language about problems with their suppliers. My LBS thought it had the new computer when they sold it to me, but afterwards had to apologize and say it would actually be $400 + labor to change it. I don't think I would have decided against the bike knowing that, but it was off-putting and there are several reviews now that mention being jerked around similarly.

I do wish there was a bit of suspension in the back. My next upgrade will probably be a suspension seat post of some type.

Overall, hugely happy with the bike! Picked her up on end of season sale for 40% off and would do it again."
