schizophrenia,flyy41q,t1_fku4cn0,1585611473.0,that’s the first thing i thought of too
schizophrenia,flyxvi9,t1_flxf22i,1585611333.0,"thank you! i’m not really sure actually, i wasn’t exactly in the clearest state of mind when i did it so i guess it’s just a reflection of how i was feeling at the time"

schizophrenia,flwjqrj,t3_frir9n,1585553231.0,"\- walls, floors and ceilings breathing

\- seeing bugs crawling on my walls and on my body (as well as feeling them in & on my body)

\- eyes going black in the mirror

\- hearing my roommate screaming in the bathroom on multiple occasions

\- a blue or purple hue going over everything i see

\- hearing dishes breaking

\- hearing my cat screaming even when she's sitting right next to me and i can see she isn't

\- hearing screaming, voices, static, carnival music, and laughter in my head

\- internal voices telling me to kill myself every day with what's in whatever room i'm in

those are the main ones. a lot of my delusions align with these as well. i often think my cat is dying or being hurt, as well as my roommate. i also have the general sense that nothing is real almost constantly. it's really hard to shake. the depth perception thing is interesting and i can imagine that would be really hard to deal with. i also have experienced the movement and shadows in my peripheral like you described. i can see how it could just be described as an optical illusion but also i personally feel like if it happens consistently and it's a disturbance it's something more than just an illusion"
schizophrenia,flwj1xg,t3_frlaxg,1585552488.0,"it’s better to be open and completely honest as soon as possible!! I was afraid of the same thing so I told my friend all of my symptoms first and let her come to the same conclusion as well rather than saying what I thought I had first, same with my psychiatrist eventually. don’t let that stop you from getting help if you think you need it. good luck!"

schizophrenia,flwbm51,t1_flw75x6,1585545231.0,how long in your opinion is a good time to see if something is working for me? i’ve been experiencing side effects for weeks but no benefits and i’m not sure how long i’m supposed to wait it out. i guess my psych can tell me too but i have trouble trusting medical professionals

schizophrenia,flhsh01,t3_foudz4,1585168656.0,"I didn’t realize I was hallucinating when it actually started. I started to hear my roommate screaming every time she would take a bath and would run to ask her if she was alright but she wasn’t making any noise. by the third time or so I realized that something was going on and I was really scared. I started to think a lot of things I was seeing or hearing weren’t real so I was sort of just living in constant fear. I was diagnosed about a month later and I have pretty high insight so it doesn’t scare me so much anymore but it is really distressing still, even though I know what’s going on"

I even hear it on ""good days"" sometimes and like you said,  there's no reason I'd think that on my own but I still can't shake the feeling sometimes that I'm just making it all up. it's a shame that this seems to be common, almost like some sort of twisted imposter syndrome. I'm so sorry that you have these feelings too but it really does make me feel better too knowing that it isn't just me! hugs"

schizophrenia,fkwuxec,t1_fkwslg3,1584606922.0,i actually have a weighted blanket already and i really like it. mine is 20 pounds but they make them lighter. i honestly wish mine were heavier sometimes. i’ve heard that music helps people but for some reason i’ve always been scared to listen to music i like during an episode because i thought i’d ruin it forever or something but i think i’m finally going to give it a try

schizophrenia,fks91v9,t3_fk8vu2,1584484868.0,"I have high insight which is frustrating at times because I know these things are happening to me and I understand that it's not normal but it doesn't make it feel any less real. I experience visual, audio, and tactile hallucinations, paranoid delusions, disorganized thinking, and avolition most prominently.

it's kind of hard to explain how I can have delusions while also having high insight and how I can know at times that I'm delusional but still maintain those beliefs; but the best way I can put it is that I know that a delusion is a delusion when I'm afraid to tell anyone about those beliefs and I'm often terrified of letting something about them slip out on accident because I know they wouldn't understand.

I've had some pretty bad episodes, but the one that effected me the most was was probably not even the scariest, it just stuck with me more than any of the others for some reason. one night I went into the bathroom and saw my eyes go completely black in the mirror. to me that was confirmation that I wasn't schizophrenic but possessed by demons and that's why all of this was happening to me. that night I was with my best friend and I was crying and refused to open my eyes in front of her because I thought she would see the black too. it really scared her and I think that's why it effected me so much. this was a while ago and I honestly still believe deep down that demonic possession could be the reason for all of this despite the fact that I've never believed in god."
