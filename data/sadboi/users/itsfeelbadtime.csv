trashy,foudk70,t1_fou77t5,1588081989.0,Thats fair. I think its more so being connected to great people who did great things. Maybe not you yourself but looking back in history and knowing that you decend from them; youre apart of them.. Gives me motivation to try to live up to a better standard. I think it's pride in trying to make your ancestors proud. I mean you can be proud to be a parent when your child does something amazing that you didnt personally teach them.
