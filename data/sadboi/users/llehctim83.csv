childfree,flkcjuk,t3_fpdsga,1585238348.0,"I posted this to Facebook a while back. I thought I had posted to a private child free group. I didn't. I also got a little tipsy at Thanksgiving. Then preceded to say to my 20 year old cousin (who is a fence sitter) that I don't think having children is ethical. Especially in the world we live in today. I wasn't as quiet as I thought. Ever since, I get the stink eye when I see my other cousin. Who has 3 kids and had a newborn at Thanksgiving. Sorry for rambling on. Possibly because I haven't talked to anyone in a bit.
