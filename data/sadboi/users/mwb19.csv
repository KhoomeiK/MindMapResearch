ptsd,fqivuc0,t3_gj65hb,1589401578.0,I just got my results back from failing a clinical biochem exam because of having horrible flashbacks mid exams.. fight it. If you have proof of your diagnosis or can get a doctors note then use that as proof. When it comes to your future don’t let ptsd be the bane of all your hard work.

xxfitness,fofvvaz,t3_g76k2r,1587743729.0,Oh I absolutely loved it! I liked how every trainer had different disciplines in fitness and it didn’t make you feel like one was better than the others but showed their transformation even if they lost the contest.
Tricking,fobh54a,t3_g6ptow,1587659745.0,On that second step don’t extend your leg out so much. You still want it slightly bent but if your heel is far out like that you won’t get enough kick off and might even slip or hurt you leg! Keep at it :)
BPPV,fo777s0,t1_fo6ya7x,1587573443.0,Not tmi at all haha don’t worry. That makes sense though! I’d imagine something like it getting worse before it gets better with the whole shifty crystals thing. Especially doing them by yourself! Do you find some things help you ground yourself before you start? Or is it kinda like ripping the bandaid off?
BPPV,fo6xftm,t1_fo6wotk,1587568525.0,That’s really interesting. Do you find that the panic attacks worsen after you do the maneuvers yourself? I’m sorry if I’m asking too much questions lol also I really appreciate you posting and sharing your experiences. I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be
BPPV,fo6soy8,t3_g5ysc9,1587565984.0,I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Do you mind me asking do you usually have someone help you with the Epley maneuvers or do you do it yourself?
Hair,fm4e2q8,t3_fsxb11,1585752300.0,I think it looks absolutely sick! And the fact that each phase of cut suits you is nice
Tricking,fm4dmsz,t3_ft0uce,1585752049.0,I notice when you land on your left leg on the first kick it almost looks like your leg gave in a little which hindered the force of your next move. I’d suggest practicing the basic kicks and gain a bit more strength and balance in the legs. Also the force of each move is pertinent when you are in transition to the next move. Might be daunting at first but for a beginner it always is. Keep at it!

ptsd,fle6pzg,t1_fldlmco,1585078625.0,"I understand. I definitely don’t see crutch as having negative connotation nor do I see weed as something “negative” cause it helped me extremely with the self harm and consistent thoughts. Lol I haven’t had much therapy and don’t know how they use the term, but I did work as a medical staff and see a crutch as something to aide you whilst you heal. Weed is the same for me. 

I’ve tried a few so far and am always advised the side effects will subside but weeks, months after I’d still have horrible anxiety that I didn’t otherwise have before, and constant thoughts about just ending it all. I figured I’d be better off until maybe I can’t start therapy? I know it’s trial and error with it as you’ve mentioned. 

Will definitely look into them. I think I’d benefit from the face to face seeing as I don’t even think I actively said out loud what had happened to me when I disclosed. I’d just set it up and the person would just know where it’s going and stop me. I feel like that’s pushed me back as well from trying to do anything about it. Thanks for this, best of luck!"
ptsd,fldff2p,t1_flbtlxu,1585063439.0,"I appreciate the response. Yeah for years it’s been really hard trying to put it in words. 

When it comes to therapy I’m currently on a 9-month waiting list. I’ve been prescribed antidepressants but hate how they make me feel, which is why I think I used weed as a crutch. I’m trying to see what I could do in the meantime and will see about online support groups (which if you have any recs would love them). 

Hearing how you fought this and stabilized definitely has given me some hope! All the best in your journey :)"

chemhelp,finttot,t1_finpqzr,1582570038.0,"This cleared things up so much! Especially about the LCs being cheaper because we also have to write up a mock cost analysis and explain why this approach is more cost efficient. If at all you know of any papers that might help with the research Id greatly appreciate it. Or anything in general to read up on. I genuinely want to have a better grasp at analytical chemistry.

About the plasma kinetics those were my thoughts. I’ll have to speak to my professor about that."
chemhelp,finec8z,t1_find0vd,1582561811.0,"I think what they want is validation methods for drug tracing by way of plasma. For example determining total drug related chlorine and bromine contents in human plasma by way of HPLC-ICP-mass spec. (Which was the paper that prompted this gap of knowledge)


Unfortunately that’s all I was given to go off of. The other gap of knowledge they provided was “what is the most suitable validation strategy to develop an analytical method for measuring urinary metabolites of novel chlorinated drug candidates” I figured since the percentage of drugs that contain chlorine isn’t that high that I’d go with the gap of knowledge stated above."

unpopularopinion,ezy1nhd,t3_d2tx0j,1568255276.0,"Also the fact that they make you take certain classes in order for you to get to the one you actually need on your transcript to obtain a degree. For example in order to take Anatomy or human bio for that matter you must take Biology1(which is essentially the same level bio class you took in 10th grade) then gen bio just to get to the class you actually need. 

Meanwhile you’re wasting semesters and countless dollars on classes you already took in high school. Here’s the kicker though in some universities and community colleges they end up changing requirements often so by the time you’re actually done with the prereq classes you’ll have to add another to the mix. 

It’s honestly become a guise just to keep people in this loop of paying for classes they don’t need."

BlackHair,eu5xaq8,t3_cew3r7,1563487472.0,"I always go by the tip: moisturizer first, oil second. The oil seals in the moisture! If you use heat to dry your hair try a diffuser to minimize the frizz. And if you use gel try to find one that doesn’t contain a high concentration of alcohol seeing as it de-moisturizes the scalp making the hair weaker and can easily break. 

Wish you all the luck ☺️"
