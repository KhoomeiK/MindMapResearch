I think having worst case scenario in your mind is good so you are aware of it and then you can think of ways to avoid it and/or what to do if it actually happens.

StopGaming,eyfcyo4,t3_cwguz0,1567046903.0,"I had the exact problem with you before I was able to quit! I've played since the game's beta and quitted at the end of OWL S1 which is like.. Competitive Season 12? Though nowadays I've gotten back to play with friends because of role queue, but I don't play it religiously like before. 

The reason why Overwatch is so much addictive is in the game design. For me, the movement of the characters is the thing that makes me addicted because I like fast-paced movement stuff. Since movement in Overwatch has no acceleration, it feels so much more fluid and more fun than games like, say, CS:GO. Another thing is with the competitive setting. Sure, everytime I win, it always feels good so of course that adds up to it. But the really addictive stuff is when you lose, and you keep telling yourself ""I could've done better and win that game! Let's do one more until I hit x milestone (e.g ""Let's do one more since I'm at 2980 SR"")

But the game design is also what drives me away from the game. How they designed characters and how some completely disables the others and how in most metas only a certain number of heroes from a large pool can be played, making it very repetitive. The game being very team-reliant turns me off because the team that you get affects 70% to your chances of winning, so you could be playing out of your mind and still lose.

That's how I managed to avoid this game. I keep reminding myself that whatever you do, it doesn't really matter since you need to rely on strangers to be able to win, and I don't feel like that is a fun thing to do. Also because of how repetitive the game is because I can't play more than x number of heroes at a given meta."

NoFap,ey51gjr,t3_ckgjpv,1566818339.0,"Been thinking about this challenge for a while, and have actually tried it several times but failed everytime and only getting 1 week off. Figured I might need some help, at least a support system, so I decided to join in! For now I'll be doing some Normal Mode (PM) since I have already planned some sexual activities with my partner but will go PMO after that. I will target the recommended days and will try my best to commit to it.  


The reason I'm doing this is because I have a really bad issue with porn addiction and it's been chipping away at my brain every day. I've been doing this for about 8 years and now I thought to myself that it's time to stop. The addiction is so bad that everytime I do something that is not masturbating/watching porn/gaming, I will feel desperate and just generally awful. But now, I will try to push through those desperations and come out clean.

&#x200B;

That's it for my rants, now it's time for me to make a change for myself."
