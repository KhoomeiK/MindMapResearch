It took me two decades to find a good shrink and yet she still needed to refer me to a psychologist after she set my meds. Doctors primarily want to stabilise you with drugs. To help you change the way you think or process emotions, strategies to cope etc requires a psychotherapist or similar. Shrinks and therapists are seldom the same person."

NoStupidQuestions,fa0mbkd,t1_f9z1ol6,1575757248.0,"This is a tough one to answer and a question I share myself. You are right that the state of Israel is practicing racism at the fundamental level based on how they treat Palestinians and their complete disregard for the rightful existence and sovereignty of Palestine. They are driven at the core by Zionism, which grew steam in the 1800s, not coincidentally, at the time when the Ottoman Empire was losing control of the region. Zionism is the belief that Jews have a god given right to Zion, the land of ancient Israel. Nothing should get in their way of winning back this land, no matter who lives there or rightfully owns it through historic events.

The British, who had a vested interest in the region, fuelled the Zionist belief as part of a divide and conquer strategy. See, under Ottoman rule, Jews, Muslims, Christians and other denominations lived in harmony. It was a thriving economic, multicultural and multi religious community. How does an evil coloniser like the British then seek to control a region that was thriving under the current ruler? Well, the British made agreements with both Palestine and Jews, promising each the world if only they sided with them against the Ottomans. When the Ottomans were driven out, their treachery was uncovered. They promised the growing Zionist movement their rightful land of Israel and promised the Palestinians that their sovereignty would be restored. This drove a wedge between the two and the intra-state volatility got worse and worse in the next few decades.

Then World War II happened and the world felt sorry for the Jews. Anti-semitism became politicised at international level and within countries that were greatly affected. As you pointed out, it is even defined by the IHRC. These are all measures to prevent something like the holocaust from happening again. The state of Israel was practically handed to them through a UN treaty at the expense of Palestine. Sadly, this also became a bulletproof shield for Zionists who now comprise the majority of Israeli government and they have pushed and pushed the Palestinians to the fringes ever since.

Now back to anti-semitism. The term Semite was derived from descendants of Shem, son of Noah. He was considered the next prophet after Noah who believed in a one true god (monotheism). It‚Äôs important to note that Semites include Jews and Arabs. Anti-semitism to refer specifically to persecution of Jews is a modern terminology.  If you use the original definition of Semite, Jews are anti Semites themselves for persecuting Palestinians because the latter descend from Shem as well.

It‚Äôs all very complicated but in a nutshell, Zionists are protected at all levels and supported by powerful countries like the US. Any critics of Jews are called anti-semites because they can and it is to their best interest to keep on using this terminology because they want the protectionist policies stemming from WWII to continue. Anti-semitism  conjures images of the holocaust and this benefits Israel‚Äôs agenda. IMHO, the current definition of anti-semitism should be made obsolete."
