EatingDisorders,fi88bdw,t1_fi81sai,1582235325.0,"OP asked for advice, wanting to contact her but unsure because her ED could be ""controlling her"" and he's not sure if he could ""get through to her."" He's unsure if she'll regret this ""sooner or later."" I just think that the reason not to contact her has nothing to do with her eating disorder or if she regrets her decision -- the reason not to contact her is because she asked not to be contacted.

I just hate the tone of this post, like this woman is incapable of making her own decisions and she'll come to her senses and fall back in love with OP. I understand that her ED could be clouding her judgment, even very seriously. But that's not a reason to invade the space she specifically made. 

I feel the pain, OP. I do. Break-ups suck, and this one seems especially complicated. But this woman made her own decision, and part of that was asking specifically for you not to contact her. Respect that decision."

Leave her alone."
