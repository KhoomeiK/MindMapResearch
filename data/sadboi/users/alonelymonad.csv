Psychic,f8qzift,t3_e1i410,1574728147.0,Wow thanks for making this post. Same same it’s been such a tough but also super magical time this fall. My first ex’s friend came into my life briefly and revealed that my ex is a narcissist. (Never really thought about narcissism) and then I figured out my moms also a narcissist. Those are relationships that really damaged me.

socialanxiety,f2ejsl2,t3_dd6qz6,1570197218.0,"I don’t know, I have the same issue. What I’m doing now is trying to talk to myself out loud saying reassuring things like “it’s okay” “we’re going to get threw it” or whatever advice you may need to hear but you can’t say it in your head because there’s to much negative noise and it kinda helps because it feels like your removed from your internal self and it seems like you care about this person that your talking to only it’s yourself and it also makes you remember that that’s what you would tell a friend to help if they needed the help. And I gotta try to remember that you deserve goodness and to feel good just like you would want your friend to even though they aren’t perfect."

confession,f2e2sxl,t3_dd4fn7,1570177296.0,"Sometimes it legitimately hard for me to understand things, I remember in English 101, reading an assigned article something about a philosopher, a cave and an apocalypse. I swear I was thinking like zombie apocalypse the whole time and had no idea what the article was talking about. I even ended writing my response saying I don’t understand anything.  

I read a few Nancy drew books growing up, idk if there’s different Nancy drew books, but these ones were really thin. Also I read captain underpants.

(Edit) also being less smart then everyone else and having social anxiety is not a fun combination. Classes are very discussion oriented and I can’t always get away with saying “I don’t have anything to ad” bcuz ppl in my class get pissed that I never contribute any food for thought or anything interesting. Because I have nothing... sometimes I regurgitate random things that add nothing just to have said something."

AskGirls,eyg6crz,t3_cwx3ek,1567062442.0,"Sorry if this is so stupid I just need advice, I have been really honest with him and but he seems persistent even though I told him I’m not sure I see a future with him he was like well you never know, we should take it day by day type of thing and it doesn’t help that I’m really attracted to him. I’m just not sure if he’s lying, only wants to get in my pants or if I’m right in worrying about his feelings because he’s genuine towards me. I think I need to get to know him more but I’m so scared of wasting my time and looking stupid. That’s because it happened in the past but this guy I met for a brief period a few years ago and now he’s back, so I don’t know much about him because he never revealed much about himself or talked much and apparently he has anger problems. Maybe I already kno it’s a no go but I’m being tested by his dashing good looks and my hornyness. Someone tell me I’m an idiot and I should trust my gut because a part of me feels like I should find a way to empower myself enough to get what I want from, sexy time and cuddles and company, even the other part of me is worried of if he’s worth spending time on, I’m worried he’s secretly a dick and I’m too dumb to see it and I don’t want to share moments with a dick. This is why I’ve keep to myself because I feel I don’t know how to function when other people come into my life, I just want to be more careful and make the right decisions."

socialanxiety,ev2z06v,t3_ci908u,1564186219.0,I realized that the people who think like this I.e the person in my head that I’m constantly worried will judge me negatively is an asshole so why am I making my life harder worrying about how I’m making them feel about me. For example I used to not like showing my feet so I would wear Shoes all the time never Sandler’s. but then I realized what kind of person would be critical of my normal lookin feet and have those thoughts that I think they’ll have? Probably a person that I shouldn’t waste any energy on.

I already had a lot of anxiety and depression and feeling the the whole world was a lie and out to get me made things really worsen. 

Eh not worth worrying over things that are out of your control. Now I focus on positive outcomes and trying to understand the inner world, not the negative end of the world doomsday stuff no mater how real it may be I don’t think it’s worth focusing on because it’s just counterproductive to dwell on too much.
