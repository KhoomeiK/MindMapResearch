EnterTheGungeon,fnnwrqm,t1_fnntye7,1587104152.0,"This run was just incredibly broken. I got that gun in my first chest, and with slinger's synergy each time one my shots hits another it activates a blank and damages the entire room. I then found fat, stout, and heavy bullets, meaning I had incredibly oversized bullets moving way too slow to miss. The cherry on top came in chamber 5 when I found cursula selling cursed bullets and then moments later a demon door leading me to another cursula. 6 things to buy from her for 2.5 curse each plus the curse on the items themselves, with each point of curse giving me a 10% damage boost. All that plus more nonesense and I actually couldn't lose lol. I'm only on half a heart because I chain smoked some cigarettes in hell. In a word, RNGesus.

My advice is to just keep playing haha. It sounds like you still need to unlock slinger. I'd highly recommend rainbow runs, that's how I got him. His passive makes sooo many guns OP, so on the run you only need a couple of gun (really just a boss killer and a room clearer) and the rest of your picks can go to items that make your life easier. I also recommend external sources like the Gungeon wiki to look up things like gun synergies when making your rainbow choices. Keep up the grind, you'll get there and it's worth it.

Happy shooting, fellow gungeoneer"
