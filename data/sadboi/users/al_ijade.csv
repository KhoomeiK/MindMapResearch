depression,ewjbfpi,t3_colx9z,1565464131.0,"Exercise does really help with my mood. Ever since I came off my meds, Iâ€™m trying to get back into running and better food to make myself feel better, but sometimes itâ€™s just so difficult to have that motivation!"
mentalhealth,ewhvmjh,t3_coezb6,1565424720.0,You should get professional help alone to help yourself. Nobody should encourage you not to get help. And I think if he really loves you and wants to be with you he will stay with you and support you through the tough times. Iâ€™m always here to talk more about this if you want because I feel like I let my boyfriend down a lot too because of my insecurities!
depression,ewhvfhn,t3_cof59x,1565424422.0,"I feel the same way too. I guess itâ€™s cus weâ€™re either tired of faking being happy around them, or weâ€™re tired of physically talking and trying so hard to be up beat around them. It could be very normal tho, like we need some down time, time to ourselves to just think and chill out you know?"
depression,ewhv9ow,t3_cofann,1565424187.0,"I always feel like that but putting all the hard work, stress and many tears in actually pay off. Well done! Thatâ€™s amazing, you should be proud of yourself. And as hard as it is to not doubt your ability to do things. I do this all the time but a lot of the times I do end up doing really well!"
socialanxiety,ewhtumt,t3_cof0ok,1565422107.0,"I think you should just go for it because you never know what could come out of it!:) and I really hope it goes well. It should sound exactly how you want it to sound, so Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s perfectly fine."
