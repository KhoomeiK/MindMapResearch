Anxiety,flb8dgo,t1_fla2jle,1584999458.0,Just a quick update. I read some of your comments about this to my coworkers on our break and they were all very touched that you guys think so highly of what were doing :) We really needed the moral boost because this week we were supposed to be closed for spring break and next week we're going to a double shift set up to meet our increased demand. Thank you all for the kind words I hope to update this again down the line :)
Anxiety,fla2jle,t3_fj2y1a,1584975207.0,I work for a company in northern MI that produces food stuff for grocery stores and schools across the US. The past two weeks we've kicked production into high gear in order to send out as much food as possible to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to due to quarantines and school's closing. So far we're providing food to 36 states :)
