FinalFantasy,fhaxgsc,t1_fha5zeo,1581429712.0,"Well there's some factors to consider here,

The first is that there hasn't been a space longer than 6 years between main numbered entries.

The JP release years so far have been; 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 94, 97, 99, 00, 01, 02, 06, 09, 10, and 16. So I don't think we have that much longer to wait, if past history is anything to go by. We might get FFXVI in 2022.

The second consideration is that there are supposedly 2-3 FF related projects, or unannounced projects involving key FF staff being developed right now. So any of those *could* be XVI. But that bit is hearsay, so don't quote me on it.

The last thing is that Square definitely won't want something the scale of FFXVI to compete directly with something like the FFVIIR series. But all that means is no releases in the same year. So with that in mind, we might have the release of one or the other delayed a year at worst.

But FVIIR ep 2 may not even be ready until 2023 anyway. They supposedly want ep 1 to be done before they start ep 2, and 3 years would be a fairly normal dev time.

So IDK for sure, but I imagine we'll have FFXVI sooner than later. Very likely not after the VIIR series is complete."

Dude, I've been reading various comics since the 1980s, and I had no freaking clue who ""birds of prey"" were.

Granted, I was a huge Marvel fanboy and then moved over to manga, having only read Superman and Batman from DC in the 90s. But my point is that if someone heavily exposed to comics in general for decades like myself never heard of them, the general audiences would be totally lost.

And then the costume design didn't look at all like any superhero ever. So even those in the know couldn't make out who most of the characters were from a glance either.

The whole thing seems like a lot of oddball choices to me.

Like, if they'd have called it ""Harley Quin and the Birds of prey"" to begin with, made different costume choices and marketed more like Marvel does, it would probably be a lot bigger than it is right now with no other changes made.

It really doesn't seem like a bad movie, but seriosuly; who the hell knows who birds of prey are? It was set up to fail, IMO."

FinalFantasy,fh9m999,t3_f1xxyl,1581384572.0,"I actually really love FFXIII, because of the chatacters, plot, music, combat and the paradigm system.

I thought of it as an action RPG in reverse; rather than action gameplay with RPG elements, instead it's RPG gameplay with action elements.
I loved the execution. Even back when I imported the JP only demo disc and a friend asked ""what's it like?"" I told him ""imagine if Devil May Cry was turn based, and you got it"". And the liniarity didn't bother me, because I thought of it more in action terms.

Great game, IMO.

FFXIII-2 never really pulled me in like XIII did. There were improvements made, of course, but I didn't like the angle the plot took. And Sarah (or however it's spelled) wasn't a compelling MC for me. Plus monster catching felt out of place. I did like the return of Random encounters (more or less) and the time travel angle reminded me of Chrono Trigger to an extent. Those things just didn't save the game for me.

Lightning Returns is an odd beast, because I love how combat works. It's what I imagine FFXV's combat would have been like in better hands. But everything else is just offputting.

The way stats are built, the story, the time limit. It just feels like a needlessly complicated mess to me. I never got into it. Even after having played the first two games, Lightning still feels like ""too much"" on the first play. IMO, of course.

Honestly  for both XIII-2 and Lightning; if they had plots that grabbed me right away like XIII's did, I would have probably liked them a lot more.

I always have issues with direct sequels to FFs though. X-2 had a great take on a class system and excellent combat. The plot was OK, but progression just felt too unfocused. Like, after a while I just had no clue what I should be doing and lost interest.

Oh well."

Larson has what? Captain Marvel and that horror movie with the all female cast no one liked? Oscar bait? Wow.

In 20 years  Gadot and Weaver will still be huge to some degree. Larson will be forever remembered as ""that lady from Captain Marvel"" and that's about it. Unless fate intervenes and saves her career

residentevil,fh6wjpc,t1_fh6vdpd,1581307926.0,"You're welcome.

Now that I've been thinking about the plot of the series, I realise that 3 of the original 5 games are also vaguely about the same idea; a genius creates something that becomes a legacy for him, but also ends up as his downfall.

Berkin in RE2 created G virus  which obviously mutated him. His daughter, who is also infected, carries on the family name and does good things (as a playable character in RE6) thus actually being a positive legacy for a madman.

Edward Ashford in Code Veronica creates his clone children, one of whom then creates T Veronica virus and mutated Edward with it. His two clone children become his legacy; one of them toiling in obscurity for decades, going mad and torturing the prisoners of Umbrlla while the other experiments on herself to become a monster. They both also die.

Marcus from REO trains Wesker and Berkin, but also creates the T virus and his ""children"" (the leaches). His human protege duo kill him steal his research. His monster children mimic his form and avenge him, causing the very first T virus outbreak.

Seeing all that, it makes me wonder what the conclusion of this story could have been. The building blocks are there in RE5, because Oswell E Spencer created the Wesker children and Umbrella itself. And Albert Wesker obviously has a hand in his end. But then the game gets wacky and fails on following through with what could have been in an effective way. It's like an incomplete series of legacy related stories.

Too bad..."

 Like, most of the original 5 games ended with the line ""it's up to *US* to take out Umbrella!"" Or some variation there of. Also, most of the lore prior to RE4 was all about how Umbrella was evil and possibly planning something. What we got to that end was a random Russian bad guy of the week in a freaking side game who was now somehow magically behind almost everything, and super important and blah,  blah,  blah...
Of course 90% of the fanbase never owned a Wii, so have no clue about this, but whatever, right?

Then the remaining founder of Umbrella (and best main villian candidate, IMO), is killed during a flashback scene in RE5 as a decrepid old man, so they could force Wesker to be a Saturday morning cartoon supervillian.

The series never really got the ending to the umbrella ""saga"" because they decided to just say ""well they went bankrupt,  now here's something completely different"" in RE4's intro. And then they tried a couple bandaids after the fact to retroactively ""fix"" it, more or less."

The bad guys of the first five games are literally handwaved in the intro and that's that. Totally derails the series plot and lore in one swoop. Absolutely worthless game, plot wise.

RE5 tries to fix things, and succeeds to an extent, but does a lot of downright bizarre and silly things (boulder punching in a volcano). RE6 is just fucking silliness from start to finish, the Revelations games *try* to be serious, but are still basically just side stories that don't matter much.  RE7 is a totally stand alone game that ends up trying to move lore in a good direction, but it's entirely too late now.

FinalFantasy,fgyukaw,t1_fgyqh5g,1581187207.0,"Right, because they couldn't use initiative, auto haste and auto protect to start with an advantage, then abuse other abilities, spells  items and junctions to win.

I think that with a lucky break, you're right, but a determined SeeD squad could have a time consuming battle, but win over the FFX cast"
FinalFantasy,fgyqcf0,t1_fgypwli,1581185871.0,"Yeah, and that appliesto everyone, lol. Like, how would FFX's max damage output matter when up against Squall with maxed def?"
Godzillamemes,fgyng7i,t3_f0td3z,1581185050.0,Anyone else reminded of pro wrestler Lex Luger performing his signiture move; the torture rack?.
GODZILLA,fgynag4,t1_fgyflob,1581184994.0,Lol. That was *some* hearburn
Godzillamemes,fgyn2rj,t1_fgyliba,1581184920.0,"Uh, huh.

Admit it: you have that Mothra costume in your closet, ready to go..."
FinalFantasy,fgylqpc,t1_fgyl2hv,1581184596.0,"Except it's a summon, using a spell that both resurrects Cloud and does magic damage to the target. I forget  TBH, but could Noct phase through magic damage?"
FinalFantasy,fgyldek,t1_fgyjkcd,1581184468.0,"Junction stop to status atk.

Land one attack, enemy can't move

Sit there and wear them down a bit

Card the bitch.

Only flaw would be if the enemy got to attack first. But that's just one example.there are other ways FFVIII cast can just instawin."
FinalFantasy,fgyj4c9,t1_fgv7uzg,1581183877.0,"When I said ""gameplay"" I mean ""feats"". And ""plot"" would be ""plot armor"" more or less, lol.

Also, if you want to get technical, FFVIII's entire cast could effectively use junctions to trump anything else in the series. Sheer damage output is meaningless if your attacks heal the person you're attacking, and their attacks on you also heal them."
FinalFantasy,fgyinfh,t1_fgyihc5,1581183721.0,"To further this point, materia combos effectively (or completely) trump any tricks FFXV has to offer. The junction system would as well TBH."
FinalFantasy,fgyihc5,t1_fgy24o5,1581183661.0,"Dude; final attack combined maxed Pheonix materia. Cloud just stands there and then watches while Noct gets fucked up for performing literally *any* attack

Edit: another point is that no summon animations are real time. So as long as one of them got a summon off first  the other is fucked."
residentevil,fguwien,t1_fguvt0n,1581130997.0,"I get that point, but I don't usually think about exploration and puzzles when I think about challenge. I usually think about how hard the action is. RE2 has simpler action and gives you enough ammo to kill every enemy in the whole game twice. The bosses are insanely easy as well. So  providing you don't burn through healing items, you just need time. And strategy guides also negate any challenge puzzles could have.

RE5 is more straightforward, but also takes more effort in combat situations, more complex combat, mismanagement of your AI partner can get you killed and the bosses are notably harder than those in RE2 as well. So I give it a pass for being at least kind of hard. RE5 also has a hard mode that RE2 does not.

Also, 14 year old me beat RE2 10 ways to sunday back in 98, and I thought it was easy then, despite my being a spaz with no attention span.
20 something me had a little trouble with RE5,  because of how demanding the action could be. So I base my opinion largely on that."
residentevil,fgut415,t1_fgrvzsa,1581128819.0,This is pretty accurate. Though I'd argue that original RE2 is the easiest.
