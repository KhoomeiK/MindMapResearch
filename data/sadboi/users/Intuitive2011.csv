The 808s are just wonderful, and easy to transform. Plus they're all in TUNE from the get go. No more fiddling around with tuners. Finally, this and Guitar Rig are a perfect combination for fiery 808s."

This video made me want to make music just because of the money he mentioned. 
I remember downloading a bunch of racked VSTs, Reason, Ableton and FL and then losing interest when my beats didn't sell. The best part is, I can actually go back and listen to my trash beats. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

mvci,fg4aa9p,t1_fg44prd,1580499485.0,"Agreed. There's a reason characters like Dormammu, Zero and Dante are consider so strong. As their ability to set play is stellar. The same goes for characters like Ultron and Gamora."
mvci,fg34ptx,t3_ewelms,1580470215.0,"I think Dante is TT as a support character. I'll list my reasons below:

Guns Super lockdown

The vast majority of his specials are multi hitting and great for combo extension/mix ups

His ability to setup self mix ups post death are really strong, especially if he has stone activation on deck

Can't think of anymore, lol."

Also, I think music is a great check point when you're depressed. Like you can spend the whole day in bed, make one beat, and know you've captured how you felt on that day."
