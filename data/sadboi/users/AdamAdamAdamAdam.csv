I’m not sure whether the clip I’m looking for is from that period or modern because it was quite low quality. It could’ve been filmed on a phone. But the woman did resemble Blanco and has me wondering from what era the clip was filmed."

It wasn’t from a movie it looked like it was recorded on a phone. 

Thanks though!"

Meditation,f0w2r6j,t3_d6vld7,1568997641.0,"I’ve been trying to get back in to meditation recently after finding it more and more difficult, having experienced trauma in my past and also being in therapy/counselling. I’ve gone in to it with the mindset that the difficulty and frustration I experience is part of the meditation and that I should not feel bad if my mind wanders or I need to take a break as the act of realising that has taken place and forgiving myself has been part of the process. I started off with simple stuff like focussing on the breath, and have found it easier as time has gone on, but I still have days that are very tough, however taking the time to meditate, even for a short moment, is usually rewarding."

AskUK,epwfz7f,t3_bw8gqp,1559574869.0,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this right now. It sounds like we're currently in a similar situation with the NHS; I've also been trying to get help for the past 10-15 years and they are unable to provide the care that I currently need and the treatment that they can provide isn't suitable. I've actually had some success with them in the past but I'm finding more and more that the service is under-funded and the truth is that even the good doctor's that listen are unable to refer you to any suitable treatment as it just isn't available. Couple that with waiting lists and the possibility of getting prompt care, which is what it sounds like you need, just may not be available. I know that sucks but it seems to be the reality.

&#x200B;

You said that you feel you should be in hospital. I've been to an NHS psychiatric hospital before, it was never really clear or explained to me how I ended up there and it was only for a couple of days because I didn't want to be there and I was able to leave when I wanted because apparently I was self-admitted. That came about after going to A&E feeling suicidal but perhaps you can talk to someone about self-admittance before it gets to that point. That's also where I got my diagnosis in front of a panel of doctors.

&#x200B;

As others have said, it might be worth looking at alternatives to the NHS. That's actually been recommended to me by people working for the NHS. Private treatment can be expensive but there are charities that can help, and I've been in contact with clinics that offer treatment on a sliding-scale or offer low-cost treatment with trainees. You can also search online for counselling one-on-one in your area if you feel like you could benefit from it. In my experience I know that some are able to offer low cost treatment and some have told me that they can talk about these things over the phone so it might be worthwhile reaching out to some. It might be worth looking in to any free services that might offer CBT if that's what you're after. This all depends on where you're located though.

&#x200B;

Can I ask how you managed to get the social worker support? It's something that I think I could benefit from."
