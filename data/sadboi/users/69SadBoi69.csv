But I think this would still be an improvement over pure absentee ownership because they are actually forced to at least provide something of value to someone and this would quickly become expensive with multiple properties for a long time. I don't think any system can attain perfection but it seems superior.

The second point is increasingly obvious already. Corporate oligarchs are again controlling vast sectors and are vertically integrated while antitrust enforcement is basically nil, so the average worker is at their mercy. CVS for example in my field uses their financial power and vertical integration with PBMs and distributors and insurance to crush local competition and drive down worker wages and rights, and they are corrupting the schools and state pharmacy boards too.

Think of how much power the big tech companies and Amazon have over certain cities and workers. It isn't to the extent where the labor force is tied by law to the certain lords or lands, but it is rapidly approaching a point where just a handful of powerful corporate elites totally dominate the political landscape and the government legislative and regulatory apparatus is essentially captured by the owners of wealth."

Libertarian,fqsmw0c,t1_fqrvpiy,1589611937.0,"No, because I don't believe in libertarian theories of property rights. But to maintain internal consistency within the libertarian theory, since the vast majority of American property was not acquired justly from its original owner (that is, either stolen from the Native American tribes who originally occupied the territory, or produced via forced labor from slaves) the property rights must be declared illegitimate. Property rights are only legitimate if the object was acquired by homesteading / primitive accumulation or voluntary trade from a previous owner who themselves acquired it justly 

 This problem is raised in Nozick's book but an adequate solution is never posed. The problem can only be handwaved away by saying ""well that was a long time ago"".

Another ""solution"" is just total historical revisionism; that is, claiming all acquisition of territory and property from the Native Americans (not to mention the slaves) was actually voluntary. Say, by treaty or whatever. This is obviously false but some people do attempt this route. Note that arguing the Native Americans warred and stole from each other does not solve this problem, it only pushes it further back in time if one wants to maintain an internally consistent theory."

My current best personal theory about what drives support for Trump irrespective of race is adherence to Christianity, or at least the warped, conspiratorial Americanized Supply Side Jesus version of it. As dumb as Trump is as an individual, he has managed to tap in to a base in a way that GOP professional operatives could only dream of for years.

In hindsight, I think Bernie Sanders' hope for victory was premised on a sort of mirror image of that strategy on the left but he did not completely understand that the psychology of many leftists is not an exact obverse of the typical alt right supporter, since they are motivated by entirely different conceptions of how we should treat our in group and out groups. Since his campaign didn't work we will have to explore other options for obtaining breathing room while being crushed by the corporate state.
