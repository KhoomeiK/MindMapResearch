BPD,fkwulp0,t1_fkwoigc,1584606511.0,"I'm glad you're okay, now send me his address so I can knock his door and tell him how inappropriate and not okay yes behaved towards you!!"
BPD,fkwla9c,t3_fl1cb6,1584596071.0,"Dude that's awful behavior from your FP, I'm so sorry this is happening to you"
BPD,fjb7hm8,t1_fjai2yi,1583188023.0,"A lot of us are self aware enough to know all of this, but our mental illness and lack of support makes it incredibly difficult to put the theory into practice. I understand what you're saying in terms of having to work on it, but it's really not as straightforward as you're suggesting and it comes across as a lil insensitive to some."
BPD,fjafpz7,t1_fja4bzv,1583172563.0,"Wow well done you, I genuinely mean it. But just because this works for you my darling doesn't mean it works for all of us. Yes, we can maybe get an inclination that something is going to happen on occasion but this isn't always the case and it certainly isn't always controllable. Idk if it's just the bpd talking but this comment kind of gave me the vibes that you're insinuating we are to blame for our breakdowns and to just try stop having them. If it were that easy, we would all have done it by now."

BPD,f7iaaoa,t1_f7i8tqq,1573755897.0,"I just had a look at your profile and the things you say about your wife are disgusting. You should divorce her. She deserves someone better. Someone who will help care for her and not spread dangerous, inaccurate information about BPD"

BPD,erextg7,t1_erekbyn,1560795358.0,"I'm 25 and thought I was becoming too old to struggle with this, I worry that if I haven't got it by now I never will, so it's comforting that this is getting better for you at 40 and I'm so happy for you also!"
