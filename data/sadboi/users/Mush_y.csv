depression,facvy6v,t3_e00pxq,1575948355.0,"To be honest I don't know what to say or who to talk to. I just want to be alone. If normal is a feeling I don't know what it is. I went threw a divorce a year and a half ago. Time moves quick but my mind doesn't. I can't get past the feelings of missing my ex though I got married last month. I have been binge drinking for a long time now. I'm not sure how long anymore. I can't sleep if I don't drink. I can't handle being around people. I don't like going to stores, grocery shopping ECT. I don't trust anyone. Though this probably stems from much more than the divorce. It's been a rough deal for me. As it is with many people. I have no idea how to deal with life. I say I'm ok. I push through most days fine. But there is a part of me that's just tired. Tired all the time. A part that doesn't eat to deal anymore. It's fleeting. I watch people going through life seeming like there happy. I want that. Though I'm not sure what that would look like. My new wife has children. I'm not sure how to be a dad. If I'm not good for myself how am I supposed to try and raise children. I want the best for them. I can't even deal with my baggage. I put up a strong front but inside I'm torn up. Hell im not even sure what love is supposed to feel like. I can't even trust people. I don't even understand how the hell im married again. I have been completely honest with my wife about how I feel. Yet I can't bring myself to talk about my feelings most times. I don't know, I just wanted to share. Best regards."
