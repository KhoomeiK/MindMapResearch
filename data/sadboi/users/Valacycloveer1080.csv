benzorecovery,fqzmj9n,t1_fqza98m,1589770505.0,"You should have tapered the drug over a longer duration of time. I happened to run into the same issues. So i tapered mine by reducing the dose by 0.5 mg every 3 days. I wouldn't recommend you going back on xanax for a slow taper again as it is a slippery slope. However If those issues are unbearable you can take diazepam(5mg) for about 3 days. Then make it 2.5mg for 3 more days. Diazepam has a long half life hence is unlikely to produce dependence and is used in the withdrawal of both, benzos and alcohol to soothe the symptoms."

Indians have formed an image of themselves by doing stupid stuff. Whenever something is mentioned images of what is most relevant to it flash before people's minds. For example someone mentions Japan, their space age technology and anime flashes before you. Someone mentions russia, their communist image flash before you. Similarly when someone mentions India these things flash before people's mind and they spurt it out. This is because whatever good is about India is overshadowed by the people who ruin it's Image.

Firstly the sedation is so intense it knocks you out without even you realising it. I woke up a few hours later and had an uncomfortable respiratory depression. I had to put in work to breathe. Everytime i ignored breathing and went about my routine i could feel my lungs burning up a bit. So my point is be careful on this drug as i barely took it and all this happened.

And remember 2 important things; go slow and steady on the taper and once you start your journey don't ever go back to the current amount u are taking suddenly just because 1 day you feel like enjoying it again. The amount you are currently taking is a result of incremental tolerance. Once you taper the tolerance also decreases again and taking the same amount can be now fatal.

And btw the normal upper limit is 80.  90 is still ok, 120 is dangerous. So i had no choice but to taper off tramadol and now i am down to 2 pills per day. The withdrawal sucks and sometimes i have to make it 3. My point is if you dont  want cardiovascular isssues please do consider tapering off.
