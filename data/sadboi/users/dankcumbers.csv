BipolarReddit,fkjtjqj,t3_fivyfg,1584259020.0,Just know your not alone. That being said it‚Äôs amazing to just barely function and be depressed. Give yourself praise for the simplest things you do. I dissociate alot and its so depressing thinking about how i did nothing all day. I try to give myself praise for just getting out of bed each day.
BipolarReddit,fkjteze,t3_fisndn,1584258849.0,"Your not alone, depression keeps you from doing the most simple of tasks. I set not one but three reminders on my phone to get myself to do it."
BipolarReddit,fhyn5xd,t1_fhymz5i,1581979407.0,also i dont know if they have this where your from but there are friend hotlines where you can just chat with someone on the phone for company if your ever feeling isolated. Hang in there man üí™ ‚ù§Ô∏è
BipolarReddit,fhyj9mc,t3_f5eu46,1581977034.0,I know the saying is corny but this is what helped me when i was in a similar mind set to you. You can only go up once youve reached rock bottom. If your at the stage where you think nothing good will come of your life remember that you havent even experienced 25% of it yet. The good parts are on there way they‚Äôre just taking there sweet fucking time.
