I’m also a track and field coach, and although our season got canceled to COVID-19, I keep all my statistics, workouts, etc on the iPad. Once again the smaller size coming in handy for travel. 

Now that school is moving to an online format for the remainder of the year, I am actually going to use the iPad in my online classes for my students. I’m going to livestream my lessons, and I’m using the Notability app + airplay to screen cap it on my PC. This is the only time where I truly wished I had the bigger screen. 

TLDR- Lots of travel = smaller size, Keeping it at home = bigger size

Edit: I forgot to mention side car with the MacBook Pro. I use my iPad as a second display almost daily as all my work is done on the MacBook. Bigger screen would be nicer here."

In fact it’s the run I first learned how to ski on. After that there’s several runs that shoot off of it. Keystone is great for novices. 

Can’t really say much on price since I crash at a buddy’s place and have a pass. I think a day pass is around $135 and there is free parking, or you can park right next to the lift for 20 bucks a day. 

The landscape though is absolutely astonishing, some of the most breathtaking scenery in Colorado, especially as you first head down schoolmarm. 

This year I’ve gotten to Ski, Keystone, Vail, Park City, and Brighton and Keystone is my favorite by a mile.

The radar for a lot of maps wasn’t orientated the same way as the radar typically is orientated. The sponsorships on the walls of various maps always catch me off guard, and I think there’s a more professional way to go about that. 

The colors of the health bars were a nice touch, but not a lot of information was given overall on the hud, and it took me a while to figure out everything there. 

The central hud that showed the player info and webcam lacked vital details like ADR and HS%, while still taking up just as much if not more screen space as other big events.
