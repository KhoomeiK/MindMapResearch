I really agree that people shouldn't watch this film if their mental health is in a bad way, or if they've lost a sibling/child in a horrific accident. It was so disturbing, but I agree, brilliant.

I had a related experience, it's kind of fucked up though so **trigger warning**:

This wasn't a direct response to the movie, but I had a couple of weeks where I was experiencing extreme paranoia and insomnia (I have bipolar disorder and this was during a manic episode) I kept seeing dead animals everywhere, it reminded me of Hereditary. Like I just felt like I could see dead animal bodies and flesh everywhere I looked, I couldn't tell if they were hallucinations. I remember I was in the passengers seat of my dads car, we were driving on the highway and I saw a crow swoop down onto the road to eat the flesh of another dead bird and it really disturbed me. And because I wasn't in my right mind I kept panicking ""that was my fault, I did that!"" and had the same reaction to other roadkill we passed. I couldn't shake the feeling that I did something that set off this chain reaction and now I was being punished for it by having to witness all these animals die in horrific ways. When I could sleep I had dreams where animals were being decapitated and I felt like I was doing it somehow, even though I was desperately trying to make it stop. Then I found a dead possum my cat had killed in my backyard and it's head was severed (cats do that shit so it's not that unusual, but needless to say it fucked me up). It was a bad time, lol.

Anyway, all was fine after a couple weeks and I got over it. Made me cautious about when I watch horror movies in relation to when I can feel a bipolar episode coming on, unfortunately I have to be careful about it."
