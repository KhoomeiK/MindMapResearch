BPD,f75icy6,t1_f758cdk,1573415475.0,"I put my first referral in back in may, and it took them until August to call me, and then until September for me to actually get an over the phone conversation, and then they never called back. I’m now literally less than 2 weeks away from being 18 so I can’t do anything with them despite trying to contact them so long ago. An absolute joke it is, and they wonder why there’s so many teen suicides? All I’ve got now is waiting for my local 18-30 group therapy I don’t even want to go to. They’ve left me completely stranded with nothing despite knowing my situation. But hopefully it’ll work out and I’ll get it sorted if I get the courage lol. Thank you again <3"
BPD,f7575mp,t1_f7562qf,1573412409.0,"Thank you so much, I don’t think you understand how nice it is to know I’m not alone in the weird middle stage between child and adult and not knowing where I can turn. I’m not old enough and I’m not young enough so I’m stuck without much help. I’m hoping to go to the GP as soon as I’m 18 to talk to them and see what exactly they can do to me, and explain the process of what will happen in the following months. Seriously, thank you. I hope everything goes well for you and you get the help you need and get through university smoothly. <3"

As someone else said, I can just contact my GP and say I’m having mental health issues, then they can refer me to a psychologist"

BPD,f7476xm,t1_f73yhp1,1573398995.0,"That’s exactly why I’m trying to get a diagnosis, so I can explain to people what exactly is wrong with me in 3 simple words. They can then decide if they want to research and find ways in which they help. If they don’t? Not really sure if they’re worth my time then. A diagnosis can just be helpful internally to know you aren’t just wrong; there’s something genuinely wrong with you that has a name and you aren’t alone."

I’ve talked in depth about what’s going on and possible causes; it’s just all so complicated and jumbled that I don’t know what caused what; it’s just everything that’s happened that’s contributed.

But I had to end it because i felt sick and couldn’t lie to him like that, and ever since he’s hated me and calls me a bitch and what not. Despite the fact he hurt me that bad for his own selfish reasons.

My most recent ex called me manipulative for opening up to him, and I’ve had extreme trust issues ever since. He told me he was scared of what I would do to him and if I’d hurt and manipulate him too. 

I haven’t recovered from either and I have to go therapy for it. (Basically: men suck)"

SuicideWatch,f1gurih,t1_f1fs1zp,1569478068.0,"Bpd is way more than mood swings, a few other symptoms are unstable relationships, explosive anger, chronic emptiness, impulsivity, and a few more.

UpliftingNews,ezegvus,t1_eze6ixn,1567863746.0,"It’s perfectly fine to not be open about the labels, and keep it just as an option for your sex life!

You do you, use the labels you’re comfortable with and you should be good to go, good luck!"
UpliftingNews,eze42fy,t1_eze0sm4,1567858805.0,"Yes! You’d be considered heteroromantic (romantically attracted to the opposite sex) bisexual (sexually attracted to both), my ex used to be the same and it’s 100% valid. You can have sex with the same sex and not want to be romantically involved."

I’m very much of an open lover and I really love hugs and holding hands and saying ‘I love you!’ Even if we’re just friends, but a lot of my friends are uncomfortable with this so every time I advance to show that love, they shy away and don’t reciprocate.. it Sucks big time, and it ends up with me feeling dejected, clingy and creepy. You just gotta remember people love in their own way, and if it’s not so open, it doesn’t mean they don’t love you. It’s hard at times to accept that reality, but even just asking if they still care about you/want to be friends can go a long way in self reassurance and calming the big bpd anxiety"

I hold my same key values but I hide them depending on who shares them and who don’t (andddd when the key values I’m passionate about slip out around people who don’t agree, and they argue with me about it, I get a tad defensive and it’s usually my #1 cause in friendship fallouts, ouch)"
