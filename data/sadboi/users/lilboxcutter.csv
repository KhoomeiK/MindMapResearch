Deathcore,fqwfebk,t3_gl5tlf,1589702461.0,"i actually thought about that a lot, because i've been listening to aggressive, heavy and dark music ever since i discovered it... i'm generally pretty open when it comes to music and can appreciate all different kinds of it (i also listen to billie eilish, lady gaga or ariana grande once in a while) but since i discovered heavier music, i've always listened more to that than anything else... 
it all started with dubstep, one day i discovered deathstep (heaviest shit ever for me at the time) and also listened to all that's maybe more sad / melancholic than heavy, but always rather that than happy / optimistic music (also listened to PVRIS and $uicideboy$ quite a lot)
... and then one day my roommate showed me some of the Sempiternal / There Is a Heaven... era BMTH, i got into suicide season myself (one of my favorite metalcore albums to this day) and then gradually got into more and more heavy / aggressive shit - metalcore, deathcore, death metal, black metal, grindcore, you name it - which opened up a whole new world for me. like, dubstep can be pretty heavy, especially some deathstep stuff is really bleak and disgusting too, but deathcore is just something else... 

at the end of the day i just personally prefer that kind of music over most other popular music, because it just feels right to me - i don't listen to it to be edgy (i can't even really talk to anyone about it, because no one i know listens to music like that) but because i like it - hell i can even really relax to deathcore and sit down and close my eyes and let my pulse drops to the bottom while some dude screams his guts out, guitars get the shit distorted out of them and my eardrums are penetrated by a thunderstorm of drums... just sounds beautiful to me 




TL;DR: can't explain why but i like heavy music, been listening to more and more aggressive stuff over the years and have found myself in deathcore - and the dark atmospheres do resonate with me a lot actually (one of my favs right now is A Pale Procession by Black Tongue)"

I personally have dealt with all the phases and whatnot myself, just because I sometimes just mentioned something very vague and already saw my mom denying the direction I was going in, so I just kept everything to myself - I know not everybody can do that, but I've been doing good with that, some people just don't want to be bothered with other people problems and nobody can really look into your head, so you're most of the time the only person who really understands how you feel 

maybe you can get a diary or a folder with a lock or something or ""hide"" it 

honestly about the picture, maybe let your mom hang it somewhere... it kind of depicts exactly the problem - your actual feelings vs. what your parents see / want to see, so maybe someday someone will go into your house and look at it for a while and realize what it means, if that makes sense

... have you tried telling them how you really feel and that you feel like they just don't take you serious? 

also if they don't appreciate your art, just don't show them, they can't stop you from doing it 

P.S.: you're really good at what you do, the longer I look at the picture the more I like it, and I personally don't even think it's ""too sad"" in any way, I don't know, just looks like really good art to me - and I also feel like I can only really express how I feel through art sometimes, it just comes more naturally"

... I make music (digitally) and most of it is rather melancholic / dark, sad and / or aggressive sounding and I don't really let people listen much since I barely know anyone that's into that style of music anyways 

but at the end of the day, as much as I wanna share my music and want others to like it, I am making its forms myself, I make the art for myself and put a little big of my soul into everything and nobody else really has the right judge it, because it is MY art

... however it's actually more the idea and what that stands for that they are against than the actual concept of god (since they have one themselves)"
TooAfraidToAsk,fp5f58n,t3_gazx4k,1588327072.0,"god in the context of religion (for example christianity) can be, but only as a whole set of believes someone ""teaches"" you if you follow it 

... ""god"" itself however is more an idea and is whatever you want it to be. 
christianity and islam for example only have one God, greek mythology and hinduism have multiple gods...
and in buddhism (as far as I understand it) you yourself are more or less the ""god"" because they generally believe there is no higher being above us, but a divine being within you, that has to be discovered so you can become it, become a buddha (buddha is just a term for someone who has transcended his ""human form"" and become a higher being so to speak, so THE buddha [-> siddartha gotama] is just the most known person who has done that / become that)


... but generally, like i said, i think god is everything you want it to be. if you don't believe in a higher existence it can also just be you own moral compass, your set of believe, what you live for and by - the reason you don't go out of your way and commit crimes, hurt other people or go out of your way to disturb common principles of the society you live in 
so if you're only not stealing because you don't want to get caught and got to jail, the law and justice system is part of your ""god"" and that is also what people mean if they say ""only god can judge me"" -> there is this higher set of believes that i am putting all my faith in and living after and that matters more to me than (for example) the justice system / the police 

it's often just a question of how you define it and how you understand the word ""god"", and when i understand it the way i just described and you say something like ""there is no god / god is dead"" that would probably be very concerning if i really think you are thinking about god the same way i do, because that would mean you literally do anything you want because you don't have that said set of believes and inner moral guidelines and understanding of how to behave in society - that means you might kill me, because there is ""no one"" or ""no thing"" telling you / making you believe that is wrong 

... but most people are more referring to another idea of god when they say that, to state ""this idea / concept of god is not something i like, belive in or want to support for any number of reasons, so i denounce it""."

... whether it's just a thought that crosses your mind or you hold on to it and eventually tell someone always depends on the person and the situation, but it happens to everyone, which makes it really hard to not have issues like that in communities like that

I think the best startingpoint could be finding out were that comes from... like any kink or preference like that has it's root deep down in your brain and was probably caused by something you experience as child or later. so either try and do some digging yourself or maybe consult a therapist about this und let them help you 
... once you know were it comes from you can maybe start working on it and maybe resolve it one day"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fnzy9mz,t1_fnylt7j,1587402837.0,"that's what I was wondering... today I kind of accidentally had a rubber band on my wrist and ended up snapping it a few times out of curiosity and then a few more times 'cause it wasn't that bad... now a good 3-4 hours later I can still see some of the snaps, so I was basically wondering about what you just described 
... thanks for sharing"
