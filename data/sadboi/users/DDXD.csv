relationships,f7wbjez,t1_f7tlyee,1574031665.0,"This is almost certainly the correct answer, yet it will be one that is hard to accept. People who are cheating but in a committed relationship experience extreme cognitive dissonance. This is a literal painful mental state and they must do justification cartwheels in order to rectify it. 

OP, even if you don't think this is the case, you must snoop to find out first. Cheating is cancer to a relationship and nothing you do will help if this is happening."

insaneparents,f6a1nyj,t3_dqqh09,1572750757.0,"When I was 12, my dad told me to clean up my room before I went to a friends for the weekend. I admittedly did a crap job (things stuffed in closet/under bed). So he decided this was reason enough to throw out damn near everything that was mine. Toys, clothes, pictures of friends. I was absolutely traumatized to the point that my heart still beats faster when I think about it now more than 20 years later. He told me I didn't deserve any of my stuff.

This same guy spent so much money on phone sex lines and who knows what else that I wasn't allowed to get new clothes. I spent an entire year in school with only the same two outfits that I had  almost outgrown.  As a parent now, I can't even begin to imagine doing stuff like this to my kids."
modernwarfare,f68j2za,t1_f687ssz,1572729002.0,"This is the correct answer. And while I favor a ping based system without taking in to account skill, it would be pretty awful for the bottom 10% of players who would be having their shit pushed in every game."
AskReddit,f5bvuok,t1_f5a1mpl,1572126510.0,"This is close to what I do every time. Since I got on a new med, I lucid dream almost every night. It usually starts as a nightmare until I realize I'm in a dream. Then I wreck havoc on the dream world. Sometimes I fly around like superman, sometimes I make my enemies bend to my will, and sometimes I make hot chicks want me. I'll just blast away entire parts of the dream world and just generally be a god of my own universe. 

I'm sort of wondering if this is my brain's defense mechanism against the constant nightmares (I have PTSD and bipolar among other things)."
bipolar,f3wmmrj,t3_dikayz,1571209296.0,"It just past midnight here.  I love this time alone.  I mean, I'm alone all the time anyway, it is just a comfortable alone in the dark of the night.  No one expects anything, and the problems of tomorrow are delayed until after I sleep.  I can enjoy a good book, video game, TV show, or just wallow in my misery.  No judgement, and no one to disappoint.  I love the dark."
bipolar,f3wlpy6,t1_f3wl7re,1571208003.0,"You are 100% correct, and I did not mean to make light of the dangers of mania for anyone reading.  I was just curious about people who attempted to use it for the things they wanted to accomplish.  

I'm 37 and have learned to channel the manic energy in to productive things, but I spent at least half of my life just destroying my relationships and future.  While depression may not = bad, I don't advance anything in my life during that period.

Unfortunately, I have burned through antidepressants with shit doctors, and I doubt it is a good idea to go with cocaine.  I won't lie that I need to perform at work soon and I need superman to show up =("

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,f322o3x,t3_dfaptz,1570591620.0,"I'm on the other end of this as a regular corporate traveler, and I would say the irregular policies around water make this a pain in the ass. I'm a regular runner and drink a lot of water. And sorry I dont like the piss tasting tap in some cities.

If the hotel has a little shop, no problem, I buy a bunch of water and I'm happy. However, a lot of hotels only have ""free"" water. Many times I have no rental car and have to rely on the hotel for water. Typically they will give me free extra ones, but when I tell them I actually need more (4 vs 2 or whatever), but that I'm happy to make my company pay for them, I almost always get dirty looks or eye rolls. I guess because they can't really sell it but think I'm a jackass for asking for more. 

I always stay at the same super chain, I have the top level status, and I have yet to find the same policies as I travel around. It makes it hard to plan, etc. That being said, sounds like this guy was a rude ass for no reason."

Kudos to the OP for having big balls though and being adult about her reaction."

pics,ewdcgl7,t1_ewd2op3,1565298534.0,"The shit part is that these people being rounded up are just working, and not the drug runners or hard criminals that are railed against. I used to work in a business side by side with undocumented workers and they were, for the most part, just hard working sons of bitches who were sacrificing everything to just take care of their families. It really helps to humanize and feel empathy, as opposed to thinking about them as some group of criminals."

depression,evqcte9,t3_ckmvf8,1564690763.0,"Absolutely. Though it was more of a problem with my psychiatrist than my therapist as they are trying to prescribe meds based off my condition. I started keeping a daily spreadsheet with how much I slept, my rating for depression and anxiety, symptoms and comments for each day. That way I could recount and answer without guessing so much. It has been very helpful and I just print it out to bring to each appointment."
depression,eunu5jb,t3_cgqll1,1563933557.0,"I think a big problem, especially on this sub, is that there are 2 types of depression people refer to. One is a mental illness and the other is circumstance driven depression.  Or a mix of the two. 

If you are depressed because your dog died, your girl left you, you are jobless or your life just plain sucks...well you have a good reason to feel bad.  It doesnt make it feel any less worse, and people with some depression as a mental illness will deal with this far worse than someone who doesn't. But that is probably the primary source of ""depression"" I see on this sub. The nice thing about that type is that your circumstances are very likely to change at some point if you just hang in there. This is especially true if you are young (under 25). 

However, if your life circumstances give you no true reason to feel bad (with all of the other symptoms that come with it), but you do anyway, that is the hallmark of mental illness. I am 37, been depressed (+5 other diagnoses) since I was at least 16. I have attempted suicide twice and am currently on 8 different medications plus supplements. I have no reason to feel bad. I have a beautiful wife, 2 wonderful kids, a job where I make 100k+ and a reasonable set of skills. Yet I want to die most of the time.

So if the circumstances of your life are troubling you, you can definitely fight your way out if you are willing.  There is a lot of luck involved but time will very likely give you a chance if you are willing to take it.  Good luck brother."
depression,euihxmr,t1_euih8ew,1563848148.0,"I understand, that's the core of depression as a mental illness unfortunately. I'm 37 and been dealing with it on and off my whole life. Sometimes it is a daily battle just to get out of bed and no one understand the pain. 

I don't fault you for wanting out. The pain is unimaginable sometimes. All days are bad days and bad days are horrific, right? My only comment is that I have also had happy days and have a family to care for now, you may have more to live for in the coming years than you realize. Don't let your parents force you in to making that decision. Make it for yourself when you have made some more progress through life.

I hope things get better for you brother, I really do. Some of us out here understand the pain and really do care. Hang in there."
depression,euicplp,t3_cghcle,1563845014.0,"Just a heads up, that likely wouldn't have killed you, but made for a terribly painful hospital visit and restriction of freedom. I tried something similar and have since researched and learned more about just how resilient the human body is. 

Don't make such a decision on a single event though. Ultimately, your own life is your freedom to carry on or take as you please. But at the very young age you are, there is still a great chance to turn things around. Keep fighting for a bit and see what happens. You still have your ultimate freedom if needed, so why not carry on and fight for now. 

Hope you feel better bro."
