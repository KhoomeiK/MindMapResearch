anxietysuccess,ewinz6k,t1_ewiinny,1565453305.0,"I linked it because your anxiety is mostly based on 'other people's reaction' rather than What's actually happening to you and how you feel... You're more bothered about what people think

You need to mentally direct your thinking in a positive manner, for example:

- people are understanding and caring, and if they see someone throw up, they'll feel sympathy and not discusted 

- these people you will never see again in your life and it's a quick journey 

- similarly, tell yourself; if I was sat at home this very moment, I wouldn't feel sick, because my body isn't sick, it's just my mind being stupid! And I won't let my mind take over me! 



1) What's your daily/life routines like? Do you spend time on yourself? 
2) Have you ever challenged yourself before? By choice, rather than due to lifestyle"

Yes never run away, you need to do a few things that you enjoy

Flying is very safe and being high is not an issue in a plane! You've done it before

My advice is don't let this be long, book a flight with friends you love and trust to a destination that'll blow your heart away.. Don't long it out

Also you need tell your Brain it's just the anxiety speaking and you're totally fine"

You can do it!   


You need to explain to your husband that the first time youre going to fly, you might want to spend a bit more money, just so you feel comfortable; even book first class if you have too!   


You also need to tell yourself, you're doing this for your kids and you want them to be happy and enjoy, and that once youre all on the plane; your kids will be so happy and so will you.  


You also need to start challenging your general anxiety to build confidence.. You can do it, happy to coach you more.
