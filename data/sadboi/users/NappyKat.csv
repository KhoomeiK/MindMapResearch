As someone else who feels like weed helps them not be so suicidal, I’m sure that weed isn’t the only thing you care about. In my opinion, if it was all you cared about, your reason to get it wouldn’t be to keep yourself non-suicidal. Personally, sometimes I feel like I don’t really get high, I just feel a bit more normal. I don’t really have much advice on what to do, just saying you’re not alone in how you feel. 

I’ve had some trouble getting ready this morning. I’ve yet to leave the house. I couldn’t figure out to wear and I was struggling about hiding my recent SH. I feel like I’m gonna be so fucking hot and look bizarre in a hoodie when it’s 75 F out. 

I also am familiar with feeling like my mom’s outlet for her daily frustrations. I feel like this reply is getting long lol like I’m starting to vent too ha

Which is my way of saying perhaps your hands don’t look as terrible as you think to another person when they see you. 

Also, I don’t know if this will help but... I was watching a Japanese TV show and they gave a tip to older women to make hands appear younger in photos. They said to raise your hands straight up for a few seconds (can’t remember, maybe 10?) and then take a photo. Maybe this trick will help you feel less self conscious at least in photos? Again, not sure if it’s helpful but thought to share.

Edit: a word"
