datingoverthirty,fqqpmw8,t1_fqpq56g,1589569691.0,"Hey, I agreed with this guy, though also with you that it doesn’t need to be a deal breaker.
You do However need to make sure she knows how you feel about this. The feel of “I’m not a priority“ is a huge issue in the long run if it isn’t dealt with.

(Sorry this turned into a rant. But here’s tiny snippets of my experience dating a woman who was too close to her family, was living with them when we met, and moving in with me was the first time she’s lived “on her own” post college roommates)

For some perspective, my most significant long term relationship ultimately didn’t work out because her family had too much control over her and she was “too close” to them even by 28 when we broke up. We were together for 5 years and basically married, owned a house together, had pets etc. I helped her sort out her life direction and supported her through grad school. But I never asked her to marry me because I knew if anything ever went wrong between her family and me, that she would choose them over me. Lo and behold shit did hit the fan after us being together for 5 years, her parents essentially treated me like shit for years, then surrounding some specific events their transgressions went so far that she decided to cut them off for the time being (cut them off meant only talking to her mom once a day on the phone rather than wake up to phone calls with mom and hanging out with mom every day).

She lasted a month before she cracked to their attempts to convince her to leave me, so we broke up. That was three years ago, we still don’t have the joint property 100% settled.

Oh, haha, also through the whole five years she only spent Christmas with my family once. My family lived 2500 miles away and so I’d only see them once or twice a year. Her whole family wouldn’t respect me trying to prioritize my own family when they would visit. Like one time my dad and I went on a weekend camping trip (see:two days). The problem was the ex and I had to move the next week. Her parents decided the two days I was gone was when the majority of the moving should happen, despite me saying we’ll just move it when I get back, there was plenty of time. They did it anyway while I was gone and I got permanently labeled as a lazy selfish piece of shit all because I wanted to spend some quality time with my dad who I hadn’t seen in at least a year on a trip that was planned for over 6 months, and they were unwilling to bend their schedule a tiny bit to accommodate mine.

The reason shit hit the fan later was actually then disrespecting my family too. I’m sugarcoating this, but her mom essentially said we shouldn’t have gone to my sister’s funeral because things we were doing there were more important. That was the brick that broke the camels back and I had no interest in ever being in the same room as them again after that.

In conclusion family/relationship dynamics with family are very important. Advice I’ve listened to and witnessed to be true: Remember, you’re marrying their family too.
My ex’s parents happened to be narcissistic sociopaths, and it took me too long to realize it. Your girl’s parents might be awesome people. But make sure they respect her autonomy and don’t treat her like a child. (Guilt trip her if she doesn’t go their way)"

Like everything else in the world it is not as black and white as “if someone is suicidal they’ll find a way”
That statement is anything but true.
There are levels to it and one of the main things to go out the window when depressed is willpower. It’s hard as f*** to do ANYTHING while severely depressed. And a gun is by far the easiest and most full proof way to kill.

Also it’s true that people about to commit suicide back out when there is some kind of barrier. If someone had easy access to a gun there would be nothing stopping them in their moment of weakness."

I always wanted to reject the idea that depressive episodes I had were “clinical”, caused by chemical imbalances, after all I’ve been through some shit. Every major depressive episode I felt could be connected to specific events, so I was circumstantially depressed.

But then I started to realize I was majorly depressed to the point it affect my daily function for close to 50% of the time over the past 4 years. And then during these depressive episodes I started to automatically respond to every hardship with the though, “oh, I might as well just kill myself” or something like that. I didn’t actually desire suicide, but I felt like trying to do any activity was pointless to the extent that I’d rather just not exist.

dating_advice,fplacbj,t3_gdxhf6,1588709162.0,"I’m going to be a little harsh on purpose, and requested.

Hey, so I read your post, and some of you comment replies over on dating over thirty. They locked the comments, so I’m responding here.

First off before I respond to specifics - you 100% have an eating disorder. Eating disorders are not about what you eat, it’s about how food affects the rest of your life, and food has complete control of you even if you think you’re wielding power over it with your health food and strict lifestyle. You need to take what everyone said seriously and go to therapy.
Secondly, if you truly are saving a ton of money, then go buy some great dental insurance and get some more work done on your teeth/mouth. Eating meat in general should not cause pain (you don’t need to eat meat, just sayin it shouldn’t be painful).

About your living situation and lifestyle (which is a product of your eating disorder).
So your goal is to date..
The only things that you mentioned that would be a major hinderance to intimacy are the lack of furniture, your work schedule, and possibly the no air conditioning (if you ever want to life with someone).

Furniture - go buy at LEAST at couch or a table+chairs. No woman I ever met would consider seriously dating a man who they found out had no furniture, let alone no bed in their place. It’s a huge red flag. People will assume you’re either poor, a child who can’t take care of themselves, or inconsiderate to a guest’s comfort (which would translate to being inconsiderate toward a potential partner). In your case the issue is mental illness, so the red flag is valid.
So if you ever want to date a woman who isn’t a drug addict that’s ok with your place looking like a crack den, then buy some furniture.

Now to the bed. I’m pretty sure sleeping on a good mattress is better for you than sleeping on the floor. Think of it as the next step of your self flagellation - practicing being strong in the face of comfort. After all, if you need all this discomfort lifestyle, isn’t that a sign of weakness? Your goal is strength right? Why can’t you let yourself be comfortable? Because you think you’ll spiral out of control? This is all caused by your eating disorder controlling your life. You aren’t the one in control, even if you feel like you are with all the strictness.
Think about this: a good relationship is wonderful and will bring you a kind of joy you haven’t experienced yet. If you have no practice controlling yourself with simply being comfortable, how hard will you spiral out of control if you experience actual joy? It sounds to me like you’ll completely lose yourself in your partner/relationship. And that is bad, very very bad. Both for yourself/mental health, and for your attractiveness to a partner.

Trust me, if you have a good mattress it’ll make a world of difference with your sleep and you’ll see yourself improve. You’ll probably even see improvements with your fitness goals and recovery time. I recommend the brand called “purple”. You don’t absolutely need a bed frame, but I’d recommend it, so it’ll be more difficult for bugs/spiders to crawl up into the bed, and easier to keep the sheets cleaner.

Now your work - you said you work in a restaurant, is this true? Are you happy with your job, is this what you want to do the rest of your life? If it is, then cool, you’re way ahead of the rest of us. If not, consider using some of that money your saving to start taking class that seem interesting to you to try and explore and find out what you might want to do for work.

If you don’t like your job, and let it control your schedule that much, and you aren’t looking for ways to change this, that’s not going to be an attractive thing for a potential relationship partner.
But again if you love your job or want to work your way up in the industry, then great. But try to gain a little more autonomy.
You aren’t going to be able to find a date with those hours of availability, unless it’s with another restaurant/bar industry person.

Summary:
1. Go to therapy, be open to the idea that you might have an eating disorder. Mental health should be your #1 priority, and it seems like it is since you’ve taken such drastic measures already.
2. Fix your teeth.
3. Buy a mattress. A good one. A shitty one will be worse than your floor. (Purple mattress has been the best I’ve had and they’re reasonably priced).
4. Buy some furniture.
5. Consider your work and how it affects your life and goals.
Bonus: consider finding another hobby outside of personal fitness/health. You could incorporate it though, like rock climbing, spin class, kickboxing. Doing an activity that involves a community will greatly increase your mental health AND your potential for finding a partner. But I do recommend finding a non fitness hobby too, it’ll make you a more interesting person to interact with.

Everything else on your list is actually potentially a positive for dating.
Saves money, works out, has a job, knows how to cook.
TV is trash - don’t buy one (if you do, just get Netflix or another streaming service, cable TV is garbage because of commercials.

Good luck. And again, go to therapy and stick with it even if it seems like nothing is happening for a while."

Trying to navigate dating people from my “real” life is way too complicated and not worth the hassle unless it’s 99% obvious the woman is into me. And that has nothing to do with the fear of rejection.
It’s the threat of being viewed as a creep.

There have been plenty of women I’ve met that I was into, but I didn’t show “Romantic” interest because in my personal experience it’s almost impossible to tell what the other person is feeling toward me and I’d rather just not even bother if it’s not obvious.
I’ve also had a couple formative experiences (see, before I ever had an actual relationship) of women coming on to me then a couple days later accusing me of coming on to them as a negative. That fucked with my head a bit and made me very cautious with who I ever try to pursue."

But if that’s the case, how the fuck am I (and many others) ever going to find another partner... I’m completely done with online dating, and I’ve never been into bars/clubs, and no one ever wants to be approached randomly by a stranger, so the only other option for dating is meeting someone with similar interests through work/school, get togethers, or mutual friends. And When meeting people in these contexts I’m not immediately trying to date anyone so we’d naturally talk and become friends if we get along. I believe feelings can develop over time.

When they had to leave with their school group I gave the original little boy one of my pens because I could tell he was legitimately interested, where as most of the other kids were just grabbers on who wanted in on an activity/didn’t want to be left out.

About ten minutes after they left an older woman approaches me and asks if I gave a pen to one of her kids. I was terrified. I thought I was about to have to deal with a super annoying confrontation and be chewed out and accused of being a creep. But when I said yes, she sighed with relief and all her tension released. She thanked me sincerely and said something along the lines of that action will mean more than I can know to that little boy in particular. I’m pretty sure she was worried he stole the pen from me.



I (adult male) used to work with kids through after school programs, camps, and occasional babysitting. I did this from about 15-21 years old.

Some people (my boss, some parents, and all the kids) were very encouraging and happy I was there because so few men were ever doing those kinds of jobs in our area and they really liked the idea of the kids getting a positive male influence.

He also told us “funny” stories about how he would “prank” his “friends” by doing things like smearing his one feces on their car windshield, and he once changed all the locks on his buddies house while he was supposed to be house sitting for the guy (supposedly because he didn’t like how the guy treated his girlfriend). Annnd he would always hug our female coworker/friend a bit too long and a bit too firmly if you know what I mean.

Over the year the guy essentially got ostracized by everyone at the office. At the end during a work party he confronted me about ghosting him while drunk and asked if I disliked him/wanted nothing to do with him. I said it’s not like that, and wanted to try and softly explain that he was too abrasive but I didn’t have the courage to continue the confrontation and and he was too drunk to listen.
I wish at that time I was able to just tell him straight up he was a dick, creepy toward women, and I didn’t like how he treated me.

Last I heard he’s a line cook. He’d be they type of,person to spit in people’s food because it’s “funny”"

DeepIntoYouTube,fo1mph9,t3_g56t3n,1587436674.0,"Anyone remember this guy? I found him back in 2007. He would upload very strange monologues while slightly drunk telling anecdotes about his life. They would often involve him singing, and many of them were video responses to other content creators stuff (back when YouTube content creators were mostly just vloggers).
Me and a buddy would sit for a couple hours straight watching a ton of this guys stuff.

Earlier this year I decided to watch some of his stuff while high, and I can say it still holds up 100%. In celebration of 420, I decided to share him here since I think his content fits in perfectly with this sub. I hope a few of you are baked out of you mind, click this and decide to watch some of his stuff.

I recommend the video “Press Charges” for anyone else who grew up playing video games as well.

**SPOILER**
Over time, being fascinated with him I learned he’s essentially a performance artist. So it’s unclear if the life stories are improvised or written or true. I think it’s a mix of all three, and it doesn’t really matter anyway."
AskReddit,fo0qa04,t1_fo0co6d,1587417778.0,"I think all the street fighter type things you’re referring to were driven by the arcade industry and porting from arcade to home console. I think it was because the technology wasn’t near where it is today and something like DLC wasn’t possible, they literally had to release a new game. And the new versions were first Arcade cabinets. Excluding the Arcade versions there weren’t that many Street Fighter games on home console (4 total over the decade) and you’ll notice they coincide with a new console port/edition:

Here’s a list with the mainline console and the street fighter games (numbered) with year of release.

Commodore 64
	(1) Street Fighter 1988
	(2) Street Fighter 2 1992

NES
	(2) Street Fighter 2 1992

	(3) Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition 1993

AskReddit,fo0b7nf,t1_fo07wa3,1587409528.0,"Back in the day there was an understanding that DLC was stuff that couldn’t be completed within the initial development timeframe. It was in good faith that the developers were working their hardest to create something as best they could before the game’s release. Then once it was released, if they wanted to add more features to the game they would continue working and the consumer would be able to pay to buy this new content if they wanted to. The game experience was supposed to be “complete” upon initial release. DLC was just extra, out of love.

If a developer was using resources to create content that was not included in the initial release, during the initial development period before initial release, it was considered a pretty dick move/taking advantage of the consumer/not fair to the game’s quality.

Basically a company making something to purposefully sell later while releasing an “incomplete” product was shady and money hungry.


It’s basically an argument of love vs money. It may seem a little silly, you could argue shouldn’t the developers get paid for the work they do beyond the games initial release?
Yes they should, but somehow in the past they were able to be paid “enough” while still releasing DLC content for free. It seems that greedy publishers started forcing developers to create more and more and more, and charging for it. This coincided with the proliferation of free to play (aka pay to play) mobile games.

I think it’s started to balance out a bit better in recent times but like 7-10 years ago there was an uproar over “abusive” DLC practices.

I’d like to blame all the bad parts on greedy investors/publishers that have no real connection to gamers and are out of touch who control what the actual game developers are able to do."

AskReddit,fnztvto,t1_fnzgs1w,1587400672.0,"A friend of mine got basically the same job except moderating Xbox live. Seems like they have slightly better work environment than the Facebook teams, and it was a very small team in comparison. I’m not sure if they had access to therapy.

The situation with a lot of QA Microsoft jobs as of 5/6 years ago was that they used contracting companies (think temp agencies) to hire and pay these employees, but they would work directly with Microsoft on the Microsoft campus, being supervised by full time Microsoft employees. They’re essentially working for Microsoft just being paid by a third party and not getting benefits or job security.

My friend was able to work his way up through technical ability and get a better job on a game development team.

Last I heard the QA work situation there is slightly better now (If you are a medium level employee). Don’t quote me on this, but from what I’ve heard in the game testing world, Microsoft and their contracting companies now have medium level QA employees working more directly with Full Time Employees, as STEs (test engineers), and the masses of TAs (test associates) are offsite at their own facilities, never directly working with Microsoft employees face to face. This is much worse for the low level TAs, but a bit better for the STEs.
In other words, if you live in the greater Seattle and have no software testing experience but want to break in to the industry through game testing at Microsoft, now might not be the best moment because you’ll be even more isolated from the devs than in the past. But if you already have a year or two of experience then it might be a good time to apply for STE positions."

She explained to us that in in Russia it’s considered a good thing to be able to cheat and get away with it - it’s considered skillful. If you get caught you get in trouble, same as in the US, but it’s almost expected that everyone will cheat in order to as well as possible."

Personally, even without all the other stuff you listed, his refusal to say you’re in a relationship on social media would be enough of a deal breaker for me to end a relationship.
I’ve been in relationships in the past where the other party refused to acknowledge the relationship online and 100% it means they want to hide the fact they’re dating you. Whether it’s because they want to have the freedom to cheat, they’re embarrassed by you for some reason, or some bullshit about their mom. It still means they want to hide the fact they’re with you, and to me that’s borderline emotional abuse, heavy manipulation, and gaslighting.
I could go on. Essentially I don’t believe there is any healthy reason someone would want to hide the fact they’re dating someone. It’s a huge pet peeve of mine in relationships. It doesn’t matter at all if you go “Facebook Official” or post about one another on social media - I actually prefer to keep my business rather private - but in the context you present and that I’ve experienced, if one partner requests acknowledgment and the other refuses, it’s not a good sign."
