Anxiety,f9nouv6,t1_f9nmtig,1575488206.0,"Logically, I know that these minor situations I worry about most likely won‚Äôt matter in the long run, but it‚Äôs just so hard not to feel overwhelmed.

I‚Äôve been seeing the same therapist for several years and she‚Äôs wonderful. She really helps me keep my thoughts in check, suggesting what is rational and what is not, etc. Therapy has certainly helped me, though it may not be the same for everyone. I‚Äôve also tried so many different medications for both depression and anxiety, and right now I‚Äôm currently on four different prescription medications. They certainly have taken the edge off the anxiety, but of course it‚Äôs not a cure by any stretch of the imagination. I still feel on edge a lot of times, and I know that if something super stressful were to happen, like getting fired or losing a family member, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to function.

With all that said, I still try my best to stay positive and to check certain thoughts as they come up. My life is definitely better than what it was, say, 5 years ago, but I still have a long way to go. My current stressor is not knowing what to do with my life, but I know it will just take some time to figure it out. I think that my anxiety will continue to improve over the years, little by little, though there will always be certain situations that will continue to be very stressful."
NobodyAsked,f9nhumn,t3_e5yeeu,1575484785.0,I wouldn‚Äôt let a man with a beard touch me anyway
Anxiety,f9nhns9,t3_e5jsbv,1575484687.0,I know what you mean.
Anxiety,f9nh875,t3_e62j78,1575484455.0,"For me personally, anxiety is constantly being on edge in uncomfortable or unfamiliar situations, but also in some familiar situations, like work. I‚Äôve worked at the same place for 8 months now, and every so often my heart will start racing because I‚Äôm just so nervous about making a mistake. And if/when I do make a mistake, it turns into internally berating myself because I should have known better, and dreading other people‚Äôs reactions, even though I know everyone I work with is pretty understanding. 

I can see where your girlfriend is coming from when she overanalyzes even the smallest of situations. For me, anxiety makes decision-making very difficult. I have to know all the ins and outs of a situation, all the things that could possibly go wrong, how to handle it if something does go wrong, etc. I have to weigh my options very carefully like this because I‚Äôm terrified of making a mistake, especially with something important or semi-important. I feel like I let people down when I make a mistake (which may or may not be true), and I hate that feeling, so I try to do everything I can to avoid it. If I don‚Äôt weigh all possibilities in this way and something does go wrong, I will feel extremely disappointed in myself for not ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù for that situation, even if there‚Äôs not much I could have done to prevent it. This overanalyzing is why I take very few risks, even if it meant bettering myself or having a great time. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.

In regards to your girlfriend, offer reassurance in a situation stressful to her. Help her work through her anxious thoughts, if you feel comfortable doing that. Although reassurance will not ease every ounce of anxiety, it is comforting to know that someone does care and is trying to understand."
