cincinnati,fqu2ioi,t1_fqs5duc,1589650768.0,I had a friend who lived 2 floors up from Gala. I spent the night maybe twice and it was AWFUL. One of the nights they had a special DJ and it was BUMPIN until close. Her couch was vibrating. It was insane. She moved in there before it was Gala but eventually moved bc she couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore.
awakened,fqnds05,t1_fqncefl,1589493054.0,Definitely trying to do my best! üôåüèº thank you for the reminder!
MediumReadings,fpdhri4,t3_gcrbkm,1588527235.0,Chatted you!
Empaths,fpb42q3,t3_gcfbsv,1588461676.0,I also wanted to add that this community has been so so helpful during this time. I truly appreciate each and every one of you. I wish I could know you all in person. But I guess our souls already know one another ‚ù§Ô∏è love you all
MediumReadings,fpazbk0,t3_gb7ze1,1588458846.0,I love you! I needed that love. Thank you
Showerthoughts,foka8by,t1_fojix1b,1587838295.0,"Sending you love and healing energy, my friend ‚ù§Ô∏è"
SelfDefense,fojer8x,t1_fo8536c,1587818782.0,"Thank you!!! I am a kickboxing instructor so I‚Äôve started there, I‚Äôm just looking to expand my knowledge while I can‚Äôt train in person (bc quarantine)."
SelfDefense,fojenvg,t1_foik4w7,1587818700.0,"And that‚Äôs why I understand it takes years of experience and practice lol. Again, not looking for a shortcut nor taking this lightly. I guess I should‚Äôve included all this in my original post. Kind of difficult to find in person training during a lockdown. So I wanted to expand my knowledge online while I had the time."
confidence,fofssor,t3_g79jl6,1587742190.0,"Yas, good job! I need to do this for myself. I have a friend who continues to do this but she‚Äôs going through some really extreme mental health issues. I‚Äôve told her multiple times that she says things that offends me but she doesn‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs always ‚Äújust joking‚Äù to her. 
I don‚Äôt know how to express how much it bothers me without being insensitive. She‚Äôs pretty unstable. It sucks a lot, she‚Äôs one of my best friends and I love her. But damn, she‚Äôs made me cry. At what point do I say I need my space if she‚Äôs going to continue to say the things she does? Example: talks shit about my career(which i love), one time laughed/questioned MY mental health issues (wtf). 
That‚Äôs awesome that you could do that and this gave me hope!"
SelfDefense,foainay,t3_g67l6r,1587647204.0,Thanks everyone for your recs/advice. I am already a kickboxing instructor. I have experience of martial arts and plan on continuing my training this way as well. I just wasn‚Äôt sure if there was some extra good training online that specializes in this. I wouldn‚Äôt just jump into teaching classes. I understand how much experience goes into being a self defense instructor. Definitely not looking for a shortcut. Just want as much knowledge as possible!
relationships,fo6i6oa,t3_g5xw7e,1587559433.0,"OP, you are a strong fucking person and don‚Äôt ever forget your worth. There is such thing as toxic family- it really sucks to accept it. But you are doing your best and deserve the best in life. It‚Äôs ok to create boundaries and/or cut out awful family members (even if they are your parent/s). 
My dad is a horrible person (now in prison) and so is his side of the family- I had to cut them out of my life when I was 18. So I feel you there. Wasn‚Äôt easy. But it‚Äôs so important to take care of yourself. No one deserves to be treated like this. 

 I can tell that you‚Äôre creating an amazing life for yourself and that‚Äôs the only thing you can do to keep that power. Proud of you. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. Sending you love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ptsd,fl9v0ic,t1_fl8i82y,1584970008.0,I second this. Please don‚Äôt take it personal! Therapists are healers and do their best to help us in any way that they can - but they also have to take care of themselves. Sometimes that means switching jobs.
Empaths,fl70b5x,t1_fl6wex4,1584890079.0,Same! Being an empath and also very sexual has been challenging though. I have found myself in not so great situations/had sexual experiences with meh people and felt their negative energy after we hooked up.
Dissociation,fkfmf7w,t1_fked9or,1584137659.0,A carnivore diet is likely causing your body to have some issues. Sometimes people have strange body experiences after eating a lot of meat / they just transitioned from being vegetarian. I would recommend talking to a nutritionist to see what diet plan would work best for you
ADHD,fkbx919,t1_fkbj50g,1584041632.0,I second this. My therapist is effing amazing
ptsd,fkb2wg9,t1_fkb0v1v,1584025022.0,"Please don‚Äôt give up. There are so many people are there who are there for you and care that you are here. This is the number for the national suicide hotline. Please call them if you are experiencing suicidal thoughts. 1-800-273-8255. 
Sending you love and healing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ptsd,fkb0e66,t3_fhh2sl,1584023516.0,"I wish I could hug you and tell you everything will be okay. Keep fighting. Don‚Äôt let him control your life now. I have to tell myself this everyday. We are capable of letting go of the pain associated with our dads. 
Keep your head up. Talk to someone. Call a therapist. Take a deep breath. You are amazing and you can do this."
Empaths,fk4o9on,t3_fgh4sd,1583864363.0,You are adorable. Thank you for this message today!!
ptsd,fk4nzk3,t1_fk4icxl,1583864203.0,Same. I quit my job because I was sexually harassed multiple times and my manager never did anything about it. I once had a customer (I was a server) scream across the restaurant ‚ÄúI wanna f*** you!‚Äù To me. My GM‚Äôs response: ‚Äúoh you know how guys can be idiots‚Äù. Still angers me to this day.
ptsd,fjvyhhb,t3_fez2f2,1583632333.0,"Sorry to hear this hun. Hugs from afar! 
My best advice, tell your boss. Tell your coworkers. Do not be ashamed of sharing your mental health needs. 
My employer / coworkers are aware of my anxiety/ ptsd. I recently had a panic attack at work. My coworker came to the rescue to cover my position while I calmed down with no issue and it was so so comforting. 
Do your research on what‚Äôs best for you. But CBD oil has been incredibly helpful for my anxiety /ptsd triggers."
relationships,fjbfwqo,t1_fjbf0ik,1583192387.0,I wouldn‚Äôt call it avoiding each other. We are really independent people and we just need to give each other some space to heal. Some people need to be alone to process what they are going through.
Anxietyhelp,fiqf3dk,t1_fip4jpm,1582642894.0,"They also do live sessions and phone calls if that‚Äôs preferred. I just like the extra text messaging option in case i need to get something off my chest/vent a little bit. 

I have no idea the general price of in person therapy. But I do know my insurance cost is $60 a session. Whereas I pay $60 for a whole week of talking with this lady. So in my opinion, it‚Äôs the better option there. 
Best of luck to you though. You‚Äôll find an awesome person who is helpful for you‚ù§Ô∏è 
you‚Äôll get through this, I promise"
Anxietyhelp,fip17bp,t3_f8vgqe,1582595724.0,I have an online therapist through BetterHelp. She‚Äôs been sooo helpful! I highly recommend looking on there. No insurance required!
ptsd,fi27vth,t3_f61jh4,1582073507.0,You‚Äôre exactly where you need to be in your journey. Look to the light that is coming into your life. Sending you love and peace as you heal ‚ù§Ô∏è
Empaths,ff30bkx,t3_er62f8,1579530230.0,You are an amazing human. Wish there were more people like us. I love people too. It hurts when I know someone is struggling and I can‚Äôt make them feel ok ‚ù§Ô∏è
Empaths,fdnf3tn,t3_em8o6k,1578584460.0,"Omg yes. I am a personal trainer at a box gym and so I don‚Äôt get to choose my clients. I have one who legit refuses to speak to me (we used to be cool, no idea what happened) but still chooses to train with me. It‚Äôs so weird. People are odd. This is twice a week for 30 mins."
Fitness,fdle87q,t1_fdl7uzu,1578522134.0,"My advice is just gradually get back into it! I dislocated a rib (so weird, i know) back in the fall and I am just now getting back to a normal gym routine. It‚Äôs probably your body telling you to slow down anyways. You‚Äôve got this though!! Gotta take care of yourself. Also continue going to chiropractor to make sure it stays away üëçüèº"
