relationship_advice,fr3qmky,t3_gmcyf6,1589863641.0,"Ed, if you suffer from BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), you likely crave intimacy like nearly all other adults. Yet, because you have a weak and unstable self image, you have virtually no personal boundaries to protect yourself during intimacy with a partner or with other loved ones. 

The result is that, during intimacy, you soon will start feeling like you are becoming enmeshed in your partner's strong personality. It will feel like you're losing your own self identity and being controlled or suffocated by your partner. You will have difficulty determining where YOUR feelings and problems stop and HERS begin. This is the ""engulfment fear"" you've heard about.

Unfortunately, once your partner has drawn close and become a loved one of yours, she cannot avoid triggering your two fears regardless of whether she draws near or moves farther away. This conundrum is due to the position of your two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means your partner often finds herself in a lose/lose situation because, as she backs away from one fear to avoid triggering it, she will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Her predicament is that the solution to calming your abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers your engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming your engulfment fear (moving back away to give yourself breathing space) is the very action that triggers your abandonment fear.

Hence, as your partner moves close to comfort you and assure you of her love, she eventually will start triggering your engulfment fear, making you feel like you're being suffocated and controlled by her. Yet, as she backs away to give you breathing space, she will find that she has started triggering your abandonment fear.

In my 15 years with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate his own emotions and tame his two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Hence, until you have had years of treatment in a program that teaches you the missing coping skills (e.g., DBT), you will often find yourself being hurt by your partner -- i.e., she will be triggering your engulfment fear as she draws near and triggering your abandonment fear as she draws back."
relationship_advice,fr3hb07,t3_gmg8wt,1589857411.0,"30M, your GF's abusive and controlling behaviors issues cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained. They may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER. Moreover, she would HATE being alone by herself.

Second, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

This B-W thinking also would manifest itself in the form of her seeing all your actions towards friends and family as a ""zero-sum game."" That is, she views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to her. 

Hence, she views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between her and other people. She is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier man, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie.

Third, you would not see her expressing her anger to total strangers (e.g., road rage against strangers). Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

Fourth, you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. Have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?"

Girl, if she is an untreated pwBPD, she is so unstable that you cannot know whether she has split you black permanently -- as she did with the guy who ""drank"" the coffee -- or she may flip back to liking you in a few weeks. For the long term, however, there is no way you can avoid triggering the fears of a pwBPD.

Although pwBPD typically crave intimacy and close friendships like nearly every other adult, they are too immature to handle such intimacy for very long. The result is that, when you become a close friend, whatever you do will be wrong much of the time. She will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO and hurtful when you DON'T.

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.

Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.

Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still in a room saying absolutely nothing. Are you sure you cannot afford nursing home care for a few weeks in August?"
relationship_advice,fr1yry9,t1_fr1mwu0,1589828224.0,"Girl, the four behaviors described above are red flags for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Importantly, I'm not suggesting your friend has full-blown BPD. Only a professional can determine that. Instead, I'm suggesting you consider whether she may be exhibiting a strong pattern of BPD symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD""). As noted below, you also seem to be describing red flags for sociopathy (""ASPD"" or Antisocial PD) and/or IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder) or PPD (Paranoid Personality Disorder).

**She still talks about someone who broke into her apartment for a cup of coffee.**

If your friend is a pwBPD, she carries enormous anger inside from early childhood. You therefore don't have to do a thing to CREATE the anger. Rather, you only have to do or say some minor thing that triggers a release of anger that is already there.

This is why a pwBPD can burst into a rage in only ten seconds. Moreover, pwBPD have very weak control over their emotions. Indeed, the key defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions. This is why ""Intense, inappropriate anger"" is one of the nine defining traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms ""anger,"" ""dangerous behavior,"" and ""unstable"" appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for BPD. See [9 BPD Traits](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

**I think you're right about her having a high level of paranoia.**

Another one of the 9 BPD symptoms is ""Suspiciousness of others thoughts about you, and even paranoid ideation."" See link cited above.

**The black-and-white thinking is pretty spot on.**

If your friend is a sociopath, she is incapable of loving anyone. If she is a pwBPD, however, she is capable of loving you but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a childish behavior called ""black-white thinking.""

Like a young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able to handle strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate). This means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. She thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind.

With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only ten seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to her as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action.

This B-W thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS...."" Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it is unusual for a BPDer to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends.

**I feel like constantly crying from the stress.**

If you have been close friends with a pwBPD for over a year, consider yourself lucky that you're only feeling *""stressed.""* A large share of the abused partners and close friends become so utterly confused they feel that they may be going crazy. Because pwBPD typically are convinced that the absurd allegations coming out of their mouths are absolutely true -- they generally have a greater ""crazy-making"" effect than can ever be achieved by narcissists or sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's diagnostic manual, BPD is the one most notorious for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their minds. Therapists typically see far more of those abused partners -- coming in to find out if they are going insane -- than they ever see of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a close friend or partner whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you. The reason is that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure out what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore her to that wonderful sweet woman you saw at the very beginning.

**She tends to have hatred for pretty much anyone who doesn't do what she wants.**

This hatred towards strangers is NOT a BPD trait. The vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people is able to trigger the BPDer's fears of abandonment and engulfment. There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment.

Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone makes the mistake of drawing very close to the pwBPD. This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in very difficult jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, teacher, surgeon, actor, or salesman. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

In contrast, the behavior you describe (hating strangers) is a red flag for ASPD (sociopathy), IED, or PPD (Paranoid Personality Disorder).

**So my friend, let call her Luna.**

If Luna is an untreated pwBPD, she is incapable of trusting you or anyone else who draws close. Indeed, she is so emotionally unstable that she is incapable of trusting herself. Because trust is the foundation on which all friendships must be based, Luna is simply incapable of being a close friend for very long. 

My BPD exW, for example, had a long series of best friends. She pushed all of them away within a period of 3 years. The only exception was a lady who lived 1,000 miles away. That friendship lasted 7 years.

**She took out the entire player out and replaced it with something she had gotten at Goodwill a couple of years before and had me go with her to return it.**

Again, her repeated stealing is a red flag for ASPD (Antisocial PD, aka ""sociopathy"").

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose her issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- and may help you decide when professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/) to see if most sound very familiar. If so and you have questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
mentalhealth,fr1p0hw,t1_fr1inc2,1589823512.0,"Semo, if your mother has only mild-to-moderate BPD traits, there are a few validation techniques you can learn that would help calm her down and give her a feeling of validation as to her feelings being real (but not necessarily facts). If her BPD traits are strong and persistent, however, all the validation in the world won't make a dent in her two fears -- because a pwBPD is unable to trust you and she lacks the self awareness and ego strength required to improve her behavior.

Most cities offer treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach a pwBPD the coping skills she never had an opportunity to learn in childhood. Such a program can teach her how to do self soothing; how to regulate her own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

It also can teach her how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your personality and devotion to her are essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Sadly, it is rare for a high functioning pwBPD to have the self awareness and ego strength to remain in such a program long enough (many years) to make a real difference. Like learning to play a grand piano, it takes many years of hard practice for a pwBPD to acquire those missing coping skills.

Hence, DBT is effective only if the pwBPD is self aware and strongly motivated to work hard for years in learning these skills. In my case, I spent a fortune sending my exW to 6 different psychologists (and taking her to 3 MCs) for weekly sessions for 15 years. Sadly, it did not make a dent in her behavior. Not one dent.

Semo, if your mother is an untreated pwBPD, the one thing that is certain is that you will see big improvements in her behavior. Like the smoker who is always throwing away his ""last pack"" every two months, she likely will make dramatic improvements about every 6 to 8 weeks. That's how unstable people behave. 

I mention this because, if you decide to put your life on hold to see if your mother is serious about working on her issues, it is going to be extremely difficult for you to know whether she is actually making any real, lasting improvement. Remember, even a roller coaster will be seen making dramatic gains half the time.

Semo, I suggest you take a look the [RaisedByBorderlines](https://old.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/) and the [BPDlovedones](https://old.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/) subs here at Reddit. I also recommend the book, *Stop Caretaking the Borderline or Narcissist: How to End the Drama and Get on with Life* -- by Margalis Fjelstad."

mentalhealth,fr0w9be,t3_gm0lsb,1589808206.0,"**I sometimes insult people (in my head) I love for no reason.**

I do that too, James. It is normal to have mixed feelings toward all your loved ones and close friends. Indeed, it is a sign of good mental health to be sufficiently mature to be able to tolerate having those strong mixed feelings (e.g., love and dislike) in your conscious mind at the same time. I mention this because young children and immature adults cannot do that. They have great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships.

They therefore ""split off"" one of the conflicting feelings, pushing it far out of reach of their conscious minds. With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only ten seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, an emotionally immature adult will categorize everyone close to him as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And he will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. 

This ""black-white thinking"" also will be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS...."" Because his close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it is unusual for very immature adults to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though they may have many casual friends.

Importantly, because it is normal human nature to occasionally get bad feelings toward people -- even those we love -- a parent usually teaches his young children that they are not responsible for those bad feelings but, rather, for how they choose to act on their feelings. 

They are responsible for their behavior, not for the multitude of conflicting feelings that pop into their heads. Hence, during the child's process of developing a strong and well integrated sense of self, an important step is the sudden realization that ""I am essentially a good little boy/girl who occasionally has very bad feelings and thoughts."" 

So the child is not burdened with a lifetime of unnecessary guilt, it is important that he/she understand that feelings arise from the emotional part of our mind, not the rational part. This is why mature adults are able to intellectually challenge the numerous conflicting feelings that pop into their minds. In contrast, immature adults typically accept all intense feelings as self-evident ""facts.""

**I'd like to understand why and find a cure to the problem.**

James, it is not obvious you have a problem that needs curing. As I said, being consciously in touch with your own conflicting mixed feelings about other people usually is a good thing. I am not a psychologist, however. Hence, if you are still seriously concerned about having these conflicting feelings, I would suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two -- to obtain a professional opinion."

The reason is that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure out what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore her to that wonderful sweet woman you saw at the very beginning.

**How can I stop her from playing me like a fiddle?**

To stop being controlled by her, it will help greatly to know how the game is being played -- i.e., to know what is motivating her. You will quickly realize that, although pwBPD generally are very controlling, they are not very good at manipulation. To be successful, manipulation requires careful planning and flawless execution. As you must know already, a pwBPD is far to impulsive and reactive to how she is feeling at this very moment to be any good at the ""flawless execution"" part. This is why, whenever she is trying to manipulate you, you will see her coming from a mile away.

It also will help greatly to know that whatever you do will be wrong much of the time. She will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T. Hence, you usually are in a no-win situation when it comes to trying to please her. 

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.

Hence, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear. (As you already must realize, your reaching the age of 18 has increased her abandonment fear because she knows she is losing her control over you as you become independent.)

In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears.

With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Mommy while she's bringing out the toys but, in only ten seconds, will flip to hating Mommy when she takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Mommy. Rather, it means that his conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to him as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And he will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action.

relationship_advice,fqyt453,t3_glkwgj,1589754110.0,"Blues, in young adolescents, cutting is associated with several disorders. In adults, however, the primary cause of cutting seems to be BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). 

A 2004 hospital study, for example, concluded that *""the majority of those who self-mutilate are women with borderline personality disorder. This complex, maladaptive behavior is used by clients as a means of self-preservation and emotion regulation, and is often associated with childhood trauma.""* See [J Psychosoc Nurs Ment Health Serv. 2004](http://www.loveshack.org/forums/breaking-up-reconciliation-coping/separation-divorce/557171-tough-decisions#post6640123).

This strong association in adults is why the APA's diagnostic manual (DSM-5) lists *""self-harming behavior such as cutting""* for only one disorder: BPD. That is, of the 157 disorders listed in DSM-5, only BPD has cutting listed in its list of defining symptoms. See [BPD Traits at NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml).

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose your partner's issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- and may help you decide when professional guidance is needed. I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/) to see if most sound very familiar.

relationship_advice,fqxclq8,t1_fqx9i35,1589729978.0,"**I sometimes feel like she doesn’t see that and expects more.**

Sandman, the human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults. To be clear, our perception of the *physical* world around us remains clear and undistorted. What becomes distorted is our perception of other peoples' intentions.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. And when we are very infatuated, we try to wait at least 2 years before buying the rings. By the time we are in high school, nearly all of us already know that we cannot trust our own judgment of people while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pregnant woman is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because her hormone storm prevents her from properly regulating her own emotions. This means that she experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.  

Importantly, this inability to control one's own emotions can be caused by any surge in hormones -- e.g., puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, PMS, or perimenopause (or, LOL, any other life event starting with the letter ""P""). I mention this because you may see this behavior again after childbirth if your W experiences postpartum depression, which usually lasts a few weeks but may last longer."

Your GF really needs professional help and her parents can see that she gets it. It thus is important that her parents know about the cutting and suicide attempts. One option is to tell them yourself or, if you fear that would trigger your GF's rage, you might ask your parents to tell them.

Your GF sounds similar to my exW. If that is the case, her self destructive behaviors may arise from her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs you have not mentioned. 

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER. Moreover, she would HATE being alone by herself.

Second, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

This B-W thinking also would manifest itself in the form of her seeing all your actions towards friends and family as a ""zero-sum game."" That is, she views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to her. Hence, she views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between her and other people. She is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier man, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie.

Third, you would rarely (if ever) see her expressing anger to casual friends, classmates, or total strangers. Rather, her temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

Fourth, you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly.

relationship_advice,fqtl2cj,t3_gkuoyq,1589641087.0,"**My darling not so nice guy was diagnosed as bipolar.**

Throw, perhaps your abusive H does have bipolar (BP). Did he say he was diagnosed as having BP-1 or BP-2? I assume you're talking about BP-2 because you don't mention him exhibiting any strong mania.

**He wasn't always an asshole but holy shit the years didn't do him well.**

Did your H's abusive behaviors start appearing about 6 months into your 15-year relationship (i.e., appearing when his infatuation was fading)?  If not, please disregard this comment. If so, I would suggest you familiarize yourself with the warning signs (i.e., symptoms) for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  There are several reasons why it would be prudent for you to know how to spot these red flags.

First, you have not yet mentioned any bipolar symptoms. On the contrary, the verbal and physical abuse you mention are far more characteristic of BPD. Second, it is common for therapists to mistake BPD for bipolar, especially when they have seen the patient only a few times. 

Third, even if your H does have bipolar, it is common for these two disorders to occur together. About 30% of bipolar sufferers also have BPD -- and about 40% of people with BPD (pwBPD) have co-occurring bipolar. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/). 

Fourth, because both of these disorders are believed to be hereditary to a large extent, there is some risk that the disorder(s) was passed on to your son or step children. (If that had actually occurred, the BPD symptoms likely would not have started showing strongly until the early-to-mid teens.)

I mention all this because the distinction between these two disorders is very important. Whereas bipolar is caused by a change in body chemistry, BPD is believed to be caused by something occurring before age 5 (heredity and/or a childhood trauma) that prevents the child from acquiring the coping skills needed to regulate his own emotions and establish a strong, stable self identity.

Hence, whereas bipolar oftentimes can be treated quite successfully by swallowing a pill, BPD can only by treated by years of hard work -- in a weekly therapy program such as DBT or CBT -- to acquire those missing coping skills. Like learning to play a piano, learning those skills takes many years of practice and strong commitment.

**We are working on a separation agreement.**

I suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you and the 3 children are dealing with. If you decide that your H has been exhibiting strong BPD warning signs for over 14 years, it is important to see YOUR OWN psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated your H. In that way, you're ensured that the psych is ethically bound to protect YOUR best interests, not his.

Seeing his psychologist for candid advice during the courtship would be as foolish as seeing his attorney for candid advice during a divorce. I mention this because therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of his disorder. They often decide that it is not in his best interests to be told.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose his issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for breast cancer or a heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., remaining in a toxic relationship or running into the arms of another man just like him. Learning the red flags also can help you decide when professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my discussions in [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/) and in [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/). If most of the BPD traits sound very familiar and you have questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
abusiverelationships,fqrpeiq,t1_fqrj491,1589589092.0,"Whereas a pwBPD can truly love you, a sociopath lacks that ability. Whereas a pwBPD can have great *affective* empathy (i.e., can FEEL what another person is feeling unless that person is being split black), a sociopath lacks affective empathy. 

A sociopath nonetheless usually has great *cognitive* empathy (i.e., can intellectually UNDERSTAND how that other person must be feeling). This ability makes them especially skillful at manipulate people. (When a pwBPD is splitting you white, he likely has both affective and cognitive empathy.)

Whereas a pwBPD is very controlling in an impulsive way, a sociopath usually is a master of manipulation, which requires careful planning and flawless execution of that plan. PwBPD usually are too reactive -- to whatever intense feeling they are experiencing at the moment -- to be any good at manipulation. They usually fail at the ""flawless execution"" part. PwBPD nonetheless are very controlling (in a reactive way) due to their two great fears.

Whereas a pwBPD is emotionally unstable, a sociopath typically is very stable. Whereas a pwBPD usually will not lie (unless there is absolutely no other way of escaping humiliation), a sociopath has no trouble whatsoever in fabricating many lies. 

Significantly, I am speaking of people who only have either BPD or ASPD (sociopathy). But usually it is more complicated than this because most people having a full-blown personality disorder also have one or two other PDs as well. This is embarrassing to the American psychiatric community because they know that each individual has only one personality. They therefore are currently studying a proposal to reduce the number of PDs from 10 to 6 (but BPD, ASPD, and NPD would be retained as part of the 6)."
abusiverelationships,fqrdhnv,t1_fqr7jyw,1589582222.0,"**He did everything you mentioned!** 

Iron, the four behaviors described above   are red flags for  BPD  (Borderline  Personality Disorder).    Importantly, I'm not  suggesting your exBF has full-blown BPD.  Only a   professional can  determine that.  Instead, I'm  suggesting  you    consider whether he may be exhibiting a  moderate-to-strong pattern of  BPD   symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD"").

If   your exBF actually is a pwBPD, he carries  enormous anger inside from   early childhood. You therefore don't have  to do a thing to CREATE  the  anger.   Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor thing that   triggers a release of anger that is already  there.  This is why a   pwBPD can   burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.  

Moreover, pwBPD   have very weak control over their emotions.  Indeed, the key defining   characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions. This is why *""Intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms *""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [9 Traits at BPDdemystified](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

 **I know he loved me or at least the idea of me.** 

If   your exBF is a pwBPD, Iron, he is capable  of loving you very intensely but it   is the very immature type of love  you see in young children.  This   means he will occasionally flip -- in   only  ten seconds -- from   Jekyll  (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or   hating you).  And a few   hours or days later,  he can flip back again  just as quickly.   These   rapid flips arise from a childish behavior  called *""black-white thinking.""*

Like    a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able   to     handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and hate).  This      means  he   has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties,      and the  other gray areas of  close interpersonal relationships. He    thus will  subconsciously split off the conflicting  feeling,     putting  it far out of  reach of his conscious mind.

With  young  children, this  ""splitting"" is  evident when the child will  adore Mommy  while she's  bringing out the  toys  but, in only ten   seconds,  will  flip to hating  Mommy when she  takes one  toy away.

Similarly,    a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to him as  ""all  good""    (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"").   And he will  recategorize   someone from one polar extreme to the other  -- in just ten seconds --   based solely on a  minor  comment or action.

This     B-W  thinking also will be evident in his frequent use of   all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""     Because his close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it  is   unusual  for a BPDer to have any really close *long-term* friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though he may have many casual friends.

Of  course,  learning to   spot BPD warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose his  issues.      Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy to  spot,  only a      professional   can determine  whether they are so severe and  persistent      as to   constitute a   full-blown disorder.

As you back away from one fear, you necessarily are drawing close to triggering the other. Sadly, there is no Goldilocks position (between ""too far"" and ""too close"") where you can safely stand. If such a position ever does exist, it has the width of a knife edge and is constantly shifting."
relationship_advice,fqpsd6b,t1_fqodtgr,1589553079.0,"**She is quite spoiled.** 

Spoiling a child is an insidious form of child abuse. When a parent is always saying ""Here, let me do that for you,"" he is effectively saying ""You are incompetent and incapable of learning to do it correctly."" Similarly, when a parent always protects the child from the logical consequences of her bad choices and bad behavior, the parent is effectively saying ""We don't expect you to be responsible for anything because you are incapable of such things.""

 **She's also shown strong signs of NPD as well.** 

About 73% of pwBPD also have a second personality disorder as well.  An American study of 35,000 randomly selected adults found that, for female pwBPD, 32% also have co-occurring NPD. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

 **I always trick myself into thinking if I just did more for her she'd be happy but then it never seems to be enough.**

Pete, if she is an untreated pwBPD, it is impossible for you -- through sacrifices and  gifts -- to build up a store of appreciation  and good will on which  you could later draw during the hard times. Like a  young child, a  pwBPD's perception of you is fully dictated by whatever  intense feeling  she is experiencing AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

Hence, trying to build up a lasting store of appreciation is as   futile as trying to build a lasting sandcastle on the shore beside the   sea. It will be washed aside by the next tide of intense feelings   flooding her mind.

A pwBPD is  so emotionally immature that she has an extremely weak sense of *""object  constancy.""*  That is, she cannot trust you over time because she doesn't realize   that your love, commitment, and personality are essentially constant   from day to day and week to week.

 **Is BPD capable of being treated?** 

 Pete, most cities offer treatment   programs  (e.g., DBT, TFP, or CBT) that can teach a pwBPD the coping  skills  she never  had an opportunity to learn in childhood. Such a  program can teach her how to do self soothing; how to regulate  her own  emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings  instead of  accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

It  also can teach her how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the  room  instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to   perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your personality and   devotion to her are essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid   black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings,   uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal   relationships.

Sadly, it is  rare  for a high functioning pwBPD to have the self awareness and ego   strength to remain in such a program long enough (many years) to make a   real difference.  Like learning to play a grand piano, it takes many  years of hard   practice for a pwBPD to acquire the missing coping  skills.

Hence, DBT is   effective  only if the pwBPD is self aware and strongly motivated to   work hard  for many years in learning these skills.  As to going to a MC, my  experience  is that MC is totally useless until the pwBPD has had at  least several  years of individual therapy to address her underlying  issues.

In  my case, I spent a small fortune sending my exW to 6 different   psychologists (and taking her to 3 MCs) for weekly sessions for 15   years.  Sadly, it did not make a dent in her behavior.  Not one dent.

If  your exGF is an untreated pwBPD, the one thing that is certain is  that  you will see big improvements in her behavior.  Like the smoker who is   always throwing away his ""last  pack"" every two months, she likely will   make dramatic improvements about  every 6 to 8 weeks. That's  how unstable people behave. 

I mention this because, if you   decide to  put your life on hold to see if she is serious about working   on her  issues, it is going to be extremely difficult for you to know   whether  she is actually making any real, lasting improvement. Remember,   even a  roller coaster is making dramatic gains half the time."

They may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs you have not mentioned explicitly.

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER. Moreover, she would HATE being alone by herself.

Second, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

This B-W thinking also would manifest itself in the form of her seeing all your actions towards friends and family as a ""zero-sum game."" That is, she views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to her. 

Hence, she views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between her and other people. She is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier man, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie.

Third, you would not see her expressing her anger to total strangers (e.g., road rage against strangers). Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

Fourth, you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. Have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?"
relationship_advice,fqlsd54,t1_fqkyfvn,1589465156.0,"**Like me, her parents and sister have dealt with her outbursts too but she acts completely charming to everyone else.**

Pete, the  vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they typically   hold   jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual     friends, and total strangers.  This good behavior does NOT occur because she chooses to control herself around those people.  On the contrary, a pwBPD lacks such control because she never had the opportunity to learn the emotional skills needed to control her own emotions.

Rather, it occurs because none of  those people is able to   trigger her fears of abandonment and  engulfment.  There is no   close  relationship that can be abandoned and no  intimacy to trigger   the  suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence,  with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually   appear only  when  someone makes the mistake of drawing very close  to the pwBPD.

This is  why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to  excel in very difficult  jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, teacher, surgeon, actor, or  salesman.  And   this is why most pwBPD  can be considerate and friendly  all day long to   complete strangers --  but will go home at night to  abuse the very  people who love them.

**She's in a hurry to get married and have kids.**

Pete, if you ever feel tempted to marry this woman, I would suggest you see a psychologist to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you -- and your future children -- will be dealing with.  If you decide that many strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is  important to see YOUR OWN psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated or seen her.

In that way, you're ensured that the psych is ethically bound to  protect YOUR best interests, not hers. I mention this because therapists  generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of her  disorder.  They often decide that it is not in her best interests to be  told.

Of  course,  learning to  spot BPD warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose her   issues.     Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy to  spot,  only a     professional   can determine  whether they are so severe and  persistent     as to   constitute a   full-blown disorder.

Yet,  like learning  warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning  those for  BPD may  help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g.,   remaining  in a toxic relationship or running into the arms  of    another woman  just  like her.  Learning the red  flags also can  help   you  decide when  professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [**18 BPD Warning Signs**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/)  to see if most sound very familiar.   If so and you have questions, Pete, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
relationship_advice,fqlsazo,t1_fqkyfvn,1589465123.0,"**That's scary how accurate those descriptions fit.** 

Pete, the four behaviors described above  are red flags for  BPD  (Borderline  Personality Disorder).   Importantly, I'm not  suggesting your fiance has full-blown BPD.  Only a  professional can  determine that.  Instead, I'm  suggesting  you   consider whether she may be a person with  moderate-to-strong BPD  symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD""). 

**She slammed the door so hard the frame popped out.** 

If  your fiance actually is a pwBPD, she carries  enormous anger inside from  early childhood.  You therefore don't have  to do a thing to CREATE  the anger.   Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor thing that  triggers a release of anger that is already  there.

This  is why a pwBPD can   burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.  Moreover,  pwBPD have very weak control over their emotions.  Indeed, the key  defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own  emotions.  This is why *""Intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms *""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [**9 BPD Traits**](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

 **I suspect my infidelity led to the abandonment issues.** 

Perhaps so, Pete. That seems very unlikely, however. Given that it occurred only once and was 6.5 years ago, and given that her abandonment fear is very strong, I suspect it originated in early childhood, as occurs when a person suffers strong BPD traits. 

Do you know if she had a rough childhood, particularly before age 5? Or does she have a parent with a personality disorder?  I ask because a strong abandonment fear is such a key feature of BPD that it is listed as one of the 9 defining symptoms. (See symptom list at link cited above.)

**At this point I still love her very much.** 

If  your fiance is a pwBPD, she likely loves you too. A pwBPD is capable  of loving you very intensely -- but it  is the very immature type of love  you see in young children.  This  means she will occasionally flip -- in   only  ten seconds -- from  Jekyll  (loving you) to Hyde (devaluing or   hating you).  And a few  hours or days later,  she can flip back again  just as quickly.   These  rapid flips arise from a childish behavior  called *""black-white thinking.""*

Like   a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able   to    handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and hate).  This     means  she   has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties,     and the  other gray areas of  close interpersonal relationships. She   thus will  subconsciously split off the conflicting  feeling,    putting  it far out of  reach of her conscious mind.

With  young children, this  ""splitting"" is  evident when the child will adore  Daddy while he's  bringing out the  toys  but, in only ten  seconds,   will flip to hating  Daddy when he  takes one  toy away. Importantly,   this behavior does  not  mean that the child has  stopped loving Daddy.    Rather, it means  that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch   with those loving feelings.

Similarly,   a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to her as  ""all  good""   (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"").   And she will  recategorize  someone from one polar extreme to the other  -- in just ten seconds --  based solely on a  minor  comment or action.

This    B-W  thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of  all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""    Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it  is  unusual  for a BPDer to have any really close *long-term* friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends.

 **She can be a really wonderful and loving person.**

Most pwBPD are caring and loving individuals. Their problem is not being BAD but, rather, being UNSTABLE.  

A pwBPD typically  exhibits the   warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability,  and purity of  expressions that   otherwise are seen only in young children. As  any  parent can tell you,  young children are VERY EASY to fall  in love  with.

It  thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most  beloved  women  --  Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Princess Diana -- all had  full-blown  BPD  if  their biographers are correct.

Indeed,    it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard  to  walk   away from. Because you are essentially in a parent/child    relationship,  leaving is so painful because it feels like you're    abandoning a young  child who -- despite her frequent temper tantrums -- must dearly love  and need you.

**She's shown some really ugly sides of her and the thought of becoming one of those abused husbands terrifies me.** 

Pete, if  you actually have been in a 7-year relationship with a pwBPD, consider yourself lucky that  you're only  feeling ""terrified"" at the thought of marriage. A large share of the abused partners become so utterly confused that they feel like they may be going crazy.  

Because pwBPD typically are convinced  that the  absurd allegations  coming out of their mouths are absolutely  true --  they generally have a  greater ""crazy-making""  effect than can  ever be  achieved by  narcissists or sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's  diagnostic manual, BPD is the *one most notorious*   for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their   minds.  Therapists typically see far more of those  abused partners --  coming in to find out if they are going insane --  than they ever see   of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing   will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a partner   whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you.  The  reason  is   that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure out   what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore her  to that  wonderful sweet   woman you saw at the very beginning."

Pete, have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?"
mentalhealth,fqkt5l2,t3_gjfniu,1589435560.0,"**My brain doesn’t really react to things or process them as they happen.**

Mate, you seem to be describing dissociation. At a mild level, dissociation is a primitive ego defense that we all do many times a day in the form of day dreaming.  A common example of this is suddenly realizing, while driving, that you have been driving for 10 minutes and cannot recall any of it. You know that you drove through 3 lighted intersections but cannot even recall seeing them. 

Similarly, there likely have been times that you've walked to the kitchen to get some food out of the refrigerator. By the time you arrive at the refrigerator, however, you have started daydreaming and have trouble recalling what you had intended to get. 

In both of those examples, your subconscious is carefully driving you through 3 lighted intersections and carefully walking you around the living room furniture -- while your conscious mind is daydreaming about something a hundred miles away or 2 weeks in the past. Importantly, these are normal occurrences of dissociation and they typically occur whenever we get bored or stressed and want to escape our surroundings for a short while.

When a person's stress levels are much higher, however, he may retreat to dissociation so frequently -- as a way of disconnecting from his painful feelings or memories -- that he becomes disconnected from his surroundings most of the time and starts to feel so numb that he may even feel like he has lost his ability to be in touch with his feelings. As you say, *""My brain doesn't react to things or process them as they happen""* and *""I don’t really feel much emotion 24/7.""* 

Indeed, if the person doesn't seek therapy, dissociation can get so strong that the person gets a scary feeling of being robotic -- i.e., of being unable to feel anything. At that point, it is common for people to start cutting or hitting themselves to get a feeling on the outside of his body, thus being able to feel human again.  Of course, that behavior is harmful and self destructive.

**HOW the heck is there any saving me at this point.**

Mate, you don't need ""saving"" by anyone. With professional guidance, you will be capable of saving yourself. I therefore suggest you see a psychologist to obtain a professional opinion on what issue you're dealing with. If the psych determines that you actually are dissociating too frequently and strongly, he/she likely would refer you to one of the many therapy programs that treat this problem. Because it is a common problem, most cities offer treatment programs (e.g., CBT and DBT) that can teach you how to better control your own thoughts and emotions so you can reduce your stress without using dissociation as an escape. 

Such programs teach many coping skills that you can use. One of the first coping skills that usually is taught in such a program is how to be ""mindful,"" i.e., how to remain in the present and be aware of what is occurring around you instead of escaping -- through daydreaming -- into the past or future.

**I think this has been happening since childhood.**

If you actually are dissociating frequently, there is a good chance you experienced a trauma in early childhood that prevented you from learning several important emotional skills that are needed to regulate your own emotions so that your feelings are not so intense that you feel a need to escape from them through dissociation. But there can be other causes of dissociation too. I therefore encourage you to discuss this with your psychologist and, if you experienced a childhood trauma (e.g., from heredity and/or abuse or abandonment), be sure to mention that during your discussion."

Struggling, I've been inside numerous psychiatric wards visiting my bipolar-1 son and my BPD exW whenever they were very sick. There is nothing terrifying about any of the wards I've been inside. They are deliberately designed to be very calm and boring so that patients feel comfortable and not threatened.

**I've gone to doctors but can't get any help.**

Struggling, have you been to a psychiatrist to find out what is causing you to be so depressed and fatigued?  I ask because, if a psychiatrist determines that being in a psychiatric hospital would be helpful, he/she should be able to refer you to many such hospitals in your area. 

Please keep in mind that, if you're suffering from depression, the treatment is a combination of medication and therapy. I mention this because it can take several months to find the right medication and right dosage level for your body. It may take much longer for therapy to have a substantial effect because it is something you have to keep practicing and working at. 

This means that, unless you are a danger to yourself or others, there may be no advantage to being locked away in a psychiatric center.

**She will get super mad and sometimes will punch her leg till I show my soft side.**

PerC, the APA's diagnostic manual (DSM-5) lists *""self-injurious behavior such as cutting or hitting yourself""* for only one disorder: BPD. That is, of the 157 disorders listed in DSM-5, only BPD has self-harming behavior like hitting listed in its list of defining symptoms. See link cited above.

**I love her so much.**

If your GF is a pwBPD, she likely loves you too. A pwBPD is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a childish behavior called ""black-white thinking.""

Like a young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able to handle strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate).

**I feel like i’m going insane.**

If you have been dating a pwBPD for 18 months, that is pretty much how you SHOULD be feeling. A large share of the abused partners become so utterly confused they start to feel like they are going crazy. Because pwBPD typically are convinced that the absurd allegations coming out of their mouths are absolutely true -- they generally have a greater ""crazy-making"" effect than can ever be achieved by narcissists or sociopaths.

**She doesn’t show these bad side to her friends but only to me.**

The vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. None of those people is able to trigger the pwBPD's fears of abandonment and engulfment. There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment.

Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone makes the mistake of drawing very close to the pwBPD. This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in very difficult jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, teacher, surgeon, actor, or salesman. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

**It feels like i’m walking on thin ice every day.**

This enabling behavior is harmful to both of you. It is harmful to her because it is important she be allowed to suffer the logical consequences of her own bad behavior and bad choices. Otherwise, you are destroying the incentives she has to confront her own issues and seek therapy.

It is harmful to you because, by not behaving like your true self, you are starting to lose touch with your own self identity. This toxic situation is why the best-selling BPD book (published in 8 languages and targeted to the abused partners) is titled *Stop Walking on Eggshells.*

Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

relationship_advice,fq7oq3r,t1_fq7g6n4,1589149245.0,"**Please don’t start diagnosing people with BPD.** 

Canada, I assure you that nobody in this thread has done that. You're confusing ***spotting warning signs*** with ***making a diagnosis***.  There is a world of difference between the two.  

Hundreds of mental  health centers list the symptoms for BPD and   other disorders on their  public websites to encourage the lay public to   learn how to spot warning signs.  They know that, when laymen are able   to spot these  warning signs, they are far more likely to see a   professional to obtain a  diagnosis.  And they will do so much more quickly.

As I state above, *""Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to  diagnose your W's issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot,  only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and  persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.""*"
BPDlovedones,fq7dfc7,t3_gh69wv,1589144952.0,"**What about a decade? Could he truly have been hiding his true self for that long?**

No, Throw, a pwBPD does not have the emotional skills to ""hide his true self"" for a decade. BPD is believed to be fully formed in the child's mind by age 4, thereby preventing him from learning the many emotional skills needed to control his own impulses and other emotions. It also prevents him from developing a strong sense of who he actually is. 

Granted, a pwBPD typically will not exhibit his strong BPD traits during the initial 4 to 6 months of the relationship. However, that absence of BPD traits is not due to his skill at hiding them. During that time, he has no strong BPD traits that need to be hidden. 

The reason is that his infatuation with you convinces him that you are the nearly perfect woman who has arrived to rescue him from unhappiness. In that way, the infatuation holds his two fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at bay. When the infatuation eventually evaporates, both fears return and you cannot avoid triggering them. At that point -- not ten years later -- you would start seeing strong BPD traits because a pwBPD lacks the skills needed to control his own emotions."
relationship_advice,fq756or,t1_fq6rpga,1589141937.0,"28F, if a hormone change and drug abuse can be ruled out, the remaining two most common causes for explosive anger are BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder). The reason I asked about who is able to trigger your H's rage is that IED can be triggered by anyone (as occurs when road rage occurs among total strangers on the highway). 

With BPD, however, it usually is only the loved ones who are able to trigger the rage outbursts. The vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning."" This means that they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. 

None of those people is able to trigger the BPDer's fears of abandonment and engulfment. There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone (e.g., a casual friend) makes the mistake of drawing close to the pwBPD. 

This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in very difficult jobs such as being a social worker, teacher, surgeon, professional actor, or salesman. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

Importantly, I'm not suggesting your H has full-blown BPD. Only a professional can determine that. Instead, I'm suggesting you consider whether he is exhibiting a strong pattern of BPD symptoms (i.e., is a ""pwBPD"").

**He has choked me, pushed me into things, hit me, grabbed me, pulled my hair, all on separate occasions over the past 2 years that we’ve been married.**

One of the nine defining traits for BPD is ""Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g, frequent displays of temper, constant anger, or recurrent physical fights)."" See [9 BPD Symptoms at Medscape](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/913575-overview). Most pwBPD DO NOT physically abuse their partners.

A substantial share of pwBPD, however, are physical abusers. Indeed, more than 30 empirical studies have found a strong association between spousal battering and BPD. One of the first studies showing that link is a 1993 hospital study of spousal batterers. It found that nearly all of them have a personality disorder and half of them have BPD. See Roger Melton's summary of that study at [50% of Batterers Have BPD](http://www.sott.net/articles/show/149774-Romeo-s-Bleeding-When-Mr-Right-Turns-Out-To-Be-Mr-Wrong).

The pwBPD typically carry enormous anger inside from early childhood. You therefore don't have to do a thing to CREATE the anger. Rather, you only have to do or say some minor thing that triggers a release of the anger that is already there. This is why a pwBPD can burst into a rage in only ten seconds. Moreover, they have very weak control over their emotions. Indeed, the key defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions.

**He struggles with his own mental illness. He was neglected a lot as a kid and wasn’t ever really given the tools to face his shortcomings in a healthy way.**

In a 2008 American study, 70% of the pwBPD reported they had been abused or abandoned in childhood. Significantly, when a trauma occurs in adolescence or adulthood, it can result in PTSD. When it occurs in early childhood, however, it can be far more damaging because it is believed to halt the child's emotional development at about age 4, the very age at which children usually develop an integrated sense of self. When a trauma occurs at that young age, it can freeze the child's emotional development. The child therefore has no opportunity to learn important emotional skills

**My own impulse control issues have never led me to assault anyone.**

Bipolar mood changes are believed to arise from gradual chemical changes in the body. Because bipolar usually does not appear until ages 18 to 30, the person has already learned the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions and control impulses. This is why your impulse control issues likely only exist while you are experiencing a bipolar mood episode. When that episode ends, you likely have normal control of your impulses.

In contrast, a pwBPD never had an opportunity in childhood to learn the emotional coping skills needed to control impulses very well. As I noted above, it is believed that a childhood trauma (from heredity and/or abuse or abandonment) freezes the child's emotional development at about age 4, preventing him from developing a strong self image and from learning those coping skills that are needed for controlling his own emotions.

**What do I do?**

Even if you have to go out of network, it is important that you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. Without treatment, your H's rages and physical abuse likely will get worse, putting your life at risk.

Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see YOUR OWN psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated your H. In that way, you're ensured that the psych is ethically bound to protect YOUR best interests, not his.

Seeing his psychologist for candid advice during the marriage would be as foolish as seeing his attorney for candid advice during a divorce. I mention this because therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD (or tell his W) the name of his disorder. They often decide that it is not in his best interests to be told.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose his issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., remaining in a toxic relationship or running into the arms of another man just like him. Learning the red flags also can help you decide whether professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/) to see if most sound very familiar. If so and you have questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you."

I caution that BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

At issue, then, is not whether you exhibit BPD traits. Of course you do. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong level (i.e., are on the upper end of the BPD spectrum)."
relationship_advice,fq4dzw9,t3_ggrnwm,1589076584.0,"**She suffers from BPD, depression, anxiety**

RCE, nearly all pwBPD (people with BPD) have 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders such as PTSD, OCD, depression, bipolar, anxiety, or ADHD. A 2008 study of 35,000 American adults found that 81% of female pwBPD also have a co-occurring anxiety disorder and 80% also have a mood disorder such as depression. It therefore is not surprising that your BPD GF also suffers from both depression and anxiety.

**She is on a medication she likes.**

Medication cannot make a dent in BPD. As noted above, the reason that nearly all pwBPD are prescribed medication is that the meds are targeted to treating the 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders. The meds do not treat BPD itself.

**She needs to know right that second what the definite plan is for tonight.**

Because a pwBPD has low self esteem and has a great fear of abandonment, she lives in fear that -- once you realize how empty she is on the inside -- you will walk away. Because she believes that this rejection may be inevitable, she is extremely sensitive to changes in her daily circumstances. For example, if plans suddenly change or appointments are canceled, a pwBPD may react very inappropriately with anger or panic.

**It bothers me that she’s letting past experiences effect her current one.**

A pwBPD is not letting her past experiences with exBFs affect your relationship. Rather, her BPD was fully formed by the time she was 4 or 5 years old. This is why her emotional development was frozen at the level of a 4-year old, thereby preventing her from developing a strong self image and learning the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions. 

I mention this so as to explain why she is not ""letting"" her past experiences affect you. Until she has worked hard for many years in therapy, she likely is doing her best given her inability to control her own emotions -- and given her lack of a strong self identity.

**This is not the first time I’ve been accused of such a thing.**

Until she has had many years of treatment, whatever you do will be wrong much of the time. She will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T.

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.

Hence, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Although she craves intimacy like other adults do, she is far too immature to be able to tolerate it for very long. 

This is why her very WORST behavior typically occurs immediately after an intimate evening or great weekend -- or right in the middle of an expensive vacation or 3-day holiday. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.

In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.

Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still in a room saying absolutely nothing.

**I love her to death**

She likely loves you too. A pwBPD  is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a childish behavior called ""black-white thinking.""

Like a young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able to handle strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate). This means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. She thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind.

With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only ten seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to her as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action.

This B-W thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS...."" Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it is unusual for a BPDer to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends."

Perhaps you're right about her ""gaining confidence"" when living away from your family and by using your son to threaten you. Another possibility, however, is that she could have a hormone problem -- called ""postpartum depression"" -- that is common after giving birth. It typically lasts only 3 or 4 months -- not 9 months. But it sometimes does last a year or two. 

On the other hand, if PPD were the problem, it likely would have started shortly after your son's birth 9 months ago -- instead of starting 5 months ago when you moved to the apartment. I nonetheless believe it would be prudent for your W to ask her doctor to have her hormone levels checked."

27F, if you suffer from BPD, those episodes are not called ""manic"" but, rather, ""temper tantrums."" Mania typically occurs when a bipolar-1 sufferer experiences a gradual change in body chemistry. Such mania usually takes several days or a week to fully develop. In contrast, you're describing an angry outburst of rage (i.e., temper tantrum) that usually is triggered in less than a minute by some event (something your BF says or does).

**I start having these manic episodes and can't calm down.**

If you have BPD, the reason you ""can't calm down"" is not due to mania but, rather, your inability to regulate your own emotions. If you actually do exhibit mania quite frequently, you may suffer from both BPD and bipolar. About 33% of female pwBPD also suffer from co-occurring bipolar-1 (which exhibits strong manic periods).

**I was diagnosed with impulsive borderline personality disorder.**

There is no subcategory of BPD called ""impulsive BPD."" All people with BPD (pwBPD) are impulsive. The lack of impulse control is a key feature of BPD because a pwBPD cannot control his/her own emotions.

**I am not sure if ""disease"" was the appropriate word.**

BPD generally is not referred to as a ""disease"" but, rather, an ""illness"" or ""disorder."" A ""disease"" is a particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause. This definition does not apply to BPD or other mental disorders because nobody can yet prove what causes any of them.

**The mean and hurtful things I say I don't mean.**

If you are a pwBPD, you very likely do mean those things while you are saying them. Generally, a pwBPD truly believes the outrageous accusations coming out of his mouth while he is so angry. The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. And when we are very infatuated, we try to wait at least two years before buying the rings. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings such as infatuation and anger.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.

If you suffer from BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions. They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to regulate your own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships."
BreakUps,fpujurc,t3_gfixjw,1588914805.0,"**""I discovered that she is Bipolar.""**

Perhaps so, Tom. Did she say it is BP-1 or BP-2? I  assume you're talking about BP-2 because you don't mention her  exhibiting any strong mania.  If you two ever start dating again, I would suggest you familiarize yourself with the warning signs (i.e., symptoms)  for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

I  mention BPD to you for several reasons. First, the behaviors you describe -- e.g., her rapid flips between Jekyll (adoring you) and Hyde (devaluing you) and her event-triggered temper tantrums -- sound much closer to the warning signs for BPD than for bipolar.

Second, therapists sometimes mistake BPD for bipolar.  And third, these two disorders oftentimes occur together. About 30% of  bipolar sufferers also have BPD and about 40% of people with BPD (pwBPD)  have co-occurring bipolar. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

If  you ever consider reconciling with this young lady or cohabiting with her, the  distinction between these two disorders is very important.  Whereas  bipolar is caused by a change in body chemistry, BPD is believed to be  caused by a trauma occurring before age 5 (heredity and/or childhood abuse or abandonment) that prevents the child from acquiring the coping skills needed  to regulate her own emotions and establish a strong, stable self  identity.

Hence, whereas bipolar  oftentimes can be treated quite successfully by swallowing a pill, BPD  can only by treated by many years of hard work -- in a weekly therapy program  such as DBT or CBT -- to acquire those missing coping skills.  Like  learning to play a piano, learning those skills takes many years of practice  and strong commitment.

Consequently, if you ever decide to date her again, I would suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. If your GF is a pwBPD (person with moderate-to-strong BPD traits), she is capable  of loving you very intensely but it is the very immature type of love  you see in young children.

This means she will occasionally flip -- in   only  ten seconds -- from Jekyll  (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or even hating you).  And a few hours or days later,  she can flip back again  just as quickly.   These rapid flips arise from a childish behavior  called *""black-white thinking.""*

Like  a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able   to   handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and hate).

Similarly,  a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to her as  ""all  good""  (i.e., ""with me"") or ""all bad"" (i.e., ""against me"").   And she will  recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a  minor  comment or action.

This   B-W  thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""

relationship_advice,fptpubg,t3_gfhj90,1588895861.0,"Sirahs, your friend's abusive behavior and anger issues cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained. They may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER. Moreover, she would HATE being alone by herself.

Second, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

This B-W thinking also would manifest itself in the form of her seeing all your actions towards friends and family as a ""zero-sum game."" That is, she views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to her. 

Hence, she views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between her and other people. She is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier man, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie.

Third, you usually would not see her expressing her anger to casual friends, coworkers, and total strangers. Rather, her temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one or best friend (e.g., against YOU or her parents).

Fourth, you often would see her flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes ""walking on eggshells,"" as you say. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. Have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?"
abusiverelationships,fptecy7,t3_gffkio,1588889707.0,"**He is constantly on an eruptive knife edge and becoming really REALLY illogical**

Jasper, if your H exhibits moderate-to-strong BPD traits (i.e., is a ""pwBPD"") as you suspect, whatever you do will be wrong much of the time. You will be wrong if you DO something and wrong if you DON'T. 

This conundrum is due to the position of his two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming his abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers his engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming his engulfment fear (moving back away to give him breathing space) is the very action that triggers his abandonment fear.

Hence, as you move close to comfort him and assure him of your love, you eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making him feel like he's being suffocated and controlled by you. Although a pwBPD typically craves intimacy like other adults, he cannot tolerate it for very long (hence the increase in problems you are seeing while he is cooped up with you in the home). 

This intolerance of sustained largely arises from his weak and unstable sense of identity, which prevents him from developing personal boundaries. That is, he has great difficulty recognizing where HIS feelings/problems stop and YOURS begin. 

This lack of personal boundaries is why he often feels suffocated and controlled by you. And it is why his very WORST behavior typically occurs immediately after the very BEST of times -- i.e., after an intimate evening or great weekend or right in the middle of an expensive vacation or 3-day holiday. This behavior reveals his ""fear of engulfment."" Yet, as you back away to give him breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering his abandonment fear.

In my 15 years with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate his own emotions and tame his two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. His subconscious does this to protect his fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside his body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, he will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.

Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD having strong symptoms, you will often find yourself hurting him -- i.e., triggering his engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering his abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering his anger even when you are sitting still in a room saying absolutely nothing.

**Rages in response to a litany of perceived slights.**

This is a good example of a behavior called ""black-white thinking."" If your H is a pwBPD, he is capable of loving you very intensely but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means he will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, he can flip back again just as quickly.

Like a young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able to handle strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate). This means he has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. He thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of his conscious mind. 

With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Mommy while she's bringing out the toys but, in only ten seconds, will flip to hating Mommy when she takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Mommy. Rather, it means that his conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.

Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to him as ""all good"" (i.e., ""white"" or ""with me"") or ""all bad"" (i.e., ""black"" or ""against me""). And he will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just ten seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action.

**He has never once apologized to me for anything, ever**

Significantly, a pwBPD also uses B-W thinking when judging HIMSELF.  He therefore hates to acknowledge making a mistake because, in his mind, it would mean he is ""all bad."" He thus will blame nearly all mistakes on you and view himself as ""The Victim."" 

Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, he would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

That is, he views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to him. Hence, he views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between him and other people. He is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier person, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie for both of you."
mentalhealth,fps8l58,t3_gezi8w,1588869286.0,"Nomad, how old were you when the first episode began and how old are you now? 

Why haven't your parents made an appointment for you to speak with a psychologist so you can get a professional opinion on what you're dealing with?"
BPDlovedones,fprzcoy,t1_fpry6nq,1588864844.0,"Likewise, my exW is great with strangers. She speaks to them in such a warm and caring manner that, within 30 minutes, they feel like they've known her for quite a while and they will confide in her. She is genuinely interested in them. 

A pwBPD typically exhibits the warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability, and purity of expressions that otherwise are seen only in young children. As any parent can tell you, young children are VERY EASY to fall in love with. It thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most beloved women -- Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Princess Diana -- all had full-blown BPD if their biographers are correct.

Indeed, it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard to walk away from. Because you are essentially in a parent/child relationship, leaving is so painful because it feels like you're abandoning a young child who -- despite her frequent temper tantrums -- must dearly love and need you."
BPDlovedones,fprpith,t3_gf3ija,1588859478.0,"**Her current psychiatrist thought she didn't have BPD, based on her having good working relationships.**

Having ""good working relationships"" does not rule out BPD. On the contrary, the vast majority of people with full-blown BPD -- statistics suggest 2/3 to 3/4 of them -- are ""high functioning."" This means that they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual friends, and total strangers. 

None of those people is able to trigger the BPDer's fears of abandonment and engulfment. There is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment.

Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually appear only when someone (e.g., a casual friend) makes the mistake of drawing very close to the pwBPD. This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to excel in very difficult jobs such as being a social worker, teacher, surgeon, actor, or salesman. And this is why most pwBPD can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers -- but will go home at night to abuse the very people who love them.

Her psychiatrist very likely knows this. Perhaps he has decided, for other reasons, that she does not have full-blown BPD. Or perhaps he has decided that she does have it.

Therapists usually will not tell a high-functioning pwBPD that her primary diagnosis is BPD. Instead, they usually reveal only the names of the co-occurring clinical disorders. Therapists usually decide it is not in the patient's best interests to be told about the BPD. There are several good reasons for withholding this information. If you're interested, Uilleag, see my comment at [Loath to Diagnose BPD](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/bmlk95/the_practice_of_not_disclosing_diagnosis/emykwyu/?context=3)."
relationship_advice,fppeftt,t1_fpozcrk,1588800782.0,"YesPlease, given that your friend is already suspecting BPD, he likely is staying with her -- as I did for 15 years with my BPD exW -- because he believes he is helping her. I therefore suggest you tell him that, by staying, he likely is doing more harm than good if his GF is a pwBPD. 

One reason is that he has been destroying her opportunities to be forced to confront her own issues and learn how to manage them. That is, his enabling behavior -- i.e., often walking on eggshells to avoid triggering her rage -- has been allowing her to behave like a spoiled 4-year-old and GET AWAY WITH IT. It is important that she be allowed to suffer the logical consequences of her own bad choices and bad behavior. Otherwise she will have no incentive to learn the coping skills she never had an opportunity to learn in childhood.

Another reason he is hurting her is that he is frequently triggering her two fears as long as he remains in a close relationship with her. Until a pwBPD has had many years of therapy, whatever he does will be wrong much of the time. She will perceive him as being hurtful when he DOES something and hurtful when he DOESN'T.

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means he often finds himself in a lose/lose situation because, as he backs away from one fear to avoid triggering it, he will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

relationship_advice,fpoyesr,t3_geoar9,1588792801.0,"YesPlease, you're describing red flags for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). The behaviors you describe -- i.e., verbal abuse, controlling demands, temper tantrums, great fear of abandonment (irrational jealousy), black-white thinking, always being ""The Victim,"" and rapid flips between Jekyll (loving him) and Hyde (hating him) -- are warning signs for BPD.

Importantly, I'm not suggesting your friend's GF has full-blown BPD. Only a professional can determine that. Instead, I'm suggesting he consider whether she is exhibiting a moderate-to-strong pattern of BPD symptoms (i.e., is a ""pwBPD""). And if he gets serous about marrying or cohabiting with her, I would suggest he see psychologist -- for a visit or two by himself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what he's dealing with.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable him to diagnose his GF's issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help him avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., remaining in a toxic relationship or running into the arms of another woman just like her. Learning the red flags also can help your friend decide when professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest he take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/) to see if most sound very familiar. If so, I would suggest he read the book, *Stop Caretaking the Borderline or Narcissist.* I also would suggest he take a look at the [r/BPDlovedones]() subReddit, where he will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with (or leaving) BPD partners. 

In the right-hand column of that sub, he also will find a list of good books and links pointing to good online resources. If he has any questions about this comment, I would be glad to discuss them with him."
relationship_advice,fpo7h3c,t1_fpn9ytp,1588779705.0,"**Whenever I would read articles about manipulative or abusive relationships, I always identified some similarities.**

TW, if she is a pwBPD, she likely is very controlling but not good at manipulation. To be successful, manipulation requires careful planning and flawless execution. A pwBPD may be excellent at the planning stage but, because she lacks impulse control, she is so responsive to whatever intense feeling she is experiencing AT THIS VERY MOMENT that she screws up the ""flawless execution"" stage. 

On those rare occasions when she does try to execute her plan, you likely will see her coming from a mile away. In contrast, narcissists and sociopaths generally are masters at manipulation.

The main reason pwBPD are mistakenly thought of as ""manipulative"" is that they often make outrageous allegations and do so with a perfectly straight face. This behavior appears to constitute a bold-faced lie. What most people don't realize, however, is that the pwBPD generally is not lying. Rather, she BELIEVES the incredible claims coming out of her mouth. And a week later when she is saying the exact opposite, she very likely believes that nonsense too. 

Because a pwBPD cannot regulate her own emotions, she frequently experiences feelings so intense that she is convinced they MUST be true. Her feelings are so intense that they distort her perception of your intentions and motivations. If this behavior seems strange to you, please remember that we all do it to a lesser degree. 

The human condition is that our judgement flies out the window whenever we experience very intense feelings. This is why, by the time we were in high school, we already knew we should try to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- when we were very angry. And we knew that, when we were very infatuated, we should try to wait at least two years before buying the rings.

**The black and white thinking especially applies.**

Used in moderation, B-W thinking is a good thing and is essential to our survival. The beauty of B-W thinking is that it is quick. This is why our brains are hardwired to immediately switch to B-W thinking whenever we experience strong fear or other intense feelings. 

For example, when you are in a crosswalk and suddenly look up to see a truck bearing down on you, your mind is capable of thinking only ""jump left"" or ""jump right.""  Although B-W thinking has great survival value due to its speed, it produces disastrous results when relied on to evaluate other peoples' intentions and motivations."
relationship_advice,fpmgju6,t1_fpm7ijb,1588732598.0,"**I know it’s wrong to try and diagnose her.**

TW, you are not trying to diagnose her. Rather, you are only looking for warning signs. Before you graduated high school, you already could identify the selfish and very grandiose classmates -- without knowing how to diagnose Narcissistic PD. You could identify the class drama queen -- without being able to diagnose Histrionic PD. 

Likewise, you could spot the kids having no respect for laws or other peoples' property or feelings -- without diagnosing Antisocial PD. And you could recognize the very shy and over-sensitive classmates -- without diagnosing Avoidant PD. Similarly, you will be able to spot strong BPD traits whenever they occur. There is nothing subtle about verbal abuse, suicidal threats, and temper tantrums.

Hundreds of mental health centers list the symptoms for BPD and other disorders on their public websites to encourage the lay public to learn how to spot warning signs. They know that, when laymen are able to spot these warning signs, they are far more likely to see a professional to obtain a diagnosis. And they will do so more quickly.

**The symptoms she’s expressing are making it toxic with or without a diagnoses.**

BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

At issue, then, is not whether your W exhibits BPD traits. Of course she does. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether she exhibits those traits at a strong level (i.e., is on the upper end of the BPD spectrum). Not having met her, I cannot answer that question. I nonetheless believe you can spot any strong BPD warning signs that are present if you take a little time to learn which behaviors are on the list.

Importantly, when you are seeking a lifetime mate for marriage, it really does not matter whether a woman exhibits 80% of the diagnostic criteria (thus ""not having full-blown BPD"") or 100% (thus ""having full-blown BPD""). A person satisfying 80% of the diagnostic criteria will be nearly as impossible to live with as one exhibiting 100%.

**When upset, it’s like a switch flips and she just completely hates me.**

If your GF is a pwBPD, she is capable of loving you very intensely but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly.

Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it is unusual for a BPDer to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends.

**How should I go about breaking up with her?**

If you believe she will throw a temper tantrum and become abusive, it would be prudent to do it in a public space where you have agreed to meet -- and then walk away by yourself afterwards. If you are concerned that you won't be able to resist her attempts to talk you out of it, another option is to do it in a phone call or text.

For articles on the painful process of walking away, I recommend [Surviving a Breakup with Someone Suffering with BPD](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a109.htm) and the article, [No Contact: The Right Way](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a110.htm).

Geeky, if she is a pwBPD, it doesn't matter WHAT you say or explain. It will be impossible for you -- through sacrifices, gifts, and explanations -- to build up a store of appreciation and good will on which you could later draw during the hard times. Like a young child, a pwBPD's perception of you is fully dictated by whatever intense feeling she is experiencing AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

Hence, trying to build up a lasting store of appreciation is as futile as trying to build a lasting sandcastle on the shore beside the sea. It will be washed aside by the next tide of intense feelings flooding her mind. The result is that, even if she would accept your explanation today, it likely would have little or no effect on her perception of you next week or next month.

A pwBPD is so emotionally immature that she has an extremely weak sense of ""object constancy."" That is, she cannot trust you over time because she doesn't realize that your love, commitment, and personality are essentially constant from day to day and week to week. Indeed, she is so unstable that she cannot even trust herself. This inability to trust is a serious issue in adults because, for a friendship to be meaningful and lasting, it must be built on a foundation of trust."

Instead, I'm  suggesting  you   consider whether she may be exhibiting a  moderate-to-strong pattern of  BPD  symptoms   (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD"").

**She kicked anyone who even made her furrow her brow out of her life.** 

If  Jenny is a pwBPD, she carries  much anger inside from  early childhood.  You therefore don't have  to do a thing to CREATE  the anger.   Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor thing that  triggers a release of anger that is already  there.

This  is why a pwBPD can   burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.  Moreover,  the key  defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own  emotions. This is why *""Intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms *""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [9 Traits at BPDdemystified](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

**She has been in a psych ward to keep her from cutting/starving/killing herself.** 

The APA's diagnostic manual (DSM-5) lists *""self-injurious behavior such as cutting or hitting yourself""*  for only one disorder: BPD. That is, of the 157 disorders listed in DSM-5, only BPD has suicidal thoughts and self-harming behavior like cutting listed in its list of defining symptoms. See link above.

 **Am I in the wrong?**  

If Jenny is a pwBPD,  whatever you do  likely will be ""wrong"" much of the time. She will perceive you as  being  wrong when you DO something and wrong when you DON'T. You thus will  often find yourself in a no-win situation.

This  conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment  and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the *very same spectrum*.    This  means you often are in a lose/lose situation because,   as you   back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start     triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming her *abandonment*    fear (drawing close to comfort her and be intimate) is the very  action that   triggers her  engulfment fear.

Because that projection occurs entirely at the  subconscious   level, she  will consciously be convinced that the  painful feeling or   hurtful  thought is coming from YOU.

Hence,    as  long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you   will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e.,  triggering  her   engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her  abandonment fear as   you draw back, and triggering her anger even when  you are sitting still    in a room saying absolutely nothing.

 **She was very on-off and could switch in an instant.**

If Jenny is a pwBPD, she is capable  of loving you very  intensely but it is the very immature type of love  you see in young  children.  This means she will occasionally flip -- in   only  ten  seconds -- from Jekyll  (loving you) to Hyde (devaluing or   hating  you).  And a few hours or days later,  she can flip back again  just as  quickly.   These rapid flips arise from a childish behavior  called *""black-white thinking.""*

Like   a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able   to    handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and hate).  This     means  she   has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties,     and the  other gray areas of  close interpersonal relationships. She   thus will  subconsciously split off the conflicting  feeling,    putting  it far out of  reach of her conscious mind.

With  young children, this  ""splitting"" is  evident when the child will adore  Daddy while he's  bringing out the  toys  but, in only ten  seconds,   will flip to hating  Daddy when he  takes one  toy away. Importantly,   this behavior does  not  mean that the child has  stopped loving Daddy.    Rather, it means  that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch   with those loving feelings.

Similarly,   a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to her as  ""all  good""   (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"").   And she will  recategorize  someone from one polar extreme to the other  -- in just ten seconds --  based solely on a  minor  comment or action.

This    B-W  thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of  all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""    Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it  is  unusual  for a BPDer to have any really close *long-term* friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends.

**What should I do? Please help.** 

Of  course, Geeky, learning to spot BPD  warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose Jenny's  issues.     Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy to  spot,  only a    professional    can determine  whether they are so severe and  persistent    as to    constitute a   full-blown disorder.

Yet,  like learning  warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning  those for  BPD may  help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g.,   returning to a toxic relationship or running into the arms  of    another person just  like her.  Learning the red  flags also can  help   you  decide when  professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/)  to see if most sound very familiar.   If so and you have questions, Geeky, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
relationship_advice,fpkwtpc,t3_ge2bvt,1588702408.0,"Geeky, Jenny's abusive behavior and anger issues cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained. They may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 4 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

The first is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over your harmless comments or actions with other people -- or tried to isolate you away from close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER. Moreover, she would HATE being alone by herself.

Second, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

This B-W thinking also would manifest itself in the form of her seeing all your actions towards friends and family as a ""zero-sum game."" That is, she views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to her. 

Hence, she views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between her and other people. She is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier man, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie.

Third, most of her anger would not be directed to casual friends, classmates, and total strangers. Rather, most of her outbursts and temper tantrums would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

Fourth, you often would see Jenny flipping, on a dime, between loving you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. Such flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. Did you see strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?"

relationship_advice,fpjpn2x,t1_fpjii69,1588677154.0,"**A doctor has diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder.**

Taka, a pwBPD likely experienced a trauma before age 5 (from heredity and/or abuse or abandonment) that froze her emotional development at about age 4. This prevented her from developing a strong self image and from learning the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions.

Most cities offer treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach a pwBPD the coping skills she never had an opportunity to learn in childhood. Such a program can teach her how to do self soothing; how to regulate her own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

It also can teach her how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your personality and devotion to her are essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Sadly, it is rare for a high functioning pwBPD to have the self awareness and ego strength to remain in such a program long enough (many years) to make a real difference. Like learning to play a grand piano, it takes many years of hard practice for a pwBPD to acquire the missing coping skills.

Hence, DBT is effective only if the pwBPD is self aware and strongly motivated to work hard for years in learning these skills. As to going to a MC, my experience is that MC is totally useless until the pwBPD has had at least several years of individual therapy to address her underlying issues.

In my case, I spent a small fortune sending my exW to 6 different psychologists (and taking her to 3 MCs) for weekly sessions for 15 years. Sadly, it did not make a dent in her behavior. Not one dent.

If your GF is an untreated pwBPD, the one thing that is certain is that you will see big improvements in her behavior. Like the smoker who is always throwing away his ""last pack"" every two months, she likely will make dramatic improvements about every 6 to 8 weeks.

That's how unstable people behave. I mention this because, if you decide to put your life on hold to see if she is serious about working on her issues, it is going to be extremely difficult for you to know whether she is actually making any real, lasting improvement. Remember, even a roller coaster will be seen making dramatic gains half the time."
relationship_advice,fpicmph,t3_gdhyju,1588638166.0,"**She once broke it off with me and then ""regretted it"" the next day.**

Because her close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it is unusual for a BPDer to have any really close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends.

**It feels really smothering to always have the threat of her going mental around the corner.**

If you have been dating a pwBPD for the past year, consider yourself lucky that you're only feeling ""smothered."" Because pwBPD typically are convinced that the absurd allegations coming out of their mouths are absolutely true -- they generally have a greater ""crazy-making"" effect than can ever be achieved by narcissists or sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's diagnostic manual, BPD is the one most notorious for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their minds. Therapists typically see far more of those abused partners -- coming in to find out if they are going insane -- than they ever see of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a partner whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you. The reason is that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure out what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore her to that wonderful sweet woman you saw at the very beginning.

**She is very depressed and has self harm tendencies.**

The APA's diagnostic manual (DSM-5) lists ""self-harming behavior such as cutting"" and ""recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats"" for only one disorder: BPD. That is, of the 157 disorders listed in DSM-5, only BPD has suicidal thoughts and self-harming behavior like cutting listed in its list of defining symptoms. Nearly all pwBPD also have 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders. For example, a 2008 American study found that 80% of female pwBPD also suffer from a mood disorder such as depression and 81% suffer from an anxiety disorder.

**She also keeps distancing herself in very manipulating ways to get me to interact with her and squabble with her.**

Taka, a pwBPD typically craves intimacy like nearly all other adults. Yet, because she has a weak and unstable self image -- and has virtually no sense of personal boundaries -- she cannot tolerate intimacy for very long. When I say she has ""no sense of personal boundaries,"" I mean she has great difficulty knowing where HER feelings/problems stop and YOURS begin. She becomes so enmeshed with you that she will believe that many of her bad feelings and thoughts are originating from you.

The result is that when you two are being intimate -- or even when you're in the same room for very long -- she soon will start feeling like you somehow are suffocating or ""controlling"" her and she is losing herself in your strong personality. This is her ""fear of engulfment,"" which is equally strong to her ""fear of abandonment."" This engulfment fear explains why a pwBPD's very WORST behavior typically occurs immediately after the very BEST of times -- i.e., right after an intimate evening or great weekend or right in the middle of an expensive vacation or 3-day holiday.

**I am scared of what she will do if i leave her.**

By staying with her, Taka, you may be doing more harm than good. One reason is that, whenever you start walking on eggshells to avoid triggering her anger, you are destroying her opportunities to be forced to confront her own issues and learn how to manage them. 

That is, your enabling behavior is allowing her to behave like a spoiled 4-year-old and GET AWAY WITH IT. It is important that she be allowed to suffer the logical consequences of her own bad choices and bad behavior. Otherwise she will have no incentive to learn the coping skills she never had an opportunity to learn in childhood.

Another reason you are doing harm is that you are triggering her two fears as long as you remain in a close relationship with her. Until she has had many years of therapy in a program such as DBT, whatever you do likely will be hurtful much of the time. She will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T. This frequently puts you in a no-win situation.

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.

Hence, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.

In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.

**Most days shes really nice and loving.**

Taka, a pwBPD typically exhibits the warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability, and purity of expressions that otherwise are seen only in young children. As any parent can tell you, young children are VERY EASY to fall in love with. It thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most beloved women -- Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Princess Diana -- all had full-blown BPD if their biographers are correct.

Indeed, it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard to walk away from. Because you are essentially in a parent/child relationship, leaving is so painful because it feels like you're abandoning a young child who -- despite her frequent temper tantrums -- must dearly love and need you.

**I honestly don't know what to do.**

Taka, if you ever feel tempted to marry or cohabit with this young lady, I would suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you and your future children will be dealing with. Conversely, if you decide to walk away, doing so will be painful. I therefore would recommend you read [Surviving a Breakup with Someone Suffering with BPD](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a109.htm) and the article, [No Contact: The Right Way](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a110.htm). 

I also suggest you take a look at the [r/BPDlovedones](https://old.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/) subReddit, where you will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with (and walking away from) BPD partners. In the right-hand column of that sub, you also will find a list of good books and links pointing to good online resources.

**I'm feeling so confused and lost.**

Shannon, if you dated a pwBPD for a year, consider yourself lucky that you are only feeling ""confused and lost."" A large share of the abused partners become so utterly confused that they feel like they are losing their minds. Because pwBPD typically are convinced that the absurd allegations coming out of their mouths are absolutely true -- they generally have a greater ""crazy-making"" effect than can ever be achieved by narcissists or sociopaths.

**I was walking on eggshells 24/7.**

This enabling behavior is harmful to both of you. It is harmful to her because it is important she be allowed to suffer the logical consequences of her own bad behavior and bad choices. Otherwise, you are destroying the incentives she has to confront her own issues and seek therapy.

It is harmful to you because, by not behaving like your true self, you were starting to lose touch with your true personality. As you say, ""I felt like I had lost my self identity."" This toxic situation is why the best-selling BPD book (published in 8 languages and targeted to the abused partners) is titled Stop Walking on Eggshells.


**She could blow up and be so mean for hours. Then drop it as if nothing happened.**

If your exGF is a pwBPD, Shannon, she is capable of loving you very intensely but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly.

Spikey, with an untreated pwBPD, it is impossible for you -- through sacrifices and gifts -- to build up a store of appreciation and good will on which you could later draw during the hard times. Like a young child, a pwBPD's perception of you is fully dictated by whatever intense feeling she is experiencing AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

Hence, trying to build up a lasting store of appreciation is as futile as trying to build a lasting sandcastle on the shore beside the sea. It will be washed aside by the next tide of intense feelings flooding her mind.

In my case, I spent a fortune sending my exW to 6 different psychologists (and taking her to 3 MCs) for weekly sessions for 15 years. Sadly, it did not make a dent in her behavior. Not one dent.

If your exGF is an untreated pwBPD, the one thing that is certain is that you will see big improvements in her behavior. Like the smoker who is always throwing away his ""last pack"" every two months, she likely will make dramatic improvements about every 6 to 8 weeks. That's how unstable people behave. 

I mention this because, if you decide to put your life on hold to see if she is serious about working on her issues, it is going to be extremely difficult for you to know whether she is actually making any real, lasting improvement. Remember, even a roller coaster will be seen making dramatic gains half the time."

No, if he is a pwBPD, he abuses you because you are the only person who has moved so close that you are able to trigger his two fears.  The vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning.""  This means that they typically  hold   jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, clients, casual    friends, and total strangers.  

None of  those people is able to  trigger  the BPDer's fears of abandonment and  engulfment.  There is no  close  relationship that can be abandoned and no  intimacy to trigger  the  suffocating feeling of engulfment.  Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually   appear only  when someone (e.g., a casual friend) makes the mistake of drawing close  to the pwBPD.  

This is why it is common for high   functioning pwBPD to  excel in very difficult jobs such as being a   social worker, teacher,  surgeon, professional actor, or salesman.  And   this is why most pwBPD  can be considerate and friendly all day long to   complete strangers --  but will go home at night to abuse the very  people who love them. 

**He always faults me for everything I do... he makes me feel completely wrong.**

This occurs, Fan, because you ARE completely wrong -- if he is a pwBPD. You are wrong when you DO something and wrong when you DON'T.   You are in a no-win situation because you cannot avoid triggering his two fears no matter what you do.

This  conundrum is due to the position of his two fears -- abandonment  and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the *very same spectrum*.    This  means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because,    as you  back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will  start    triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your  predicament is that the solution to calming his *abandonment*   fear  (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that   triggers his engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming his  *engulfment fear*   (moving back away to give him breathing space) is the  very action that   triggers his abandonment fear.

Hence,  as   you move close to comfort him and assure him of your  love, you    eventually will start triggering his engulfment fear, making  him feel    like he's being suffocated and controlled by you. (Although he craves intimacy like other adults do, he is too emotionally immature to handle it for very long.) Yet, as  you back  away   to give him breathing space, you will find that you've  started    triggering his abandonment fear.

In  my 15  years with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints     solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can   safely   stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns   how to   better regulate his own emotions and tame his two fears, that    Goldilocks  position will not exist. This is why a relationship with  an   untreated  pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away  and pull-you-back.

Indeed,   even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a  word, a  pwBPD  who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those  feelings  onto  YOU. His subconscious does this to protect his fragile  ego from  seeing  too much  of reality -- and to externalize the pain,  getting it  outside his body.  Because that projection occurs entirely at  the  subconscious  level, he  will consciously be convinced that the  painful  feeling or  hurtful  thought is coming from YOU.

Hence,   as  long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated  pwBPD  having  strong  symptoms, you will often find yourself hurting him  --  i.e.,  triggering  his engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering  his   abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering his anger even  when   you are sitting still  in a room saying absolutely nothing.

**What should I do?  Should I wait it out?**

Given  that you still feel tempted to return to him, I suggest you see a   psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid   professional opinion on what you're dealing with.  Whenever strong BPD   warning signs are appearing, it is important to see YOUR OWN   psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated your BF.

In that way, you're   ensured that the psych is ethically bound to protect YOUR best   interests, not his.  I mention this because therapists   generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD (or tell his GF) the name of his   disorder.  They often decide that it is not in his best interests to be   told.

Of  course,  learning to   spot BPD warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose his  issues.      Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy to  spot,  only a      professional   can determine  whether they are so severe and  persistent      as to   constitute a   full-blown disorder.

Yet,   like learning  warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning   those for  BPD may  help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g.,    remaining  in a toxic relationship or running into the arms  of     another man  just  like him.  Learning the red  flags also can  help    you  decide when  professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/)  to see if most sound very familiar.   If so and you have questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you."
relationship_advice,fpe10xv,t1_fpdfe6e,1588538219.0,"Fan,  the abandonment fear and 3 other behaviors described above   are red flags for  BPD  (Borderline  Personality Disorder).    Importantly, I'm not  suggesting your BF has full-blown BPD.  Only a   professional can  determine that.  Instead, I'm  suggesting  you    consider whether he may be exhibiting a  strong pattern of  BPD   symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD"").

 **He would get unreasonably angry.**

If   your BF is a pwBPD, he carries  enormous anger inside from   early childhood. You therefore don't have  to do a thing to CREATE  the  anger.   Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor thing that   triggers a release of anger that is already  there.  This is why a   pwBPD can   burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.  Moreover, the key defining   characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions.

**He hit me once (a slap across the face) and, later on  that year, he  backhanded me -- giving me a black eye.** 

More than 30 empirical studies have found the *physical* abuse  of a spouse or partner to be strongly     associated with  BPD.  One of the first   studies showing that link is a     1993 hospital  study of spousal   batterers.  It found that nearly     all  of them have a personality    disorder and half have BPD. See  Roger Melton's summary at [50% of Batterers Have BPD](http://www.sott.net/articles/show/149774-Romeo-s-Bleeding-When-Mr-Right-Turns-Out-To-Be-Mr-Wrong).

This is why *""Intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms *""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [9 Traits at BPDdemystified](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

**He was always hot and cold. One day he loved me. The next day he threatened to leave me again.** 

If   your BF is a pwBPD, he is capable  of loving you very intensely but it   is the very immature type of love  you see in young children.  This   means he will occasionally flip -- in   only  ten seconds -- from   Jekyll  (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or   hating you). And a few   hours or days later,  he can flip back again  just as quickly.  As you say, *""He was always hot and cold.""* These   rapid flips arise from a childish behavior  called *""black-white thinking.""*

Like    a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able   to     handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and hate).  This      means  he   has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties,      and the  other gray areas of  close interpersonal relationships. He thus will  subconsciously split off the conflicting  feeling,     putting  it far out of  reach of his conscious mind.

With  young  children, this  ""splitting"" is  evident when the child will  adore Mommy  while she's  bringing out the  toys  but, in only ten   seconds,  will  flip to hating  Mommy when she  takes one  toy away.  Importantly,   this behavior does  not  mean that the child has  stopped  loving  Mommy.   Rather, it means  that his conscious mind is  temporarily out of  touch  with those loving feelings.

Similarly,    a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to him as  ""all  good""    (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"").   And he will  recategorize   someone from one polar extreme to the other  -- in just ten seconds --   based solely on a  minor  comment or action.

This     B-W  thinking also will be evident in his frequent use of   all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""     Because his close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it  is   unusual  for a BPDer to have any really close *long-term* friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though he may have many casual friends.

**I have no idea if I can talk to him ever again bar work, or if this is the ""final"" breakup.** 

BPD relationships are notorious for having multiple breakups. A  BPDfamily survey of 600 such relationships found that 21% went through  10 or more complete breakup/makeup cycles BEFORE finally ending for  good. About 40% of them experienced at least six full breakup/makeup  cycles before ending. And 73% had three or more breakup/makeup cycles  before finally ending. See ""Results"" at [BPDfamily Breakup/Makeup Poll](http://bpdfamily.com/message_board/index.php?PHPSESSID=61cfea90d5baeaffa15c7f867e2bb854&topic=120215). 

 **I'm just so depressed over this I have no idea what to do.**

If   you have been dating a pwBPD for 4 years, consider yourself lucky to be feeling only *""depressed and confused.""* A large share of the abused partners become so utterly confused that they feel like they may be going crazy.  Because pwBPD  typically are convinced  that the  absurd allegations  coming out of  their mouths are absolutely  true --  they generally have a  greater  ""crazy-making""  effect than can  ever be  achieved by  narcissists or  sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's  diagnostic manual, BPD is the *one most notorious*    for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their    minds.  Therapists typically see far more of those  abused partners --   coming in to find out if they are going insane --  than they ever see    of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing    will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a partner    whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you.  The  reason  is    that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure  out   what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore him  to that  wonderful  sweet   man you saw at the very beginning."
relationship_advice,fpdbxjk,t3_gct3wd,1588523961.0,"Fan, you're describing an abusive BF who seems to have a strong abandonment fear. That would explain why, a few months into your relationship, he started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- and has tried to isolate you away from your close friends and family members. He would view your spending time with your friends/family as your choosing THEM over HIM.

This strong abandonment fear -- as well as his abusive and controlling behaviors -- may be due to his having very weak control over his own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 3 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

First, you would be seeing him rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein he categorizes everyone as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because he also uses B-W thinking when judging HIMSELF, he hates to acknowledge making a mistake.

To him, it would mean he is ""all bad."" He thus would blame nearly all mistakes on you and view himself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, he would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

This B-W thinking also would manifest itself in the form of his seeing all your actions towards friends and family as a ""zero-sum game."" That is, he views all the love, gifts, money, and time you give to friends/family as a GAIN to them that is exactly matched with a LOSS to him. Hence, he views your love and generosity as a fixed-size pie that is to be split between him and other people. He is too immature to understand that, because those behaviors enrich your life and make you a healthier person, they actually serve to INCREASE the size of that pie for both of you.

Second, you would rarely (if ever) see him expressing his rages to casual friends, coworkers, and total strangers. Rather, his temper tantrums almost exclusively would be directed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or his parents).

Third, you often would see him flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on eggshells. These flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. And a few hours or a week later, he could flip back just as quickly.

My experience is that no more than 1% of high functioning pwBPD have those two essential capabilities. You are one of those rare individuals.

As you know far better than I do, learning the techniques taught in DBT/CBT is the EASY part. What is HARD is practicing them daily for years so that those coping skills become immediately available when you need them and feel natural and appropriate.

See [9 Traits at BPDdemystified](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

**He suffered a lot of abandonment and abuse from his parents.**

Another one of the 9 BPD symptoms is ""Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment."" When a child experiences strong trauma before age 5 (from heredity and/or abuse or abandonment), it can freeze the child's emotional development at the level of a 4 year old. 

When this happens, it prevents the child from learning the many coping skills needed to control his own emotions and to form an integrated, strong, self identity. Most cities offer weekly training programs (e.g., DBT and CBT) that can teach a pwBPD those missing skills.

**He sees things more black and white than me.**

If your H is a pwBPD, he is capable of loving you very intensely but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means he will occasionally flip -- in only ten seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, he can flip back again just as quickly.

**I am not saying he is lying or manipulating... Just that he sees things differently.**

If your H were a narcissist or sociopath, his false claims would be lies and manipulation. If he is a pwBPD, however, he very likely BELIEVES the absurd allegations coming out of his mouth. Because a pwBPD cannot control his emotions, he frequently experiences feelings so intense that they distort his perception of your intentions and motivations. Moreover, the feeling is so intense that he is convinced it somehow MUST be true even if he has trouble explaining it.

**I want us to go to therapy together.**

If your H is a pwBPD, going to couples counseling likely will be a waste of time until he has had years of individual treatment to learn the emotional skills he never had an opportunity to learn in childhood. Hence, I suggest you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see YOUR OWN psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated him.

If your psych decides that it sounds like your H likely is exhibiting strong BPD traits, he/she can refer your H to a second psychologist who is very experienced in treating BPD. On the other hand, if your psych decides that your H is exhibiting only mild BPD traits, he/she may refer you both to a couples counselor.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose his issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Indeed, it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard to walk away from.

relationship_advice,fp7glz0,t3_gbmj1s,1588370244.0,"**I believe she suffers from a bipolar disorder.**

Perhaps so, Epic. That is not what you're describing here, however. Rather, you seem to be describing warning signs for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Significantly, bipolar mood changes arise from gradual chemical changes in the body. They therefore typically take a week to develop and usually will last from a week to several months and will occur only once or twice a year.

In contrast, a BPD mood flip typically occurs in ten seconds in response to some minor thing that trigger's the person's two fears (abandonment and engulfment). A BPD mood change -- a temper tantrum actually -- typically lasts for only a few hours (rarely as long as 18 hours).

The distinction between these two disorders is very important. Whereas bipolar is caused by a change in body chemistry, BPD is believed to be caused by something occurring before age 5 (heredity and/or a childhood trauma) that prevents the child from acquiring the coping skills needed to regulate her own emotions and establish a strong, stable self identity. As you observe, *""Her mother has been emotionally abusive her entire life.""*

Hence, whereas bipolar oftentimes can be treated quite successfully by swallowing a pill, BPD can only by treated by years of hard work -- in a weekly therapy program such as DBT -- to acquire those missing coping skills. Like learning to play a piano, learning those skills takes many years of practice and strong commitment.

Of course, learning to spot BPD warning signs will not enable you to diagnose her issues. Although strong BPD symptoms are easy to spot, only a professional can determine whether they are so severe and persistent as to constitute a full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning those for BPD may help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., by helping you leave a toxic relationship and avoid running into the arms of another woman just like her. It also may help you decide when professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you familiarize yourself with the warning signs (i.e., symptoms) for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Specifically, I suggest you take a quick look at my discussions in [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/) and in [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/).

SHORT ANSWER: If she is an untreated pwBPD, you are dating an intelligent and educated woman having the emotional development of a 4 year old. At 18 years of age, you should be dating mature adults so you are able to acquire the experience necessary to be a good husband when you eventually decide to settle down in your late twenties. I suggest you immediately contact the university and change your living arrangements this Fall in the dorm. As noted above, a pwBPD's abusive behavior gets far worse as you get closer and more intimate with her because she can tolerate emotional closeness only for very short periods at a time.

LONG ANSWER: If your therapist agrees with your suspicion that you're dating a person with many strong BPD traits, it would be unwise to tell your GF about BPD. If she is a pwBPD, she almost certainly would project the accusation back onto you. Because that projection occurs at the subconscious level, she would be convinced that YOU are the pwBPD. 

Instead of telling her about BPD, simply suggest she see a psychologist to get help for her depression and unhappiness.  Most cities offer treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, or CBT) that can teach a pwBPD the coping skills she never had an opportunity to learn in childhood. Such a program can teach her how to do self soothing; how to regulate her own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

It also can teach her how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your personality and devotion to her are essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Sadly, it is rare for a high functioning pwBPD to have the self awareness and ego strength to remain in such a program long enough (many years) to make a real difference. Like learning to play a grand piano, it takes many years of hard practice for a pwBPD to acquire the missing coping skills.

Hence, DBT is effective only if the pwBPD is self aware and strongly motivated to work hard for years in learning these skills. My experience is that no more than 1% of high functioning pwBPD have those two essential strengths. 

It therefore is very rare for a high functioning to seek out therapy and stay in it long enough (many years) to acquire the missing coping skills needed to control her own emotions. As to going to couples counseling, my experience is that it is totally useless until the pwBPD has had at least several years of individual therapy to address her underlying issues.

In my case, I spent a small fortune sending my exW to 6 different psychologists (and taking her to 3 MCs) for weekly sessions. I did that for 15 years. Sadly, it did not make a dent in her behavior. Not one dent.

If your GF is an untreated pwBPD, the one thing that is certain is that you will see big improvements in her behavior. Like the smoker who is always throwing away his ""last pack"" every two months, she likely will make dramatic improvements about every 6 to 8 weeks. That's how unstable people behave. 

I mention this because, if you decide to put your life on hold for 5 years to see if your GF is serious about working on her issues, it is going to be extremely difficult for you to know whether she is actually making any real, lasting improvement. Remember, even a roller coaster will be seen making dramatic gains half the time.

Once you start living with a pwBPD, whatever you do likely will be wrong much of the time. She will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T.

This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.

Hence, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.

In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto YOU. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from YOU.

Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you will often find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still in a room saying absolutely nothing."

relationship_advice,fp4lneu,t1_fp49w6c,1588301773.0,"20M, the abandonment fear and 3 other behaviors described above  are red  flags for  BPD  (Borderline  Personality Disorder).   Importantly, I'm  not  suggesting your GF has full-blown BPD.  Only a  professional can   determine that.  Instead, I'm  suggesting  you   consider whether she  may be exhibiting a  moderate-to-strong pattern of  BPD  symptoms    (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD"").

 **I have been 100% seeing 1 and 3. As for 2, I’ve seen her take some anger out on her mom, but never any friends or coworkers.**

Actually, you are describing sign #2 too.  It states, *""Second, you would NOT see her expressing her anger to casual friends,  coworkers, or total strangers. Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums  almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e.,  against YOU or her parents).""* 

**She just liked fucking with my feelings when she’d be upset.**

If  your GF actually is a pwBPD, she carries much anger inside  from  early childhood. You therefore don't have  to do a thing to  CREATE  the anger.   Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor  thing that  triggers a release of anger that is already  there. This  is why a pwBPD can   burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.   

Moreover,  pwBPD have very weak control over their emotions.  Indeed,  the key  defining characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate  one's own  emotions. This is why *""Intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms *""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [**9 BPD Traits**](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

 **She definitely has always had black and white thinking.** 

If  your GF is a pwBPD, she is capable  of loving you  very intensely but it  is the very immature type of love  you see in  young children.  This  means she will occasionally flip -- in   only   ten seconds -- from  Jekyll  (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or    hating you).  And a few  hours or days later,  she can flip back again   just as quickly. This childish behavior is called ""black-white thinking.""

Like   a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to  simultaneously handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and  hate).  This     means  she   has great difficulty tolerating  ambiguities, uncertainties,     and the  other gray areas of  close  interpersonal relationships. She   thus will  subconsciously split off  the conflicting  feeling,    putting  it far out of  reach of her  conscious mind.

With  young children, this  ""splitting"" is  evident when the child  will adore  Daddy while he's  bringing out the  toys  but, in only ten   seconds,   will flip to hating  Daddy when he  takes one  toy away.  Importantly,   this behavior does  not  mean that the child has  stopped  loving Daddy.    Rather, it means  that her conscious mind is  temporarily out of touch   with those loving feelings. In that way, the  child only has to deal with one strong feeling at a time.

Similarly,   a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to her as  ""all   good""   (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"").   And she will   recategorize  someone from one polar extreme to the other  -- in just  ten seconds --  based solely on a  minor  comment or action. This    B-W  thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of   all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS...."" 

 **I feel like I’m going to break down.**

If  you have been dating a pwBPD for a year, that is exactly how you should be feeling. A large share of the abused partners become so utterly confused they  feel like they may be going crazy. Because pwBPD typically are convinced   that the  absurd allegations  coming out of their mouths are  absolutely  true --  they generally have a  greater ""crazy-making""   effect than can  ever be  achieved by  narcissists or sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's  diagnostic manual, BPD is the *one most notorious*    for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their    minds.  Therapists typically see far more of those  abused partners --   coming in to find out if they are going insane --  than they ever see    of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing   will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused  by a partner   whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you.  The   reason  is   that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you  can figure out   what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore her  to that   wonderful sweet   woman you saw at the very beginning.

**I feel tempted to contact her.** 

If she is a pwBPD, it likely will be extremely painful for you to stay away. A pwBPD typically exhibits the   warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability,  and purity of  expressions that   otherwise are seen only in young children. As  any  parent can tell you,  young children are VERY EASY to fall  in love  with.

It  thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most  beloved  women  --  Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Princess Diana -- all had  full-blown  BPD  if  their biographers are correct.

Indeed, it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard  to  walk   away from. Because you are essentially in a parent/child    relationship,  leaving is so painful because it feels like you're    abandoning a young  child who -- despite her frequent temper tantrums --    must dearly love  and need you.

**I've never seen her take anger out on any friends or coworkers.**

The  vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning"" -- i.e., they  typically   hold   jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers,  clients, casual     friends, and total strangers.  None of  those people  is able to   trigger  the BPDer's fears of abandonment and  engulfment.   There is no   close  relationship that can be abandoned and no   intimacy to trigger   the  suffocating feeling of engulfment.

Hence,  with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually   appear  only  when  someone makes the mistake of drawing very close  to the  pwBPD.  This is  why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to  excel  in very difficult  jobs such as being a social worker, nurse, teacher,  surgeon, actor, or  salesman.  And   this is why most pwBPD  can be  considerate and friendly  all day long to   complete strangers --  but  will go home at night to  abuse the very  people who love them.

 **She has bipolar disorder.**

Perhaps so, M20. That is not what you're describing here, however.  Bipolar mood changes arise from gradual chemical changes in the body.   They therefore typically take a week to develop and usually will last   from a week to several months and will occur only once or twice a year.

 **It’s so so fucking hard to ignore her.** 

20M, if you ever feel tempted to take her back, I would urge you to see  a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by  yourself -- to obtain a  candid professional opinion on what you're  dealing with. Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see  YOUR OWN psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated her.  In that way,  you're ensured that the psych is ethically bound to protect YOUR best  interests, not hers.  

Of  course,  learning to spot BPD  warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose her   issues.     Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy to  spot,  only a    professional    can determine  whether they are so severe and  persistent    as to    constitute a   full-blown disorder.

relationship_advice,fp48zen,t3_gb7zzp,1588294087.0,"20M, you're describing abusive and controlling behavior that cannot be excused but perhaps can be explained. You're describing a GF who seems to have a very strong abandonment fear. Such a fear would explain why, a few months into your 1-year relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events -- and started showing she is incapable of trusting you. She also has been trying to isolate you away from your close friends and family members. She would view your spending time with your friends/family as your choosing THEM over HER.

This strong abandonment fear -- as well as her abusive and controlling behaviors -- may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an issue, however, you should be seeing 3 other warning signs you have not mentioned.

First, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" and will recategorize someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction. Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw.

Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER...."" Further, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you.

Second, you would not see her expressing her anger to casual friends, coworkers, or total strangers. Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e., against YOU or her parents).

**She had many past physically and emotionally abusive relationships causing her to have severe trust issues and anxiety.** 

Bones, if your GF actually suffers from lifetime BPD, it likely resulted from a childhood trauma (from heredity and/or abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. Because the trauma froze her emotional development at age 4, she never learned the many coping skills needed to control her own emotions.
