bipolar,fkuz0p2,t3_fkrp85,1584558804.0,"So... I'm going a little dark here.... if that's an issue, I'd probably not read this.

Since pretty much the inception of man, people who suffer from our conditions (mental health issues) have been stigmatized, although that is the least of the issues we have had to deal with.

We have been stoned, burned at the stake, beaten, held captive, lobotomized, over medicated, flat out drugged into submission, locked in chains... and all while the ""helpers"" or ""caretakers"" of our community used us as guinea pigs for their personal experiments, or raped us, or stole from us.... They tried to breed us out of existence with eugenics, or euthanize us.... 

People fear mental illness. They don't know what causes it. They don't understand how to fix it, or cure it, and it terrifies them that they might somehow contract it. It is that lack of understanding that often times screws them in the end.... because of this ""that could never happen to me"" attitude.... so they fail to understand that mental illness also encompasses environmental triggers... which happen to everyone.

The simple fact is, you have to be careful who you talk to about your illness, if you are trying to survive in the ""normal"" world. 

It all sounds so dark, and dreary, right?

It's not that bad. Bear with me.

Because we live in an information age, with sites like reddit... we can find each other. We can support each other. Real actual people, who have suffered through what we have.... and survived.... and give each other support, and tips on how to make it through the rough times.

Yeah, normal people suck. But that's been true since humanity began. And yeah, we have been persecuted for the entire length of human history (ironically, the only group, I think, that has been consistently taken advantage of, by every civilization, and I shudder to think about the numbers of us that have been slaughtered and lost to history for simply existing, and yet nobody ever talks about that aspect of it. Nope, its just to point out how violent we are....)

The simple fact is... ""normal"" people... and society... are fucking brutal... far more violent, and oppressive than anyone who is mentally ill could ever be. Most of us are too busy self isolating and just trying to make it through the day to want to hurt people.... but ""normal"" people have this narrative.... they like to feel superior to others, and thus they cherry pick information that fits into their myopic viewpoints. Some of the worst offenders are the ""caregivers"".

Not all of them. Not even a statistically large number of them. Just enough though, to make it hard to trust them.

So yeah, when people ask me why I don't trust people..... it's because they are ""normal"". And if living on earth for 40 plus years has taught me anything.... ""normal"" people are dangerous.

Just be careful. And let the idiots be idiots."

The biggest problem, I think, that a lot of folks with bipolar disorder have,  is adjusting to what ""normal"" is. 

Also, I would suggest that based on having come out of a relationship, probably effects your sex drive. From what I have been told, sex is generally a by product of relationships... though often times, at younger ages we seem to base relationships off of sex. (which is probably a reason why it fails so often.)

At any rate, I wouldn't stress too much about it. I take lamotrigine and it doesn't effect my sex drive. The citalopram on the other hand, shoots it directly in the head. Even if I had any interest in sex, I can't even have an orgasm. Trust me, it sucks.

Have been since I was 17. I struggled, every day. Anger, frustration, hatred, a temper that at times was on a hair trigger, and then the guilt after I blew up.... just made me want to never be near anyone again, so I didn't hurt them.

A part of me wanted to be dead. I mean, it was an end to the nightmare.... but I am... terrified of dying. I mean, awake at night, can't sleep, with this never ending dread of dying.  There was only one time I ever truly wanted to die, and the feeling came so fast, and so intense that it scared me straight back into sanity. (briefly.)

I only ever found one thing that helped. That was medication. I could talk till I was blue in the face, and while it helped me gain understanding into my own behavior and taught me how to keep a tight control on my anger (most of the time.), it didn't change anything on the inside of me.

My exhaustion came from having a constant iron grip on my self. Constantly being vigilant about my own behavior, and biting my tongue... not allowing the nastiness to come out, and a constant battle with insomnia.... sometimes lasting for more than two or three days.

Once I found the right meds, I didn't have to do that anymore.

1. Game release: Honeymoon phase. (unless the game is bad.. like Anthem). Everyone puts out glowing posts, praising the game. They can't get enough of it, it's revolutionary, and will bring world peace.
2. 1-4 Weeks Later: Beer goggles come off. Turns out, the game needs tweaking. People realize the game isn't perfect, and the pendulum swings. Tons of fix this nao! posts start to circulate and the hate train warms up.
3. 3-8 weeks later: Hung over and grumpy AF.  Bugs that are persistent create huge rifts in the community. Developers bunker down and try to weather the insult barrage. (its not that a majority of the community is doing it, its just enough and loud enough that they tend to get the focus.) Lines are drawn, sides are taken. The war begins.
4. 6-12 weeks later: FOR THE HORDE! Hardcore fanboys and Seriously pissed off gamers (or trolls, or dicks, or whatever) begin the war in earnest. It can be a short lived war or a 100 years war. Developers go dark, and generally button up. Any communication from them is scrutinized, placed under a microscope and god help them if they set an estimated time for something and miss it. (to be fair, some developers just drop the ball continuously... but still, it can get seriously vicious at this point.) The fight will continue over every patch and every change... ranging from glowingly positive to personal insults hurled at developers and fans.
5. 32-64 weeks: Attrition occurs, people haunt the forums, Skirmish battles are fought, and the war quiets for a bit. New content generally gets released at some point in this window. They hype train starts, some hail it as the savior of the game, others as cynical cash grabs.

And then the cycle begins again.

It happens in every game subreddit. The bottom line, is the people who like the game, play the game. The people who, don't move on. Reddit is a small slice of the game player base that tend to be really vocal one way or the other.

The first thing, you should be stable. Bear in mind neurotypical people are oft times way more unstable than someone with bp. But you have to be diligent about monitoring your moods, compensating for them, and having the courage to ask for help.

Secondly, it is challenging. Newborns require feedings about every 2 hours. Day and night... about the same for changes.

What they dont tell you, is that a child's cry is specifically designed to... well get your attention. It can grate on your nerves, and lack of sleep can fray your temper. You will get angry. Very angry. That's not abnormal. Caretaking can be wholly overwhelming. It's ok to step back for a sec and take deep breaths.

Third as they get older the challenges change from physical constant care to vigilance and behavior. They will test your patience, their boundaries, and often times the laws of physics. 

It requires gentle guidance, patience, and being aware of what they are getting into. And I promise, the quieter it gets, the more trouble you're in. 😉

Fourth and last is the pregnancy itself. Your body goes nuts with hormones, and some meds are incompatible with preggers. That doesn't mean you're sol. It just means finding the right med/s to help.

I know this seems discouraging.... but it's not designed to be. It gives you a place to start in how you discuss this with your partner and doctor. It can be done, but go in with your eyes open and plans for you and your spouse to handle. Kids are at the very least a team effort.

After that, its like every three months. If you wind up with kidney toxicity, they take you off of it, put you on something else, or try a lower level. If you actually have kidney damage, then you need to see a Nephrologist to determine the scope of the damage, and they will have to work up a treatment plan.

Basically, if you think you are having kidney issues, you need to see your doctor. Now would be better than later."

I was at a birthday party, so I ate 2 ... what I thought were 5mg (turned out they were 10s, and Im a moron.).... I took them about 2 hours or so before we went, so they kicked in full force as soon as I got in the car.

I sat on the couch and stared at her 50 gallon fish tank for what felt like hours, turns out it was about 3 minutes. Spent the rest of the day convinced everyone knew I was stoned, and that this really hadn't worked out how I planned it. 

Moral of the story, always check the dosage on the labels, on the back of your packages.

If I take it without being current on my meds, nothing at all happens. I have no idea why."

The only thing taxes do is shift money from one group to another. For the last two decades the tax burden has been on the middle class, which has been decimated. Taxes like the grocery tax, keep piling the tax burden on those people, as well as the poor....

Meanwhile, corporations have enjoyed a decrease in tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, while the top corporations are actually paying 11 percent, with about 60 of them paying an effective 0 percent tax or lower. Meanwhile the unemployment rate was about 3.8 percent, and the underemployment rate was about 12.5 percent.

Meanwhile, Trumps tax plan decreases taxes on people making 415k + a year by 7%.

Basically, my country is a hot mess. Has been for a while... like decades... and its just getting worse.

Shifting to far in one direction or another produces significant and severe push back, thus stalling the desired outcome and leading to a deadlock that prohibits any forward progress on any issue, not just the one that generated the push back.

At least, that's what centrism is to me.

Aka: Hate politics."
