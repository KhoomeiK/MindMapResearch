Even if you don't make much profit from selling it, you've earned the self-respect you get from knowing you accomplished something less than 0.1% of the population could ever do! 

   No successful person's rise to success is a straight-up trajectory. Stephen King threw his first manuscript into the trash, Wiston Churchill was rejected from his dream school three times, and Theodore Roosevelt and Elon Musk were bullied as children, yet they overcame. Even F. Scott Fitzgerald dropped out of Princeton and was drafted into the Army; worried he wouldn't survive WWI, he quickly wrote ""The Romantic Egotist"", which the publisher rejected but encouraged him to submit more work like it to them in the future. 

   It seems like all of life is a challenge, or one long ""negotiation"" as I read from some FBI negotiator. I believe it's one of our purposes to encounter these challenges and develop through them, becoming stronger, better versions of ourselves in the end. ""True gold does not fear the test of fire."" 

   And even similarly, like a character in a novel, you might just be somewhere in your Act II, near the revelation and just about to hit the comeback to rocket through Act III faster and stronger than ever! Jeff Bezos only started Amazon when he was 30, so it appears  this next year is scheduled for you to become the greatest being you were meant to be!

   We're all in the same zodiac boat with COVID-19, but we'll find land again someday. Could I ask you to come up with a couple ideas of how you can get through these tough times, and share them with us on this post so we can brainstorm and strategize with you? I think we'd really like that, brother / sister."
