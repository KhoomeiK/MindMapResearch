anime,fr4oyyc,t1_fr4o6yn,1589893834.0,"I mean you’re absolutely right. But I do think it’s a bit of both. He isn’t entirely at the mercy of his self destructive personality, he does have agency, but he needs others to help him along the way. It takes a slap in the face or two for him to “wake up”, and when he does he shines. Without Yukino and Yui he’d likely fall deeper into resentment, but with their help he turns tables on his personal flaws and makes something constructive of them. Then in the second season I feel it turns into an actual romance story where he faces the consequences of his newfound ability to interact socially and seek more intimate relationships."
anime,fr4lmqy,t1_fr4kj7u,1589891585.0,"Yeah, if he did it would mean his thinking was mature, but it isn’t. It’s totally consistent with the sort of thinking you’d find in a lonely teenage guy who thinks highly of himself, but also paradoxically doesn’t. I think that’s why the writing in this show is really good and compelling. It’s the annoying realism of it, as far as his monologues go. It’s juvenile, but it isn’t one dimensional. If you think of your token “lonely” character in most anime they’re either mocked for comedic relief by the writers (like Yunyun from Konosuba) or they’re walking blank slates tagged “always alone” with a sort of faux baggage they’re ready to throw away and integrate into the MC’s inner circle the moment they meet (basically every lone wolf character that isn’t the protagonist). Alternatively, if it isn’t a side character, the loneliness is merely a footnote in the first episode where it’s immediately replaced by something more interesting. It amounts to the same thing either way. Otherwise a truly lonely MC is hard to find, because storytelling is easier when you can progress the plot with pre-existing friendships. Without those, you’re stuck with a monologuing “hero”, resting bitch face a bonus if anything."

It’s exactly as you say, I desire connection but it’s like a really difficult math problem for me. I kind of get the idea but I just can’t seem to get it fully. 

And yeah, wow, I’ve had a similar experience with people suffering. An uncle of mine of was being wasted away slowly by cancer. I could see how everyone around him didn’t want to feel the tragedy of it. For me, I was perfectly comfortable with it, I felt I could be there for him in a way no one else could be. Detached from the twisted injustice of it all, his pain, yet able to be present for him in a way that went beyond just empathy, which would get in the way. I felt nothing, yet I felt compelled to do something to help anyway.

I should perhaps disclaim the asshollery factor more. I’ve gotten so good at acting “normal” most of the time, it’s really confusing for people when that breaks down for whatever reason. It’s all just so mechanical and systematic for me. Is it like that for you? I gather information which amounts to cause and effect and I use it to fit in the best I can. All the way down to body language and facial expressions and particular words I use. I’ve been mimicking people I see do well socially a lot throughout my life and it works alright. But eventually there’s always something missing which makes people recoil. Or I make some kind of mistake.


I’m going to completely word for word say what you’ve suggested. I think being honest like that is a good way to go. I will try to make myself look vulnerable first so he doesn’t interpret it as some sort of power play.

It’s just so refreshing reading your comments. 

I’m on the edge of hopelessness, because I feel misunderstood, by everyone. Even my family who I value so much because of their commitment to me, I have to be on my toes constantly, making sure I don’t say something which hurts them.

Under the new laws, which will apply from 29 March 2020 until 26 September 2020, you cannot give a Notice of Intention to Vacate to move out of your home unless you:

-	are suffering severe hardship (for example: financial reasons due to COVID-19)
-	need special care
-	received an offer of public housing
-	need to move into temporary crisis accommodation
-	live in special disability accommodation resident and the landlord’s registration to provide this accommodation has been revoked
-	If any of these reasons apply you can give a 14-day Notice of Intention to Vacate in writing to end your tenancy.

A landlord cannot claim compensation or ask you to pay lease-break fees if you terminate your lease early by giving a Notice of Intention to Vacate in these cases (and in cases involving family violence or personal violence intervention orders).

You can also apply to VCAT to ask that your tenancy agreement be reduced if you are in a fixed term agreement. You can only do this if you are experiencing severe hardship. Before making a decision VCAT will take into account both the hardship you may suffer if the agreement cannot be reduced and the hardship the landlord may suffer if it is reduced."

philosophy,fou2vz3,t1_forqc84,1588074645.0,"Fact is some websites wouldn’t exist without advertising because 

-	Donations rarely pay as well as advertising
-	Not every website has a brand that can sell merchandise (you don’t see many people wearing WebMD T-shirts around do you?)
-	Subscriptions imply paywalling all or some content and if everyone did that consumers wouldn’t be able to reasonably pay for so many individual subscriptions

An actually promising alternative was mining crypto in exchange for website visits, but as it stands this is associated with malware. Another alternative is consumer polling, where you have to answer some questions in order to access content. This method is pretty immature and requires repeat visitors because usually the first poll establishes the visitor’s demographic, and some demographics might not be interesting to market researchers, etc. Being big enough to get sponsorships and product placements isn’t a reality for most.

Advertising is an old, well-established concept and it is here to stay. Trust me, publishers hate intrusive ads and rogue adverts and bullshit redirects as much as visitors. There’s little you can do about it as a publisher, you’re at the mercy of the big networks, or rather one network Google AdSense. Google have all of the capacity and power to wipe such intrusive advertising from existence (both in the platform and browser ends), but they choose not to because it would cut into their profits, and instead effectively scapegoat publishers. Imagine being harassed by some random algorithm because two or three words on your website imply “dangerous or sexual content” when this is not the case, the words are innocent, and you have no recourse but to remove or rewrite, as you now down to your towering overlord, and yet you see all sorts of rubbish and scams being pushed onto your work through ads."
