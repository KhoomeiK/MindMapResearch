When all the students, and teachers constantly chastise you, make fun of you, insult your work, and use you as an example of a ""failure""...

CPTSD,f86kw30,t3_dzaye3,1574300720.0,"This is so relatable. 

I've been unemployed for a year and nearly 5 months. The family has been cracking down hard (ya know, those damn distant relatives who just HAVE to make a big deal regarding anything), and treating me as if I'm a failure due to my issues. 

My previous job (first & only by the way), I held down for 5 years. Constantly given the promise of a promotion, raise, and department move... however, my manager found it funny to tease these things, then withhold them because ""I have anxiety and get overwhelmed too easily"". 

The position(s) I'd be promised to have/guaranteed raises would ALL go to brand new employees who had barely been working at the store. Out of the 5 years of employment, I went the last 3 with no raise. 

Due to the lack of funds, I couldn't ever afford doctors appointments when I'd call in sick. My very last day, my manager pulled me off the schedule till I came back with a doctor's note... pulling me off basically meant ""Don't come back without a slip""... so I didn't. 4 days later, she's running around claiming that I quit on my own terms. That woman was just awful to those committed to her department. 

She'd bully & make fun of me in front of customers during panic attacks... that only led to flashbacks while at work... making me incapable of functioning properly. Eventually, the customers started treating me worse and worse as time went on... cause my manager LOVED putting others down, and all the customers LOVED her (cause she was damn good at faking being 'nice'). 

Apologies for the mini rant, I'm just glad I found a sub dedicated to C-PTSD. It's refreshing to see that other people feel the same way. I just wish the stigma behind it would end, and that humans would treat each other better."

emotionalabuse,f84tu4c,t3_dyt477,1574260557.0,"Absolutely, it can. 

Emotional abuse has a very strong impact on the mind. It has the ability to take you, break you, and tear you apart.

Our brain is an organ, emotional abuse can be seen as an injury to that organ. It changes our perception, it rewires our thinking patterns, and leaves us in a state of fear & confusion. 

As we move forward, and the relationship takes a deeper toll, we begin to question everything we stand for... we even begin to question who we are. 

We feel lost, crazy, and begin to spiral. As we fall downward into the spiral, we lose touch with ourselves, and begin to question our fate mercilessly. We find ourselves driven to get out... not just out of the relationship... but the cycle that follows it."
emotionalabuse,f80rilf,t1_f80ocu9,1574136313.0,"Oddly enough, my ""friend"" is having the same issue regarding ""being underneath a males thumb""... even though distance has been implemented, and ground rules have been set, cutting her off is something I have trouble doing as well... cause her safety concerns me. 

To ""stop caring"" is difficult, and for people like us, it just doesn't happen. A part of us will always wonder, worry, and long to know how they truly are. 

This could be seen as a period of growth on her end as well. Traveling abroad, and experiencing the world might help open her eyes. 

After I moved, my friend ended up moving as well... states away with her lover. Their relationship is tumultuous (much like the friendship I shared with her), but it's been helping her realize her mistakes... And now she wants to change.

Although I don't fully believe she's ""grown"" yet, I'm still rooting for her, and hoping she makes better choices along the way. I think that's what your friend need a also, time to reflect."
emotionalabuse,f7xjfjr,t3_dxyns8,1574060033.0,"She is absolutely, 100 percent being emotionally abusive. 

ALL of these signs you listed remind me so much of a friendship I've been dealing with... And it took me years to realize the toll, and impact the abuse has taken on me. 

Her behavior is self centered, she is only putting her life, her ideas, her feelings, her wants, her needs, her wishes, her idea of you/what she wants/what she expects of you at the surface of it all. 

A healthy friendship would be her including you, listening to you, hearing your ideas out, respecting your boundaries, showing support, encouraging you every step of the way. Embracing your needs, helping achieve what you want .... she'd be putting in as much effort as you. Instead, she does the opposite, which is mentally taxing on a healthy/empathetic soul. 

Getting out of a friendship like this is difficult. I  was trapped until I was forced to move. She was such a ""good friend"" that she couldn't even be there... didn't even try to visit that whole last week... then had her dad shows up right as we're leaving, expecting me to wait for her. 

Once distance was put in place, it was easier to find where I should be headed in life, and I was able to focus on myself for once. I'll always love her like a sister, but it's been a tough friendship to navigate. 

Are you able to take some time away from her? Some time to clear your head? You deserve a better friend, that's for damn sure."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f068i5m,t3_d3xpzk,1568431889.0,"It's a method commonly known as: Grey Rocking. Read about it [Here](https://www.e-counseling.com/mental-health/what-is-the-grey-rock-method/)

When a narcissist is in the midst of attacking their victim, they are looking to provoke their victim, and get their victim to lash out/act out. 

When an individual choses to respond by using the 'grey rock', it's to give the narcissist what they **don't** want, which is: Emotional detachment, reacting calmly, quietly, act uninterested, or bored with the narcissists attempts of manipulation. 

Verbal exchanges & conversation is advised to be kept at a minimum. Acting like a rock, and being emotionally non-responsive typically bores the narcissist... he was merely trying to deter the situation... yet the abusive Amber just would not stop!"

I grew in a home where yelling was the standard way of communication between my parents. I suppose being under the influence during every waking hour was a contributing factor to this... The overall vibe was always tense. The whole neighborhood could hear what went on in our home... and I was often embarrassed to show my face.

I find myself apologizing constantly out of fear that anybody/everybody is angry at me. Yelling is an automatic trigger...."

In reality, he just doesn't wanna deal with anything. If he has to utilize an ounce of emotion or thought, ""Its too much for him!""

These narcs and their phone excuses too... so goddamn annoying. ""Why are you trippin'?"" They ask... we're trippin' cause we're not dumb and just want the honest truth.

I feel like I'm a parent teaching a grown adult about ""Respect, emotions, common sense"".... their egos are so huge though that they refuse to listen to us. It's bullshit."

I've had so many people bully/hurt me that it's difficult to find trust. The bullying has led me to believe that I'm always being laughed at by everyone, or made fun of.

I try to convince myself that I'm just delusional, but it's difficult when it's happened my whole life. The negative thoughts seem to outweigh the positive ones, so I'm always assuming people are thinking the worst of me... when they possibly aren't."
