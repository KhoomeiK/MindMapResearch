No matter how hard I pray for snow in our country, it won't just happen simply because geography. No matter how hard I prayed for my ex to survive his accident, he cant coz he suffered serious trauma.

Instead, I pray for inner strength, peace and such to be able to handle whatever this world throws at me, be it death of a loved one, failure, etc. And  come out of it even stronger. Prayer is a not make-a-wish program, i suppose. I think it goes past physical, and more on spritual. 

But that's just me. I hope you figure it out soon for yourself. It's good to rant, at least you get to examine your faith."
