socialwork,fr1qc6x,t1_fr1gx6j,1589824147.0,"As someone considered a fundamentalist Christian I'm still confused how people can read the Bible and take out of it that some people aren't worthy of help or support. Or really how you could read it and conclude that the Republican policies are biblical.

 I read the code of ethics and I can see how it lines up with scripture TBH. My Bible says God is not a respecter of person. He will help anyone who reaches out to Him. So we should do that. He doesn't place more value on one person than another. So I don't do that either. He gave us free will, so I should never try to impede someone's else's right to make their own choice for their life.

  I think a lot of Chrisitians are only Republican because of abortion. They could get behind almost anything else  but they vote on a single issue, at least in my experience when I've had political talks with others who share my faith. 

Personally Im independent but tend to lean left."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fp0rrpv,t3_gan0be,1588215479.0,I am also going single on purpose for the first time and I LOVE IT. I'm planning on going at least through November cause that'll make a full year but I may extend it.  First thing I did was get me some time consuming hobbies. Painting. Learning to play an instrument. Cooking. Just filling my time with things I enjoy that make me happy and feel accomplished. It's natural to feel lonely when you feel like the only attention that matters is male attention. Start making new friends. Rekindle old friendships. You can fill that loneliness with things other than men. Also consider therapy. It can be really helpful to talk to someone who can help you notice and alter your negative thinking patterns and deal with any other internal issues you may be having

Not sure where you are but in the US you have options depending on the state you are in. 1st is school records. If she was diagnosed with ID before 18 she should be available for most services. Then getting her declared incompetent in a court of law. What this looks like is proving she doesn't have the ability to make her own choices and you could be appointed conservative. You'll need a lawyer and it can be lengthy, difficult, and expensive but that's probably your best option. She has the right to decline any and all services, and you cannot force her to accept help.

I'm not going to tell you what to do, because it's your choice. I think if you stay in contact with her if it should only be so you can show some healthy relationship examples to those children. That's the only reason I'm in contact with my mother. Once my brother is out of her care, I won't talk with her anymore. 
If you decide to stay in contact, set your own boundaries and hold her accountable to them. She doesn't need to know what they are, and telling them usually doesn't help but if she says something manipulative, just quietly excuse yourself. Everytime you visit have an escape plan for if you want to leave sooner than planned. Basically having a relationship with a narcissist is playing by their rules while balancing your boundaries.

I live and work in a very rural area in a rural state and I just don't see it doing anything but hurting our small businesses and causing people to loose jobs. Living wage in our area is something like 10.50 an hour. Which I think it totally doable for most places, but 15 dollars is too much for a minimum for small businesses, local restaurants, etc where we. I just feel like this should be a states issue because each state has a different cost of living and therefore should have a different minimum. I know it's a small thing, but I don't want to see more people in my social services office unemployed, unable to pay their light bills because the local pizza place can't afford to pay 15 an hour and keep that many employees. In big cities and places where cost of living is insane totally see the need, but I'm worried it will bankrupt our area. It may be a small issue for some, but for me it's a big deal.
So I'd like just some general feedback. Is there anyone else voting for Bernie with the same concern? Has he already addressed this for rural voters like me? Any kind of resource links, or info is super helpful. I wanna make an informed decision."

You're hoping that if you get enough answers telling you to stay then it'll be right. It won't be. He already tried to break up with you, so he doesn't want to be with you. believe him and leave. You can do better"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fcntev4,t3_ei2gry,1577818061.0,This is hard for me. I have such a hard time naming things like that. It always comes back to what I can do for others. I know those are bad qualities but that's also not all that I am.

AdviceAnimals,fclvdgo,t3_ehr651,1577757386.0,"Here's what you do to avoid giving money to someone out of pocket. Find resources in your area that may be able to help. Look for a Salvation Army, they can usually help with electric or rent and my local one does 2 hot meals a day. Look for a Community Action Agency. Tell them to Look in to LIHEAP programs, send the to DHS. I don't usually give cash unless it's someone I know and I never expect it back. If you give cash it's a gift and they can use it how they want at that point. Keep cheap gloves/umbrellas to give to homeless or you can even make bags of needed items for like 20 bucks for two bags (DO, toothbrush, gloves, handwipes etc) Learn to be generous but be smart about it"

2. Work on taking care of my hair better to get Max curls/limited damage
3. Update and clean out my wardrobe.
4. Get involved in more volunteer activities 
5. Don't date anyone who can't prove to me that my life will be better with them in than it is now. No more settling for project men. I probably just won't date at all and just focus on work and friends. 
6. Solo Travel to Niagra Falls & Williamsburg"

Telling his GF may be an option though cause she probably isn't aware he's 'shopping around'"

AskReddit,fbtb8vl,t3_ee8y3d,1577073420.0,I touched someone's lip. My pastor wife's lip to be exact. Basically she said she was getting a cold sore I thought she told me to feel it. She didn't. I touched it. It was awkward. We moved on.
ptsd,fbpud2p,t3_ee1olw,1577025159.0,"I know how you feel because I've been there. We have to learn that we 1. Can't change anyone. If someone is sucky and doesn't meet our needs, you can give them a warning, but you can't fix them. 2. Just because they aren't abusive doesn't mean they aren't a sucky partner. Just because it's better with them doesn't mean it's actually good or great. 3. The fear of being single is worse than actually being single. I was engaged until recently and I was so afraid of being single I was putting up with all kinds of behavior that wasn't cool. But he wasn't as bad as my ex's so I was willing to settle. Once we broke up, I lashed out, then tried to fix it, then begged for him back. Now that it's been a while I can look back and realize I'm happier single. I can go where I want, eat when and where I want, and spend my money on me. I can take myself on the dates he wouldn't. 4. Lashing out is a normally response but not a healthy response. Part of how abuse works is that 'push and pull' the intense love and attention countered by the hurt and saddness. So subconsciously when we are hurt or afraid of being abandoned we may mimic that behavior. It's not okay or healthy, but it's a learned normal response. So what do we do? We recognize that's not a healthy way to cope and try to learn a better way to handle that feeling of abandonment. You arent a bad person, you just learned something new about your self and now you have to opportunity to grow!"

FemaleDatingStrategy,fbm9sqf,t3_eds9ij,1576980620.0,"I was going to get married next year. Realize now he was a super LVM. But anyway he decided I needed to go on BC to make it easier. I started coming to my senses and calling him out on a bunch of crap and he zipped off. It's for the best, but I've stayed on BC anyway. It's KILLED my sex drive, but I don't need it right now so that's not been a down side for me at least. Also cleared up my acne and made my periods regular, light and I can skip if I want. However, my Doctor didn't mention all these other side effects and I'm starting to rethink... Blood clots, yes. Mood changes, increased chance of depression. yes. Decreased sense of smell? No. Changing your ability to evaluate potential matches? No. Basically everything on that list is news to me and I'm wondering if the few benefits I'm having are worth all those risks."

It's like lots of like high frequency energy (think high noted, fast vibrations) it's high up in you chest/body, and feels forward. Like your body wants to move forward.
