SelfHarmScars,fi5bast,t3_f64sub,1582159159.0,I had some similar to this. Mederma is a dream that helps with discolored scars. It‚Äôs about 20$ and you can fund it at almost any drug store. It doesn‚Äôt fix the scar if it is raised. But the color normalizes. Good luck friend!
SelfHarmScars,fi5b15z,t3_f6av6c,1582158979.0,Not exactly to help with the swelling. But a cream called ‚ÄúMederma‚Äù you can find it at almost any drug story/pharmacy. It‚Äôs on the more expensive side (20$) It makes scars look more like normal colors? I didn‚Äôt want to use it because I liked looking at my scars (oof) but it doesn‚Äôt mess with the raised. Just the color. And it doesn‚Äôt stink like some other creams. Sorry for the rant but it helped me. Especially if you are trying to not cut.
