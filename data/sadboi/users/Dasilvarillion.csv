acturnips,fr21l5f,t1_fr213mu,1589829583.0,Nah Iâ€™m not saying your scamming donâ€™t get me wrong. Not trying to be a dick either I just wasnâ€™t sure your aware having fruit all the time is helpful for moving and selling non native fruit is worth good bells. I move trees all the time and itâ€™s nice to just go to the orchard and get them. Sorry if I sounded mean about it
acturnips,fr20r1a,t1_fr20g5p,1589829176.0,I dunno because some people donâ€™t realize what they are giving away. They are new and donâ€™t know. How do we know your not just farming turnips from people to sell? Pretty weird request is all but hey people wanna give you them itâ€™s no skin off my back.
acturnips,fr1zvjf,t1_fr1y4ub,1589828763.0,Your kidding right? Because turnips only come once a week and are worth 600 bells each on some islands. Fruit regrow and plentiful. Setup an orchard pick half one day and the other half other day and youâ€™ll have daily fruit intake.
acturnips,fr1uqcq,t1_fr1udgf,1589826279.0,"No problem, itâ€™s like my favorite part of the game now. Lol Youâ€™ll have millions in no time. So always buy on Sundays for low and then sell high as you can get. You can also buy on other peopleâ€™s islands on Sundays to get a low buy price. Use this subreddit to find someone for that too."
acturnips,fr1tk8s,t3_gm6pbs,1589825708.0,"Itâ€™s a week long turnip game man, donâ€™t freak yet you have options. 1. ReFresh this subreddit often and try to get someone to let you sell on their island. Donâ€™t forget to tip its always nice since they are helping you make a ton of money.
2. Go to turnip.exchange website and try to join a queue to sell on someoneâ€™s island. It will show you there code when itâ€™s your turn. But read the description carefully a lot of people have fees they want.
3. Use Turnip calculator website to input your prices each day, it helps create a forecast for when your prices are going to be the highest for the week.

Lastly i have really good luck joining on Saturdays before the turnips go bad for prices 150+ it will at least get your investment back and then some. Iâ€™ve hosted twice on Saturdays myself"
