This is how it always start something small and the apologize for it the next day. 
I will say no man should ever put their hands on you no matter how upset they are. And if hes the type to do that this person isnt for you. 
There are plenty of men out there who dont ever do that sort of thing. And the fact that it's only been 2 months is a real red flag to me. I hope your okay and find some one better. Also the fact that you asked him to stop and he disregarded is really scary 
Stay safe!!"
Molested,fn1bldq,t3_fthz4g,1586558660.0,"WHAT ARE YOU DOING????
reading this made my brain hurt I've been molested too and I know how the overexagerating thing can be. 
BUT NO MAN IN THE RIGHT MIND WOULD BE HARD AFTER SITTING WITH THEIR LITTLE 8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ON THE COUCH. 

That's the part of the story that really did it for me!! I'd try and get a confession out of her make sure your recording ask why shes been touching her self this behavior is not normal!! 
You need to think about what's best for that little girl she could be hurting and no one else knows?? 

I would hate to hear that this type of shit went on any longer. You need to involve CPS (child protective services)"

For some dub reason 4kids canceled it in america
I do apologize I dont know any downloading sites"
Molested,fl00za6,t3_famgn2,1584687169.0,It's sad you even have to consider a question like that. Absolutely not. Its definitely not old enough even if you were some how aware what sex was. You were still a child at that age that curiosity over rules your idea or right or wrong because your not fully developed. FAR FAR TOO YOUNG shouldnt even be in question
Rapekink,fhz87wq,t3_f5jmvc,1581993109.0,"I can honestly say the same thing for me. Men's hands can be so strong and forceful I love the idea of them grabbing what they like weather I'm into it or not. 
I dont wanna say I'm super thick or anything but I workout and can say my bottom is the first thing people notice. Sometimes I have secret wishes where people would just touch me all they want I know I'll be into it...even if I struggle"
Molested,fgnoe9j,t3_ezghzb,1580949327.0,"THIS IS SO AWFUL WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
But please for the love of god dont blame your self. 
You said so yourself you were groomed because of the actions he took on you were younger can mess with your mind. Sometimes our bodies react to thinks and it can mess with our mind. Thos must have been really hard for you. It's your uncle to blame hes the one who caused this hurt you as a child and now the cycle is repeating because it's all you know you grew up with it and maybe in some part of your mind it's hard not to say no because again you grew up with him.

I will say I dont think your crazy for going back. 
It's horrible dark thing to think about. And I hate to admit it but I have fantasies about it and my abuser. I hate myself for it I hate him makes me want to kill the fucker. But its uncontrollable because of what happened to us. I will never go anywhere near my abuser but I think when your molested as a kid once in a while it's like were so use to it. Like maybe Stockholm syndrome kind of thing. 

I highly recommend therapy and talking things out. Not communicating about this kind of stuff can end in good results. 
I also recommend you going no contact on your uncle until your ready for some closure. 
I really really wish you luck in the future stay safe!"
Molested,ffpt4b1,t1_ffpsqkl,1580104723.0,"I dont think you read what I put correctly I said YOU SHOULD NOT have done that. Why on earth would you think this was ok I mean you just said you were 20 years old. Shes 13 and didnt know any better but you did.

I was saying I dont think it's as bad as other stories I heard as long as you didnt hurt her. As a bother you should be protecting her and not showing her explicit things. 

I was saying I'm sure by now though shes probably forgotten. But if you really feel the need to address it and apologize. 13 year old shouldnt be watching stuff like that to begin with a big brothers shouldnt be encouraging it.

I'm saying that you should have has the ability to tell her no your the adult in this situation"
Molested,ffpolgg,t3_eu9arb,1580100452.0,"ITS SO AWFUL EVEN HEARING SOMEONE THINK THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS STILL YOUR FAULT.
Absolutely not they new exacly what they were doing. They were sober they new it was wrong but lacked the inability to control themselves that is not on you! That's on them to chose their selfish pleasure over morals.

Just because a women gets drunk or high does not GIVE ANYONE the right to take advantage of something like that. 

They are the ones who need psychological help and attempted to hurt you. Its pathetic.

I'm so sorry you went through something like this no ones deserves it. And it's awful to hear you say you think you should own up to what he did. It was his MOVE to make and he did.
Stay safe girly you deserve better❤"
Molested,ffpo2jx,t3_euima7,1580100011.0,"I'm not gonna lie I was really nervous reading this hearing you were 20 and she was 13. 
I thought you were going to say you hurt her. 
This is definitely not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Although it was really weird that you were ok watching those scenes together I mean you could have let her watch it first on the laptop and than you watch it another time. But it's not like either of you had thoughts about each other or you said anything to her that would make her uncomfortable. I know stuff like this would happen when I was younger when I was watching movies with parents and scenes like this would come on it would just make me uncomfortable. 

I think depending on how bad the sense were I mean you said there were orgies?? That's straight up like porn. You definitely didnt make the right move by saying it was ok. Because she didnt know any better but YOU did. 
But I think it's something that can be let go of easily maybe that's just my opinion. 

I think its probably something that shell end up forgetting in the future if it bothers you that much maybe you should consider apologizing to her. Although you said it's been 2 years ago its possible she probably doesnt even think about it."
Molested,ffe4be7,t1_ffe2x60,1579836340.0,I think about maybe waiting to see if shell contact me. I mean shes still young now. I think she might try and contact me when shes older like maybe my age now. I'll just have to wait and see! Thank you so much for you kind words!
Molested,ffbdn44,t3_esl5tn,1579760874.0,"THIS THE SHIT THAT BE MAKING ME ANGRY AF.
Girl good for you yes you have every right to hate that son of a bitch. He was a grown ass man!! Doin that stuff to a child I'm still waiting for my father to die. Hes supposedly attempted suicide multiple times I hope one day hes actually fucking successful. 

My whole life I've had basically my whole family say he didnt do it. Or that i need to forgive him because hes still my father...excuse me. I never knew how to react hearing it as a kid I always felt so hurt and they made me feel like it didnt matter. But If somebody says that to me now as a 20 year old I will literally throw hands. I dont need to forgive shit. I'm allowed to be angry and I'm allowed to feel the way I feel. I dont even speak to my brothers because they wanted me to have a relationship with him. Any time I'd try and have a decent conversation they had to bring up my dad. If you wanna sit there and not respect my boundries I dont need you in my life

All I can say is you are not alone! I really hope you can have a safe recovery I know stuff like this follows into your adult good stay safe and good luck. You are loved❤"
Molested,ff2iq2y,t3_eopmru,1579507910.0,"THAT IS SO AMAZING good for you for not giving up. I wish it was the same for all of us. 
Sadly mine had already been help in court and was not sentenced very much time and most importantly he isnt even a register sex offender I'm pretty sure they dropped the case due to lack of evidence or something I'm not sure. 
But still congratulations"
Molested,ff2hx22,t3_er9q7b,1579506878.0,"OH MY GOD. So I'm sitting here and it's like 1am where I live and I cant believe what I'm even reading. So from the sound of it you sound like your still very young.. I've been sexually abused by my father when I was young as well. It wasnt until my brother had caught what me and my dad were doing and he convinced me to tell someone. It was scary and I didnt know what was going on 

But I'm glad I did. I havnt seen him since the incident. 
If you feel like your mom wont do anything if you tell her or that she already knows for the love of GOD please tell a teacher or principal or any other adult you know would help you out. 

THIS CANT GO ON ANY LONGER. Keeping it a secret will only make things worse. 

YOUR FATHER IS VERY VERY SICK MAN
None of this is your fault dont feel bad for him growing up with a bad childhood is no excuse hes a grown adult and knows better I'm now 20 and could NEVER EVER imagine my self hurting or ruining another childs life 

This stuff will stick to you for a very long time and if you dont attempt to get out now it will eat you alive it's best to go get help at an early age so you can over come this
Your a very strong person and what this world has offered us in such early years is unfair and cruel but our time is coming and people like us we will run the world and make great things happen. 

You got this and I wish you the best! Be strong and be brave❤"
BPD,feiw485,t3_ep7csr,1579148816.0,IM SO GLAD SOMEBODY SAID IT. It's awful that I'm attracted to such awful traits it probably originated from the relationships I had around me as a kid but your so right I remember when I first found the show all I needed to read was the short summary and I was already into it lol
BPD,feiviey,t3_emyry4,1579148345.0,Your amazing keep going. We got this together!! Were not alone
Molested,fct9i25,t3_eijhwi,1577936491.0,"I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING. It's so awful when things turn me on all because of the sexual abuse I had as a child. Its unintentional and it happens. I'm really sorry she was not understanding. People who havnt gone through it will probably never understand where we are coming from. I'm so sorry this happened to you. 
I seriously wish you the best. I've talked to psychologists about it they say this is a normal reaction. Our bodies respond and react even if it's something oir mind doesnt want. Its part of being human. When someone gets raped the body will still react to what's happening to them. And sometimes that can really mess with our head.
Again I wish you the best"
Rapekink,fcjbotm,t1_fcjb3rl,1577682318.0,I would never ever have children because of my own emotional instability. And if I did have a child I would never ever EVER even consider staying. I dont know what pulls me in more the fact that he actually told me the truth from the start and going to therapy makes it seem like maybe he can change. And because I know what it's like to have stuff happened to them as a child I know how urges are and how things can be a turn on. BUT I NEVER EVER WOULD HURT A CHILD. I'm not sure why it feels like I'm on chains but it does.
