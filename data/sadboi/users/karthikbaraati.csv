The government has issued curfews and these people are going out like they are attending concerts. No one seems to understand the gravity of the situation.

Although people are staying home, many of them are utterly stupid.

Sunday, our prime minister declared a nation wide curfew and asked everyone to thank the health workers by clapping IN THEIR HOMES.

But guess what? Many people came out of their homes, assembled like India won world Cup and banged plates and utensils!
