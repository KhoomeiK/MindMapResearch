popping,fp7fcyr,t1_fp6otd9,1588369579.0,I posted an update in the comments. Went yesterday and got it burned off (it was definitely a plantar wart). Got progressively more painful throughout the day. Took two Tylenol and went to bed. Spoke to the doctor the next day and he said whatever I’m experiencing so far is normal and to ice it and pop any water blisters that might form. Just taking it hour by hour now. Hope to god it doesn’t feel like I’m walking on a sharp rock for much longer.

lonely,fb2oft0,t3_eaxwgb,1576454748.0,"I can speak to feeling weak and out of shape. Just start with what you’re putting in your body. You need to eat well and properly so you’ll be able to move more, for longer periods of time. Which will eventually lead to getting some exercise, which will get you to eat better and have more energy. It’s an upward spiral and something you can immediately control without involving anyone else. Just start there. Start with ONE thing between now and the end of the month. That’s it. You’ll eventually find improving one aspect of life helps boost others. But that’s not your goal right now. Your thing is to get stronger. That’s all. Just start there man. And keep checking in on this forum."
SuicideWatch,faczhk8,t3_e8gjky,1575950917.0,Dude you have to go talk to someone right now. You need to report this.

You can and should get help. Those animals will do this again if they feel there are no consequences.

I wouldn’t define things yet either. Enjoy doing things together. Also make sure they are reciprocating in some way - teaching out to you to start a convo, talking about an event they are interested in going to, sharing more personal details about their friendships / family / themselves. Feel them out about day trips like a hike or something that involves more time together. The more affirmatives you get on things like these, the more you can move toward a more serious thing. Obviously - listen to her as well. Is she talking about having just gotten out of a relationship? Red flag - tread carefully. Is she talking about subtle future plans? Green light."
