DiscoElysium,fp55qv6,t1_fp27yxw,1588317217.0,Oh thank god it's not just me. I cry for my old macbook pro when it was showing me this. Game runs fine otherwise can still click on the 2nd shoe and have dialogue with the manager. This freaked my beans!
SuicideWatch,fnxqczy,t1_fnxp9wo,1587344120.0,"Thank you! I've mellowed out. parents left to go get groceries. Its cathartic to release my feelings out in the open. I think that's what I needed. Next week I start up my job at Amazon full time graveyards. Now I have an excuse to get out of the house. I tend to forget that normalcy will come in time. I'm not a failure if I can bring some form of schedule into my life. I just needed to remind myself of that.

Have a great day!"
SuicideWatch,fnxnn9l,t1_fnwh6pe,1587342456.0,"Sounds like you are living my life. My dad hits me everytime I swear. Even if I'm like ""Fuck Yeah!"" Or ""This shit is the best!"" Yknow normal terms for excitement he hits me. I can't call the cops though because he makes the money in the house and I'd be screwed.

""He picked up on the swearing. Not the fact his own daughter wanted to die.""

Yup that is my exact thought. I hope it helps knowing you are not alone in this."
SuicideWatch,fnxmkei,t1_fnpi9vg,1587341790.0,Yeah I have my parents come in at 3am in my room to yell at me that I'm not asleep when I am. And I pretty much lay in bed all day because I dont want to deal with them anymore.
