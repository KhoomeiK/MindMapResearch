stimuluscheck,fni7ez6,t1_fni6vwc,1586975245.0,So I didn’t need to file. I grossed under the limit by far. But was nervous so after I got approved thru TurboTax for the stimulus I filed my 2019 return just to be safe. Now I’m just stuck waiting. Unsure if I will get in trouble using the non filer option as I did meet the minimum threshold ( under 1200) too but I still filed :(
stimuluscheck,fni2k0t,t1_fni2fl0,1586972896.0,So am I allowed to go to the irs website and add my bank info? I did file with TurboTax and got approved for my stimulus through them before the irs set theirs up.
