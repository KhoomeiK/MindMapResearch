My Mum (a Londoner born and bred) has been gone 15 years as of last Friday.  It was Mother's day. It's a little English owned and run shop that I haven't been to since October that I just found out was actually open for Take Away, but too far for any delivery. I even stopped a a grocery store to get a full bottle of malt vinegar before hand.  I found a shady spot and we dug in. It was piping hot,  drowning in vinegar  (at least mine was!)  and I got a neat little thank you from the shop afterwards.  OK, not particularly funny but since I still haven't been stimulated  and F&C's were going to be my non - bill spend, I'm hoping that this will send out a message to the Universe that I REALLY needed proper F&C's!!!
