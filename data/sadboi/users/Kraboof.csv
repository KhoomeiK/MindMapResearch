bipolar,ertuu9c,t3_c3v6ye,1561253955.0,Fuck yeah congrats. Trying to be sober myself. It’s hard but holy shit it’s worth it. Don’t let us be another statistic about mental illness and drug addictiction
bipolar,eroypc3,t1_eroy1pc,1561092878.0,It always does. But good thing you stronger. Trust me you stronger
bipolar,erowb1r,t3_c33w4n,1561090635.0,Sounds about right. Don’t focus on it too much man. It’ll eat you up n you don’t need that
kratom,erewhdw,t1_erevgsp,1560794469.0,Yeah honestly I think it’s just personal experience. Def all my OTHER WD symptoms way worse with classic opioids. It’s just the RLS that got really bad with kratom when I was doing anything more than 4 gs. I would keep pinching myself and shit because pain felt better than the kratom RLS
kratom,erd4wzz,t3_c1gfvr,1560730998.0,Very much so. Used kratom for the opiate rls and withdrawals and I found kratom rls was actually worse. I just watch my dosage.

bipolar,eq7rt68,t1_eq0cusv,1559852115.0,I’m sure it’s beautiful! Keep dancing either way!
bipolar,eq7rnz9,t1_eq0ekig,1559852039.0,You’re not alone. I always feel like I could imitate very well. Create... not so much. Oh well
bipolar,eq7i3an,t1_eq6d0r2,1559847139.0,Big mood.
bipolar,eq19dlg,t1_eq0gvxq,1559703975.0,Touché. It is hard to put in those hours.... I used to play around with music I just got very unfocused also. ADHD is at play too. But it is always one thing really I can fall into especially making playlists.
bipolar,eq0ahdb,t1_eq037zr,1559681026.0,Thanks man this is very important to me. It means a lot I think I can see what you mean
bipolar,eq02fnh,t1_epzywgd,1559677081.0,You ever try music? Writing? Any other art?
bipolar,epzwley,t1_epzu6by,1559674047.0,Yeah right? It’s amazing we get to see something that relates. I always relate how I feel in how I say I’m always chasing beauty I’ve told a few people that’s what I feel like at least.
bipolar,epuzq16,t3_bvyqgc,1559520421.0,Hang in there. Everything is temporary
bipolar,epqz180,t3_bvm4ih,1559415141.0,Ride it out. Keep focusing on your art(because it’s beautiful!) and wait to see what happens
