MentalHealthSupport,esgtylc,t3_c7mm94,1561966746.0,"There’s an app called “Calm Harm” available on the App Store. There are basically six different activities you can choose from: comfort, distract, express yourself, release, random, and breathe. You can choose whichever one feels right for you at the moment and there will be extra activities/prompts to guide you further on. :) please take care of yourself."
