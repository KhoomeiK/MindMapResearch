I will consider either rebuilding the thing or switching it back to manual and fuel the train at the station instead. Issue with this is that I´m apparently completely retarded because I just realized that I´m turning sulphuric acid into barrels in order to transport it by a train just to instantly turn it back into acid. Well that´s not the issue. The issue is that the acid goes to two different stations and possibly more in the future and a problem that can arise is unbalanced barrels. This happened in my uranium mining where one outpost ran out and accumulated all the barrels, starving production of sulphur barrels which relied on the barrels coming back, which halted all uranium mining.   


So, next on my to do list is to just use a single sulphuric acid train station with fluid wagons which solves all of those problems. Then I just gotta figure out how to make fluid wagons unload in a balanced way, because what usually happens is that one tank empties faster than the others at the destination, so one wagon can´t unload anything because its tank is full even though there is space in another tank because they don´t even out for some reason. Or krastorio ones don´t anyway. This is a major problem with LTN, and i started an experiment to only request once the requesting station can hold twice the fluid."

Cringetopia,fn7yvdp,t1_fn7u6gu,1586730412.0,"Whether Jesus existed is an ongoig debate, and it's hardly one-sided in favour of him existing. I will link an article from an atheist questioning the evidence for him.

https://www.atheists.org/activism/resources/did-jesus-exist/

According to the article all of the original evidence for Jesus comes from the gospels. Flavius Josephus wasn't even contemporary and was born year 37 AD. 

The gospels are very shaky sources because their real identities are unknown and it's not even certain they were eye witnesses. Their works have been modified and the different gospels show signs of plagiarizing each other. That is no foundation for anything. 

Hinduism talks about Krishna. To assume that Krishna is Jesus you need to already assume that Jesus exists. To Hindues, Jesus is not Krishna.

>If someone didn’t think this, then where did Christianity come from?) So now we have to ask ourselves why people thought this.

People also believed in trolls and giants, that the Persian army attacking Greece under Xerxes was 10 times bigger than it actually were, that Greek gods fought in the siege of Troy and that there are Krakens out at sea. For all we know someone might have been looking for Jesus but went to the wrong place and instantly assumed he had resurrected and then retroactively added content to make the story more believable, because the brain is good at modifying memories.

But do we even know whether the original person who said that Jesus had resurrected believed that he had? It might have been a tale, a legend, anything. Maybe the resurrection part was added to make the story more spectacular.

>Well, if that were true, why would they be so willing to die such horrible, painful deaths for their faith? One of them was even tied to a horse and dragged down the street until he died. These people obviously had good reason to believe what they did. If there were any doubts in their minds, they would’ve given up

Denial perhaps? Because the sources are shaky, it can't be assumed that what is said to have happened really happened, so people crying out that Jesus was alive might just not have happened. But you can't assume that just because people are willing to die for their faith, it means that they have good reason  to believe. Have you heard about the cult of heaven? Or perhaps the cult that starved themselves to death because they believed they didn't need food because their belief in god would be enough? They all died, and they were all proven wrong."

We see animals killing each other and stealing from each other all the time, so why are we different? Why do we have this sense that certain actions are wrong? If we truly evolved to survive, then our instincts would tell us to steal and kill, but the opposite is true. Our instincts tell us that’s wrong. Where does that sense come from? Any credible philosopher will tell you that without a God or any other higher being, morality is non-existent.

You are missing a key ingredient. And that is the fact that cooperation  is evolutionarily beneficial. Scientific experiments have been done to confirm that having morality can be beneficial to an individual and could have evolved.

If your moves were just as good as your opponents, you probably got a draw, even if your chances of winning are higher with white. The higher the player levels, the more draws happen generally. Computer programs draw most of their games against each other."

iamverysmart,fn61f7e,t1_fn3i422,1586683670.0,"Idk but to me it doesn't seem like most people start thinking about how the speed of light connects with time dilation and how the actual speed of light could be describes as infinitely fast but observably constant due to said dilation, or whatever one might think about. And that's just a matter of interests and priorities. It's ok not to care about science, and it doesn't make you a lesser person. 

I think believing in your own superiority in this way is a coping mechanism from being ostracized by people around you for being different"

unpopularopinion,fn37bie,t1_fn1r573,1586614599.0,"Piss Jesus is a work asking whether the means to create art influence the art itself. 

The early dadaism used nonsense to ask what constitutes art. A professional artist putting a toilet seat on an exhibition for example. The difference is that these things aren't there to be beautiful, they are just there to ask questions and challenge ideas. 

This does not mean that there aren't just pointless nonsense in art, but just because something isn't a traditional painting doesn't mean there is no thought behind it"

iamverysmart,fn2sqwn,t1_fn2sja8,1586601809.0,"I said it was a coherent argument. Not a good one. He doesn't support it with any evidence, so the truthfulness of it depends on unknown factors unless you have prior knowledge supporting it.

Edit: to answer your question. Actions taken to solve a problem could have backwards effects. For example, buying ecological food to save the environment has a counterproductive effect according to my friend's father who studies this sort of things. That is because of the increased resources required to produce the same quantity of food. Obvious solutions can have negative side effects negating whatever good they do. But regardless, while it is not the case that your actions have NO effect, the effect they have can be negligible in comparison to what you can achieve with larger scale political decisions. This all depends on facts that I do not know"

Only that they are correlated, and it might as well be that the type of person who might commit a sex crime is drawn to porn but would have committed sex crimes regardless.

In order to test this scientifically one would need random participants placed into maybe two groups where one watches porn and one does not, and then you examine if it creates any differences between the groups."
