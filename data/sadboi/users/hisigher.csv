Anxiety,fhnqlbq,t3_f3xtas,1581731005.0,This is such an excellent monologue to use when you’re panicking. My therapist taught me about it and it helps so much! You are safe.
Anxiety,fgrg60l,t1_fgr5sxa,1581046003.0,It’s a difficult situation but it sounds like you need to talk to her for the sake of your mental health! 7 months is a long time to be uncomfortable where you live and that really wears you down. If you’re honest she should understand. Good luck!
Anxiety,fggwsin,t1_fgfhofs,1580771310.0,The toaster always makes me jump! Anyone around will laugh at me but I know that if it startles me really badly then my anxiety is getting worse.
Anxiety,fggvvdv,t1_fgf25qf,1580770723.0,Me too! Or when someone has a dry mouth when they’re talking. Bleh! It makes me want to curl up in a ball.
Anxiety,fgeebft,t1_fge9kjp,1580697583.0,I do this too! But then I worry that I’ll upset/insult whoever I’m with when I leave. Anxiety sucks!!
Anxiety,fgee2ph,t1_fge8mx4,1580697427.0,Me too! It’s nice to know I’m not the only one.
Anxiety,fgdpr30,t1_fgdpl3j,1580685184.0,Ahhh chewing makes me so anxious too!!
digitaldrawing,fdsl9g6,t3_en018r,1578704634.0,This is so awesome!!! I would love to know the story behind your character!
memes,f9t5xtn,t3_e6mfha,1575609882.0,I’m hoping that the rewind for the year was so low effort because they are working on a decade rewind to release later
Awww,f8uhc7j,t3_e2466s,1574829458.0,Look at that face!! So cute
FemaleDatingStrategy,f866k4w,t3_dz6dxx,1574290946.0,"Or maybe witches are one of the only sources of feminine power we see that aren’t sexualized? Women all over are starting to recognize that and appreciate it for what it is. 


Also would be nice to destroy the patriarchy but one step at a time. Recognizing our power is a good start."
FemaleDatingStrategy,f7hpob3,t3_dw9vl4,1573745246.0,Guys really like to think of themselves as much more important to us than they are. They love giving themselves validation through blame lol
minecraftsuggestions,f7f2a2u,t1_f7f0w69,1573670863.0,"I understand that I can edit the post. I can change it to brainstorming if you think it will encourage people to suggest their ideas in the comments. 

Honestly the idea was just something I thought of late last night and thought I would add it here. I didn’t know it would cause so much trouble for you lol. Clearly you’ve been on this sub for a while so you would be able to say whether or not an idea has been suggested before. I really just thought it would be cool to have another mob, and another throwable weapon. 

You didn’t offend me by assuming I was a dude (yeah I’m a girl), though in the future you should avoid assumptions by using words like they or them. I know gender doesn’t really matter on this sub but it’s just easier and that way you don’t leave anyone out!"
minecraftsuggestions,f7f01ou,t1_f7emrgu,1573669493.0,"Okay like I said I’m new to this sub so I really didn’t know that there had been other cave civilization suggestions or that this idea wasn’t “fleshed out enough” why are you still on the thread if you’re just going to continue to bug me to change the flair to brainstorming and complain about how unoriginal my idea is. If it’s bothering you so much then leave. 

Also not a “he”"
minecraftsuggestions,f7ebrbi,t1_f7e6bf0,1573653357.0,"Thanks! Yeah I get why people say there isn’t a ton of detail in the idea but I didn’t want to go into too much detail to make it boring and in case someone else wanted to suggest something else in the comments that I maybe didn’t think of. 

Like glow worms! That could be so useful/cool in caves. They could be like sea pickles but hang from the ceiling!"
minecraftsuggestions,f7eb0go,t1_f7dvm1i,1573652738.0,"Lol sorry, like I said I’m new to this sub so I’m not 100% sure how it works. I’ll try to use the proper tags next time."
christmas,f5j19d3,t3_dnrg9m,1572220131.0,What bothers me is that Remembrance Day gets overlooked because of all of the Christmas products and movies. I’m Canadian so we have thanksgiving and Halloween in October. I refuse to buy anything Christmas related or put up my tree before November 11th. I feel it’s just not respectful.
christmas,f4ym45j,t3_dm36j3,1571879703.0,Lovely!! I’m just getting into embroidery so I can appreciate how much work this takes!
Pets,f4k5oyu,t1_f4gtqje,1571636457.0,I hope you’re wrong :(

Anxiety,f495roj,t3_djv3m8,1571457491.0,Needed this today
Anxiety,f45dwa3,t3_djbekk,1571373395.0,Great work! I just got my license last year and I was even able to drive in a busy city this summer! (Obviously had a panic attack but I still did it!) I find driving really helps with self confidence and independence!! You should be super proud!
13WeekWeightLoss,f3yfxyl,t1_f3y8in9,1571253396.0,"Thanks! Yes, new to keto. Well, I tried it before but didn’t stick with it for very long. Hopefully my body will adjust soon so I’m not so tired getting through workouts."
Anxiety,f321cjv,t3_df8ilv,1570590474.0,I used to get like this a lot (still do sometimes) but I just started to remind myself that people really just don’t care about what you’re doing enough to notice it. I just remind myself that they’re all caught up in their own problems and their own insecurities and they barely have enough mind space to notice someone else’s. People are so self absorbed that they honestly don’t care one bit. It sounds a little harsh to say that dgaf about anyone else but it really helps me relax in public settings. I hope this helps you too!
interestingasfuck,f308lwe,t3_dezlrc,1570548886.0,It looks cool but it isn’t functional to the people using the ramp or the stairs. We studied these in architecture school!
Anxiety,f2ygudu,t1_f2wwjex,1570491234.0,Thank you so much! I hope I did well. Nothing I can do now but wait for their response.
Anxiety,f2ygruz,t1_f2wvt4a,1570491200.0,Thank you! You’re right. I think they could tell I was a bit nervous but it went okay!
Astronomy,f290y7n,t3_dciv5e,1570076586.0,Wow the moon really just out there lookin this gorgeous
heartbreak,f16dupo,t3_d8007j,1569209492.0,Chill song that makes me cry sometimes: clairvoyant - the story so far
AskReddit,f0qu26s,t3_d5ye2u,1568866503.0,"Right after I got my wisdom teeth out I was on some serious pain medication and I was a little out of it. There was a nurse helping me wake up from the anesthesia and telling me about how to avoid pain and whatnot. I tried to tell her “You’re lovely” which I often say to people when they are being helpful, but with the gauze in my mouth I worry it sounded like I said “you’re ugly.” I hope I didn’t make that sweet old woman sad :("
Anxiety,ezi8koh,t3_d16xco,1567922975.0,"I find that picturing one of your favourite places, and then listing as many things you can think of (sights, smells, sounds, etc) helps me a lot. List everything in excruciating detail. It helps you calm down by picturing a place where you feel comfortable and also gets boring for your brain just thinking about mundane things so it eventually shuts off (it does for mine at least.) hope this helps! I wish someone had told me this trick when my anxiety first started getting bad."
The100,ewm3y93,t3_comw5w,1565542646.0,"I totally agree with the Bellarke thing, but I really hope we get a bit more time than one episode with them as a couple (if we even get to see them as a couple at all, frick you, Jason) I think we deserve more time because we’ve literally suffered through 6 seasons of being baited with Bellarke content."
