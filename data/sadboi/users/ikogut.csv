You can use the shredded chicken in practically anything. I’ve even made enchiladas and frozen them to use a week or two later.

Also, sometimes a physical books is cheaper than the kindle version, so there’s that too."
unpopularopinion,fonx5gx,t3_g8hdc7,1587928214.0,This. Thank you. Yes. It’s why I am in zero rush to have kids even though I am now 30 years old and I don’t see any rush for me to have children knowing my own personal fear of turning into either my narcissistic pathological liar of a mother or my enabling father who honestly has never worn the pants in the marriage.
narcissisticparents,fonu3z5,t1_fontyql,1587926494.0,I second this! A virtual support group of some kind!!
JUSTNOFAMILY,fonsf8r,t3_g8h3ba,1587925552.0,Omg. I read that title and got chills. My female parental unit I friended me on Facebook and I know she’s waiting to use it against me and twist it somehow to say I did it. And I refuse to accept my male parental unit on there. Nope. Just. Nope.
CPTSD,fonnc2a,t3_g880x2,1587922771.0,Congratulations!! Much deserved!!
narcissisticparents,fonhzn5,t1_fonhnx2,1587919858.0,"My brother is 9 years older than me so luckily he never got sucked into it. But he also saw her behavior well before my eyes were opened up. She would always compare me to those kids too though. I remember when I wanted to live on campus for college she compared me to one of the girls saying “you can’t and won’t live on campus because so-so did it and she got kicked out for partying” even though she knew i didn’t and still don’t care about partying and was always more of a loner.

She also hated and still hates all my friends because she thinks they are worthless and liars. I just turned 30 and officially blocked her out of my life after she told my sister in law (whom I have an amazing relationship with) that I’m a pathological liar and that I have other mental issues. Gotta love when narcs expose themselves."
narcissisticparents,fongx0r,t1_fongq2d,1587919269.0,Omg I heard that shit all the time. And then I got in trouble for sitting in a corner with a book and my dog curled up next to me while all the other kids I grew up around “family friends” were out getting stuck in mud and being loud.
macarons,fonfrzk,t3_g86mgg,1587918649.0,I need these in my life.
narcissisticparents,fon9m7i,t3_g8bwss,1587915168.0,My only defense to that phrase is that it taught me to be independent and never rely on anyone for anything. Guess that backfired on my parental units.
personalfinance,fon9cn2,t3_g8c010,1587915014.0,"First, congratulations on taking your life and your future in your hands. My parents are horrible with their money as well so I had to learn it all by going to banks and companies that handle investing and such. 

I definitely recommend going to a few banks and not just the one you have your checking/savings in and asking them all for their rates and whatnot. And remember, no question is dumb."
unpopularopinion,folc5k9,t3_g7z0fr,1587859102.0,Yes. Same.
BreakUps,folb1fm,t3_g82dum,1587858453.0,And now I rewatch Gossip Girl again. Worth it.
audible,fol7248,t3_g7vzl0,1587856152.0,I’m in the US and I still don’t have that upgrade.
