migraine,fr23oy0,t1_fr1izun,1589830611.0,"I agree and I know some people have much worse symptoms.  My mom has migraines and she doesn’t get laid out for 3 days like I do; she can take a rescue med, take a nap and be fine.  My frustration comes when people know the severity of mine and try to downplay it because their migraines aren’t as severe.  Or think that if they can continue to function normally, I should be able to as well."
migraine,fr1fefa,t1_fr1fd1f,1589818770.0,And then some.
migraine,fr1f5h3,t1_fr1et25,1589818645.0,I know; it always made me so mad when she would try to say she gets them too but she “pushes through” and was able to do so because of her crappy peppermint oil.
aww,fr131q6,t3_gm0228,1589812285.0,Oh my heart...
migraine,fr11gka,t3_gm077y,1589811384.0,"Yes I used to feel guilty all the time because my old boss said she suffered from migraines but she could take some ibuprofen and be fine.  Not to mention she used to try and shill her shitty DoTerra essential oils on me to ease my pain.  Sorry psycho, your “roll on” peppermint oil isn’t doing me any favors. 

She couldn’t understand that when my migraine hit, I couldn’t think at all.   Not to mention I would usually be in my office puking in my trash can.   As much as I loved my work, I don’t miss that job at all."
MST3K,fr0zvx8,t3_glzv15,1589810460.0,"I’m so lucky my husband gets it and thinks it’s funny although it’s not his go-to for movie watching.   My best friend just didn’t understand, it wasn’t her sense of humor."
hsp,fr0j8oj,t3_glxolo,1589797623.0,I absolutely treasure and guard my early mornings. I love having my coffee and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I’ve found I need this time to mentally prepare for the day.  I’ve always been a morning person and love that my husband and son are night owls because I know my morning will not be disturbed.

They are all vastly different and I enjoy them for what they are.  Depending on my mood, I’ll go back and watch Freak Show, Hotel, or Roanoke and I just finished 1984 and loved it!  Tons of talented actors and great themes; I’m excited to see what’s next!"

sex,fqqun23,t3_gkd7na,1589572257.0,"I just wanted to chime in and I’m sure I’m just repeating what others have already said but it’s absolutely unacceptable for him to dismiss your discomfort in any capacity when it comes to sex.  

It shouldn’t take an hour long conversation complete with medical charts and graphs, a full WebMD explanation as to what a yeast infection is and blah, blah, blah.  You are not comfortable having sex right now.  Period.  If he cannot deal with that, tough."

DunderMifflin,fqljka3,t1_fqiyn9c,1589459761.0,"Me too!  Another one of my favorite little scenes is when Michael was fighting with Jan on the phone and Jim makes that remark to Pam about being left at a hockey game and afterwards, Michael and Jim just exchange a little look of confusion/exasperation.  (I think I’m remembering the context of the episode correctly lol).  It’s such a short moment but somehow seems to show their underlying connection or bond."

With the increasing number of infected and dying, what would you suggest as a solution?"
migraine,fq9w9r4,t1_fq9lv8h,1589208294.0,"Agreed.  I always avoid, especially now, going to the ER for mine but when it’s been consistent pain for 3 or 4 days, I will go so their meds can “break” the migraine.  The cocktail they give for migraines is great and almost instantaneous relief.

Hope you get relief soon!"
