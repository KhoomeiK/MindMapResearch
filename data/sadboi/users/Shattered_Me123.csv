Until I started viewing this subreddit, I had never seen anyone else with body bits like mine. I have a petite butt and large areolas and not much of a figure. This sub really helped me personally, as far as accepting the wide diversity that is the shapes and sizes our bodies come in.

Thank you so much for adding your artwork--that lovely body you inhabit--to this subreddit. You have a gorgeous figure that I don't see as flawed, it is uniquely and stunningly ""you"". I could go on but I'm worried I'm being weird haha ^_^;

I think it's normal to get frustrated and angry with parts we don't understand, both inside and outside of ourselves. 

The White Table trick can be really anything you want it to be--it's an internal meeting place for your headmates. I used a lounge for a while and I offered snacks and refreshments to anyone who wanted to talk. 

You visualize a space (maybe start simple, like a plain meeting room with a big white table) and send out an invitation to your parts: ""Hey. I have a space here, it's safe to talk, wondering if anyone has anything to share"".

Do you and Red have an agreement on the smoking? I try to work out deals with my parts. With one of them I say ""Cigarettes, alcohol, weed, junk food--pick two as your payment for fronting"" and that usually works out. I also try to do laundry and/or shower and/or burn sage for a bad smell. 

Also, I've noticed that some of my parts and I have dramatically different tolerances for alcohol and weed. I (the ""host""/core) have a low tolerance for alcohol, but I have two parts with a really high tolerance. I can be sloshed and someone else will front and be perfectly fine.

It. Was. Hell. 

I confirmed later that it was indeed an anti-psychotic (even though I showed no psychotic symptoms, I was just really really sad all the time). I felt like a zombie, I had *zero* communication with my parts; I never felt so alone. My head was full of runny cement all the time, I had no energy and no desire to do anything. I would sit in a room for a while, get up and shuffle somewhere else, only to sit again and take a nap. 

My advice is *do not go on medication unless you are 100% sure it is right for your system*. Your parts are there to help you, even when it doesn't feel or seem like it. They are a part of your history. If other things come up, like the depression or anxiety (I'm on an anti-anxiety that I can take as needed) then, sure, do what you need to do. But please, please, please, as someone who has been through it, don't let someone with a fancy piece of paper take your parts away. 

Other comments have it spot on: your focus should be on communication and healing. 

Good luck ♡"

""Sweetness - I am so sorry you are hurting like this. There is so much bad in this world, and unfortunately, you have been exposed to too much of it. That is awful, and I can see how much pain you are holding. Sometimes we are not good at holding pain, and what really sucks,   is other people are not good at it either. It's even harder for some people to hold the pain of others. What makes it easier for them, and for you, is learning to hold it ourselves. How do we do that? Some folks use creative outlets, some put on a favorite show or movie and have a good cry. Please, *allow yourself to cry* and *to feel bad*. This is a lot! Crying helps to relieve some of that pressure. Only you can know what's best for you. Try relying on system mates for support--they are holding pain too, a system is meant to help each other. I know there's a lot of people on this subreddit who would love to see your creative outlets.""

Wishing you all the best. Thank you for posting on here, I know times like these are very hard.

selfharm,ffaoe9e,t3_esfrd1,1579740704.0,"Dearest OP--and anyone else who reads this--your pain is valid. Your feelings are valid. I am so sorry you are hurting this much, I can certainly empathize with the self-harm predicament. 

I know I can't stop you from hurting. 

Please keep it clean. Please allow it to be enough. Please take care of what's there instead of going deeper. Going deep creates a whole host of issues that *you do not want*, like possible infection, needing stitches, doctors judging you (that one is from experience, I wouldn't want it on anyone). A friend of a friend of mine went so deep into their wrist that they caused permanent mobility damage. My friend was so heartbroken that they couldn't help that person. 

If you *must* create more endorphins: use the shallower cuts you have, let that be enough. Sterilizing wounds can really fucking sting--I personally use rubbing alcohol and antiseptic solutions. They stay clean and I can ride the high for a while. 

You are valid. You are enough.
