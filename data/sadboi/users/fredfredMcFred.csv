SeriousConversation,fqbhvhr,t1_fqaxmvp,1589237277.0,"Thank you for the understanding. This is not something I get to talk about a lot (since I finished therapy) and it shows with how I answered myself lol.

I don't believe my affinity for people is their shared experience *per se*, I believe I have a fear of people not understanding and thereby being unhelpful to me *in the event I relapse*, which is something I have accepted with the help of therapy (I say unhelpful, the actual real world realization of that scenario is messy to say the very least. Forgive me if that is obvious to you, I'm unaware of your level of knowledge of BPD symptoms).

> similar skills in therapy

This is something I haven't thought before. That would be the 'dream' so to speak (ceteris paribus). It could furthermore turn a mutually reinforcing relapse into a mutually reinforcing strength. On the other hand, it would narrow the field further, if it in fact it is something that I would need in a partner. Acceptance certainly is key; the hard part for me is not knowing what I can and cannot change at the present time. For example, to use what you mentioned, as I accept myself more and more I probably won't feel the (potentially) compulsive need to tell new partners the worst of my history.

> Where they were on their journey. 

True. As people with severe mental illnesses go, I got into full recovery (medically speaking) at an incredibly early age. I should count that as a blessing with a side effect. At this age my impression may be colored not only by my own immaturity and unfinished development but others' as well.

I would love to know what questions I didn't ask. Can't wait to find out. /s"

Sometimes threads aren't about what you want them to be about. There are threads on why universities need better funding all the time and I completely agree with them lol it's just not really what this is about.

Never said it was mismanagement. Said ""if"". Hence journalistic investigation and leaks of reports which are pretty damming.

And the VC's salary and travel expenses suddenly increased around the same time it started running up deficits (while other universities weren't, obviously covid is the worst thing and will affect all unis but this was all before that).

You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT


Couldn't this just as easily be used to justify slavery? Indeed slavery was justified by scripture for much of antebellum America. Do you blindly follow every word of the Bible (if you are a Christian that is, apologies for the assumption if you're not). If you don't, why can't Muslims be given the same benefit of the doubt?
