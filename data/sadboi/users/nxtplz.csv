How do you live with yourself if you are guilty of murder and constantly try to claim your innocence? The main thing I have found in this case is that everyone involved is lying about something.

What exactly is wrong with wanting to be an athlete anyway? Athletes are walking advertisements for health and fitness. You have to dream big if you want to devote your whole life to something.

TheCircleTV,fmfmkqh,t1_fmctkg3,1586030408.0,I think they are just so bored being by themselves all day that they like having little missions to go on. But there is also usually a moment of reckoning where at least one or several people ask themselves why does it matter if someone is a catfish as long as they're nice.

cripplingalcoholism,fmfjr6z,t3_fusyd8,1586028704.0,"With regards to it not being your fault, that's only partially right. Maybe you should be more thoughtful of what you say and how you treat people. I've been in a relationship where my SO said cruel things to me and to think that you wouldn't at least have some guilt over that would make you a narcissist. It's ok to feel bad about things if there are lessons to be learned. Don't just call him selfish and move on. Think about how you can affect people more positively.
