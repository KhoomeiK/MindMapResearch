askwomenadvice,exjj8ba,t3_csvm10,1566351823.0,"your boyfriends behavior is not ok or normal. its not normal for him to be commenting things like that publicly on other peoples posts when hes in a relationship - no matter how much he tries to justify it its not normal, right, or ok. 

its also not ok for him to pressure you into doing Anythjng sexual, or implying that he will do it with someone else if you exercise your right to say no. 

it is not ok or normal for him to be comparing you to others or making you feel insecure about your body. thats the opposite of what a boyfriend should be doing."
offmychest,exfvybz,t3_csh465,1566249605.0,i called in sick to work today and felt really guilty... this made me feel so much better
askwomenadvice,ex4528y,t1_ex44u6k,1565998614.0,exactly right. op you keep saying in the comments that you dont intend to make her change her mind or manipulate her - then why the fuck do you feel the need to tell her you dislike her idea ? to make her insecure ? wtf

umass,evxabiy,t1_evx7ozj,1564886382.0,to get a single through disability you have to go through the process first and get documentation and a letter about the room specifically from your doctor before assignments come out. thats how i did it at least. idk if theyd accept it now but worth a shot ? good luck :-)
relationship_advice,evrk4kw,t1_evrjtsi,1564710474.0,i read the sidebar. not a rule — fuck off
relationship_advice,evrk3jk,t1_evrjqm3,1564710452.0,well its not. :) i checked :) and no its not relevant. i know our ages and im telling you its not. its weird wnd creepy to go on someones page deliberately trying to find out information they arent comfortable sharing and then post it on the post that they said multiple times they didnt want it being on
relationship_advice,evrjcv5,t1_evrhmph,1564709894.0,this is a massive invasion of privacy. how disrespectful can one person possibly be ? i literally told you i wasnt comfortable sharing my age on this post ans you dug it up like a fucking creep. and my boyfriends age is none of your fucking business and not relevant to my post at all. thats why i didnt include it. fuck off.
relationship_advice,evrfyut,t1_evref8j,1564707480.0,im totally prepared for him not to say it. in fact i dont want him to say it because that would be fake. im more concerned about his reaction and making sure it doesnt upset him/draw attention to him not being there/make him generally uncomfortable
relationship_advice,evrfvcy,t1_evre8w6,1564707423.0,thats true. ive loved him for years and hes cared about me for equally as long. so when we started dating within the week we were getting serious
relationship_advice,evrfsj6,t1_evre5de,1564707377.0,prefer not to disclose ages. its not so much that hes incapable of love necessarily just that he could be and hes not really there yet. he dated a girl for 5 years ans never loved her and he isnt sure hell ever make it there with anyone
