BipolarReddit,fnjgvaq,t3_g1z0xs,1586998709.0,"You're not alone! Many people in the subreddit have been through similar experiences that you are right now. Good news though, you're aware of it and seeking help here. Big first step.

I ended up having to take a semester off because I went too long before getting help. Going to the ER or psychiatric intake might be a disturbance and expensive, but it's worth it and doesnt last more than a week usually and you'll get your medication adjusted along with a medical emergency excuse to send to your school. I was able to get a refund and withdraw from the semester. Getting a refund is possible and the hospital bill will be less than that. 

I go to a Big10 university so its intense, not as much as a high end one like you, but I'm sure they are aware of the problems that arise from stress with mental illnesses. There is probably a disability resource center that could help you too and extend your deadlines which is another option. A hospitalization letter carries a lot of weight, you'd only miss a week, and there is hope to finish your last semester. (But if you're already behind and unwell it might be best to withdraw completely to give yourself time to recover)

The most important thing right now is to take care of your self, eat food, try to get sleep, and to get your meds adjusted. Ask your parents for help and explain to them what you're going through."
bipolar,fn49nne,t1_fn2jxmh,1586636892.0,"I believed I was once married to an Indian Prince in a spiritual realm. I also thought I was a god as this post suggests, and I went around writing thoughts and prayers down in different places. Once at a coffee shop I did this and the whole staff paused and looked around confused saying they just had deja vu. Then I whispered some poetry lines to an employee and he said ""god bless you"" 
It was a weird summer, manic forsure. But I am happy to be back to my normal life with my friends and family. I really took some steps backwards from my goals. And I despise really any spiritual reference now"

Family issues like that are rooted into the genes and you guys are likely dependent on the same chemicals, We all end up taking the path of least resistance in our lives.

Don't forget that monkeys burned dried up leaves that had chemicals that were supposed to kill bugs and viruses in the jungle. Taking certain chemicals can make co existing in our world easier"
