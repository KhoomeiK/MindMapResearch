You can still apply for Hispanic/LatinX scholarships though. You could also try applying to colleges and universities that work with Mayan populations like UTexas.

Antigua is known for its popularity with tourists and literally everyone speaks English there. Some places even accept dollars. It's honestly one of the most safest places in Guatemala.

If you're worried about the drive to Antigua dont be. A lot of the areas surrounding the airport in are bougie and expensive. I'm talking condos, townhomes, mansions, and gated communities all priced in dollars! 

Most importantly, I hope you have a good time.

I live in Illinois so  I can empathize with the shameless amount of harassment one has to endure in this type of urban setting. 
What works for me? 

1. Not taking the subway. I've noticed most scum are on the train. Is there a bus route you  can take? I personally feel safer on the bus because the driver is right there.

2. SUNGLASSES. The biggest ones you're comfortable with. If you need prescription sunglasses there's cheap ones online. It helps me feel confident and it hides my eyes so I can check out my surroundings. 

3. Shoes. I got steel toed boots for the colder weather from work and kicking someone with them hurts. 

4. Tools. Pepper spray. In my hands when I walk. 

5. If I'm on the subway and the creeps are trying to talk to me or just plain staring. I click the button on my headphones and pretend I'm on the phone. But waittttt don't  say ""hi honey"". I say things like ""I finished the autopsy and the report is on your desk"". People stop staring. 

People are plain ignorant. I injured my ankle recently so I have to wear an ankle brace and I have an ugly limp. I've noticed the harrasment has gone wayyyy done since this. Everybody is too busy staring at my brace to harass me now? 

I wish you the best. I hope something here in everybody's comments helps. Thanks again for sharing."
