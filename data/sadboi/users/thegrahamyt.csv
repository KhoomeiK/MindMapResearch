BPD,fho9ne7,t3_f3z7r4,1581746492.0,"I feel the same way. What gives me hope is that I've heard of people with severe BPD say that they have found ways to cope with their pain & still have a healthy relationship. Other people can care. People without bpd can truly care, we just think they don't. The right ones can care and will empathize. We shouldn't think this way...we can be capable. Our disorder is what it telling us we can't. Yes, we will always struggle because of what we have but that doesn't mean there isn't hope.  Stay strong you guys. It'll take effort, lots and lots of effort, but we can do it."

I'm sorry for what you're dealing with. I doubt you look as bad as you think."

BPD,fhimxg2,t1_fhgtdtq,1581627875.0,"I think that music repulsion/love is tied to BPD. In my case, my entire mood is affected by what kind of song and what the song is about.

I have a very strong appreciation for music yet it really does have a huge impact on my feelings"

BPD,f5o0asv,t1_f5nyylj,1572307208.0,"I think about suicide quite often. When I think about that happening, I get triggered and break down. He once broke up with me over my extreme drinking problem. I told him I would go to outpatient rehab, I did, and got sober. We got back together because I decided I'd go to treatment (only broke up for a few days). During those few days I felt very suicidal. I can't currently afford a therapist but I take medication. Ultimately, I think that I am too scared to commit. I know how I would do it, but I don't know if I would ever follow through. In that case, I'd seek help."
BPD,f5nh2kb,t3_docgl8,1572300131.0,"Yes. I've had urges and followed through with them before. Multiple times, with both romantic & platonic relationships. Now that I know I have BPD, I can identify the urges and ignore them. They go away. It's a cycle though. The urges come and go and honestly it's quite annoying. It's a defensive mechanism for sure. Sometimes I get mad at people and start to push them away, but I'm fortunate to have supportive friends and a boyfriend who understand why I do this. They reassure me & I'm doing better. It's so hard sometimes though."
BPD,f5neuaa,t3_do9vli,1572299384.0,Relatable. I have to force myself to work on my assignments instead of hangout with my fp (my boyfriend).

I'm not sure if you looked at the ""rating guidelines"" in their About section, but in my opinion, those guidelines are unrealistic and stupid. You've probably heard the generic saying, ""beauty is subjective."" Well, it's true. Unfortunately, some people are not going to find you attractive, but many will. The people on that sub are unrealistic and judgemental. You are a very good looking guy, and I mean that. You have great facial hair, big eyes, and a good face shape. Glasses are always cute on people and they fit your face shape. I'm sorry you got attacked. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you but I know it's hard with BDD."

In my experience, learning how to say sorry and meaning it makes me feel 10x better. I feel better almost instantly. Especially when I can be honest with myself when I'm the wrong during conflict. Not only does it help me, it helps the person I'm arguing with feel better and respected. We both cool down. It takes practice though...if you try this you will likely have a favorable outcome."

Most people dislike being roasted, but I think people with bpd should be cut some slack due to several of our symptoms. We truly are ""extra sensitive,"" we have intense emotions and unstable relationships. Being roasted can interfere with those relationships, especially if they don't understand the disorder or even try to empathize."

mentalhealth,ev8y1we,t3_cir68t,1564296361.0,"Your use of the words ""disturbing,"" ""scared,"" ""worrying"" etc make me think you're not a psychopath. A psychopath wouldn't feel disturbed, scared, or worried. They do not care that they are sick. They do not truly understand human emotions. 
If you were young and cried a lot, you are likely not a psychopath. In general, psychopathy is considered innate. On the other hand, people can develop sociopathy as they grow older. They're different things.
