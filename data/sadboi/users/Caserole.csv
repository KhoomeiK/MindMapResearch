Unfortunately with Sawada, those baristas are rolled into the ground with never ending lines out the doors. It jades a barista pretty quick. They deal with a lot. I know the whole staff there. The baby at that location is the ramen joint and the bAr at green street. Sawada is used to entertain guests while they wait so often it’s overlooked by management imo.

Progressed to all of us going to some weird underground Euro dance bar in the East Village that felt like a horror movie. He made me sit on his lap and proceeded to feel me up after I said no. So I was molested.

espresso,fmbqn1v,t1_fmapvmh,1585931423.0,"Ah ok if your hario slim isn’t modded to capture the spectrum of an espresso grind, that’s probably why 
:-( Its also not efficient because in order to slow extraction with a grind too coarse, you need to use a bunch of coffee. The recipe can exist around 18-20g in and 36-45g ish out around 20-30 +/- seconds. 

I have a hand grinder, Lido3, that can do espresso  but it’s SO annoying! I suggest Brevilles with the built in burr grinder or the Baratza. And proper distribution (making the bed of espresso flat with use of a finger without applying pressure) helps channeling.
