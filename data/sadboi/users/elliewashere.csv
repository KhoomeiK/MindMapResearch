Anxiety,fphy952,t1_fpczm69,1588630035.0,Here it is -- [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) \-- hope that helps.
CPTSD,fl2sgl2,t3_fm526a,1584758735.0,"I don't have advice, but I hear you and it's so hard. My loved ones are also over 70 and not taking good enough care of themselves, though they are American and privileged in a lot of ways. I'm feeling helpless, frustrated, resentful, anxious...and I imagine that when you've already been through extremely traumatic medical experiences, all of those feelings are tripled.

You are doing all you can: listening, loving, bearing witness. The anxiety of anticipated suffering is intense. I wish I could help more, but I hope feeling heard helps a little."
CPTSD,fl2s1ea,t3_fm6oqk,1584758435.0,"I'm a little like this too, the feeling of ""I should be fine but I'm not."" I chalk it up to ""brains are weird"". I tell myself that since I can't remember my childhood, it ""couldn't have been that bad,"" but I have trauma symptoms. This is partly because events that might not have been traumatic to others were traumatic to me, because everyone reacts differently to the same stimuli. At first that felt like a judgment on me but it's not; it's just the way I have experienced the world. A fact.

You are your own best ally. And your therapist. No one else's opinion or rating of you matters to your recovery. Learning to validate yourself can be so healing -- at least, it has been for me. Not having the ""right"" ACES score or fitting exactly into the DSM doesn't change the symptoms you struggle with. At first I was obsessed with both of these metrics because I really believe in science and psychology as validation. But over several years I've realized that having a label or number, or not having them, doesn't make me any more or less anxious, hypervigilant, sad, etc. I am those things no matter what the book says or where the symptoms came from. The most important thing is to treat my symptoms.

Also, I do believe that someday the DSM will catch up to what I know is true about childhood trauma. Psychology has existed in its current form, based in neuroscience, for what feels like a long time but is actually a fraction of human history. So it's taking a loooooong time to catch up to reality.

I hope that helps. Rooting for you."
secondary_survivors,fjy7ck3,t3_faj9c9,1583691295.0,"My mother was also raped when she was in her early twenties, and told me when I was a teenager. It is haunting. Trauma-informed therapy helped me... Being able to talk to someone who wasn't my mom, wasn't related to either of us, gave me space to have feelings so that I wasn't expecting my mother to help me process them. It has also helped me to journal. You are not alone in feeling alone and not knowing how to handle it."
CPTSD,fjoxgv7,t1_fjl0tcp,1583536904.0,"to be honest it just feels normal to me. but i appreciate the sympathy. it's nice to not feel alone, definitely."
CPTSD,fjja5gx,t1_fjilklm,1583387947.0,Oooh what book? I’m that weird person who loves trauma narratives.
CPTSD,fjja35c,t1_fjhvfo5,1583387886.0,I have done some research on service dogs for this too. They’re so expensive that I’m hesitant to even try to get one. But it would be amazing.
CPTSD,fjj9qt3,t3_fdhru9,1583387563.0,"I have this problem also. If I’m drying my hair I will take a break to check the hallway and front door. I leave the bathroom door open. If I vacuum I try to do it in the middle of the day when I know there are people around to hear if something happens to me. I also turn the vacuum off regularly because the noise bothers me and I don’t like not being able to hear my surroundings. I just try to be patient with myself and listen to my body’s anxiety signals. It helps me to know when I start the loud activity who else is in the house and where they are. It helps to have the front and back doors locked; sometimes I check them before I start something loud. If I have the dishwasher and dryer on at the same time, I try to sit where I can see the front door so noise won’t cover the sound of someone coming in. ...It’s nice not to be alone in this but I’m sorry you have the same worries/feelings I do."
Anxiety,fjb90jx,t1_fjb8fiz,1583188901.0,I'm glad to be able to help. Celexa messed me up too. What works depends on the person and the situation. I'm in the same frustrating boat. I hope things get better for you.
Anxiety,fjb1oc5,t3_fcclnx,1583184752.0,"Hey I just wanted to say that I hear you and I feel the same hopelessness. It has helped me to have trauma-informed therapy, and also to switch medications when one doesn't work. Maybe one or both of those things might help you.

The first thing I would do is ask to take a larger dose for six more weeks. If that doesn't work or you don't think it will help, ask to switch medications or supplement Prozac with something else for anxiety. The right meds can be transformative but it's a trial and error process. I wish you luck and peace. You are far from alone."
CPTSD,fiz968x,t3_fae9ij,1582857104.0,I am really glad you are still here and deeply impressed with your strength. It's wonderful that you're finding calm. Also wonderful that you've set boundaries with your mom. Wishing you continued peace.
CPTSD,firo0o3,t3_f9b03j,1582668030.0,"I feel the same way about money. I do depend on my emotionally abusive mother for car payments, and that helps even though it comes as an emotional price. But I am crazy about saving money because I don't feel safe. I also don't have friends and have difficulty using money that I set aside to be ""play"" money because I worry I might need it. Part of this comes from not feeling secure in my job; I have lost many because of anxiety. I also feel like Scrooge and am not sure what to do about it. For the record, I think you're pretty amazing to have saved all that money from 0."
rape,fi8fon8,t3_f6o3my,1582239420.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. Being kidnapped and raped is NOT your fault. When we're scared, humans often freeze. Just like animals do. That's probably why you couldn't scream on the bus; it's a natural reaction that just happens when we're in danger. Walking alone does not make any of it your fault. Not what you're wearing, not where you sat on the bus, none of it. It's the fault of those horrible men and I hope they're in prison forever.

All the reactions you're having of wanting to be alone, not wanting to talk about it, not wanting to be touched -- that's all very normal after being raped. You are not stupid or weird and however you react is okay.

I know since you don't want to talk about it, the thought of therapy might be really hard. That's okay too; there is no timeline. But it's important to know that there are ways to get help if you ever need it. People mention therapy because it can help survivors find healthy ways to cope with overwhelming feelings. As other people have mentioned, there's online chat therapy, [rainn.org](https://rainn.org) has resources for survivors, and here is a place to look up support groups in your area: [psychology today](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/614797920).

There are also other ways to help you heal, like trauma-sensitive yoga, that you might keep in mind for some future point. ...As you can tell, I like researching the internet for different ways to help myself, and I hope some of that research can help you, too.

You survived -- that's huge. I am really glad you have your mom to love and support you, and I hope you're able to keep leaning on her."
CPTSD,fi1b1pg,t3_f5tqgs,1582054185.0,"I work scheduling in a quiet office with little coworker interaction. It's ideal, though low pay and lack of benefits are NOT ideal. I'm looking into remote editing work. It's a struggle to find something that is financially secure and not triggering, I totally understand that."
CPTSD,fi1aroy,t1_fhznlzq,1582054031.0,"It's super frustrating to have those very different perspectives, I get that. My sisters both worship my mother. I'm the only one who ended up enmeshed, co-dependent, fucked up, whatever you want to call it. Even though I'm a twin; my twin is Kid B. My older sister is six years older and very much had a whole other life with our parents.

It's easy to feel alone in this kind of family dynamic, in my experience. But if therapy and this reddit forum has taught me anything, it's that we're (unfortunately) in a lot of company. I've found that the only way to feel comforted in this situation is to get validation from a therapist who I consider very smart. So they're likely to know about family dynamics and also I'm likely to believe what they say. Before I had that therapist, I just felt like I was The Crazy One in my family. Now I know that I'm not, even though I still struggle with the feeling.

Over time and after hard conversations with one of my sisters as she's entered therapy, I've realized that the family dynamics have caused them their own kinds of problems as adults. It's surprisingly cold comfort. And it still doesn't mean that we understand each others' experiences very well. That's a work in progress.

I hope this helps you feel less alone."
CPTSD,fhy1nb3,t3_f5b0cj,1581966671.0,"My first instinct is that you should set a goal to get out of there: after you get promoted, after you're there a year, or just after you find another job in the same field. You don't deserve to be pushed out, but truthfully it sounds too toxic to stay in long term. Your mental health is worth more than the job. Still, you should be able to use this as a stepping stone to a job in the same field considering how hard you've worked to get where you are.

There's another option too. Have you looked into workplace disability accommodations at all? Sometimes you can get a closed office to work in as an accommodation. You'd need a medical practitioner to sign off on it (possibly your therapist could). There's more information at the [Job Accommodation Network site](https://askjan.org/) that might help.

I hope you're able to make a change while keeping your career. I'm so impressed that you've worked to make this happen for yourself and that you're sticking it out while triggered AF and coming up with solutions."
CPTSD,fhy0k0c,t1_fhxhnjp,1581966048.0,That was the line that stuck with me the most from his book. So powerful.
CPTSD,fhktr6b,t3_f3r00p,1581691082.0,Thank you! I love them so much.
CPTSD,fhjucud,t3_f3cf2p,1581655858.0,"In trauma therapy the therapist explained to me that every parent-child relationship can be completely different, so kids end up with completely different perspectives on their parents. We all have roles in our families; kid A might be the kid who’s loved and grows up well-adjusted, but kid b is emotionally abused and gets cptsd. And kid C is older by five or more years, so they’re a separate “generation” of the family and then parenting can completely change between generations. Then you have 3 kids with what feels like three sets of parents. It’s super frustrating to be the kid worth CPTSD (hi)."
Anxiety,fhf8xua,t1_fc6qgfq,1581538609.0,"It sometimes hits me like this too. I've been taking it for years. But it doesn't \*usually\* hit me like this, so... maybe it depends on your level of anxiety before taking it."

CPTSD,fhd9bed,t3_f29xs2,1581480214.0,"As others have said, this is definitely a thing. It's common in Iraq among people with PTSD, according to this article (which is fascinating if you are interested in trauma and psychology): [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/31/magazine/iraq-mental-health.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/31/magazine/iraq-mental-health.html)"

CPTSD,fh8srst,t3_f1tj1t,1581366619.0,"I'm really impressed that you were able to tell him some of your story and also that you were able to feel strong emotion about it. That's great. It makes total sense to me that you would have a physical reaction to emotional vulnerability. I shake when I'm anxious, grind my teeth, have panic attacks; your body is basically doing the same thing, expressing itself in a way it knows how. I don't think that's shameful. It  seems natural. It also sounds like a phase that you have to get through to begin to cope with opening up. You probably have a therapist, but this is the kind of thing I go to therapy for: coping mechanisms for my coping mechanisms, if that makes sense. I hope that this gets better for you. Please don't listen to your mom's voice in your head. You are strong and brave."
CPTSD,fh8rpjj,t3_f1vd39,1581365998.0,"That's so touching that your mom realizes her mistake and was able to share it with you. I'm glad you had her to comfort you now, and I hope that helps heal the past for you."
CPTSD,fgxos97,t3_f0metp,1581175117.0,"Yes I have this too. It’s possible to violate your own boundaries and sometimes that’s what the feeling is for me after I share something. It’s also possible that your family was secretive and your brain still carries that “not supposed to tell” command into adulthood, even when it’s no longer applicable to a situation. And then there’s the general difficulty in trusting people and trusting our own judgment we have with CPTSD. These are the options a therapist once explained to me. The point is it’s definitely not just you. I think about this all the freaking time."
CPTSD,fgxo715,t1_fgtyh6u,1581174907.0,"Oh I didn’t mean therapy with her, I meant therapy for you. But as I also have this kind of problem with my mother, I know there are no easy answers. I hope you find a path forward that feels healing to you, even if that means not speaking to her. I am still figuring it out myself."
CPTSD,fgtvx60,t3_f0edqi,1581110092.0,"Remember your academic liberal friends are a VERY specific group of people with Rigid Feminist Feelings on shit like last names. As someone whose whole family is like this... it took a while to get that most people won't care or judge you, and more importantly, no one should. I'm so happy for you that you've found your family. Maybe the answer to this problem is to a) not mention it to your friends you think might disapprove, or b) just say something like, ""I'm so happy to claim X as a family name now that I have this wonderful extended family to support me, and I hope you can be happy for me too."" Maybe mention that this is symbolic to you. Academics love symbols, right? ;)

Also yay for happy family holidays/I love that whole father-and-stepmother backstory and how it all turned out okay :)."
CPTSD,fgtsrwf,t3_f0fkme,1581108881.0,This happened to me too. That feeling of being different but not knowing how. Then I found the right therapist and now I know.
CPTSD,fgtsoz9,t3_f0g194,1581108839.0,"Have you checked out the [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com) therapy filter? You can filter by religion and I this week I saw a couple of teletherapy options also. That's where I usually start. I look for phrases in their descriptions like ""evidence-based"" and ""scientific"" (which can be a challenge to find depending on where you are, but that's my current goal in finding a therapist). You also might try the ADAA therapist finder: [https://members.adaa.org/page/FATMain](https://members.adaa.org/page/FATMain). I hope you find someone good for you. It's a real struggle."
CPTSD,fgtqo7m,t3_f0d3ro,1581108116.0,that feeling of waiting for an attack is common for me too. it can be very hard. i empathize.

CPTSD,fgtpw1a,t3_f0g1c7,1581107763.0,"You matter. No one can tell you what choice to make, but also, it sounds like being around her is worse for you than not being around her. Having no contact with her is not your only option; you could have very low contact with her and set firm boundaries around what you will discuss and when and where you'll see here. For me it took a good therapist who specialized in attachment disorders and trauma to even start figuring out how to do this. I hope you can also find someone like this."
CPTSD,fgqqur9,t3_ezwtha,1581029553.0,I understand going back even though she's the source of so much of the bad shit. It's like a compulsion.

CPTSD,fg7fnzi,t3_exak8v,1580591356.0,I think the nurse was saying that it was the right thing to get medical attention and that you should be aware of those symptoms in the future so that you can get help before you're at the point of attempting suicide.

I have promised her I would always call medical people in a crisis, yeah. I need to build a support system outside of her in general. Also self-regulating is (obviously, since I have CPTSD) a great struggle for me, but I'm hoping that I can get back in therapy soon and maybe that will help. It gives me hope to know that other people have been through this and it's possible to heal the relationship. Thank you so much for sharing your story."
CPTSD,fg6p6pb,t1_fg6ny1h,1580573675.0,"It does help me to hear that. I think my sister and I developing better boundaries is key, and maybe things between us will get better over time. Thank you for sharing. It’s good to have hope."
CPTSD,fg6avkj,t3_ex2j9z,1580561899.0,"Pity your sister. She’s enmeshed and doesn’t know it. As someone who’s been that person and still struggles to find my way out of it with my parents even as an adult.... self sufficiency feels priceless to me. And very difficult because I‘ve had to develop the tools for it as an adult. I think you’re smart to be “the sane one,” to have made your own life. I can understand feeling resentment... but with my parents, all the money and smothering hasn’t made up for the emotional abandonment, either. If that’s true for your sister then the gestures from your parents are empty, and deep down she probably feels empty too. Be proud that you got out of that and are working on healing. That’s impressive to me."
CPTSD,fg6a416,t1_fg5la1g,1580561008.0,It’s a great idea and we have talked about it if we ever live in the same place again. But she’s across the country from me.

Already at the beginning of the story you were doing the smart things psychologists would tell you to do in a survival situation: comply to survive, get the kidnapper to see you as a person, prepare yourself emotionally as best you can. That's incredible that you were able to think about these things and do what you needed to do.

It is heartbreaking that you think of yourself, as you said, as a ""worthless person."" You are clearly incredibly brave and capable. And you're \*still here.\* That seems huge to me. I'm a person who struggles with depression even with most things going great in my life, while you've been through this terrible ordeal and you're here to write about it.

I listen to music and sing along to distract myself while I clean; doing the dishes or scrubbing the kitchen counter helps. Or organizing my closet. I take my ativan, two if it's an emergency. Sometimes I try the four counts in five counts out breaths that a therapist taught me. Or take a deep breath and scan my body for the signs of tension - jaw clenching, tight muscles, fidgeting - and I try to relax all of it.

Anxiety,fenrc12,t1_fenimx5,1579289688.0,"Hey u/eleomena, sure no problem. So I worked at the reference desk where people could come up and ask you questions, like ""I need a book on 19th century archaeology,"" and you had to find the right database in the library website, then use the right keywords to give them some options, then help them track down the book in the stacks. The triggers were a combination of things: having hundreds of databases on different subjects to chose from, and not remembering which was for best for what question; being under a time limit with a sometimes-annoyed patron waiting for the right answer; not always knowing from their question what keywords to use, so my search wasn't accurate. In library school they train you to ""interview"" the patron to find out details about what they need so your search is easier, but I would freeze up and not know what to ask them. When your mind goes blank with panic just by someone walking up, all the research steps become almost impossible to fumble through.

2 contrasting stories:

1. in my previous work at libraries checking in and out items, it was lower pressure and I was ultimately fine. In the beginning, I carefully wrote down and learned each step of the process and then had bosses who were okay with my learning curve. I also had no problem shelving (solitary) or doing admin stuff on the computer (also solitary).

2. At a corporate research job where I could do extensive database research on my own and then come to the client with answers in more time, I excelled. So I know the time pressure was a big part of the problem. I also have anxiety about timed tests.

I hope that helps. Not all library jobs are reference librarian jobs."

From reading your explanation it seems like you're being really hard on yourself. You're not a monster. You're responding in a normal way to abnormal stuff, like your mom being sick. You're still here and you have this relationship with your mom even though it's hard. It seems important to you that you're there for her, and it sounds like you are even when you're going through a lot yourself, which to me sounds like strength and kindness and compassion, even when it doesn't feel like it to you. It's okay to be ""really losing it"" right now; you don't have the mental energy for ""every single healthy thing,"" and no one should expect you to while your mom is sick. I hope your therapist is a good support system and I'm glad they're reminding you that you're doing the best you can."

rape,febjjh4,t3_em0zwm,1578959470.0,"Hey, I'm so sorry this happened to you. I would agree with the poster above who said you might have been drugged. It sounds like Alexis might have been also, unless she's covering up for her husband. Very shady and awful. It's natural to feel confused and even guilty but it is not your fault and I think you've been very strong to even talk to people about it to try to figure out what happened.

You mentioned not having therapy/resources in the area. Is there a way you can access the [RAINN.org](https://RAINN.org)  website? They have a live chat and a phone line you can call. I hope you're able to get support."
Anxiety,febh6rw,t1_feb4us5,1578958741.0,Thank you so much for responding. I'm so mad that that happened to you and I hope you're doing okay. Also I'm selfishly glad to not be the only one with job anxiety. Thank you for the encouragement - I will keep trying.
Anxiety,feay4gf,t1_fead68o,1578953422.0,THIS.
Anxiety,feaeewh,t3_eo9mwp,1578947654.0,I'm happy for you.
Anxiety,feae2y6,t3_eo8ep9,1578947465.0,"I am so impressed by your perseverance and grit. Good for you!! Huge congratulations.

(Disclaimer:  I'm sure you know all about this stuff having gone through a lot of anxiety already, but I wanted to give you a heads up in case you don't know about these resources.) When I was in college the disability services office helped me with my anxiety; I worked on time management and study skills with them, and they were great for emotional support. This was even without official accommodations for anxiety as a disability (which I didn't realize I qualified for, and it sounds like you would too). I hope your school has these resources if you want them. Most schools are required to in the U.S. I believe.

Unrelated -- I hope that your college experience is wonderful. YOU'RE DOING IT! GOOD FOR YOU!"
CPTSD,fdm4u3c,t1_fdlccp3,1578539824.0,"Wow, that is really cool that they're resurfacing. I mean, cool in the sense that the brain is amazing, not cool about the childhood trauma. I have almost no memories of my life until I left for college and only some memories of my 20s.  I can't figure out if they don't exist or are repressed. Your story gives me hope that they do exist. And I'm glad at 65 that you're in a healthier mental place."
rape,fdirnqq,t3_elftyf,1578449514.0,"I'm so sorry they've reacted this way and that this happened to you at all. Your friends may not be the right people to turn to; they're young and probably don't know what is appropriate, or are, frankly, too self-absorbed to care. Which SUCKS and I've been there. It sounds like this is really bothering you and you value them though, so maybe it's too soon to give up on them. You might consider sitting them down and having a very clear conversation about what you need: do not bring X up in conversation, when I have a panic attack or X happens I need this from you, etc. Then you could let them know that if they can't do that, you need to spend less time with them, spend time with them only in X situation, etc. Your needs have to come first because you are the one going through shit.

Or, maybe the answer here is to change your boundaries and skip right to spending less time with them. That's probably not what you want to hear because no one wants to lose friends. But you will find that real, true friends who are going to be in your long term are people who will continue to try to respect and be aware of your needs and history. Sometimes people fail at this stuff, because people are imperfect and life is messy, but it's important that you surround yourself with people who \*keep trying\* to be supportive.

I am also working on trying to find a new group of friends, and I've started with looking for groups of people who understand trauma -- like trauma-informed yoga, women's support groups attached to churches or hospitals, even looking at a nondenominational church that advertises themselves as open to LGBTQ, which is usually code for ""relatively woke"" (as much as I believe that exists in religious organizations). I think part of the key is finding physical spaces where people who've been through shit go. Even craft groups sometimes work. You might also check out resources from [rainn.org](https://rainn.org/), which might have location-based info. Obviously support groups are not friends, at least not at first, but it's a place to start.

I hope this helps. Teenagers are assholes. And you are not alone."
rape,fdihs7q,t3_elds4i,1578443214.0,"This is not your fault. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I would start with your parents as u/hanjay09 said, if you feel it's safe to tell one of them. If not them, is there a [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) you can get to near you? Or just call? They might be able to help you with abortion costs, or at least walk you through your options. Or what about calling RAINN? They have a lot of resources online and also a hotline. Their number: is800.656.HOPE (4673) and here's [a page on how calling them works](https://rainn.org/about-national-sexual-assault-telephone-hotline?_ga=2.13884913.77453658.1578442895-1076515759.1578442895). Another option is [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/), for suicidality specifically in the LGBTQ community.

Please don't die. We need you in the world. 17 is too young to give up -- so much time for things to get better. You've already taken a big step by telling your story here. Please keep us updated. Rooting for you."
CPTSD,fdih277,t3_eljjr9,1578442745.0,Good for you!!
CPTSD,fdigea6,t1_fdif8f0,1578442312.0,"Thank you so much for responding and for the sympathy. I read that line about persistence and had to reread what I'd written to even see it. I'm glad you see that in me and I hope it keeps working. And I hope you're able to do something cool with your academic potential. Somebody should ;).

The grocery store was, honestly, a decision made totally based in depression: why try. Which is actually funny (ironic or something - not funny haha) because there are much worse jobs. A lot of grocery store jobs are pretty good for a lot people and some have benefits. But the thing that terrified me about it was actually that I couldn't remember enough to scan items in a particular way, and the bright lights and music playing and people everywhere triggered an anxiety overload. I think stocking would be better if I'd had to do it longer (in case you're ever in need of a grocery store job, :)).

Tangent! Anyway. Thanks for encouraging me."
CPTSD,fdhrbmc,t3_elg1nh,1578428650.0,"I don't think it's a wrong or right thing, just how you are right now. It might change as you heal; therapy has helped me with it a little. The hardest part about it for me is trying to accept it without self-hatred. Give yourself grace. You can't help being how you are, it's not your fault, and it does have a good side. Like you said, you make people laugh. Some people will love you more for the way you are."
service_dogs,fdhmahh,t1_fdhcqnm,1578425662.0,I appreciate you doing what you can. As a person over here trying to get through the day with an invisible disability.
service_dogs,fdgxcqs,t1_fdfxdzf,1578410648.0,Thank you so so much for all the details. I’ll use it all for my research. I hadn’t even thought about the duvet or washing the blanket — so good to know! Solidarity from over here.
service_dogs,fdgx800,t1_fdgpe8b,1578410556.0,"I think it’s pretty normal as a family member to feel like it’s all on you and you’re never doing enough. It’s just not the truth. You do what you can. No stigma would be great, yes. Maybe someday."

service_dogs,fdfqnp6,t1_fd9h7gp,1578367866.0,"Mostly unrelated, as a person who is in the process of trying all the things before I start saving for a service dog... What kind of weighted blanket do you have? Also is SAAD lighting a special lightbulb or the lamp itself? I've been trying to figure out what kind to get for both these things.

Go you with the meditation. I find it so difficult."
Anxiety,fdfouk7,t1_fdfe4eb,1578366670.0,"That's so cool that you like coding! It triggers my anxiety so much that I could barely get through a Python class. I like editing website content and HTML, but I don't think I could learn JavaScript to be a webmaster because, again, coding. As for what I'd like... my dream was to be a systems librarian at a university somewhere I wouldn't have to be faculty/do research. But because of the school thing and how stressful an academic library was in grad school, now I'm leaning toward something in a learning center or with disability somehow. No idea what yet and I don't think I'm super qualified. I'm with you though, it's more about the environment than anything else. I just know I really like fixing broken website links and printers, so that's how I started leaning toward IT.

Maybe you could take one class while working...? I feel you, the juggling is hard and it's also hard to know where to start. I hope the new job is good and not awful. Fingers crossed!

Funny that you were a page -- I was working in a library as a circ assistant before grad school. Turns out it's totally different from actual librarianship, who knew. Definitely not worth sacrificing yourself for. At all."

Anxiety,fdf1ted,t1_fdf0iwe,1578351375.0,"I really hope your meds kick in and things get better. Meds have helped me keep my head above water lately. They're not enough but they're something.

That's so cool that your husband is in IT. That was what I just tried to go back to school for, before dropping out because my depression was terrible and I was failing. I do want to incorporate my MLIS with an IT degree and change directions into the for-profit sector -- sounds so good, right? -- but my mental health is too much to handle. I'm really glad you're able to transfer credits and get another bachelor's. You can do it!! Cheering for you over here. That's impressive.

...Is it bad that my first reaction to $10-15K in debt was ""Oh, only that much?"" Because it was. After a certain point it all just feels like, what the hell, why not go for more. But seriously I'm glad you found something new.

Gotta go slow or I'll get swamped and mess it all up again.

*I'm disappointed, this was meant to be ""the answer"" but it's been hell.*

Oh god do I feel this. Also, substance abuse, seriously?? Man people did NOT talk about this shit in grad school. I am really glad to feel less alone over it. And glad you're able to get out."

That's great that the doctors were able to figure out what's wrong and help you. Second -- shit, man, this is awful and I'm so sorry. I can hear how tired and discouraged you are. Maybe it doesn't mean much from an internet stranger, but I am sending you support and I hope that with your team on your side, things will start to get better. You are badass for pushing through this even though it's so hard."
Anxiety,fdet7f6,t1_fdecbdz,1578346100.0,"I also have a library degree. But I was so anxious while working the desk at an academic library that I now, several months post-grad, am in a temp admin job and I don't know what I'll do. I'm too depressed (clinically, not as an expression) to go back to school. And tired from two years of it. If you don't mind talking about it, what's your backup plan? I'm glad to not be the only one to find librarianship super stressful though I am sorry you're also feeling the anxiety of it."
CPTSD,fdess4l,t3_ekz1od,1578345850.0,That sounds like such a beautiful healing time. I'm so glad you had it.
