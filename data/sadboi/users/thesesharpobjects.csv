To help this, I ordered a bunch of paint and craft stuff to do with the two year old and try to keep myself focused on little “projects” like going through my clothes and stuff like that so I feel like I’m accomplishing something still.

When she’s being an absolute gremlin I think “WOW no idea where that feeling came from but no more” I had a high risk pregnancy and ppd so I’m just done.

She’s only 2 but so far I love the way our family is now. Me, baby, her dad, and kitties all mesh well and fit nicely on my queen sized bed. I feel like I can give her my attention without feeling burnt out (doubt this would be the case with multiples), we’ve been able to save money and the grandparents are also more than willing to take one grandbaby as opposed to three. Also, I have zero desire to do the baby thing all over again. The way I see it, for the rest of my life I’m going to get to love on OTHER PEOPLES babies all the time. Cousins, friends, family will all probably have babies I’ll be able to play with that will keep my baby fever at bay."

Parenting,fojm0dq,t3_g7szlm,1587824319.0,"I don’t know your husband, but when my daughter was born my SO was very new to childcare. I really wanted him to just DO things, without me having to ask but he needed me to tell him step by step what to do. It was mostly his new dad nerves as he hadn’t really gotten into his “dad mode” yet. It was pretty much the same thing though. They didn’t really have much of a connection at all until she was maybe 6 months old and a little more independent and it was more playing instead of non stop feeding/diaper/sleeping newborn routine. Tell him to keep trying! I fully believe women become mothers during pregnancy but men become fathers after birth. My daughter is 2 now and her daddy is her entire world, and she is his. There’s some days I sit here and want to cry because their bond makes me so happy. I think he just needs practice and some time."

I’m not judging you for any of that BUT what I came here to say is it’s something you should probably really think about. One day your child will be old enough and smart enough to realize you would rather not have them around, which is an incredibly painful and damaging thing for a child. I understand patenting is hard but it’s something to keep in mind as your raise your child. In the meantime, try to keep your sanity, and maybe offer your friend a decent amount of extra money?"

From week 20 on I had weekly ultrasounds and visits to my doctor. At the end of ever milestone (24 weeks, baby is viable, 32 weeks and I wouldn’t have to give birth at a hospital in the city) I would be so relieved because I was told I could lose my baby at any time. I gave birth a month early and my doctor said my next pregnancy would most likely be extremely high risk as well.

Now that she understands words just a little better, I tell her I’m having a ‘caca day’ (caca in our house means no good, poopy, bad). She doesn’t ask a lot of questions yet but I always wonder when that day will come. I plan on being open about my mental state with her, but I also don’t want her to feel like she can’t rely on me because of it. I hope every day that my illness doesn’t affect her happiness but I feel it’s unavoidable at times and it makes me feel awful. I’m on medications now that have *thankfully* made me the most stable I’ve been in my life so I’m hoping things keep getting better. Being bipolar and a parent is no walk in the park."

ADHD,ff7i4h6,t3_eryjl3,1579650085.0,I love cooking and food quite a lot but I tend to get super overwhelmed very quickly if I’m making multiple things. I’m also notorious in my house for burning the shit out of the garlic bread every. single. time
ADHD,ff71143,t1_ff701l6,1579638982.0,"20mg to start, I had a med review at the end of the month and they may move me up. I didn’t feel a whole lot different, but I felt it peak after about 3 hours. It’s supposed to last around 8 hours but I feel it’s worn off around 6-7 hours for me personally. It doesn’t  work as well as I would like so I’m going to see if they can up it just a little."
ADHD,ff6vnwc,t1_ff6ttna,1579635826.0,Thank you for the advice! When I went into the pharmacy that could order them it still took nearly a week for them to come in so this is a great option!

Most pharmacies refused to even order it for me, I went around to 4 different pharmacies before I found one that was able to order my script and I still felt like I was being judged by the pharmacists because of the stigma around ADHD medication."

Anxiety,ff6hanv,t3_ervufa,1579627185.0,"I talk to myself “thesesharpobjects you need to relax, everything is fine” and if I’m at home I’ll literally walk around my house and find something to do, like cleaning or organizing something, literally anything else I can focus on. In public it’s a bit harder. I still talk to myself quietly and try to go somewhere private to ground myself"
ADHD,ff6h38a,t3_erxddg,1579627057.0,"Congrats! My first day on meds (Ritalin SR) was yesterday and WOW. I can finally finish a chore without starting another, I can actually listen and comprehend things people are talking to me about instead of my brain just going somewhere else. School today was also a breeze! I had a 4 hour class that I was worried about staying focused in and I was fine! I’m glad to hear someone else’s life is improving too."

Cons: area has become popular to move to the past 5 or so years so the traffic/people/housing has gotten insane, plus they keep building more. Oh, and the roads. 

So in conclusion, don’t move here"
AmItheAsshole,fehb5it,t3_ep1qtx,1579112932.0,"ESH-your pregnant wife is on bed rest and pregnant, which are two super sucky things (I would know) so cut her slack but I do agree that’s a lot of money with a baby on the way you’re probably trying to save money for. I would try and form a compromise, such as buy water in big jugs and get her a cute reusable metal cup (it was also keep her water cold) and wastes a lot less plastic but she also doesn’t have to drink tap water. I would suggest this to her but if she fights you over it I would wait and bring it up again once things are more stable in a couple of months. Good luck to you guys!"

BipolarReddit,fdhqjyc,t3_eldhfz,1578428205.0,"I didn’t know I was bipolar until after I had my daughter. I won’t lie, when I found out I sat there and wondered “if I could take it back, would I chose NOT to have her?” And I’ve thought about it and given myself some honest answers. I know in my heart 100% my child is the best thing in my life. Yes, I have my mental health issues and my SO helps when I get extremely overwhelmed or moody (medicated now which is helping) but I still have bad days. I try to explain to my daughter how I’m feeling that day in the simplest of terms “mommy is sad today” or “mommy is tired” because I believe I should be open with my child about emotions and feelings. I’m absolutely scared she may have bipolar as well but I have no way of knowing until down the road. In my opinion, if a child is something you really want in your life and have the means to work REALLY hard at dealing with your mental health, I say go for it. You’ll have good days and you’ll have bad days but the reward is so huge."
