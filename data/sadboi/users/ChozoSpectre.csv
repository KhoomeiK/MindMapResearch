psychnursing,fplnnl0,t3_ge6cm0,1588716011.0,"Ive been in psych for a few years now and I really love it.   It can be really rewarding seeing people become themselves again and it's always exciting. That being said you see and hear about a lot of horrible stuff.  You need to be able to separate work from home or you'll burn out really fast.  (Like with any nursing really)
You could always pick up a prn psych job to see what you think! :)"
