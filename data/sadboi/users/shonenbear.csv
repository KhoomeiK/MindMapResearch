WoT,fqz0wkq,t3_glnltr,1589757929.0,"I totes agree.   I liked this whole arc.   Perrin is desperately in love with Faile and is will to do anything to get her back and just focuses on that to the detriment of the camp, Masema and everything else.   

Thae payoff was amazing. 

Plus I loved Faile's POV as well.  Her not knowing who to trust.  Having everyone pledge allegiance to her and feeling responsible for them.  Putting up with Galina and the Aiel who wanted to sleep with her, forgot his name at present.   Plus her trying not to get caught by Sevana.  

This whole story line was so much better than Elayne securing the throne.   That should've been two chapters max."

Happy I'm not the only one who loves Perrin and Faile.  I like they're relationship and I understand that she grew up in the royal household and is of a different culture so the things she expects are different from what Perrin has ever known.  

And I tolerate Elayne.  I mean I guess I do like her character but she's a chore sometimes.   But I try to chalk that up to growing up the daughter heir and being privileged.   

The Aeil are awesome.   Love them so much.  

Yeah.  The Foresaken are a bit underwhelming at the moment.   They get better/more evil later.  

And just keep enjoying the series.   I just started the Dragon Reborn for the umpteenth time.

I'm an atheist and used to really struggle with the Higher Power aspect but I wanted to be able to honestly say I had a Higher Power and after much thought and deliberation I came up with Mother Nature.   I is far larger than myself, I can't manipulate, I have no control over it and when I'm in nature I'm at peace and happy."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fo5jacy,t3_g5p7q6,1587527018.0,"Okay.  Thanks for your honesty.   I know this was hard for you.   I'm really thinking you may need to get into a detox facility as if you have become physically addicted to the alcohol it can be extremely dangerous to quit cold Turkey or even to cut back.  If the detox is associated with a rehab then I'm begging you to transition to the rehab for 30, 60 or 90 days to give your body and mind a chance to start getting back to baseline again.  

Addiction is a horrific disease that destroys everything in its path.  

Please check out county or state resources.   If you have insurance talk to them as well to see how they can help you.   

In the meantime online 12 step meetings may help give you some support, education and may have additional resources.   

And forgive yourself.   We don't go into addiction with the plan of becoming hopeless addicts we often start using because we're unhappy with something in our lives and things get out of control.   

You found an amazing subreddit.   We're all here for you.   And if no one told you this today.  I love you and think you're worth it.  

Good luck my friend."
WoT,fnv1bxi,t1_fnv0ifa,1587277060.0,"I don't know that Youtuber but I don't want any of the Foresaken cut.  And Samuel was pretty cool but I guess I get stuck with thinking he's just got little man syndrome,  but I do love that he never healed his scar and kept it as a reminder.   

I like that he and Graendal we like best frenemies for a while.  

Like I think Meseena is just a waste.  I mean she's got the black ajah in the tower and still doesn't get shit done.   Samuel,  Ravhin and Demandred all took over countries.   Graendal had her hand in the pot as well.  Moggy was waiting in the shadows but at least we get a little of her with the black ajah.   Sermy is also completely interesting but we don't get much until Rand kills her.  But she was super coo coo bananas.   And when I read her POV's I always think of Grace Jones.  Beautiful and deadly.   

Anyway this has been a good conversation.   I love these books."

So happy you love Perrin and Faile.  I always loved them and  I know they get a lot of crap but they're still awesome.  I love that Faile loves Perrin so much that she just wants him to be all he can be.  And yes their relationship is somewhat flawed but who's isn't? I've been married for 30 years and our relationship works but people on the outside may not get it.  

And yes the Foresaken should've had more play along with Paden Fain.  I'm somewhat obsessed with the Foresaken and Graendal is my favorite.   But Demandred's crazy jealousy and hatred are pretty cool.

You are reading the series very differently than I did.  Normally I am someone who figures out things quickly in movies, TV shows, books and what have you and I'm almost never surprised.   But with this series, which I had heard about, I decided to turn off that part of my brain and just try to be surprised and see how things play out instead of forward thinking and guessing.   And it was nice to see the story unfold and I was pleasantly surprised several times.  

And I love how Jordan does so much Foreshadowing in the books that most people don't ever notice in their first read through but it becomes so much more obvious on your second,  third, fourth and fifth read through.   

Anyway enjoy your read and give us more guesses later."

And its funny that I hated NyNaeve as much as Matt through a lot of the books on my first read through.   I've since grown to love her.  And her burn on Lan in the later books is fabulous.

This is just my story.  

There are still to this day more than 30 states in this country where the LGBT community can  legally be discriminated against with no legal recourse.
