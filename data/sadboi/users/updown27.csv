relationship_advice,fr3cfyr,t3_gmbud9,1589854422.0,Y‚Äôall lose your right to advice when you date someone over 10 years older than you.
Advice,fr2g4k9,t3_gm59rl,1589836697.0,The only reasons therapist can break confidentiality is if they believe someone is going to hurt themself or someone else. Having a sexual attraction to children after being sexually assaulted as a child does not in itself indicate that one is going to cause harm or assault anyone. However it becomes increasingly likely the longer he goes without help. If he has not committed a crime he cannot go to jail for having sexual thoughts. The worst case scenario would be a mental health facility and that would only be possible if he was making distinct plans to hurt someone. You can‚Äôt just lock people up for having thoughts and the sooner he can get help for this the better. I know it‚Äôs really really scary to talk about but he deserves a happy healthy and safe life and he CAN overcome this. This is the result of trauma that has informed his sexual preferences. He may have to look around and try a few therapists to find the right one but it will be worth it if he can save another life by doing it. Look for a therapist who specializes in sexual trauma. I can guarantee they will have heard this story before.

ADHD,fr2ek9f,t3_gm2r6y,1589835909.0,"As someone with ADHD who has given this exact advice recently I‚Äôd just like to say that if I‚Äôm sharing my bedtime routine with someone it is in no way to indicate that that routine will work for everyone or that it is easy to accomplish. There are many nights when that routine just doesn‚Äôt go off but I have found what works for me and if I can make it happen then I can sleep properly. The alternative is extremely unhealthy for me and triggers other disorders that I have. 90% of you admit to never having even tried this technique and that‚Äôs fine but don‚Äôt complain about problems your not willing to work on fixing. Like I said it‚Äôs NOT easy, it‚Äôs actually extremely difficult and doesn‚Äôt always work and is different for everyone what will work but if you‚Äôre not willing to try something new you are going to keep getting the same results. Besides, what other advice is there?? What are you going to do? Knock yourself unconscious every night? Either learn to make changes in your life or stop asking for advice that doesn‚Äôt exist."

I also take medication that helps me sleep and there are several over the counter options for that (meaning you don‚Äôt need a prescription just pick it up at the drug store). I also recommend journaling before bed and using noise cancelling headphones with relaxing sound/audiobooks/music to get your mind off everything. Good luck!

Best thing you can do is replace the habit with something else or change the routines associated with smoking so that it is no longer convenient to smoke at those times. If you are going to relapse, avoid buying an entire pack of cigarettes. I used nicotine gum to fix cravings and then I would get a disposable vape pen for nights out (my biggest trigger) so I wouldn‚Äôt wake up in the morning with a half pack of cigarettes and a sore throat. Also avoid triggers if you can. People say to only quit one thing at a time but that never worked for me. Alcohol and socializing to this day is still my biggest trigger. I stopped drinking for almost a year and it helped a ton with breaking my nicotine addiction. Last thing is place reminders of your motivators. Clean out your car, enjoy how good your hair smells when you haven‚Äôt been smoking, etc. Good luck!"

askwomenadvice,fpkdw6w,t3_gdxb1u,1588692902.0,"You‚Äôre discovering the thread of misogyny and toxic masculinity that holds our society together. I was 29 or 30 when that all became clear to me. It felt like my world was crumbling around me. I don‚Äôt hate men, though. I can see more clearly now a man who is not worth my time, or even dangerous to be around. And I don‚Äôt give any chances. Personally I have not found a cis man worth my time since this all happened. But I don‚Äôt hate them. Because they are victims of this problem too. This superiority complex, this alpha male competition, this requirement to subjugate women, lgbtq, POC, etc, is an essential part of how we are ALL raised and how our beliefs and brain function are formed. Even for those who are conscious of this bias and find it abhorrent and do everything in their power to fight against it will still fall victim because it is inherent in our culture.  This means that men, despite their best effort to the contrary (and often there is no effort at all), are socially conditioned to be abusive, to assault others, to take what ‚Äúbelongs to them‚Äù, to hold on to their dignity by not allowing rejection as an option. Men who make rape jokes are painfully insecure. They hold on with a tight grasp to anything that might makes them feel ‚Äúworthy‚Äù as a man. I don‚Äôt pity them. But I recognize that they have been conditioned to dominate as much as women are conditioned to accept it. And they will have to suffer the knowledge that they have been monstrous until they die. You can‚Äôt undo a rape. You can‚Äôt apologize it away. And men could spend decades thinking it‚Äôs not that big a deal before they realize how many lives they have destroyed - if the ever do at all. There are even plenty of women who think rape is funny and victims were asking for it and they‚Äôre liars and they exist solely to serve men‚Äôs desires. It‚Äôs not exclusive to men it‚Äôs just more obvious in them. Still though I prefer hanging out with people who are on my level of awareness on this matter. I‚Äôll let you know if I ever find a cis man that meets that qualification lol.

TLDR: we are all victims of our toxically masculine culture."

Obviously I don‚Äôt know this guy so that may not be the case at all, but people don‚Äôt usually take their kids and just outright leave IN SECRET because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbored‚Äù."

EatingDisorders,fpio9cl,t3_gdo5tv,1588645080.0,"Tell her what you said here and arrange a certain day and time to check in with your mom about this. It could be weekly, every other week, or monthly; whatever is appropriate for you, but you will ONLY discuss it at that predetermined time. This allows your mom to feel ‚Äúin the loop‚Äù about your health and safety and it allows you an opportunity to seek support from her if you need it. It also will help you get more comfortable acknowledging what happened while relieving the constant fear of her springing this scary conversation on you at any moment. Remember that developing an eating disorder is nothing to be ashamed of. It is an illness and you deserve compassion, support and respect from your mom and from yourself. Good luck!"

ACPocketCamp,fpinkvp,t1_fpibpa2,1588644659.0,Not really cause if you only give them 2 bugs I really don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre gonna meet any goals with that. As long as it says ‚Äúwants‚Äù then they need that type. The chances that you are hitting them on their very last bug is unlikely since it only happens once per round.
harrypotter,fpibacv,t3_gcgmys,1588637386.0,Hermione‚Äôs parents were dentists. She probably already had a sense of Latin and how it is used in medicine. Also if she shared any of this with her parents they could have been very helpful in that sense.

ACPocketCamp,fpi8inb,t3_g8sqwy,1588635791.0,"I sell for max price for two reasons. One, I know the buyer will receive 15x what they paid for them even at max price when giving to a camper, not to mention the bonus goods. And two, because I don‚Äôt have time to price out all my goods. They are either minimum or maximum and I base that on supply-demand."
ACPocketCamp,fpi7u35,t3_gdmr3h,1588635404.0,All the time. I feel like a lot of people dying their hair and shaving their heads in quarantine could benefit from this specific aspect of the game lol. It feels ssooo good to put on something new that fits my mood!
CatAdvice,fpi6ff5,t3_gdm60v,1588634593.0,Make sure the vacuum is set as low to the ground as possible. There‚Äôs usually a knob at the bottom.
ACPocketCamp,fpi2p3v,t1_fpgtz9y,1588632485.0,"Yeah I don‚Äôt blame people for not realizing. Also, a lot of people who play are kids, you can‚Äôt expect them to realize. But, I also don‚Äôt feel bad unfriending someone who doesn‚Äôt benefit my game. There are so many players, no one will ever be short on friends."
ACPocketCamp,fpi279z,t1_fphtwak,1588632211.0,Same. I save them until I can dump them all on 2 or 3 people. I hate getting (and also wasting my time giving) just a couple at a time. I think it pays better to do more at once too but I‚Äôm not sure.
ACPocketCamp,fpi1z2a,t1_fph2bah,1588632082.0,I‚Äôve got 80 purple and orange on hold. I don‚Äôt give them out until people need them. Some people won‚Äôt even get that far if they don‚Äôt get enough silver and gold first.
askwomenadvice,fpgooy4,t3_gda16y,1588606734.0,If she doesn‚Äôt reach out to you then you don‚Äôt have to do anything. On the rare occasion she does call or text just ignore it.

EatingDisorders,fpg6628,t3_gd8puz,1588595352.0,"First of all, you are doing amazing! Bumps like this are totally normal and the fact that you‚Äôre aware of the symptoms and warning signs you‚Äôre showing is ideal. Second, throw that scale away, my friend. And cover your mirror. Those behaviors are just ways of checking in with ED and you don‚Äôt need that in your life. Try replacing body checking with journaling, making art, singing, dancing, something that makes you feel I innately valuable. Good luck! You‚Äôre doing great! Keep going!"
askwomenadvice,fpet2iu,t3_gd1a23,1588554333.0,"I like the idea of therapy. I can‚Äôt really put myself in your position but I can tell you this, relationships are not all fun and games. Everyone shows off the happy moments but behind those are just as many challenging ones you never see. You‚Äôve never experienced it so you wouldn‚Äôt be able to know how difficult it can be sometimes. That doesn‚Äôt negate your desire to experience love. That‚Äôs really important and valid and if you are having trouble meeting that goal in life therapy can probably help as well as helping you navigate those tough moments with your friends.

Edit: oh I know! Go watch ‚ÄúA marriage Story‚Äù with Adam Driver. That‚Äôs an accurate representation of ‚Äúthe bad side‚Äù of relationships. I could barely get through it."
EatingDisorders,fpera14,t3_gd117u,1588553255.0,"Get a dietitian. If that is absolutely impossible, a typical meal plan might look like this:

\*Disclaimer: this meal plan is designed for me (31F) specifically and is intended for weight maintenance given a mild-moderate level of exercise. Your gf's nutritional needs could differ.  I strongly urge you to encourage her to seek professional help as soon as possible.

Breakfast: 1 protein, 1 grain, 1 fat, 1 fruit

Snack: 1 protein or fat, 1 grain or fruit

Lunch: 2 protein, 2 grain, 2 fat, 1-2 fruit/veg

Snack

Dinner: 3 protein, 1-2 grain, 2 fat, 1-2 fruit /veg

Dessert: Same as snack but make it fun

Each meal/snack should be no more than 2-3 hours apart

1 serving protein is 1 oz or for example, 1 egg or 1 thick slice of lunch meat. 3 oz is, generally, the size of her fist, so like a chicken breast or thigh at dinner would be all 3 protein servings.

1 serving of grain is about 15 grams. For example, 1/2 cup cooked rice or one slice of bread.

1 serving of fat is typically 1 tbsp. Examples: dressing, butter, sour cream

1 serving of fruit/veg is typically 1/4 cupped cooked and 1/2 cup raw (or like one whole banana, one whole apple, etc.)

Please note: It is absolutely above and beyond to expect you to create a meal plan without any experience or education in nutritional health. I suspect this meal plan will cause her physical discomfort and you may want to encourage her to use distress tolerance skills after to avoid purging (eg. distraction, not exercise related, such as: cleaning, games, conversation, tv, blankies, scented lotion, etc). If you want to use recovery rules then the bathroom is used prior to eating and not until 1/2 hour after. Again, it is not your job to be her dietitian and therapist and could cause problems in your relationship if you try to manage this without help long-term. Best of luck to you both.

PS mods I hope the numbers in this are within the guidelines. I apologize if this is inappropriate."
