modsbeingdicks,fr4560t,t1_fr44mbk,1589876181.0,"Really the only thing you can do that's constructive is just moderate. Personally, and I think many people share this opinion, but I have major respect for moderators who aren't dicks or do asshole things. It's someone who's a very small step above the rest of us, but someone who stays humble about it. The best moderators are the ones you can joke around with and just talk to like (most) anyone else on here. I'm glad I could help bc honestly, it's really not worth it to keep going back and forth. Been there and done that. Waaayyyy easier to just forget about it and move on so you can enjoy the rest of what you're doing. And don't forget that there's more to life than reddit, or social media in general. Have a good one and I hope everything works out alright, for the both of you. üòÅ"
modsbeingdicks,fr43lhj,t1_fr42738,1589874643.0,"I think that by leaking the info you really only dug yourself in deeper. I get that you were probably mad in the moment but really, it didn't *do* anything. It's a bit of a sticky situation bc the admins don't really do much about these sorts of things in my experiences. Sometimes it's best to try and take a step back and really think about what's going on and decide if its worth it to keep pursuing someone over something like this or if it's better to kinda forget about it and move on. I'm not saying to be a pushover necessarily, but I mean you guys are just going back and forth on some social media site. As the moderator I think you put yourself in a situation to get some hate almost in the way that politicians get called out. As the moderator though, I also think it's your responsibility to be the bigger person and know when it's time to walk away. There are lots of trolls out there and they mainly fuck with people just bc they like to fuck with people and if you give into that it means they are getting exactly what they want. I think it will benefit the communities you moderate to try and act this way as well. Overall, I'm just some guy on Reddit, but I think as long as you try and better yourself for the future by learning from past mistakes, it'll make you a better a moderator, and also a better person. (Probably rambling but it's 4am here so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

saltwateraquariums,fr2zjnd,t1_fr1reml,1589846947.0,"I personally would try and aim for around a $50 light minimum, get the brightest you can find. If you have a local fish store that you can find then I would talk to them about it and ask for their recommendation, they may give you a couple different options but getting the cheapest one possible is likely to break and you would end up spending more money in the end. Also it's recommended to cycle your tank for 3-4 weeks before putting any live stock in it and a light is not necessary if you don't have fish/coral, so it will give you a chance to maybe save a little more"

I also heard that I should aim for the same thickness as the sides of the tank, so should I just get some 1/4 in. Plexi glass?

No wonder he gave up, his sump alone wasn't even 30 gallons. I've basically replaced everything and I'm trying to do a diy 55 sump, the hardest part of this entire thing is trying to get the baffles for the sump. No one is cutting glass right now and the only place I can see to buy acrylic came out to almost 300 for 4 sheets, but I've been thinking that might be what I end up doing. I just got a really nice protein skimmer, so excited to see it running.

And if you don't have a good refractometer I would pay the 35 and pick one up. And I'm not sure about coral, I added a pulsing Xenia after 1 month and it died very very fast but I heard you can actually add them before fish so maybe I just did something wrong. Best of luck!"
