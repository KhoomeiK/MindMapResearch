A face shield would be a good alternative for those with respiratory issues that prevent them from wearing a mask however. That's also why it's important that those of us who can wear a mask do so. It's as important to protect others as it is to protect ourselves if we're going to eventually halt the spread of this disease.

CoronavirusUS,fr1zl85,t1_fr1l1cs,1589828622.0,"It's ok, apology accepted. We're all frustrated, humans are social creators. It is difficult for us to do this. It's also unfortunately necessary to prevent loss of life, even as doing so sometimes has unintended consequences that result in loss of life, which is very sad. I grieve too for the friend you have lost, even if I never met him, because I understand his pain. 

So I'm very sorry about your friend, isolation is hard and maybe without it someone might have seen the signs in time to save him, but people who are serious tend to keep their plans very secret, because they don't want to be stopped. The suffering is too much, they've lost hope. There is little to guarantee that you or anyone else would have noticed anything was wrong. In fact suicide is more common when people start to feel better than when they're deeply depressed, they don't have the energy until they begin to get a bit better. You may have instead even thought his condition was improving.

I've suffered some pretty extreme depression myself, and continue to do so, sometimes more than others. I can tell you from my own experience, in three suicide attempts even when I lived with my parents, my parents didn't know what was about to happen before it did, neither did any of my friends. I'm only here because women tend to use methods that are less reliably lethal than men. Two overdoses and I slit my wrists, but should I try again, I know I won't survive. I'll do something lethal enough to actually kill me, because as crazy at it sounds, I don't want to fail at it again. 

All I can do is try very hard to make sure there won't be a next time. I have been lucky in often unexpected ways. My son has autism, he needs me, and because of that, he keeps me alive. Not everyone is so lucky to have someone that couldn't make it in life without them, to keep them here. For me it took suicide off the table, maybe not forever but for long enough to survive longer than anyone thought I would. 

I've had friends die myself. Drug overdoses mostly, though you have to wonder if pushing that line so far happened because they no longer cared if they lived or died. I've had friends that committed suicide as well (all people I met in treatment that were trying so hard to get better, which in some sense, made it all the more heartbreaking when they lost their will to survive). It's very difficult to struggle with wondering if you could have done more, but if you feel like you have blame in this situation, believe me you don't. 

Things might be better, if we did more to take care of others. When I talk about doing a better job for each other, I'm mainly speaking of making care more available and easier to obtain, but also just in general everyone should try to be nicer and more understanding of what others are going through. To be more aware that you don't know if someone's having a really bad day.

You can never know what's in someone else's mind, you can only try to be kinder. I always try to have a smile (even though now you can't see it because I'm wearing a mask, I try to convey that it is there anyways), and I try to have a kind word for anyone I talk to, even strangers, and even if it's something short and simple. Not because I'll get something out of it, but because someone else might (though I do get something out of it, I get the good feeling you get when you show compassion). 

So many people in our society feel invisible, and left behind, sometimes just the act of being noticed can change the way someone's day is going. We should all try to do that, to be nice just for the sake of being nice. Be thoughtful of each other and know that we all have our own struggles, because we know, often from personal experience, life can be a terrible struggle. As social creatures, we should be able to conceptualize that some of us struggle with it more than others. Unfortunately there are a lot of entitled and emotionally stunted people. I wish they took more time to think about what they do.

These people refusing to wear masks, refusing to believe this is real, that it's dangerous for many in our society, they're a problem. They don't care enough about others to look beyond themselves. I know that many are suffering job losses and I try to be cognizant of the suffering that causes too, but you can recover from that, death is forever (unless you happen to believe in reincarnation and as it's a religious philosophy, there is no guarantee of that).

Eventually the loss of a friend or a family member  hurts less (besides the friends I've lost, my father was murdered, so I know a bit about lives that ended before they should have). It may never completely stop hurting but at some point you don't think it about it so much anymore, or your understanding becomes greater, and that can help too. At least that's been my experience. It helps to try and understand that they were in such pain that they saw no other way to remedy it, and to know that at least they no longer suffer. As empty as that may sound, I understand the need to escape life when it becomes intolerable, unbearable, when you can't see any way through anymore, when the only comfort becomes the exit sign. 

I feel deeply in my heart that those who could not find peace here, will find it in whatever comes next. I hope that you find some solace in this essay that I seem to have written for you. Be well, and know that the only things you have control of is your own actions towards others."

Keep being who you are, stick to those beliefs that you've laid out here so clearly and I have no doubt that someday you will find someone who likes you and wants to be with you. You'll probably even cycle through a few times before finding that person who's really special. Try not to let that make you overly unhappy, it's okay to be sad for what ended, but your first or even ninth or tenth relationship probably isn't supposed to be your last one. You're supposed to learn things along the way, about how to coexist with another person, and things about yourself that maybe you can improve upon (we can all be better people). Things that once you figure them out often mean your next relationship will be better than the last one.

The biggest obstacle to starting any relationship is risk avoidance, the people who put themselves out there over and over, but don't get beat down by getting shot down, inevitably are the most successful. If you find that you like someone (not because of how they look, no good relationship was ever based solely on appearance, but because of who they are), just try asking them out, even if you think you know it won't be successful, the worst thing that can happen is that they say no, and you graciously accept that answer. 

If you aren't bitter about that no, but instead keep looking, you'll find that someone will say yes. Also practice makes perfect, and after doing it more it eventually doesn't feel bad to be shot down anymore, you just say ok and move on. Like most of life, it's a lot about having the proper mindset. Just because this time you were shot down and a girl said no, doesn't mean that you will be every time, this time is just this time.

science,fpoi4im,t1_fpogbfm,1588784889.0,"That was basically my line of thinking. Bats entire metabolic system is very different from our own, despite them not being all that genetically dissimilar.

Coronavirus,fpo68f1,t1_fpnwzph,1588779091.0,">Although details are still being worked out, the Trump administration said last week that it will use funding under recently passed legislation to help cover the cost of treating uninsured coronavirus patients — as long as the hospital accepting the government's reimbursement rate does not bill the uninsured patient for any remaining balance (i.e., ""balance billing"").

There's no guarantee here yet. Trump's opinion may have already changed or more likely he's just forgotten about it. Hospitals may not agree to the government's reimbursement rate. Until there is actually a signed piece of legislation, everyone is still on the hook. A little later in that paragraph it mentions that they also don't know if they'll only pay the hospitals, or also the physicians who sometimes don't work directly for the hospital but basically work on contract, or the many other costs one can incur at a hospital that aren't technically ""hospital charges"" but are equally unaffordable.

Over 20 million people have lost their jobs, that means that unless they can afford to pay for COBRA (payments that extend your health insurance for some time after you lose your job, usually $1000+ a month), they no longer have insurance. That's the problem with linking insurance to employment. We already had about 28 million people who didn't have insurance. Now it's probably over 50 million.

>Although some of the nation's largest insurers have said they'll waive cost-sharing — i.e., deductibles and co-pays — for treatment, some employer plans can choose not to participate.

>About 157 million people had employer-based plans as of 2018 *(it's probably less now since people have lost their jobs but it was about 47% of the market)*

These employer plans are what they call self-funded plans, the company funds them but they're administered by insurance companies like Aetna or United healthcare. Under those plans it's up to the company how they decide to treat deductibles and co-pays.

Trump also made it possible for people to buy plans that don't meet the ACA standards. So now not everyone's plan meets those guidelines for max out-of-pocket spending or maxing out their policy entirely (you can't max out an ACA policy but before the ACA there were very few plans that you couldn't max out, and then you owed the balance after what your insurance paid). Those people are considered inadequately insured, and make  up millions more people.

Some states are also cutting Medicaid funding right now, which frankly seems insane since they're about to add a bunch of impoverished people and children to the program.

A lot of the people in Medicare, only have basic Medicare, they don't have a Medicare advantage plan, they don't have a medigap plan, they just have Medicare, they would be in the hook for at least $1,408. I live on disability, I only have Medicare,  $1,408 is about 1/10th of my yearly income from SSDI. It's a lot of money to people on SS benefits or SSDI, especially at the lower end of the payment scale. It's unknown what Medicaid might chip in, but I live in a state that refused the Medicaid expansion under the ACA, so it will be as little as they can get away with.

If you read the article there's a lot of details like that, which indicate that a lot of people will probably still be on the hook for some or maybe all of the cost of their care. Even if it's only some, the cost of hospitalization in the US is so high that most people can't afford it."
Coronavirus,fpo0ap7,t1_fpnu18n,1588776051.0,"I'm so sorry. How is she doing? Caught early and especially in young people, strokes are events people can recover from. Though it's rarely easy. I was in coma for a few days (really bad car accident) and spent about two weeks on the stroke floor after I woke up. I saw how difficult it was to go through. My roommate was a woman in her mid to late 40's, but she mostly had a good attitude (she cried a couple times when she was frustrated, but tbh she cried less than I did, tbf I had significant severe mood dysregulation related to brain damage), in just the couple weeks I was there I saw her make real progress.

They're seeing a lot of blood clots with this virus. Something that has been concerning me is that they may be misattributing deaths because of it. If someone is never sick enough to get a test (a lot of people in the US are still having trouble getting a test until they're dying), but still dies due to the virus causing them to throw a clot which causes a stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack where blood supply to the heat is interrupted), or pulmonary embolism, they might be dramatically undercounting deaths, without even knowing it. It won't be obvious until later when we can compare if there was a statistically significant increase in those deaths over previous years."
science,fpnnqkx,t3_gehvui,1588768394.0,"I just really like bats, but I'm not an expert, so these are just my thoughts. Bats body temperatures go up quite a lot over baseline when they fly (much higher than our baseline temperature, I don't know how much off hand, but it's higher than any fever we could live though). These large increases in body temp might mediate viral activity. Making a virus replicate much more slowly in bats (so as they never develop more than a very mild infection), than it would in humans if it were to jump species. It might also cut off one of the bodies best defenses against viruses, fever, since any virus coming from bats is likely already adapted to higher temperatures."

Not that it's anyone's business, but I'm a survivor of a violent gang rape. Before that I was molested by a family member until I was 10.
