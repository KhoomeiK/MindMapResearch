I was still pretty young to really connect with the songs on a personal and emotional level. In 2012 my dad gifted me RED on Christmas, and all of the songs were the Soundtrack of my first ‚Äúheartbreak‚Äù lol I was 12.


But when I was 14 or 15 I revisited the debut and Fearless and they felt new to me, because I had more experience in life and being a teenager, feeling like you don‚Äôt belong or that your crush would never notice you. Those songs are the soundtrack of my teenage years. RED is my favorite album of all time.


Pop Taylor is a strong and empowered woman, I look up to her in so many ways, she is still the kind and down to earth girl she was when she wrote ‚ÄúOur Song‚Äù, in essence I think she hasn‚Äôt change even a bit.

I honestly didn‚Äôt understand any of this until I was a victim too. When you are a girl like me, living in the uptown world, being in a private school, having protective parents, a house, not worries, the world of gender violence and rape was so far away from my pink bubble. 


Last year, when I was 18 years old and 1 month, I was in the school bus back home (I live 1 hour away from my university so I take the bus the school provides for us), I had a terrible migraine and a guy came by and asked me to sit next to me, I said yes because the bus was already full so I had no choice. I fell asleep because the pain was too much for me. Next thing I know this guy is pushing me against the bus window, invading my whole space, touching my thighs and my body like I was nothing. Like if I was an object, ny head was in so much pain I couldn‚Äôt even open my eyes or react, I got a little strength in my body and I opened my eyes and saw his hands in my legs, squeezing them and I tried to pull his hand off but he pulled me away. I felt so powerless and so ashamed. The macho culture is so much in your veins and brain that I kept blaming myself, but after months of therapy I know this wasn‚Äôt my fault.


For how I see it, is a matter of power, some men still believe they have power over us, that they can do and undone whatever they want with us, that we are objects, like if how we feel means nothing, because some of them think we are nothing. But this experience help me to realize that not all men are good and not all men are bad. A friend of mine, who is a male, was so disgusted by this that he reported this to the school authorities and we are still in process. He told me he couldn‚Äôt believe they were still guys like this with no shame.


In this months, I have been thinking about my summer in Canada where I felt so secure and so free to walk around in the street, walking to the store alone or going places in bike was a huge experience for me and I loved it. I hold on to that feeling of security a lot, I hope I could live in Canada someday, but what my heart really really hopes is that every woman in my country and in the world can have that feeling of safety wherever they are."

Somedays are going to be hard, you need to let her know that no matter what you are going to be there for her. 
Tell her that she is really brave for telling you this, tell her that you believe her. Because she is going to have doubts and she needs to know that she is believed by the people she loves.
Never left her out, it may seem that she is doesn‚Äôt have the humor to go out, but even though she may not go out, invite her everywhere, that is going to give her strength to overcome this, to feel better. Remind her that this is not her fault. 


About reporting him, I was sexually abused last year, I was scared of reporting that guy, I was so afraid of him, I am still scared. My psychologist told me that denouncing him was a way of protect me. A friend of mine reported the guy, now I just need to testify. But for everyone is different, tell her that even 10 years from now is valid that she reports him, not matter the time that has passed rape is rape.


Tell her that she should never feel guilty about the consequences he is going to face for doing such despicable things, this is in any way her fault. He is just paying for the decisions he made.

1. Lara Jean‚Äôs outfits and hair.
2. The color palette and production design was on point, everything seemed so pretty, unrealistic but still pretty.
3. More visibility to Lara Jean‚Äôs Korean heritage.
4. Peter remembering stuff Lara Jeans tells him.
5. Lara Jean and Gen‚Äôs scene was good, the jung part was a highlight in my opinion.
6. I am a sucker for rom com‚Äôs.
7. Just one more point because I felt bad about leaving it at 6 lol.


John Ambrose casting remains as one of the most wtf moments of life. Why did they decided to completely ignore what happened at the end of the first movie? No offense to Jordan Fisher he is really talented, but his character was so lame, stuck in the sixth grade, he felt like Lara Jean‚Äôs pet all the time, he was more in love with the thought of sixth grade Lara Jean than the actual Lara Jean. 


In the books you are really in doubt whether you will choose John Ambrose or Peter K. 

John Ambrose was posh af, he was in a private school, had this kind of classic beauty, he was described like a [young Robert Redford](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0-wzZYN4DVGNNzyPSh6chXPZMgE-scsCyLQPXyz_sDzVSkjfV-jc5gra7&s=10). He went to see Lara Jean to school in a fancy vintage car, you totally see why Lara Jean was so appealed by him. Also he was Stormi‚Äôs grandson and that created kind of a conflict of interests in Lara Jean.


Here John Ambrose is not posh, he was only dressed up like my grandpa, he was super boring, the only part that I liked with him was when he was playing the piano, because you could see how talented Jordan Fisher is. He and Lara Jean had no development, they only liked they younger selfs of each other. It was like the ‚Äúwhat could have been?‚Äù.


Lara Jean and Peter lacked of chemistry in this one, they didn‚Äôt have like cute moments like in the first movie, all their moments involved kissing and fighting, nothing new. In this one you are rooting for Peter because he is the least worse. Also, in the books when he gives Lara Jean the heart locket it is so much thoughtful.


There was a lot going on in the background like Chris and Trevor and Dr. Covey and Mrs. Rothschild. Both storylines felt unnecessary.


The movie feels short and undeveloped. I really wanted to love this movie and John Ambrose, but ugh this was so bad. They did it all wrong, there were to many unnecessary moments and lack of development and cute moments like the last one one had.

My mom came to pick me up gave a spirulina juice and took me to my swimming practice like nothing happened, I dropped off swimming and I was really depressed and I felt I was not enough.

And well in terms of who the better choice is, obviously Winnie because of the money and everything else, but the heart wants what it wants"
Anne,fd6qwel,t1_fd4ce9l,1578194616.0,"I mean it‚Äôs pretty obvious that Winnie wasn‚Äôt a right choice for Gilbert, her father was in subtle way manipulating Gilbert into marrying his daughter, then when he goes and breaks it off with her she is mostly mad because it is going to make her look bad, she is more concerned about her reputation. She was the one ready to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù with Gilbert because it seems she had no other choice and she was obviously older, I didn‚Äôt like them together and it was odd that her WEALTHY father was so happy about her daughter marrying down, if that makes sense."

Advice,fcjk64m,t1_fcjiib8,1577690871.0,"Thank you so much! I attend to therapy in school since the incident and a friend of mine reported the guy to the school authorities and the process is going to start next month I hope.


I really have no clue of why she would tell them, the friend that laughed constantly asks my mother about me so maybe that‚Äôs why she told her. When my mother mentioned her about the denouncement she told her to think about the boys parents and I was like heck no! Every consequence about what he did to me is the result of his decision not mine! Why should I feel guilty?


After something like this happens to you, you feel stained for life, because all the prejudice and the fear gets into your head, and when you tell someone that is not compassionate about this they simply judge you, and I feel dirty and guilty to feel like this.


Her friend even said that she has been touched everywhere, and that she has been through a lot worse. But still she has no compassion. If she knew how many sleepless nights I got, how I started crying in the middle of a class, how scared I was to get in the bus, how do I feel when I look into my loving father eyes and I feel like I am lying to him because he doesn‚Äôt know, how I failed two important tests because my mind wouldn‚Äôt let me study because I was constantly of scared of everyone even my brother but still I managed to get satisfactory grades in all my classes, how I didn‚Äôt have my period for like 40 days because I had so much stress, and how I am here after 116 days crying in the middle of the night because what happened to me and what it‚Äôs still happening to a million women out there it‚Äôs not FAIR.

The only thing I got from this is that I feel like a value myself more because I am not letting that guy or anyone else to dictate my worth.


Sorry for the rant but I am mad, and thanks again you are a really caring person and I am thankful for you, I send you lots of love and a hug üß∏ And I am sorry you went through this situation as well :( I hope everything is okay"

I am not part of the LGBTQ community but after the Maya Forstater scandal I decided to do a little research of trans community and I ended up in this subreddit. I was ignorant over the fact that some trans people realize they didn‚Äôt take a right decision or ended up in a situation like the one that Jazz is in. I remember seeing commercials of the reality show when I was a kid, and I just thought that this is just plain sad, she was just a kid and it is unfair what she has been up to, and she is so young :( I hope everything turns out good for her and for everyone here"
