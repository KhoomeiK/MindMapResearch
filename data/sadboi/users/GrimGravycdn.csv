This right here and not to be a ""debbie downer"" but companies will always have the mentality of ""you'll be more focused at work with no distractions!"" 

I've worked in an office for 7 years! My god, the distractions are endless there! People walking by your desk stopping to talk because they're waiting for their print-outs, or asking stupid questions (""is the printer working?"" how the fuck should I know?).  People who would send an email then come over to your desk to ask if you got it and want to discuss it right at that moment. 1 hours long meetings regarding budgets (really? you just can't send a fucking email saying we're on top of things? meetings were the worst as they super upset my stomach) Missing out on half your break because you have to stand in line for a crappy cup of coffee because the guy in front of you has to talk about his god damn back pains to the company lunch lady. 

When I quit and went freelance, it was so relaxed and I could hyper focus on my work for hours straight, no one called, tv running in the background, the coffee is always on (and good!), skipping the ridiculous *3 hours of round-trip commuting* daily, it was beautiful. I got so much work done."

I spent the first 30 years of my life without a mobile phone and, in hindsight, it was bliss. When I got my first one, I started feeling exactly the way you are feeling. Being constantly ""connected"" made me feel way worse than before I had a mobile phone.

Can I just ask a few things for you to think about? 

How many messages are you getting? Are these directly sent to you? Can you eliminate any spammers? Unsubscribe from any emails?

What notifications are you receiving? Are these just social media posts? Is this facebook related? You can turn off soooo many notifications and that might turn down the anxiety. (I think most apps have options to reduce or turn off notications) Eliminate the notifications you don't actually need. 

Will a late reply truly ""disappoint"" whoever is sending it? Consider explaining to your friends (I know, this sentence is anxiety inducing) that you may not be able to reply immediately. Honestly, if whoever they are truly is disappointed in not receiving an immediate reply from you, then they are really a selfish individual. If it's an emergency, they can call.

And finally, are these notifications job related? If so, then maybe start thinking about whether the job is something you actually *want* to be doing."

adhdwomen,fedw9dh,t3_eokune,1579021220.0,"Yep. In the beginning (I believe at around 5 years old)it was nail biting and skin picking/biting around my nails(cuticles). Also the inside of my cheek.

The nail biting problem I solved in my teen years by always carrying a high-quality nail file (like an O.P.I crystal file). I would file instead. The cheaper carboard files just didn't work...they were too rough and got damaged way too quickly. Took a while, but eventually I stopped biting my nails entirely! Coincidently, I gave my co-worker this same advice about a nice nail file and gave her one this past Christmas. Her nails are actualy growing now and she's so proud of herself! 

This year (I'm now in my early 40s) it is my resolution to stop the skin picking, cuticle picking/biting. So I'm scrubbing my finger nails with a nail brush every day (to remove dead flaky skin, which is a huge trigger for my habit) and I'm now wearing a fidget ring on my thumb so any time I begin to pick, I spin my ring instead. I started this about a month ago. It's not foolproof (I bled my cuticles a couple days ago from overthinking) but it's been helping a LOT.

As for the inside cheek biting, I'm trying out a silicone adhd/autism/anxiety chew necklace, but the thickness is too much and just hurts my tmj instead, so I'm keeping an eye out for a thinner one. 

I hope this helps. :)"

AmItheAsshole,f9ri55m,t3_e6l3cx,1575576661.0,"NTA It's ridiculous this is happening. I love your trap idea. If someone freaks out over spilling, ""whelp! It must have been a faulty coke can.  These things happen.  /shrug+smug smile.""  I'd rather them fuck their shit up rather than just getting a flat coke. 

Also, have you talked to HR about this coke thief? Tell them all you have done to discourage the thief from stealing your coke?  And by any chance are you allowed to keep one of those tiny tiny 2-cans-of-coke desk top refridgerators? They're pretty sweet. :)"

AskReddit,f4a26fx,t3_djykwv,1571487873.0,"Super late to the game, but I get a terrible skin crawling sensation on my nose. Not like itchy  I'm going to sneeze. Rather, the skin on the outside of my nose (dorsum and tip) gets hella tingly (skin crawling) and that feeling makes me scratch at it. Never on the inside. This is an external problem only.

Sometimes it's caused by big stress. Sometimes it's caused by certain spices or smells. And it only happens on my nose.

It can happen anywhere. Home. Work. Visiting others. In someones car. This isn't isolated to one location. 

Antihistamines and creams never stop it. Often I try to be proactive and take antihistamines in case it happens, but have learned that it never prevents it. Putting pressure (eg. wearing a bandanna pressed across my nose ) halts the tingling sensation then I just have to wait it out.

I've told doctors, but they don't seem to offer any solutions or answers."
