So it’s really not the same as interracial marriages literally at all... you could also fire a woman from a catholic school for being openly promiscuous because that goes against their values as well.

I wonder if he has to downplay it because if he doesn't, then he's going to worry every single second you leave the house. Even become overbearing. My exbf got jumped (I know its not the same), and every time he would leave the house I would pick a fight. It took me awhile to realize that I was somehow mad at him for being in the wrong place at the wrong time?? But then I realized I wasn't mad at him at all. I was mad at myself for somehow not preventing it???? It's really complicated but I definitely think you should have a real conversation with him and let him know that if he can't react appropriately (for you) to what you're feeling/dealing with, then he shouldn't react at all."

If it's important to you, and very very minor to him (aka bc hes not a photographer) then why wouldn't he just do this for you? Seems selfish to me?

I agree it's not a BIG deal, but I understand why it's offputting because I don't see a reason why he WOULDNT do it for you..

&#x200B;

He'd rather take it down than praise his girlfriend (\^\^) publicly? Seems strange. Maybe he's insecure. Or frankly wants the praise.

I finally found lexapro and propranolol as a combo for my anxiety and bipolar - incredible. It's honestly hard to explain. you just dont have those thoughts at all. sometimes if I feel myself getting a little stressed and my chest tightens, I can literally be like ""ok come on what are you doing this isnt you. relax"" and I actually relax!

I know that sounds awful, but I think that now he's seeing how every time you're irresponsible (no matter how small) as a giant red flag that this attack, or anything, could happen again. 

He's so scared. You can see it in his actions: ""you have to learn"" because even after this trauma you're still ""irresponsible,"" which makes him feel vulnerable and unprotected. I put these in quotes because, logically, we both know you're not actually acting irresponsibly. You're trying to keep yourself ""normal"" and going through the motions

I want to emphasize - THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP. you could be ANY boyfriend, friend, etc. This truly is all about him, and his perception of why/how the attack happened. So please please please, don't take this personally. It truly has nothing to do with how you treat him or the type of boyfriend you are.

Now, you might be thinking: ""but. this happened to BOTH of us. why does he get to act like this and I just have to take it? I'm a victim too""

100%. But, we love our partners for their strengths AND their weaknesses. Maybe coping is YOUR strength but HIS weakness. And you two cope differently. He lashes out, whereas you seem to TAKE blame, and wonder what YOU're doing wrong. The only true two emotions in life are love and fear. While you're using this attack to try to hold onto love, he's letting fear creep in. Hunny, you're doing nothing wrong. This is just his process. But what you need to do is say to yourself, ""Can I handle this?""

You're just as valuable as he is, and a relationship is 50/50. If you CAN'T say to yourself ""I love him enough to be his punching bag for a little, if that's what he needs. I have confidence and faith in this relationship, and I'm willing to make that sacrifice for him"" - then you need to get out of there ASAP. this is a long long road. Do NOT sign up to be someone's shoulder, if you aren't strong enough to stand for both of you. Really take some time to look at who you are, and who you want to be, and where you want to be with him, before making a decision on how to approach him.

Like I was NOT info fucking my bf doggy and I have this weird kink where I want him to start kissing my neck while im getting ready in the morning. Told him that a bunch of times. He never would get his ass up outta bed early enough. Then he'd get mad when I didn't want a quickie before work. acting like he was giving me what I wanted?
