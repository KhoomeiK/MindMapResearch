xboxone,fffwaun,t1_fffw2nv,1579893206.0,Okay. Last question. Can I use an old Xbox 360 to make my home console and friend share from that?
xboxone,fffw0vv,t1_fffvg2p,1579893030.0,Thank you. Can I change my home console to a PC using the Xbox console companion app on windows 10? I can definitely sign into that with my account info.

depression,f9vknpk,t3_e6wilf,1575672805.0,"We sleep every day. That experience is great. It can be a disorder though as a result of mental health issues or it can be a result of irresponsible decision making, like choosing to not prioritize enough time for sleep and putting other things above it, it changes the brain chemistry.over time. Also. Death is sleeping forever. That will come eventually but for now I'd personally like to try and correct my mental health issues and experience life with proper balance."
depression,f9774l1,t3_e3q4il,1575160923.0,"The more you choose habitual behavioural responses to life's hurdles the more you reinforce depression itself and the neural networks that will make it your default state. 

I'm 34 and just learned about neural pathway growth and Human/child behavioural development. The knowledge allowed me to truly see my current situation, my problems and why it's like this, how it got like this, and what i can do to change things. It gave me a way to put it on paper with definable and measurable information that I could finally understand."
depression,f93k303,t3_e33wws,1575061034.0,"I honestly love telling my therapist about my life and feelings. It feels good but I mostly anticipate learning something from it by sharing it. Sometimes they'll say something about it or they'll Sheppard me into the direction that allows me to see for myself. It's a really good feeling. It wont fix all your problems though, that takes time and effort and a willingness to change out the old unhealthy things with the new and healthier things."

hypertension,f8yok2r,t3_e2sfr2,1574950538.0,"Blood pressure can be wonky and frustrating. I was around 140/80 and on ramipril 10 mg, then suddenly I'm averaging 165/90 a few years later. Then my doc adds 10mg amlodipine, then later a diuretic. Blood pressure barely moved. I picked up the pace in walking, I went from 3 - 15 minute walks a week to walking about 100 miles a month and started focused deep breathing exercises. The deep breathing dropped my BP from 165/93 to 130/75 after 30 minutes of deep breathing. I've since been as low as 120/70. But for some odd reason I've had two hypertensive emergencies this month. ""Emergencies"" they all tell us to go to a hospital asap if we go above 180/100. But then they do literally nothing at the hospital, ever. I don't get it."
hypertension,f8yg6bz,t3_e1qhm6,1574946692.0,"I'd go to the ER. When I'm not in a hypertensive emergency I take my medication and a few other things like cayenne pepper which can relax the blood vessels. I also take magnesium and potassium because I know damn well my cardiovascular system is burning through those important minerals much faster than usual. Eat high nitric producing foods, spinach and beets. 

One of the biggest things that is helping me right now is focused deep breathing exercises for 20-30 minutes a day , twice a day. When I did my first session my BP was 165/93 prior to the breathing exercises and it was. 130/80 after I was done. It's since been as low as 120/73. Almost scary seen low numbers like that for the first time in ten years. Hopefully your dad has the patience or attention span for it. Lots middle /old aged folk are pretty stubborn."

I'd like to try and avoid an attempted repair though because it seems to be the consensus that the problem is both hardware and software related which Google attempted to fix with their April.1 2019 update and failed. They still haven't been able to address the issue yet in any updates. But yeah. I'd prefer a complete device replacement."
CreditCards,f6yvm48,t3_dtogo8,1573300048.0,"Good to see someone so young is so enthusiastic about scoring high with Credit rating. So many don't even understand what it means to miss payments, not make full payments, not make payments at all and even ending up in collections. This type of stuff should be taught in-depth in schools. If it is now that's good. It wasn't back in the 90's. There was a time when I hurt my credit rating so bad that I couldn't even get an apartment with a decent rental agency.   


Keep learning and stay interested. You're on a good path."

PersonalFinanceCanada,f6pi2ny,t1_f6pg2hm,1573056827.0,"I totally get that and agree. I'm just in a bad spot right now and even decided to make partial payments on some bills not realizing the may be reported as **missed** or delinquent and now I'm broke and absolutely do not want missed payments on my credit file, I'd rather pay the interest off one time on a new card.. the bank won't help either. Maybe I'm overreacting? By the end of the month, I'll be capable of clearing up the new card completely along with making all my other bills in full no problem as well. So on the bright side I'll be paid up but with just a little less extra income."

CreditCards,f6jnzaa,t1_f6jmqzd,1572897600.0,The website is also all over the place with a time requirement. Some places it says three months others it says 6 months and it even says anywhere between 6-12 months. All on the same page. No explanation. I've tried using the website but there's nothing available in offers and upgrades. So I called and used the automated service for increase requests and I also talked to an agent.

CreditCards,f6jkvfn,t1_f6jalxi,1572896252.0,"It's Canadian. I think we only have Transunion and Equifax. Everyone else that does credit checks pulls your report from them anyways . So 650 is considered good while 649 is considered fair just for some reference . I don't have any missed payments or outstanding loans or debts on my file. Just my open accounts, good standing and consistent payments reported. Now keep in mind I'm playing with the smallest unsecured credit card amount possible of $300.  And I'm only looking for a minimal increase which I think is $200-$300. I wouldn't think they'd really expect much more than my compliance with their expectations and proof of accountability which I figured I had provided. It's also my only card. I also have a $2000 student loan paid in full on file. Ive only had the card for 7 months but like I said, everyone says they got one in six months and even the website says only one increase per six months."

Understanding the full spectrum can help you make healthier choices for a healthier outlook. My idea and fear of death stretches far beyond physical death.

depression,f4060wq,t3_diumqx,1571286240.0,"People relating to others'pain and suffering in a very compassionate and emotional state can actually trigger some very beneficial physiological responses in the body which can in turn allow for a better mental state. I just hope people are aware of their psychological and physiological responses to immediate experiences. It's important for us to understand our feelings when we can be so fragile and vulnerable to impulsive thoughts and feelings and even responses that are on full autopilot, I made a clear distinction there because impulsive suggests you're somewhat in control, depends on who you're talking to about it.

The reason I think that is because I found some buscopan and started taking it to not much avail. It was about the same as the loperamide. I'm thinking over-inflammation. Also waiting on results from the doctor which may take awhile because I have to follow a specific diet to do.the tests and I haven't been able to start yet. I'll post back with result at a later date. I've also.started walking about 5-8 km a day which I think is helping a lot, at first it's felt detrimental but I'm sure I'm breaking through a plateau, just takes time, patience and continued exercise to transform the intestinal tract."
