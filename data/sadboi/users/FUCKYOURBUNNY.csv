Dermatology,fe61xnq,t3_enx6qf,1578879953.0,"I get this on arm, legs, back. it itches and sometimes if it happens at night it makes it impossible to sleep. 
I am using some cream to make it stop itch but it takes long time  to work.
I don’t think it’s what I eat because I eat very little since I am dieting. 
thank you in advance 🙏"
