shrooms,fr3n93k,t1_fr2tsgv,1589861231.0,"It was not pleasant for most of it tbh, I'll try to explain the main section for you.

Whatever I thought became reality, but my thoughts were looping, so from my perspective actual reality started to loop. I was not creating outlandish things with my brain, so saw nothing odd.

Basically what the night consisted of was 8 straight hours of me getting in and out of bed for what must've been 50-odd times repeating the same things, it completely broke me for a good while. 

edit: during the above I thought multiple times of calling emergency services, the only thing that prevented me doing so, or going mad was the fact that although the time on my phone seemed to largely stay the same, the light outside still continued it's march toward daylight.

I seem to remember my current voice being replaced by a more upper class one as I forgot what me-ness was, I used to have an RP accent but have since changed it slightly unconsciously to blend in I assume. I also seem to remember having some sort of childhood fight (we're talking pre-primary) where I badly hurt a clothes child or killed them, ofc this can't be real but it was a small bit disturbing.

Overall it has just made me be kinder to people around me and more happy the days following (2 so far)

That is all I can really remember."

shrooms,fr2f89y,t1_fr2ebyt,1589836247.0,"Ahh, I new there had to be a catch, could these still potentially be used for workable syringes?

As growing is a constant risk for me and after tripping on 132g (wet ofc) I want to stop growing but not fully shut the door on these curious little fellows and I thought prints would be perfect to do that.

These prints were taken in a disused kitchen in which I did all my inoculation and fruiting (10/10 uncle bens bags, no contam) with glasses over the caps.

Would these be usable in the future for syringes or would they definitely lead to contam?

Also how would you suggest storing them? 

Many thanks!"

Not a brilliant example, but it really helps if you can recognize these things and take action and form good habits whilst doing so.
