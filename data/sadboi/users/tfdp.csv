depression,fbn9kzg,t3_edhcd2,1576994567.0,Yup. I try to jump in and make conversation...but I hear myself talking and it feels so fake/artificial....like i'm (poorly) acting in a play.
depression,fbn094u,t3_edpkii,1576991027.0,"I remember when the shift to anger started. I would say that for the first half of my life....I was very ""sensitive"". If people were mean to me, bullied me, or things didn't go the way they should....I would disconnect and be upset about it in private.

But then one day...my boss ridiculed me for a good 20min in front of everyone. I couldn't control it and started crying. I'm a guy...and in my mind that made me look like a complete fucking pussy in front of everyone. After that...when someone ""critiqued"" me...my blood would boil and I was ready to fight. I never hit anyone...but that option was now on the table. It kind of gave me confidence in a weird, twisted way. At first, I thought this was a good thing...but now that short temperedness has spilled over into everything. I'm aware of it in the moment...but I usually can't stop myself. Nothing physical (yet)...just yelling and saying stuff I regret later."
