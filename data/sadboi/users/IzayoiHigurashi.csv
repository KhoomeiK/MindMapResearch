Is our Great Commission to spread the truth, the gospel, to the world. 
We believe that this is the correct pathway and we believe we are just saving other people's life.
If your child or the random person don't want to believe in God and Jesus, you can't obligate them. You can't indoctrinate them. That is wrong.
They have the freedom to decide.
That's why the correct thing is to raise your child in the faith you believe can save their spirits and if when they grow up decide they believe this from their hearts, they can accept the Holy Spirit and be baptized.
If your children decide to not believe, well then, is their choice.
I must say you have to raise them teaching them the truth but leaving everything clear, that they have to take the personal decision one day.
That's how I've been raised, and I decided by my own will, I wanted to keep on being a believer of Jesus."

You are a very strong person and you will recover with time.
But despite all of that, she is still your mother, a human being and the person who gave you life. 
Saving the hate for her only will torture you and her for the rest of your lifes.
She is damaged probably, just like you. I'm not saying she is a good person or anything that she did to you was right, but you gotta empathize with her a little bit, not because she is your mother, but because she is a human. 
The things she is doing to recover you (sending anime stuff), just shows that she knows she did wrong and she misses you.
Forgiveness is precious gift you give someone not because they deserve it but because you understand the pain better than anyone.
I know this is going to have a lot of down votes, because everyone just wants to pay hate with hate and sin with sin, but that is the destructive behavior that will slowly kill you inside.
I hope you can once talk with her, tell her sorry for your words, and that you forgive her for the things she did to you in the pass, and then leave and live your life in peaceful way with no guilty.

Well, you can think whatever you want to please your called logic, even tho you have not even a single point to prove you are right. 

If this is the way you find to support your thoughts, then go, think what you want. Blame religion, blame church, bring again those facts that catholic leaders did in the past to support your point. I've been reading the same arguments from atheist through my life and is impossible to argue with blind minded people.

But start practicing a little bit more, you are going to find other christians and you can do better next time. 

You have been assuming things about me from the start to give you ways to generate a solid argument, I didn't assume nothing from you but I still have better point.

Who says I've never doubt my faith ? Who says I never ask myself if everything was worth it ? 

Do you think I didn't reject God in my entire life? Do you think I believe in something I don't understand? Do you think I believe just because I was told to? Since I was born? You think I wasn't pointing the logic in every verse and doctrine from the Bible through my life?

If you think so, you are wrong. If you need to assume thinks to develop your argument, you need to start creating new ones. 

To end all this, I just want to ask you, to forget about the ''I have to convert people to atheism to save the world because the world will be better without God'' thing. 

The problem with the world is not religion, is not faith, is not God. The problem are those ignorant and mediocre people who don't educate their selfs and those corrupted sinners who don't follow Jesus's teching.

If I vote, I don't care about the candidate's faith but his/her capacity, I that's something from an educated person, not from a christian neither and atheist. 

If you actually want to make the world better, start preaching about education and knowledge, mutual respect and tolerance (just like, how Jesus did), not against God. 

Think about it a little bit.

Is it a problem for you that there are others who believe in God?

Sorry for saying this, I don't want to offend you, but is very pathetic your intent to ""make"" others

First of all, it doesn't even help in anything in life to be atheist so your action of  going there and preach about your phylosophy of creation is pointless. Don't waste your time, it doesn't make sense.
Is more reasonable from me to try to convert you to save your soul, but I have realized (from the beginning of the conversation) you are one of those who don't have solution...
Second, I find very egocentric from you, the assumption of my lack of security of what I believe.
