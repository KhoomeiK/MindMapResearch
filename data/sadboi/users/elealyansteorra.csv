You can say it's only for kids, or you can accept that maybe it's just not your exact taste. I mean, Inglorious Basterds was an amazing WW2 movie, and so was Saving Private Ryan.

You can only really focus on yourself. What did you survive? Not accomplish. SURVIVE. Because honestly, with this condition we go around with, most things are survival. You made it to this point. 23!
