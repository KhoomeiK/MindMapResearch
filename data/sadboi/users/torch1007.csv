Twitch,fn0grvg,t3_fyg7ll,1586541650.0,"That’s awesome! We all start somewhere, 1% growth is still growth. Keep the dream alive and keep growing. Congrats!

A few things I’d recommend to help in the journey:

1. Network - collaboration with other start up streamers is “sometimes” a good idea. Keeping good connections can lead to even more growth and long term friendships down this journey. Just knowing you’re not alone is an awesome thing.

2. Re-watch your streams. When you have great streams, analyze them and see what was making it great. Was it the game; energy; topics; etc.

3. Never forget why you’re doing this, even if it’s just casual streaming. Always have a solid foundation for streaming so that you can look back and get you back on track with the goal and dream.

4. Stay healthy - this is physically and especially mentally. It isn’t an easy grind by any means and we end up forgetting about ourselves. Make sure you’re eating properly and getting good exercise (just up and out of the chair for walks) nothing crazy. Get plenty of sleep, and take breaks when you need to.

Wish you all the best in your streaming endeavor! You got this!"
EntrepreneurRideAlong,fmkf7hx,t3_fuo3ao,1586152937.0,"1. Create a Facebook page as an artist

2. A mass 10k followers. Views are good, but followers under a creator page is what allows you to implement ads.

3. After a massing a good follower base, start reaching out for sponsorships.

4. If he continues to grow even bigger, sell merchandise.

I believe after getting so many followers on a platform you’ll start getting recognition from bigger artist. Follower base is everything, and is one of the biggest things they look for in up and coming artist and content creators.

Facebook gives you the tools in putting yourself out there, you just need to utilize them the right way."

I promise that if a psychological study was done on interviews with those immigrants that started those Fortune 500 companies, they would all be proud to say they migrated over and were now Americans.

Also it has nothing to do with what Americans are taught in our schools. 1/3 of our population is made up of immigrants. It’s only statistical that immigrants would be in the top tier of people living in the U.S. as well. Which tells us that America actually is all about immigration, and that if you just work hard, build your network, and make a name for you, you get places.
