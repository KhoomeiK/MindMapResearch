CCSP,fn5bq0u,t1_fn26l12,1586660752.0,"Yes, I think it boils down to this: authorized SERVICES can access the data, but no Microsoft personnel. The risks the availability key mitigate (complete data loss in the event of key mismanagement, availability of data during transient errors where AKV can't be accessed ) is a good tradeoff to having this key exist."
AskNetsec,fmwvdcr,t3_euwdhl,1586453699.0,The M365 service won't reach onto an on-prem HSM or key store. You must generate your keys on-prem and perform a secure HSM-HSM transfer to the cloud so services have access to the keys at cloud scale. You can also generate your keys directly in AKV.

Seattle,f4xlepf,t3_dlvbnt,1571866661.0,"Those could be bird prints and the oil from our flying friend's feathers rubbed against the window. The most prominent mark in the middle looks like it could be a wing flapped repeatedly against the window with tail feathers down below. Moreover, the other marks don't look like hand prints. A bird tried to come in and say hello like in Snow White!"
Seattle,f4xgw19,t3_dm1d94,1571865519.0,Depends on how fast you can run.
