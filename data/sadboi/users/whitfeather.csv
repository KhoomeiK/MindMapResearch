WayOfTheBern,fkopwbj,t1_fko3yhm,1584392511.0,Ad-hominem attack.  Citing wikipedia doesnt change the fact that you are vastly overestimating the supreme court's power and that they are untouchable so they really aren't restricted by political parties once they are appointed.
WayOfTheBern,fkope3g,t1_fko6276,1584392180.0,"How is voting for who I want a waste? There is no difference between the 2 candidates.  Actually trump spoke out against the war on terrorism.  Biden voted for it.  I dont know what you guys are talking about when you say they are soooooo different.  Different on what important policies? Biden is pro-corporate, military industrial complex.  He'll spend 90% of discretionary spending on the military and double the deficit just like every president before him since Reagan.  So when you say any rational person would vote for them, what about a person who has a degree in criminal justice and political science? Would I then be irrational, considering I hate roughly 7 years more of education on this topic as you."
WayOfTheBern,fkooys5,t1_fkofxs8,1584391879.0,Both Reps and Dems use gerrymandering.  Biden has been almost completely silent on it except that its bad.  Bernie is much more anti-gerrymandering.  You should check out his policies.
