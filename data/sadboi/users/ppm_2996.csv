sex,fl2likt,t3_flx3u5,1584753888.0,"Honestly I’m not a big fan of kissing either (24 F). I’m talking about kissing with tongue. Otherwise, I could peck my boyfriend all day with kisses on every surface of his handsome face and body. I find that I get too much in my head thinking about all the disease causing bacteria and viruses associated with saliva, therefore grossing me out. (Maybe because of my background in the biology?) However during sex I don’t give a flying fuck about all that and kiss him with tongue. So with that being said I could kinda see where he’s coming from!!"

You both started the sober route for a reason,  your love for each other!! Time heals and hopefully eventually her parents will realize you two are good for each other. I have friends who met via drugs are are now clean and have been married for years. I don’t think their siblings escalated their situation but that being said, wtf is her sisters problem?!"

DiagnoseMe,f2uco9r,t1_f2ryv89,1570413146.0,This exact reaction happens to me randomly alllll over my body. It could happen to me today then a year later it  happens again everyday for a month or two. So random. During my first year of university I had it almost everyday of my first semester. It got so bad I had to miss a few classes. To be fair I had no self control and would scratch and make it a lot worse. I went to a doctor and took an allergy test but the doctor told me it was environmental and it would be super hard to identify so if it ever happens I would just have to take an over the counter anti histamine. It’s such an awful feeling!!! I hope it doesn’t happen again!!!
