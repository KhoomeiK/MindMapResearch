He then appeared behind the altar and after we talked for a bit the black walls of the church started to fade out and I was in a beautiful garden as well. I could see the church in the distance standing right next to a cliff side.

I never received any kind of support from my parents. My mom made fun of me for it and used it against me in arguments and my dad never spoke with me about it. 
To be fair though me mom is a pretty broken person so I don't blame her. 
If you trust your parents enough just wait for a good moment to tell them. I personally would start with a lighter topic and then slowly move forward to telling them about your depression. But you gotta do what feels right to you.
Also don't let anyone tell you that your emotions aren't valid just because you ""don't have a reason to be depressed"". Traumatic events or other bad things sure can cause depression but it can happen to everyone. 

I hope that if you tell your friend or parents that they'll understand you and be there for you.

Don't treat him like a snowflake, stuff like treating them different and making your whole life about them will make them feel like a burden.

DemonolatryPractices,ffwypw4,t3_evareh,1580314003.0,"You only really need the demons sigil, his enn and meditation practice. Everything else is more for you than for the demon. I recommend doing more complicated ritual in the beginning so you can focus better and it also sets the mood. You can lite some candles and/or incense, draw a Pentagramm on the floor or ask for other demons first before you actually invoke the demon that you want to talk to. Just do what feels right to you.
Draw his Sigil and gaze at it, chant his enn and picture the sigil in your mind and meditate. After some time you might hear his voice or even see him or a portal/energy field. As a beginner you might just be able to hear his voice in your head or just feel it's emotions or energy. Meditation is needed to open your mind and know which thoughts and emotions are yours and which aren't. You have to understand how your mind works to do so.
As a beginner you should also inform yourself about the demon you're contacting and find out what he likes how he appears etc.
Offerings are appreciated but be careful with blood since it's incredible powerful.
Once you successfully invoked the demon you can start talking to him and tell him your demands or questions. Always be respectful but not fearful or bow down to him too much. If you're not sure if something is unrespectful think if you would find it respectful or not. If you find it unrespectful don't do it (I personally think protection circles are unrespectful while other people are perfectly fine using them so I personally wouldn't use them).
Keep in mind that demons work with you, not for you. If you're asking for a favor from a demon then you have to work to achieve the goal you asked him to help you with.
If you're finished and just asked some questions and got your answer feel free to destroy the sigil afterwards, if you asked him for something that will take more time  keep the sigil in an safe but respectful place.
I personally never invoked a demon (but two reached out to me during my meditation and I was able to communicate with them) and this is just what I know after some weeks of intense research so I recommend taking this comment as a general help but research things on your own before you invoke anything.
I hope I could help. if you got any more questions feel free to ask me and if I know the answer I'll tell you."

I am actually planning on buying the book as soon as I got the money for it.
Quick question though, do you think King Paimon could be my patron? After this contact I feel like something is watching over me."
DemonolatryPractices,ffd90xl,t1_ffd8h11,1579815786.0,I'm not interested in evocations or trying to control demons. I'd go for an invocation instead. As I said I only bought The Lesser Key for the List and Sigils of the 72 Spirits.
DemonolatryPractices,ffd2pn3,t1_ffd1smn,1579812246.0,"Ok, thank you!"
DemonolatryPractices,ffd0upr,t1_ffd08s6,1579811203.0,"Thank you! I've actually came up with in idea to contact King Paimon with the help of a candle. I've wrote about this in another comment. 
I guess I'll have to do a lot more research then."
DemonolatryPractices,ffd09jt,t1_ffczpzu,1579810880.0,"Thank you for your quick answer.
I've practiced Meditation in the last few days and I know I am not ready for an invocation but I've thought about trying to talk to King Paimon with the help of a candle. I thought I'd draw his Sigil and chant his enn. Afterwards I'd ask him to make the flame flicker as a way to answer my questions. I really want to get in contact with him.
Would you need a lot of Meditation practise for something like that?"
