Maybe you could take some time to find out / work on what you enjoy doing outside of work? I mean, 24 is still young, especially in today's world. You've got the time my man.

I think that we too often, and I'm guilty of this myself, look to our work life for fulfilment. I'd say misguided social conditioning is to blame for that. I've slowly come to realise that we can't rely on what we do for money to bring us fulfilment and meaning, or even satisfaction. It's the life we live outside of that superficial realm which really matters, as cliche as that sounds.

In saying that, I do recognise that most of us will spend a huge amount of our life ""working"" and so it would be ideal if we could all do something that aligned with our interests/personality. But the reality is that the market determines which jobs/skills are in demand. Unfortunately it doesn't care about what interests you. 

A smart way to navigate the job market (speaking from my limited experience):

1. Figure out what skills are in demand and will continue to increase in demand for the foreseeable future. 

2. Figure out your priorities (i.e. How important is a fat paycheck? Job satisfaction? What about work-life balance? Flexible hours? Maybe you want the option to work remote? Maybe you want to work for yourself? Maybe you want a job in a different country?) 

3. Do your research to find out what skills/jobs most closely align with your priorities.

4. Pursue those skills until the market deems you proficient enough to pay you for them.

Honestly, I think IT/software development is a great industry to be in since it won't be going away anytime soon. The job opportunities are there if you have the skills. And the resources for learning those skills are abundant (there are so many online courses, both free and paid). Degrees and diplomas often aren't as valuable as we tend to think they are in today's economy. What ultimately matters are your skills and your ability to demonstrate them with proficiency. Combine this with real-world experience and in most cases you're job ready.

However, at the end of the day, a job is just that- a job. It's what gets you money and puts food on the table so you can go and enjoy the things that actually matter.

I'll end this with a personal story: It was a goal of mine for a very long time to be my own boss. I've always enjoyed photography and I wanted to become a freelancer. Earlier this year I made that dream come true. I'm now a freelance real estate photographer with a small handful of clients. Great right? Well, while it's great that I'm my own boss and I accomplished a pretty big goal, I was left feeling kind of... Empty. Turns out I kinda fucked up. I had made the mistake of aligning my wellbeing and my sense of meaning and identity with what I do for a living. I'd neglected the parts of my life that actually matter. I realised I had no social life as I'd focused almost solely on this goal at the expense of most of my relationships. Don't get me wrong, I still have friends, but I fell out of contact for so long that I no longer have any ""close"" friends. I haven't done anything worth remembering in over a year now. I've literally just been focused on work and business. Meaningless stuff. I realise now how much it's drained me of life. I've also come to realise that ""being my own boss"" may not be all that great: during a standard workday I hardly have any contact with other people, and even though I'm introverted, it's not as great as it sounds. On top of that I live with my parents so they're essentially the only people I hang out with on any given day. I'm currently teaching myself to code so I can go and get a decent paying regular job in a different part of the world and live a healthier, more social, more balanced life.

tldr: Don't put too much importance on what you do for money.

p.s. sorry for the essay"

Telling friends and family about it really helps, as long as they're understanding.

All the best on your journey my friend!"
findapath,fk9swpb,t1_fk7e0jl,1583982845.0,"Yeah you're not wrong, I find the intersection between human civilization and the human experience fascinating. It's why I love exploring our different cultures and ways of life. I've thought about starting a YouTube channel for a while now. That's a goal I'm slowly working towards.

Agreed, life is most definitely not about money. Anyone who thinks it is is destined for disappointment. And yes in many cases college does not align very well with today's job market and is absurdly expensive. 

I really appreciate your kind words :)"
findapath,fk9iyk3,t1_fk7b0v2,1583976994.0,"Yeah I think that, in general, setting oneself a goal and working towards it regardless of your situation can be an effective (but not necessarily painless) antidepressant.

I've been to therapy before but it didn't seem to do much for me at the time. Perhaps I just need to find the right therapist?

Yeah I think I'm slowly coming to the realisation that a job is just that - a job. It's not your identity and it doesn't have to be the thing you live for.

I've told almost all my friends and family about my troubles and you're right, it really does help."
findapath,fk5urww,t3_fgoghe,1583888265.0,"I'm almost in the opposite position to you. I've essentially been in a loop of working low paying jobs to cover my solo trips overseas since I finished high school. 
I'm currently taking a break from travelling so I can focus on upskilling myself to break into the web dev field and get paid better money.
By the way, I'm 24 and have never had any fucking idea of ""what I want to do in life."" Personally I think that sentiment is bullshit. No one knows bro, all you can do is your best.
As far as I'm aware, life is just one big journey - one experience after the next. I say go for it, you'll have a beautiful, terrifying, life-changing experience that many people would be too afraid - too comfortable - to take a chance on.
Go and see the world bro, at 25 you're just getting started."
