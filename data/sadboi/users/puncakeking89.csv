Within kayfabe it does a lot to beat John Cena. That could launch someone to the top of the card. I was also referencing the WWE network subscriptions not WrestleMania attendance. 

Just out of curiosity, who would you give that spot to? Assuming we’ve already got the main event guys on the card, who replaces that match that would have been Cena. Or would you prefer the show to just be a bit shorter"

SquaredCircle,fhegz14,t1_fheft2u,1581522191.0,"1: Massive Draw. Like it or not Cena is a mainstream figure and if people see him on a card they will tune in. I can guarantee you that Smackdown will get a lot more viewers this week since they’ve announced Cena 

2: The other 16 years that he gave to the company. Should that not count for something? He is still helping that company by doing things outside of it, whether it be make-a-wish or just his face being out there. Cena is the WWE and when people see him that’s one of the things that come to mind 

3: Quality storyline potential. It could be the Fiend, Daniel Bryan, Corbin, Reigns, Aleister Black, Chad Gable, etc. Cena’s status as the companies golden child, a very good wrestler (in kayfaybe at least) and some pre-existing stuff with the Fiend and Bryan creates potential for very good stories heading into Mania.

4: He can most likely still go in the ring but not for much longer. He’s getting older plain and simple, he can’t work the WWE schedule even if he wasn’t acting and doing other shit. He’s only got a few matches left so I think it’s better to see him than not to. 

5: He’s John Fucking Cena, he’s going to have a Mania Match because he is John Fucking Cena."

I really wish the Fiend wasn’t champion because I’m interested in the story but I don’t want Cena challenging for a title at the moment. I’m also not to fond of seeing 25 AA’s and then a Mandible Claw. Maybe if they did a no DQ match and had Cena pushed to the edge by the fiend. I imagine a rehash if the Mania 30 match with the Fiend on his knees begging for John to hit him with a chair.  That could be cool"
SquaredCircle,fheezq9,t1_fheegsg,1581520960.0,Sounds good until the roll up. Olympic Slam for the win. Or even have Cena tap to the ankle lock. But you would have to build up Gable a bit more. He could come in first at elimination chamber and just barely lose.
