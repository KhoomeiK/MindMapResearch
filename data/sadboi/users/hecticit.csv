Music,epdntla,t3_bukybg,1559170057.0,"Hey Brian!  Big fan. Saw you at your Toronto Sweet290 show! And your Kinjaz Pod episode inspired me to pursue more creative projects outside of work. Now to the question: SLAB is one of my favourite R&B projects, and it happens to be your first project. You recently released LUV, which I find to have a very different feel and concept from your first release. Glue stands out to me as a new avenue of the genre youâ€™re exploring. Do you intend to do more songs like Glue/explore more varied genres?"
