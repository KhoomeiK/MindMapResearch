First 2 seasons with the original cast was so good. The last season (5) I got to a point where I was just sat there like ‘Why am I watching this? I’m not even enjoying it’ and I left it. I went back maybe a year later and finished it but first two seasons were the bomb, last season just bombed."

I used to use one with my lab because she would often get excited and try to make a dash to say hello and I didn’t want her running across a road (it happened once and she scared the life out of me) The positive is it your whole body weight becomes the anchor.

leicester,fozia3j,t3_gacw3t,1588191117.0,"Can recommend Woodhouse/Woodhouse Eaves. Countryside, 5 minutes to Bradgate Country Park and, 15 minutes to M1 and it’s gorgeous. Has a little shop, lots of pubs (4) and a school and a park. Down side is the bus service if you’ll be relying on it. It’s hourly and not very reliable and the keep cutting it back more and more as time passes. Apart from that it’s great. Lived there 15 years on and off.

Also Quorn, more on the bus route (has plenty and often) and is an beautiful village, it’s got pubs/few shops/park/schools (primary and academy)/ also a good chippy 😁

Also lived in Barrow-upon-Soar for a while. It’s a nice place, the river is a beautiful place to walk and it runs along the edge of the village. It can be a double edge sword though because it floods easily near by and it means all the traffic funnels through Barrow. It’s a very convenient place to live, regular busses and also it has a train station which can take you Leicester-Lincoln I think (never had to ride is as far as Lincoln but I think that’s the destination) so easy to commute to anywhere.

Out of these three places I would probably prefer to live in Barrow because it is conveniently close to main roads, it has a Co-op and a petrol station and I loved to walk the dog round the river. 

I currently live in another village close by and honestly it’s not that bad, I think most of the villages along the A6 between Loughborough and Birstal are a pretty good bet because they are close to everything but also have that village feel.

Good luck in your hunt"

A lot of the people I visit (predominantly the elderly) voted to, actual quote “keep the riff raff out”  and yet in the same breath they complain they are waiting weeks/months for doctor/hospital appointments - so many of out doctors etc are from abroad! It’s like they don’t actually link that it’s not just going to send the one guy you saw pretending to beg outside the supermarket to his home country, and that there’s actually a lot of people being tarnished with the same brush. 

It gets me so mad some people have actual hate for other people. That’s all it is really. People hating people, but it makes it ‘okay’ in their minds with their prejudices because the papers are saying “it’s okay so support these people hating people, let’s all be bigoted racists”"
