bipolar,fitej37,t3_f9q9ge,1582717210.0,"I worked in my college‚Äôs office like this. Students who received note taking did so on an anonymous basis! This is how it worked:

Student comes in, asks for notes to be taken for them and explains situation. 

They get approved or they don‚Äôt (99% of time they do). 

Coordinator in office sends email to professor saying they need a volunteer to be responsible for taking and bringing notes to the center. 

Professor makes announcement in class saying the same thing. 

Someone volunteers. 

Student receiving notes is assigned a number. Student taking notes is given that number. 

Student takes notes and brings a copy to the office, says ‚Äúthese are for #12‚Äù and leaves the office. 

Student receiving notes comes into the office weekly ish and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for notes for #12‚Äù and whoever is working the front desk gives the notes to them. 

So hopefully your center does it as anonymously as mine did. I didn‚Äôt even know the students names most of the time unless I knew them beforehand. Hopefully this eases some of your anxiety about the process!"
