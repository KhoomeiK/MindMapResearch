bipolar,fitej37,t3_f9q9ge,1582717210.0,"I worked in my college’s office like this. Students who received note taking did so on an anonymous basis! This is how it worked:

Student comes in, asks for notes to be taken for them and explains situation. 

They get approved or they don’t (99% of time they do). 

Coordinator in office sends email to professor saying they need a volunteer to be responsible for taking and bringing notes to the center. 

Professor makes announcement in class saying the same thing. 

Someone volunteers. 

Student receiving notes is assigned a number. Student taking notes is given that number. 

Student takes notes and brings a copy to the office, says “these are for #12” and leaves the office. 

Student receiving notes comes into the office weekly ish and says “I’m here for notes for #12” and whoever is working the front desk gives the notes to them. 

So hopefully your center does it as anonymously as mine did. I didn’t even know the students names most of the time unless I knew them beforehand. Hopefully this eases some of your anxiety about the process!"

There hasn’t been an easy solution for me, but I’ve started taking out a budgeted amount of cash for each week. I keep my card with me for true emergencies (like getting gas in the middle of nowhere, medicine for a migraine if I don’t have any on me) but otherwise if I’m out of cash, I just have to stop. It helps me plan ahead and prioritize too. 

Something I used to do with my sprees was start out small and just keep going. “What’s $5 on a coffee? It’s all good. Then it’s $12 at chipotle, still fine. Then it’d be exciting to get a new pair of pants for work, $25 later. Then I’m thinking, it’d be nice to have the new iPad so I can start making art again.” And it would go on and on.
