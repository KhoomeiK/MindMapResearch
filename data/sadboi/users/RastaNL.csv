I have been diving head first into anything concerning High Strangeness, hoarding resources on the topic from podcasts to books. As someone with a more Communications and Media centered background, I've been thinking about the UFO phenomenon both as a culturally formative entity as well as a culturally representative expression;

i.e. the influence of (pop)culture on the phenomenon and vice versa, as well as the perception of the phenomenon dependent on a culture.

The threads between religions and civilizations as shown in Hellier are an example of this and it was spiked in particular after listening to the Cryptonaut podcast (do recommend), where the hosts discuss obscure Cryptids while trying to place them in the context of the time and place when and where they were sighted.

The [Installation](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tileset_repository#Installation) section is very clear how to handle swapping out tile sets when using Vanilla. Any changes that need to be made to the raws you will find outlined alongside the specific tile set further down.

When I first started playing with different sets I liked to stick to something similar to the Vanilla style. Some of the Markavian sets are what I liked and I would recommend [this one](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/File:Markvii.png) as well as [this one!](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/File:Markx.png) The latter being my preferred of the two. [Taffer](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/File:Taffer_10x10.png) might also appeal to you if you like Vanilla.

After that I really started to like the Guybrush variants, like [this one](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/File:Guybrush_square_16x16.png).

For the last months however, I have been absolutely loving [Teeto](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/File:Teeto_K_18x18.PNG)'s set. Especially with the '[Another Natural Scheme](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Color_scheme#Another_natural_scheme)' color scheme!

dwarffortress,fi6swcf,t1_fi6rehi,1582206553.0,"The way I see it is as follows: 

Toady has a particular vision for DF and he is building from the foundation up to get as close as possible to that vision. Whether you are perfectly fine working with the UI as it is, you actually like ASCII or you are a purist that wants to experience DF as intended by the creators, Vanilla is where you go. It's also what I prefer but more so out of habit I guess.

Together, the Adams brothers can only work so hard on it however and their developer roadmap might differ from what some current players desire. Which is where the people behind LNP, DFhack, modders etc. come in. Whether you are after QoL improvements or complete overhauls, there will be something for you.

Personally I play Vanilla with a square tile set and a different color scheme. I have no huge qualms with the UI although this is definitely an area that can benefit from some improvement.

I kind of figured it would be a hard process technically from a technical perspective - the comments in the thread did a good job explaining as to why. I did come across some mention of using the two week advancement before and the thread you linked referred to that too, adding some interesting food for thought:  


>It is possible to run the world in its game play format without having  any active part in it: this is what happens during the 2 week embark  period, but as you may have noticed, it takes a lot longer than world  gen does, so while it's possible to extend the period (I believe it's  been done with DFHack manually, but not as a tool, by changing the end  date), you'd have to let the game run in the background for days to get  anywhere. 

So instead of say (ideally) a couple years per second in world gen, what could be achieved is perhaps several days per second of run time, which is at least something - that is to say if one can exploit and tweak the 2 week period."

Say for example; I generate a world, play fort mode for a couple years, kill of some adventurers, have one successful fort that I retire and which I would like to see develop over the course of say 50 years.

Would it technically be possible to even achieve that due to how DF is set up?

The free counsellor route really helped me, even despite the waiting list. I’d urge you to pursue that route if you feel up for it! Or you could search for talking groups within your university, if they have them;

There are a couple groups at mine as well as in my city, no fees unless there are beverages or food, and likeminded people that just check up on each other - kinda like this sub but physical and a bit more of a support structure. This also serves as a network to find the right therapist for some. Hope that’s helpful/those are around near you!

If you’re not comfortable with any of those and you have the means, see your regular doctor, it might feel like you’re going there to get a referral for a specialist but they often take the time to sit and listen and see what else they can provide you.

Also, if you feel like you aren’t being heard in your first couple conversations or consultations depending who you end up seeing; look for someone that makes you feel heard. Not only will it help you feel like you’re not alone, generally a feeling of being ignored is warranted- in my university for example, there is still a huge stigma around mental health among professors, some of them at least!"
depression,fctvus3,t3_eiwka4,1577962179.0,"First off: This is a great place to discuss and look for support but if you have any suspicions something might be going on, talk to a doctor or specialist!

This is somewhat similar to how things started for me but I had been in a slump prior to my sleep problems started. Yes it could be in part an expression of something you’re going through, but don’t pin yourself on depression before talking to someone.

Hope things get better for you!"
cassetteculture,fcr65h9,t1_fcqxc4e,1577897349.0,"If it is still available by the way, I’d be willing to check shipping and pay expenses depending."
cassetteculture,fcr1siw,t1_fcqxc4e,1577895523.0,Ooh interesting! Do those differ from the ordinary 510 models? I put out a bid on a 510 to try my hand at getting a cassette label going
cassetteculture,fcqvxxh,t1_fcqpnu8,1577893029.0,"Yep, I’ve been scouring online marketplaces for a while now and the only ones that get offered close are ‘for parts’ of at all. I love the Marantz brand ever since a friend showed me his double deck 4050 at his place."
cassetteculture,fcpzlvk,t3_eifh3d,1577875559.0,Ooh these are super rare to find where I am! That’s one on my list!
synthesizers,fahv9jr,t1_fahrwsg,1576094214.0,"Valid throughout and as I have come to realize I may have had my hopes up for a device that would fit the bill but doesn't actually exist (..within said price range).  
I have to say though: reading, asking, watching, searching and learning all of this has been very enjoyable; I haven't even touched any device yet and I'm already feeling more excitement than I have in a while.  


To your point, do I compromise with the potential to nickel and dime myself while running the risk I'm buying something I don't enjoy? That's definitely a risk and one I'm not sure I am willing to put my money toward. Although some people will say ""it's about the journey"" and I would agree with that, money is sadly finite and scarce.  


To wrap up, the Circuit seems to be the top suggestion so I'm reading up on that one; the Pocket Operators seem fun but now I'm questioning whether that is a money pit indeed; the MC-101 is pricy and I have not seen any near me that are cheaper than a second hand OP-Z which is a formfactor I find extremely interesting. It all boils down to how do I spend money wisely, I guess, and that needs some hard thinking.

Thanks again for your perspective, voice of reason!"
synthesizers,fahcaz7,t1_fah4io3,1576083388.0,"Thanks for your input, sounds like (and based on what I'm reading) the Circuit is pretty well regarded!  
And your point about the Volcas is indeed something I had noticed and have been thinking about;  
they don't seem to do as well on their own which is a big point on the negative side of the equation.  


While the MC-101 looks very interesting the price is indeed quite high for me at this point.  


Mostly I'm debating whether it would be worthwhile to just keep saving although that's gonna take significantly longer, but on the other hand grabbing a PO-33 for example would allow me to experiment with basic sequencing.. I guess? That's where my mind is at right now at least."
synthesizers,faf7pmb,t1_faf6rqt,1576016325.0,"I hear you, thanks! While the Circuit does appear to be bigger than the OP-Z, I would still consider it very much portable.  
I will do some digging and reading and ponder a bit, everyone has been quite helpful!  
I realize it will indeed be very subjective which unit fits the bill and I'm leaning towards the POs at the moment;  
as far as price, portability and formfactor go those appear to be solid choice which nobody explicitly dislikes as far as I can see.

Thanks again, it's been enlightening!"
synthesizers,faf79ca,t1_faf4xjj,1576016048.0,"I have seen that one pop up in a couple of lists but for some reason its description didn't grab my interest.  
Now that you got me looking into it, it does seem interesting!  
It packs quite a bit and it seems to be editable through PC?  
No polyphony if I'm reading it correctly?  
Do you have it and what are your impressions?"
synthesizers,faf3i3d,t1_faf2yzn,1576013755.0,"Thanks for that write up and taking the time to reply! Overall sound advice which resonates with the general advice I've been getting.  
I have been looking at the Circuit since it got first mentioned, as well as pondering the decision to just save even further towards an OP-Z.  
How portable would you say the Circuit is?"
synthesizers,faesi93,t1_faeprtd,1576007268.0,"Neat, sounds like both the Sample and the Bass are neat to fiddle around with!  
Might have to read up more on the Sample one :D Thanks again!"
synthesizers,faele23,t1_faekp4u,1576003082.0,"Sounds great, especially the point about workflow!  
I will definitely read up on this one but for now it looks like a strong contender, if I can find a used one."
synthesizers,fael2ap,t1_faek2tc,1576002907.0,"Great to hear it has a lot of variety (3k!!!) and MIDI controller support, that's neat and gives it some longevity if I want to take it further.  
I got some power banks around so that's definitely an option.  
Thanks for the NAMM heads-up by the way, I am in no hurry at this point so I might just wait it out to see whether something interesting comes out. Like you said, some other gear might come out which could make what you mentioned more affordable.  
Thanks, great tips!"
synthesizers,faekl66,t1_faeihq9,1576002655.0,"Second time the Sample gets recommended, taking note of that :D  
The Kaossilator looks like a fun little tool and is exactly the kind of gear I'd hope people would recommend actually.  
Have you used the Kaossilator yourself? If so, what for/how and what did you like about it?  
I'm gonna look into some hands-on vids about it, thanks!"
synthesizers,faek8c7,t1_faeiagh,1576002466.0,"Interesting, looks great at first glance. How responsive are the pads? I love the tactile look though.  
Battery powered so that's great, definitely gonna look for some second hand ones.  
What do you like most about it?"
synthesizers,faei8fo,t1_faeh207,1576001335.0,"I am not familiar with it but at first glance it does appear to fit what I'm looking for.  
What about the MC-101 makes you recommend it?  
And do you prefer it over something like the OP-Z?

Thanks!"
synthesizers,faei47a,t1_faegp2v,1576001266.0,"Thanks for your recommendations! Does the Sample come with a bank of sounds or is it entirely empty?  
What did you use the Volcas for?  
I agree however that it might be a better idea to work towards the OP-Z, stepwise or just sticking to saving."
depression,f9juutp,t1_f9jttg7,1575386329.0,"Is there anyone you feel comfortabel talking to?

It wasn’t until I broke down in front of my parents after months of pretending that they helped me find a therapist.

They set the appointments with my doctor and therapists and that’s what got it rolling for me.

Is this an option for you?

Not the breakdown part, I hope it doesn’t come to that."
depression,f9junbh,t1_f9jt860,1575386184.0,"I can understand that, sounds like you have a plan which is half the work already! I do recommend seeking council from a professional, it helps me, even if only on the days that I go visit mine sometimes. Other times it gets me through entire weeks. I sincerely hope you find someone that can connect and guide you!

As for joining a talk space, that’s not a bad idea at all and something I might look into as well. I know some universities organize them so that might be worth looking into as well? Although some are for students only, mine has a general walk-in slot now that I think about it.

It’s good to hear you have your husband to lean on at least, cherish that an be thankful. I’ve been too hard on my girlfriend at times and although she knows where it’s coming from, it hurts us both."
