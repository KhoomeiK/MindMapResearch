Inari, Konkon with the silly name is actually a great feel good show with a little romance that shows friendship between the shinto gods and humans. As such the aesthetics of the show is different and the art and characters are well done. The main theme stuck with me and exudes great calm and even though it's shorter than usual with 10 episodes, the plot moves fast and is entertaining enough. Fluffy and cute but with some slight drama sprinkled in. 

Somehow it also has the Seinen tag.

Did not expect this from such a show but it's a 8,5 for me (just love the main ost theme)."

anime,fqtlmpp,t1_fpyu6ji,1589641396.0,"I can think of a few reasons additionally (correct me if mistaken) :

* Popularity : as you've said anime seeks its audience to make itself likable and viewed and especially with Shonen shows aimed at young boys it's no wonder you have some sexual elements. 

*Otaku appeal : For trash LN series that target this demographic, well yes. 

* Culture : Western culture has long been pervaded by the judeo Christian religion which promotes a particular conservative view on sexuality. 
Meanwhile Japan doesn't seem to care. It seems like they think any sexual characteristic is the same as having a boon in a physical attribute, as if it was cool to do so. But that may just be Anime culture actually because real life isn't like this. 

*Anime culture : I think Miyazaki said this, but he remarked that the anime just copy between themselves their ideas until everything looks similar hence why some tropes got on because it was popular and they were trying to copy it, while ""losing touch with reality"" as he said."

When a Ti behaves like a non 5 that would throw you off your perceived stereotype and mislead you into typing.

The link given has another link that points to Better reasoning. And according to stats you can also say something much more precise.

9 in particular can be almost anyone except Te I guess. There are some combinations where it is very rare for a mbti type to be.

6 being Ti is curious, as Ti is typically a 5 and dislikes authority and questions it. The 6 fanatical theorist can be conflated with it. 

What's interesting is that you point out ENTJ can be 6 and that is not commonly expected even though it's literally written this way.

The only pattern I see is that (INTP example) 

Ti > Fe which is logical as your opposite gets triggered (or if Ne > Si).

Then he goes into the shadow which would be Te and Fi (5th and 8th) and he repeats the same process.

Or you could argue that after depleting the conscious you run to the unconscious of your ego which is Ti > Te and to the opposite of it, Fe > Fi (thus doing Ti > Fe > Te > Fi).

You can't Ti and Fi because that's literally the opposite, and this for each function. You need to think about this in a meta ontological way for how the function comes to exist and process and you'll see its pattern. 

This is the real reason why there is a cognitive mutual exclusion.

Besides you don't necessarily consciously use a function. You are already post processing it, and think about your function after you realize it due to awareness. You don't even get to choose.

And in a natural way, using Fi if you're a Ti dominant would not even cross your mind as you're unable to imagine that an entire dimension would coexist in the same space as your Ti, unless your study and you realize this.

Maybe, on a rare level you'd be able to utilize the function but that would only last a few seconds as you switch back to your mode, or in special circumstances."
