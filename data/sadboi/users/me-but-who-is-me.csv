intj,fpbuqxf,t3_gc9u7l,1588479235.0,I agree that social media platforms are the birthplace of anxiety... Can’t stop comparing myself to all those people who are all doing amazing things when I’m just a loser. But I’ve slowly learnt not to buy into this thought too much as it could really ruin my life.
