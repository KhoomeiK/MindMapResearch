Yerp, fuck, I have been thinking they are gonna break up with me at any moment. That’s ridiculous how alike that is. With communication: they kept getting HIGHLY defensive when I ask any question to clear shit up. It make me immediately distrust anything said after.

I don’t know if it’s a right fit anymore. She never once “rained me in” i said what you read but I assume she was more worried about my chronic Self blame than the actual truth of the disorder.

Best way to do it is find an artist you respect and like and see what shows they go to and you will know what’s good? Even then some artists won’t tell you for fear your a “crafty Karen” trying to find shoes to get into?

I’ve snipped a few of them for a few friends that were bothered by it but they didn’t like cleaning them out and they would get infected, so I understood that super easy process, little blood but healed in like 2-3 weeks forever."
gonewildpopping,fokjmuu,t3_g7sf8b,1587843294.0,My old boss had those! When the shop was slow we would put dangling garbage navel rings in um and make videos to send to his girlfriend. (I’m a body piercer and it got wierd during slow season often) They are little fistulas from you circumcision and your parents didn’t pull the skin back enough when you were a baby so yell at them. But you can run a earring through them to clean it out with little pain. But do film it!!!

ptsd,fohmh9i,t3_g7ddia,1587768419.0,"What my therapist explained to me is like the one thing fucked your shit up. so bc of the coping mechanisms that you’ve learned, sometimes more things just get piled on. Like I have my “big first ick” and then the other smaller Icks Maby wouldn’t be as bad but bc of the way my brain does it’s thing made it an actual ick instead of “something gross that happened”.  but like I just went through something like really really fucking traumatic, like holding my friends body parts together wile waiting for an emergency team to get there. But bc I practiced what my therapist taught me through cbt it’s not so bad brain wise? Or Maby in a few years I’ll wake up screaming about it also who the fuck knows. So yes. Maby no? But probably yes? 

Friend survived and is mobile for all you lovely folks that care. That also helps that they survived."

reptiles,foh434h,t1_fogxaj1,1587760303.0,"Hear, hear. I feel politics in the US have just gotten so incredibly polarized that people forgot that we’re all just grinding on eachother trying to survive. Now it feels like you either wanna kill all the baby’s or you wanna kill all the minorities. Like wat. Political Beliefs shouldn’t be all that. Shit is offensive. It got redick."
TwoXSex,fofyvxe,t1_fofksfu,1587745227.0,"Another thing to bring up is that 1 in 6 women in the us have been sexually assaulted and 1 in 9 have been sexually assaulted b4 the age of 18. That’s just women and not men. From what I understand is a lot of folks use ruff sex as a form of ownership of their sexuality or just good ol self harm. Don’t get me wrong some folks do ruff stuff right and consensual. But that’s not everyone. We have a real mental health situation here. And the usa is just awful to children. I hypothesize that that could also have to do with the up tick. 
But again kink is not always bad. It can be really amazing and fun. I’m sorry you were treated poorly tho."
AnimalsBeingGeniuses,fofv0se,t3_g72d25,1587743309.0,"My dog smashed into like 4 glass doors in a few weeks time when she was a pup, for a few years after she wouldn’t walk over any change in flooring unless you did first. Never needed gates on things. she would just shake and wine until you showed her it wasn’t glass. Equal parts convenient and least convenient."
offmychest,foeku1t,t3_g6xpxs,1587706464.0,"I have a similar situation, I’m sorry you understand. What helped me therapy first. Find something physically on you that you think is attractive. Just focus on that when you look in the mirror. Just look at that. Also know and someone said above, it’s noticeable at first, but when people get to know you, that stuff gose away. The people who care about you probably don’t see it. But you’ll learn all that in therapy. Start as soon as you can. Good luck comrade. You know first hand to be just so so kind to people."

tooktoomuch,fod0pow,t1_fobveao,1587678400.0,"Did you move into my old apartment in Chicago? I had the cops laughing so hard when my downstairs Nebor called the cops on me for vacuuming my floor, at 3pm on a Tuesday. They looked at the state of me (cleaning day clothes) and just went “you clearly at not having a kegger up here” I’ve heard her yelling at the garbage collectors for being too loud.... and she’s a freakin professor at a prestigious college. Like wtf."
houseplants,focj50q,t1_focgfz3,1587671933.0,"I used climist. I know you can diy it for cheaper but I will pay extra to not have to pay for the water damage if I had messed it up. I might try the diy on another apartment or when this one shits out. I’m very happy with the climist tho. I do recommend it. 

And yo, I have killed way more plants that are in there it’s been 3 years of tinkering. Figuring out what plants will do ok where, where the misters need to point, what pots will work best, what soil wont compact and how to keep drainage. And my god. Making sure you don’t get scale in there. Also everything has to be removable to clean properly bc with that misting system you can’t go bioactive or you will flood so you have to be able to clean. It’s so amazing now I have it dialed in but it’s been all trial and error. I only miss Facebook bc the reptile forums are so much more active and helpful than the reddit ones. But now that it’s all situated *kisses fingers 

But don’t feel bad. That’s what I was getting at."

I found that cbd/thc topicals really help and make the inflammation go down much quicker but it’s treating the affects not the situation. I just don’t have health insurance to cover dr visits, America #1 am I right?"
