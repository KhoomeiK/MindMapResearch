He could also set up a Gear that has something to do with his nervous system, which would somehow rubberize his nerves, and since pain sensation could be said to travel to the nerves via some minor electrical signals, he could maybe control his sense of pain.

From the very start, people seem to forget the whole idea of Black Mirror itself was always the effects of technology to society. The wtf (plottwists) moments within it weren't always present or as extreme as they had in mind (recall to waldomoment and be right back). Those saying otherwise are just another ""BlackMirror-episode-waiting-to-happen"" kind of fans who somehow can't differentiate because of their obsessions."
