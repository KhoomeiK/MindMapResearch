Ashwagandga and Rhodiola can be taken together but don't start them at the same time. One week the first to see how it goes and next week start the other. Usually they take some time to work 

Valerian root is a sleep aid but taking it long term can create dependency. It's usually a supplement for specific rough nights

Don't start 2 supplements at the same day. If you have side effects you will not know which one caused it
