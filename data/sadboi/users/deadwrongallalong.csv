deadmalls,fqt8eov,t1_fqsvs2b,1589633028.0,"I only walked through the mall in its entirety one time back in October. Maybe it was because I was alone in a new place for the first time but I felt a bit anxious and on edge. It definitely has the makings of a dead mall. I don‚Äôt remember where the Auntie Anne‚Äôs was, but I remember a fair number of vacancies down by Dicks, although the public washroom at that end was surprisingly nice. I entered through the mall entrance outside Macy‚Äôs and the Bonefish Grill and remember how bright and grand it was, but I definitely also remember how.. 90s it looked haha and the vacant little takeout shops outside Macy‚Äôs. And the old Hollister storefront that‚Äôs now a comic book store or something like that.

Anyway, after that visit I returned to the mall a few more times but entered through JCP because the only thing worthwhile for me is the Sephora inside. The main draw for me in that area is Trader Joe‚Äôs, Target and Ulta just to the north. I cannot wait until the border opens up again. Watching dead mall content on YouTube and now talking about Boulevard Mall makes me want to walk around the whole place again."
deadmalls,fqrtcqh,t3_gkjyxq,1589591476.0,"Bummer. I live in Canada so we don‚Äôt have JCP here, but I‚Äôve been to two different ones in the states. I remember being underwhelmed one my first visit to the one in Millcreek Mall in Erie PA - it seemed like a lower end version of our Hudson‚Äôs Bay, even though there is decent overlap in brands carried. The other one I‚Äôve been to a couple more times, at Boulevard Mall in Amherst NY. I would be sad to see it go, because that‚Äôs where I stock up on US exclusives from Sephora - if it wasn‚Äôt there I‚Äôd have to go all the way to Walden Galleria. I suppose it doesn‚Äôt matter too much to me atm since the border is closed for recreational visits"

Cancelled shows:

* KSE, ABR and Light the Torch in Toronto in April 6
* Counterparts w/ SeeYouSpaceCowboy in Toronto on May 15

Currently up in the air:

* Slipknot, Underoath, ADTR and Code Orange in Toronto on June 6
* The Ghost Inside in Worcester, MA on July 11
* Parkway Drive Viva the Underdogs Tour in Toronto in September 7

If I really expected WCAR to be my last tour I would‚Äôve tried to enjoy it more. It was an amazing show and I had a nice time but I was feeling a little off and didn‚Äôt get into it as much as I would‚Äôve liked to.

I was most looking forward to TGI and PWD this summer. Even if TGI can happen, I have to travel from Toronto to Boston and that seems dicey right now. I‚Äôm so excited for their new music but at the same time I‚Äôm so upset at the thought of not being able to see them. I was also SO hyped for PWD, I even splurged and bought a VIP ticket and this time around I wanted to be in the crowd crying and singing along to Carrion and losing it to Absolute Power. If PWD has to postpone their NA tour that would be the biggest disappointment... after seeing their documentary and knowing how much work, time, money, effort and planning goes into a tour like that... having to postpone and reschedule would be such a setback and logistical nightmare, especially in regards to the pyro aspect."
