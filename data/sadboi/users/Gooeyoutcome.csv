BipolarSOs,fh4zn9h,t3_ezse8m,1581283626.0,"It's hard work managing a mental illness. Even when it's going alright, the hard work never stops. Can't miss medications or therapy. I can't stop going to the gym or stop eating healthy. I can't stay up really late. I can't drink more than a beer or two every so often. I have to follow my routine as best as I can. I need to dull or soften triggers to mitigate potential damage. 
I need to keep those closest in the loop of any changes. 
It's funny reading what I wrote but that is similar advice you'd give anyone that wants to remain healthy, not just someone struggling with mental illness. 
Maintaining all of that in a depressive episode is like running up a steep hill with a bag of bricks on my back but it has to be done. 
The positive about my post is I do all of this even when I don't want to or can't and it's enough for those around me and my partner. I put the effort in and I get a little help along the way when I need an extra push. It makes a difference. It's a disease so fight it like one. Fight. 

And if you can't fight, have a plan to get yourself in a place where you can get help. Keep a big out bag ready and get yourself to the professionals. There is always one more thing you can do for yourself."
