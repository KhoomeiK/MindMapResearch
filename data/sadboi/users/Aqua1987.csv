wewantcups,fpyb2gn,t1_fk0aob1,1589000206.0,Off topic question...When you post this with the r/ what is the purpose?
wewantcups,fpya5mw,t1_fk2ew8s,1588999521.0,Where are you from?
NoStupidQuestions,fpxwg2n,t1_fpux9wu,1588990971.0,"You are right, attraction is a reaction we have when we see something/someone we admire. 

This would be a response to a preconceived idea of what is admirable depending on your frame of reference for what is attractive which comes from your inventory of ideas in your mind according to your thoughts which you choose to accept or reject."
NoStupidQuestions,fpxv8n6,t1_fpupp46,1588990266.0,"Yes, I agree with you. 

You've either at some point already rejected the idea of being attracted to men or you decided to be attracted to women, whatever the case, you made a choice and that is my point."
NoStupidQuestions,fpxeyta,t1_fpuq6qy,1588981389.0,"Those are really questions that would have to be thought hard about and answered honestly by those individuals you mentioned because the answer lies in what thoughts they chose to accept and/or reject initially prior to labeling themselves as such. Also, what they chose to spend time thinking about would make a difference.

I once heard someone say about thoughts, ""Just because a bird flies over your head, doesn't mean it has to nest in your hair."" While a thought may enter your mind, you have to choose to accept it, just because it's in your mind for a moment that doesn't mean that is who you are.

Labeling is another issue that ties people to all sorts of things. Once a person labels themself as something, they take on the belief that that is who they are, whatever it is (these actions/these thoughts) and then move in that direction, and tend to have confirmation bias."
NoStupidQuestions,fpunrbu,t3_gfgeo0,1588917974.0,">So, I believe, like most people, that we are born straight, gay, bi or whatever you are into.

Is this our culture now... What most people believe? I don't believe this. 

I believe you choose what you are attracted to, you do this with the thoughts you choose to have."

bipolar,fn20j90,t3_fyopvw,1586574683.0,I believed I was going to win the election for Sheriff against the man that had been Sheriff for 12 yrs running. I thought that he wanted to kill me and was sending police to herrass me and try to get me put in jail so I couldn't win the election.
