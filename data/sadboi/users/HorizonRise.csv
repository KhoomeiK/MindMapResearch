borderlands3,flslgst,t1_fls140v,1585444851.0,Yeah but it would be a rewarding system for the people who play legit without cheating. They should add the annoitment rerolls as well tho it would be nice if they did something about an alternative way to level up guardian rank
borderlands3,flrx0hb,t1_flrph3w,1585429649.0,"Yeah the scaling is way better this time around, honestly all the game needs at this point is several raid bosses, a new ultra rare rarity, unique drops from the trials, farmable side quest bosses that drop side quest uniques and an npc that lets you trade eridium to level up and add bonus stats to your guardian rank"
borderlands3,flros8a,t3_fqocdj,1585424654.0,Yeah they are adding cool content which the game desperately needs but they also removed so many things from borderlands 2 they have to make up for.. The game still has less replay value than borderlands 2s base game.

borderlands3,fits0gk,t1_fitdljo,1582728087.0,"They could make it similar to bl1 where they only drop from certain loot sources but a bit different like handsome jackbot has a 1/10000 chance of dropping a specific pearl shotgun so if your farming him for the craps or class mods or just farming the loot room you would always have a chance of looting that ultra rare pearl shotgun off him while doing casual farms, they could also make certain pearls random world drops and others only obtainable in the trials, sure its Rng yeah but it adds more to the game and gives you more stuff to loot once you’ve gotten all the legendaries you need"
borderlands3,fitr9oj,t1_fitdiuw,1582727593.0,They could add all the op weapons from bl2 & pre sequel make them pearls and maybe make some average ones too that are fairly better than legendaries but have crazy bullet patterns like a pearl tongue sniper that shoots different sized/colored firework explosions every shot. It would just be really fun too farm for them and get that sense of accomplishment where it’s above all your legendaries and your like hell yeah I finally got it. I think most borderlands players can relate too that feeling lol
borderlands3,fitqd2n,t1_fitdiyo,1582726980.0,"I hope they add pearlescents, they could do all the op weapons from bl2 but make them pearls like the bee, norfleet, sandhawk, harold, grog nozzle, pimpernail and maybe some new ones that aren’t super op but have cool effects even if they are trash they would be worth farming just to have a cool ass rare gun haha"

borderlands3,fe2sbw8,t1_fe1xd19,1578842365.0,"What I meant was in mmorpgs there are ways to get past the mobs and in other instances the ones you needed to kill to progress certain parts you don’t need to kill them again. Like ffxiv, wow, tibia. The respawning enemies part I don’t know why I was thinking of that but it would be nice if once you made it to Wotan all the doors would stay open leaving you to run past the mobs if you just wanted to book it to test out a raid boss build real quick"

borderlands3,fe07avy,t1_fdw3f8u,1578804945.0,"It’s cool until you have beaten it a couple times, the fact you can’t kick back relax and go farm a raid boss and test out your hundreds of builds sucks. If you want to make a new build and test it you have to kill hundreds upon hundreds of troops just to test it and there is no guarantee you will make it too the boss especially if your using a boss Type only build and not a mob build or hybrid build. The idea is good but it gets old quick considering the mobs don’t drop unique loot. If it was possible to run past the enemies straight to the boss everyone would do it. If they dropped unique loot then most people would stay and kill the enemies on the way to the boss. 

What I’m suggesting is they either make it so you can change the scale or skip the trash mobs because it has major faults how it is now honestly"
borderlands3,fe06mdh,t1_fdvvjkw,1578804391.0,"Yeah once you have beaten them a certain amount of times they should stop respawning just like a raid in an mmorpg once it’s cleared they don’t respawn. Sometimes people just want to go relax and test out builds on raid bosses and see what’s best, it’s fun. With this raid you can’t do that, you have to waste time fighting guys you have beaten countless times just to accidentally down yourself with a grenade and have to kill them all over again."

borderlands3,fdvt8bw,t1_fdvsapu,1578751200.0,The boss should but the trash mobs are the main concern. If you could skip to the boss once you beat it once it would be cool but having to run through hoards of bullet sponges sucks
borderlands3,fdvo2kt,t1_fdvng0k,1578749519.0,I read on the site that they said ‘we will be discussing new content such as dlc and level cap increase in the near future’
borderlands3,fdvn8f5,t1_fdvlte6,1578749340.0,"It’s a pretty reasonable guess, I would say by April or May it will be out. It shouldn’t have been scaled to 4 players to begin with, it would be cool if we could skip the trash mobs once you got to Wotan but the fact you have to waste time killing guys you have already proved yourself too is kinda dumb, even in mmorpgs the mobs stay dead meaning you can run back to the boss without having to clear it again"

ShouldIbuythisgame,fdjxvng,t3_el5zg8,1578490931.0,"Borderlands 2, probably the best fps rpg ever made. Hundreds of bosses to farm, pretty much everything in the game has a unique rare drop, so much dlc that combined is triple the length of the base game, and last but not least lots of raid bosses that have their own specific rare loot and the best part is you can do it all solo no multiplayer ever required. Thousands of hours of replay value guaranteed. Great game."

borderlands3,fbm0jal,t3_edn6sd,1576975094.0,I don’t know I guess I am getting kind of worked up over there not being traditional raid bosses but it would be nice if gearbox announced them not being in the game and dlc since we pretty much thought they would just keep the same formula with it suddenly changing. The new rarity’s are just cool and yeah the pearls were never as good as oranges but they were really fun to farm and collect considering how rare they were
borderlands3,fbkj1w9,t1_fbiy4uv,1576951150.0,"Your right 3 does have more main line story boss fights but they are all equally easy compared to warrior, bunker, Wilhelm, and bloodwing. Like if you want to fight something that drops insane amounts of loot and is a raid boss in terms of bullet spongeyness and difficulty you have 2 in the base game and 2 more in the pirate dlc along with a new rarity so that’s 4. Compared to bl3 which only has 1 in the takedown. It just feels like gearbox is holding out on purpose and leaving out this stuff that needs to be in game. If more fans spoke up and got more vocal saying we need raid bosses and hard content they would release it faster and make it a priority but if we don’t say anything it will take till 2021 to get even half of the content borderlands 2 had and that’s not okay. It doesn’t matter if they release a few bosses that are bullet sponges as their gimmick that’s what the game desperately needs along with a new rarity and they can fix them along the way with their weekly nerf and hotfixes"

borderlands3,fbkgvx3,t1_fbiujfl,1576950145.0,That is a good idea but honestly they should have kept the original classic raid bosses and added the new dungeon like mmorpg raids as well it would have been perfect with both
borderlands3,fbkgfz6,t1_fbivvtt,1576949939.0,"Wow you need to chill out your calling names and throwing insults towards me because I said my opinion of a video game I think your the one that’s needs to go outside, I am just stating whats wrong with the game. The takedown should have been in the godforsaken base game from the start along with the boss in ascension bluff but instead we got an empty beta test arena instead. We gave them 7 years I think they should have had some raid bosses ready by now. Borderlands 2 proved they can create fun raid bosses along with an amazing dlc in one package, the problem I have is they actually tried on borderlands 2 to release all that could release to make it the best game possible. Now they are purposely leaving out key components of the game and forcing us to wait long amounts of time to get the bosses that should have been in the base game and dlc from the start. Maybe if we spoke up towards gearbox they wouldn’t do this to us that’s the point of my post"

borderlands3,fb9asvo,t1_fb8yjua,1576633787.0,Yeah I’ll be happy with as much as the pirate dlc which was 2 raids and a new rarity but like you said any less will be extremely disappointing. I do expect them to have more content than the pirate dlc cause that was 7 years ago on last gen

If you are this depressed and feel that empty inside maybe you should try praying to god and put your faith in Jesus because that is the reason we are here in this world in the first place. Try asking for gods help you will be surprised how he will help you and how much he cares, just don’t kill yourself. You have come this far in life and too throw it all away because of a voice in your head is saying everything will be better when your dead is a lie, I have heard it too and it’s not yourself talking, think of it like the devil and an angel on your 2 shoulders 1 on your left and 1 on your right. The devil putting thoughts into your mind making you want to die but you have to tell it to fuck itself and say to yourself I have come this far and remind yourself how strong you are daily. The mind is a powerful thing just don’t listen to the bad voice saying everything will be better if you kill you self because I swear on everything nothing will be better an it’s probably one of the worst thing a human could ever do.. you will be okay I promise.
