Him and my great-grandmother had 6 kids during the depression and apparently my great-grandmother put him in prison for molesting 4 of the 5 girls. That would explain why my grandmother ran away from home, got pregnant with my mom, and married at 16. Also, my great-grandmother liked to move around a lot and change her name and SS # frequently during the 20's. She would take out bank loans in these false names and open restaurants and brothels in the northern towns of Arizona. As soon as the creditors would come calling, she'd move again and change her name and open another restaurant or brothel. Her history is becoming soo difficult to track!"
