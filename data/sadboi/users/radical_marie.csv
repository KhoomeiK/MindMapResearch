But I wouldn’t ever double text unless I’m in a serious relationship, and with that yes sometimes they never text back. It really sucks and it’s going to feel hard not to try again lol, but just find someone else to put your time towards. I also won’t change plans for the first couple times if something is going on. For example if I want to go to the gym on Saturday and they ask if I’m free, I say no. I could just move that but I have to consciously tell myself not to, and I suggest a different date."
BPD,f0dojtw,t3_d4kika,1568556736.0,"BPD is USUALLY devolved through childhood trauma, I say usually in all caps bc it really is a newer personality disorder that they’re still finding out a lot with. If you think you have BPD I 100% recommend just going to a psychologist, I would steer away from psychiatrist bc it’s not medication that is going to help. Psychiatrists in the past have tried to put me on all sorts of things, but I didn’t start feeling actually more stable until I started seeing a therapist twice a month. They basically help rewire unhealthy thought processes, if that makes sense. BPD can get really bad and the only solid evidence of people overcoming it have come out of therapy."

BPD,etl1p3f,t3_cc6n0t,1562917237.0,"So I self harmed pretty constantly from 12-21, and I’m 24 now, it’s terrifying those moments when it feels like you’re gonna relapse. But trust me, I have permanent scars down my arms and thighs and I’ve been slowly getting beautiful tattoos over them. It’s been helping me not self harm bc I don’t want to ruin the beauty. But I suggest finding something that can be an avenue. Also if you do happen to relapse, talk to someone about it immediately, I know it’s hard. But you need to remember if you do relapse then it doesn’t mean that you’re slipping back into old habits, you just made one mistake. You got this, don’t give up!"
BPD,etl18jk,t3_cc7nwu,1562916636.0,"So you’re not going to be able to feel amazing 100% of the time, no one does. I think when we have BPD it makes us so scared when we feel anything neutral/negative, that we try and push it away which makes the crash even worse.
I recommend when you start feeling that way try and see if it’s just a neutral feeling that your putting negative attributes to, and if that may be it then learn to relax into those neutral moments bc they can end up giving you more energy for highs if you enjoy them. And if it is a bad emotion then try and embrace it for a bit, let yourself sit and think about it. If it starts to get bad then find a way to distract yourself (I watch funny tv shows that I love or play video games), and then revisit it when you feel a little stronger."

BPD,etj365j,t3_cbxil6,1562865285.0,"I know it’s hard just keep going to therapy and tell him/her all of this. One thing I highly recommend is you have to keep it together around your kid. While talking about the past with my therapist we realized that my mom being overly emotional with me was one of the things that contributed to my BPD. It put me into a position to take care of her when I needed someone to be there for me. But like I said, just keep talking through with your therapist, and if you don’t feel like it’s getting better then you should ask to be recommended to someone else. I would make more frequent appointments and see if temporary anti anxiety meds could help you."
