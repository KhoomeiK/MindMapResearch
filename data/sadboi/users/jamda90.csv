BakingNoobs,fn5mp2d,t3_fzkind,1586669144.0,The spinach gives it such a lovely color. I would never think to bake with it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

WomensHealth,fmag6it,t3_fto2av,1585893063.0,"I went through the same thing with a colposcopy. There were some unusual cells that looked pre-cancerous, but the biopsy was normal. You may have to have more routine  PAPs for the next couple of years, and then once you have three normal screenings your doc may tell you that you don‚Äôt have to go in as often. As for the colposcopy, just prepare for a little cramping afterwards. Nothing some Advil and a heating pad can‚Äôt fix. Best of luck."
WomensHealth,fmafxi9,t3_fti6w5,1585892833.0,"I find that mixing in the hygiene ‚Äúchore‚Äù with something more enjoyable helps. For example, brushing and flossing my teeth while listening to some new music. Or, listening to some relaxing music in the shower, or brushing my hair while watching some late night TV clips can be helpful. Also, remember that you can decide what time of day works best for you- you might find that showering at night helps you sleep and then it‚Äôs one less thing to do in the morning. 

You can do this, and as you add on each task, it will slowly become part of a more automatic routine."
BravoRealHousewives,fl0tgj6,t1_fkzw2q2,1584715368.0,"10/10 agree, it is absolutely cringey"
BravoRealHousewives,fkzvptv,t1_fkzsagf,1584681852.0,"I tend to agree, but I think it comes from a place of her being uneducated/not terribly sophisticated. She doesn‚Äôt realize that it comes across as being small-minded, so I can‚Äôt fault her for it. I say this as a Jewish woman who‚Äôs spent years hearing my Goya friends say they want to marry ‚Äúnice Jewish boys.‚Äù It‚Äôs ignorance. Not malice."

weightlossdiets,fem7o61,t3_eptea0,1579242715.0,Rice cakes - you can put some almond butter on them or peanut butter. Or try some cottage cheese for when you have a refrigerator.
Seattle,fe0e1v9,t1_fdpto0j,1578811455.0,10/10 yes. Grew up here and moved to Syracuse NY. First snow storm I immediately was drawn to buying bananas inexplicably. I was the only one at Wegmans buying them.

femalefashionadvice,f7dtifb,t3_dviu1z,1573629236.0,"This is a worthwhile exercise, and reading your reflections on your own clothing made me think about what I already own. Keep doing it please! It is useful to pause and think about why we aren‚Äôt wearing the items we own- and notice the small imperfections that might keep us from wearing them at one time or another. Also posing the question- ‚Äúwhy am I keeping this?‚Äù Is it because I just haven‚Äôt gotten to wear it as much as I wanted to, like your beautiful slip dress? 

(SJP wore an especially beautiful one in an episode of season 5 of SATC that I‚Äôve loved since i was 14- still searching for the perfect one!)"

WomensHealth,f63mglu,t3_dqedlf,1572679844.0,Interesting- I don‚Äôt have endometriosis my understanding is that orgasms typically help with awful cramps because they somehow aid the process of shedding the uterus lining- something about contractions and prostaglandins- the mechanism that causes cramps in the first place.
nevertellmetheodds,f5zkizu,t1_f5xpqyl,1572579158.0,No- just as in- that‚Äôs the kind of stuff we learned about every damn Saturday at Torah study/Jewish history.

WomensHealth,exne8fa,t3_ctorql,1566453376.0,Your body may be in overdrive from a higher level of hormones than it‚Äôs used to. I‚Äôm inclined to say it won‚Äôt mess with your fertility long term but if you‚Äôre having unusual bleeding in the next few days- I suggest calling your gynecologist and speaking with a nurse. Usually they don‚Äôt lecture and will give you the straight answer of whether you need to come in or not.

mentalhealth,etoq4bs,t3_ccqdsm,1563034633.0,"It is normal, and in my experience, it will fade once you start to feel happier. In the meantime, be conscious of the relationships you have that are positive- even coworker‚Äôs or acquaintances who show you goodwill or kindness."
loseit,esmokxk,t3_c8gbfi,1562110608.0,"This shredded chicken has helped me a lot because it‚Äôs easy and can be used on salad that I never get tired of- or in taco bowls.
