Sciatica,fqxfnhb,t3_glgcek,1589731560.0,"Plain old white belt here, I havenâ€™t been able to train for 3 months due to a similar issue with my sciatic nerve on my left side. I feel for you matey. I can imagine your life is on hold right now and the future may seem uncertain but i whole heartedly believe that someone like you with a strong commitment to fitness and wellbeing will bounce back and find great ways to keep your back strong in the future. Wishing you the best! Thanks for all the info."
Nuraphone,fp5fvv7,t3_gbf08m,1588327868.0,I havenâ€™t bought mine purely due to the fact that after 2 years the battery life wonâ€™t be what it once was. You may get another year out of them but for the sake of Â£12 a month i feel i would rather get a fresh pair. But i can totally understand wanting to just get the purchase made.

pebble,f3p4vxg,t1_f2vmnrz,1571043729.0,Just as a response to this. It actually held its charge for 5.5 days. It just totally lied about how long was left each time i looked. Strange!
pebble,f2vtr0v,t1_f2vmnrz,1570457285.0,Ahh right. Great thank you so much! I imagined that possibly the software was lying to me but alas my battery is fizzling out :( I am happy to charge it every 3 days. It's still pretty much a day longer than the current big name watches out there. Cheers for taking the time!
pebble,f1z7p0u,t3_d8xyh6,1569837453.0,"Hi there. I had a similar problem and this fixed it. 
Wait for the battery to completely run out, like totally dead. 
Hold UP. SELECT. BACK buttons all at the same time then connect the charger but keep buttons pressed. Mine just started up as normally. Found this fix on a youtube video. Hopefully it can help you."
FitnessMotivation,eyqqbwu,t3_cy7ctk,1567350767.0,Good luck! Remember that you can achieve any shape you want. You just got to put that work in!  ðŸ’ªi wish you the very best.

The guy does strange stuff. He did some resin lego men with mouse hearts in them where a heart would go and also mouse balls where the lego mans balls would go. Mad stuff."

PublicFreakout,eu7gjym,t3_cf0e41,1563530825.0,I used to work for the company that runs this place. It's in Alton towers in the UK i believe. You are supposed to ask them to stop filming but you really don't get paid enough to piss around with people.
Anxiety,eu7ga0x,t3_ceu91n,1563530511.0,I'm British and we do this impulsively as part of our culture. It is more of an acknowledgement than an apology. Like if you rub against someone on public transport you say sorry just to acknowledge that you know they are there and you aren't being threatening in any way. Maybe we're all anxious?
science,et5d1ha,t3_c9ysls,1562470282.0,All i see is these scientific studies on it constantly. How about just listening to millions of people all over the world?

fatlogic,esw98vi,t1_esw958c,1562311136.0,"Just to add, i smoked for about 11-12 years"
fatlogic,esw958c,t3_c93h34,1562311096.0,I stopped smoking 230 days ago. Cold turkey as they say. It was bloody hard to do but i absolutely wanted to do it 100%. I don't want to sound like a self help book but the truth is that if you really want to quit then you can. It requires a lot of self control. But due to that self control i can now smell food again. Hot diggity damn. I stopped missing cigarettes after about 100 days or so.
CryptoCurrency,erjcoln,t1_erif2t6,1560923661.0,I will learn from your wise words crypto-san! Thank you!
CryptoCurrency,eria6on,t3_c1zlny,1560892842.0,I sent money from a bitcoin cash address to a bitcoin regular address and it didn't appear. And all the retrieval methods make no sense to my brain. Why am i so fu**ing old? I must learn currency before i use currency.
