relationship_advice,foevrkj,t1_foevpuq,1587716471.0,We were expecting a child and I couldn’t afford to raise it alone nor did I want to. I ended up losing it but we decided to stay together.
relationship_advice,foevmlp,t1_foevkzu,1587716334.0,... I am one step ahead of you. Just wanted to make sure I wasn’t the only one thinking this. lol

relationship_advice,fng8tm5,t1_fng8p5s,1586925207.0,"Trust me haha we talk about it. Like every week. His parents have been very clear and upfront about how much they dislike me and never want to see me or us together. He knows I want marriage and long term commitment, it is part of why they dislike me. They do not think he is marriage ready. Maybe he’s not but if he feels that way HE should tell me, not them."
DannyGonzalez,fng6ruk,t3_g1g3e7,1586923700.0,I thought the same thing!! Wish I had posted it now. I thought I was the only one!
relationship_advice,fng24ir,t1_fng18z8,1586920544.0,"I don’t think so but I’m probably biased. He’s grown a lot as a person. He’s gained a lot of respect for himself and gotten better about self harm (to the point where he’s been clean for months). I think his parents view his self respect increasing as his respect for them decreasing. (But that is NOT the case!) I have told them many times that I have no ill intentions and that I love their son, he loves me, and I have nothing but respect for them- but they don’t care to hear it. I feel so bad. I wish I could prove to them I just want the best for him."
relationship_advice,fng1qc1,t1_fng18pe,1586920280.0,Thanks dude. I’m trying my hardest. He has been giving it his all recently which is great. But I feel like I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I’ll try to be hopeful and maybe things can work!!
relationship_advice,fng1hcw,t1_fng1557,1586920116.0,"Hopefulness that one day he will? Lack of self respect? He’s the first guy I’ve ever been in a serious relationship with, I always assumed it would work out."
relationship_advice,fng110m,t1_fng0u1o,1586919820.0,"They just were never fans of me from the start. I’m very independent (my parents and I are more like friends than parent/child) and I encouraged him to be independent too. He’s was always a shy, introverted kid so I think they are used to him answering to their every call. When we started dating that stopped and they did not like that. Lol."
