I had a good friend of 7 years that I really wanted to fuck. Decided one day I was gonna go for it. But neither of us were single. So I broke up with my gf of one year, got into my good friend's head and gained her unwavering trust, got her to break up with her boyfriend of 3 years over a small fight, asked her out, got rejected, then I stopped talking to her because I wasn't interested in just friendship, then I got back together with the gf I broke up with initially. As far as I know my former good friend's life is still in shambles. The guy I convinced her to break up with has moved on. My GF and I just hit 3 years and are thinking about marriage. So yeah.

Particularly to alcohol. Genetics, social circles, and even ethicity plays a part it also isn't always ""I drank to the point of being a bum."" The hard part 

Alcoholism is a prominent trait in my family tree and when I was in my late teens/early twenties I developed a drinking problem. It didn't start with me being blackout drunk every night. It started with me just partying with my friends a few nights a month. Then it gradually became me having a few drinks by myself at home, then a lot of drinks by myself at home. Eventually I was blacked out a few nights a week, and I was always hungover. Noone besides my closest friends even realized I had a problem. I was getting rapid promotions at work, I was in a committed relationship, and all my bills were getting paid. At my worst I was going through two bottles of whiskey and 3 six packs a week. I never drank with people at that point. This was just me sitting at home chilling. 

It didn't destroy my life or anything but it was definitely an addiction. One that took a few years of not paying attention to get bad. I still drink, but it's a very rare thing (see: less than 10 times a year) and even then I only have one or two because it's easy as fuck to slip back into it. It's hard to say no. That's where the willpower comes in. Being in recovery is hard and unless you have done it yourself or someone very close to you has done it, you can't understand the amount of willpower a sober alcoholic has."

It's horrible and we hate it, but it's allowed us to only pay 240 each for rent which is unbelievably cheap in my area. It allows us to save a bunch of money, pay a bunch of debt off, and (don't tell Dave) sometimes we do fun things like buy a new game or go out to eat.
