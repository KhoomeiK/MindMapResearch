Your friend leaving just shows they didn’t truly care about you to begin with and it’s hard to see the blessing in that now, but in time you will. Wow that sounds horribly cliche but it’s true."

And exactly just remind yourself of all the cons, and how the high will never be as good as when you first started. Cravings are 100% normal and they come and go that’s normal, but the longer you go without the more of an after thought. I’ve found that if I have a craving and I just distract my self for 20/30 minutes with something positive I enjoy it passes."

relationship_advice,fno11h3,t1_fno07lj,1587108204.0,"Well I would just voice your concerns to him but don’t overreact until he gives you a reason too, like for example hiding the depth of the friendship, or spending to much time with her in person once they meet. I know a lot of people to do have completely platonic gaming friends, but someone so close to home could turn into something else. Also the present even tho it was small does seem a little much for such a new friend."
relationships,fno0ojv,t3_g2ww2n,1587107852.0,"As someone who is a heroin addict currently in recovery, all I can say is 1) most people think they can quit until they actually try 2) if he’s already addicted be prepared for him to care about and love the drugs more then you, it won’t be on purpose but that’s always the case, I have burned so many bridges and lost the love of my life because I couldn’t stop using and when given an ultimatum I chose the drugs. I have yet to meet an addict who cares about anything more than the drugs and if they say otherwise I guarantee they are lying. 3) all this doesn’t necessarily mean he can’t or won’t stop but he won’t be able to do it on his own or without hitting a rock bottom where he realizes his way of life is unmanageable, if you plan to be there for him just make sure you take the steps necessary to protect yourself and mental health, also consider checking out resources such as nar-anon (support group for family and loved ones).

I know you want to cry, but it seems like you are already pretty depressed (just my assumption I could be wrong) and from personal experience that level of deep depression sometimes makes it hard to cry. I would try to not focus on crying just focus on the memories you have of him and on taking care of yourself so you can go forth and have a full life for him. The tears will come when you are ready."
