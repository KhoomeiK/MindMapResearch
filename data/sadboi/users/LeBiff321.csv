Also the halucinations are apparently very random and the effects make music sound like a mess of random notes and tones. So as a musician I don't know why you would want to try it lol.

I was telling him about how I'd just had all new brake pads and disks fitted so the brakes where pretty sharp. As soon as the words left my mouth my friend grabbed the hand brake (with both hands) and yanked it up as far as he could and said ""brake test!"". All the wheels locked and we slid to a stop, leaving huge tyre marks on the road. The worst part is because my friends a body builder and I'm (clearly) not, he'd lifted the hand brake so far up I literally couldn't move it. Which he found hilarious."
