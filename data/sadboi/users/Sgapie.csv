Last five months I've been studying Psychoanalysis with multiple case studies about trauma (pure coincidence). Another factor is of course 'psilocybine' my choice for hallucinogen to counter the neuroleptics I had to take for a while (not anymore), since the panic like attacks. Now on the verge of a attack I started to think about childhood memories correlated with thoughts I was having. Now sometimes pain is decreasing (I forgot to mention those flare up during the attacks). From my ""toolbox"" I take some psychoanalysis structure and keep probing, trying to follow everything that made the pressure points lighter. I was cleaning doing something simple.

Which are canon. Ramblings aside. What I am more certain about is that injecting mythology to coexist with movie tropes actually put emphasis on more capable use people made of actual mythological derivation's as the likes of Sigmund Freud. To sum up, the derivation of mythology puts emphasis on a schizm in movie trope. There exist a heroes journey of the protagonist and the phenomenological mythological context.

Because it's only in collections, certain editions and one [bundle](https://www.biblio.com/collected-papers-by-freud-sigmund/work/130924); ""Volume 1, page 76-106 (preface, prefix II)"".

The original paper is from 1895's; ""√úber die Berechtigung, von der Neurasthenie einen bestimmten Symptomenkomplex als 'Angstneurose' abzutrennen"" published in ""Neurologisches Zentralblatt"".

It is notable because this exact text, although rare, has become popular canon for both lovers and haters of all things Freudian. And I mean ""canon"" in the most shallow sense of the word, where ""psychoanalysis"" always has sex or sexual connotations. 
The right context for this would be Freuds discovery of it in patients under hypnosis with Hysterical complaints (Hysteria is a subset of Neurosis). The truly important thing to take away from this is the following. It was not that Freud put Hysteria in terms of sexuality what batted the eye, as the Greek root Husterikos (translated ""of the womb"") already suggested of itself. But what offended people was that he, in the article, is of the means to prove that it was also a disease that could affect males. A first in Germany! And so adding insult to injury, male Hysterical symptoms, he made very explicit, where therefore sexually rooted. He explains here five causes for women, four for men and two for both. So your trauma must show itself to be Hysteresis, or another, fear based Neurosis. And then there is also a etiology that is not sexual, although deemed rare by Freud.

Besides Neurosis in ""Beyond the Pleasure Principle"" 1920 he puts them together with childhood attachments and behaviorisms, which I think he at first described in early text as auto-eroticism but here as drives, of which sucking (oral) is one for instance. Promiscuity and masturbation are more often then not, irrelevant. As done by healthy individuals alike any patients. Heck in his letters to Fleischl, Freud even advocated for more promiscuity, in women, men and between classes. As sex is a key ingredient in a adults therapy, in Neurosis anyway, and makes for healthier people. Exactly where the line for Freud is, between trauma inducing sexuality and healthy intercourse, is in the aforementioned 1895 article."
