Sometimes we have light periods, sometimes we have heavy periods, some people have very regular periods and some people have irregular periods. SOMETIMES WE LEAK AND THAT'S OKAY!! People who think it's gross and shame you are not worth your time! Please know your worth and long this guy off ♥️ that goes for everyone reading this and having the same or similar experience. Periods are natural! Don't let anyone make you feel bad about it."

mentalhealth,f3am4q2,t3_dfy4s1,1570779732.0,"I was literally coming here to post about how lame it is! Like all my old friends posting stuff like ""it's okay not to be ok"" like why was it not okay for me though? I swear during this week people only see depression and anxiety as the mental health problems. People who get nervous about stuff suddenly telling the world they have anxiety disorders. Like I appreciate that there is some people actually giving a shit about all this but otherwise mental health is being glamourised, suddenly everyone has depression and anxiety, why would people without these conditions want to have them? It's like no one pretends they have aids during aids week awareness. 
I actually feel alot worse during this week because most people aren't there for you or understanding they just wanna post to look good, like if I actually jumped in their inbox to have a chat about my array of mental health issues they wouldn't know what to say and then I wouldn't hear from them again. It's all bull shit and I can't wait for it to be over."

Aquariums,f2pvp7m,t1_f2pv76p,1570351290.0,"I won't be swayed as I am not a fan of small tanks for fish as I like my fish to be happy and stress free... 
A tank that size also has to house a heater and a filter also."
Aquariums,f2pvcky,t1_f2puy0b,1570351127.0,"It is defo not big enough, why are we saying 'fine' as if the fish had to put up with the bare minimum because op likes the way it looks in a terrarium... Bigger tanks are always better for fish! They need space to swim, not a confined area because it looks pretty for fish keeper..."
Aquariums,f2puh6m,t3_ddu88e,1570350595.0,Why is no one backing the commenters saying this is too small for a Betta?! Poor thing won't last very long in here :( fish are not decorations people!!!
