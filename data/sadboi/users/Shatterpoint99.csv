suboxone,fqx64g2,t1_fqshv2u,1589726652.0,Thank you for the clarification
suboxone,fqeyqbi,t3_fynht9,1589315812.0,"I know this is an old post but it’s exactly the kind of story I’m looking for.

I have been considering Sublocade for quiet awhile. A couple of months ago I decided that I would transition onto the shot, because 
I’m drawn to the subs and take extra when possible.

Personally I really don’t like those highs and lows that you mentioned. That’s the other big reason I thought Subloclade would be a good idea.
The monthly shot would also wipe away my addictive behavior with the subs (taking extra to get rid of the “icky”)

In the end nothing changed.

I’m still on Suboxone

I’m not on Subloclade 

But I wish that I were

The reason I didn’t switch to the shot is because 
I found out that Subloclade is only really an option for people who are taking higher doses of Suboxone. I am on 2mg, and I think you need to be on like 6mg or 8mg for the shot.


I wanted to ask you if the lower dose of Suboxone excludes Subloclade as a viable option?


Can some on 2mg Suboxone switch to Sublocade without basically going up as if you were on 8mg?

Thank you, and be well"

suboxone,fl81luz,t1_fl6r9lr,1584913982.0,I’ve tried a few but not too many. It’s probably time to give a few other’s a shot.
suboxone,fkwbxot,t1_fkulefl,1584588360.0,"Hey thanks for the advice.
It sounds like these meetings are pretty nice actually. You know I think you really struck a chord when you mentioned that meetings will help the way I think. I didn’t really realize it until I read your post but I think maybe I have acceptance problems. Some distress is probably due to being a black sheep and carrying this kinda alone. I think I’m starting to realize why meetings are so important and I think it has to do with community, belonging, & acceptance.

The support here is overwhelmingly awesome.
This really is a great community and I’ve received so much advice and wishes, and honestly it feels like that fucking helps a lot, so I can only imagine meetings being even more beneficial.


So I don’t know what the fuck to do

So here’s what I am doing.
Cutting my dose
Because that’s something that I can do.
The other thing that I know I can do, 
is simply go to the meetings and meet people who I can relate with.
I think you’re absolutely right man

Thanks for hitting me up"
suboxone,fkw8b93,t1_fktgqhz,1584585818.0,"This is a really good reply and your advice is spot on. Especially the slow taper.
I don’t feel ready, and It feels like I just can’t do this. 

So here’s what I have been doing about that: 

Reducing 
because that’s something that I can do and it’s a step in the right direction. I am now slightly below 2mg and I plan to slowly reduce for like 6 months. 


I do have a therapist and he’s awesome. He’s also a drug counselor. He wants me to get off and get better. But I know he’s just seeing the best me I can be, and giving me the healthiest possible advice. He thinks that once I come off it won’t be that bad, but I don’t think he truly understands what it takes to beat this. Or the strength and endurance needed for the 1 or 2 years that follow WD’s. He doesn’t know the struggle, he only knows of it. But it’s people like you, who can relate first hand, who have actually felt the struggle, that helps the most.

And man you’re right about that shame and guilt. I probably do need to be easier on myself.
I’m just starting to realize how common this actually is and your reply reminded me of that.
And that helped me today -it’s my B-day anyhow so you picked a good day to make me feel better lol.

Thank you"
suboxone,fkw5qsh,t3_fkf03i,1584584083.0,"Hey man I really appreciate your comment to my family. And I can see the support in your reply. 
Thank you,  seeing comments like yours actually helps a lot.
I’m almost overwhelmed by the amount of support here, and none of it’s toxic. It’s been very helpful. 
Honestly what I think would help me the most at this time, is talking with people who have been through this or are still in this.
I’ve always heard NA & AA works wonders.
And after my post here I can see why, the support is a major relief. 
I’ve never been to a meeting, but I want you to know that at the least; this community has gotten me to start going to meetings and getting that help.
I’m committed to go asap

I am also worried about the medication supply.
My wife laughed but it’s a very valid concern imo.

Good luck quitting. It sounds like you’re doing well and have a good attitude about it. You can do it

Clonidine works wonders for RLS, relaxation, and sleep. (non narcotic)

Gabapentin is very good at relieving physical and psychological symptoms of WD as well.


You got this"
suboxone,fkw3klh,t1_fktczzb,1584582673.0,"Man you are so right about so many things. I could not agree with you more. It really is all about the behavior.
Suboxone isn’t a withdrawal aid, it’s a treatment medication.

I actually went from a much weaker opiate to Suboxone.
A lot of people think that’s stupid because it creates greater dependency.
But I Needed a rescue.
I Needed something to break that toxic destructive cycle.
I knew that Suboxone would break the cycle and it did.
It also broke my concurrent addiction to stimulants.

And I think that’s what Suboxone is there for, to break destructive behaviors and learn how to cope and live life sober. I think a big reason why it’s as effective as it is is because it doesn’t really create euphoria. 
It allows us time to step back and identify our problem. To see past the distortions and our sickness. and change behavioral patterns or “habits”

I actually don’t blame Suboxone for my depression at all. In fact I think it relieves my depression more than any other medication I have ever taken.

I have Severe Major Depression that is treatment resistant. 
But I didn’t understand it until after getting onto Suboxone and into therapy. Personally I’m very concerned about the depression that will ensue with the withdrawals. Suboxone made me extremely happy for a long time (it was too strong), and I think the generalization is that you have to pay back what you get. I’m worried about PAWS compounding my existing Major Depression to the point of relapse. 

For me; the problem isn’t Subxone. 
It’s my aversion to the suffering of withdrawal and living life without it.

When my mind strays too far, I remind myself of what life was like before. Would have I gotten off my doc? Abso-fucking-lutely! Would I have relapsed?
Definitely. Could I get clean on my own? God I wish
Could I have gotten this far without Suboxone? NO

You’re view on Suboxone I’d say is pretty accurate.
Although I think you may have gotten some wrong impressions about how I see the situation.

I think a lot of people are focused more on the drug rather than the cause/behavioral pattern 

At any rate,the most important thing here is quality of life. 
If someone needs Suboxone for the rest of their life to have that, so be it.
(I’m on Klonopin for life)
If someone needs to try to get off, for a better life. I think that’s great and I wish them the best.
 
But yeah man you really hit a lot of important points that I think a lot of people overlook."
suboxone,fkvw9ax,t1_fkt7w9e,1584578060.0,"Man I’m sorry to hear that. It’s hard,

A lot of what you’re experiencing Could be anxiety based. If you feel like it could help, it may be a good idea to start taking a medication that treats anxiety. Antidepressants are used for this, (despite the name). They do take some time to start working. There’s a medication called Gabapentin, which helps lots of people with anxiety and possibly mood. One nice thing about this medication is that it starts working immediately.
The Gabapentin could give you some immediate relief while waiting for the antidepressant to kick in. 

But the very first thing that I would do is cut your Suboxone dose down. You’re on too much imo and I’m certain most would agree.
You can drop from 8mg to 4mg right away, and you will not have any withdrawal symptoms at all.
Definitely.

Look I’m in a dark place too.
Just like yourself, I’ve considered a locked facility so I will not hurt myself.  
I am completely terrified as well 
And I don’t know what the fuck to do either.
I have no idea how the hell I’m going to get off or what to do. 


So here’s what I’ve been doing about that.


*Reducing 


because it’s what I can do.


I’ve Slowly been reducing. Just taking less.
And I do not put myself through any withdrawal while doing this. 


Take less. No withdrawal 


This is what you can start doing for yourself now.
Later, there are a number of things that make withdrawal easier.


TL;DR
I would talk to a doctor - absolutely.
I’d ask about antidepressants to treat anxiety.
I’d ask about Gabapentin for anxiety
I would consider seeing a therapist. 
I would start taking 4mg daily starting tomorrow,
then stay there for a month or two.




I really hope you find your way out of the dark.
You can message me Anytime."
suboxone,fkvr45p,t1_fkt6bec,1584574968.0,"Tomorrow I will tell you my story.
been really busy reading through all of the replies here, there’s a ton.
It’s not one of those really intense experiences that some have gone through.
It’s more about mishandling’s, mistakes and how messed up the system is."
suboxone,fkvqoc9,t1_fkt5x24,1584574710.0,"Gabapentin really does work wonders for opiate withdrawal. Physically and psychologically imo.
Unfortunately I’ve been taking it for the past few years so I don’t think it’s going to help me as much as it has before (tolerance).
My plan has been to stop this medication a couple months before WD and then start taking it again when I do start WD, so that it’s a more effective aid.

Clonidine is even better imo. It’s a blood pressure medication that helps so much with the RLS and general comfort. It’s kind of like a non narcotic  Benzo imo.

Klonopin I’ve been taking for 6-7 years. I’ve never had an issue with it and it is has made my life better. I know it doesn’t work like that for everyone, but it worked out well for me.
It has helped tremendously during past WD’s but the medication doesn’t bring that level of relief anymore because I’ve been on it for so long. 
It will still help me during WD but it’s not the smoking gun like it would be for most of you.

Remeron my wife has a prescription for. I’ll definitely utilize that.

The thing that gets me is that so many healthcare professionals want to give you Benadryl as an aid. Fucking antihistamines man, they make the RLS twice as bad. It exacerbates symptoms for many many people.  


I’m actually really glad to hear that Gabapentin helped so much for your WD’s.
I’ve never withdrawn from Subs, so I don’t know what to expect and I’ve been wondering if Gabapentin would even touch it.


Hey thanks for your advice"
suboxone,fkvo4io,t1_fkt4prg,1584573197.0,"That’s great that you have recovered! That’s awesome.

Yeah I’ve learned through experience that you cannot beat this until You are ready. 
Unfortunately I don’t think this is something that healthy people really understand.

I guarantee I’ll fold.
Not because I want to.
But I can tell based on how I feel, how I think, and past and current behaviors. 
I were to say otherwise, I just wouldn’t be being honest with myself. 

Your advice is rock solid.
I’m slowly tapering over a period of months.
I got down to 2mg strips, and just cut to 1.5mg (3/4) a few days ago. Now I’m going to get much more delicate.

Thank you for your reply and your advice"
suboxone,fkvma3o,t1_fksx2l6,1584572117.0,"Yes I am. Unfortunately they don’t work.

I take Wellbutrin which helps in other ways.
And I take Fluvoxamine which does seem to help my OCD.

I’ve met people who beat depression just by making a doctors appointment. All they have to do is take a pill. I wish I were one of them so badly. My depression seems to be treatment resistant. I’m starting to think that it’s product of childhood trauma, and if that’s the case, I believe that means that there’s no chemical imbalance in my brain (unless 2 sources of depression are compounding each other). I suppose this would explain why meds don’t work for me.

It honestly feels like the Suboxone is doing my
antidepressants job, relieving depression better than any of my antidepressants."

I’m sorry you had to go through all of that pain, I can understand your worry about going back, that sounds like real suffering.

There’s two reasons I don’t want to come off yet.
1) I don’t want to go back to before.
2) The depression that you speak of.

The depression that this stuff causes with reduction is unreal. And I have the exact same problem.

Good luck to you, I hope everything works out"
suboxone,fkv6kk5,t1_fkspo78,1584563114.0,"See that’s exactly what I wanted to do.

I’ve lived with terrible depression & anxiety forever. I take Benzo’s to kill the anxiety. It works and I’ve never had an issue with them (6+ years).

And the Suboxone works for my depression almost as well as the Benzo’s. But I do have a problem with the Subs. I self medicate with them, as in I adjust the dose if I want, and when I want.

For me personally, the Suboxone was stronger than my original doc. So it basically got me a bit “high” for like 1.5 years. That is gone now that I’m completely tolerant. Personally I believe that my current struggle with depression is due to 
2 primary factors:

1)  me having to live without that “high” or euphoria for the first time in 5 years as I am adjusting to that “sober” life. I’ve been on Subs for 3 years but only been “clean” (debatable) for like 4 months.

2) I feel like I’m running out of time. 
Immense dread and despair and loss of hope. Because I think I’m being pushed off Subs this summer.

But yeah Suboxone does seem to work well for my baseline depression. I don’t abuse the medication much anymore because I’m not really chasing the dragon anymore. My hope is that I’ll learn to not abuse it at all so I can stay on it for maintenance and depression.

I don’t see anything wrong with it being another medication that incidentally helps depression
either."
suboxone,fksqluv,t1_fksk2dn,1584496118.0,"Admittedly I am a chronic ruminator. 
Yeah I don’t take your words offensively at all. 
In fact It just sounds like you recognize the exact same dilemma that I do. I’m just not ready, but my wife has been pushing hard for me to quit this summer (was my initial plan). And honestly, that just makes all that shit, worse. It’s pressure and I feel like I’m running out of time. Because you’re absolutely right imho, I fully agree with you.
I need more time to heal psychologically before I’m strong enough to tackle this immense beast.

I used to be strong.

I used to be relentless.

I used to have a really positive attitude in life.

I’ve slowly been getting these things back through therapy. But damn has it been going slow. I need to get my ass to some NA meetings. I’ve never even been to one ever. But I imagine they would help me heal faster. 

Thank you for your feedback, be well"
suboxone,fksph93,t1_fksjmk7,1584495377.0,"Hey thanks for the kind words. A little bit of positivity can go a long way. Yeah I’ve been slowly reducing. The aim of the game is to micro taper. I don’t want to jump at 2mg.
I have a combination safe, I don’t know the code and the backup keys have been given to my father in case of emergency. I can’t manipulate my dad even if I tried. Although I can and have manipulated the safe. I’m able to extract strips if I want it bad enough. So it turns out the safe isn’t perfect but man is it a tremendous wall, it helps a lot. My wife is a nurse and she administers my daily dose. I just cut down to 1.5mg (3/4 strip).

You know opiate addiction is hard as hell.
And it’s always only bad things that you hear about it, I can’t think of any real positives about being an opiate addict. It’s a very negative thing.

Thank you for your feedback

Good luck with your transition off.
I hope everything works out well for you.
You have a great attitude & mentality about it, and that should help tremendously. Just don’t lose sight of it, stay positive. You got this!

Btw 
Clonodine is a really good WD aid (you probably already know this and I’m guessing that you’re prescribed it)


But Gabapentin really helps a lot too, and a lot of people don’t know this. It helps with the physical symptoms (aids RLS) and the psychological symptoms as well. It’s not a lifesaver but it really does take some edge off. You probably won’t feel it, but you will ‘notice’ it.

And of course a bit of smoke can help sleep issues, if that’s your thing.

And some Benzo’s could be your best friend here (or your worst enemy). If you use them plz be careful.
Klonopin lasts nearly twice as long as Xanax.

It’s actually very common, even when we’re not in full blown WD or “real” WD. I definitely can relate, I have experienced both many many times.

I did have Single Combat in this deck but eventually I had to pull it because of the word “sacrifice” in it’s rules text. I don’t quite remember how it affected this decks game play specifically but it made it unusable with its mechanics and strategy somehow."

I haven’t piloted it yet, but I just finished building K’rrik. I went with the Lifegain theme, tossed in a few life-swapping effects and a suite of oppressive creatures.
If you get the chance maybe you could send your list my way, I’d love to see what’s working for you.
Thanks"
Documentaries,fdc9zuj,t1_fdbwhf2,1578270045.0,"This is ridiculous. Your ‘answer’ to solving depression is just uneducated jargon. Very naive.
Basically your advice to stop depression is;

a) Focus and identify what you don’t like about yourself. 

b) then change what you identified.

The question here is How to change.
The answer isn’t “then change”

You also seem to be promoting not taking medications and to blame depression on oneself, which is terrible advice.

I’m sorry, but your advice is anti-advice.
Toxic, potentially destructive, and part of the problem."
EDH,fcp0bsc,t1_fcoml6p,1577846593.0,"Thank you for the feedback! 
It’s nice that this community exists because it’s a really helpful resource.

Yeah one thing I’ve noticed while building Slivers is that it looks like it would be ridiculously easy to just swap through Commanders and still have a finished deck. 
None of my other decks are like that at all.

With that being said I’m basically going to follow your footsteps and put Overlord at the helm.
Hivelord in the 99. And play test First Sliver here and there for fun and variety."
EDH,fbydwkj,t3_ef33t7,1577214450.0,"I haven’t read all the comments so I don’t know if I’m reiterating here but I would suggest trying Voltron or a deck that wins by Commander damage.

I have a lot of decks, Tribal, Lifegain, Maze’s End, 


Enchantement matters Voltron 


Artifact matters Voltron


Zur (wins by cmdr damage)


Hidden Commander - Big Fattie Monster 


etc.

out of all of the themes that I play. Voltron is the most flexible with a lot of different directions to go in."
EDH,fawwjz0,t3_eaq8dt,1576376121.0,"Just like yourself, I don’t get to play nearly as often as I’d like, but I do spend a lot of time researching and building decks.

As others have mentioned, 36-37 lands should be your target.
31-32 is definitely not enough, you absolutely need more.

Most of my decks run 36 lands and 8-12 ramp effects (accelerants).
I used to run a lot less ramp, like 6 or 7. But as I’ve grown as a player I’ve learned how powerful a healthy amount of ramp is. 

Try 36-37 lands and 8-10 ramp
This will seem hard at first as it will cut into the number of ‘fun’ cards that you can play. But your decks will be a lot better and you will be a better builder. It will also make cutting cards more challenging, which can actually make building more enjoyably imo."
EDH,faarspf,t1_fa9m1hb,1575912698.0,"Yup that’s almost exactly what I’ve been doing
Pulled: Silent Arbiter / Crawlspace / Norn’s Annex / The Immortal Sun 

Added: Swan Song / Mana Leak / Disallow / Dovin’s Veto

I may move Zur’s entire suite of Pillowfort cards over to a more casual deck of mine that would make good use out of the effect"
EDH,fa902xy,t1_fa8uixu,1575858971.0,My list is outdated but I started running that card awhile ago. It’s a great card
EDH,fa8y3va,t1_fa8tjk4,1575857554.0,"Yeah that’s how I’m starting to see it too.
I never used counter spells much before and was really into pillowfort, especially with Esper decks.
But now that I’ve grown a bit as a player, I’m starting to see how powerful these counter spells can be, especially when you run a suite of them.
But yeah absolutely, Pillowfort is definitely fun, so I’m thinking about just moving my Zur Pillowfort suite over to my [[Alela, Artful Provocateur]] deck that I’m brewing up. That deck is a lot more casual anyhow while Zur is a lot more about power.
If I do that, I think my Zur deck will become stronger, and it would also push my Alela deck further towards completion.
Thank you for the feedback"

The content matter is exactly the same.
- ‘don’t know what to brew’
- ‘looking for suggestions’

I’m actually going to try The First Sliver first and just keep Hivelord in the 99, and possibly swap them later. But yeah it sounds like First Sliver is pretty great.
If you please, I have a question for you;

I’ve seen a number of Sliver lists running the card [[Training Grounds]], and I just don’t know why. 
What does Training Grounds do for these decks?
I have an unused copy, is this something that I should be running?

Thanks for your time"

I may very well go this route, and I really like what you’re saying. Sounds pretty awesome actually.

Anyway, great suggestion. Thanks"

With all of this excessive free time at home. One thing I like to do is strategically build Magic decks. Because I enjoy it.

You asked. And that’s why.

My playgroup is really cool too, so if you miss something with a new deck, they’ll often point it out :)"

suboxone,f7u0ctg,t1_f7qgxz5,1574009352.0,"Hey I really appreciate the reply.
It’s nice to be able to speak to people such as yourself, who have gone through this before.

You know I’ve been addicted to a few things over these past 5 years, transferred addictions multiple times, and I always ask myself that same question. 
‘If slow tapering affects the strength and/or the duration of PAWS?’
I agree with you. I mean tapering helps the acutes for a reason, I don’t think the post-acutes would be any exception. And my past experience with Stimulate addiction has led me to believe that tapers defiantly have an impact on PAWS."

Thank you!"
EDH,f7mainx,t1_f7lx88r,1573858157.0,"Awesome! So it sounds like that going wide w/ tokens strategy works just fine and holds up at a table.

Yeah I was casually looking through your decklist and while I do see what you mean about later upgrades, it’s actually a really nice list.

It has a lot of things that I’ve been wanting to include in my own build.
Your decklist will actually be a really good reference for myself.
I’m going to take a closer look at it as I continue to build, in fact I think your build will be my primary resource actually. Since were both looking to do the same thing anyhow. And you’ve already done it, played it, tested it, even won with it. 

That’s awesome man, I’m really glad to hear that it works well."
EDH,f7ls61b,t1_f7joqow,1573847115.0,"I haven’t checked out your list quite yet, I will though definitely.
But first I wanted to ask you something.
You said your main focus has been gettin a bunch  of pumped tokens.


So is your deck basically built to spawn as many tokens as possible, (go wide) and then just buff them up??

That’s how I’ve been thinking about building her, and if your deck works that way; it’ll give me more confidence that I’m building her a good way.

Is that what you built your deck like?"
EDH,f7jdt37,t1_f7jc7d0,1573775516.0,"Yes I agree, she does so many things.
At first I was thinking  about going Voltron with her, I think she’d make a really cool Voltron Commander being in Esper colors.
But I already have a Voltron Artifacts Matters (equipment) and a Voltron Enchantment Matters  and I also play Zur, who wins using Commander damage and kinda feels like a Voltron as well.
So I think I’m going to build this Alela  deck as a Token going-Wide strategy."

Instill Energy I had as part of my [[Uril the Mistalker]] deck but it was pretty misplaced there anyhow, so I just swapped it out. I totally missed that one even though both decks are the exact same colors.
