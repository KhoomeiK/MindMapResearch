I'm generally into learning to make healthier choices for myself and it seems to irk her so much. She is always trying to give me food because she doesn't think I eat anything at all, lol. 

And I never thought of that but google would be my parent too. I always had the strange thing where whenever I had a question about something, my mother could rarely ever give me an answer. All the time while growing up and not knowing about something new that I had to deal with or really just any question ever almost, lol.

And for years she would always mention that I should go to a trade school of some sort. Nothing wrong with trade schools but I felt like she thought very little of them. When I was trying to figure out how to get into college, she didn't help until my younger brother graduated from high school and going to college. He is definitely the golden child and college material whereas I wasn't. Nevermind that I have two degrees now. And for years my mother would always bring up how I should get a job at Walmart.

socialskills,fon8ua8,t3_g85shi,1587914709.0,"I used to have this problem when I was younger and it's taken me a good while to learn how to navigate that. I'm probably still bad at it in instances but I realized that it's best to do something about it in the moment if you can because it's worse to dwell on it for freaking years! 

And I love to just say ""no"" now. You can just say no to someone and it can be just a dead stop to whatever crap but also and even more important is realizing that a lot of times, just a tiny bit of push back against someone or something is really all that you need. And a lot of times you don't even have to just say no but just don't waste any time or energy on that person or do whatever they wanted and they get that you are basically saying no to them. 

Also a lot of people hate conflict and I can see that just as well with people who seem to create it with people that do pick up on noticing what people they see as possible pushovers and will try to treat you that way. One, it shocks them almost when you do stick up for yourself because they had you all wrong with whatever crap they could do and some people are always trying to push things here or there and they realize that they calculated the situation all wrong. Don't blow up at them or let it show that they got to you but just say no or laugh at them or even better, just disagree with them, in any way. Lean into it, just that feeling of leaning into it rather than avoid also gives you a lot more confidence in whatever the situation is.

And on another point about how not many like conflict, even if someone was wanting to actually fight, if you fight back in even just a little bit it will usually stop them from picking on you. They could totally still beat the shit out of you but just that you fought back says to them that the next time that they try to do that, you will fight back, maybe they just happened to get lucky that time and won, or maybe you even learned to fight back even better than last time, or just create a bit of a grey area in which that creates a bit of uncertainty for them that they might not win. Also, with reading the situation, if they tried to do it again, maybe you would be even way more pissed and go full mental on them because you are totally fucking sick of it and beat the crap out of them. They don't know and if you push back even just a little, they will move on to someone else if it's that kind of situation.

And there were times when I pushed back in just very tiny ways actually and I felt weak at the time but it still weirdly worked. Because people hate conflict. Once when I was in high school I had this kid who always seemed to dislike me in junior high but I barely knew them and in high school, in the hallway they would always walk by me and just very slightly push up against me if it was crowded. It was strange the first time it happened. They did it a second time probably a week later, maybe even a the third until I just slightly pushed back and they totally stopped from that point on. 

Another time in high school I was standing somewhere by myself and a group of people were next to me, they were always there and one kid kept looking at me. Like he was noticing something about me and kept looking for some reason so I just asked what they were looking at. It felt very defensive and weak of me and the way I asked but maybe to them it came out kind of cold but they said nothing and stopped looking. Then the next day he wasn't even there with his group of friends even though he always was before and his friends were even asking each other was but I don't remember him being there ever again."

Too many people don't care that people might die.

I would think more people would care since so many are losing their hours at work and some their jobs but people are still downplaying it.

Too many people are making up their own facts about this. They seem to be changing it over time but still downplaying it as much as they can. People are told to do a variety of things they need to be doing to not get the virus or to spread it and instead they are choosing to do the one that  takes the least amount of effort. They still want to go to all the places they enjoy going to, they don't want to try to socially distancing themselves from others, but they will wash their hands once in a while.
