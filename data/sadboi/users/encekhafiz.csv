I don't know what else to do. I cared because no one else would. It's like you don't have anything more to lose, but doing anything won't make you gain anything either. Maybe at this point I'm just caring out of self pity. I wish to be taken away so many times and got so disappointed to still be alive the next day, went as far as taking care of myself out of pity.

I'm beginning to accept the fact that I'm the only person that can't help bring myself up.

I'm definitely writing CBT on my checklist. I heard good things about it, especially people with BPD. I feel like I'm more close to that, but I can't know for sure.

I feel the same. I rather bottle it up than see anyone else hurting like I do. It's been a tough 7 years. I tell myself, I need to hang on for another day.

I honestly loved BJ's ending, as frustratingly true it is. Because it's too real, unlike Horsin' Around. I just.. idk, I pity him so much that my heart breaks when even Diane cut him off in the end, but this is for the best.

I don't feel any gaping hole after finishing BJH. But damn, I can't be any more satisfied & disappointed with the end. Countless times during the watch I asked myself, ""is Raphael okay? This is too real. How can you even make it this.. real?""

As for my personal opinion what happened next, I like to believe he found his solace with Mr Peanutbutter, they make another TV Show (expect the grumpy BJ having to work 2nd string with PB) but after everything, it all turns out okay and he can finally rest assured he won't fuck things up again. :)"

depression,fej51r1,t1_fej4v3s,1579157188.0,"That's the spirit! I'm also constantly dreading for that stump whenever I felt terrific. Most of the time it's true, mainly due to our mindset.

But as long as the rollercoaster's up top, let's enjoy it lol

P/s: feeling good now although lacking in sleep/eat. Usually felt good hours/days before that fucking bad episode (as I like to call it) hits me again but I'll be fine, I guess"
depression,fej4rw4,t1_fej4j5w,1579156888.0,"It's gonna hurt when you hit your low mate. Just know that it's totally fine to feel like that. At least that's what I told myself every fking day. ""It's going to get better tomorrow"" is the only hope I'm holding on."
depression,fei5scm,t1_fei5gu5,1579130908.0,"Welp that's me sometimes. But y'know there are times where u need to pick your shit simply because nobody else would, and you're feeling shit the whole day, and that's when you REALLY felt like wanting to.. i don't know, sit a while :/"
depression,fei5h9q,t1_fei4un9,1579130714.0,"And the worst part is that you're mentally tired, much less physically. And there you are lying for hours, unable to sleep drifting into who the fuck knows zone scared to sleep because dreams can be mean. 

Oh but tomorrow's gonna be a great day to do anything.. before feeling burnt out again lol"
heartbreak,f1m9j6x,t3_d9x9yl,1569588417.0,So sorry to hear that. Stay strong.
BreakUps,f1m84zs,t1_f1m7tl9,1569587280.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not generalising all kind of breakups though. 

There's things that we can control, and there's things beyond our control. If he wanted to stay, he'll stay no matter how hard. I learnt that the hard way.

If only exes give us an insight on how miserable we would be post breakup (and we actually felt a slap to change, I'm believing that the relationship can still be saved - given if both sides still want to continue putting efforts)"
BreakUps,f1hox8v,t1_f1hnwsk,1569498131.0,"Im a firm believer in that theory of 'there is always a chance to reconcile' if a relationship ended due to other than a cheating partner. 

And it is what it is. If roles were reversed, im pretty sure almost everyone (dumpee) wouldnt be able to communicate better too. 

We're only human who wanted nothing other than self happiness. And by getting rid of him/her, it would definitely help dumpers feel happy. I hate that mindset, but it is what it is.

Stay strong mate. Keep moving forward!"
