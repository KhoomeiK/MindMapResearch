It's our responsibility to function as well as possible, despite our illness. If you're not able to, adjust your meds, use a coping mechanism. But we can't expect to be catered to.

We were high school sweethearts. He was a senior and I was a freshman. He was a jock, i was the emo kid. We took each other's virginity. We were perfect, happy. Until he left for college a state away. We were young and immature and couldn't handle the distance so we broke it off. We both quickly found someone new and just continued on with our lives. He got married, joined the military, had two kids. I was with a guy I met in high school and went to college with, I was working my ass off, making bomb money with two jobs... but I wasn't happy. The guy I was with never talked about marriage or kids which i wanted both. But I partied heavily and ignored my feelings. One day, out of the blue, first love's  wife contacted me. She went on and on about their perfect little life and suggested I talk to first love and try to be friends. So we started talking, and I discovered he wasn't happy. After months of texting (nothing emotional, just chit chat) he admitted that he never stopped loving me and had just given the new girl everything he wished he could have given me. My heart sank. I realized that deep down, I had never let go of him. We agreed to stop talking then. He was married. He had kids. Fast forward a month or so, he called me. His wife had gone off the deep end. He found out that while he was at work she was neglecting the young kids. She had also thrown a beer on his fellow soldier after he made a light hearted joke. They got in a fight and she admitted she hated being a wife and mother, especially in the military which hurt him because he had only joined the army to provide for her. They had decided to end it. He was distressed because not only was she leaving but she decided she just didnt want her kids anymore and was leaving them with him. He loved his kids but had no babysitter or daycare set up. He ended up having to send them to his parents for awhile. At this point I started reflecting on my life as it was, and realized how unhappy I was. I realized I had no real future with my boyfriend. I knew in my heart what I wanted. I ended up moving across two states to be with him. I'll admit I was a bit manic, but my thought at the time was that he needed me and those kids needed a mom. I changed everything and became a stay at home mom and housewife instantly. And I had never felt such purpose. He and I were perfect together again. Still together seven years later and we have a kid of our own too. Our relationship is effortless really. We get along. We both have the deep feeling that we belong together and life just works as long as we're together. We've been through a lot, but our relationship, our love, is consistent. Life is hard but our love is good. Our friendship is good. And we have a great little family."
