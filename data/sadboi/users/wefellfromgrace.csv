makeuptips,fn2ktvg,t3_fyqjr3,1586592737.0,"Straight lashes Asian girl here. What helps hold a curl is an appropriate eyelash curler and waterproof mascara. 

Invest in a wide curler like [Shu Uemura](https://www.amazon.com/Shu-Uemura-4935421350853-uemura-Eyelash/dp/B000VSG1PO/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2REAFUNTBNQ86&dchild=1&keywords=shu+uemura+eyelash+curler&qid=1586592554&sprefix=shu+uem%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-2) or [Shiseido](https://www.amazon.com/Shiseido-Eyelash-Curler-Original-Version/dp/B004RS7RRA/ref=sr_1_2?crid=N736D124EDCG&dchild=1&keywords=shiseido+eyelash+curler&qid=1586592589&sprefix=shiseido+eyelash+curler%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-2) to better fit the eye shape and curl lashes more effectively. Curl lashes in an interval (press, hold a few seconds, release, repeat). You can curl the lashes at angles too (i.e. curl at the base of the lashes, release, curl up the lash, etc) to create a more natural curled look.

Waterproof mascaras are also better for holding curls. I use [Maybelline The Falsies Push Up Drama Waterproof Mascara](https://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-New-York-Falsies-Waterproof/dp/B0126RYA3M/ref=sr_1_15?crid=BXFF0LF7PLAV&dchild=1&keywords=maybelline+falsies+waterproof+mascara&qid=1586592461&sprefix=maybelline+waterproof%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-15) and wiggle the wand between my eyelashes when applying. The bristles are really thin which I think helps to prevent clumps. You can also use an eyelash comb while the mascara is wet to separate the lashes."
