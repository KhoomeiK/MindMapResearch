Anxiety,fr6hvwy,t3_fj2y1a,1589926558.0,"On a personal note, I went back into my office for a briefing about our new operating procedures and safety protocols for half a day, and I thought it would be really weird to be back around my co-workers, but it was so nice to see everyone in person and it felt like a small step back to normalcy. I'm really looking forward to being back full time with all our new protocols in place next week.

If anyone is having doubts about going back to an office. The first step is the hardest and being able to interact with people in person was such a boost to my mood, and hopefully for the rest of you who will be returning to in-person in the near future."

Anxiety,fqr9a7t,t3_fj2y1a,1589579989.0,"Some great news coming out of the Alberta press conference today:

- Outdoor gathering limits have been increased from 15 to 50 with distancing between members of different households.
- 58 new cases province-wide on ~4500 tests (1.2% positive)
- Playgrounds can open.
- If we keep infections low during Phase 1 of this re-launch the quicker we can get to Phase 2.
- Press conferences will now only be every second day during the weekdays (after the long weekend). I'm hoping that Dr. Hinshaw gets a much needed break, she's been awesome for Alberta through the whole pandemic."
Anxiety,fqkhqel,t3_fj2y1a,1589427559.0,"Hello beautiful people of this thread. Just a heads up the media will likely be running with a lot of doom articles tomorrow as the deaths will unfortunately hit the milestone of 300K in the next few hours.

However, I would like everyone in this thread to remember that we celebrated 1 million recoveries less than two weeks ago, and recoveries are exponentially growing (almost 1.7 million as of right now and increasing all the time). Also, we are still waiting on a few big countries and states to post their recovery numbers, so those who are beating this virus keep growing and growing.

Keep your heads up when the media will likely try and feed the negativity narrative tomorrow, when there are more people every day beating this thing."

What’s given me major comfort in this is that we have the best scientific minds working on a treatment or vaccine and it will be found soon, or this virus will mutate to mimic other common cold coronaviruses over time.

Also, the human immune system is an amazing thing and everything is so focused on the gravest outlook when we’ve seen almost 1.5 million people of all ages recover from COVID (and this is only confirmed cases and not those who are not lab confirmed and simply brush it off as nothing). I also don’t focus on all the talk of the “new normal” people will go back to concerts, sporting events, crowded spaces, and theme parks and will continue to live their lives like they were just like humanity has after every pandemic before.
