AskReddit,fk6a8rl,t3_fghdvd,1583897062.0,When I was in high school I had a shitty mall food court job. I met a girl on my first day & she was very nice & we became friends. After a couple weeks she started getting really strange. She told me she was sleeping with our 30 year old engaged manager when she was 17 (in hindsight she was probably fucking with me) & shed get mad at me for interacting with this manager because I was trying to ‚Äústeal her man.‚Äù shortly after that she started locking me out of the kitchen every time I went to use the bathroom or go on break. The final straw was when we were both at the counter making sandwiches for a long line of customers & I had to open the mini fridge below the counter to get more lettuce. Because it was a tight space the door brushed against her legs & she got right in my face & started  screaming in front of the customers that I kicked her. I got right back in hers & told her I was sick of her shit & quit mid shift leaving her with a line of 10 or so people
