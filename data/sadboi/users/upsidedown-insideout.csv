Just know that you might have the worst urgency you've ever had in your life and no sleep will happen.

I've had them for weeks at a time when my bladder has a shut down and not allowed me to pee. For me a catheter feels like having a knife shoved  up my urethra and aggravates my bladder so badly I want to die.

The only time I ever slept with a catheter is when I literally passed out from exhaustion. 

They also have to move your bladder around with a csection which can make things infinitely worse. I know when I was pregnant I was told to avoid a csection unless absolutely necessary because of that.

People always talked a lot of bullshit to me when when I was pregnant or wanting to be, so.im just trying to be honest. Like my urologist at the time even said I should get pregnant since my case is severe and there's a good chance it could make me better for the foreseeable future. Uh, no, it made me so much worse. I already couldn't work and  barely take care of myself, now I have a toddler. Honestly, I don't take care of myself at all anymore because I just physically and mentally cant so both.

I've got both bowel and bladder issues, the bladder disease makes leaving home pretty much impossible. It's like a raging UTI but worse. I need access to a bathroom 24/7, and lately the symptoms have been so bad I can't walk much. Standing makes the urgency overhelming and each step makes it worse. All public bathrooms are closed, but because all my issues I wouldn't feel safe using them right now anyway.

I also can't buy something nice for myself. I have no money. I haven't bought anything for myself in years. My mom bought me maternity clothes when I had my son. I genuinely hate asking my husband for money then having to explain what I need and why I need it. In a way though, it's been good since it's taught me 99% of things I don't need lol. I'll be honest, my headphones broke. I used to listen to a lot of music, kinda like an escape. So I've been eyeing some on Amazon.

I also have alopecia from malnutrition (from health issues). It is something I am VERY self conscious about. I want a wig sooooo badly. My mom took me to a place to get one right before covid-19 but they were outrageously expensive. Like over a grand. I didn't end up getting one.

Honestly, at this point I don't even know how to take care of myself. I'm so busy trying to just survive the day. I have multiple breakdowns most days since taking care of my toddler is so fucking hard with my health issues. All I want to do is sleep for a month and do literally nothing for a week.

There's weeks where I don't even shower because I just can't while I'm taking care of my son. Then once my husband is home and we've got everything done, kid in bed, I'm too exhausted and in too much pain to stand any longer. So I just go to bed, or sit on the couch for half and hour on my phone, then bed.

And no, they don't have to accomodate you. Technically they do, but you will 100% be laid off for other reasons if you can't do your job. If they think someone can do the job better than you, you're gone.

My husband works retail and he says there is no way I'd physically be able to do anything on the floor or in office. Even excluding that, he says with the amount of time I spend in the bathroom I'd be let go way before the 90 day probation ended (the time where the employer can let you go for any reason if they think you aren't a good fit). 

I used to work health care and honestly, it was bad. I was in so much pain while doing my job I was straight up bawling in front of the people I was trying to change/bathroom/feed etc. Like inconsolably. I'd have to leave them in not particularly safe circumstances because I needed the bathroom constantly where I'd spend upwards of 20 minutes just trying to get out an agonizing trickle of pee. 

I live in BC. There are no GPs to switch to. My husbands retired when he was still a kid. He hasn't been able to find one taking patients since. I'm technically lucky to have to one I do since a lot don't have one at all.

I can't take antidepressants. It makes my bladder issues a thousand time worse to the point I'm bedridden and unable to function. I've tried about 7.

I've seen a psychiatrist at the hospital and because I'm unable to take meds they said they can't help me and to seek therapy which, as I said, I can't afford.

There were some pregnancy complications that thankfully got better. But there was a lot of stress. Also losing my job made it so I didn't qualify for maternity leave. Which really fucked us. 

My health got even worse lol. And he just kinda disappeared. I hold a lot of resentment for my husband willingly leaving me during labor and not caring about missing the birth. He just genuinely doesn't care. He doesn't care how terribly I was treated and he doesn't care how badly I spiralled afterwards.

When I ask why he says he doesn't have a reason, he just doesn't care. I told him I need to feel protected but he says he doesn't feel protective and never will be. I said I need to feel loved, but he does say he loves me.

When I tell him I need to FEEL loved he gets frustrated and tells me he's too tired and if I want him to be nicer, show affection then I need to more cleaning and keep the place nicer looking, which let me tell you is really fucking hard with a toddler. But even when I do he doesn't notice at all.

I've been complementing him a lot late lately since I know he's feeling insecure about losing all his muscle tone (he used to work out and run constantly but hasn't had much time since our son was born).

BabyBumpsCanada,fmfaheq,t1_fmf7syw,1586023190.0,"Oh, I did FINALLY find free counselling that offered 10 sessions. I got two before they closed indefinitely because of the pandemic. I don't have an income (can't work because of health issues) so free is my only option. 

I've told my husband I feel betrayed. Like beyond betrayed and that I should feel protected by him, but don't at all to the extent I feel like he doesn't give a shit about me. He says cares but he'd never get angry or advocate on my behalf because that's not who he is. 

He'd genuinely be perfect if he didn't make me feel worthless. He does a lot around the home, etc. Makes dinner. But at the end of the day I feel like a could drop dead and he wouldn't give a damn. I feel like someone could rape me and beat me to a pulp and he'd shrug his shoulders and never think twice about it."
BabyBumpsCanada,fmf75rv,t1_fmf3biu,1586021291.0,"I can 100% guarantee you'd have just been kicked out of the hospital. I've had many surgeries/hospital stays there and have worked with vulnerable folks (worked with high needs people that were too complicated for nurses to take care of) during their hospital stays. The amount of shits nurses don't give is terrifying.

One of the times after I had surgery I was begging for about a week for a doctor for an agonizing bladder issue (unrelated to the surgery, but still in desperate need of a doctor). Nurses were convinced I was faking. So I didn't get help until my mom asked my aunt who is a retired nurse and knew one of the nurses on my floor to come in and talk to her. So my aunt basically told her I NEED help and wasn't faking.  She got me a doctor. I needed immediate surgery and was diagnosed with a debilitating and incurable bladder disease. Yet, not so much as an apology for nurses berating me for a week telling me it's in my head or I'm faking. That's also after they overdosed me and nearly killed me the first day there. Student nurse found me unresponsive and I had to get one of those shots, can't remember what it was called. Basically to clear the meds from my system.

Don't even get me started on the horrific shit they do to people that can't speak or advocate for themselves. People like to hype nurses up. But honestly, I've met maybe 2 good ones in the 10 years I've been sick and the three or so I worked in health care. 

I've overheard nurses mocking patients that were in pain. Seen a little old lady left on the floor after she fell out of bed. The nurse just closed the door so she didn't have to listen to her scream. She died less than a week later. With my person they kept trying to give them the wrong meds. Tried to pull their stent right out because they thought it was a hair. Kept doing things that would make them aspirate and puke everywhere since they didn't want to do it the harder way which would prevent that.

I've literally seen an elderly person being shockingly abused while roughly given an enema. Door wide open for anyone to see. I obviously reported that. Nurse got two weeks off and came right back and treated the patients the same.

The system, at least here, is a joke.

If you are belligerent or upset at all they will take you 100% less seriously and won't help you at all. You basically have to kiss their ass the whole time and even still you probably won't get help."
BabyBumpsCanada,fmdthrf,t1_fmdodd0,1585977435.0,"We had our bags packed. I had everything I needed there, just not my husband. The only reason he wasn't allowed there was because it was past visiting hours and I had a room mate.

My husband is also basically a doormat (learned this the hard way) and he'd never fight for me anyways because that would be too awkward and god forbid he embarrass himself. I'm pretty sure some random person could walk by us on the street and punch me directly in face and he'd act like it didn't happen. 

He doesn't care that he missed the birth since he can't change it. Doesn't care about the trauma since he can't change it. Doesn't care that it was a fucking nightmare for me and has fucked me up beyond belief, because, yeah, he can't change it. If he can't change something, it's not worth thinking about it and basically doesn't exist.

I desperately wanted him to complain and help me out with that kind of stuff, but no. He doesn't want to make things weird or uncomfortable for others, plus it's not a big deal since we're all fine. I mean, I'm not fine. I'm pretty sure I've lost my mind, but like, I don't count. That's not something he can change, so it's not worth thinking about. I've only begged him for help over and over in tears absolutely distraught saying i NEED help, like mental help, but that would require time and effort and calling people and stuff, which might be awkward, so lets just not think about it."
BabyBumpsCanada,fmdl6yt,t1_fmdk2be,1585970690.0,"It's Canada, medical malpractice pretty much isn't even a thing. It happened 14 months ago. Nobody cared then and nobody cares now."
BabyBumpsCanada,fmdiigl,t1_fmdfv8v,1585968698.0,"I doubt you'd do anything. It happened it me and there was nothing I could do. I was induced but wasn't told I was going to put somewhere (antepartum) my husband wasn't allowed overnight. When I was induced they put me in a really nice room with my husband where I thought I'd be staying the whole time. I was really excited despite having to be induced early.

Then after an hour I was told I was being moved and my husband would have to leave soon. I cried and begged but they didn't care. They also didn't believe I was in active labor and kept telling me I wasn't in pain. I also had an extremely sick room mate that was coughing and hacking everywhere or snoring like a freight train.

So basically I just begged and cried for hours for my husband and for help and never got any of it. My midwife saw me for two minutes at around 1am and said I wasn't in labor and to go to sleep. I insisted sleep would be impossible because of the pain. They didn't believe me and gave me earplugs because my room mate was so loud and told me to go to sleep. 

I gave birth around 5am which my husband obviously wasn't there for. Nobody believed I was giving birth either and nurses berated me for screaming, then for bleeding everywhere and not telling them (I didn't know, too much pain).

When my son's head was out they handed me a phone and told me to call my husband if I wanted him there. 

My son had to be resuscitated.

When I tried complaining about all this I was basically just told the nurses tried their best and are overworked and stressed."
beyondthebump,fmceeqr,t3_fuahwa,1585944073.0,"Eh, that's all a heaping pile of bullshit anyways. I basically spent a year indoors with my baby while my husband went to work every day. I didn't go out even once some months. My mom visited like once a week sometimes not even. 

Didn't have anyone else reach out me. What friends? What family? Yoga? Fuck off. I was battling a raging vaginal infection 8-14ish weeks pp that I couldn't convince my doctor of because according to him apparently blood and stinking goo and severe vaginal agony is normal for basically ever after birth. He told me he'd order an ultrasound. But that was like a year ago. No update yet!

Even now, 14 months pp and sex is still impossible. 

Also, Forget about all the help and support you thought you'd get if you had pp depression. There is none. You'll call every number, go to urgent care, the hospital and they'll tell you to get outside more and be happy!

Birth plan? Forget about it. Nurses won't listen. Midwife is a joke. May as get a bum in a back alley to help you give birth since they'd probably be more empathetic and helpful than the nurses that just try to convince you you aren't in labor and nowhere near giving birth. Oh, you think you're in pain? Here's some earplugs, go to sleep. Oh, you want your husband here? No, it's past visiting hours. You can cry alone and beg for help for hours. You start screaming for help when they baby a starts coming out? Well, that bum would have been really handy right about now because the nurses won't believe that either and just berate you.

At least they know how to resuscitate a baby when it comes out limp and lifeless and absolutely silent. I wouldn't count on that for all nurses though."

AskWomen,flr7duy,t3_fqbjhh,1585414495.0,"When I was about 21, I thought I woke up one morning with a UTI. Numerous rounds of antibiotics and all tests coming back negative for bacteria, I was told the agonizing pain/burning/urgency that kept getting worse and worse and worse was psychosomatic.

After months and months of begging doctors for help and a psychotic break, I was finally diagnosed. My bladder was shrivelled up like a prune and had so many ulcers is basically one big one. I had surgery, but it was too late, the disease wasn't curable, I was disabled for life. Can't do much of anything anymore. Life is miserable. I've spent lots of years confined to a bed. Only been able to work about a total of three years on and off in the last 10. Haven't been able to work in years now, but don't qualify for disability. So it's really fucking hard being a dependent burden to family.

Lost my friends, my pets, my car, my home, my dignity and independence. Can't even eat since basically all foods and drinks damage the lining of my bladder and make it a million times worse and can lead back to having ulcers.

I didn't know it then, but when I woke up that morning my life was mostly over and none of my dreams of travelling, of having a career, a house, would ever come true."
