It never feels good knowing the only thing youre being kept around for is sex.  You dont want her back, but you know she would want a chance, so out of respect to let her move on you should leave her alone. 

Speaking from personal experience- some people will do anything just for five minutes with the person they love even if it only ends up being more painful for them in the end."

relationship_advice,fqpiowh,t3_gk8etp,1589547352.0,"You know i like to think that in this scenario, if he really loved you he would fight for it to work. Im guessing the biggest issue here is his family being against you, not the other way around. If he really wanted this, he would make them understand. Im not saying its easy, im not saying its done in a day, but you fight for love - after all its his life but apparently they live it for him. 

I think you should end it. Even though it hurts, but why invest more time into something hes telling you is never going to stand a chance? Prove to him youre worth more, youre not gonna stand around till he gets married off, and that its his loss for being a wimp and taking your for granted acting like youre not possibly good enough.

I come from a muslim family myself and i personally think these standars are all bullshit, and that hes talking trash saying you can never have a future together. If he (and you) wanted it, you could have anything in the world working towards it."

The thing about moving on from a relationship to the next is that you dont allow yourself to heal, you bring your issues with you into that relationship - not having relfected on what you did wrong and what to do right.

If i were you i would let her go, she can live with herself if shes going to be that shady and secretive. For me a relationship needs full transparency - she cant do that. Youre too you to be letting someone do you like this, you might love her but how much does she love you when shes acting like this?"
relationship_advice,fojg3uo,t3_g7sxmf,1587819921.0,"I think you should give him a chance before you lose him entirely. He watched some videos, and okay it hurts, but does it count as cheating or even remotely close?

 I think if you dont give it another chance you might regret it in the future when you realise you did this for all the wrong reasons. 
Just let your guard down for him, hes begging for you back - you must mean alot to him. 

Set some boundaries if you decide to get back together, write them down beforehand. If he agrees to all the boundaries, then go from there, let it be clear if he breaks them, you cant be together."
SuicideWatch,fojezwf,t3_g7soqr,1587818990.0,Very true. Even if you do speak about it you only get responses like «you only have one life» «it gets better» «do things that make you happy».
relationship_advice,fojdncw,t3_g7so4l,1587817789.0,"Shed rather break up with you than let you see her phone. She wanted you to see it later? After what? After everything is deleted thats what. 

Let her go, this is not something you want to be caught up in. How are you supposed to trust her when she acts like this? You simply cant."
