a) not comfortable recounting what he has done to her. she's explained it was bad enough to put her in therapy, which generally means it's *pretty bad*.

b) trying not to get into specifics because her abusive ex could link this reddit to her and therefor learn her whereabouts and that he has a son, file for custody to learn her address, and then permanently *glue custodial obligation to her so she must remain in contact with him for at least 15 more years*

depression,fq3nhw2,t3_gglzew,1589068177.0,"I thought I would comment on this since I, too, have been in a place similar to his and for the same reasons. Any sort of hallucinogen can affect anyone differently. I've tried many of them, have had good trips and bad trips, and while there are ways and precautions to take before consuming to ensure a good trip, the fact is, you have no real control over what your mind is going to bring up. You could not have known he would experience a bad trip. You couldn't have prevented it, especially if he was alone, and the drug a lot of times feeds that depression and encourages you to hold it in and isolate out of fear of telling someone. Not to mention, if he had any un-diagnosed mental illnesses aside from depression (OCD, Schizophrenia, anxiety, etc), they would have been exasperated and exploited as well. And while some people claim there are ways to stop a bad trip, it ultimately has to be ridden out, which can last anywhere from 10-12 hours at most.

Please, please understand and realize there was nothing that could have been done in this situation. It's something extremely unfortunate, and I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I have had online friends as well -- my currently fiance and I were long distance for 4 years, friends for 7, and met online. It's extremely painful to lose someone you're close to, regardless of distance. I hope you find time to find a therapist and deal with this loss. There is nothing more painful than grief."
raisedbynarcissists,fpw48sj,t3_gfofdl,1588956984.0,"This is honestly so disgusting. I am so sorry they tried to offer you a half-assed apology to try and take your kidney, then sent your family to attack you as if you did something wrong. That kidney was in YOUR body, and honestly, I'm not a psychologist, but it sounds like Sebastian was probably suffering from ASPD and did NOT want recovery. He would probably never have changed, especially since he was enabled by your n-parents. Their apologies were not sincere clearly. He was desperately clinging to his life and wanted to show a tiny bit of remorse to get what HE wanted, not what you wanted.

If I put a gun to someone's head and say, ""I'm going to kill you if you don't apologize"" and they apologize, is it sincere? Of course not, they're scared for their life. People do desperate things when faced with death... and from the way he acted towards you when you turned him down is proof enough that you should feel zero guilt for keeping this steaming pile of shit alive. 

If you haven't been to therapy, I would go. Talk through what happened to you as a child; it helps tremendously. Go complete NC. If you continue to get harassed by family members, change your number. My sister had to change hers when my dad kept harassing her for money. Do what you need to do to move past this, but never feel guilty for what you did. You had no obligation to your abusers.

He regularly used his disability to excuse the things he said and did, like finding out my address and mailing me gifts that I never wanted or telling me what he would do to me if we had sex. I finally got through to a mutual friend of ours to help me talk to him because she, herself, was dating someone with autism and understood that his behavior was inexcusable due to his disability.

It took him using my grandmother's death to make it about him and how he wished he was with me to comfort me and how incredibly hurt he was inside he couldn't be there for me. I had tons of crap saved on my old laptop in case I ever had to file a restraining order. I would block him, and he would go on his stuffed animal accounts (I wish I was joking... I truly do, but he literally made FB profiles for his stuffed animals and TALKED to them) to harass me AS THE ANIMALS (or say stuff like ""Thomas let me borrow his account to talk to you. Why did you block me?"") and eventually I'd just unblock him to get him to stop because he had SO MANY ACCOUNTS it was almost pointless. Plus, I was young and naive and didn't understand what was going on. Probably the lowest point of my life. He continued to harass me for a year after I started dating my current fiance because ""we were meant to be"" before moving to another victim, whom I tried to warn about his behavior, but she brushed it off as his disability also and that I didn't have a right to judge him.

Not sure how old that made me. But my dad basically brainwashed my brother and I into hating our mom. My mom lived a pretty decent life, but my dad lived in the rundown trailer with my grandmother. We didn't have AC in the summer in my room, so I had to leave my door open and put a fan in front of it and hope it cools off. We rotated 3 meals after my grandmother got too sick to walk or do tasks--spaghetti, hamburger helper lasagna, and ramen noodles, all of which I cooked with no help from my dad. My grandmother would constantly talk shit about my mom and was just generally a piece of shit human towards us, mainly my sister because she chose to live with my mom. My dad was never around towards the end. He expected us to take care of him when she died because she raised him to be a narcissist. 

Trailer was falling completely apart. Floors caving in. Rugs dingy and dirty from never being vacuumed. Mold in the toilet and sinks. Shower never worked. No dryer so we had to hang up our clothes around the house to dry. We were so poor, before I went to college and started getting scholarship money, I washed my hair with dish soap... Yes, dish soap. My grandmother was also a hoarder; egg cartons, dog food bags, plastic bags, ruined jackets, magazines... you name it, she had it hoarded somewhere (closets, an old car outside, etc). I tried cleaning it out when she died but my dad got angry and said to leave it. So glad I finally moved out to live with my mom.

AskReddit,ffr854a,t3_eurjlf,1580152531.0,"I have multiple stories of paranormal, but this one has two other witnesses involved. 

Background: My mom purchased a house back in 2014 that was in a small town in Tennessee that was over 100 years old and had several owners. After the purchase of the house, and during the majority of the time we lived there, we experienced bad luck almost NONSTOP with life shattering events until I began actively cleansing both my room and the house. There was also multiple spooky things that happened in the attic and in the bedroom (formally a kitchen) that had the stairs leading to the attic built in. My brother formerly owned the room before moving out and then moving back in later; I took his room during the time he moved out. He saw things, heard things, and experienced things. I never saw anything, but I did hear things (whispers, creaks, etc) and experienced sleep paralysis for about 6 months before I began cleansing. Everyone except my stepdad experienced something or another paranormal for several years before I finally got it to calm down via cleansing. 

Anyway, on to the story: 

My brother had just recently moved back into the house and his room was in the foyer area of the long hallway connecting the front and back doors together. So there was a tiny foyer room that was blocked off from the laundry room next to the kitchen, my room, and then a wall with a see-through glass door on the side. In the tiny corner with the see-through glass door, adjacent is the attic door. When my brother moved back, since the house was only 3 bedrooms, we set him up a bedroom in that area outside my room in the corner. So his nightstand was literally against the attic door, and you had to move the nightstand to then pry the door open. This is important later. 

So, I'm standing at the kitchen washing dishes, which is the biggest open area in the house and I can see the light from my brother's lamp coming in from the see-through door. During this time, since my brother didn't have a room, I let him set up his TV and play video games in my room. So he was in my room at this time. My mom is coming out of the living room which is right next to the kitchen sink when she asks me, ""Do you smell cigarette smoke?"" 

I tell her no. I can't smell anything. It was around the time she had been getting cancer treatment and she stopped smoking, so I naturally told her she was probably just craving one really bad. She laughed and said I was probably right and returned to the living room. We chalked it up to that. 

About that time, I hear a loud BANG! from what I thought was the front door. Both my sister and my stepdad were out, but since my stepdad had been gone all day (since like six am hunting somewhere), I thought it was him returning, and kept patiently waiting for him to enter the room. After a few minutes went by, my brother came out of the little foyer area, opening the door, saying over and over ""Nope, nope, nope."" I asked what was going on. He then said he heard a loud bang coming from the foyer area, and went out to make sure nothing in the room had fallen, only to find the attic door bouncing against his nightstand. 

At this time, my mom came out after hearing what my brother had said and went to investigate. Sure enough, we saw where it was open. He moved the nightstand away and then closed the attic and tried to pry it open. It got stuck, and he had to literally force it open. He repeated it, and it did the same thing. We closed the door, and mom mentioned getting up before it opened, so we went in the living room and my brother jumped up and down where she would have stood to see if maybe it jarred. Nothing. My mom suggested the attic window might be open (we have a single window) and that the wind could be blowing. We think, ""Aha! That's perfect!"" and both go outside. We look up at the window, but see it's shut, not even cracked. And even then, there's no wind. 

Somewhat spooked, we enter the house and my mom goes to the living room, my brother and I walking back to the door. I joke about the spirit opening the door again, when my brother grabs my arm and says, ""OP, we closed the door... look."" 

The attic door was cracked open again. 

My mom at that time said she was going to turn the thermostat up because it was FREEZING in the house. She walked in and scratched her head. ""How can it be 75 in here? It's so cold!"" My brother and I just look at each other, and then it hits my mom. We all nope tf out of the home and decide to drive into town to calm down and grab something to eat. After eating, we return to the house being being warm. My mom goes to turn the thermostat down again. 

""You're not gonna believe this."" We walk into her room where the thermostat is located. ""It still says 75."" 

That's just one of many I have, but that's the one that has the most witness. It isn't the scariest, but it's probably the one where I have the most proof since my brother and mom both experienced it. Sorry it isn't 3spooky5me.

TL;DR: Live in a haunted house. Brother lives in room with attic door. Attic door swings open and hits his nightstand. We try to replicate it. Can't. Find the attic door open again after closing it. House gets cold. Turn thermostat up before leaving because we're spooped. Come back and house is the same temperature as we left it."

But everyone is right, and it's not my fault we struggled when I was a kid, and it's not my fault he's struggling now when I'm much better off. 

He also, when we confronted him the first time, told my sister that he thought we owed him for raising us, which she corrected and he became irate. I don't know why I haven't cut contact with him. But now that I'm 8+ hrs away, I think it's time. I just needed to hear it."

My brother went NC several years ago with him and urged all of us to do the same. I can't block his # because his phone is messed up and calls from restricted a lot, so I may go ahead and change mine."
AmItheAsshole,ff9tog1,t1_ff6014t,1579721035.0,"This. I worked in a gas station for 2 years. First job. Wanted to my best. They exploited the HELL out of me. No breaks; trained to do management without the title. Literally working until 12 pm only to get up at 4 am and come in to cook. No breaks; no lunches. I had no life, no happiness. People who say ""iT's YoUr JoB. YoU sHoULd Be GrATeFUl."" are absolutely full of it, and the manager is a bootlicker, too.

Fiance was exploited as well. Not to mention, they were CONSTANTLY updating policies at his job and revising and every time he was ALWAYS doing something wrong (such as pricing on Sat, then they changed it, didn't tell him, and wrote him up for not being near the register). It's absolute BS. And it doesn't matter WHO you work for. All retail jobs exploit their workers and set them up for FAILURE.

Retail management exploit their workers for profit, AND while I'm at it, it's extremely unhealthy for people to be forced to pretend they're something when they're not. It's detrimental to their mental health, and I can say once I left that type of environment and went to debt collection, my BPD, BP II, and depression got significantly BETTER.

Read that again: All my mental health was better when I switched to debt collection. I literally had less anger outbursts, less depressive episodes, and less mood swings because I was PAID BETTER, had MORE TIME OFF, and VALUED MORE than in the retail position.

OP if you can afford to quit, tell her exactly what you planned and walk out the door. Find something better. Get out of retail as quickly as possible. Your mental health WILL IMPROVE WHEN YOU DO."

I've looked into it multiple times, read about the effects, and unfortunately it isn't something accessible anymore. Thanks for the advice tho. Appreciate it."
childfree,fcywjzb,t3_ejlahb,1578088647.0,"How does it get better? How does it truly get better? Your kid then proceeds to become a young child (age 5-12) and then a teenager (13-17) and I'd rather pluck my eyes out than deal with a bratty, smug teenager honestly. Then, you'll get lucky if they haven't fucked their whole life up in HS, they'll move out to college, but then there's the worry they'll piddle THAT away as well. I mean, it's never over. Even if you successfully dodge the teen pregnancy, the drug/alcohol abuse, the bullying/being bullied, the dropout, the vandalism/any sort of crime problem, and everything else being a teenager could entail, you're still left with the ""what if's?"" of adulthood--you're money (IF you have money), you're estate, what's going to happen to you in a few years, what's going to happen to them, oh no, they're homeless and moving back in!

No one thinks about this. ""Oh, 18 years of this and then it's over!"" No, no it's not over. It's for the REST of your LIFE."
childfree,fcynixm,t3_eji17v,1578083366.0,"I refuse to pass on the mental illnesses and childhood trauma I have endured. I'm not interested in messing up a whole person (who never asked to be born) because of my mental health issues. And what's sad is, my family tries to say I would make a good mom. Talk about dense."
childfree,fcxetsx,t3_ejbj4s,1578061059.0,"I think it really just depends on your area and how many people live in your house. My fiance and I make around 77k before taxes together, which puts us in the middle class bracket. But if we were to have a child, our spending would go up exponentially. I have researched this before, and in our area (midwest) 45k was lower middle class income for 2 people. 35k was lower middle class income for a single person. I tried to find the article I read it on, but I couldn't find it.

This calculator should help you a bit more. It breaks it down based on geographical location in your state, how many people, and what you'll be bringing in. Hope it helps."
AskReddit,fbvbb0l,t3_eeoggr,1577128321.0,"I was bullied like my whole school life (lmao horray for being the ugly fat girl), but what really embarrassed me that I still cringe about was being on the bus in like 1st grade and having nowhere to sit except with my arch-enemy--some fat guy who literally bulled me for being fat (which made no sense, but I guess it took the pressure off of him). I sat down, and he started pretending I smelled bad. And I was one of those really sensitive kids, sheltered my whole life, so of course I started crying. And when I went to wipe my eyes from crying, he pushed me out of the seat onto the floor and EVERYONE erupted into laughter. 

Went home that night and wrote ""I deserve to die"" over and over in a journal. Pretty sure that was the first time I felt suicidal. It's almost 20 years later, and I still wish I was dead, hate myself, and think this moment pretty much sums up my current life."
