So we have a generation that grew up on something that never existed before. We don't know what the damage is. But I think it's a weakening of the human race.

Every generation does this to an extent, yes.

Honestly I hate explaining this to anybody younger than me. Though they hear me, you can't feel me. I could talk about it and you could read what I type but unless you have the age in you, you're not going to understand what I'm saying. This is more of a feeling thing an emotional feeling bound with wisdom.

We monitor multiple sites in multiple towns, Network and server infrastructure required for operation and daily use of the entire organizational footprint. Operating room systems, emergency room systems, satellite offices for doctors. Everything You Name It We monitor for healthcare related services. We have to coordinate outages and make sure systems are up and running as well as the network. The Millennials that I work with are hard-working (naive) but hard working. But the people on this site are so toxic. 

It's been very quiet thankfully. What I love about our generation is we get things done, no matter how bad it gets we don't bitch we take it in the chest. It's like we absorb the bad and put out good. We're kind of like rugged trees in a way you know?

I don't know, but we're really strong generation. I think our Gen is diametrically opposed to the younger generation. I really just cannot stand them. I get that they're young and have to go through the ropes through but something just really bothers me about the incessant whining, God fucking annoying as shit.

I think what made u strong is that we all had fucked up lives in a way that made us really strong. No wonder we like to party. I think we suffered growing up and can take a punch or two. But man, stop the whining. Anyway everyone be safe out there. God bless you and your families! ❤❤❤❤"

The thing is now the internet has created a whole bunch of youthful people that absolutely cannot be wrong no matter what the cost. No matter what you say or what you been through, them being 25 years old makes them a master of life. It's laughably bad and the thing is you can't even talk to them because they literally can't be wrong in their own head. I look forward to debating and being proven wrong because I learned something but with the kids nowadays, whatever you say is wrong and anything they say is right.

What I love is the fact that I have wisdom and that is data and education over time that the young people of this world just simply don't can't and won't have until time passes. If I had the choice to pick an age to stay at? It would be 40 because honestly young people have no fucking clue. But its funny to see what they post. We were all that age at one point and can relate it's nothing new and every generation seen it.

But without a doubt believe that its all meant for love. I do believe in a better place after we die but maybe it has to be believed to be seen. A lot of people, in my opinion have the wrong idea about what an awesome cool dude God could be. He could smoke joints, fuck hot women, party his ass off and want you to do it with him. But he eventually wants you to get your shit together and be a loving adult raise kids in a family that binds Society together in a loving Union of humanity. All the while smoking the good weed and listening to Bob Marley. But religion to me has gotten so far from a common sense God that it's up the ass of Southern Bible Belt pasty blue suit wearing motherfukers that it appears corny and stupid to a lot of people.

GenX,f3b7dzp,t1_f04c5tl,1570803560.0,"1975 here. To me the Beatles sounded blah. There was nothing really fun or interesting about how it sounded. Now U2 the other hand To Me the Edge and Bono bring to an emotional level in me that's at the core of my heart. They just can create a good Sonic landscape that inspires a lot of oh, well I don't even know how to explain it longing for youth in me.

U2 got its influence from the Beatles too. Go figure."
GenX,f3b6ko6,t1_f0mn4r8,1570802974.0,Those shows came out after the formative years of Gen X targeted dates. They're way too new. For me Seinfeld was awesome as a kid in high school we used to talk about the show at the bus stop. It was just funny show about nothing? S*** made me laugh. But that's why we're all different to each his own.
GenX,f3b6a94,t1_f0mfwx2,1570802761.0,Friends to me never was never interesting. Because I could never identify with the show's premise. I grew up very poor I just struggled my whole life deal ling with mental illness. The show is about rich white kids talking about s*** I couldn't identify with. Sitting in a Coffee Lounge with a barista serving coffee? In the nineties I just didn't get that I was busy surviving.

schizophrenia,f3a0gie,t3_dg7jyn,1570759148.0,"I have this delusion also. I feel as if this entire reality, including you and this post is all for me. I can pause people and affect this reality the way my mind thinks. The thing is this is a belief that is why its problematic. I need to get over this belief and end the delusion so my mind can get back to normal thinking. But really. What if this is a matrix and we are here to make movies for an advanced civilization? And my reality is that everyone here is the civilizations AI all for me. It's kind of scary to think about which would mean that we are existentially alone but the thing is we'll never know this so why put ourselves through this pain of the delusion. Why not enjoy it and be happy with what we're given. It's hard to get by this delusion but I think the mind is bending it against the belief of this is real and we're all independently thinking Minds. I suffer from this delusion right now and it sucks bad."

Cruising up and down the Joisey shore from Cape May to Wildwood, to Ocean City to SeaIsle in the early 90s was the shit! Bone Thugs n Harmony or U2 or Snoop Dog. Oh man that was the best!"

AccidentalRenaissance,f38ljy0,t3_dfye6l,1570737659.0,I did this commute for 6 years from Worcester to Boston and back. What really sucks is when you work a whole day and at 10 they decide to stop the commuter rail to let every single person out of Fenway Park. Isn't that a treat. Never again.

Some of us had it harder than Millennials have it now so you can't help it realize the fact that some of us went through much worse and made it okay without the bitching, see?"
