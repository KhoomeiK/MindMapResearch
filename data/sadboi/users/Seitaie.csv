Maybe you think people cant change and the only way racists can actually do good for humanity is to die but they are still people xD.

As for me having a mental illness, lol no have you not heard of memes or emojis they add some flare to your boring text, use it sometime.

Also everyones a little racist, its called prejudice and even so ive alw heard more chinese propaganda than american ones so shouldnt I be more inclined to be biased towards china.

Ive been trying to agree with some points with you but you are too blind to even notice, and sure I dont know much but isnt it ok to just say what I think lol.

Also singapore isnt that authoritative but yea it kinda is, only in the way to keep the cities rep clean. I disagree with sg sometimes but it definitely doesnt restrict me to  go against it lol. 

Also bruh, the bat shit ok fine lets say it isnt true then how did the virus originate? Pls enlighten me because I cant find anything on the internet and the strand is thought to be from bats so what else am I supposed to base this on also a wet market? Ok whatever"

And hellooo?? Ever heard of singapore, apparently they are doing pretty well rn even tho I agree china did an amazing job and the gov does deserve praise for controlling the disease despite being the previous epicenter, lol.

Also if you want a racist to be more open to views dont you gotta atleassttt try to sympathise a little bit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 try thinking for a lil while.

How about trying to be more impartial to both sides before making a judgement LOL we have a US one and now a china one im going to die from the exposure 🤣🤣🥱🥱

Yea ok, never in that comment did i say shit bout the government I just said MAYBE YALL SHOULDNT HAVE EATEN FUCKIN BATS DIPSHIT, so stop clownin and get over yourself 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 

Tf propaganda its legit true and LOL BEFORE YOU SAY IM BIASED TOWARDS AMERICANS, I literally dont even like them even if I were to be bias it would be to china are you insane lmao 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

But I dont think its fair that all chinese looking people are suddenly lumped into this hate circle, most of us have never even been to china before. 

And its mostly the governments fuck up why should the people be to blame, perhaps the people are also liable but I dont think we should deprive them of human needs just because the world ""wants blood"" I am extremely grateful for you not lashing out on random asians but people in china are still people, albeit kinda sucky ones. They have families and loved ones too.

I think, yes china does need to make changes and it does need to own the fuck up but I do not think the people need to be involved in this, atleast not to a large extent."

My deepest condolences, although that probably means nothing from a stranger online and I hope you are strong enough to overcome this adversity. Im truly sorry for my people but please dont hate all of us. It is no use spreading hate for people who like you have nothing to do with it and are just experiencing the aftermath of the problems those specific problem chinese cause.

Im aware that words alone are worthless in this situation but im seriously rooting for you, and im sorry for the pain and trouble we have caused.

Once again, sorry and good luck."
