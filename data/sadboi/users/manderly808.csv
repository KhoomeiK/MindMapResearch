He is now incredibly unlikely to get married and have a family (not that I even know if that's anything he wants - he's never dated in the 19 years I've known him), but any life away from his parents is all but gone. 

Pretty soon, the narrative will be that he has to stay home to take care of his aging parents. And then when they die he'll be alone, suddenly unable to afford the lifestyle they provided him his whole life.

I can't remember the last time I felt that worn out. 

Sadly, we weren't able to find Boomer, but as a normal caring human, I said ""Boomer's missing"" and my husband up and got dressed and drove 45 minutes to bust his ass to look for our sweet old boy. He asked as we left, defeated, if we should come back the next day. He didn't question my parents' responsibilty, he didn't sit and play his computer, he just fucking looked for a pet that's been in our family for 15 years because that's what a normal person does. 

So, your husband is either a terrible person, which honestly would have come to light long ago, or he's struggling with some mental shit right now that is making him not be a functional human being. Either way something's gotta change.

Coronavirus,flvaftg,t1_flv1exl,1585519721.0,"It's called a loan not a line of credit. It's a lump sum loan paid back in installments. It's also a *secured* loan since the property itself is collateral. It's not just someone saying ""trust me with this money I'll pay you back"".

A line of credit is a revolving amount you can borrow up to a limit and pay black repeatedly. 

Maybe settle down and reconsider your unsubstantiated outrage."
Coronavirus,flupdad,t1_flum16o,1585507260.0,"I don't think you understand how buying a house works. They look at your credit score, income, and debt to income ratio. 

You're not applying for a $300k credit card. 

And yeah, if you make minimum wage you aren't buying a $300k house. But owning a home you can afford means building equity and usually lower payments for the same thing you'd be paying rent on."
Coronavirus,flup2rg,t1_fluerei,1585507089.0,"A mortgage isn't the same as a line of credit. 

I brought home approx $600 a week in 2003 and bought a condo for 135k. The rent I paid for my studio was $650. The mortgage I paid for my 2 bedroom was $860. Yes that was 17 years ago, but it's not insane today. 

I had no money down, no loans from family. I was surrounded by people who told me I COULD do it, not people who told me I was delusional. 

We're going to be buying again this year, my his fan will be using is VA eligibility and again need no money down. 

Buying a home (whether an apartment, condo, house) is not some fake bootstrappy American dream that's really unattainable. 

You're so busy telling yourself it's impossible. Why don't you talk to a lender and see what they have to say."

That's how you start. You don't need thousands. You just need to start small and its grows fast."
Coronavirus,flu882i,t1_fltud8d,1585497331.0,"I was 23 years old making $20,800 a year and was approved for a home loan. I happened to get a promotion before I bought and I got a big bump in a salary and therefore a big bump in my mortgage amount. At $36k I ended up with a 135k apartment with a mortgage of $860/month no money down FHA. 

I was living paycheck to paycheck then. I had no savings. I was a first time home buyer with a credit of about 700 at 23 making approx $18/hr (but rememebr was earlier approved at a job making $10.80/hr, just for a lower amount) so stop whining about how it's impossible to buy a house and go talk to someone. 

You'd be surprised at how not-impossible it may actually be."

Coronavirus,flm8qbp,t1_fllur49,1585277261.0,"I live for these stories of innovation and charity. Seeing production lines literally gear up to build ventilaters instead of cars, billionaires sending PPE and aide to other countires, doctors and nurses ""graduating"" early, volunteering, and coming out of retirement, people building masks out of spare hospital parts, masses of people manufacturing open-source 3d printed valves, little kids sitting at home busting out dozens of hand sewn masks, and little Facebook groups forming to reach out to isolated seniors in need. 

Shit. As awful as this all is, I hope that this spirit of ingenuity, resourcefulness, and selflessness that has been re-ignited in us continues. America, and the world needs to see what it can actually be like when we work toward a common goal."
