They have not acknowledged ANY of the contradictory information that we have found out about covid. They disregard any positive data or anything that makes the lockdowns seem like a bad idea, and continue to push the exact same story they were pushing a month and a half ago. Even though most infections came from people at home, 5000+ deaths were people in nursing homes, the likelihood of catching covid outside if you are a reasonable distance away from someone is almost non existent, they are counting people in the covid deaths that were never tested or who died with covid but not from covid, the antibody tests indicate many more people have had this than they want ro acknowledge, and the likelihood of dying from it at all is very small if you're under a certain age.

Risk of dying in car crash 1 in 103 if there's a paywall

WhitePeopleTwitter,fqxgf6c,t1_fqxehpw,1589731899.0,"There is absolutely 0 evidence that 5% of our population would die in the next 9 months. That's outrageous. 

I'm not interested in defending or insulting Trump. This isn't about him. 

The stats I gave you about car accidents do include immunocompromised people. 

And no, my solution isn't simple. It's logical. What you aren't taking into account is that the lockdowns are not stopping the virus. It's not like solution a is stop the virus and solution b is let it spread. It is spreading regardless. Even before the lockdowns were in place, it was spreading rampantly for at least 2 months, and the hospitals never came close to veing overwhelmed apart from NYC. We found a solution to that problem in the javits center and military ship. They went mostly unused. 

My solution is reopen the economy, yes, but there are several reasons for that. All we are doing now is artificially suppressing the virus. And not even by a significant amount. Most people are out and about and interacting with one another, even if it's in a different way than before covid. It's still spreading. However, we are going to get a second wave when the lockdowns are lifted, and they have to be lifted. It's only been 2 months and things are bad. We are running out of money to throw at this thing. Food shortages are starting to effect grocery stores. People who've now been without an income in over 2 months are starting to get desperate and pushback. Sweden and Georgia and Florida have shown us that these lockdowns don't actually improve the numbers. Those places are fine. Sweden took an initial hit, but now they're over the hump and they're on their way to herd immunity."

You're ignoring the fact that people are suffering and desperate because they haven't made a dime in over 2 months, cant feed their families, and are genuinely scared of the future & dishonestly claiming that it's about bankers and billionaires. Most landlords are not bankers. They are regular people who depend on the money they get from their properties to survive.

 The infection rate of covid is very high, I don't think anyone is claiming otherwise. But catching something and dying from it are very different. You are more likely to die in a car accident if you are under 50 years old than you are to die from covid.

 There have been studies released that warn about the spike in deaths that we are going to see in the next few months to a year not from covid but from people being unable to receive important cancer screenings and other so called ""elective"" procedures.

 I understand you're trying to insult me and that's fine, but hopefully even if you walk away from this thinking im a selfish awful person, you'll at least be somewhat more open and understanding towards the actual other side of the argument. Not the bs that you're hearing about people wanting haircuts and only caring about big business and wall street.

 Teen suicides are up due to the isolating effect of lockdowns, suicide hotlines have reported a 1000% increase in calls, around 30% of small businesses will not be able to reopen even after lockdowns are lifted, people are struggling to eat, developing countries are already dealing with hunger caused by the lockdowns, the UN estimates over 150 million children will die as a result of the global economy shutting down, places like California and NY are broke.

 In NY teachers, Doctors, Nurses, and state workers are losing their jobs because in the case of medical personnel, the hospitals are empty and there's no money to pay them to continue working. This is happening all over the country. In the case of education and state workers, the state is broke so they are making cuts. 

Things are very serious and to pretend it's an easy choice is very dishonest. We do not have the ability to eradicate this virus. We may never have a vaccine and even if we do, by the time it's developed we will possibly have already reached herd immunity. 

I am willing to take the risk of getting sick because I know my chances. If someone else is not willing, I completely respect that and if someone is in a vulnerable age group or has preexisting conditions, I think those people should be protected as much as possible.

I'm not going to listen to disgusting losers who are living in their moms basement attack me and speak to me in such a gross way about my imaginary dick being sucked or anything else about my private life. Think what you want ✌
newyork,fqwa2be,t1_fqw343r,1589697308.0,"No, it isn't."
newyork,fqw2vvg,t1_fqvv1vn,1589691332.0,"Thats actually not true. At all. The case numbers are declining. Even in atates that have reopened, they're declining. Even at the peak our hospitals never got overwhelmed"
newyork,fqvutzg,t1_fqvh5u8,1589685694.0,"Well you can think whatever you want, the fact is we won't be fine if these lockdowns continue"
Conservative,fqvo5ys,t1_fqv8s5u,1589681438.0,Me too. I got a message specifically saying my kids (6 and 1 years old) deserve to get covid and die because I wanted to take them to a park to play outside. People are so nasty
Conservative,fqvn6y5,t1_fqv22pg,1589680830.0,He did do the Heritage foundation and also you need to understand that channels like these have helped to inspire a whole new generation of conservatives. They are entertaining but most of them are also informative. It's kind of condescending to just dismiss them because they don't meet your high standards. Channels with that kind of serious policy focused discussion sound boring to me. I get enough of that in my polisci classes. But that's just my opinion. People like different things and that doesn't make one better than the other
Conservative,fqvmqq9,t1_fquvlnu,1589680558.0,"I didnt know a ton about Fuentes but I'd heard his name a few times. After I saw the video of him harassing Ben Shapiro while he's carrying one of his kids and walking across the street with his very pregnant wife and other kid, I was disgusted and lost any potential respect I could have had for him. It was so nasty and inappropriate. It was Nick and group of guys, idk who they are, but they followed Ben and his family all the way across the street until they went inside somewhere. You don't do that. Anyone with an ounce of decency knows that"
newyork,fqvglna,t1_fqvfqpo,1589676834.0,"That's not going to cut it and everybody knows it. These videos are made with good intentions and i think it's cool that people are doing it, but the real issues are being avoided and ignored and it's going to cause serious problems for this country and this state."
newyork,fquuq8e,t1_fqus7uw,1589664848.0,"He actually didn't do that. He didn't disband the response team in the sense that he just did away with them. Due to restructuring, the team was technically disbanded but many of its members went into similar roles where they still focused on pandemic response. He also never told anyone to inject bleach or disinfectant. He posed a question about its possible use to the Drs on the stage with him, which did make him look silly, but he never said for people to inject anything. He actually provided more supplies than was needed, which is why places like NY are giving away ventilators and sent the ship away."
7LittleJohnstons,fquqqrj,t1_fquqe7l,1589663138.0,"I don't think that's really a big deal. Teachers aren't trained to physically intervene except in life threatening circumstances. And a simple accommodation would be to have an aid in the classroom. If she's a childcare worker, she wouldn't be alone anyway. The ratio of kids to providers ensures that at least 2 people are in each room at all times."
newyork,fquqfmt,t3_ghrsih,1589663001.0,"It's the right thing to do period. We never should have shut down, which is becoming clearer by the day and instead of Cuomo taking responsibility for his bad call, he's doubling down. This is bullshit. Millions of people are suffering and losing everything they have. The state is flat broke and teachers, medical professionals, and state workers are getting laid off. These phased reopenings are nothing but political bullshit and nobody is pushing back on anything he's saying or doing"
newyork,fqupvx3,t3_gisqf1,1589662761.0,Don't.
newyork,fqupn30,t1_fquap5k,1589662652.0,"How? The Constitution is very clear on this. States have more power than the fed in times of crisis. It's designed specifically to be that way. Trump has given supplies, ventilators, a damn ship, and everything he's been asked for. He signed the stimulus package immediately. He has not used this crisis to seize power for the federal Government unlike the Governors like Cuomo, who have shown that they are nasty people who don't care about the citizens who are suffering and losing everything from their lockdowns. They also have no regard for the rights that we have as individuals and the freedom that we are entitled to.

Edit. I'm sorry to hear that about your dad. I have someone I love very much in a nursing home as well and it sucks."
newyork,fqup65w,t1_fqugx4o,1589662441.0,"That's bullshit. Like always, Cuomo defenders give out half truths. As you well know, Trump immediately signed off on the ship being able to admit covid patients as soon as it was brought to his attention. It was dumb ass red tape and he rectified it as soon as possible"
newyork,fquox0z,t1_fqtu7qr,1589662331.0,"How is it a narrative? He mandated that they be let back in to their nursing homes. That's a fact. Where else could they go?? Let's see.. how about literally anywhere other than a building full of the most vulnerable population possible. Javits center was empty, the military ship was empty, they had no problem constructing makeshift temp hospitals for covid, they easily could have done the same for the sick nursing home residents."
newyork,fquokxk,t3_gku33n,1589662186.0,Now do one for the millions of people who will starve to death from the shutdowns
7LittleJohnstons,fquocmr,t1_fqunls5,1589662084.0,Im well aware of our unemployment rates. Its also a fact that childcare is an industry that will always have openings. Children aren't going away anytime soon.
7LittleJohnstons,fqumc9l,t1_fqoanh1,1589661200.0,"If it was asked genuinely it's not offensive, but i don't think ut was."
7LittleJohnstons,fqum2ed,t1_fqugzrp,1589661079.0,"Anna is going into a childcare field, there isn't going to be a lack of jobs in that industry so idk what you're talking about"
Conservative,fquer7g,t3_gkxudb,1589657596.0,"These people are honestly retarded. I wish someone would push back, just a tiny bit. Ask this douchebag how. Give some examples of how Trump has been ""genocidal""?"
Conservative,fquc539,t3_gkzj7e,1589656105.0,Jesus
Conservative,fqubxqx,t3_gkz648,1589655990.0,Because she presents herself as an expert or someone knowledgeable on the subjects she speaks about and she isn't. Which normally would be fine but her ignorance has the potential to cause irreparable damage to this country. See her green new deal and all of her livestream suggestions as examples.
Conservative,fqubfok,t3_gl000o,1589655709.0,"Love this! The only disagreement Ive had on your ratings are Amazing Lucas and Hunter Avellone. I wish you'd give Lucas another shot because he is pretty funny but I understand personal preferences and stuff. Now hunter on the other hand, lol, I cannot stand that kid. He used to be ok until he decided to get all ""enlightened"" and now refers to himself as a free thinker. Not conservative or liberal, but a free thinker. 🙄🤢. He's a trend chaser to the extreme and his jokes are just so unfunny. I agree that he's way too.. idk the word. He has a bad attitude overall. 

Thank you for doing this! I really look forward to these. So fun. I also love Fleccas as a personality, he seems like a sweet guy and he's pretty funny. Did you warch the episode where he went to Dragcon? His outfit was ridiculous lol"
TheBlackList,fqtsxdz,t1_fqtska2,1589645478.0,Lol ty ill fix it
Conservative,fqtrjkn,t1_fqtk9ew,1589644710.0,"See this is what pisses me off most. They're playing games while people are suffering and dying, and I'm not even being hyperbolic. This is real life and for them to just treat it like a joke or a game is unforgivable"
Conservative,fqtnpy9,t3_gkpc00,1589642543.0,"Favs are Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. Oh and whoever that guy was that showed the picture of reagan riding on a dinosaur with a rocket launcher strapped to his back and did that whole thing where he trolled the shit out of the green new deal. Idr his name.

Least fav are all the rest. Idk some of them so they might be cool."
