So think of it as a spectrum of vulnerability. For some people, who have very few risk genes, no amount of environmental pressure (such as trauma) will cause them to develop bipolar, although they might develop other issues. This probably represents most of the population. People on the other end of the spectrum, who have very many risk genes, will develop bipolar no matter what happens to them. For everyone who has some intermediate level of risk genes, environmental factors will determine whether or not they develop the illness. 

Also, ""genetic risk"" is not the same as ""having a family member with the diagnosis"", although the two are obviously correlated. Seeing this misconception popping up in the comments."

Preventing the development of SMI (bipolar, schizophrenia) in people who are vulnerable to it has been an aim of researchers and clinicians for a long time. Your house analogy is spot-on. We know that every episode a person has increases the likelihood they'll have additional episodes are often lowers their level of functioning between episodes. 

The issues with this are primarily: 1) We don't currently have reliable information on how to do it, in part because the studies are awfully difficult to conduct. There's one comprehensive approach that I'm aware of, and it's for intervention in first-episode psychosis with the aim of slowing or halting the progression of the underlying illness. At the point that some has had a psychotic episode, though, there's not much ambiguity about whether they have SMI. Catching people *before* they have their first episode is the dream, but presently we can't sort those people out from people who look very similar but don't go on to develop the illness. The false-positive rate will be very high in any group identified as at risk. 

2) There are costs associated with treating people for an illness they don't have, and labelling them with a disorder they won't get. In the US at least, people are fairly cavalier about giving psychoactive substances to kids with, as you say, developing brains. The side effects of the kinds of medications that would be used to prophylactically treat bipolar or schizophrenia (and again, we don't have any evidence that prophylactic treatment is even possible yet) are pretty brutal to inflict on teenagers on the hope that they *might* get the disorder and this *might* prevent it. 

In the case of even younger children, those who are receiving a bipolar diagnosis well before they've shown any pathognomonic features (that is, episodes of mania--basically one doctor decided that bipolar disorder manifests completely differently in children and started a trend on extremely thin evidence of diagnosing, essentially, difficult irritable kids, as bipolar) it's much worse in terms of the potential effects on their brains, and on how they'll see themselves for the rest of their lives."

mentalhealth,fk1f5ww,t3_ffy2mq,1583778423.0,"First off, don't feel ashamed of having these thoughts and urges. Obsession with people is stigmatized, but it's not different from other obsessions people can't control. Your commitment to keeping other people safe comes through in your post. 

I've had this happen to me...many times. Usually after a breakup or separation, when I'll become deeply depressed and fixated on the person. Sometimes its more of an unrequited love situation (in these cases I tend to be more manic than depressed--I have bipolar). It always runs its course, although not always before I embarrass myself or damage relationships because of it. 

For me, either the obsession ends when the mood episode gets under control, or I move on to a new obsession. So those would be my two suggestions: 1) see if you can figure out, with the help of mental health professionals if possible, whether there's an underlying mental health issue that can be treated, and 2) see if there's anything else that would capture your attention in a more benign way. I don't want to sound like I'm just saying ""oh, try to think of something else, maybe take up cross-stitch"". It would have to be something else that's compelling enough to take your focus off your ex boyfriend, but also relatively harmless, in the sense that becoming temporarily obsessed with it wouldn't be worse than your current obsession and ideally would naturally fizzle out over time. 

I think of my obsessions like black holes in my mind. My thoughts get sucked toward them and take other thoughts with them...until it feels like everything is connected to the obsession. Anything you can do to interrupt that process and keep the black hole from growing is good. Carve out some space in your life that's ""obsession free"", as much as you can manage. It can be as small a thing as brushing your teeth. See if you can catch the moment when your thoughts start to turn toward him, and redirect them. *This is really, really hard:* expect to fail more than you succeed, especially at first.

Also, the half-life thing doesn't work the way you think it does. My partner notices if he misses a single dose because of the short half-life. When someone is doing a taper of any drug, they'll often be switched to something similar with a longer half-life, to mitigate withdrawal symptoms.

Different people feel that pressure in different situations, but we're all afraid of the same thing--that people will reject us and we'll be alone. 

Apologies for my brevity here, as I'm on mobile. But I have a little hack that I use for situations that make me very acutely anxious (including messaging friends, which is something I really struggle with). 

First, I think about the thing I'm afraid to do. In your case that might be hitting up a friend to hang out tonight. I ask myself, what is the absolute worst thing that could happen if I do what I'm afraid of. And I sit and really think about that, and let myself feel a little bit of what I would feel if that did happen. The key here is to really take your anxiety, the thing that's driving your avoidance, seriously. Let it tell you what it's so scared of, and let yourself feel that fear. 

Then, I think about what I could do if that absolute worst case scenario happens. No matter how outlandish the thing my anxiety tells me might happen, I imagine how I could cope with it. Sometimes I'll even write it down, the outcome and the coping strategies. 

In your situation (and I'm really spitballing here) the worst case might be something like, ""If I call A Friend to see if they want to hang out with me, they might not want to, and they might be so offended by my thinking that they wanted to hang out that they tell all of their friends that I'm terrible, and I get cancelled and none of their friends will talk to me."" And the coping strategy might be ""Well, I know some people that this person doesn't know, so even if they decide to blow up my reputation because I wanted to hang out tonight, I'd still have people to talk to. And maybe they'd calm down over time and I could convince them to un-cancel me. In the meantime, I could confide in Other Friend who I'm pretty sure would still stick by me."" 

In my own experience, going through this process can really diffuse the anxiety that I'm feeling and open a door to actually doing the thing that I'm afraid of. If you decide to try this, I hope it works for you too. Either way, welcome to r/socialanxiety , you're in good company."

It's enough that I was able to go off hypertension medicine, at least. It's also been an easier and calmer year, because alcohol has been taking up so much less real estate in my mind.

Buspar and gabapentin come to mind if you have a lot of anxiety. They aren't billed as antidepressants but they have that effect in some people. 

Tricyclics are an entire class of antidepressants that are less used now, but sometimes people who don't respond to SSRIs do well on tricyclics. 

There's SAM-e, which is an over the counter supplement in the US but prescribed some places in Europe, iirc. It acts on 5-HT, NE and DA so it's fairly potent. 

Sometimes people respond to a mood stabilizer (such as lithium, depakote) added to their antidepressant but not the antidepressant alone. 

I have even heard of people prescribed stimulants (such as Ritalin) for recalcitrant depression but probably not a great idea if anxiety is in play too. 

What you've responded to in the past (if anything) and what your depression ""looks like"" (what symptoms you have, what patterns they exhibit, what bothers you the most) would suggest which direction to go. Also, sometimes when people don't respond to treatment for depression, something else is going on (anxiety, like you mentioned, or ADD, bipolar, ASD-spectrum, lots of possibilities) and that has to get sussed out first."

You had every right to do whatever you needed to to get away. He was assaulting you. 

I've been in this same position. My partner used to like to physically restrain me to tickle or tease me, which would often cause me to flip my shit, for the simple reason of being trapped and manhandled by a loved one who found it funny despite my protestations. It was no BFD in his mind, even if I was begging him to stop.  I can only chalk it up to some kind of pervasive unconscious misogyny that makes otherwise good guys feel like they have the right to treat women like ragdolls if they find it amusing. 

Do not let him guilt you into feeling bad about what you did. **You did nothing wrong.** 

If he ever tries this again, suck all the oxygen out of it for him. Don't play along, look him dead in the eyes, and say with no trace of humor that he needs to stop, immediately. Repeat that he needs to stop until he does. Scream if he won't listen. If he persists in spite of all that you're entitled to do whatever you need to do to get away. If he keeps pulling this garbage and acting like you're the one with a problem if you don't like it, it's time to scram."
bipolar,f9w7f2x,t3_e78gjx,1575688235.0,"There was (maybe is, not sure if they're still alive) a bipolar patient who became an object of medical curiosity for their clockwork two day cycles--one day depressed, one day manic, rinse and repeat. I think the person eventually got stabilized on medication, though my memory is hazy and I can't find the source. 

I'm not sure about the veracity of that statistic (the four episodes per year) but either way, you're not alone in rapid cycling. People's rhythms really span the gamut. I used to have very rapid cycles (before my Dx, on antidepressants w/o a mood stabilizer), and I still have more than four 'subclinical' episodes per year (too short or too mild to be full blown eps). I assume the small army of pills I ingest every day is keeping them in check. 

It sounds like you have a lot of awareness and knowledge about your own rhythm, which is awesome. It also seems like you've adapted to be effective within the cycling so you can meet your goals and obligations. Your knowledge gives you a lot of informed reasons and places to try to intervene in the cycling, either behaviorally or with medication, to promote stability. It's also awesome that your treatment is helping you--this is definitely something to bring up with your team. In particular, therapists might have behavioral suggestions for, let's say, putting nails under the manic tires and greasing the skids of the overladen depression sled.

Your husband is abusing you, OP: he's blowing up, screaming, and calling you horrible names with no provocation. **He is physically assaulting you.** Because you *told him about a dream*, something you felt you could confide in him about. It's horrifying to hear about what he's done to you, and on no reasonable person planet would you ever be the asshole for this. Huge gaping monstrous NTA, OP. Your husband is 100% in the the wrong. The horrifying, criminal wrong.

I want to hope this was an isolated incident, but the fact that you were afraid to tell him about the dreams for so long makes me think it wasn't. Has he done this before? Is it escalating?

I'm worried for your safety if you stay with your husband. Is there a place you can go for awhile to get a clear head and think about all this without the pressure of what he would approve of hanging over you?

I'm not saying that you need to divorce your husband straight away. There's so much we can't know as reddit randos. There could be mitigating circumstances, he might be amenable to change, etc etc. I'm sure you love him dearly, and I believe he's worthy of love despite what he's done. But you need to be clear-eyed about your situation. For now, he's a danger to your welfare, and would be a danger to your children if they existed. Stop trying to have his baby, step back, and think very hard about whether you want to spend your life and make children with someone who treats you like this. If he's willing to knock you around over a forking dream that you had, unless that incident is some kind of freakish anomaly, he'll knock your children around if they don't do or say what he wants. Please take it from someone who grew up in an abusive home: don't bring children into the world in a situation where they will be treated so poorly. If your husband can't or won't stop abusing you, find someone else to raise your babies with.

I'm so sorry you've gone through all this. I don't know where you're located, but you might want to look for supports (peer or professional) for people in domestic abuse situations. Honestly I just want to give you a big hug and say ""hun, you did not deserve what happened to you"".
