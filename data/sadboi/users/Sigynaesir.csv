Satan, Barbatos, Siemon, Lucifer, Belphie, Levi, Asmo,   Solomon, Mammon, Beel, Diavolo.

bipolar,f6z5vf6,t3_dtw8in,1573309923.0,"Welcome!

1.) I'm going to be honest. I absolutely love being manic. It's so rare for me to have an episode that it's incredibly addictive to experience. My main anti-mania motivation comes from my dad -- He doesnt control his disorder. Growing up with that resulted confusing childhood. I dont want that for the people in my life.

2.) Mania is usually followed by either depression or a ""flat line"". As mania is rare due to my type, I usually only broke out of mania because of a depressive  episode.

3.) Relationships are.. landmines? I dislike people in general. I focus a majority of my energy into school, work, or my pets.  It's impossible for me, someone who has more depressive episodes, to maintain many relationships  at once. My friends understand that sometimes I have to step back for mental health reasons and the ones closest to me usually dont mind that. It does make friendships harder to form."

Local laws are same as federal. Once it's in the dumpster, it's free game but stores obviously want you to buy stuff rather than grab it for free. If you get caught, dont return to that store for AT LEAST two weeks. Avoid stores that are dont have any ""cover"" around. [As in you can see the dumpster from the road]"

Thank you for your input! The line of another mortal beings creating us did raise a more few good question for this fictional line of thinking.

If they created us, was it purposeful? Or an accident? 

If it was on purpose, were we a learning step for them to create and why the hell did they decide to tell certain humans their ""gospel""?

If on accident, is that why the god/s cant fix anything? Are they even aware they created us?"

HomeworkHelp,eyvji3q,t3_cz06fe,1567497425.0,"Solved!

Dtermining the angle [in degrees] based on the graph. I found a similar problem that helped me.

6 revolutions = 6/4 = 3/2

3/2 * 2pi = 6pi/2 = 3pi/2

Then we like at the triangle and know it's a pi/2 - pi/3 - pi/6

Since 3 and 6 are not at the origin point we can say pi/2-pi/6 = pi/3

Pi/3 * 3pi/2 = 2pi/6 * 9pi/6 = 18pi/6 = 3pi 

Convert to degrees
3pi * 180/pi [pi cancels]
3*180 = 540 [0*3=0; 8*3=24; 1*3+2=5]

Answer: 540°

Feel free to check my math."

I'm not sure about most people but a lot of individuals tend to have multiple items on a keychain. The key was free of Teressa's DNA, blood or otherwise. Say SA did kill her and the keys were on her body. Wouldnt blood get onto the fabric of the key? In a tiny crack? Under the key's black part? SOMEWHERE? 

Second question: bones

The bones were never conclusively identified as human or not. They were given to the family and renamed as human bones.

Given the advancement of science, is there now a test that can tell if it has the anticoagulant? Why did the blood in official police photos look fresh?"
