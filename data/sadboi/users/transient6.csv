antidepressants,fqmlwgn,t1_fqhd661,1589479616.0,They couldn‚Äôt really do anything. They had me deep breathe and watch the heart monitor to try to reduce my heart rate with my breath. They sent me home after several hours and just told me to stop taking the meds so within a day or two I was completely back to normal. The psychiatrist also put me on way too high a dose considering it was my first time on meds. After this they put me on something else and at like a pediatric dose lol because they were scared it would happen again. But it‚Äôs a common thing with Celexa in particular. If I had stuck with it maybe it would have gone away after a few weeks but it was just too intense of a side effect to stick it out any longer.

My heartbeat randomly got so fast at one point that I woke out of a dead sleep and was like this isn‚Äôt normal, I might die. So I called 911. The ER couldn‚Äôt do much except monitor me. They had me deep breathe and literally watch the heart monitor and try to control my heart rate by my breathing. It helped a little. It came in waves.  They wound up sending me home after a few hours and telling me to just stop taking the meds. So within like a day I was a lot better. I might have adjusted to it had I stuck with it, I don‚Äôt know. But that was my first time ever on meds and the psychiatrist put me on a crazy high dose. After that he gave me a pediatric dose of something else cuz he was too scared to give me anything substantial lol"
