AmItheAsshole,fr5bbnz,t3_gmrpgs,1589905722.0,"Definitely NTA. It’s none of her business and she needs to learn to quit sticking her nose in it. You’d think she would have figured that out when she got you literally disowned but here we are I guess. Props to you for even letting her back in your life, but I wouldn’t blame you in the slightest if you didn’t want her to be anymore after all this."
AmItheAsshole,fr5azhz,t3_gmrqm2,1589905561.0,"Nope, NTA. She’s old enough to know manners and use them. She sounds a bit spoiled."
AmItheAsshole,fr5astq,t3_gmrqsq,1589905471.0,NTA as far as I can tell. It doesn’t seem like she was being very civil in what she said and if you only said what you said here in a calm tone then I don’t see the problem with what you said or why you would need to call down.
AmItheAsshole,fr3c0kp,t1_fr2yhxx,1589854163.0,If you didn’t want her to leave you then you should have been up front with her before now. Chances are good now that this is going to do irreparable harm to your relationship.
