AskWomenOver30,fos536w,t3_g95gyr,1588024127.0,"Like others who are commenting, negative people like this rarely change unless they get serious outside help. I dated a guy like this for 4 years. We were/are still colleagues in the same field and on friendly terms due to work. 

I was once very in love with this guy, and thought I was going to marry him. We broke up when I was 28. The reason? He thought I was better than him, and it made him too depressed. He said he couldn’t keep seeing me succeed and feeling inadequate by comparison. He also said he “just wasn’t happy” and thought being single would fix that. 

No matter how much I supported him, encouraged him, complimented him, reasoned with him, etc., he couldn’t shake the thought that I was better than him in certain areas, and this caused him anxiety and grief. He felt the same insecurity and contempt for his colleagues and friends. He criticized everyone around him, but saved the hardest jabs for himself. He got into this negative loop about himself until he was rendered immobile. 

I thought that he would change once we broke up. He went on to marry another person from work. I just heard from him (we are part of a circle of mutual friends) and, in so many words, shared that his wife’s recent success in her career was great but it kind of undercut his own career aspirations. At the end of the conversation, it was clear that his partner’s happiness was threatening to him. 

Without serious outside help, people like this don’t have the tools or vocabulary to work on their own happiness. And they feel uncomfortable and insecure when they see other people experience joy or self-sufficiency. Everything and everyone around them becomes a sign for why they aren’t good enough, why the people around them aren’t enough to stay happy, why what they’re doing isn’t enough. 

You’re not doing anything wrong here, but you won’t be able to do anything right, either. You can’t win because the game is rigged.

Edit: grammar"

And then once you’re in AA: “if you don’t do the steps in AA/leave early/sit in the back/etc. then you’re not truly sober. You’re a tourist.” 

And then once you’re fully involved, doing the steps in AA, etc.: “if you’re still struggling in your recovery, then you’re not spiritually fit.”

There is a certain crowd in AA that compares and measures their own progress against their peers. Shit like this keeps people from trusting themselves and their recovery.

AskWomen,fnfcgdi,t3_g1a2uw,1586905440.0,"I think everyone responds differently to therapy  based on what they need. I attribute a lot of my improvements and success to the strong relationship I had with one of my therapists. 

I used to believe that therapy didn’t work for me. I’ve tried therapy a few times to get a better grasp on my issues. The first three therapists were fine but I didn’t “click” with any of them. I felt like no matter what I shared or struggled with, they would have a very safe, predictable, and generic thing to say back. I felt like they were kind, compassionate, and competent people, but they came off as a little too cool, distracted, or uninterested during sessions.

Then I started working with my fourth therapist once a week for two years. He was very active in my treatment and wasn’t afraid to ask difficult questions, react to what I was saying, challenge me, or call me out when I was repeating problematic thinking, patterns, or behavior. I felt like he was really listening to me and invested in my recovery. As a result, I started to take myself and my problems seriously. I did assignments, showed up, told the truth about things I usually sugar coated or denied, and worked hard on my issues. After two years, I reached a place where I felt I could leave therapy and use the tools I was taught. By the time I had my last session with this particular therapist, I had already achieved so much: sobriety, stability, a successful career change, a degree, and a partner who eventually became my husband. I felt like a transformed person. 

I really can’t stress enough how important it is to find a therapist who you really trust and can actually be honest and have “real talk” with. It makes a huge difference in how you see and treat yourself."
AmItheAsshole,fmqlbez,t3_fwp5gm,1586301867.0,"ESH. But only because of way you snapped at Carly. If it was a simple, “we said no. Please let us enjoy our day together” then all is good. But the part about Carly needing to get her own husband is going a little too far.  It communicates a boundary, sure, but it’s really voicing an long-standing resentment and so your response was indirect. Instead of saying “I said no” you’re implying that you’ve had it with ALL of her behavior and with the friendship dynamic between Carly and Jake. That’s got to cause whiplash for those who can’t read your mind. Carly doesn’t necessarily know you’ve been tolerating her behavior all of this time.

Now...Tbh, I would have said the exact same thing as you and maybe even more in the heat of the moment. But I know I would’ve sounded extreme in hindsight. 

I imagine Jake knows about you “being patient” about the situation. If he does know your feelings about the friendship, then he sucks for not working with you to resolve the issue. But if you told him everything was fine, it’s hard to fault him. 

Carly sucks because she shouldn’t be inviting anyone to come over anyway. Not sure where you’re from, but most states are sheltering in place. Her furniture can wait."

askwomenadvice,fkc3wo8,t3_fhgutv,1584045294.0,"I’m sorry, but if you’re not willing to work on yourself then how do you expect others to want to work on a relationship with you? When he said “do your part,” he was asking you to work on your insecurities and past hang ups. The “anxiety inducing” environment you speak of was as much created by you (if not, even MORE so based on how you described your reactions) as it might have been from his comments. 

This is a very clean cut case of pushing someone away with your neediness and constant demands for validation. It can be difficult to hear that you played a part in all of this, but owning it will lead to progress. By working on these insecurities, you will learn how to be much happier and stable in your relationships down the road— not only with others, but with yourself too."

AskWomen,fik950c,t3_f888ol,1582475613.0,"I used to be a people pleaser: accommodating to a fault, everyone’s friend and confidant, and extremely considerate. I used to tell people I liked everybody and that everyone deserves support and a friend. I would sugar coat problems and twist people’s stories so that they came out as the wronged party in a difficult situation. Basically, I became very good at telling people what they wanted to hear in order to stay stuck in their problems.

 This invited a lot of wounded people into my life, including people who weren’t willing to work on their issues. In fact, my kindness and accommodating nature enabled some people to continue being jerks to others or dysfunctional in some way because they always had me to confide in and “understand” their point of view.

Then I got sober. I realized that I wasn’t really present with people—I was simply putting up with people or drowning my feelings with alcohol. I started to have a filter in how I chose relationships and I even dislike people in sobriety. That scared me at first because I knew it meant people might not like me either. I was used to being liked by EVERYONE. Now I found myself not being everyone’s cup of tea because I had boundaries and shared my real opinions on things. I realized I was becoming more attuned to the people whose company I enjoyed and the people whose behavior was a red flag. 

Recovery was an important breakthrough for me to become less “nice” all of the time. Now I work hard to meet people where they are and be respectful and honest with them instead of excessively nice and essentially fake with them...which helps no one in the long run."

Afraid of following through with it, I left their place in a panic. While leaving, and unsure of where I’d go next, I had the clearest thought: “you need help with your drinking, and you can’t do this by yourself.” It was such a strange, new thought.

They think normal conversation means getting a rise out of people. They also think that they are the only unique friend you have, so the rules don’t apply to them. They instigate, provoke, dominate, bully, and manipulate the situation to suit their fucked up needs. Usually they have major insecurities about not being cared for, listened to, or liked.  

I’m glad you said something. She needs to hear it more often until it sinks in and she changes. Or, she’ll try to turn everyone against you. Or, if that doesn’t work, she’ll flit to another friend group and share some sob story about how shitty you all were to her throughout your friendship.

AskWomen,evbeqzq,t3_cj25ln,1564374745.0,"I dated a lot of caring, attractive, intelligent, and interesting people throughout my twenties— men and women. But I always felt just “meh” about them, or felt like I was settling. My family said I was too picky. But the truth was that I thought they were settling for me, and that I was unlovable, so I felt guarded around them and tried to find reasons for it not working. I convinced myself early on that these partners weren’t “the one”, but they were there, and we were comfortable, so I’ll ride things out until they leave me...which they did. No one wants to stay with someone who is just “meh” about you. And I overstayed my welcome in several relationships out of convenience. 

Then I chose to be single for a year because I knew I had to get my shit together, and I couldn’t stand how unhappy I was. I also knew I was the common denominator in my failed relationships and I needed time and outside help to figure out why. I started working on my intimacy and self esteem issues through therapy, among other things. 

Another six months go by and no dates. But I feel pretty good about life. Suddenly, a guy I’ve always thought was attractive, and who I admired and respected for years, starts talking to me more and more. I’m extremely antsy and nervous around him, but happy about the development. He used to be shy around me, but now he starts warming up and inviting me to events. Something about all of the inner work I did changed how I related to him: although he gave me some “crush” anxiety, I was playful, self-assured, confident, and friendly instead of evasive and aloof. Because of this, this very cute guy felt comfortable around me. We eventually start dating, fell in love, and now we are engaged. 

I always thought I would get married in my twenties, but here I am about to walk down the aisle in my thirties. It’s a great age to fall in love—not only with your partner, but also with yourself.

AskWomen,evai0d4,t3_cixhw0,1564348199.0,"Years ago, I became friends with a woman who was a lesbian. She and I would have talks about whether or not you could be queer if you’ve never had sex with the same sex. I was always of the opinion that, yes, you could be queer and a virgin (ex. There are straight virgins). She wasn’t sure she could call herself an actual lesbian until she had sex with a woman. I didn’t see the point in “proving” yourself by sleeping with just anyone before you were ready, but we agreed to disagree and left it at that. 

Soon after, she asked me out. I said no because she kind of had a victim mentality all of the time, which wasn’t attractive to me. She was also just not my type. She faded out for awhile and avoided me, which I expected. I then saw her a few weeks later in a food court with our mutual friends. She had handcuffs on. I asked her what the handcuffs were for. Our friends started saying she had been wearing them for weeks, non-stop, like it was some kind of bad performance art. I was like WTF WHY? 

She nonchalantly said she was doing it as a way of protesting against all of the women who wouldn’t give her a chance in dating. She felt like the women turning her down were keeping her from REALLY being a lesbian, and imprisoning her in the heteronormative world. It was extremely bizarre behavior and I pretty much stopped hanging out with her after that."

AlAnon,eus0zzt,t3_ch9uo6,1564001728.0,"Wow. This really hit me hard. I’m sorry you had to go through all of it: the hope, shame, loss, joy mixed with fear and trepidation, the grief that extended way back before her death. You are not to blame, nor could you anticipate or do things differently here. Please believe this. You could have said the perfect thing, done the perfect thing, and it wouldn’t matter. In the end, we are only responsible for our own actions.

No one here is wrong in this situation either—it was a natural progression of untreated alcoholism. You are right about the deadliness of this disease. 

I’m wishing you well and lots of space to feel whatever you need to feel."

askwomenadvice,eu02rgb,t3_ce691k,1563340841.0,"You know... I had a very hippie/stoner roommate and I swear it was so hard to get her to put her toilet paper in the toilet and flush. Everything was bad for the environment to her. She didn’t like flushing or putting toilet paper in the bowl either because it was wasteful and toxic to the ocean in her mind. So anything was left unflushed and in the wastebasket: paper, liquids, solids, blood. 

I would complain and ask her to do it a different way and she would scrub the floor around the toilet with “natural remedies” like that was the issue. No, girl! I’m gagging at the smell of the bowl and bin! 

I moved out as fast as I could once I found a new place because of this and other incredibly bizarre reasons. Good luck.
