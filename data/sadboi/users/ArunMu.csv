relationship_advice,fcwkp0c,t3_ej3aq7,1578028287.0,"Hold on, I would say. What I find one thing concerning is that she thinks you would cheat. You can probably counter argue that women also cheat like men, but that would not take the topic of contention anywhere.

If you truly believe that you are happy with her ( I would prefer you take some time off and think about it from another perspective. Probably get opinion about her from your closest friends etc) then is it a possibility that she is heavily brainwashed by her mother ?

By the way, to answer your another question, that kind of expectation is absurd and if she continues to insist on it, then it's better to leave her. It is a possibility that she is expecting you to leave her and be the bad guy in the breakup.

Tough times ahead, but I really hope that you sail through and reach a shore. All the best."
programming,fco1tpg,t1_fco0kd0,1577822539.0,"I can understand your situation quite well. For real world case, if you are going to work more in the cloud area, chances are that if you know containers, kubernetes, go, python you will get really good opportunities. While at those you can improve your Rust skills for future data plane jobs . 

Having said that, I am not leaving my C++ skill set behind. I have just stopped following it as closely as I used to do. Need to get stuff done :)
Just basic c++ is not enough for the market. You should know to work with other libraries and mostly very close to the C layer or sometimes with heavy template based libraries. Depends on your kind of job.

In short, make an informed decision based on your career path that you are interested in. If you see C++ being prominent then you should pursue it aggressively. Otherwise better utilize that time to better your domain knowledge and learn other language or framework that might actually help you finding a better job."
programming,fcnw0at,t3_ei6ws8,1577819552.0,"Though I like C++ because of how much time and effort I have given to it and also because of how ducking powerfully it is....but honestly I would prefer working in Go/Rust combo and get problems solved. I honestly don't see any takers for it to develop a new product. But I am ready to be pleasantly be surprised if that's not the case.

Hope it becomes much better and improve programmer efficiency as well."

Please do write whatever you feel like. This is the right sub Reddit and we would all be glad to have you write things. Those of us who have time will read it and those who dont, won't. As simple as that.

Hoping to see more of your writings :)

Have a great day."
AskReddit,eug1mpf,t3_cg95s3,1563797794.0,"Good question. Something I keep thinking about like others. The reasons would definitely vary between persons and age group.

Right now, my reason for living is:

1. To experience all the senses. We are so fortunate to smell, taste, feel, loved, be happy, be sad and so many things. I want to enjoy all of them.

2. Seeing!! The world is such a beautiful place, with equally bad places. I want to see it all and experience the different cultures. But I am doing nothing towards it though.

3. Nurturing. Would love to raise a tiny tot daughter.

4. Understanding. Probably there is no point understanding of the universe. But I am curious about it. Why do we exist may be completely meaningless, but it's meaningful enough between us. That's good enough for me.

There are many more things which kind of overlaps with what I have said. But that's the gist of it."

Don't worry about making people happy or angry.  It's not much under your control. Perhaps you are just too worried about interaction with people ? It's not that bad out there you know :)

But I really want you to apply and give your best beam. You will be just fine. All the very best!!"

I can only ask you to not feel guilty because you are not. Try to become the person your sister would have wanted you to become. Make her proud."

How do you define madness ? Something that one should do that is the norm ? But yeah, I am drawing a trajectory here. If you realise that you are going or thinking that is out of norm, then you are normal."
