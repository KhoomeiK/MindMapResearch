I can understand and speak English (2nd language) because I was exposed to it a lot when I was a kid, but I couldn't explain it grammatically.


My advice would be to train your brain and cultivate its understanding of the language as much as possible outside of formal classes and courses so you can consolidate what you learn academically.

First you can start by watching some shows, movies etc that you're familiar with, but in German with English subtitles. Imo this is one of the easiest things to do when learning a language, because since you already know the characters and what's going on on the screen, you can focus on listening the language to be familiar with it. This is especially useful if you're also using more ""academic"" resources (eg courses, apps etc) because with time, you will spot out commonly used words and pick up the structures of sentences, and you may even be able to pick up a few slangs and so on the way that wouldn't be taught formally. While you won't be able to speak it just like that, you'll roughly understand simple sentences and eventually you'll even be able to get more complicated sentences. When doing this you shouldn't try to 100% translate what you hear to English but rather understand it, because even when you meet words that you don't know, your brain will be able to ""fill the gaps"" and grasp the meaning of the sentences, if that makes sense.
Maybe you can spice it up and listen to/read child lullabies, stories and such, or maybe go on YT and watch German podcasts ! Anyway, the goal is to familiarize yourself with the language as much as possible when you're not formally learning it so you slowly lose the ""I'm not getting it""-feeling when reading, as well as the feeling of hearing an alien language when you hear people speaking it.


Extra bonus point +++ If you can afford a trip to the country at some point. 


Lastly, remember that learning is a long journey; it can be hard but it also feels super good when you notice how much you've improved; becoming fluent in a language is one of the most fulfilling feeling imo. It also opens up new cultures, and new people to speak with.
Obviously the more you practice a language the more you understand it, and the more you can learn even more of it, so stay patient and try to make it fun!"

I really do wonder how the game is coded for it to create the interactions we have, for instance back when Death Pulse gained the regen-on-kill component (after Sadist was removed to introduce Ghost Shroud I believe), if you stole the spell as Rubick, gained a regen buff by killing units and stole another spell, you'd keep the regen until your death. I can sorta understand that making it into the game because it's not something you can guess, plus it was a new update and Rubick gets funny interactions, at least they were quick to notice it and fix it.


But then there are some other things like Beastmaster's boars launching attacks at the outpost when ordering for all controlled units + hero to take the outpost that are easy to notice and don't get fixed. Again I can sorta get around these things with brand new updates, but it's something that shouldn't happen yet it's in the game since 7.23. At least boars attacking an outpost have no impact on the game unlike other interactions... I'm still baffled by some of the things that somewhat go through testing (if there's any), like introducing Snapfire and Outposts in the same patch, but not noticing that Snapfire can cookie outposts out of the map ... small indie company lol"

I've had friends when I was a teen who identified as straight (romantically and sexually attracted to women) but who still fooled around and experienced with me then, and who now exclusively date women. Doesn't mean they were closeted or anything, just curious.


My point is a man can identify as straight and still be curious about other men. In the same way that I can want a one night stand to find out how sex with a woman is, a straight man can dl grindr looking to be sucked off by a dude because they're genuinely curious about it. Doesn't mean that I'll start dating women; this experience will not make me any less gay and automatically turn me bi, because it was just that : an experience. The same goes for straight men. 


Hell maybe after experiencing with men they'll start exploring more and actually start identifying as bi, or even exclusively gay, who knows? But this ""actUaLLy, YoU'rE nOt StRaIghT, yOU'rE cLOseTeD"" attitude is very unhealthy for us to have imo. The goal is rarely to genuinely help people accepting that they may indeed be closeted; most of the time it seems to be said to somehow mock/point fingers at people, like this post. It's also one of the reasons why some actually closeted dudes may be afraid to explore their own sexuality, leading them to stay closeted because as soon as they show interest they're instantly labeled. 


We're praising ourselves for not labelling ourselves to strict roles and going with the flow. We don't like people telling us that we're not actually gay, just confused.

She has plenty of controls and you can really turn around teamfights with Maze/Terrorize. Terrorize can also combo really well with plenty of things (e.g. Puck's Coil).
Regarding point 3, she's great at picking off heroes with Veil once you get the hang of it.

Also if you're greedy you can get an Aghanim and the AS talent at level 25 lol

The only downside for you I guess would be point 1, she does have 5 active spells (+ items) so she can have mana issues - keep ferrying clarities throughout the game and you should be alright. (Also, don't use all of your spells to kill/control people in situations when 2 can work)"

My understanding of this is that the meta is teamfight heavy, where you want to group up with your team a lot.

...minor/medium spoilers about the battle if you want to prepare :
●

●

●

●

It's basically the same battle as when you reunite with Claude; you start with Byleth and Dimitri against a huge chunk of enemies and the rest of your class joins you in small groups, but there's a few things that make it harder imo.



- Unlike Claude, Dimitri doesn't start part 2 with his relic, so be careful what you had in your inventory during the battle to protect Garreg Mach. You can't super-combat art to deal with the dangerous foes right away like you could with Failnaught, and he also has less speed so it's likely that he will get doubled by those fast myrmidons/assassins, be careful. And to top it off, his personal class doesn't have a (flying)mount, so in addition to being slowed down by walls and bushes, he can't hit and run like Claude. (He does have a large aoe gambit so use it well to stall time while you wait for everyone to join).
- Most (all?) of the myrmidons have Pass so it's hard to really create chokepoints. Besides the myrmidons rushing you, you'll also face multiple archers with poison strike so your HPwill burn quickly even if you don't get doubled.


- At the start of part2, the game takes Dedue away from you and gives you Gilbert as a replacement of some sort. However Gilbert is a bit worse than him and joins as an armored knight with an imprecise weapon (steel axe) in a chapter full of archers with poison strike, fast myrmidons with axebreaker&pass, even faster assassins that can poison, and a lot of bushes. Even his gambit isn't precise.
- The one who joins with him is Ashe, so while he's a somewhat decent combat unit and/or can deal some cheap damages with bows, he normally can't take a side by himself. As mentioned before the myrmidons have pass so you can't hide behind Gilbert, who will either miss or just get plain ignored by the enemies, so it's very likely that Ashe will get doubled and die if you want to use him. I think the best you can do is either try and get off a few safe curved shots, or make him a wyvern prior to the battle so he can join Byleth/Dimitri.
- At the same time Annette and Mercedes join you on the opposite side than Ashe/Gilbert, but they're typically not particularly brilliant at combat either and if you want them to join asap they'll be in range of enemies (archers or puncher-guys I think ?), again unless they can fly to you or maybe hit and run if they're Dark Knights, the best you can do is use Physics with Mercie(and maybe dance for a second use if Annette is your dancer)



So yea, it turned out longer than I expected but in the end I think the real difficulty of this chapter imo is the first wave of enemies that rush towards Byleth / Dimitri ; I really wanted to warn you about this particular chapter because so far in part 2 I haven't had nearly as much trouble as I did in this one (in fact the more you progress and build your units the easier it becomes, even if enemies do scale well), and if I didn't have this one save file of two chapters earlier I legit couldn't have passed it. (Because no preparation screen and I had Mercie stuck in a stupid class to grind some skills etc + my inventory was a mess) That's also why I gave general advices because well maybe you'll make everyone a wyvern and can reunite super quickly or idk ,  and it's true I wasn't well prepared on my first tries, but even when I did prepare my units knowing what would come it was still a close call. I was so mad that the game took away Dedue that you have since chapter1 lvl1 to give you Gilbert with not even an iron lance, he's really useless in that chapter and your actual typical potent combat units (Felix/ Ingrid /Sylvain) join last and at the opposite side, once you're done dealing with the first wave of enemies lol."

Or maybe I am haha. Overall I was more speaking about giving quick infos than giving directions, but in the end I guess we just have difference experiences because :


>they won't listen to your voice if they're not listening to your pings

When I said the ""Help!"" chat wheel often get ignored I meant that in a teamfight there's so much going on that yes you can't read every chat and see every ping, especially if it's something vague like ""Help!"". Even with pings, I have to look out for where it is, and then decide whether or not I can actually help, while the fight may still be going on. (vs instantly knowing ""X is hitting me at Y spot""-- oh X has bkb on for the next 7 sec, or Y spot is too far, better stay here to kill Z with the others)
Or if someone's getting dived, I can tp much more quickly if he says ""I'm getting dived t1 bot"" than with just pings (especially since people like to wait to be almost dead to start pinging). It's also easier/faster for the person getting dived to press one key and talk, than to use pings and chat wheel.
Other than that I can agree with not listening to people who spam pings and voice chat. I don't like it when someone else does it and tries to play captain with the other 4, unable to shut up for more than 5 sec -- especially since they often make stupid calls or sometimes it results in other people arguing with them. I also hate the ""go Rosh go rosh""/""go push go push"" screaming in mic after a successful fight.

However 
>everyone already knows what to do

That's my main issue, in my experience they don't. I can often find one farming inefficiently (eg hitting small camp when they're just next to a 3-ranged creeps creep wave that's getting killed by ours), or running around aimlessly, or 2-3 people splitting up after a successful fight.
I strongly feel we'll achieve much more with a team goal/""cohesion"" than by not communicating at all simply because each of us assume the others know what to do- not to mention there are often more than one valid option, and we can't expect our mates to know what we have in mind for the next move. In these occasions, I've found the occasional ""what about X/I think we should Y"" (rather than ""do X/go Y"") to be useful.

Last 3 games I played with her were lost games mostly because things went south between my teammates (out of the 3, there were 2 when people were insulting each other in mic/threatening to afk lmao) and I believe I wasn't at my best either. Like, at some point I decided to try and transition into a right-click build but we lost before I could, but I usually don't go for a right click build.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I always start with a set of Tangos (90), Sage's Mask (325) and a Mango (70) = 485; which leaves enough gold for either :

* an observer if the pos5 didn't buy both;
* a sentry to block the small camp and prevent the enemy pos5 from pulling, or simply deward
* a smoke

&#x200B;

With the gold from bounty runes, I complete Basilius from the side-shop so I can help my offlaner. I can get my boots pretty early if I manage to get a kill (ideally, the offlaner or pos5 has a stun) and/or by using arrow on large jungle creeps.

Then I go for a Wand either before or after completing Arcane (depends if I'm roaming with success, if yes then I rush them). I don't always go for it but Urn is great since you're roaming so much and you can get it from Basi, you want it to get Spirit Vessel if they have high Hp heroes.

For the core of my build, most of the time I go for Eul's (rather than Atos). It's cheaper and I like the MS boost, + the mana regen more or less lets me stop bringing clarities and spam arrows/starstorm without too many issues. At first I went for it because I wasn't confident hitting arrows, but now I pretty much always go for it since it's nicer to have a guaranteed arrow than to miss hit (in fights unless I'm hidden or the enemy is too busy, I find it better to arrow when I have a guaranteed set-up). The Eul's/Arrow combo pretty much ensures you don't miss (people can still Force staff out of Atos), and I like the lock-down/purging debuffs&buffs from Eul's more than the root from Atos.

Then I like going for Meteor Hammer from the earlier Sage's Mask; when you're ganking a single foe it's great to combo with Eul's/Arrow for further lockdown, but I also like that I can push with it when my team lacks pushing power and I don't go right clicks. But I guess it's my thing, it's by no means mandatory.

I guess every thing else depends on the situation :

* Blink is an option to close the gap/position yourself.
* The usual ""get it if needed and no one builds it"" : Mekansm, Pipe...
* Even if you don't go for a right click build, Medallion/Solar Crest is always good on Mirana to quickly kill an enemy/buff your cores. It also builds from Basilius's Sage's Mask.
* Ghost Scepter if you're dying to right clicks (eg Ursa). Can transition into Ethereal for more disable/magic damages.
* If you check my games you can see that I went for Aeon Disk once. Again it's pretty situational but I couldn't do a thing in fights without dying so I dismentled Arcane.
* Aghanim's Scepter gives you a second Starstorm, I guess it's nice to farm faster and for your damage output in fights but it's not my thing when I'm pos4.
* You can get a Lotus Orb if there are specific things to dispel/turn back at the enemy.
* I like going Hex, even tho it's expensive you have a lot of lockdown with it.
* You can even go Dagon for a magic damage build, but it's expensive for a pos4.
* Force Staff is always a good item when you play a support role, especially if you want to Force Staff your mates out of a specific danger (Cogs, Viper's Aoe+atos etc). You can even go Hurricane Pike and transition to a right click build if that's your thing.

I feel like it's somewhat of a mistake to still build right click on a pos4 Mirana, but if that's your thing :

Phase Boots rather than Arcane (allow you to position yourself better/chase + brut damages boost that goes well with Leap's AS boost). Drum can be good both for you and your team. Dragon Lance expands your already good range but I don't feel like it does much as a first core item; instead you can go Diffusal for to compliment your attacks and slow fleeing foes that'd have survived your initial assault. (And the mana burn works well with your lvl20 talent)"
learndota2,f1cnrox,t3_d8magz,1569361508.0,"You already got some answers but I'll add my 2cents on pos4/5. Please do note I'm 3.7k so while I don't have a very high mmr compared to others here, I also got out of lower brackets playing almost only pos4; anyway here's my personal advice :

&#x200B;

When you play pos5 you want your carry to have the best time possible (aka ""babysit"") until you can leave him alone (so he can get that sweet solo xp and you can move around). Since you're the pos5=the one who theorically gets the less access to farm, and because you want to keep the map warded, you won't have a lot of gold. That's why you want to spend it in cheap items that help you and your team (boots/wand/smokes/glimmer/etc).

You'll also be behind the others in terms of xp because you have a lot to do : stack/pull camps to ensure your lane doesn't push too far, put a ward or two to protect yourself (and the others) from ganks, harass the enemy offlaner so your carry can safely farm... Your pos1 will get some xp that you won't since you'll be away doing other things. With Tomes at min10 you can get your level 6 anyway so it's not really a problem, but life can be rough when you don't know how to play from behind. Long story short you have to get things done with very little more than your spells and 1-2 utility items.

&#x200B;

All roles are flexible but pos4 can pretty much move around very early, so it's more than ""the offlane support"". You can for instance start with the offlaner, try and take a kill if your hero is a good roamer (eg Mirana) so the enemy safelane starts with a death/your offlaner has a good start and can be left alone. You can camp mid (not advised in lower brackets, people think you're ""stealing xp"" especially if all you do is sit behind the trees). You can help the safelane if they're having trouble. etc

But anyway yes in general you'll probably start with your offlaner to help him get the ball rolling. Think of it this way : Pos5 wants his carry to have the best game; pos4 will want to make the enemy cores' life hard. So, harass when you're on the lane. Secure the denies to give the pos1 less xp (especially on the ranged creep). Secure the ranged creep last hit. Prevent the enemy support from pulling creeps. If your offlaner is agaisnt a lane that can easely kill stay with him for a few levels until he can be left alone and you can go make things happen elsewhere. etc. In some cases you can even stomp the lane so hard that force the enemy pos1 out of his lane, so you end up with a scary offlaner+you, the pos4, roaming around and killing the enemy mid/coming back to kill the pos1 if he shows up. (this is an example of a best case scenario but hopefully you get my point, which is that you can and should make stuff happen as a pos4)

You should also help your pos5 getting some support stuff -- get some sentries/dust(if needed); maybe get an urn if you already have arcane boots and your pos5 is still working on brown boots... But you also have access to more farm than the pos5 theorically so you can aim for at least one or two major items (like a Blink or something).

&#x200B;

Take Rubick for instance. He's almost always played as a support but imo he makes a poor pos5 compared to other options, because his stun has a 31 sec cd which is super long on the lane - so you can be sure the offlaner(s) will be playing around that and dive you when it's on cd. His nuke is good but it pushes the lane because it bounces around the targets and also reduces their damages (so the enemy creeps will have less health AND deal less damages than your creeps, resulting in the lane constantly pushing). So there's not much he can do to give his pos1 a good life on the lane (unless you're a super aggressive lane, and even then..)

However he makes a really good pos4 because he trades really well with his nuke against a lot of pos5 supports who could try to zone you out. He can reduce the enemy pos1's damages to make last hitting/denying harder (and pushing is not as much as an issue). His stun is weak early on but it's instant so he can decently gank/tp to other lanes and make things happen (eg lift someone who dives your mid and get a kill). He's also a bit reliant on items to work well, unlike a pos5 hero. See how the same hero's goal&performance change if he's played pos5 or 4?

&#x200B;

Also, a last note about farm priority : yes supports are the ones who are meant to get the less farm. But Dota is about doing the most out of the resources the map has to offer, and some supports can clear creep waves and small to medium jungle camps decently with their spells and a few right clicks (eg Keeper of the light), and while they don't need too many items they certainly perform better with one or two than with boots only,  so don't be afraid to clear a camp or two to get the gold you need. Now, I'm not telling you to sit on a lane and farm (you should be playing around your team) or to take the creeps away from your core, but if you're near a wave of creeps no one is going to kill... don't let it go to waste ! Instead use your nuke+right clicks to quickly clear the wave and shove the lane - you'll get a decent amount of gold *and* you'll be doing something useful! This is especially true in lower brackets, where cores don't know how to farm well and there are often 1 or even 2 free lanes of creeps no one is killing.

Of course, unless you're about to finish a key item or you want to kill a creep to get a ward because you're broke, don't walk in the jungle if your carry is farming there. But also, if you're 20 min into the game and you keep dying 200-300 gold away from your Blink dagger as Earthshaker, your team should know to pause a little and give you a bit of farm. What I mean is, farm priority can shift sometimes and it's all about knowing where&when to farm (cores and supports alike), but that can be very hard and confusing in lower brackets where cores (and even other supports!) think you're just supposed to sit in the back and not touch *any* creep at all."

More seriously tho, you mention harassing while staying behind the creeps; how do I do that without getting creep aggro and fucking our lane?


I play pos4/5 and I'm 3k3mmr. I try to improve but man it's hard when sometimes people think I'm working against them. Like, someone in the comments suggested to secure the ranged creep if my core can't do it especially for the first 2 waves since the xp we'll gain is more valuable than a few 40 gold my mate isn't even sure to get. This is very true, especially since at my level some people can't seem to cs properly.
So I'd love to do just that and secure our xp and all but when I do it I get pinged into oblivion by my core, even if they were 100% not going to get that cs!

Also:

> walk to tower and die

Honestly I'd love to as well, I've already seen it in higher mmr games and have it explained to me many times, but in my bracket I just get flamed to death/pinged 100 times if I pull this off, even if I explain why I'm doing it. Now I'm playing with a carry that thinks I'm feeding/doesn't trust me, and it'll get thrown back at my face if I die again. 

I know I can mute but 1. I want to communicate with them and 2. even if they're muted they still play like they have a feeder in their team, because well that's what they think when they see me suicide for seemingly no reason after ""stealing"" their ranged creep. Obviously I just don't do it right now but how to approach these kind of things (like securing the range creep) without my team thinking I'm working against them ?
Like, I don't want to stay passive and play like I've been playing for the past months without trying more things to improve, just to not tilt some people. But I also don't want to turn my team against me and get pinged for the next 30 minutes..."

learndota2,eufc1r0,t3_cg2dys,1563768903.0,"Hey, great post ! SF is a hero I love playing but I still have a lot to learn and itemization/talents is often a dilemma when playing the hero so I'm really interested in this thread and what others have to say.


There are a few things that you haven't mentioned and that I'd like to discuss :

    ● About the physical build(that I'm more familiar with):

• I feel like physical-SF can well benefit from a fast Drum after Treads, as the item is cheap and easy to build and provides good bonuses for the Hero : MS/small mana regen (partly similar to why you want Eul's in the magic build), AS&MS active boost and a bit of stats. All around I think it's a good item to have, making SF a bit bulkier and ready to participate in early fights/pushes, especially with Wraith Bands and Wand (and Raindrops). However it does slightly delay other items like a Shadow Blade for early ganks.

• When going for the physical build I also find S&Y to be a strong item; unless there are specific things to dispel and I need Manta, S&Y is almost always in my item build at some point. It's another item that gives MS, but also Agi&AS for stronger right clicks as well as strength and status resistance to be extra bulkier. It allows SF to stay relevant as a right click carry (especially with Dragon Lance later on) and to stand his ground in fights.

• Thoughts about the SB/Deso build: SB isn't a bad item at all, it gives good right click boosts and can be a tool to move in/out of fights, especially as you mentioned in lower brackets it's easy to play around it and get free kills. However it can be countered by good supports and dust; it's a poor escape mechanism and while it's good to initiate people for fast kills, it can be kind of predictable so while you may get a few kills from it, it can be easy to run in a sentry and get baited/counter-initiated. (Especially if your supports don't care to sentry) I also feel like there are other heroes who do this kind of pick-off better (Slark/TA), and even the magic damages build with Blink/Euls can do it. On the other hand I love the stats and utility the other items I mentioned above give, so today I'm really mitigated about building SB as a first item. As for Deso I see it more as situational item than a main item. While I love Deso for the damages and to melt towers and squishy heroes, I rarely go for it unless I'm rolling on the enemy or really lack pushing power, because I feel so squishy with only SB and/or Deso.

• I often think of buying Aghanim's, but as a solely right click build it seems underwhelming when you could farm a butterfly or whatever instead. But the item is really interesting, especially since it can be consumed now, so maybe it's worth it ?

• Also, what about Solar Crest ? Similar to desolator it reduces the armor but also gives you stats and move speed (not to mention Medaillion is way cheaper and already applies the 7 armor debuff). It's not a big scary right click item but it does its job and since SF can fall off against stronger carries it's a good option imo since it can both cripple an enemy right clicker but also be used on allies to enhance them.

• Finally, what are your thoughts on Midas ? I've seen it sometimes and it can be a good item to stay relevant as a right click carry, especially if you have some heavy farmers on the enemy side. Obviously Midas being Midas means that it'll delay your other items, but I think SF can farm it easily by pushing (razing) the lane then stacking camps. Also it gives a good AS boost so really, once you have Treads, Midas and another item (eg S&Y) you're already scary and you'll keep on growing (faster items and talents).


   ● About the magic build :

• Talking about Midas, it does seem underwhelming if going for the magical build. Physical SF at least benefits from the AS, but you want to start dishing out the damages early as Magic-SF and you could spend these 2k golds on an eul's or veil so.. nah.

• Aaand since I mentioned Veil, what do you think of it ? I think of it like an Ember would go for it, the item gives good stats and armor to be bulkier + more mana, and the active makes for deadly Raze combos especially if you have other mates who can set them up for you (stun etc). I had good results with it, but then there's also the need for Eul's/Blink + wanting to upgrade your boots into travel, so it can be hard to fit it in your build. SF does farm waves quickly tho, so I think it can be ok to get it first and start rotating if you have someone who can stun, then work on Eul's/Travel?

• Also, while I love the idea of the magic damages build and while it seems to be the one most players go for now (in my experience), I often struggle to properly play it. (Mostly bad positioning so I can't pull off Raze combos and also tend to fall off later in the game in general)

• I don't think Octarine Core is a meme item at all, in fact it could be a very legit build but it would also be a very luxury item as first you'd want at least Hex on top of your other items (Blink/Eul's, probably BKB/Linken too, etc). I think most of the time you'd go E.Blade before Octarine, too, because you still need to dish out damages (or protect yourself from the big right clicker) and even with that much cooldown reduction (which you only get at lvl 25)  you're not a tinker who can focus on Parma hexing for instance , nor an alchemists that tanks with spell lifesteal. 

• I often end up playing as some kind of mixed-damages build rather than going purely one route or the other, with like Treads, Drum, but also picking the raze damages talent and going for Ags. I've also seen people going for both Eul's and SB. Maybe going for Yasha&Kaya for both right clicks and spell damage could be an option ? Also, Aghanim's Scepter could fit well in this build since it brings both extra soul damages and ult damages.

So yeah it ended up in a long ass comment again, oops. I really like to discuss itemization and even tho the hero seems to have troubles in this meta I think he'll always be a good midlaner . Again, talking about SF itemization and how you play him always seems so complex to me, so if anyone more experimented with the hero (like the acc-booster I has in my team last game lol) and can address these points it'd be really appreciated (especially the weird mixed build part lol)"

For real tho, it's crazy how a lot of women objectify gay men without realising the hypocrisy - that they treat us the same way they don't want to be treated by men. They're also often your basic, ""you go slay, girl!""-Twitter feminists who don't stop talking about how they're objectified by the evil Patriarchy™; but then again logic is a foreign concept to these people.

Men being objectified by women is not a gay-exclusive thing (eg. ""Girls, These 12 Hollywood Actors Bulges Will Make You Drool!"", and other articles by BuzzFeed and such), but they tend to act on it a lot with gay men because they don't view us as a ""threat"" unlike they do for straight men. 

Sadly I don't know of any article or resources about the subject, but if you're interested by this issue I'm sure you can find a lot of things online about women groping guys at gay bars, etc.
I'm sure you will find things notably on ""bachelorette parties"" (group of straight women going at gay bars, often with this behavior and treating dudes there like pets), and even in the gay community it's a somewhat controversial topic, with mostly everyone seeing them as bad but some people defending it because ""they feel safe there!"".(is sexually assaulting men a typical woman's behavior when she feels safe??)

I have a question though, most of the time I go Phase Boots for the brut damages boost + armor + being able to chase with the active and Stifling Dagger, but I've seen her being played with Treads. Would you recommend it? In what situation? I'm thinking Treads switching to strength can be useful for hp when dealing with magic damages and the AS is always good to proc more crits/farm faster, but it seems than most of the time she benefits more from Phase's bonuses (especially since Phantom Strike already gives attack speed when she wants to jump someone)."

Most of the time telling which hero is who isn't an issue if they're alone but with illusion heroes who are already confusing enough and that much cosmetics + particle effects + spell effects (looking at you, ES arcana), things can get really confusing in fights which is bad in Dota since quick decisions matter.


If this option is added, please, pleaaase Valve make it so that we can choose to display ONLY the icon next to the heroes' healthbar (or above them).

I don't play with nothing displayed because I need a quick way to tell to what hero which healthbar is associated, but I also don't care about other people's name... especially since I can already see their (sometimes long) names in chat and in the scoreboard and it'll take me 20 minutes to memorize and assimilate them to their hero,, only for it to change the next game.

Illusions would have the icon as well to not give away that they are illusions. You could maybe even choose which person do you want the icon next to (say if you have a PL against you and you think having too many icons would be confusing, then on the scoreboard you can toggle the option off for him and his illusions - but things already get confusing when there's a huge mass of illusions and the names are displayed as many times anyway);

Illusions of heroes that aren't yours should get the creator's icon imo. It would make sense as you'd clearly see the hero's model is not Shadow Demon's but see with the icon that they are his illusions. This wouldn't be an issue since you can already tell them apart if you play with ""player's name"" activated (this option displays the creator of the illusion's name, not the hero from which the illusion is created)



I think we should also have an option to show ONLY the icon, because with illusions/clones + cosmetics + particle effects + some spells, things can get confusing really fast and this is bad in a game where quick decisions matter; I don't need to also have a mass of ""PHANTOM LANCER"" text when I already see there's a mass of illusions in front of me."

Later on we lost Kiki but found another black kitty in the streets, my mom took him in and named him Ebène (literally ""ebony""). He was a sweetheart but he disappeared suddenly. Along the way we also raised a few rabbits, a mouse and a few hamsters (Mostly my sisters) though this was for a short time.

So yea I did deal with the loss of loved pets, honestly it's always hard to deal with and can be harder depending on the level of attachment/time spent together. Like, Daisy went through so much shit; he got kidnapped, some pieces of shit tried to burn him, and I think he also got ran over by a car. Not to mention the countless times he fell over the balcony lol. And he still survived! He was a real gem. One day he suddenly disappeared and we never saw him again, I literally grew up with this cat so I was so sad (I still miss him and am getting a bit teary-eyed rn). I like to think that since he was so old, he knew his time was coming and didn't want to make us sad. That's how I dealt with it at the time anyway.
We also lost Ebene when he was still only a few years old, and he was very loved by our family. I can't think of the moment we'll lose La Grosse, I love him even though people always laugh when they hear his name, at least it makes for a fun story/small chat lol.

I think you can tell a lot from someone based on how they treat/think of animals, and I can't picture myself with someone who wouldn't want them.
Also, I feel like growing up with pets had a lot of good influence on me, I guess it was always reassuring to have a calm cat around me. Especially when they were kitties (and I was a kid) so they were very playful, they were sweet little play partners. Also,I've always found that having them sleep/purr next to me/on me is a wonderful feeling;like they trust me and feel safe with me so I feel safe with them too. One of my main goal in life is to get a kitty/cat as soon as I'm in a larger place and actually have time/more money to take care of it.
Looking back, I didn't play or give as much attention to our dog than what I did with the cats (thankfully my brother and mother did), I do like him and he's a sweet dog but I guess I just got along more with the cats growing up. He's old now and cant imagine the sadness when he'll pass away (he recently got very sick), like I can't imagine my mother not having her daily walks with him, but I prefer not to think about it and enjoy it when I can be with him occasionally.
Really, when I try and think of my future there are a lot of doubts, the only thing I'm sure of is there is a cat in the picture, though I still occasionally picture myself with a dog if I try to look at my future with my bf (hopefully the same as I have now :)) because since he's so good with dogs I guess he'll know how to raise it and all better than me haha."

learndota2,etlm89r,t1_etkt1y1,1562940140.0,"Yea, but besides intentionally thrown games I mostly wanted to talk about games where you're just too far behind to come back with people not trying as hard as you are, because not everyone has the mindset to stay positive. That's what I wanted to point out, it'd be great if we all had this mindset but sometimes you're just with ppl who are not trying. 


I had a friend who was like that, he used to always encourage his mates, always had the ""don't give up"" in his chat wheel etc but with time and because he got too invested in the game with randoms, now he tilts 10 min into the game because he died twice and he can be toxic himself. That's a shame because he's a good friend and person but in game he can get so salty for nothing

I had something similar happen to me, when I was not having fun anymore during a bad lose streak, and it rang a bell in my head and I took a small break for the game. Now I'm enjoying the game like I used to and trying to encourage ppl etc even when we're behind, BUT I don't bother investing myself that much if I'm basically playing with bots who don't even communicate the slightest. 

Mostly this was my point in my previous comment, when I talked about taking a step back so you can come back fresh. Anyway I hope that makes sense; still I get you, and I agree that we should always try and make the best of a game"

learndota2,etjpsgy,t1_etibnvl,1562878745.0,"I think we should have a mixed/balanced approach on the subject, really

Tl;dr Good mindset and encouragements can only take you so far, there's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.

Obviously you should always try your best and there's almost always something to take from a game to improve yourself, yes even lost ones lol, unless you're a pro (even then..). It's also good to stay positive and always encourage your mates/point out things that could help rather than straight up blaming.

But while never giving up is the right thing to do in theory, in reality things can be different. I get the whole ""unless the game is over then it's still possible to win"" thing and it's a really good mindset to have in general but sometimes that just won't happen. I mean yea 0.001% chance to win IS ""still possible"" but that's not even 1 in 1000 games. And that is only on paper, without taking the human factor into account.(mindset/the fact that dota is a team game)
Yes sometimes the winning team can get carried away and make stupid mistakes but will they even be punished by the losing team that has already decided they lost?
When you have an afk, someone who sold his items, a 0/10/3 jungling Lc with 10 duel damages at 25min, or really just mates with a weak mental that have decided that because the game is hard they can't come back and proceed to play accordingly (dying in jungle, not showing up in fights, etc because they don't care), why invest so much time/energy when it's not reciprocated? Comebacks are real but they never happen when people don't want them to. You're only setting yourself up for disappointment/frustration by losing in 40min rather than 20, while you could rather be like ""okay there's no way we're winning this"" and chill. Obviously this doesn't mean you have to stop playing, but really just relax rather than tryharding when you're just running into a wall- at least you'll be fresh for your next game.


All in all, it's good to ""never give up"" (in Dota and in general) but it's also good to take a break and recognise that sometimes you can't make it because of things beyond your control(eg. Other players). Take a step back, and come back fresh.
That's what I think anyway, and I was really disappointed to see the whole ""urrrr you're saying that sometimes you can't win????, GROW A PAIR LOL!11!1"" by people totally ignoring the point made by others, as if they never played with someone who straight up ruins the game by selling his items and staying afk/feeding/whatever."
learndota2,etcmeyj,t1_etcexey,1562688031.0,"I'll add Lion to your list, he's is a good pos5 hero who can easily make things happen with his abilities and proper positioning; he only really needs a Wand&Tranquil (similar to KotL or CM who don't need Arcane) and since he can snowball  with Finger of Death kills he can also work on bigger items eg. Aether Lens, Blink etc. Also I think a lot of people underate his GpM talent.

Also mentioning Ogre Magi because even if he's a great pos4 I think you can also make him work as a good pos5. Since he has so high base hp, hp regen, armor and a good right click he can trade and zone the offlaner easily (similar to how he bullies the carry when he's on the offlane). The hero has always been a bit greedy and is now even more since they added the multicast Midas, but he also gets the job done with just Arcane + typical support items.

Obviously ""it's not /all/ women, just some of them!"" yet it's ok to act the other way around.

I'm a huge Rubick spammer (more than 500 games on my account and around 300 on my old) so I can definitely give some advice here. Hope this helps :D

&#x200B;

* Skill build:

You want to max Fade Bolt since it's your main source of damages with a rather short cd (up to 10s). Abuse it when trading with the offlaner since it nukes well and reduces their damages (be careful tho it pushes the lane). Telekinesis is a great stun later in the game but early on it's quite weak (34 sec cd level 1 for a 0.8 stun on the main target). It's good to set up kills tho, so you want like 1 point in it. Invest a second point in it if you want a slightly longer range/stun duration and shorter cd but your passive has higher priority. Because you won't generally be able to use Telekinesis more than once per fight (unless it's maxed, then maybe twice), skilling it more is not as interesting as skilling the passive. Because the passive amplifies debuffs, it will also increase Telekinesis' duration anyway + it will work for the spells you steal so it's better to skill it. It also works for your items ! (eg. Atos/Hex) It's what makes your spells so strong and disables so long.

About your ult, you need a bit of game knowledge to know who does what and especially to know how fights will unfold. (eg. don't stay too close if they have a big initiator so you can counter-init) Try to always have a stolen spell on you so when a fight starts you already have a stolen spell ready, can cast it and then steal another. Be aware of what spells were used (eg. if you wanted Fissure and ES used it and then used Totem, don't wait 15 seconds for another Fissure to come; instead aim for another spell). Most of the time you want controls or nukes (if there's a Sven you want his stun not his other spells) though sometimes there are some ""niche"" spells that can be useful, too (eg. Oracle's disarm can fuck up a LC or Void when they don't have BKB, Dazzle's Grave can save your mates etc). Obviously you can wait for the big teamfight ultimate to make *the play ™* but don't sit around doing nothing while there are other good spells flying around.

Basically in fights your role is to try and disrupt the fight as much as possible; counter-init if they have big initiators, lock down someone with long stuns, spam your long-range nuke to dish damages and ~~steal~~ secure kills with it (lol), bring someone to your team with Telekinesis (or push them back if you're running away), etc.

About your talents : Rubick has a decent auto-attack so +60 damages can be a good idea, tho you're much more useful with your spells than with your right-clicks (unlike you're playing mid) so go for the HP talent if you feel you're too squishy. Then, both Lv15 talents are good though I'd advise you to go for the cast range most of the time since it's so good for Rubick. At level20, go for the Fade Bolt cd talent if you want to nuke more (most of the time I go for it) but Telekinesis Land range (the sub-spell that moves the enemy after you used Telekinesis) can be interesting if you want to catch/isolate someone. At lv25, unlike you're frequently stealing huge nukes like Laguna Blade/Finger of Death/etc I'd say go for Telekinesis CD 99% of the time because it's seriously so good to have such a strong stun every 7 seconds rather than 22(!).

&#x200B;

* Itemization:

Early on and until you have good mana regen with your items, bring a lot of clarities so you don't run out of mana and can abuse Fade Bolt. Both Arcane and Tranquil are good boots for Rubick, my favorite are Tranquil + clarities because they let you move around much faster/keep your HP high so you can make things happen and start working on your other items faster whereas Arcane are more expensive so are longer to get. Magic Stick/Wand are almost a must since they're so good to survive and have mana in a pinch. Urn is a good item that makes you a bit bulkier + small stats and mana regen boost, get it if you want to support your team with heals and/or are rotating a lot. If you're too squishy you can also go for a Bracer + raindrops. Ideally, you want a Blink or/and a Force Staff because mobility is what makes you survive and properly use some spells + it allows you to initiate/counter-initiate fights. Don't rush Blink if you're not having a good games are there are tons of items that work just as well, it's just that Blink is very appreciated. Eul's Scepter is great because it makes you move faster + provides very appreciated mana regen and a new ability to isolate enemies. Also, Aether Lens is really good on the hero especially when you get Lv15's range. Then you have the standard supports items like Glimmer, Ghost Scepter against physical carries, get a tome of knowledge if you're behind, and Aghanim is really good on him but expensive. I see a lot of Rubick rushing it and then not buying wards for a while or really they just have arcane (sometimes a rushed Blink, too) and spend 20 min working on Ags, and imo it's really bad when you could be getting cheaper and most useful items that would help your team. Especially since most of the time you won't have the mana to be stealing spells every 2 sec.

Situational items involve midas if you're greedy (lol), Drum for the stats + move speed (usually if it's needed then the offlaner buys it), Spirit Vessel if you went Urn, Atos for the stats and if you need to hold down someone. Mentioning Hex even if it's so expensive, as nearly all intelligence supports(or really most supports in general) benefit from it tho it's a luxuary item but worth it if you can afford it. It's also amplified by your passive so it can make you win games by locking down a key enemy."
learndota2,estroqg,t1_essokhf,1562272480.0,"You're welcome :)

&#x200B;

You'll find tons of guides on youtube that will cover the basics; thankfully you're familiar with the Moba genre since you're from LoL so really once you're familiar with the mechanics (like denying, stacking camps, rune timing etc) and have a decent pool of heroes you're comfortable playing you can start looking at advanced guides, how people at higher brackets play the heroes you play, etc."
learndota2,esqxgb9,t3_c8qyiz,1562211888.0,"Hey ! First of all welcome lol.

Right now I think you should stay away from the carrying as people expect a lot from carries and a lot of them start really weak so if you don't know how some things work you're gonna get destroyed. I remember trying to introduce one of my friends to the game after he left LoL but since there are so many mechanics that are not explained by the in-game tutorial and there can be so much going on in fights, he didn't understand a thing and eventually left the game.

&#x200B;

Roles are pretty flexible in Dota and in general we talk more about ""positions"", referring to who has the priority to farm. Heroes in the team are classed from pos1 to pos5, with the pos1 being the carry, pos2 being mid, etc all the way to pos5 who's the support.

I've read in the comments that you used to play top and jungle, as someone else answered jungle is basically non-existent and yea it's more the place you go in between waves of creeps. Some supports can also decently take down small to medium jungle camps to get a bit of gold and work towards key items without taking farm away from their carry.

I'd suggest starting with pos3, maybe support(pos5). Not mid(pos2) since you mentioned you weren't a fan of outplaying ppl in 1v1.

* Pos3 is what comes close to the top role in LoL. They are often utility/teamfighting heroes or tanks who are expected to lane solo (unless they're helped by the pos4) against two (the support and carry) or three (the carry, pos5 and pos4) heroes. Because of this they're either tanky heroes or heroes with one or multiple escape mechanism (eg. windranger has a spell that makes her run faster and avoid physical attacks, centaur warunner has a lot of hp and a passive that reflects damages, etc) and you have a wide variety of them, to your typical melee tank with a stun to the squishy but elusive archer, as well as heroes who can create smaller units to hold their lane and harass the enemy carry, etc. I think this is the role you'd enjoy the more, since it's comparable to the Top role in LoL and since you have so many different heroes to choose from. Your role is to try and disrupt the enemy carry's farm as much as you can (by harrassing them and denying your creeps (killing them when they're below 50% hp gives less xp to the enemy) while also getting as much as you can for yourself. Even if you had a hard lane (some match ups are straight up impossible haha), when teamfights start to happen you can join in and impact them with a large AoE stun (eg. Tidehunter is a tanky utility hero whose ultimate is a big teamfight stun), stealing the carry's damage, or really just bringing heals, armor, auras or whatever to your team. The huge con obviously is having to deal with two heroes alone most of the time.

&#x200B;

* Support (Pos5) : Even tho you used to play Top/jungle in LoL, you could try supporting. Since supports are designed to be able to do what they do even if they're behind in terms of xp or items, and since at lower brackets you'd just be expected to ward the map and stun/whatever to get the job done, you could start learning the game by supporting. That way even if you ""screw up"" (say if you're not having a good game) you can still be useful and watch and learn. I'm suggesting this because it's what I did when I started, I felt like there was a lot less pressure on me and I could better familiarize myself with the game. But if it's not your thing don't force yourself, especially since being behind as a support is not the most fun thing to experience. 

&#x200B;

* I'll quickly mention pos4 (roamers/""semi-supports""); basically roamers are people who are constantly moving around to apply pressure, try to get kills/zone the enemy out of their lane, ward the map up, support the pos3 if they're having too much trouble, etc. They're like a 2nd support that try to make others win their lanes and can contribute with their abilities. It can be a really fun role for you to try since you're not the ""hard"" support, you're kinda in-between. I'd suggest experimenting once you're a bit experienced tho because if you don't know what you're doing it just looks like you're walking around achieving nothing.

&#x200B;

As for heroes suggestions, here are a few :

* Supports (pos5) :
* Lion, pretty straightforward ranged support with a stun, a hard disable, a mana-drain and a huge burst/nuke.
* Ogre Magi, a melee support who's quite tanky, great at zoning the enemy pos3 and with a good set of abilities.
* Bane, a ranged support who brings a lot of disables and damages to the table.

&#x200B;

* Offlaners (pos3) :
* Windranger, a ranged, elusive hero with stun, a damaging skillshot, an evasion spell and an ultimate that makes her attack a single enemy at (nearly) full attack speed. She's one of my favorite hero to play and while there's tons of room for skilled plays, she's not *that* hard to learn. She's very versatile in her item build, can quickly burst down a foe while also bringing some utility.
* Mars, a melee, tanky hero who has a passive that reduces right click damages coming at his face up to 70%, a stun and a small AoE damaging spell. He has a good teamfight ultimate that can also be used 1-on-1 with a relatively small cooldown. All around he's balanced and brings good utility to the team while also being able to stand his own ground.
* Tidehunter is similar to mars, tanky/utility hero with a good teamfight ultimate.

&#x200B;

There are tons of others but these are a few that come at the top of my mind. They're not too hard to learn, especially the support ones, again the main difficulty with the offlaners being that you're expected to stand your ground alone. That being said I think offlaner is what comes closer to toplane in LoL and since there are many different heroes who suit that role there HAS to be something you like lol.

Anyway I must just add that the game has a lot of mechanics that seem tricky at first (for instance my friend kept dying because of Bloodseeker's ultimate, which deals damages if you move, without noticing it) and a lot of people can be toxic. Even for me, I remember my first hours on the game and I didn't understand a thing, luckily I had some friends on the game and we played together (looking back I did some really noob things lol). I suggest you try different things, find what you like and most importantly have fun!"
learndota2,esqmlaf,t1_esqmjz2,1562205513.0,"I had to cut this in two since it was too long lol, here's part 2:

&#x200B;

* Itemization :
* It may not seem like it but, if you have decent reflexes, Manta is a great item agaisnt her ! It disjoints projectiles upon activation : use it when she tries to land her stun on you. With a bit of practice and playing against her, you'll be able to dodge it (it's kind of predictable). Also, get a fast MKB to deal with the evasion. Not necessarily first item (it sucks) but, say, after Manta or BKB. I think it'll really help more than Butterfly against her. (Especially since WR often goes for MKB too so she'll eventually ignore the evasion from Butterfly). Hurricane Pike is a good item to deal with Windranger, and it's the extension of Dragon Lance (which Luna also usually goes for). When you use it on an enemy it will push both of you away from the other so you can get a good escape mechanism from it. It works well when you have MKB, too, so you can safely attack her from afar even when Windrun is on.
* Aghanim's Scepter can be a good idea, but don't rush it (have one or two big items like Manta and BKB first). Overall a situational item for Luna.
* Trading a slot that could be used for damages (like Butterfly) for a Linken's Sphere can be a good idea to prevent her stun or ultimate.
* Most certainly do NOT go for Blademail. As someone else commented earlier, yes Luna farms fast and Blademail is a \~2k item but those 2k could be spent way better (\~2k2 is Yasha, \~2k2 is an Ultimate Orb, \~2k2 is half a BKB..) She farms fast BECAUSE she doesn't go Blademail; the only stats she'd like from Blademail is the damages and maybe the armor, while she lacks the HP pool to make use of it. You're not a Dark Seer, Axe, Bristleback, Legion Commander,etc who wants to/can take a lot of hits. (at leats not until 40 min into the game when you have big tanky items like Satanic or Skadi)
* Ask your supports to go for Ghost Scepter (prevents them from dying to the ult), Glimmer Cape, Eul's Scepter (can purge Windrun).
* If you have a utility hero (someone like a Tusk pos4 or a tanky offlaner), Lotus Orb can be a good idea.

&#x200B;

* Good allies against Windranger/suggestions for other carries :
* Supports with long disables to waste/prevent Windrun and lock her down and/or supports with one or multiple strong nukes : Shadow Shaman and Lion have good stuns and a built-in hex, plus a good nuke, Ogre Magi with his deadly multi-cast stuns (and slows), Treant Protector and his huge AoE ultimate, Lina who usually goes Eul's Scepter and her stun/ultimate, Oracle and his Q that applies a long root and purges the target, Bane (his ultimate and Nightmare both keep her in place)... Also mentioning Silencer and Skywrath Mage since they can silence her before she uses her spells (and Skywrath has huge magic damages).
* Alternatively, supports who can keep you alive when she's jumping you : Dazzle (immortality + heals, also great harasser on the lane), Oracle (can disarm her or cast his ultimate on you), Bane (can cast Nightmare on you or her so she can't attack you)...
* Midlaners with built-in disables and/or with strong nukes : Puck (his silence prevents her from using Windrun and his ultimate keeps her leashed), Lina (same reasons as above), OD (can cage Windranger during Windrun and often goes for Rod of Atos)... Also mentioning Kunkka because X Marks the Spot ensures Windranger doesn't run away (plus, he has Torrent which is a decent stun). Or Midlaners who go for disabling items (eg. Viper and Rod of Atos, Queen of Pain and Orchid, etc)
* Some offlaners : Axe, since he usually goes BM and can force her to attack him for up to 3.2 sec, LC can lock her and usually goes BM too, SK has a good stun and magic damages, Mars can trap her in his ult, has decent damages and is tanky enough to go BM, Timbersaw can also tank her and go BM + he has good magic/pure damages, Centaur and his stun+Return+his ult which can be used to chase her, Underlord has decent magic damages with his Q, can trap her with his W, is tanky enough to go Blademail and can deal with her split-push with his ult, Razor can steal her damages + has decent spell damages with his Q and ult. Mentioning Kunkka again since he can be played on the offlane.
* As I said above, Windranger can bully Luna easely in the earlier stages of the game (and even later on if you're not careful) so it's easy to have a bad game against her, especially if she snowballs, so here are a few carries that can deal with her more easely.

1. Phantom Lancer : He creates tons of illusions that Windranger cannot effectively clean, even with Maelstrom. Her main damages mostly come from her ult, so if she targets the wrong illusion, her ult goes to waste. If she targets the real you, you can use your W and she has to find the right one again. Also, PL has a slow with his Q and he usually goes for Diffusal which also slows, so he can kinda deal with Wind running away.
2. Chaos Knight : Kinda like PL, he has a lot of illusions in teamfights with his ultimate. He also has a stun (up to 4 seconds!) and his W to deal with her running away.
3. Slark : Pounce can hold Windranger for quite a long time so her running away is not a concern if you manage to land it. His ult also ensures you can safely hit her without fear of being stunned/targeted by her ult. Plus, since it can be used to detect wards, you know where you're safe or not.
4. F.Void : He's great against her! Yes he suffers during the laning stage if he's against her because she's a ranged hero, but as soon as he gets his ult he can basically ensure a free kill on her. Time Walk is also good against her since it can be used to escape and/or regen lost HP from a Powershot or her ultimate.

&#x200B;

Here it is, it's already quite long and I can't think of anything else right now. Feel free to ask anything, hope this helps !"

I used to spam Windranger to gain MMR on my brother's account when I didn't have a computer lol, and even now Windranger is one of my favorite heroes to play. She's really strong in this patch, not OP or impossible to deal with but like, REALLY strong. So strong that even I find myself banning her because she can be so annoying to deal with.

She's evasive, can jump on you really fast and then burst you down with her ult. Even when she's not played mid but rather utility-like, she can bring a lot of damages to the table. She can snowball fast and be a pain in the ass to deal with if you don't coordinate with your team : if you ignore her she'll split push or bully isolated targets, and if you give her too much attention she can create a lot of space while still running away from you.

Here are some general advices as well as some more specific ones :

&#x200B;

* On the lane :
* WR relies on Windrun (E) to trade and harass you/your support. However it's also usually the spell you max last when you play Windranger (Powershot and Shackleshot have greater priority while 1 point in Windrun is usually enough to escape/survive in lane), and obviously it doesn't protect her from spells. At level 1, it lasts 3 seconds and have a 15 seconds CD, so that's 12 seconds in-between each Windrun. Pay attention to this and try to abuse it if she's against you on the offlane : harass her when you can, use Lucent Beam on her (bring clarities so you don't run out of mana); the goal is to force her to use it so you know you can either farm the wave safely for 12 seconds or get a kill if she's not careful. (At lower brackets people don't adjust their builds, and if she does end up spending points in it, that means she gets her stronger spells later :D) Ask your support to help you, too : generally Windranger trades well but again she's weak to spells. Heroes like Ogre Magi with good HP/Hp regen and good spells are great to zone her out. Treant also comes to mind. CM is good to lock her with Frostbite and give you mana regen but she's really frail and slow so Wind can get a kill on her if you're not careful. Shadow Shaman has really good disables, too.
* You should feel safer and more confident when you get your level 6. As you already know Eclipse is really great against her (so long as she doesn't have BKB/Windrun Invisibility talent). If for instance she tries to dive you alone with Windrun, pop it at once (be sure to have enough vision so she doesn't hide in trees and waste your ult). You can also coordinate with your support to snatch a kill on her (say, try to bait her into trading; when she pops Windrun you and your support stun her and you pop Eclipse). Obviously be carefuly with the creeps lol.
* Be careful with her Powershots ! It's one of her main way to weaken her foes to try and snatch an early kill. Most of the time when you're a Windranger player and against a carry with a small to medium HP pool like Luna you'll try to get kills with it. She will probably bring clarities to the lane to keep spamming it; try to pop them with Lucent Beam. If you see her charging her bow when you're trading blows that means she'll pop it (it charges in 1 second). Step aside ! If you're running away from her and she hasn't used it yet, she'll probably try to snipe you : again, step aside ! If she's well in her lane (like close to full HP/mana) and she suddenly disappears for 5-10 seconds she'll probably be trying to snipe you from the trees so be cautious. Having a well placed Ward really helps with this.
* Other than that, if you do end up losing your lane (WR can bully Luna early), don't panick and keep farming. Obviously don't spend 35 min in jungle but try to get one or two key items (say MoM and Yasha for instance) rather than joining fights, get a kill and die. This is a remark that stands true for every/most carries but especially Luna : you have to know when to farm and when to show up (the more you'll play/watch guides the more you'll know to identify the dynamics of the game). Luna farms pretty fast tho, so you should be able to get decent farm even if you had a bad lane. Also, watch guides on how to farm with efficiency, stacks, etc, it really helps. Ask your supports to help by stacking jungle/ancient camps. Also, supports don't always know where you want to farm/if you suddenly decide to push because a lane is abandoned etc; or they don't always have time to be running around wardind bot while the rest of the team is fighting top, etc. Sometimes it can be better to buy an Observer Ward yourself since it's so cheap now and put it where you know you'll be farming for the next 5 min. Also, farming the lane usually gives you more gold than the jungle, AND it pushes the lane so it's doing something useful for your team! Against Windranger, tho, be sure to ward ahead of you so you know you won't get jumped at.

* After the laning stage :
* WR relies on her E to survive and be elusive but otherwise she's rather squishy and easy to burst down. Again, try to coordinate with your team to kill her. Your best bet against it is to lock her down either before she uses it (and kill her fast) or when she has the buff on to waste it. Coordinate your stuns to lock her longer ! Eg. Lucent Beam doesn't last long but has a good range. It can be useful to use it first so if you have an ally with a longer stun but shorter range, they can get closer and use it (eg. Rubick).
* If she's snowballing and the game is hard, try to not be alone too far where it's not warded. She gets quick solo kills so easely it's basically asking to be killed.
* Luna goes for Manta 99.99% of the time and it's really good if you want to push a lane but are afraid to show up. Push the lane a bit yourself, then send your illusions on the next creep waves so meanwhile you can farm the nearby jungle rather safely. You can also try and bait her by sending only one illusion to make her believe it's the real you. Either way, when it's not safe to go alone, send your illusions, even if it means getting a bit less gold/pushing a bit less far.
* Please, when (if) she gets the Windrun Invisibility talent, be sure to carry Dust (even when you're pos1, most of the time you can make some room if you put a Wraith Band or Magic Wand in your backpack). Obviously your supports should carry some and use Sentry Wards near the areas you want to push/fight for but if they don't, buy if for yourself. Seriously it's so cheap, I die a little inside everytime my team doesn't bring Dust and complains about dealing with an invisible hero.
* Windranger is really good at making space mainly because she can split push so fast with Powershot + a few right clicks to clear waves, then use her ult on towers and run away when someone TPs for her. If you want to stop her, it's best to wait for her to go a little deep. Don't TP where she can see you (eg if she's pushing Radiant bot T2, TP on the Shrine not on the tower, so you can catch her from behind), or use a smoke with an ally or two and you can get an easy kill on her.
* Sometimes it can be best to let her get a tower if it means you're packed with your team and win a fight + get a tower yourself."
