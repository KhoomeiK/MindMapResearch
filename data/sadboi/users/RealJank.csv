I would focus on, that you have a doctor that prescribes you meds with a degree to back it up.

Also if you think the meds really don't help, you might want to ask about your diagnosis, misdiagnosises happen, maybe you have a thyroid issue or something.

Not sure what else to says. Do not stop meds without doctor supervision."

schizoaffective,f93r2hc,t3_e3kvl2,1575066273.0,They're all delusional perhaps. Or there's a grain of truth in that we are actually experiencing the same universe with physical laws that has been interpretatied before in numerous ways. There is still something unknown and awe inspiring at the core that is driving us to seek an understanding of of our own interpretations. I think it's the introspection where the issue stems. It seems like a matter of reaching a point of introspection where the interpretation of consensus reality is esoteric and non-Newtonian.

Tapering with professional guidance and therapy can help get to the root of symptoms that might be masked if you really want to get off meds, what's ""worked"" for me is tapering to a mildly symptomatic level and working through it in therapy.

Also biological deficiencies probably have to be addressed. If a mutation is present that's changing brain chemistry.

schizoaffective,f48hb4l,t3_djrqof,1571439239.0,"Here's what I think. Delusions are misunderstandings with grains of truth at their core. Reality is bleak and depressing in truth and my ability to change that is minut at best. The system in place is using psychosis to treat the general populations malcontent with reality while simultaneously negating their efforts to change it. The self is globalizing and rejecting it's possible avenues of empathy because of cultural and locational divides which in turn leads to nationalist movements spurting up everywhere. The globe is priming for a world war on a scale never before imagined. Through global communication the conflicting ideological view points of the human population are converging in the minds of individuals with results being indistinguishable points of origin of internal conflicts hidden by lack of knowledge of the actual ideological teachings held by participants in the global dialogue, a kind of subterfuge. The only answer is more knowledge of the conflicts of the population however there are impedances to that end from agents that wish to see their respective coalitions achieve the leading roles in the present dialogue taking place. The biological machines of old are driving a ever more increasing tension between each other for the sake of genetic diversity as means of assuring survival of the human race in instances of genetic population vulnerabilities; an evolved means of maintaining the process of evolution. The bleakness and depression is that of consequences not of consciousness, it is that of biology on levels practically imperceivable within social interaction an unconscious ebb and flow of the system in which we inhabit."

It's all a business of self interest. The important thing to remember is that it's been this way forever and that the systems in place have formed over thousands of years in an effort to live peacefully among each other.
