latebloomerlesbians,fr5q7el,t1_fr5fupb,1589912814.0,"I do think it’s common for people to feel like the therapist favors their spouse.. now.. you could be right and she could be taking your husbands side more. And yea, that’s probably true since what benefits him is more likely to preserve the relationship. 

What if you brought that up to her? Said you feel like she’s favoring him? Or not hearing your needs?"
latebloomerlesbians,fr5ck02,t3_gmr77m,1589906313.0,I feel like it’s a red flag if any therapist tells you what to do. They should be providing light suggestions and asking how you feel about it. But keep in mind.. this therapists job is to treat you as a couple.. not as the individual. So she is not looking out for your interests.. she is looking out for the interests as a couple

TwoXSex,fr1zk64,t1_fr1yoxu,1589828607.0,"I agree with everything you’re saying. I more take issue with men who only bring up male circumcision when people talk about FGM. That tells me they don’t actually care about male circumcision..they just don’t like women. I know that’s not you are doing though and not what the OP was doing. It’s just- I do see that behavior from men. 

I also thank you for taking the time to explain things thoroughly with me.. and engage in respectful discourse. Even though it is an emotionally loaded topic. You explained it in a way that I was able to hear.. and I am appreciative. You’ve actually managed to change my view largely"
TwoXSex,fr1b91e,t1_fr080sz,1589816671.0,I can legitimately say this has gotten me to reevaluate things. This doesn’t take away from me critique of the way the OP handled it though.. and doesn’t change my view that it is important for women to have a voice on women’s issues. Oftentimes those voices are dismissed under “well it happens to men.. so why are you complaining”. And that’s the thing. Injustice is injustice.. we should be fighting against all injustice towards all people.. men and women all included. We shouldn’t just be concerned with injustice when the opposite sex raises an issue of injustice for themselves. And we shouldn’t silence it.
TwoXSex,fr06caz,t1_fr05v7v,1589785092.0,No that’s what I was saying. Hm I guess I could be wrong about that and am open to being corrected. From what I know of FGM it is often removal of the clitoris which is the source of female pleasure. Wouldn’t that be the same as removal of the penis? Not just the forskin? Also every circumcized man I know orgasms regularly- every time they have had sex with me. Whereas.. I don’t. And my genitals are intact. Anyway- it just doesn’t seem like the same thing to me. But forgive my ignorance.. like I said.. I’m open to being wrong
TwoXSex,fr0543a,t1_fr04jdm,1589784025.0,What? I don’t understand.. why are you arguing with me? I’m against circumcision for both genders..

I’m trying to explain the reasoning behind those women in the post.. and how there is a TIME AND PLACE for talking about those things. I guess what you want is for me to say- yea you’re right, no one on earth has suffered more than men. Sorry for existing. 

And yea- If we are in a thread talking about FGM it would be pretty fucked up for some women to complain about the price of tampons. It’s not the same at all. There is a time and place for that

TwoXSex,fqzwlfj,t1_fqzswjt,1589777205.0,"And you’re missing the point.. it’s not about us giving you permission to speak. It’s about you having the empathy. If you had empathy for women you’d understand the importance of lifting up certain issues. It isn’t that I want it to be  more about women..it’s that it’s important to highlight the difference between the treatment. It’s important for men to not OVERSHADOW women’s issues. Just as if we are talking about men’s issues women shouldn’t OVERSHADOW that. Do you really not see the difference? You are the one that wants control of the narrative. 

You somehow notice only the parts of what I’m saying which you can twist in the most negative way possible. It’s as if you have a narrative in your head that all women and all feminists HATE men and only care about themselves. You’ve decided that’s true so you only notice what makes that true."
TwoXSex,fqzrpec,t1_fqzqkv9,1589773797.0,"You don’t look fat in that video. You look good. You’re a good looking dude. 

I disagree that our movements should be separate. The world would be a much better place if people spoke for each other-not just their own identities. I detest it when feminist groups dismiss very real issues plaguing men.. to me that’s not feminism.. that’s misandry and it’s hurting our cause. 

Empathy matters. In fact- empathy is the most important thing IMO.  We should all be mindful and caring of others issues. I think you were missing the point of what I was trying to say. I’m trying to explain the reason behind those women’s mindsets and the post. It’s wrong to be dismissive of the very real pain and immorality that is male circumcision.  But most of these women weren’t talking about that. They were advocating for their right to have women’s issues be at the forefront without men saying.. “well what about X”. The reason for that is when you say “what about x” you are dismissing the very real pain of whatever issue it is. 

I am sad for the fact that I don’t think you really grasp the real pain that comes along inherent to being a woman. It’s not a competition.. yet, it is important to highlight specifically female issues because violence against women at the hands of men is just vastly more prevalent than the reverse. And the motivation behind female genital mutilation is specifically geared towards the disenfranchisement of women. That’s why the people women in the post were so frustrated. They want to be able to center women’s issues and not have it overshadowed by men’s issues. Because for far too long- women’s issues have been seen as unimportant and our voices silenced. 

I don’t expect to change your mind through this post- that would be wishful thinking. But I want you to know that I DO care about your pain. I DO think you being circumsized was awful- every bit as awful as if it happened to a woman. But I also DON’T believe the issue of FGM is largely comparable to male circumcision. That point is mostly moot though. If you were run over by a truck and on life support I doubt you’d respond well to me saying “well-what about all the people who died? Don’t you feel worse for them? Get over it! It’s just a coma” I can’t expect you to empathize with people who have it worse when you’re in so great of pain. I just want to explain the situation to you as best as I can so you don’t hate women. Or think we all hate men. Or think our intentions are bad. I just want you to understand where we are coming from."

I mean like - did you even read my original comment?
TwoXSex,fqzmaqu,t1_fqzkwun,1589770353.0,I have a question.. how much energy do you spend dedicated to advocating for women’s issues?

TwoXSex,fqzdi8h,t1_fqzcsfj,1589765090.0,How do YOU know where the scale goes? Regardless.. you’re missing the point. Female and male circumcision is not the same. End of story. You’re also willfully missing the parts in my post where I said male circumsicion is immoral and wrong.
TwoXSex,fqzc009,t1_fqzb9g2,1589764191.0,"Alright. Fine.

I mean I’m basing those comments off of male partners I have had. Most of my male partners (6 out of 7) have been circumsized. I also have male friends who are circumsized. Are they all lying to me? I never said how YOU feel.. I’m saying how many circumcized men feel."
TwoXSex,fqzaa7v,t3_glr5dd,1589763171.0,My hands would get tingly too/go numb.. not the rest of the side effects though. I assume it’s from blood rushing to that part of the body
TwoXSex,fqz8uqg,t3_glqm8b,1589762310.0,"First- I’m very sorry that circumcision has affected you in such a terrible way. I agree make cicumsicion is immoral and a violation of individual rights. And I’m sorry it has affected your ability to feel sensations. That’s awful. And I’m sorry for the pain this post caused you.. that’s also real and I’m very sorry. 

I think it’s important to explain a few things. 1. In general, males that are circumcised are still able to feel intense pleasure and have orgasms. Their penises are still functioning and they are still able to enjoy sex. It is possible that the feelings aren’t as intense as those who haven’t been circumcised.. but different studies hVs shown different things. That doesn’t change the fact that there are botched circumcisions that ruin lives.. and even men have lost their penises or at least complete functionality and sensation. But in the vast majority of cases - this is not true. 

It is also important to describe the motivation between the two. Male circumcision is motivated by religion, a covenant with god.. and also for cleanliness reasons (uncircumcised penises are harder to clean and have higher rates of stds) female circumcision is motivated to keep women chaste, to destroy their sensation and sexual feelings, to keep them disempowered. Their genitals are mutilated (just as circumcised males are) but they also cannot feel any pleasure at all. That has been completely taken from them. Sometimes their vaginas are sewn shut. There is no reason for it other than to control women 

Lastly.. thr is thread was talking about “whataboutism”. It’s similar to if a black person made a pat about the disenfranchisement of their people and a while person were to say “yea well one time I was bullied for being white”. You can’t compare the systematic issues black people and people of color have had to face in this world.. just like you can’t compare the struggles men have had to face to the systematic disenfranchisement of women. Similarly, imagine if a straight person said to a gay person “my life sucks because someone called me a “breeder” and it really hurt my feelings” sure- your feelings are valid but read the room. A minor insult when you’re in the privelaged class isn’t going to carry a lot of weight amoung people who have been murdered throughout history just for loving who they love. 

There are lots of issues than effect men specifically in terrible ways. Men are more likely to commit suicide, men are abused, men are raped, men are mutilated.. male abuse victims are less likely to be taken seriously.. these things are awful and immoral and terrible. And being upset about these things is absolutely valid. It’s immoral when women body shame men, it’s immoral to circumcise men, it’s immoral to abuse men, but youre not reading the room. Men have held to power for Millenia. The abuse, rape, terror, murder, and even milder things like rude comments and minor sexism, etc they have inflicted on women just does not compare to what women as a whole have done to men. Just like male circumcision  does not compare to female circumcision. You do deserve sympathy., but women also deserve to have their pain held and regarded and not overshadowed by yours. Bring this up independent of women’s issues."
TwoXSex,fqz5ppc,t3_glnha6,1589760427.0,I’m not straight- I’m bi- but I do generally prefer lesbian porn. And there was a period of time where I mostly just got off to lesbian fantasies. But it still was always possible for me to get off to straight fantasies. I’d also often fantasize about two gay men going at it. If you can ONLY get off to lesbian fantasies.. I would wonder about that. Is there a reason you think you are straight? How is your attraction to men?

bisexual,fqfjskj,t1_fqffqio,1589326168.0,Oh for sure- I see what you mean. I think I felt the way you did at first when I was just coming to terms with being bi. I felt like every woman around me that was “bi” greatly preferred men. But now that I’m in a LTR with a man.. and seek out more queer representation on youtube.. and whatnot.. I find it difficult to find people that I can relate to. Mainly I might be feeling this because a lot of bi women I looked up to came out as lesbians.. the latest being Alayna Joy.

There’s nothing inherently unhealthy about identifying as cis, pan, Or non-binary. And if you have two X chromosomes.. it’s just factually accurate to say you were probably AFAB

Edit to add:
Heterosexism is sorta founded on this idea that our realities and perception of ourselves isn’t “grounded” and isn’t valid or true. That’s why so many women don’t know they are attracted to women until very late in life. We really shouldn’t be saying anyone’s way of defining themselves isn’t grounded in reality."
latebloomerlesbians,fqbkvop,t3_ghxxxt,1589238887.0,"Yea I might not be the best person to answer this.. because I ask myself similar questions. But here is what I’ve experienced which I know counts as attraction to men. 

I can say I have looked at guys and thought “wow.. I want to see you naked”

I have lost myself in the moment having sex with guys 

I have been turned on giving blowjobs 

I have had orgasms from men.. and it was from the experience of the intimacy and arousal from the situation + him.. not me “closing my eyes and thinking of England”

I have had sexual fantasies about men since I hit puberty. 

When I was in high school I would google “men ejaculating” because it turned me on so much 

I have desired seeing men I’m crushing on shirtless

I have wanted to touch/kiss/get close to/make out with every man I’ve had a crush on  

I enjoy looking at some men- and find them very pretty to look at 

When I was in high school I loved looking at the Calvin Klein underwear models(men)...now it’s sorta reversed.. I like looking at scantily clad women more but I honestly think it has to do with what I’m “getting” at the times. But yea I would stare at the male underwear models and actively seek it out 

When I’ve been single(which I haven’t been really in 8 years)  I have “craved” penis. Sometimes so much that it actually hurts to fantasize about men because I’m so upset I don’t have it. I fantasized about women during this time too and I think the reason it might not have been as intense a feeling of loss was comp het. Even now, maybe once a month, sometimes twice, I will have a very intense craving for penis where it is basically a NEED. Ill think “I need my partner.. NOW”

I have for sure been in love with men. Not loving/friendship.. in deep romantic love. Where I think of them all the time, their happiness feels more important than mine, I want to be intimate and close, I want to express my love through sex, I want to be with them forever, time with them is even better than my alone time, I find their flaws cute, I crave them, getting to know them makes me feel more for them.. not less. I’ve felt this for two men.

I did take the time to evaluate if I was attracted to men.. because before puberty.. I really didn’t know.. and I worried I might be gay. I remember distinctly when attraction to men kicked in because I was like.. oh.. definitely not gay. At least not 100% gay, for sure. 

Now- I still question. Comp Het is confusing and it scares me.. and I’m in a LTR with a man and the sexual desire seems to ebb and flow.. and it disturbs me. I wonder if I’m MORE attracted to women and what that means. But- yea.. I’ve been attracted to men sexually.. and the above things listed out are reasons I “know” I have."
latebloomerlesbians,fq6pi32,t3_gh5idn,1589135991.0,"You might miss sex with men.. just like you might miss sex with certain types of women and certain types of sex if you commit to a monogamous relationship. That’s ok. Oftentimes the commitment is worth it. 

Or maybe down the road you realize you’re not monogamous.. and you find a partner that is ok with you sleeping with men/women outside the relationship. That’s ok too."
questioning,fq4horu,t1_fq4epki,1589077891.0,Oh shoot.. yea that makes sense!! Good to know. Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me :)
questioning,fq4c5ag,t1_fq47z3u,1589075901.0,"Oh shoot!! I didn’t know that! Sorry! What is the reason behind that I wonder... 

Anyway.. what’s the proper way to say it?"
TwoXSex,fq3zayy,t1_fq3y53z,1589071985.0,Most certainly to which point?
TwoXSex,fq3vikx,t1_fq3pkkn,1589070790.0,Would you say you notice men more in public? Or even split?
TwoXSex,fq3izcl,t1_fq3iao0,1589066954.0,Love it!!! Wow I’ve never related to a human more haha
TwoXSex,fq3foqn,t1_fq3d8lw,1589065979.0,I think I feel the way you do haha.. almost exactly
TwoXSex,fq3bj4w,t1_fq3atj1,1589064811.0,How often would you say your eyes get drawn to men vs women?
questioning,fq3b6m0,t3_ggoh0o,1589064713.0,"Androphilic = to males/masculinity 
Gynephilic = to females/femininity 
Ambiphilix = some mixture of attraction to sexes/gender expression"
TwoXSex,fq35d9c,t1_fq349u7,1589063162.0,Haha.. ok you passed the test! (JK haha)
TwoXSex,fq3463e,t1_fq33uqg,1589062830.0,You have for men though? And fair enough!!!
TwoXSex,fq33ok0,t1_fq31q4k,1589062705.0,"Haha.. I hope this doesn’t come across as rude but, what makes you sure you’re not gay? Or bi?"
HOCD,fq2q00r,t1_fq2pupe,1589058511.0,Congratulations!! I’ll DM you if I have other questions :)
HOCD,fq2pghn,t1_fq2ou7a,1589058366.0,Thank you for this!!! I definitely do engage in the compulsions you mentioned... I’ll check that book out!!!
bisexual,fq2or8b,t1_fq2o21b,1589058179.0,So nice to know we aren’t alone! Even though our journeys are and will be unique.. it’s nice to find another person that is going through something similar.   Ocd sucks!
TwoXSex,fq2lf70,t1_fq13jm9,1589057282.0,Hi I would like to join! I don’t see how to though
latebloomerlesbians,fq2dpmc,t1_fpwurkf,1589055155.0,You’re not alone.. I’ve commented on someone else’s post too. But yea I feel the same as you!
CPTSD,fq1z4o9,t3_ggh1zr,1589051356.0,I never even realized this could be related. I get so panicky every time I put on a mask.. sometimes even have a panic attack and feel like I might throw up
latebloomerlesbians,fq0zqh4,t1_fpyorw5,1589039767.0,"Oh also.. and if this is too personal you can refuse to answer... do you have a history of trauma? Like any kind of trauma? I have CPTSD.. and I relate to this anxiety feeling and in your head feeling you get in relationships. I mean it could be I’m a lesbian, but I really don’t think I am.. so just food for thought"
latebloomerlesbians,fq0xxii,t1_fpyorw5,1589039003.0,"In a way the crushes you are describing sound a bit like infatuation vs love. In infatuation we are attracted and experience passion.. but we don’t deeply care about the other person. Your feelings towards men could be that, or they could be comp het. Everything sounds a bit blurry. Nothing you said stands out as NOT being attracted to men.. but nothing you say is a clear indicator you definitely are. Also it kind of seems like maybe you don’t want to be attracted to men? In which case- just know you don’t have to be with them even if you have the smallest bit of attraction to them."
bisexual,fq0wruo,t1_fpypdo5,1589038612.0,"Thank you for such a thorough answer!!! This has been lovely and reassuring!

Edit: I also think we can have some feelings of anger/betrayal that are valid- while also keeping in mind she’s probably angry and ashamed with herself.. and just knowing that takes away most of my disappointment"
latebloomerlesbians,fpyisbk,t1_fpyfp6r,1589004626.0,"How do you think of crushes? Like what makes something a crush for you? It doesn’t HAVE to mean something that you get crushes every time you get close to a man.. but it could.

Also when you say “passion” what does that mean? What feelings?"
latebloomerlesbians,fpyasdr,t3_gfv9dm,1588999999.0,"What is it you like about sex during the honeymoon period? What makes you feel you are attracted to the men in the beginning? What turns you on in the beginning?

These are important questions to answer because it could either be this is a natural dying down or sex drive after the honeymoon period (that you may experience regardless of gender) or you could be gay"
sexover30,fpxpncm,t3_gg4dcs,1588987053.0,Following this thread because I wanna know too!
bisexual,fpxcxvy,t1_fpxcuh7,1588980220.0,Sounds similar to my experience!
bisexual,fpxc51r,t1_fpx9blg,1588979760.0,"Through me off too.. and I mean.. it’s none of our business but I’d really really like to know everything. I also have OCD regarding my sexuality though so probably not even healthy for me to have all the details lol. I feel cheated too.. and feel guilty about that because I’m sure she feared her fans would feel cheated. I wanna just be like, Girl, it’s not your fault.. honestly I have so much empathy for her.  That said- I really do feel cheated and feel frustrated. I think it’s ok to let ourselves feel what we feel.. without assigning blame of course"
HOCD,fpx7dqy,t3_gfzbj6,1588977089.0,Also nice work not doing compulsions!!!!
HOCD,fpx7cee,t3_gfzbj6,1588977068.0,Saw this yesterday.. thanks for posting! I wish I actually used this for ERP.. instead I gave in and have been doing compulsions all day.. gah
Baking,fpwv481,t1_fpwut7s,1588970528.0,That’s crazy!!!! You’re so talented!!!!
bisexualadults,fpwli9y,t1_fpwlcz6,1588965566.0,I’m afraid too.. and upset. We can’t really know for sure.. we just have to judge the best we can moment by moment. Hopefully she posts a follow up video explaining things more?
latebloomerlesbians,fpwhcna,t3_gfyc1y,1588963463.0,Similar- it honestly varies day by day but I’ve noticed a general pattern of preferring men the second half of my cycle and preferring women the first half. Not sure why!
bisexualadults,fpwf4sp,t3_gfxqs6,1588962354.0,It upsets me a lot too.. but yea our situation isn’t hers! We have to remember that
