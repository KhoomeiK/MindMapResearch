As for goals... I hope to find people that will love me and care about me no matter what, I would also like to travel maybe with said people.

Isn't sticking for few more years worth it? Maybe its torture now and maybe it won't get better, but if you kill yourself there is nothing. And that nothing will be there forever. 

The world will kill you anyways at some point. Why not wait it out. 

You will have enough time to enjoy death but only a bit to try life. So give it a go. Try to get through these few years so at least you have something to think about in the endless void."
