alcoholism,fqhue6f,t3_gim5gq,1589384762.0,"Look at your thoughts and actions, it's a very slippery slope for a reason, it never starts as a problem but could be before you realize it. honestly I'm only on reddit right now because im debating with myself on if i can buy something to drink tonight or am i just itching for a fix after a shitty day at work. I want to say it's not a problem or affecting my work, but from the moment my boss started being a dick this afternoon i mentality started counting down the minutes until i could get a drink. So just be brutally honest with yourself, and if you can't see clearly because of the mental fog that comes with regular drinking in my experience ask a friend, took me a long time to realize my friends weren't joking whenever i was described as a functional alcoholic to new people. But shit i just have to sit here afew more hours and i don't have to worry about the temptation of buying anything. Times like these i really miss being underage as sometimes i didn't have to worry about drinking because i literally couldn't get any... But stay strong, the regret of spending the night sober is better than the regret of giving in."

barista,fqch9p2,t3_gi2y9y,1589258177.0,"Iv been working in a caf√© that only closed 1 day then started doing deliveries and pick up and honestly wish my boss was half as considerate as you sound to be from this post. You definitely can't please everyone, and of course tons of people need every cent they can get, it's definitely not always personal, but people have needs and dreams and they require time and money, time they have to spend working to earn money to live and if lucky try to pursue that dream. With this messed up situation not working is actually the best financial situation, if you were in the same situation it would be easier to understand. Yes you have a business and dreams too, but you don't lie awake at night with them while they are trying to get shit together or vise versa. Would say having a meeting with everyone and trying to have as open a conversation as possible would help alot, gives you the opportunity to show how much you care and everything you've been trying to do and gives them the space to explain their concerns and situations, hope it helps and best of luck to all yall and best wishes"

It went absolutely great for 2 months then i cycled off and haven't felt that level of depression except probably the worst of times. It actually took me a few weeks to look through notes and realize why.
