And how‚Äôs Derek Barnett working out and jaylen Mills he‚Äôs a stud right oh god the list goes on and on and the best part is reagors draft comparison was to Nelson Agholor lol just perfect he had Justin Jefferson in his Lap and said nope fuck that we like Reagor different flavors like baskin Robbins and all his fucking food analogies and he drafted players like Nate Allen my god just these amazing players over and over again chris Polk lol what a stud dude I‚Äôll take the armchair GM‚Äôs any day

eagles,foi5cob,t1_foi4t93,1587779037.0,I don‚Äôt agree with the pick I‚Äôd rather have Jefferson and it‚Äôll show why whenever we get to football but I think unless they‚Äôre picking hurts to package him somewhere during the draft then it‚Äôs an odd pick and our secondary is gonna get burned nooooo not with jalen mills back there he‚Äôs lockdown lol

sixers,fkr5aay,t1_fkqx8s5,1584462118.0,Yea but the difference is Scottie and Micheal didn‚Äôt do the same exact things on the court that hindered each other‚Äôs games. that‚Äôs the big difference both of them have the same exact game so it sometimes kills the offense and it‚Äôs starting to become a big problem. And unfortunately embiid isn‚Äôt a consistent shooter so he can‚Äôt always stay outside the paint and Ben definitely won‚Äôt shoot so they just cancel each other out in big moments.

And embiid always out of shape coming into the season shows me with the time he has he doesn‚Äôt try to slim down at all so that way he can be faster on the court and have more of a motor on defense.
