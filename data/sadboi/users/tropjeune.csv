The one comfort i did have was that I was doing the right thing and could feel morally superior to everyone who was in a more comfortable place than I was. 

Granted, the place i‚Äôm quarantined in is still an apartment and actually smaller than my NYC apartment, but I‚Äôm still in a significantly better place mentally because i‚Äôm not alone.

AskAstrologers,fpdrhs9,t3_gc8hvd,1588532757.0,"I wrote a bunch yesterday but forgot to post and accidentally closed the app so, bear with me here. 

You have a grand air trine involving mercury, Uranus, and Saturn. Grand trines represent areas of our lives that go easy for us naturally, the element involved will tell us what that area is, and the planets will show us how it manifests. Because this area of life is easy for grand trines natives, it can also represent a tendency toward laziness in that area because you are not used to putting in effort. 

Being in air, this grand trine would make it very easy for you to make surface level interactions and it‚Äôs possible that you do not know how to deepen those connections because you haven‚Äôt had to since it‚Äôs easy for you to make new friends. Mercury being involved adds ease of conversation but Saturn and Uranus tell me that there may be frequent change and delays. 

Fwiw I have venus in libra in the 11th as well and I think that venus in the Aquarian 11th house of networks, especially in noncommittal Libra, can make you good at surface interactions although you can remain detached. 

I have a Scorpio moon as well but feel more connected to it because it sextiles my sun and conjuncts mars. Your only positive moon aspect is a trine to jupiter, which is a wider orb.  This expands your emotions, possibly ti a point where the intensity of a Scorpio moon feels out of control. It also squares your Neptune, which signifies a clouded perception of the moon. I also think there can be a tendency to misunderstand planets in the first house because you feel like you can‚Äôt control how they‚Äôre perceived ‚Äî it feels like they just ‚Äúhappen‚Äù to you sometimes. 

Edited because I mixed up some of the planets due to the fact that reddit doesn‚Äôt let you view the image when writing a reply, oops. Added some info on the moon as well after having a better look at your chart

Edited again bc not being able to see the chart in the app made me mix up planets lol so sorry"

Like yes she gives relationship advice, but isn‚Äôt it best to know when to be single than to stay in something that isn‚Äôt working?

That being said, she‚Äôs fucked up pretty massively and her backpedaling has made this 100 times worse. She needs to apologize for real and mean it. Unfortunately based on her last apology I don‚Äôt know if I see that happening, which is disappointing."

AskNYC,fk9t1yy,t1_fk8wj4j,1583982941.0,It‚Äôs certainly not required for any travel within the US yet. To be honest she was probably better off there than here in terms of risking infection given that public transit is used less there and California was more proactive about testing than NY.
FoodAllergies,fk6t6yp,t3_ffv9rc,1583915078.0,"Now in my 20s I would have a mild to moderate reaction, but I was able to tolerate almond milk in a full bowl of cereal in my teen years without a noticeable reaction even though I had reacted to almonds as a kid. HOWEVER it turned out that over time this was causing stomach inflammation from the allergic response."
guyswefucked,fk6f2az,t3_fghkvh,1583900396.0,"I‚Äôd highly recommend using the Laughable app and searching Corinne and Krystyna, it will show you every podcast episode they‚Äôve ever been on. Same goes for almost any comedian/podcaster you want more of"
hingeapp,fjyiy1a,t3_ffd8p7,1583697749.0,I‚Äôve noticed the same with guys in NYC. maybe I‚Äôve just swiped through everyone but my feed has gone from hot finance bros to unattractive guys with not so great jobs.
yoga,fjhubhp,t3_fddcbd,1583355202.0,I bought a lululemon mat on sale and would save it in a fire before I‚Äôd save my roommates. No slipping even in sweaty barre-yoga fusion classes!
nyc,fje1ue2,t1_fjddaoz,1583263583.0,"I cleared my throat on the escalator getting out of the subway yesterday morning and it made the tourists blocking the way standing still in front of me move, so, it‚Äôs not all bad!"
Kibbe,fjbx147,t3_fcmj00,1583203308.0,I think Sophie Turner is SD. Sadly she rarely wears her lines.
nyc,fja8qzt,t1_fj9uhow,1583168678.0,Yes this is the story of my life every allergy season. I think I was just surprised by how early it‚Äôs starting. But it‚Äôs always a surefire it‚Äôs just allergies when I take Claritin and all of my symptoms magically disappear in an hour or two.
nyc,fj9rmge,t3_fcb055,1583157838.0,"With allergy season coming up it‚Äôs gonna be hard for people to distinguish symptoms.  I hope people don‚Äôt panic. My allergies have been wild lately with the weather snapping between warm and cold, so let‚Äôs all take our allergy meds before we freak out at the slightest sniffle (which isn‚Äôt even a coronavirus symptom)"
SuccessionTV,fj8uxhk,t3_fc4ipl,1583122914.0,"Marry: Kendall - I feel like I could keep him in check in juuuuust the right way, I have a massive crush on that sad cinnamon roll

Fuck: Shiv (I‚Äôm mostly straight but, come on)

Kill: Rhea"
digital_marketing,fj84c12,t3_fbtkt1,1583104861.0,"It can be a good idea as a later step in the interview process. For my current job at a legacy media company I had to do a short social audit as a second to last step in the interview process. So no, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cocky, but don‚Äôt go all out so soon."
AskNYC,fj4op9a,t1_fj3qp5x,1583013221.0,Came here to say this! I learned in France to always keep one of these folded up bags in every handbag so you‚Äôre never caught without one. They‚Äôre great and I love not being anxious that they‚Äôll snap or break when I have heavy items.
AskNYC,fj2nan2,t1_fj2l8ut,1582948181.0,Following ‚Äì same here!
scacjdiscussion,fj1j55q,t3_faibva,1582921164.0,It‚Äôs a no for me. It‚Äôs not on long enough to be effective and at worst it is irritating. My skin is extremely dry so it‚Äôs just not the best place for me to source my actives without stripping my moisture barrier.
AskNYC,fj0yyj0,t1_fj0vbws,1582910052.0,With modern technology most professionals can do their jobs remotely. We‚Äôll just all be on Zoom lol
AskNYC,fj0ytx0,t3_fawwsx,1582909988.0,"Yes, basically just reinforcing our remote work policy and encouraging people to take time off or self isolate and work remote if needed to stay well. And of course encouraging hand-washing in the office and providing more communal items to use for regular sanitizing."
Kibbe,fiy4z74,t1_fixkm20,1582832621.0,Oops my bad. I meant the right looks best!
Kibbe,fixj243,t3_fab40y,1582821264.0,"I think the right definitely looks best! I feel like this is a good test to differentiate roundness from width, because the more soft dramatic lines look so wonderful on you

Edit: forgot how right and left works lol"
guyswefucked,fip317v,t1_fi8hp7u,1582596914.0,"I want to love that podcast but I find the sound work is unbearable. Pat has a very high pitched laugh and they don‚Äôt adjust for it‚Ä¶ I listened to Kat and Pat on BechdelCast and didn‚Äôt notice his laugh at all, but the way they mix the sound on seek treatment makes it so high pitched and unbearable. Anyone else notice this?"
guyswefucked,fip2vnq,t1_fi9u0iv,1582596814.0,"It reminds me of the way guys imagine what girls do at sleepovers‚Ä¶ like, they assume we‚Äôre having pillow fights and making out (CHD) but the reality is that we‚Äôre laughing our asses off talking about random shit (GWF)."

Kibbe,fiiy0mg,t3_f83r6s,1582429790.0,"I think weight distribution is very important in determining kibbe and in general, it is important to learn to not see thinness as the default. Because for many of us, it simply isn‚Äôt. I think weight gain can enhance some yin features in the flesh but if you are truly yin dominant in the flesh it won‚Äôt go away when you lose weight. Again, this all depends on where the weight is, too."
