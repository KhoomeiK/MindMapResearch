Of course, Twitter can't read so they think it means we won't be opening UNTIL July 4th."

But, LA County has done the under-promise/over-deliver thing so egregiously through all this that I'm not too down on their recent announcements"
Anxiety,fqmv2ll,t1_fqmtsdv,1589484013.0,"I think so too, but it's weird. We never really had a substantial peak, it seems like we've been riding a flat wave for weeks now.

I might be wrong, but she also mentioned yesterday that they'll have some new Phase 2 guidelines on Wednesday."
Anxiety,fqfhdlh,t1_fqfeyz6,1589324915.0,"The way that article's headline was written is a prime example of how the media is hurting more than helping. Our public health official said that it would be a few months before we could go back without restrictions.

Anxiety,fppsa61,t1_fppk4yw,1588808168.0,"Thanks for putting in the work to calculate all this.

The fact that they surprised us by announcing the opening this Friday is a big deal. All week they kept telling us that we're not opening up with the state and it'll likely be the 15th for the county."
Anxiety,fp7oxxu,t1_fp7g2sv,1588374815.0,"Garcetti and the county have both been staying strong on the 15th as a potential shift into re-opening. Every presser the last few days they've been pressed on that specific date and they haven't indicated that it'll be extended. (Mind you, LA County extended it to May 15th WELL before we reached the original deadline)

I think they'll start opening the lower risk businesses/manufacturing around that time, but they probably want to wait until Memorial Day passes to start Phase 2. Which makes total sense, you don't people having parties like normal on that day."

Los Angeles did randomized antibody testing on 1000 people last weekend. They're going to announce the results on Monday, but our Public Heath Director basically said that they're seeing the same things where it's much higher than the confirmed cases"

Stanford released their antibody test results from Santa Clara county. They show that the amount of people who have developed antibodies is 50-85x the number of current cases! If data holds up, then they are projecting a morbidity rate between .12 and .2%
