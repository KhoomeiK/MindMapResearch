But, if they‚Äôre the kind of problems that if ignored for too long over time will eat away at you or cause more problems, it‚Äôs important to still pay attention to them and face them to deal with them. I‚Äôm taking a break from therapy because I have been feeling better than I have in a while, but I know that I will eventually go back. I‚Äôm going to enjoy feeling good for now, but I know I have more I need to work on. I see it as sort of a summer vacation from mental health work; im gonna celebrate the progress I‚Äôve gained so far, and when my vacation is over I‚Äôm gonna go back and work at it again, so my future will get even better. Obviously, this is just my experience, for others, it could be totally different All that aside, I‚Äôm very happy to hear you‚Äôve been feeling better, and I hope you continue to feel good and enjoy life!

I have learned many coping mechanisms and other skills that with practice have really helped me and I have begun implementing in my daily life.

What I mean by that is, I contemplated therapy for 6 months, sort of preparing myself for it. Once I was in therapy I sort of eased my way in, took it in small steps, like beginning with talking about one thing that I wouldn‚Äôt normally feel like talking about. It surprised me how once I started taking small steps, it became easier. Sort of began to happen on its own. Sometimes things would come out that I wouldn‚Äôt expect, it kind of happened naturally. You don‚Äôt wanna force yourself too hard, but for me it took pushing myself nonetheless, because otherwise I wasn‚Äôt gonna do it. Sort of boring the biting and going for it type thing. It also helps to have a good therapist, I recommend one who specializes in trauma. My therapist has dealt with cptsd himself, so he was very knowledgeable of how to help me do this. A good book about being vulnerable is called ‚Äúdaring greatly‚Äù by brene brown. It talks about how being vulnerable takes courage, and how it can help us in many areas of life. Being vulnerable is something you probably aren‚Äôt used to, and something you probably have shut off for a long time in order to be good at your job and do what you had to do.

But when I finally got in to see a therapist, it changed everything. Therapy can be hard, but It is necessary. One of the biggest hurdles is allowing yourself to be vulnerable and open up to someone, but it‚Äôs a therapists job to listen and help you work through it. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 8 or 9 months now, and while everyone‚Äôs progress is different, I feel so much better and have been able to process a lot of the trauma I have been through.

An old friend of mine reached out to me asking if I was free to help him out. He was helping organize a party and they wanted to include a game called ‚Äúwhite boy rick‚Äù where one white guy sits on stage and whichever girls want to participate dance/twerk on him and they see who is best or something, not too sure on the details. This seemed appealing to me at first, because the idea sounds great and fun, and something that attracts me. But lately I‚Äôve been feeling mixed feelings about sexual interactions as I work through things, which conflicted me. Then I started thinking to myself ‚Äúcmon what guy wouldn‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù and started feeling bad and guilty. Then, I started stressing, because I started thinking about how I could sneak a weapon into the party because I would be stressed something violent was going to pop off. That in turn turned into dissociation about having to stab someone with a concealed pen weapon, and I drove listening to music that‚Äôs as triggering me making it worse. Here comes the victory haha: I turned off the music, turned to healthy coping mechanisms including breath work and mantras, took some time to calm down, and thought hard about what the healthy choice really was. Even though the idea sounded fun, I decided it was not healthy for me, because i already was unable to enjoy it even before I had decided if I was going to go or not.

But anyway, sorry that‚Äôs a little off topic haha, but make sure you respect yourself. As you can see, you‚Äôre not the only one who feels what you‚Äôre feeling. It is okay and it is valid. It is hard, but you can survive it. If you need some time off, that‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs important to listen to yourself and what you need. Sometimes it‚Äôs not as simple as manning up, sometimes it takes loving yourself and allowing yourself to heal. Best of luck in the semester, I hope things go well, please be easy to yourself, you‚Äôve been through a lot and things sound difficult right now."

ptsd,fg85f1a,t3_ewwc9a,1580609997.0,"I relate to this. I am not a veteran but have a few traumatic incidents and the main trauma that caused my ptsd all rearing to violence. As I heal, I also miss the pain and the feelings. I find myself sometimes feeling good about progress and the things I‚Äôm getting better at, then later feeling the exact opposite and seeking out things to get my adrenaline going and literally thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get better‚Äù. My therapist told me about how stress hormones can actually be addicting to the body. Sometimes people who have been in very stressful situations for an extended period of time receive so much cortisol that when they finally leave the stress their bodies go through withdrawal in a way. My therapist told me it can make you do things like subconsciously seek or try to create stressful situations, because just like any addictive drug, the body feels a need for it. I looked it up a while ago, and most articles I found were about people addicted to stress from the work place, so it‚Äôs hard to find information but even those articles will explain it a little bit for you. Ptsd is really challenging, but I know you can make it. I hope you are able to stay sober, and one day sleep in peace and love a more peaceful life. We can all do it. Best of luck"

ptsd,fe69ojz,t3_enw0fu,1578884893.0,"That sounds very horrible to see, I‚Äôm sorry you had to experience it. I think a healthy way to start is to talk about it with your girlfriend and also others your trust. Sometimes traumatic things are painful to think about, so we might not want to think about them. But it‚Äôs good to face it so you can heal from it instead of it affecting you later on. Another important thing to remember is that different serious and traumatic events effect different people in different ways. Person A witnessing this event could become extremely traumatized, while person B might not be as affected. But, person B could be very traumatized from something that doesn‚Äôt affect person A. Both are okay and normal. Trauma isn‚Äôt comparable, and it‚Äôs okay if you feel affected or if you don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just important to remember to respect and listen to yourself, and if you feel like you need it, get help. Best of luck to you"

ptsd,fcx14rj,t3_eizsk8,1578046550.0,"Yeah I can relate. One thing that I get territorial over is food. I have 3 roommates, and I often cook. I tend to be open and let my rokmates take from what I cook, however sometimes I feel myself putting food in certain places that would be harder to see.

ptsd,fbk8ye2,t3_edq2vy,1576946612.0,"I also have ptsd, and one of the traumatic events that has contributed to my ptsd is very, very similar to this. I have also seen the stare, the blood, so many details from your story. The ways you talked to your brothers how you acted, so similar to the event I was in as well. I get flash backs of the stare sometimes even, god I never have seen a face look so dead and without emotion while being alive. This event you went through may be focused on your brother, because he is the one who at the moment is in need of immediate attention. He is the one evrryone was focused on last night, and the one who everyone will continue to be most focused on. That‚Äôs not a bad thing, it‚Äôs important that he gets that focus. He needs the help. But you also need to remember to acknowledge and take care of yourself, and the same for your girlfriend and your mom. This is an extremely traumatic thing you went through, don‚Äôt let yourself forget that. don‚Äôt forget yourself amidst taking care of your brother. I can tell you love your brother very much, and how you cared for him in this situation shows that. You are an amazing person with a huge heart. You did a wonderful job, you could not have done anything better. As you continue to care for your brother, please take care of yourself. It is easy to get lost in caring for someone else and leave yourself behind on accident and neglect what you need, but if you do that it will eventually catch up to you and it will be harder to care for him because your own pain and trauma will no longer be able to be held on the inside any more. I‚Äôm very proud of how you handled the situation, you are a wonderful brother and human being, and from how you reacted in this situation, I know your brother is in good hands and will with time stable out and get better."

There‚Äôs many different methods of consumption, vaping, smoking, gummies, oil tincture, they even have topical cream for people who use it for pain.

Then, as my problems got worse and some repressed memories came up, things got worse for me and weed began to not take me away like it used to, and it made me think even more about my problems. Since then, I‚Äôve gotten into therapy and stopped smoking, now I just use cbd. I‚Äôm still a huge advocate for marijuana and will one day smoke it again when I‚Äôm in a better state of mind, but yes I experienced some backlogging of trauma that affected me similarly.
