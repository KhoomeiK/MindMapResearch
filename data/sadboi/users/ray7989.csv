ptsd,fpi84gt,t3_gdepym,1588635568.0,"I experience something very similar to this, I used to call it “zoning out” before I realized it was from ptsd but my therapists told me it’s a kind of dissociation. Often is about things very unrelated to my trauma, i just go on autopilot and keep doing whatever I’m doing whether it’s driving, washing dishes, showering, etc, and I don’t realize Its happening until it’s finished, and it feels like I was really there and my heart is pounding and adrenaline is rushing and etc. crazy stuff haha"

ptsd,fpi6xs0,t3_gdc6kx,1588634887.0,"I know what you mean. I can relate to that. What I have found is that there is a necessary balance still. If you know what your problems are, that’s great. And if you’re able to keep them to the side and not focus on them and feel better, that’s even better. But, if they’re the kind of problems that if ignored for too long over time will eat away at you or cause more problems, it’s important to still pay attention to them and face them to deal with them. I’m taking a break from therapy because I have been feeling better than I have in a while, but I know that I will eventually go back. I’m going to enjoy feeling good for now, but I know I have more I need to work on. I see it as sort of a summer vacation from mental health work; im gonna celebrate the progress I’ve gained so far, and when my vacation is over I’m gonna go back and work at it again, so my future will get even better. Obviously, this is just my experience, for others, it could be totally different All that aside, I’m very happy to hear you’ve been feeling better, and I hope you continue to feel good and enjoy life! Just keep an eye on yourself to make sure things don’t get too tough without realizing it."
ptsd,fpdbx51,t3_gcim75,1588523955.0,"For sure, I used to smoke a lot to help cope, but eventually getting high just was experiencing all my problems multiplied and worse as well as remembering past traumas and memories. I had to stop smoking, that was almost a year ago, I’ve smoked a few times between then and now and still every time I smoke I just can’t stop thinking about all these problems and bad memories and etc. I’ve tried to approach it as a way of healing, and an avenue to deal with these things, but I’m just not able to when I’m high. I think probably sometime in the future I’ll be able to get high and not experience this anymore, but for now I’m done smoking unfortunatley. I’ll always be a stoner at heart, and I fully support medical and recreational use, but for me I guess it’s just not the right time to use it.

CPTSD,fo0yffv,t3_g2bj55,1587422148.0,"Victory I guess haha. Today was my last session of therapy, at least for a while. I’m leaving the possibility of returning very open for the future, I feel like there will
be things I need support with or want to figure out but for now I will be stopping regularly scheduled sessions. I guess I am experiencing what they call post traumatic growth. I have come a long way, I experience so many less symptoms, and I have come to accept the ones that are still there and probably will be for life. I have learned many coping mechanisms and other skills that with practice have really helped me and I have begun implementing in my daily life. I know there is more trauma to unfold and more to work out, which is why I think I may return in the future, but I have been feeling stable and actually content for the first time in a long time. I guess at least for me, there is no way to say “great, I’m healed” and it’s all over. But I’ve come to accept that, and enjoy however healed I can get. For once, feeling good actually feels good, and I actually want to feel good. I don’t feel angry anymore. When I dissociate I can bring myself back a little easier. I can recognize something that is triggering me and choose to change it. Things are going good. Obviously, more bad will come. That’s life.

The hard part for me, was forcing myself to take a step back from helping people as much as I was used to to place importance in myself. My therapist helped me with this a lot.

I have many friends who use cannabis and it reliably works for them, I guess it just isn’t for me (besides cbd which I use a lot). If you can, consider getting your med card, because it’s safer than running around the cops and also dispensaries also have deals sometimes too that really can make a difference.

I’m not a professional, so I can relate and empathize, but I can’t help you figure out how to take the next step, to keep your drive and desire to help the world as you have done for so many years, while at the same time helping yourself live better and in less pain. Therapists and psychiatrists have more knowledge of coaching and counseling, as well as psychology in general, that could help you with that. I can tell you have a big heart. You’ve helped so many people and you are clearly very passionate about doing so. It’s good to see people like you in the world. We need more people like you. But, if you don’t help yourself, you might become burnt out, get compassion fatigue (its a real thing if you didn’t know), and continue to suffer. And i don’t wanna see you lose your compassion, because you clearly are a special kind of person who really truly cares. I know you can continue to help fix the world even with a career change, and I know you can heal so you can do that effectively.

ptsd,fjmdzfc,t1_fjm1o03,1583468018.0,"I can’t imagine how on edge and ready you are, you must have seen awful things based on that story. Being vulnerable is hard, and for me to be honest it just took throwing myself into it and giving it a shot. What I mean by that is, I contemplated therapy for 6 months, sort of preparing myself for it. Once I was in therapy I sort of eased my way in, took it in small steps, like beginning with talking about one thing that I wouldn’t normally feel like talking about. It surprised me how once I started taking small steps, it became easier. Sort of began to happen on its own. Sometimes things would come out that I wouldn’t expect, it kind of happened naturally. You don’t wanna force yourself too hard, but for me it took pushing myself nonetheless, because otherwise I wasn’t gonna do it. Sort of boring the biting and going for it type thing. It also helps to have a good therapist, I recommend one who specializes in trauma. My therapist has dealt with cptsd himself, so he was very knowledgeable of how to help me do this. A good book about being vulnerable is called “daring greatly” by brene brown. It talks about how being vulnerable takes courage, and how it can help us in many areas of life. Being vulnerable is something you probably aren’t used to, and something you probably have shut off for a long time in order to be good at your job and do what you had to do. It is going to be hard to start. But once you start, it gets easier and things get better."
ptsd,fjkk92h,t3_fdo41y,1583428442.0,"I can relate with the hyper vigilance. Good job helping yourself by taking the step by getting some medicine. It was hard for me to help myself and reach out to someone as well. But, that is the most important step. It took me over 6 months of telling myself I needed to see a therapist to actually go see one. I didn’t wanna have to rely on someone else as well. It got to the point where walking by someone at night in the suburbs I was clutching my knife ready to have to stab someone, a toaster popping up toast making me whip around in my seat heart racing, dissociating like crazy seeing me getting shot in a drive by, crazy stuff. But when I finally got in to see a therapist, it changed everything. Therapy can be hard, but It is necessary. One of the biggest hurdles is allowing yourself to be vulnerable and open up to someone, but it’s a therapists job to listen and help you work through it. I’ve been in therapy for 8 or 9 months now, and while everyone’s progress is different, I feel so much better and have been able to process a lot of the trauma I have been through. I learned coping mechanisms and how to keep myself grounded. I still am hyper vigilant, but not to the extent I was, and I have a different perspective on it now so it is manageable and doesn’t take over my life anymore. You must have seen some crazy things in your time working, and thank you for helping everyone you helped. But now it’s time to help yourself, and help your family too.

So today, my victory was pulling her aside and asserting myself and my needs because of my ptsd and making it clear I was not comfortable with that, and it worked and she received it well and was very apologetic.

CPTSD,fhblizz,t3_ew2nx0,1581444751.0,"Hello, wanted to share a victory I was proud of, wanted to tell someone but didn’t know who to tell. I live in a predominately black area, and I’m white. An old friend of mine reached out to me asking if I was free to help him out. He was helping organize a party and they wanted to include a game called “white boy rick” where one white guy sits on stage and whichever girls want to participate dance/twerk on him and they see who is best or something, not too sure on the details. This seemed appealing to me at first, because the idea sounds great and fun, and something that attracts me. But lately I’ve been feeling mixed feelings about sexual interactions as I work through things, which conflicted me. Then I started thinking to myself “cmon what guy wouldn’t want to do that” and started feeling bad and guilty. Then, I started stressing, because I started thinking about how I could sneak a weapon into the party because I would be stressed something violent was going to pop off. That in turn turned into dissociation about having to stab someone with a concealed pen weapon, and I drove listening to music that’s as triggering me making it worse. Here comes the victory haha: I turned off the music, turned to healthy coping mechanisms including breath work and mantras, took some time to calm down, and thought hard about what the healthy choice really was. Even though the idea sounded fun, I decided it was not healthy for me, because i already was unable to enjoy it even before I had decided if I was going to go or not. So, I told him unfortunately I was spending the night with my family and that I couldn’t make it, and then enjoyed my night smoking some cbd bud and relaxing. Thanks for reading if you did, glad I found a place to share. Best of luck to all"

All that matters is that it’s trauma. I have ptsd too, and am also a college student, and god some professors I have had have been awful. When you mentioned your professor I really related to that. I am a little defensive, and over-opinionated professors like the one you mentioned who think they are the shit just because they’re a professor make me so on edge. The little things feel like slaps in the face of disrespect, I almost went off on a professor last semester and feel like I have one this semester who is extremely similar. College is so stressful in that regard and other social aspects that my therapist is encouraging me to take a gap year to figure more out and get myself straight for a while. But anyway, sorry that’s a little off topic haha, but make sure you respect yourself. As you can see, you’re not the only one who feels what you’re feeling. It is okay and it is valid. It is hard, but you can survive it. If you need some time off, that’s okay, it’s important to listen to yourself and what you need. Sometimes it’s not as simple as manning up, sometimes it takes loving yourself and allowing yourself to heal.

My therapist told me about how stress hormones can actually be addicting to the body. Sometimes people who have been in very stressful situations for an extended period of time receive so much cortisol that when they finally leave the stress their bodies go through withdrawal in a way. My therapist told me it can make you do things like subconsciously seek or try to create stressful situations, because just like any addictive drug, the body feels a need for it. I looked it up a while ago, and most articles I found were about people addicted to stress from the work place, so it’s hard to find information but even those articles will explain it a little bit for you. Ptsd is really challenging, but I know you can make it. I hope you are able to stay sober, and one day sleep in peace and love a more peaceful life. We can all do it. Best of luck"
ptsd,fe69xnv,t3_enlst0,1578885074.0,"I don’t know much about grinding teeth, but I just wanted to say how sweet it is of you to care about him so much lol, touched my heart. Best of luck to you!"
ptsd,fe69ojz,t3_enw0fu,1578884893.0,"That sounds very horrible to see, I’m sorry you had to experience it. I think a healthy way to start is to talk about it with your girlfriend and also others your trust. Sometimes traumatic things are painful to think about, so we might not want to think about them. But it’s good to face it so you can heal from it instead of it affecting you later on. Another important thing to remember is that different serious and traumatic events effect different people in different ways. Person A witnessing this event could become extremely traumatized, while person B might not be as affected. But, person B could be very traumatized from something that doesn’t affect person A. Both are okay and normal. Trauma isn’t comparable, and it’s okay if you feel affected or if you don’t. It’s just important to remember to respect and listen to yourself, and if you feel like you need it, get help. Best of luck to you"
ptsd,fe691cd,t3_enpfzn,1578884451.0,"Meditation really helps calm me down and get me relaxed. I use an app called “one giant mind” but you don’t even need an app, you can just get in a comfortable position, close your eye, and let your breath settle in and just focus on your breath. There’s lots of ways to meditate, that’s just a simple way to get started. I hope it helps"
ptsd,fcx14rj,t3_eizsk8,1578046550.0,"Yeah I can relate. One thing that I get territorial over is food. I have 3 roommates, and I often cook. I tend to be open and let my rokmates take from what I cook, however sometimes I feel myself putting food in certain places that would be harder to see. It’s like even though I consciously want to share and offer it, subconsciously I fight against that. Not just food too, some other things as well."
ptsd,fcfie2l,t3_egndli,1577630301.0,"I always thought I had ocd from the little tics and movements I would do throughout the day when anxious or triggered (or even when not either of the two). My therapist told me it possibly could be my body’s way of physically dealing with what’s going on in my head, sort of like getting it out in a way"
ptsd,fbk8ye2,t3_edq2vy,1576946612.0,"I also have ptsd, and one of the traumatic events that has contributed to my ptsd is very, very similar to this. I have also seen the stare, the blood, so many details from your story. The ways you talked to your brothers how you acted, so similar to the event I was in as well. I get flash backs of the stare sometimes even, god I never have seen a face look so dead and without emotion while being alive. This event you went through may be focused on your brother, because he is the one who at the moment is in need of immediate attention. He is the one evrryone was focused on last night, and the one who everyone will continue to be most focused on. That’s not a bad thing, it’s important that he gets that focus. He needs the help. But you also need to remember to acknowledge and take care of yourself, and the same for your girlfriend and your mom. This is an extremely traumatic thing you went through, don’t let yourself forget that. don’t forget yourself amidst taking care of your brother. I can tell you love your brother very much, and how you cared for him in this situation shows that. You are an amazing person with a huge heart. You did a wonderful job, you could not have done anything better. As you continue to care for your brother, please take care of yourself. It is easy to get lost in caring for someone else and leave yourself behind on accident and neglect what you need, but if you do that it will eventually catch up to you and it will be harder to care for him because your own pain and trauma will no longer be able to be held on the inside any more. I’m very proud of how you handled the situation, you are a wonderful brother and human being, and from how you reacted in this situation, I know your brother is in good hands and will with time stable out and get better."

I don’t know the name or much about it, but I believe it keeps his tongue down in some way to prevent his snoring. Not really sure much more, but maybe worth a google? So sorry you’re going through this tough time, but I know it won’t last forever and soon enough you’ll be back sleeping with your wife."

Since beginning therapy over the summer, I have developed coping mechanisms besides smoking and getting high, and I have lowered my levels of hyper vigilance a little bit and am continuing to work on it as well as a lot more.

Maybe you can talk to a therapist, and they could even suggest a group therapy as well. My therapist recommended it to me, there are some programs where you can have a group of peers in a therapy-like setting. I know you’ll have people around you soon who can support you and give you the love you deserve 👍"
ptsd,f9s2xgg,t3_e6mtnc,1575585053.0,"Intrusive thoughts are something I deal with as well. I use cbd to help calm my mind. It doesn’t take away all intrusive thoughts, but it helps me stay more chill in general with symptoms like hours vigilance and intrusive thoughts, etc. helps my mind slow down. If you don’t know, cbd is a part of marijuana. Basically, it gives you the relaxation effects and pain relief but has no psychoactive effects, meaning you do not get high. There’s many different methods of consumption, vaping, smoking, gummies, oil tincture, they even have topical cream for people who use it for pain. I use this because I do not want to use prescription medication if I can help it. Seems to be doing me well so far; I’ve been using for months. I hope this helps, good luck, stay strong 💪❤️"

ptsd,f9q87c1,t3_e6fydg,1575556855.0,"This is so cool thanks for sharing. I’ve heard about the use of psychedelics to deal with trauma and stuff like that, it always interested me. I used to smoke weed until it began to make my ptsd worse as I would be thinking too much and going deeper and deeper into my traumas, etc. I’m in therapy right now, but I have always thought that approach seemed interesting, I’ve just been worried I would trip out or something, the only drug I’ve used is weed. Do you have any suggestions on where to look for more information or any ideas or anything I can use to look into this a little more?"
ptsd,f9q7dun,t3_e6hu56,1575556453.0,"I’m glad you’re doing what you need to do to take care of yourself. It’s important to prioritize mental health, because if you don’t eventually it will take over and you don’t know where it will lead you. Just because you are dropping out now, doesn’t mean you can’t go back in the future. Just because you don’t know what you want right now and feel lost and aimless, doesn’t mean you’ll feel that way forever. In just a couple years, you might be in a completely different situation, with an idea of what you want to do, maybe a healthy relationship with a romantic partner, and maybe back in university. It’s okay to take time off to figure yourself out, and it’s important. Good for you for making a healthy move! Best of luck!"

You’re not a pussy for that, that’s facing death at a young age with no choice and not being able to decompress after it. No 11 year old should have to do that. Seeing a therapist really helped me begin to work on healing and getting better, j would really recommend it."

ptsd,f6kbj2o,t3_dr60r7,1572909463.0,"Weed used to really help me a lot to cope with stress and my ptsd symptoms. It helped me leave behind my problems for a litrle while while I was high. Then, as my problems got worse and some repressed memories came up, things got worse for me and weed began to not take me away like it used to, and it made me think even more about my problems. Since then, I’ve gotten into therapy and stopped smoking, now I just use cbd. I’m still a huge advocate for marijuana and will one day smoke it again when I’m in a better state of mind, but yes I experienced some backlogging of trauma that affected me similarly. Now that I stopped smoking, I’m able to begin to process my trauma in therapy. Hopefully one day you and me both will have healed from our trauma and can light up some joints for fun haha, best of luck."

Opening up is hard, I used to not be able to and couldn’t imagine doing it. I still have trouble with it and can’t to everyone, but the first time I ever did it surprised me because it actually felt sort of good. Therapy has also really helped me learn how to open up because it can be a safe place to do so. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, but I know you can make it through and heal. And I’m sure your new dog will be there to help you, seems that he is interested in you from how he’s been trying to figure you out. Stay strong, you can make it ❤️"

ptsd,f22w2af,t3_dblrpn,1569898464.0,"Might not really have a tip, but here’s maybe some hope. I can really relate. I feel touch starved in the same way you do from cptsd. All I wanna do is just cuddle someone for once lol. I finally got this the other day. I met this girl, and somehow despite my extreme anxiety, we began to cuddle watching a movie, and wow it was amazing. In fact, right now she’s asleep lying over my lap lol. I honestly don’t know any tips on how I got here, especially because I still have lots of anxiety moving forward with this. But, I know for 100% certain that if I was able to have the experience I just did, that you will too, and that you will move it. Stay strong, I know you’re time will come soon.
