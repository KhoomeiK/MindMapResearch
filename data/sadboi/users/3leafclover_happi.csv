EDanonymemes,fmbeivj,t1_fmbebmo,1585924736.0,Any opinion right now is better than none. Thank you
EDanonymemes,fmbdzc0,t1_fmbdlhm,1585924412.0,"I use to add fuel to those dumpster fires. Not proud but I agree that it is also helpful. But I'm kinda at the point where I'm tired of thinking or talking about me, but I don't know how to stop either. But maybe randos would be helpful in keeping me from shutting out friends"
EDanonymemes,fmbd2uv,t1_fmbcw3l,1585923879.0,God thank you. I can't tell you the weight that just got released off of me from hearing of that method. Omg thank you.
EDanonymemes,fmbc6b9,t1_fmbbw3h,1585923351.0,"No, no, no. It was very poor sarcasm. I need to find a way to stop my paranoia, but so far the only way I can think of doing that, is trying to regain control over those thoughts. Or ask people if they broke into my phone and are monitoring and changing anything in it. Which is definitely not something I'm going to ask. ðŸ˜‚

Honestly, thank you actually. And I'm sorry too."
EDanonymemes,fmbbmgo,t3_ftn42l,1585923012.0,"Oh. Fun. I almost forgot that I'm sure my phone has been hacked by my family, friends, or roommates, (who I'm also paranoidly sure are all talking to each other instead of me) and that everything I see or type is logged. Or even reddit is being replaced, or augmented with their stuff to try and mentally unstable me. 

Lemme go log this thought into a diary instead of eating the rest of my bulk sized ice cream 

But that feeling from the font reminds me of my feeling when google search stopped being dark mode. Halp"

EatingDisorders,flf8f4m,t3_fogdib,1585100381.0,"Before it really set in. I tried to bring it up or ask for help from specific friends. Now they constantly set off my paranoia alarm. Example. 

Last night before our state got the lockdown notice. I went over to their house. I forgot my jacket, because after work was incredibly sunny, warm and made me feel incredible. But it took me too long to get out of the house. So the half hour drive saw the temp drop pretty fast. So now that must've freaked them out or (and I swear I heard them whisper this, ""he's just doing it for attention"") they thought I was trying to obvious or something. Because they proceeded to freeze me out until I was shivering inside the house. Sitting watching Scooby doo on Netflix. With my group of friends that I love. One stood by the french door with it cracked. I'm sitting two feet away. I know what he's doing. I know what he wants me to do. To go grab a blanket.



>> accidentally turned this into a rant so I just split it. But this was really cathartic for me and if I don't keep it as a reply. I won't be able to use this to revisit and rethink about this <<



 But why can't I enjoy ONE FRIGGIN NIGHT with my friends in normality?? I'm sorry. I literally didn't think of a jacket cuz of how warm it is. I have a long sleeve button and a short sleeve under that. Leave me alone. You don't want to talk about it. Because whenever I bring it up or try to talk about issues. You give me looks of incredulity or straight nothing. I hear the whispers and the scathing, (literal) behind the back, remarks. I get you're upset with me. But I'm just as upset with myself. I'm hurting you guys and I need help, but it's hard when I don't want it this much. But no one wants to talk about it anyways even though I've tried to. So why keep bothering when you keep doing things like this? My back hurt from trying to not shiver. Why can't I sit inside a house without a blanket for once? It wasn't even that cold before you opened the door. It was comfortable. I even ate the last slice of pizza you guys left on the counter you said I could have. So why would you do this to me? I can't deal with trying to figure out if what I am paranoid about with you guys is just my wrong way of thinking or actual events, when you guy's keep doing this. Either talk about it. Or don't. But the whispering is destroying me. And I don't have the courage to say anything because I know they think I'm a fake, and when I constantly feel like a fake. It just makes me feel more miserable when I can't eat. Or feel shitty while eating. Or losing control when I am too hurt and sad to protect myself from the horrifically disturbing binges.


But I'm trying. I'm avoiding any of the purge cravings. I'm trying to be careful. But I'm one, broken, simple person. I can't police myself 24/7. I'm alone and came to you. I came to my closest friends and the only people I use to feel comfortable around. Now I'm miserable and I try to engage again. I try to smile and laugh realistically. But the misery turns to melancholy and that turns into a different me. The me I am still trying desperately to relearn control over. 

End rant. 

I'm so so sorry. But it seems like your post got some feelings and words I didn't want to voice, out. So thank you and I'm sorry that your seek of help turned so sour as well. It's hard, especially when sometimes you can understand that maybe they're trying to to do this as a way to help"

EDanonymemes,fk9wdae,t3_fh7xcz,1583985222.0,Idk how. But I lost close to 30 lbs in a month and a half. Without realizing how hard I was restricting and not recognizing that I was either. Once I found out. All of a sudden it was like a light was switched and I tumbled in. Now another month after and I haven't lost any more. Just fluctuating with water retention.... It's like once you want to lose weight. You can't.
