Given that you have gravity and friction your backwards force on a car will always be pointing backwards and down. Rwd cars push from behind this point, pushing the majority of the mass of the car, where fwd are pulling the car forward. What this means is that as you start moving weight is transferred onto your driven wheels in a rwd car, but transferred off your driven wheels in a fwd car.

It's less of a problem on asphalt, but on loose surfaces this transfer can mean a lot."
explainlikeimfive,fpccoum,t3_gcd0bx,1588495589.0,"There are multiple address types when it comes to the internet, domain names are perhaps simply the easiest to remember, and that's kind of why they exist, but let's break down 3 of the most used addresses.

MAC address:
Also known as physical address this is a hard coded address applied to the network interface. The equivalent of this in real life would be like an long/lat coordinates. Recently it's been possible to override the MAC address of devices by spoofing or cloning another device.

IP address:
Your internet address, which can vary wildly depending on your circumstances, but basically boils down to a street address, your IP address gives a rough idea of your location and your ISP.  If your ISP still uses short lease DHCP then your IP could be changing every few days down to every few hours.

Domain address:
These are user friendly addresses that mean very little in technical terms. It would be the equivalent of having a repository of addresses with labels on them such as 'Dave's house', and like this repository a label can point to multiple addresses based on their use or have one address with multiple labels. For instance Dave's house today could refer to where you will find Dave living, at 42a London Road, Winchester, but perhaps because this an apartment block he has his mail delivered to his mum's house at 12 King's Road, Winchester, then the email dave@daveshouse.org will be a different IP to www.daveshouse.org

As to top level domains(TLDs), .com was initially designated for commercial and company purposes, it was also originally intended to be an international designation with each country having their own two letter TLD designation, such as .us .uk .fr etc. .com would have been .co.us for an American company, however this didn't last very long and it became de rigueur for American sites to just assume the international 3 letter TLD. This is why you will see .co.uk, .ac.uk and .org.uk but not their .us equivalent  at least not often. 

TLDs have been issued to every single nation in the world, which lead to countries such as Tonga (.to) selling theirs off as they simply weren't being used.

More recently TLDs have been relaxed even further, allowing for .kitchen, .health and hundreds of others that don't fit the original rules, but .com remains the most popular, as it's undeniably the most memorable."

You are right that the money needs to come from somewhere, but ultimately that sustainability is dependent on spending it. Most modern economies are based on the spending of money that doesn't yet exist, governments are funded by this spending and in a situation where UBI is a thing purchase taxes will be a bigger thing than income tax. 

This said, for UBI to work it would need to be sustainable. Of course I'm fairly certain that it would be, a universal basic income wouldn't have to be that much and I sincerely doubt many people would live on it alone. It's possible to live on JSA (jobseekers allowance) here in UK, although it would be tough, I know this because I have done it, and I've done it recently while living in the London commuter belt, UBI wouldn't necessarily be a replacement to work, at least not at first, but just a baseline income available to everyone if they can't work.

Edit: my apologies, I dropped my phone which submitted this before I'd finished.

As for survival, it's a good start, and given the current ecological and cultural direction of humanity, it would be a particularly high goal. But I'd like you to look at how small a percentage of the population I'm suggesting here, given that I don't know anyone who would be happy sitting at home day after day 10% wanting to work would, in my mind, be conservative an assumption. The truth is that with every generation more and more of our jobs are being automated, you can now order food and do your full shop without dealing with people. The chances are, although I won't say it as you could very well be a doctor, nurse, farmer, etc. but the chances are that your job is frivolous to human survival, as most jobs are, and I say this as a key worker still employed in a locked down environment, but my job is frivolous to human survival even.

Let's be honest, we're talking about a socialist idea, and socialist governments tend to fail dramatically, so there would still need to be a decent amount of reward to those who do work on top of their guaranteed income, and as you say productivity needs to be kept up.

I don't know that it would work, I didn't actually say that it would, just that the confidence of money coming in increasing an economy would be an argument towards such a scheme, and be aware that even if it did work, I'd still be working."

Some people do work because they enjoy their work, and would continue working if they were billionaires, whether it's the accumulation of money or a love for what they do, they still work beyond having to.

There are actually very few jobs out there that are required for humanity to survive, we don't need TV, the Internet, videogames, smartphones or fast food, for example, and a lot of these jobs producing these products can be automated. The other point is that automation is happening, and there's no way to stop it. I'm not worried about this, as in every case before where human resources have been made obsolete other kinds of jobs have crept up, this will be the same, but it might also allow us to stay at home, or work on things we would prefer to work on.

You have to remember that not everyone is a lazy shit, I get bored very quickly when unemployed, and honestly as long as perhaps as little as 10% of our current workforce is willing to continue working, for extra pay, obviously, humanity will survive, I think 10% of people willing to work and be valuable to society is being extremely conservative.

They would be the minority by a long way, but I wouldn't be surprised if they wielded some powerful psychiatric and psychological positions."

I'm not sure it was necessarily too bright, just too distracting. I felt like it was demanding attention."

I don't care whether 'frredom of movement' is a legal term with a strict definition because, and I appreciate that you might not be able to follow me here, but there are a lot of people who don't know that. I wasn't addressing you or your knowledge of it, and neither was I muddying anything. 

I appreciate that words are hard for you, so I'll sum it up in as few syllables for you.

Holiday may be still good. Moving life bad.

Understand?

As for replacing the EU, yes I would like to see it replaced, in an ideal world we should have a globally open market, tbh. Also my point wasn't about how good the US is, because it obviously isn't. Bringing EU-wide fiscal policies in one by one and allowing some states to sit outside certain options doesn't create a even playing field, and introducing countries that can't hold themselves afloat has lead to a ragtag of countries all loosely following the parts they like and pissing on the others. We were one of these countries in a unique position and better off than the rest, for instance controlling our own interest rates, and now we're out if we do ever rejoin we won't have that option.

The EU should be done again with tighter entrance criteria, stricter rules on compliance and a clearer end goal. After all, isn't the aim to have a federation or union of all nations to better our scientific and political progress? Joining the European branch makes the most sense there.

I will commend you on using a c in sceptical, though."
BMW,fhdwz1u,t1_fhdowou,1581505797.0,"To be fair, for the price range Hondas are on point. Your problem should be with the driver, not the car, unless it's self-driving. It would be the failure of the driver that he, or she, could have been doing 60mph in a space already occupied by another car, and Honda or not, it would still have destroyed this BMW.

The Honda Jazz has a reputation for being driven badly, true, but so too do BMWs. The Jazz is an inexpensive small car with a lot of practicality and a decent engine, which makes it attractive to those who haven't yet had the confidence knocked out of them and to those who probably should have given up their license years before. I've received no hand-outs from my family and when I leart to drive there wasn't any such thing as an affordable BMW, instead I had a UK spec Honda CR-X which, thanks largely to its weight, or lack thereof, pissed over my friend's 3 series (323 e36 iirc) both on and off the track.

If you want to have a hate boner for anyone there are far better targets, like the Chinese company that owns MG, who have taken an epic British marque responsible, at least in part, for the sports car and are producing cheap cars and trying to trade on the name"
BMW,fhdvefj,t1_fhdq73r,1581503622.0,"I was given a V90 XC after my 5 series was written off and everything about the Volvo's interior was awful, iyam, the lights were too bright, even after dimming it all the way. It was just permanently there, in my peripheral vision, demanding attention. I honestly hated it. I sat in a new 540 the other day in night mode and it was far less obtrusive and bright, I'm just glad I could give the Volvo back."

The term freedom of movement is vague, and I was trying to find the only possible way the argument could be valid. I've lived in several EU countries, and while I have no plans to move from the UK currently, I do dislike that the option is being closed to me. I should have applied for an Irish passport while I could."

unitedkingdom,fhduae1,t1_fhc2qxo,1581501997.0,"Technically there's no reason the freedom of movement as tourists should stop as that's not the EU, and other non-EU members are part of it, but freedom of immigration, or rather emigration, as that's the bit we actually care about, will stop. Also this isn't Britain finally admitting, it's the brexit idealogues admitting it.

Honestly, and I say this as a remainer mind you, the EU could do with being restarted, with clearer goals. Europe has too many differing cultures to be a single superstate a la the USA. I feel a lot of this (and the potential break-up of the Union) is based off the decisions of politicians who think they have the full support of their populace simply because they won the election. I just hope Boris can do better."
