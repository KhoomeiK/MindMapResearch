sex,f7ncja5,t1_f7na50p,1573895529.0,Thatâ€™s your mindset why does it matter how you cum ? Some women canâ€™t ever cum during sex just because of nerves. Donâ€™t feel bad! Try using a vibrator on your clit while getting penetration. Double the orgasm lol.

ptsd,f7dn3v8,t3_dvibq0,1573621899.0,I was diagnosed bipolar too! ADHD first. Then bipolar. Then depression and anxiety. Then final diagnoses were ptsd and dissociation but now I just struggle with anxiety. Trauma is different for everyone ğŸ™‚ğŸ–¤

Love,
 someone who has been through multiple serious traumas and has serious medical issues from it ğŸ§¡ 

Stay strong."
