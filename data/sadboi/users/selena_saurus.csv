They didnt believe me and tried to shun me from going with my then boyfriend. Also an attempt to keep me from seeing my then boyfriend now husband. When a fellow LARPer died in a horrific car crash after trying to go home after a practice event my parents said he shouldnt have been at the practice anyway because LARPing is stupid apparently.

My boss at least doesnt get mad when a client disputes a bill but he will also ask me to make the corrections. He really sucks at billing clients and communicating with them about how much it will cost. They often call because their bill is much more than he originally estimated. Its not my responsibility so I'm not gonna worry about it. I just try my best to follow my bosses billing instructions and check them twice to make sure I didnt make a mistake even though I still do sometimes. I don't read numbers wrong all of the time but it happens often.
