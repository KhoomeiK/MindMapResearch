China is going strong and Russia is *far worse off* by almost any objective measure you can use since the fall of the USSR. They most certainly didn't get any democracy out of the deal. Also look into how Yeltsin was a capitalist who had already left the Communist party years prior to taking over and orchestrated the ""fall"" of the USSR with the help of the West. Reagan and Yeltsin were besties after-all. 

A lot of the smaller republics going independent had way more to do with escaping authoritarianism than escaping communism. I'm fully counter-authoritarianism so I'd guess we'd agree on that.  

I had used the USSR as an example of an economic model besides capitalism that was incredibly successful, not to advocate for it being a solution in the 21st century.

Futurology,fqxku4w,t1_fqxidco,1589733857.0,"It's already saving us money *out of pocket* because the loan payment, plus our lower electricity bill is about $700/year less than our old electric payment.

In terms of overall investment, we got 3 years of federal tax rebates (It is my understanding that this was an older program, I'm not sure if it is still in place) and a large rebate from our power company the first year. That covered about 60% of the total cost of the unit. Without that, I wouldn't have been able to do it.

But, going on a rough estimate, it'll take about 10 years to break even. The loan was for 15 years, and the panels are guaranteed for 25 years. So we will have *at least* 10 years of worry-free free power. 

And that's not counting rising rates. If the power company raises rates, which they have done every year since I've lived in this house, it only effect me for the 20% of the power that I'm buying from the power company. Whereas, it affects my neighbor at 100%.  So, if rates keep rising, that will shorten that length. (This will probably come out in the wash with the 5% apr on the loan).

Then, of course, if we ever decide to move, we have to hope we can get the value of the panels as additional price for selling the house.

So, there's a lot of moving parts, but with rising power rates, and the tax rebates, it finally made financial sense to pull the trigger when we did.

edit: Oh, I forgot to mention, I can sell back any excess power I generate in a month to the power company, but there are some restrictions: They buy it back at a much lower rate than they sell it for (This should be illegal, IMHO) and they buy it back by putting a credit on my account, but that credit only carries over for 30 days, so if I have back to back months with a credit, I lose it. Kind of a shitty deal but the power company is way more powerful at lobbying the state government than an individual power producer like myself. My state also requires that systems be connected to the grid, so even if I had a 100%+ system, I'd still have to be tied to the grid.

There's a lot of work to be done to lobby the government to change the laws to be less in favor of the big power companies."
