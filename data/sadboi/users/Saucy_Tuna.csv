Petioles,fk0buti,t1_fk097ng,1583751404.0,"Honestly, the best way to quit that is to start thinking about your lung function. Going for a run will help motivate you to NOT smoke anything. 

But, I understand that struggle. Again, if you need to, just vape 0mg nicotine liquids if you have to. I heard of somebody putting water in their vape b/c they were afraid of using any liquid that could contain nicotine ( I recommend not doing this lol), but find something for yourself to emulate that feeling of exhaling something out.

Mints/Mint gum helps to emulate the feeling of menthol hitting your throat( Just like a camel crush). Ill follow it up with some water to give me that sensation lol."
Petioles,fk0bmez,t3_ffpyq0,1583751129.0,"You're right on being too hard on yourself. I feel you on the disappointment, but you actually made a **rule** on how much you should be smoking it. That's a good amount willpower and responsible usage. That shows more effort and displays a lot more understanding about your relationship with the drug than a lot of stoners I know online and in IRL (including myself lol).

Like you, I have a struggle with justifying the use of weed to **concentrate** on my *programming* studies or my *art.* It always put me in the mood back then to just blaze a joint or take a bong rip then let my hand and that pencil go. The one thing I asked myself is that, *""Why do I need to get high in order for me to express and de-stress myself?""* That thought kept plaguing me, each time I was smoking weed, cigs or taking any other drug. Then I started smoking it to fill the boredom (just like you lol).

Im 8.5 days off weed of a *long T-break* now after years of daily abuse of this drug. It's good medicine and if you moderate it, can be the most blissful thing in life to keep your mind at peace. Unfortunately, I can't use it right now because I know I have underlying things to fix. It's still amazing though that you recognized this and are exercising that willpower so freely. Good job!"

I feel you on the alcohol addiction. I never drank up to the point I had shakes, but the withdrawals are fucking horrible on alcohol. By all means, smoke weed if you need to to keep off alcohol!

I'm pretty sure you know this by now since you went to rehab, but the reason you started drinking alcohol could very well be the same reason why you're still using substance to self-medicate. I feel you though, smoke higher cbd strains if anything. Indicas got me off of alcohol and opioids, so I recommend those.

You can do this. If this helps, download an app called ""GROUNDED"" (It's on the apple store for iOS, not sure for Android). It helps you to keep track of the days. The app is free, but i paid $2 for the extra features. Most of these features mainly track the different withdrawal symptoms (night sweats, loss of appetite, mood swings, etc.)

tbh I am not coping well either. I got back into drinking beer to calm my nerves, but Ive had a problem with this before. Sorry to hear you're on xanax. You must have GAD like me (or something similar). I stopped using xanax cuz I got addicted to it. The best thing to do is to go and do cardio or lift weights to keep your mind off of the anxiety.

I had a best friend from grade school who would learn about cars through the Gran Turismo games (keep in mind this was back in the early 2000's) and now he works on not only cars but also on airplanes. This guy never went to college or anything. He even had a 1. something GPA back in grade school, but he was so passionate about cars that he'd read his uncle or dad's car's manual(s) or read the description on the different tuning setups you can establish in different simulation racing games. This guy is now one of the most valued mechanics at his workshop AND he's a HARDWORKER TOO. Unfortunately, I moved out during High School so I couldn't see exactly everything on how he managed to become the person he is today, but keeping up with him after all these years, I noticed that all he did was just work on his car, hang out with car heads, fellow mechanics and attend car meet-ups, AFTER his shift was over.  
Even if it was a 10 hr shift or 12 hr shift, he'd find the time and place to jack his car up somewhere or find some way to learn about it.

Another way to learn is to save up money to buy a used car of your choice and make it a project car. It can be a shitty car with high-mileage or some displeasing aesthetic changes. Buy the bare essentials to work on a car's parts ( tools, a car jack, oil)  and start finding documents online or youtube the information and learn to apply what you learned.

I've snooped around other programming related posts and a lot of experienced programmers who started or at least know C are able to use the C language for simple programs and simple machines.
