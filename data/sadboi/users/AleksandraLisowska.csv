So the second, and harder, is get to therapy, talk to your husband/wife and tell it exactly how it is, raw, so he/she knows, get some nanny or anyone who can take care of your kids in the moment so that you can breath, for real. The therapy is because you are not feeling ok with your situation in any way it seems, and there is nothing wrong with it, we are humans, definitely not perfect, but you have kids that don´t get it by the moment, and it's not fair to them if it's not to you, they feel it.

 Why?
1.- Children break/kinda ruin stuff, it's almost their trademark, therefore that cup of apple juice wherever it went was gonna spill, in my experience it's always the furniture, but it was your sister's gaming laptop. (Laptops aren't cheap, gaming laptops are definitely expensive)

2.- Your sister offered to take care of your babe because she loves him and loves you, it wasn't her first time doing it and I think she may have relaxed too much given the fact that it wasn't even the first time doing it, so yeah, she left her laptop on the floor and we know what happen.

So OP, it's not your fault, it's not hers either, and she must feel awful bc gaming laptops are made to last, so dead laptop by apple juice it's a shame. 


You should offer her to cover the REPAIR half and half, and never again trust her with your child, cause I'm guessing neither of you want to go through this again."
