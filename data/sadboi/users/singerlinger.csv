Living under the threat of a breakup or divorce is enough to drive a sane person batty, let alone someone who already suffers from depression. 

To top that off, should it work itself out, washing the resentment from the relationship is damn near impossible :you return to a relationship that made you unhappy, she improves for a relationship that may still leave you unhappy. 

Obviously therapy helps but if you have to parent her by making sure she takes her medication, you’re crossing that caretaker/partner threshold. How can she be honest with you as a partner if it means speaking against one of your ultimatums? 

To be honest, your ultimatums seem like a way to wash you of responsibility when/if she fails, leaving her devastated and worse off.

I would not criticize someone using thier money to vote on ethics. But instead of trying to remove someone else’s rights, support affordable birth control for people who do not have access. And affordable child care, living wage, affordable healthcare, mental health services, women’s shelters, sex education etc.
