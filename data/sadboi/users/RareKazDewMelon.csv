The major issue I think Lurrus has is that it locks out a lot of useful hate pieces/sideboard tech like Leylines, value planeswalkers, etc., so it's not as competitive in the Modern matchup lottery if it has a gimped sideboard."
ModernMagic,fo4g349,t1_fo3relw,1587503779.0,"Wizards trying to save face shouldn't be a game design consideration IMO. Despite their frequent mistakes like busted mechanics or last-minute changes slipping through the cracks, I'm still convinced that M:tG's R&D team are probably the best and most experienced game designers that exist right now.

However, it really feels to me like they are having some kind pride/chain of command issue where they just cannot roll back mistakes or tone down the constant stream of pushed cards"
ModernMagic,fo4eyfd,t1_fo47zgr,1587503200.0,"I know this argument basically boils down to ""no u,"" but conversely, the mechanic existing isn't really ""fair"" to the people who don't like it at all and feel like it violates 2 fundamental parts of mtg.

To be honest, the mechanics just doesn't feel like it belongs in eternal formats at all. Formats like Legacy and Vimtage will just slowly find a way to utterly break all 10 companions and get them banned over the next 6 years, or we could just wipe them out now. Modern, on the other hand, will probably not have any genuinely busted decks, but cards that people like are probably gonna get splash damage bans because that just sort of happens."

Also, magic cards should cost mana. Balancing free or or undercosted spells has long been magic's largest issues."

Critical misses aren't any different according to core, but some features will trigger differently on crit fails.

Feats, on the other hand, make up almost all of your major decisions. There are class feats, ancestry (racial) feats, skill feats, and general feats.

Class feats essentially fill the role of subclasses in other systems (although some classes do have some non-feat options). Skill feats cover stuff like item creation, social skills, exploration, and secondary combat buffs (intimidation, grappling, etc.). General feats and ancestral feats allow you to customize your character and make them tangibly *good* at things.

Casters also have interesting differences that make them feel quite distinct.

Anyone who feels 5e has become overly uniform or a bit of a drudge (i.e., you find yourself houseruling things because 5e is missing good rules for so many things), I STRONGLY recommend looking through pf2's rules. Better yet, the full rules are [free here](https://pf2.d20pfsrd.com/)"
dndnext,fmu7iab,t1_fmu4t0m,1586386014.0,"Overall, everything works the same with different numbers. The 3 action system is glorious, fluid, and the one place that pf2 is simpler than 5e.

The main differences:

+Every spell, action, creature, and ability has ""traits"" or ""tags"" that can interact with other abilities. I can get more detailed on this part if you want but it goes very deep into the veins of the system.

+No bounded accuracy, so ACs and to-hits go up every level to very high numbers.

+To accent the lack of bounded accuracy, there are 4 degrees of failure on most checks: Critical Failure, Failure, Success, Critical Success. I can also talk more about this but it leads to the system feeling very finely balanced and makes small buffs to attack and defense feel meaningful and worthwhile

+Feats. For. Everything. This leads to deep and meaningful character customization where your choices matter and characters feel unique."
