AskReddit,fon9mtv,t3_g88ccd,1587915178.0,"This was thanksgiving two years ago. Me and my three siblings were at our shore house for thanksgiving because my parents just got it. After dinner my mom got drunk and started yelling so I decided just to drive home (2 hr drive) with my dog. When I get home, I can see all the lights in my house are on, but there is no car and my dog is an aggressive dog whod kill anyone who tried to hurt me so I decided to go in. I went inside and there was loud repeated banging in the walls, the ceiling was shaking, and the lights were flickering because of it. I took my dog, ran into the bathroom, and called 911. I watch a lot of crime stuff, and my immediate thought was that some drug addict knew we were gone and broke in to steal the lead pipes from our walls to sell because it sounded like someone was in the wall. For me to feel unsafe enough to call 911 is a very big deal. Cops come, they find nothing and leave. I felt super weird so slept at a friends house that night. When my parents got home they heard the same noise and investigated - turns out there was air bubbles in our water heater or something like that causing a horrendous noise. Embarrassing but hey"
