ptsd,fk74e7m,t1_fk6hobv,1583927354.0,"I actually listened to an audiobook on PTSD a few months before starting therapy (The Body Keeps The Score, I highly recommend), and EMDR was mentioned. Repressed memories was also discussed and I thought ""Wow, that's crazy that your brain can just seal off memories to protect you. Something so big and traumatic happens, and you don't remember until years, sometimes decades later with therapy? That's incredible!""

I never thought I'd be one of those people who just ""forgot"" a huge chunk of their trauma. But here we are. It's a fascinating and interesting concept until it happens to you, then you feel like you're losing your mind a little. I still having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that it happened. But everything lines up. I remember every little detail now, like Pandora's box was opened. I'm actually typing this up now (5:47 a.m.) because I woke up from a ""reliving"" nightmare and am killing time till the alarms go off.

EMDR is tough. Suuuuper tough.I read up on it a lot before deciding to do it, then at the end of my first visit with my therapist (where we just got acquainted, I gave him a brief rundown, and he explained how it's going to work), he asked me, ""So, you still sure you want to do this? Don't feel like you have to because you made this appointment."" That was the beginning of October, and I have an appointment this afternoon with him. He's the best. He doesn't force things, but prompts just enough that I want to keep going. He's super laid back and friendly, and he makes small talk in between processing hard things to help ground me.

I hear you. It's a 2-sided coin. I'm glad I know everything now, so I can properly deal with it in therapy and I have some closure. But at the same time ""ignorance is bliss"" sounds so good. 

When it happened, I was... a very good actress. I didn't want to raise any flags because he was spending the day with us (yes, he spent the day with us shopping and whatnot acting like nothing happened). I don't know why I didn't say anything that day. I only cried while it was happening. I was completely in denial from the second it ended.  Addressing the blood in the mall bathroom, I was completely detached from the reason. Just thought ""better clean up"" and did so gently because everything was all fucked up down there. Luckily I always wear a liner, so it wasn't too bad.
I remember it being painful to walk around all those stores and making sure he was always in my peripheral vision. I didn't want him behind me, and I wanted to look at him as little as possible. Thinking back, I did spend more time in bed over the next few days than I normally would have, I guess from shock and being in pain. I bled for 4 days after. He wasn't gentle.

I guess once I felt normal again physically, that was it. I still remembered everything leading up to and after, but not the actual rape. I told my mom about 5 months after about what I did remember (hand stuff I did NOT consent to) and we talked to a detective. She talked to him and I and determined I was lying and it was a case of ""a lover scorned"" (he was my ex and we were trying the whole ""just friends"" thing) and he left with an apology from the detective. While guilty of full-on rape. 

And he denies it to this day. His current girlfriend messaged me recently asking what happened between us, saying she ""had to hear it from me."" So I gave her all the details, including the legal stuff.  She wrote back that that's not the man she knew and how he was hurt and didn't know ""why I was doing this to him so many years later."" and that he was working toward ""forgiving me."" It took all I had to stay civil. He told her that I admitted to lying because I was mad he broke up with me and apologized. Among other things, I corrected that, because I didn't say a word to him that day. I never got another response from her. 
 I felt like I owed it to her to tell her the story because I'd want to know if I were in her shoes. She's also got 2 daughters under 10 to think about. Not saying he's a predator, but I told her what she asked for, and she can do whatever she wants with that info. 

tl;dr: EMDR good but hard, don't underestimate the power of shock (or someone's smooth-talking/lying skills), justice system sucks, and some people just lie so hard they decide it's the truth."
ptsd,fk6evys,t1_fk6d22c,1583900268.0,"Oh, I vomit about 80% of the time in the parking lot after therapy (EMDR).

I was raped at 15, and I suppressed it so hard immediately after (driven by the whole ""this isn't happening"" train of thought) that it basically ""went away"" until a couple years ago when I started having health problems nobody could explain. It was all psychosomatic. Then in late 2018 I started having nightmares about the part I knew/remembered happening. Those got progressively worse until I was diagnosed in March 2019. Then the dam broke not long after. The nightmares started getting more elaborate and graphic (I started journaling them and filled half a composition notebook before July when it was taken away at the mental facility I ended up checking myself into) and I was having what I later learned were body memories. I didn't know why I was screaming and crying and writhing around like I was on fire, but it was my subconscious and body remembering what I went through. 

I didn't get the full memory back until November after I started EMDR therapy. A repressed memory came back that made the rest make so much more sense, and made me feel sick and angry.

It was like a deleted scene got put back in the memory of the incident. 

Who I thought I lost my virginity to was actually my second partner, and I didn't know.

My rapist got away with more than I thought these past 9 years, and he knew it. I was called a liar. 

The memory is whole now, every single graphic little detail, including dialogue, the rest of that day, and the few days after that I remember bleeding.

Post-diagnosis, my resting heart rate on my beta blockers is between 90 and 110.

 My boyfriend took my blood pressure right after I had a flashback (screaming, crying, shaking because I was crying so hard and no more air would come out, matted hair at the end, eyes closed the whole time, body memories) and was in the weird, exhausted, dazed and half-conscious state and told me it was around 130/90.

I might pop over to Walmart near my apartment just to try on some shirts, see around what size is need and what it'd look like on me."
ptsd,fj9pn6y,t1_fj923vo,1583156319.0,Absolutely no problem. Sometimes it's just comforting to hear you're not alone. ♥️
ptsd,fj8vhil,t1_fj8spb4,1583123354.0,"My boyfriend and I have dim string lights in our room for at night, but that doesn't seem to help or hurt. 🤷‍♀️

My sleep schedule is non-existent, basically. I just push till I can't anymore, then go to bed. I'm unemployed, waiting on disability, so that's ""working"" for now. But busy days kill me. 
Today was grocery shopping then visiting my parents. I unintentionally crashed on our couch for about half an hour in between the two.
The holidays were HELL. I needed a holiday from the damn holidays. 🙄

My current med cocktail helps me sleep pretty much through the night (going to bed with boyfriend around 10:30/11:00 until 5:00 a.m.) with maybe half-waking up for a few minutes here and there, but I wake up exhausted. And if I do have a nightmare, I don't wake up at the climax of it like before; it just keeps going. So, it's not really ""restful sleep.""

I wish I could be more helpful. 😕

I guess we're all just trying to figure out how to navigate this ""new normal."""
ptsd,fj8f60s,t1_fj8e9ii,1583111977.0,"That's how my mind works. I have night terrors and have anxiety about sleeping, but only at night. I can sleep all day, no prob. 
PTSD itself, meds aside, just exhausts you. It makes sense if you think about it: our bodies are constantly under stress, waiting to escape danger. It takes a toll."

FreeCompliments,fi9wtui,t1_fi9ddwk,1582285793.0,"I totally agree with that last part. Someone can ""be a 10"" until they open their mouth, then drop to a 4. Likewise, someone who isn't considered conventionally attractive can be a solid 10 after a conversation with them.  I tend to be more attracted to personality and demeanor in a person. ""Beauty"" as we've been taught really is only skin deep. True beauty is inside. Nobody can judge that just by looking at you."
FreeCompliments,fi9a1tk,t1_fi96f1h,1582259421.0,"Thanks for that. I should have known better.

 My self esteem has always been either ""fuck you, I'm awesome!"" or ""do I even deserve to breathe air?""

No in between.

I guess that part of me is what made it difficult to participate in roasting other people. Like, my *best* one was telling a girl something about holding her sign crooked. I couldn't do it like the other commenters.

And thank you. My eyes are my favorite natural feature. They're the only part of me that I always find genuinely beautiful."
