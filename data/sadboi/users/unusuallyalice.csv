I am still conflicted if this is a mental health thing because I have been diagnosed as schizoaffective/schizophrenic for several years. I have never felt like a human being, I first thought about it when I was 4 years old. Of course, the way I thought about it was different. At 4 I thought, ""What if I'm not a person, and am something else that is sleeping?"" I don't think I am in a dream world necessarily but this world to me feels like an organic simulation. 

Starseeds are beings that incarnated on Earth for a purpose, and they originated elsewhere. I see myself as having been a n entity from a different dimension, which is why entities punish me constantly to prevent me from helping humans.

Again, I'm still conflicted on everything because medication does make me think about everything less. You're not alone in this feeling, though."
schizophrenia,fqz0yly,t1_fqz0ecl,1589757958.0,"Not psychotherapy in my case, I can't afford it (I'm in Canada and it isn't covered under health care), but I have done counselling that has used some CBT and DBT with me. Counselling doesn't inherently go as in depth as psychotherapy from my understanding, but it's a start. None of it will do much good if he doesn't see a problem/doesn't want to change. 

As for the treatment resistent stuff, sometimes you gotta try a number of antipsychotics. The last resort is usually clozapine but its a risky drug. It can take time to find the right meds. Misdiagnosis can happen too, so you're not wrong for wondering. If it is a personality disorder, which no one can diagnose over fhe internet and without the proper credentials, therapy is probably the best option, but it doesn't work if the person doesn't want to see differently."

The worst of this was when I consumed most of a shatter chocolate bar, which I know eating is very different than smoking and I used to be an avid smoker and while this scenario is much worse, the effects are different levels of this:

I kept time traveling and going through different dimensions. When I was sometimes in this world, I could only move in slow motion. I kept forgetting if I was sitting or standing, and where i was sitting or standing etc. I was actually sitting in a very, very awkward position for a few hours. I kept tuning in and out to voices. I tried to speak out to them but barely could mutter a word. They kept telling me I sealed the deal and I'd be terribly schizophrenic forever. Time kept changing on me.

To strangers I seem really standoffish until they get to know me if that ever happens. I can be just as chill as I am intense, but my intensity is mostly expressed textually as like i said I am pretty blunted or flat. 

It depends on the closeness of the person, also. My family thinks I'm a cold and heartless asshole, my friends know me a bit better in that I mean well. The reason I am cold to my family is because I don't give in to emotional manipulation or manipulation of any kind. If people hint things at me I flat out ignore it until they absolutely ask for what they want.

 It's time for me to blow through my compulsory credits, get into the Transitional Year Program at my local university and get into uni as a mature student.

Edit: I believe you mean 16 and not 13-14, because for most things, a 16 year old was considered almost an adult despite this idea changing in the last decade or so.

The ""facts"" you're suggesting do not line up with any experience I've ever had in Ontario. But I haven't ruled out that it might've been a provincial thing because Canada is actually not one solid entity. Provinces are similar to states.

Your brain isn't even fully developed yet, so there is hope. Your brain won't stop developing until around 25 give or take. So just take good care. 

I do also recommend seeing a professional."

Not in the same boat, but I know how hard it is to find professionals in this city despite it having better resources.

They may not be a good fit for you, you may have to look elsewhere, unfortunately. It may take a while. 

Plus, many ADHD meds are psychostimulants, and thus I would think they won't necessarily curb anxiety. I'm no professional, but it doesn't hurt to try hard to find a second opinion."
schizoaffective,fgbk2nj,t3_exqly9,1580662879.0,"Good days are possible. It's true.

Though, this is also a place where people are seeking support for their hardships as well, so there is probably an imbalance but that's just the nature of a support board. 

I am really glad you and your partner have had good days. Sometimes people only get sick once in a way that still justifies a diagnosis, but then never fall into a psychosis again. There's even disgnostic codes that talk about prognosis, one of them talks of having only one episode and being in partial or full remission. 

Best wishes."
