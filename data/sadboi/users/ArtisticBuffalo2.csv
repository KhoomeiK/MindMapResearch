Anxiety,fl97j77,t1_fkrw9c7,1584943786.0,"I've been experiencing something similar for the past few days. I feel like my breathing rate is higher (even though it's only like 14 a min which is totally normal).  This sensation of hunger for air also worsens at night when I'm lying in bed. I've woken up in the middle of the night several times breathless. This has been accompanied on off by chest tightness. It had me so concerned last night that I went to ER because I couldn't sleep. The ECG was normal, oxygen level fine, chest x-ray normal, breath sounds clear. And today I felt faint all of a sudden. Never had these types of symptoms before so have been psyching myself out. No cough and no fevers. I'm a healthcare worker so ended up getting swabbed, now waiting for results. Hopefully it's negative and will help ease these horrible symptoms of what I assume is bad but circumstantial anxiety."
