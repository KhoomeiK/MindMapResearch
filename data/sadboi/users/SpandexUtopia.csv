worldnews,flppxv8,t1_flofr96,1585365610.0,"Do not fear the bat meat. There is no bat meat menace.

A lot of coronaviruses originate in bats; bats bite a lot of animals to feed, usually without killing them. There are often a lot of intermediary species between bats and humans, and researchers don't necessarily know what they were. For all we know, the first human to be infected with COVID-19 got it from cutting themselves while butchering a pig-- Chinese cuisine has a whole lot of pork, after all.

We also don't know that the virus first jumped from animal to human in the market in Wuhan. The first cluster of people to get seriously ill, prompting doctors to test for SARS, were people who worked at the market. But we know that most people with the virus have minor symptoms, so we don't know who was actually the first COVID-19 carrier.

What *is* a huge problem is that the reason we don't know is that the people who were paying bribes to flout the health and safety laws and the people who were accepting those bribes had the chance to sanitize the whole area before researchers could get in there and investigate. Because ""whoopsie"".

Meanwhile, people were literally falling dead in the streets.

This situation happened because of corruption, a totalitarian government, and an oppression of civil liberties so profound that doctors got hauled in by police for engaging in private chats where they exchanged information about the pandemic in order to strategize and get it under control. Not bat meat."

I lost my best friend many years ago, and I felt a lot of the same things that you describe: the dreams, the loss of emotional support, the inability to just eat something. The pain was absolutely brutal, and it lasted a long time. Occasionally, something will still remind me of her and make me sad, but much more often, I'll feel happy and grateful to have had her in my life.

TwoXADHD,fktb1qt,t3_fke0y3,1584512246.0,"The best way to be your own advocate is to not give anyone bullsh*t, and to not take any from anyone else. You need a new GP. You got a diagnosis from the psychiatrist that he referred you to-- what else does he want? If he's uncertain of the best practices for treating someone, there's a database that he can look up. Think of it this way: can you imagine going to a doctor for a toenail infection, who refers you to a podiatrist, and then still won't prescribe you anything when you've got a diagnosis, because he doesn't feel ""comfortable"" because he's not ""experienced"" in the area? It's absolute nonsense.

ADHD is not a mystery. I'm being successfully treated with the exact same medication that has been on the market for this for sixty years. If your doctor is worried about you abusing the meds but won't tell you, there are medications that are impossible to abuse that way. He'd know if he looked.

You have a right to treatment. Don't let people waste your time, especially if they're professionals. You've humoured these goofballs for long enough."

As for Charlotte, she seems to be no more emotionally mature than her daughter, and her consistently selfish behaviour suggests that she and Humbert are made for each other. Humbert can't follow through with his plan to drown her because he's starting to like her. The scraps of her letters that she writes just before her death suggest that her sense of maternal protectiveness quickly turns into a plan to send Dolores to a rough boarding school and a possible reconciliation with Humbert after maybe a year's separation-- when it comes down to it, her daughter is little more to her than competition. For all of Humbert's professed love, he dislikes Dolores' personality, and she will be too old for his liking in a year or so anyway. Humbert is profoundly lonely and Charlotte is his one chance at a lifelong companionship with someone who understands him and accepts him for who he is, because she's as much of a selfish jerk as he is."

She has a crush on Humbert and sometimes flirts with him, but she also gets upset when he creeps on her; she doesn't know where the boundaries should be and has a strong need for a nurturing parental figure, which keeps putting her in danger. The more I read it, the sadder I am for her.

While you can ask yourself as a reader whether you sympathize with Humbert or damn him, I think the more interesting question is to ask yourself how he's trying to manipulate you and whether or not you got played. After all, he's on trial for murder, not rape. It's the 1950s and the sexual abuse was committed in other states and no one knows where the victim is, and he tells the jury to acquit him for murder but instead give him ten years for rape. They don't have the power to do the latter and might be gullible enough to assume that he will face charges for it when this trial is over."
