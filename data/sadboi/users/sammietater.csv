If someone feels the need to have an abortion there would be a fairly high chance that it concerns money. I cant speak for this myself as I've been lucky in my upbringing in a middle-class family, but I have friends who have been raised in that environment and I literally can't imagine having to go through that.

I guess my main argument is a parents love for their child is massive, and especially if they were brought up in poverty, not even just living in it, why would you want something you would end up loving possibly going through the trauma you went through? I guess the idea of even risking it would be too much. Also I know some people who are I'm not even exaggerating scraping by, literally on a few pound a day. It physically wouldn't be possible for them to raise a child without going without meals or possibly not being able to cover rent. They'd rather wait for their safety and wellbeing too, and I don't blame them."
