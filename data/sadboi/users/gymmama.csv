And while we were at my mom's house watching the news, they showed an un-manned rocket or something like that launch from Vandenberg AFB in California, but it failed at whatever it was supposed to do and landed in the ocean.

Thankfully I've gotten much better at recognizing them for what they are, and not getting too scared.  I actually feel comfort when the hand tingling starts, because I know for sure now it's exactly a textbook style panic attack for me.  And I remind myself it's a huge shot of adrenaline that I need to burn off and let it run its course.

I have spent many mornings listening to anxiety podcasts in my car after leaving the gym and my attacks sound 100% identical to yours.

When they start to come on AT the gym (as opposed to after my workout), it really irritates me because I love my morning workouts and I don't want anything like a stupid panic attack to prevent me from enjoying my workout.  But the more my heart rate increases from exercise and panic attack combined, the worse the panic becomes and I end up grabbing my stuff and leaving the gym earlier than I want to just to get the panic attack over with somewhere else with no one around. 

I've been taking L-Theanine 2x a day for maybe 3-4 months now and I'm telling you, they have stopped my attacks in their tracks.

I always carry weight in my butt/hips/thighs and my acne was always cysts on chin, so I figured I was estrogen dominant.

If it were up to me I'd have a dozens of cats."
TwoXChromosomes,fjelxjo,t1_fjehvfu,1583274048.0,"The visual is exactly what I picture when women say that.  It's like they are so proud of themselves for using the word 'vagina' instead of some stupid word, but holy shit they are using it wrong and I don't even think THEY know it. Just say pubic hair. I shaved my pubic hair. Perfect, no misunderstandings there."

Very hard not to correct them every time."
AskWomenOver30,fjefkd2,t3_fcuk1q,1583270952.0,"I explained to my daughters that when I was younger, I would call ""Time"" and ""Weather"" on our landline phone to find out what the forecast was and to find out exactly what time it was if I needed to re-set our clocks after a power outage."
Paranormal,fjdvt30,t3_fcubfb,1583260229.0,"My beautiful Persian, Bailey, who I had for 18 years, and my handsome old-man rescue boy Smokey, both have 'come to me' to show me they were okay.

Smokey gave me the sensation of rubbing across my legs as I sat at my computer on a pet-loss support group, completely devastated at his loss.

Bailey came to me and sat next to me and let me pet her one last time in my dream.

I have 3 amazing cats now and I dread the day they break my heart too, but I HAVE to believe they are somewhere where we'll be re-united again.  The love for them is just too strong to think I only have a physical life with them on earth.

My condolences on the loss of Chester, and I'm glad you gave your other cat a new buddy. I think cats like to have other cats for the most part."
AsianBeauty,fjd9tno,t3_fcr40m,1583248870.0,"I destroyed my moisture barrier years ago. All I can say is I was so uneducated.  I didn't know anything about skin.  And the more I tried to correct the problem, the worse it got. I was in this constant loop of destruction, try to fix, make it worse, despair, self-hate, embarrassed, etc...

I am so happy to say 3 years ago I 100% educated myself and got very into quality ingredients and at 42 years old I finally have the best skin of my life.

Reddit has helped me immensely!"
CleaningTips,fjauvwm,t3_fcd3rl,1583181063.0,"We make a mix of water, vinegar, blue Dawn, little hydrogen peroxide, little baking soda, and a little lemon juice. I don't have the exact measurements on me.

We keep an empty vinegar jug full of it, and we re-fill spray bottles which we keep in the bathrooms from that jug.

It smells gentle, cleans very good, and is very affordable to make!

If you want to make it more basic, go with water, white vinegar and blue Dawn."

AmItheAsshole,fj0j65u,t3_faptbq,1582901196.0,"These women have some real big egos thinking men can't possibly workout near them without being a creep.  I've been an avid gym goer since I was a teenager and my mom had to sign for me to join, and working out with men has never been an issue.

How about make 'women's hour' from 4-5 am.  They can wake up early and fit it in before most people do without inconveniencing others.

Definitely NTA."
HomeDecorating,fiycp6f,t3_fagy0e,1582836874.0,"Since it appears you appreciate a mix of styles, I think you should find two chairs, maybe thrifted, and put them across from the loveseat, and place a small coffee table or two floor poufs or an ottoman (with a tray on it for setting drinks) in the middle.

Also, a throw blanket draped over the loveseat with a throw pillow or two would look nice."
CleaningTips,fixkurm,t1_fiwwlcm,1582822162.0,"YES! I read that too! 

And guess what?  Yesterday we had a contractor working on our house all day.

He needed more light, so he opened up the brand new, white curtains in our living room.  I've only had them up 1 week.

His hands were so dirty from working, and he left black handprints on both sets of drapes (4 curtains total).

I told my husband, ""this sounds crazy but I read about Murphy's Oil to clean pretty much everything and I think we should try it""

So we used a mix of water and Murphy's and cleaned the white drapes.

It was night so hard to see, but it appeared to come clean!  I'll know for sure when I get home today and see them in the daylight."
HomeDecorating,fixggm2,t1_fiw4exd,1582819954.0,"I'm seeing SO MUCH Farmhouse decor for sale on Facebook Marketplace now.  I think people got super excited, went over board  with it, and now they're over it and selling it off.  I did the same but had to remind myself that I love to switch things up and get bored easily so I didn't go too overboard. 

No downvotes here.

I have some farmhouse decor that I still like, but I love so many styles including BOHO and MCM.  I have quite a mix and I love thrifting and finding fun and interesting things."
