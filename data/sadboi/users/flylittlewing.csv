emotionalabuse,fqd8xkk,t3_g8sqp2,1589283585.0,"Yep. My dad. So I’m a grown woman. Have to live at home due to financial troubles. Dad is fucking anal about so much. Like I can’t even sit down without his permission because he has a way he likes to do everything. 

Today I found out he’s been going through my garbage. For “recycling”. Yeah. Creepy. 

I can’t talk to him or confront him because he’s never wrong & im always overreacting. He’s hit me before & although I fought back & overpowered him I still don’t feel safe. It just crossed a boundary I never thought he’d cross. & since then I feel like I have to just pander to his fragile male sensitivities till I move out. 

But I know people have it worse so I feel silly complaining but it’s really affecting me especially in lockdown"

AskFeminists,fpk7ch7,t1_foqepqe,1588689397.0,"Disagree. Depends on how it’s used. If my friend got some action on the weekend we might joke about how she’s a slut but we’re taking it back. It’s in context. I’m not shaming her I’m like “yeah slut! “🙌🏻

It’s like how a white person can’t call a black person the n word. The oppressor can’t use it without oppression. But the oppressed can use it & take it back. 

Sorry if I don’t make sense I don’t mean to offend anyone I’m quite drunk rn."

AskFeminists,foqbzej,t1_foprd9f,1587989682.0,But what if women own it? Like really. Is anyone actually gonna sleep with just anyone? No. We all have our own personal standards. A slut is just anyone that won’t sleep with the guy who’s calling women that. So really when a man calls a woman a slut he’s saying he’s undesirable & she’s in control of her own sexual needs.
AskFeminists,foqbq2g,t3_g8uuyl,1587989469.0,"Depends who it’s used by. It’s like slut (which I wear like a badge of honour) or the N word (which I wouldn’t say cuz I’m white af, but love that bla(c)k ppl are owning it). It’s all in the context really."

I stepped on a raised brick on the floor. Turned out it was a button. The floor opened up & a space ship emerged inside the pyramid. The space ship opened & out came a family of lions. They were friendly & we got to keep one each. I took mine to school & it scared some bullies. That’s it."

Because it’s all a diverse spectrum, we can often feel ok. It’s in These times that we question. And also because of the invisibility of it, other uneducated people can sometimes think we’re faking things. And of course often that can cause a kind of paranoia in us. I also get migraines & I worry that people think I fake them because again they are invisible."

herbalism,fl1jttj,t3_flxmxi,1584730421.0,Not an expert & I haven’t tried all those but i think it depends on how fresh or dried they are. I got some dried lavender that I don’t think was fully dried & it was potent! Like too much eyes watering potent. Damiana is nice but I like it better as a tea with other herbs. Relaxing.
