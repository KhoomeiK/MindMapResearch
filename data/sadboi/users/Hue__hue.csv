leagueoflegends,flnyw3h,t1_flnpls5,1585328491.0,Clash has nothing to do with the instabilities in the past weeks on EUW. They are seperate from clash due to high load or whatever
leagueoflegends,flnyhov,t3_fpyef6,1585328277.0,"Typical PR talk, nothing new. 

No mentioning of the burning EUW servers ANYWHERE, nothing. No communication from Riots side or anything.

Riot really doesn't give 2 shits anymore."
leagueoflegends,flnyc3a,t1_flnvetf,1585328195.0,"Yep, that PR talk of this guy is pretty insufferable."

No Problem there, but then they release qiyana for the same tokens as the Riven skin without any announcement beforehand. You had 2  weeks for the Qiyana skin when you got the Riven skin. I still feel betrayed about that shit because I woulda gotten Qiyana over Riven, fuck that shit"

leagueoflegends,flkv13y,t1_flknz17,1585248206.0,">here used to be jokes about how they would constantly give compensation to NA players for mild inconveniences, but EU would be unplayable for a week and they'd say ""sorry for the inconvenience"".

That wasn't even a joke. It was reality."
leagueoflegends,flkus1u,t1_flkfacv,1585248069.0,"The mods delete 90% of negative posts anyway, because ""muhh repetitive"", which is bullshit. They are too busy sucking Riots dick and riding it all the way to Tencents headquarters."

leagueoflegends,flktxr0,t1_flk5e8j,1585247620.0,"Yeah, it's incredible. The only servers Riot cares about is NA and China/KR.

Even though NA is a lot smaller than EUW."
leagueoflegends,flktsle,t1_flk1alm,1585247544.0,"they really want to raise the bar for the Prestige skins? 

They are getting more and more pathetic."
