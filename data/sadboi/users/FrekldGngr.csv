ptsd,esn3fqt,t3_c7qumc,1562121637.0,"I like the other tips you have been given. I would like to add another. One that offers me a jolt when I need it, rather than relaxation grounding. I keep a rubber band on my wrist for snapping. I go to my freezer and grab frozen veggies. I keep sour candy in my car and pop one in if needed. These give me a quick tap on the shoulder to bring me back to center."
ptsd,esn30cm,t3_c7fqs8,1562121344.0,I feel this so much. Thanks for posting.
ptsd,esn25f1,t3_c8arc8,1562120766.0,Yes to the stuffy nose! I'm not sure if it's the Prazosin.. I haven't paid much attention.
