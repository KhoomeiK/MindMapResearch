The govt capped the amount shortly after it came out. The only way I think the “with conversion” even remotely makes sense is if you’re doing a cash advance on a shit credit card with high fees, but you shouldn’t be doing that anyway. I just use my debit card and it’s a 220 Baht fee ($6). With conversion costs $15. Also I get out large amounts once a month, so I only pay the 220 Baht once.
