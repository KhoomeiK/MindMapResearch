Divorce,fgzbjed,t3_f0u1sf,1581192616.0,I relate with this so much it hurts. I feel like I'm reading my current situation only my spouse hasnt been served yet. Everything from the sex.. to the not wanting to have kids with them.. feeling like it's a child parent relationship.. loving them dispite all of this and worrying about if they will be ok. Even when you know this is right for you and you need and want more in a relationship then this.. some one who understands you without having to bend over backwards.. and not have to worry about these emotional life wracking triggers. My heart goes out to you so much.. you arent alone. Thank you so much for sharing.
Divorce,fgz61pf,t1_fgxyw9c,1581191121.0,Sounds like someone is not being very sympathetic to the fact they still love them... and they are hurting.  Not cool man.
Divorce,fgz5uve,t3_f0p3eb,1581191053.0,This brought tears to my eyes because I feel like what you just wrote is what I hope is in my  husband's heart right now.. with all that he has put me through and were we are now. Right on the cusp of getting a divorce and he still says he loves me and wants to work it out.. but none of his actions and words match up. However I feel like this would be his words..after all is said and done and it breaks my heart because I do still love him so much. Yet someone can only go on so long until there are no other chances to give... You at least have been able to say these things.. even if its here. I agree I would talk to a therapist and see if it would be wise to send this to her now.. so at least you would have closure. Life is not over.. things may change over the years.. but the fact you see these things now.. is far beyond what most can ever say they did at this point in their lives.

It could also be said as a way of containing the situation and making sure the other parties anger is not allowed to derail the situation. It's a de-escalation technique used widely and I have to use it many times before both at home and even at my job in some cases. People are easy to fly off the handle.. and upping their voices.. switching topic to divert the attention to other things... is all a form of manipulation. Sounds like honestly your spouse might have been taught to gas light at one point or another, but good on you for standing firm and not putting up with that.

bipolar,fc1siv4,t3_efphj4,1577328342.0,I have a kylina(sp?) IUD implant. I had mood swings with it at first..for the first few weeks. Then it leveled out and has been fine since. I warn though to have your cervix checked BEFORE getting it implanted.. to see how supposedly easy an IUD will be to be put in. For some reason mine is what is called crooked a bit.. and they had to open mine about 10Ã— wider then normal to put it in. It was the worst pain I have ever had..and I have had my ear drums burst..wisdom teeth removed.. ribs dislocate. For 90% of women they have little to no issue and it is very easy.. I'm just unlucky.

bipolar,fafa3gb,t3_e8xn68,1576017831.0,"A little background info here.. I'm bipolar type 2 and have 3 cats and 3 dogs. 2 cats I raised from little kittens...none were kittens at the same time. The dogs I raised 2 from 8 week old pups, that were puppies at different times. The other was a year old with some bad habbits.

Having animals helped me majorly.. however the difference in WHEN you introduce an animal into your life and being ready to fully take on that eddition to.. is different. Especially for those of us who have Bipolarism.

I say this because kittens and puppies come with a large amount of happy feelings that can counter act depression. I mean.. hell..they are cute.. sweet.. goofy..all the good feels. However they are still babys..and they wake up at night.. need consistent attention at times.. need to be taught what's OK and whats a NO NO. Potty training and getting through the midnight crying for puppies. Kittens rough play and their nocturnal play( up all night nature) come with the territory.

They do grow out of these things... it can help by wearing em out by playing a hell of a lot before going to bed. Honestly getting the kitten a sibling to occupy it's time can help a ton too... because they will entertain one another. 

If they pounce on your feet.. or run all over you.. put on a thick blanket over the part of your bed that lays on your legs. You could take the kitten to a Petsmart groomer and have their nails trimmed so they wont hurt when they pounce. 

I would say the first week or so IS A MAJOR ADJUSTMENT.. bipolar or not, however you need to do what is best for you. If you need to sleep you need to sleep. The kitten needs to know its sleep time when you sleep.. and they will get in the groove.  Will just take time. =)

Hope that helps!"

bipolar,f93hjhz,t3_e3h3s1,1575059216.0,"So, I would highly suggest contacting your human resources at the company. There is a law at least in the USA called the ADA. American Disability Act, that requires employers to make particular accomidations    requested by you in coincidence to your condition. In order to be accommodated.. such as being able to have your job protected if you have to randomly not come in one day because you are having an episode.. you have to inform your employer you have a disability in the first place. The human resources handles those accommodations and informs your managers of them so you dont have to worry about doing so... but they dont give specifics about your condition.  You can choose to tell them you have a condition..and can choose to tell them what ever you want to give.. but you are not required by law to disclose any of it. If they press you for it.. IE your manager.. they are breaking the law and invading your privacy. I hope this helps."

bipolar,f8zr1a8,t3_e2qm8w,1574963972.0,I like this tattoo...for a few reasons. Being Bipolar is not somthing that goes away or fades in time. It's a burden we shoulder..that we didn't have a choice to have. Yet this tattoo's colors remind me of what we go through.. that just like every dark and terrible storm..no matter how fierce or long it may last.. the Sun and a blue sky is always behind it. Though even the Sun may burn if we arent careful.. with mania and hypomania. In the end they must pass. The rainbow is us.. what shines in the rain and the Sun light through these struggles. I'm proud I choose to go on day to day..  just as I am proud of each and every person here who chooses to take on a new day. Be proud of living on with this burden we never asked for.. and proud to stand together..not broken..but different..and that is why I like this tattoo. It speaks to meâ™¡
bipolar,f8wu5lj,t1_f8wrtdx,1574900014.0,Yes I did.. She said it sounded like it was linked to anxiety and stress of me returning to work after 6 months leave. I did admit it made me wanna throw up thinking about it...She also made sure I hadnt hurt myself.. and asked when it started. She put me on Latuda.. 40mg.. gave me the 20mg test pack too. Upped my Lamictal.. dropped off my Seroquel entirely. Dropped my Pristiqu from 100 to 50mg..refilled all my other prescriptions. She said the Latuda should help keep me from rapid cycling and nix the mood swings too. Being on 2 mood stabilizers I figure has got to help some how. I'm just hoping it will help me sleep most of all... I think that will help a ton..and the nightmares. .

relationship_advice,f8vjdc3,t3_e29med,1574870771.0,"It sounds like she has severe trauma in the past of perhaps her privacy... more likely her physical or mental self being violated long before you both got together. Her projecting the blame on you is for sure uncalled for, and not right.. its miss directed. You live in the same house.. are husband and wife.. there shouldn't be any issue if you were looking for somthing in a drawer of her's. There shouldn't be any secrets in a marriage anyways, not a healthy one... I know from experience that this only leads to disaster. 

You giving her the divorce papers could very well be the wake up call she needs to finally take her mental health seriously.  Not everyone sadly is able to ""snap themselves out of it soon enough,"" to save a marriage per say.. but some times it is what is called for to get the person save the person themselves.  You have been with her a long time now, and seem to have already been put through a large amount of strain and stress over this. Divorce doesnt happen in a day.. it takes time to process..and for things to fully be finalized. If I may suggest.. while this is going on... I might tell her that she needs to check herself into a mental health program of some kind. There are plenty of programs that are not fully inpatient.. such as PHP.. Partial Hospitalization, where you go to group settings for 5 hours a day. They work with therapist.. psychiatrist.. to find the root of their behaviors.. trauma.  It normally takes 30 days or so.. and they can come home at night. Maybe give a slight ultimatum?  That if she goes through this program.. you both can meet together and see if this is truly what's best. If your relationship can be salvaged.. and couples therapy after that... If they wont go even that far at all.. Well in my mind.. I can see that you have to take care of yourself.. you are responsible to people.. not for people.. but first you are responsible to yourself. Living in misery for the sake of anyone...even an SO... is not right. I hope that helps some sweets."

1. Sounds like you found your identity in the role you play as a spouse.. and a mom..but have no clue who you are as a person and no respect for your OWN self anymore. If you did you wouldnt be letting yourself be treated this way.. You are a woman with a heart.. a Mother of children with hearts too.
2. Sounds like you were taught to play this role by someone else.. perhaps your mother.. or were slowly  gas lit over time.. who knows...but it sounds like it  came from somewhere. 
3. Seek mental help. This IS NOT HEALTHY nor mentally sound that you feel this way. It comes from some kind of abuse.. twisted mindset.. or jacked up train wreck of thought that led you to not feel. Get help. I suggest trauma counseling. 
4. You both had children.. you both chose to be parents.. he needs to check the hell back in just as much as you. A healthy home life for children cant come from toxic parents.

TOPIRAMATE 100 MG TABLET
Once at bedtime(For weight loss, doesnt work)

Seroquel 50mg 1x at bed time(For sleep, doesnt work. HATE THIS SHIT. Made me gain 40 lbs in 6 months AVOID AT ALL COST!)

Alprazolam 0.5 - ( 1 to .5 at night to sleep or as needed)

Once daily (Mood stabilizer)

BUSPIRONE( generic buspar)HCL 15 MG TABLET- by mouth x 3 a day. (Anxiety)

Naltrexone 50mg 1x daily(Booze and food cravings)

.....I'm seeing my Dr on Wednesday and demanding she put me on Abilify or somthing else other then Seroquel that wont cause weight gain. She only puts me on it for sleep... no other reason. There are other things I can be on. I gained 20 lbs last time she put me on Seroquel..and she put me on it again. I have stopped takin it and lost 6lbs in about 2 weeks... so yeah.
