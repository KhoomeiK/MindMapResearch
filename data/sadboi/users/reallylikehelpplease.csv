SuicideWatch,ew5uc2q,t1_ew5t700,1565145298.0,"I guess no one gets being valedictorian, year ahead in math, so much potential, and a mother do everything to destroy you. She stole all me dreams, it’s disgusting. But ppl just say buck up. I know I have a degree, but really management. It pays you just as much without one. You don’t need a degree to move up in management. I literally slept through classes, not really they’re just that stupid. And ppl pay that way too. When I could be making 50k. Idk. Idk y ppl don’t see a mother stealing a future as tough, I would care about a person saying this. Idk. The worlds fucked anyway and I lived a life fucked by my own mother. If I die it’s like my pain will stop, finally won’t matter no one validated that what I went thru sucked. Idk thank you. I wish reddit sponsored therapists on here to help. Thank you though. Go do something nice for you.  And stay away from evil ppl, but thank you"
SuicideWatch,ew5tsyc,t1_ew5t700,1565144915.0,"Ya it was thanks, that’s why I struggle tho cuz I have no one. They’re not empathetic, it’s like the weight of everything being ok with everything that’s happened to me is on me. But thank you for talking with me. I can at least go thru and read it. I’m not sure if I’ll make it. Being abused so much, I don’t feel life is worth it anymore. I didn’t get why people who were abused felt like this but I get it now. I’m hoping my therapist might help. I’m trying to hold on till then. If not, thank you for talking, don’t let bad people mess with you, it really does fuck you up permanently"
SuicideWatch,ew5slwx,t1_ew5rwij,1565144070.0,"Not just tendencies. We need some narcissism to survive. I fall into self neglect, being narcissistic like caring for your appearance and teeth are important. Some people are more into themselves. People with the full disorder though have no empathy. They destroy lives and hide it, and are good at it too. They lie cheat, as she has and does. They’re very destructive. They say it comes from lack of love as a child and they act like toddlers their entire adult lives.

Anyway you said “people like her” online, I’ve heard you should go “no contact” with the narcissist in your life, or if u must be in contact very regulated and minimal contact because they will try to emotionally manipulate you and begin their terror in any way they can. They like having emotional control over victims, and freak out when they don’t because of the person possibily revealing their lies to others. They’re honestly scary. My ex is one. He abused me and continues to stalk me and says he should’ve done worse when I was nearly knocked unconscious, and claims this wasn’t beating."

SuicideWatch,ew5rd05,t1_ew5r0xf,1565143192.0,"Ya unfortunately but I keep my distance as much as possible to nearly no contact, things online say to do this with people like her, I think it helps I’m just really struggling despite it tho"
SuicideWatch,ew5qv6v,t1_ew5qfq0,1565142851.0,"She hasn’t. She insists she never forced me. She has a personality disorder. She cheated on my dad incessantly and is a pathological liar, all while pretending to be Christian. When I got herpes she said “well there’s one down!” Acting like I was a whore who deserved it. It was my first time being with someone at 23."

SuicideWatch,ew5q4tb,t1_ew4smiz,1565142346.0,"Thank you for commenting and asking. It used to be just living at home bc my mother forced me into a degree which makes nothing when I was a year ahead in math and wanted to be an engineer* sorry. Now it’s the age and outcome of that, living with low income on the brink of loosing my job w Uber (I’m sure my car won’t pass inspection next week and today it’s shows signs of shutting off at stops) so now it’s being so old with no success, and many more years of struggling to get a good degree for success, and having no kids, having only an abusive ex and being unable to think. It’s mostly being a nobody when I’m smart, being broke when I’ve tried so hard, and having a mother who put me here and bets on my not making it. I think she’d be happy secretly if I died. She could say the issues were just mine and I’d finally not be around to call her the liar she is.

Thank you for asking. Typing it out helps, I’m trying to hold on till therapy I don’t know how to stop the want to die anymore"
SuicideWatch,ew4oiac,t3_cbk8i7,1565114979.0,"Yes, i have herpes and seriously thinking about ending it. I’m 28 and my only real bf abused me. Now I have both strains, and I’ve had every good work opportunity stolen from me cuz I’ve always looked “ok” but had a shit mother always tell me to not try in life. Idk why I’m still breathing."
Herpes,evxb0wg,t1_evwg60i,1564886963.0,But do you kiss their body?
Herpes,evvtuk4,t1_ek5fs1s,1564847209.0,Do you refrain from kissing someone’s body? I’m struggling with depression a lot and feel I can’t kiss and play and have fun or be happy. I’m gonna get therapy cuz I’m really bad off but wondering about kissing
SuicideWatch,evv88sd,t1_evrs73l,1564824764.0,Does anyone at all think I’d edger find love. Sex seems impossible now. I mean it fucking is. I can’t even do anything without fucking spreading a virus. I’m not a fucking saint. I’ll have to go around pretending like I’m above it but fuck. I can’t kiss. Can’t go down. Fuck. I mean kissing anywhere on a body is prohibited now too cuz that can spread it anywhere even if there’s nothing on my lip. Why not just throw this whole body away.
SuicideWatch,evryr67,t3_ckyqae,1564722975.0,"Look my own mother said “Well there’s one down!” In response to me getting it down there
It’s harder for me to deal with and I’m trying, but my parents didn’t even let me take sex ed 

I don’t even want to try to date for the rejection and disgust 

I don’t want to fool myself a guy would even try and just be let down till I settle for who will take me I know I’m talking to myself but this is a vast improvement from the insanity on my mind morning noon and all night long these days, talking to myself with a hope of a response is better than inability to think or move or do"
SuicideWatch,evrwlje,t1_evrs73l,1564720826.0,"Thank god for reddit, I at least get moments of ignorance is bliss from getting to speak my truth even if it’s total ignorance that goes back to hopeless, at least I get to feel some feelings even if mostly bad, if someone believes there’s actually a chance for me, not a pity marriage.. idk I’ve never felt good enough for marriage anyway, I’ve abandoned my oral health so I’m kidding myself someone would like me, I’d have to continue to not smile cuz anything less than Colgate mouth as yellow as mine is is just hideous these days, so just not smile and settle for whoever will take me and never be happy or feel or care again.
I don’t like this life. I think it’s evil. And I’m tired of fighting it. It’s stupid to say I’m ok or smile. It wins u know. For me in all, evil wins"

SuicideWatch,evrsrd9,t1_evrs73l,1564717381.0,"I mean it’s not curable that’s what I have to tell guys, even with antivirals a guy can get it from kissing me when not there through viral shedding. I don’t want this to be the case but I would need to be honest with him and myself to help my conscience, so I’ll still feel like a walking virus in any relationship 

I’m just being 100% honest I’m not trying to be mean but this is what I am now"
