Getting caught at 7km because you were stealthy enough before that radar turned on is a death sentence for a destroyer.

WorldOfWarships,fr41gzj,t1_fr407bz,1589872617.0,"As far as I'm aware the first ship to spot another ship holds the spotted ""token"" until it loses sight on the ship, or one of them dies. Only the ship holding that token gets spotting damage. This means a destroyer has to rush very hard to grab that token on ships in order to get spotting damage and they may have to stay exposed to keep getting xp this way.  


If we did away with that restrictive system and allowed spotting damage to be assigned to every destroyer that's in spotting range of an enemy getting hit then they wouldn't have to rush so hard and would still have an incentive to spot."

WorldOfWarships,fr3zdit,t1_fr3q4fq,1589870721.0,"Not to be a dick but I'm on a mission to help DD players avoid CV damage. Are you aware the American tech tree carriers have a horizontal oval as their rocket reticule? 

This means that while other carriers would hit you hardest if you are running at them or directly away, the US carriers would hit you the weakest. The biggest advantage the reticule gives them is to make slipping the rocket reticule very hard if they approach from the front or rear. Indeed you open yourself to more damage in trying to evade.  But if they approach from the side you can slip most of, if not all, the reticule by throwing the rudder hard at the right time on their approach. Usually somewhere around 4.5 - 6 km out. Of course nothing is guaranteed because a bad player could make a large adjustment and balloon their reticule or a good player could do it on purpose but it's less damage than it would have been.  


And of course the biggest thing is to head for the closest large friendly because they categorically have better AA than a DD."
WorldOfWarships,fr3yrsu,t1_fr3qn1a,1589870189.0,But that requires near suicidal behavior to make sure you get the spotting token for that ship too.

WorldOfWarships,fr3ygx5,t3_gmcsl9,1589869923.0,"Destroyers aren't great spotters or cappers in the early game anymore. Radar, CV's, and accurate long range HE fire have obliterated that ability. Like it or not in a non CV game cruisers need to put some skin out there and spot. Because if I do it in my DD, you're going to cry when I drop a smoke screen and run away from the hilariously large torrent of HE spam that comes my way.  


And no you can't spot without being spotted, not unless you're playing kagero and even then there's very little margin of error. This is because we aren't the only ones with destroyers. So shockingly, it's usually another destroyer that spots the spotter.  


Destroyers in the current meta are nothing more than torpedo boats and anti-torpedo boats in the early game. In mid game it depends on the situation, and in late game they get their old school utility back. But they aren't making it to late game if you waste them for 15 seconds of spotting at minute 17."
