mentalillness,fhx64ss,t3_f57rt3,1581945858.0,"Don‚Äôt!

All I needed was to believe in myself! It‚Äôs okay to be tired or need a break! Here is what worked for me I simply took a break and stepped back for a bit, evaluated my life and rearranged it! Here are the steps I hat worked for me, try them maybe it helps you. If it doesn‚Äôt help you what‚Äôs the harm in trying.
1- take a break from work (a week is good)
2- for the first couple of days do stuff that relaxes you (sleep ‚Äúat least 10 hours straight at night‚Äù, after sleeping watch a couple of movies ‚Äú choose something you love if it‚Äôs action or romance or documentaries‚Äù just chill)
3- after the couple of days wake up early and go to the gym if you don‚Äôt have a membership just go for a long run or even walk (listen to music or something loudly just get the frustration out) try doing that at least two times (morning and night)
4- when the fourth day comes around go to a quite coffee shop and take your laptop with you, open a page and make a list (things you want in life, places you want to go, things you want to experience) after making the list prioritize and divide it. For example this week (a new restaurant you want to go to, a membership to the gym, and hangout with a certain friend you haven‚Äôt seen in a while), put a goal (this year I‚Äôm going on a vacation to search for a place even if it‚Äôs in the next town ‚ÄúB&B seems nice‚Äù for example) that would give you motivation to look forward to.
5- fifth day start putting your plans into motion (call your friend, search for your vacation plans and etc).
6- for the last two days hype yourself up (going out even by yourself, sightseeing or to the gym, think about your plans).
7- after the week is done go back to work and every time you feel overwhelmed or low do something on your list (at least go to the movies once a week, go to the gym three to four times a week, see your family or friends at least once a week too) you need to look forward. 

With these steps you have taken a break for two days, blew off some steam, put your needs and wants into a list then prioritized them, put your plans into action and motivated yourself.

If this doesn‚Äôt workout you need to get help! When you overdose that my end your suffering but you would be causing so much hurt and heartbreak for those around you, even if they weren‚Äôt close to you they would feel pain because that‚Äôs how humans are!

Sorry for the long comment, hope you feel better soon! I‚Äôm sorry for not being able to do more!
I don‚Äôt know you but I really care about you!
Take care of yourself! Lots of love üåπ"
BipolarReddit,fhtotad,t3_f4s9ns,1581876531.0,"Mental health is tricky, in physical illness the doctors can estimate how long the recovery will take at least. I‚Äôm bipolar and I have had severe breakdowns which resulted in suicide attempts. I was supposed to start studying MBA but I decided to take a year break, I didn‚Äôt work either, just took sometime to get myself together. During the year that I took as a break I went through really bad situations. But I survived them, I‚Äôm studying MBA now it‚Äôs stressful. I literally was crying a couple of hours ago, but it‚Äôs going to be okay. My advice to you is your mental health is as important as your physical health, so I‚Äôm advising you based on my experience take a break and when you feel like you can continue with you studies go back to school!
