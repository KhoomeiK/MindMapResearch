puppy101,ewrwne8,t3_cptwv7,1565715354.0,I didn't read your response. I don't care about this. You're insulting a stranger on the internet. I deleted the post so I don't even know how you're still commenting on it.
BPD,ewrsly4,t1_ewrqlqy,1565712855.0,Thank you for the perspective. It is greatly appreciated.
puppy101,ewrplc2,t1_ewrnuxg,1565710934.0,"Yes I could have googled it or read reviews on Amazon. I never said I didn't have time to do that OR that I didn't have time to buy dog shampoo OR that I wasn't going to buy the dog shampoo. But this is also a forum for asking questions and finding answers,  just like google or amazong, so I chose to use this one. Isn't that what it's here for?"
BPD,ewrng6q,t3_cprybt,1565709547.0,I totally feel this. If my FP says goodnight and then is still active online after it makes me so mad. Do normal people ever experience this?
puppy101,ewrmvya,t1_ewrml2o,1565709174.0,Thank you. Do you have a favorite brand?
puppy101,ewrmovb,t1_ewrluw8,1565709046.0,"My problem is that I'm being told what I did is unsafe, and then being recommended to use something harsher, which doesn't make sense. So I now don't trust your advice. It is just illogical that a high surfactant detergent would be safer for your dog's skin that a sulfate and paraben free hand soap. 

I'm really baffled by this whole thing.  

Was really just looking for a ""my puppy stinks too, I use this soap and love it"", or ""here's a home remedy I like"". I'll just Google it."
puppy101,ewrlm11,t1_ewrle2r,1565708342.0,"I'm hearing the ""buy dog shampoo"" argument loud and clear. And am not against it, like I have stated previously. But none of you actually answered my question. And your arguments don't even make sense. Why would I care if you downvote me?"
puppy101,ewrlct0,t1_ewrl5n1,1565708175.0,Yes it would be very easy to buy shampoo. But that wasn't my question.
puppy101,ewrl5x6,t1_ewrkui8,1565708051.0,"Yes because it's heavy in surfactants,  like an engine degreaser.  That's why it's good at removing oil. I don't want to strip my dog of all his natural oils. That's the opposite of what is good for him."
puppy101,ewrl12i,t1_ewrkpe5,1565707962.0,"And your issue was with the soap not being ""safe"". But then you said to use dish soap, which is extremely harsh and closer to engine degreaser than it is to dog shampoo. I'm just not following your logic."
puppy101,ewrkwkf,t1_ewrkpe5,1565707882.0,Dish soap has far more surfactants that a sulfate free hand soap and would be MUCH harsher on his skin.
puppy101,ewrktf5,t1_ewrkp35,1565707825.0,"Well, yes, obviously,  but are they actually different or is it just marketing to get you to buy a different kind of soap for every purpose? I'm sure they're all made by unilever and are basically the same."
puppy101,ewrkke7,t1_ewrkhkb,1565707660.0,I'm not against it. I just didnt have any. What are the differences between the two?
puppy101,ewrk5vu,t1_ewrjuuf,1565707392.0,Why would hand soap not be safe but dish soap would?
puppy101,ewrk3c6,t1_ewrjnng,1565707344.0,It's a lavendar soap.
puppy101,ewr2i8c,t1_ewqp24z,1565691490.0,"It's either they're locked in my bedroom or locked out,  or else no one is sleeping.  Before the puppy they were locked out of my bedroom as much as they were allowed in depending on how spazzy they were each night."
BPD,ewe0uqb,t3_cnmhdg,1565311883.0,Totally get this.  Just got a pup and I care more about him then anyone in the world.
BPD,ew7suns,t1_ew7s6ue,1565196687.0,Yeah if I didnt live in a small apartment I would get a big dog that would go for runs with me every day.
BPD,ew79bsd,t1_ew6gvi9,1565188231.0,"That makes sense.  I also feel like dogs are emotionally complex enough that you can feel connected to them, but still simple enough that you never have to guess what they're thinking or about to do, like people."
BPD,ew60d8w,t1_ew60bk6,1565149980.0,That's awesome.
BPD,ew60awl,t1_ew602ue,1565149928.0,"Those are two of my favorite breeds. Especially Dobermans.  They're so elegant and noble,  but also goofy and loving af. That's a future dream for me. My babies a little speckled dachsund and he's so sweet and silly. Really the perfect size and temperament for where I'm at right now still in an apartment.  Someday I'll move to the woods and get all the dogs, big and small. And also chickens."
BPD,ew5yoj4,t1_ew5y7ee,1565148602.0,Thank you. This is encouraging.
BPD,ew5yh9h,t1_ew5xdh0,1565148441.0,"Thank you.  This is encouraging. I really have felt so much better just spending an hour a day with him the last 2 days. And I read that dachsunds are the best breed to be anxiety and depression therapy dogs. I feel like it would really help me to have a focal point for my love where I don't have to worry about what I'm getting back, or them leaving me. But I feel like that's somehow unfair to the animal? Idk I feel guilty for some reason."
BPD,ew5hcjc,t3_cmu7tp,1565136293.0,"Yup. And now that we broke up just looking at pictures of him makes me ache, and the thought of seeing him with another woman makes me nauseous."
BPD,evzgtyo,t3_clwokq,1564957280.0,100% I'm in hell right now with no relief.
BPD,evu4tg1,t3_cl6jkw,1564785681.0,I completely feel this. I got nothing. I dont remember anything before adulthood. High school friends are mist. Last week is also cloudy.  Stuff in between is super clear though?

BPD,eu5u9xj,t3_cesmkx,1563485498.0,"I totally get it. Sometimes I say I'm just waiting to die. I'm not suicidal, I won't do that,  but I'm ready to be done, and dreading the next 50 years of this crap."
BPD,eu298eb,t1_eu28y50,1563385071.0,Thanks!
BPD,eu26bbs,t1_eu25uxv,1563383275.0,To be fair part of my problem is that I'm a manipulative people pleaser that morphs into the thing you want me to be before your eyes.  So it's possible that I did that.
BPD,eu25c82,t1_eu242ls,1563382663.0,I have not been diagnosed with BPD. I came across bc I thought my SO might have it and then over time realized I have BPD traits as well.  There aren't a ton of mental health resources where I am. I found someone who does EMDR and that was helpful but she doesn't diagnose. I dont want to be labeled anyway. I'm just trying my best to learn coping mechanisms and love myself.
BPD,eu254ga,t1_eu242ls,1563382530.0,I asked. He said he doesn't feel like it's place to comment on something like that but anything that I would do to improve myself can only be positive.
BPD,eu1zwib,t1_eu1zs1q,1563379251.0,Respond in what way?
BPD,eu1ypmr,t1_eu1xai5,1563378500.0,"No. I was in therapy for a year and my therapist said she thought I had learned some good coping mechanisms and sent me on my way. I read a lot of psychology textbooks and adhere to a pretty strict sleep, diet and exercise routine."
BPD,eu1x8dc,t3_ce9lse,1563377551.0,"This is the main problem in my relationship.  I have taken care of him through countless meltdowns, hospitalizations , getting his wisdom teeth taken out. I helped him process his divorce before me (I really relate to the playing therapist line). He slit his wrists in my apartment once and I came home to ambulances.  

But if I get depressed for more than 2 days he can't handle it.  I need too much attention apparently.  He tells me I'm volatile and my behavior scares him.  I don't even come close to acting out the way he does.  It's so fucked up and yeah it makes me furious."
BPDlovedones,etgz0n5,t1_etgycay,1562801960.0,"Ok. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.  I think after years of having a best friend with BPD and a boyfriend with BPD maybe my standards are lower? I was just proud of her for attempting to use I feel statements, lol! Thank you for explaining."
BPDlovedones,etgvbhp,t1_etgum2t,1562799643.0,"My girl friend and I share an account . She has BPD and I don't.  We use the account to learn about how to deal with our relationships and discuss what we find.  I'm truly just trying to understand. There's no need to be rude. 

If she spoke through her feelings with me this way, I would be super proud of her, so I was surprised to see such a negative response. I was just trying to get some perspective, since it seems I am the minority opinion here."
BPDlovedones,etgtxwl,t1_etgorxj,1562798796.0,I thought gaslighting was when someone tried to make you believe something you know to be false
BPDlovedones,etgtv3r,t1_etgorxj,1562798747.0,"But if she was in fact upset by her family reacting to her choice of clothing with judgement and negativity, aren't her feelings valid? Is she not allowed to seek support?"
BPDlovedones,etglgl5,t3_cbigu3,1562793596.0,Can everyone explain to me what is wrong with her texts? She seems to do a pretty good job explaining her feelings and calming herself.
