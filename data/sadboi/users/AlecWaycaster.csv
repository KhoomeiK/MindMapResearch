I dont know anymore, really. I am transgender. My family is what I treasure the most so the very thought of disowning them makes me feel like a monster. I owe them so much. My Mom works hard all her life to provide for me and she loves me more than anything.

I know that I'm of the choice to transition on my own once I graduate from highschool and go away for university. But then I cant keep it a secret anymore. Everyone will know it. My family may (very likely) cease to like me. And I dont want to put any extra burden on Mom.

She did some mediocre drawings and other kids complimented her ceaselessly for them. I, of course, couldnt stand it. So i proceeded to ""pick up drawing"" by copying fanarts and designs online (i know, it is shameful). The kids began to pay attention to my copies more than hers and at the same time I discovered my scope for sketching. Still, copying is just copying. It never was my art. After a couple years of copying works, i decided to abstain from that and actually took up anatomy study to actually create art of my own. I work on sketching humans and sceneries every day, bit by bit. Now, after almost 10 years into practicing, I am doing commissions, sometimes for some major events and organisations in my area. Looking back, I'm grateful for that girl and our enmity."
