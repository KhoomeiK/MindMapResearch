In BP2 it's generally seen that Lamotrigine is pretty effective for preventing relapses, both into manic and depressive episodes.

Not because the substance itself is necessarily bad, but because we should be working with professionals to reach our goals and find stability. 

Substances that are currently sectioned as controlled substances aren't automatically bad. There are studies into using psybosilin for treating depression, MDMA in a therapeutic dose as a tool in psychothetapy with PTSD patients.  This doesn't mean go out and take these substances yourself. It might not be medical quality, it might not be the correct dosage, or any other number of issues. Exactly the same way as you wouldn't start self-medicating with Prozac without consulting a doctor. 

I think cannabis is a bit more complicated. Usage is growing, legalization is slowly gaining traction. It may help people, and the fact it's accessible makes using it as a therapeutic tool easier.  But there are studies linking those predisposed to Schizophrenia developing symptoms in conjunction with drug use.  Drug use is associated with higher rehospitalization rates across the board.

Hypomania is highly varied. It is classified, according to the DSM-IV as being in a state of elevated mood for at least 4 days.  Decreased need for sleep is one example of an expression of the ""elevated mood"".  What is keeping you awake?  Is it racing thoughts? Is it physical restlesaness? Are you preoccupied with other tasks?  

The best thing to do is talk to a psychiatrist.  Hypomanic symptoms can escalate into a full-blown manic episode if left untreated. You can develop psychotic symptoms, too. This puts you and people around you at risk. 

Your brain requires sleep to regenerate cells and maintain function. Prolonged lack of sleep causes brain damage, can contribute to delusions and hallucinations. There have been cases where patients died due to prolonged lack of sleep.

A psychiatrist can even refer you to a sleep study, where the professional team can break down what issues are leading to insomnia. Because there's a fine line between ""decreased need for sleep"" and being ""unable to fall or stay asleep""."

An important lesson I learnt for myself is that other people don't need to see what I am going through for it to be real.

I can have a bad night, self-harm and then still meet my friend for coffee in the morning. You can smile and still hurt inside. You can cry and still see the beauty in dark places."

I want to start by saying that you're still pretty young in terms of receiving a diagnosis. A lot of symptoms only start emerging in your twenties and onwards, so it's hard to tell at this stage. 

The way we understand Bipolar is changing. It used to be thought of as Manic Depression, and was identified in patients with typical manic and typical depressive episodes. But there are variations to the disorder. For example Bipolar II, in which people experience a less intense form of elevated mood, hypomania. It is less severe in a lot of ways but can still be damaging. 

There are also different types of depressive disorders. 

Ultimately, the process of diagnosis is pretty subjective. There are guidelines, such as the DSM. But it comes down to how you interpret and how your practitioners interpret your symptoms. It's not a super exact science. There are overlaps in different diagnoses, especially with something like depressive symptoms. 

At the end of the day, your diagnosis is what you make of it. It can be a life sentence, it can be a meaningless label, it can be a starting point for finding the right treatment. Even something like Lithium can be used as an augmenting agent to improve the effects of an anti-depressant. Lamotrigine can be safer for someone who may be predisposed to Bipolar disorder. 

It's your diagnosis, not your dad's. I recommend finding the psychiatrist that works the best for you. Maybe someone who specialises in young adults. You get to decide. Who understands you the best? Who do you trust to help you get control of your life? 

Good luck!"

BPD,fbxeudd,t3_eexg30,1577183697.0,"I think that the whole ""manipulative borderline"" trope is a bit of a fallacy. It doesn't really look at what is going on behind your behavior. There's such a negative connotation to the idea of being manipulative, but I don't think you're doing something inherently bad. 

BPD is a byproduct of emotionally volatile, abusive and unstable environments. The way you adapted to your surroundings, how you learnt to interact with otjee people isn't necessarily a bad thing. You aren't really acting with malicious intent. You don't want to take advantage of people. It's not really manipulation, it's just functioning in survival mode. 

If a child gets hurt and cries, they aren't manipulating their caregiver into helping them. They're communicating the only way they know how, or the only way they see in that moment.  Over time we repeat the same behaviors again and gain and they become a part of us. This is what a ""personality disorder"" is. Our behaviors are destructive or disordered, but we've been using these survival methods for so long that they're integrated into who we are. 

I wish you the best of luck on your journey to recovery and learning new ways to interact with yourself and the world around you. I hope in the new year you'll find peace, and go from surviving to thriving."

You're not a monster. You're in control of your behaviour, not your feelings. Your emotional reaction to something isn't inherently good or bad, it's about what you do with it. 

Your time will come. You're on your own path and what everyone else is doing is irrelevant. When we let go of comparing our lives to everyone else around us, then we can discover who we really are.

I think it comes from a disconnect between the mind and the body. Our bodies often stay frozen in the moments of abuse. Even though our minds know that it's over, even though our minds want to pursue relationships. Our bodies, rather than experience the new connection, experience past pain. 

So then you feel these feelings of shame, regret. The desire to flee. Because our body can't recognize that this is something different. And then our minds process what our body feels, and we take those feelings and are conflicted.

I'd say talk to the doctor ASAP and find the minimum medications you can take for the best effect. It'll change with time, you'll need different things at different stages.

About 5 years ago, I was hospitalized for the first time. I was a wreck and my life was crumbling around me. My best friend and I got into an intense physical fight, she called the police and I gave my wrist a nasty scar.  She messaged me in the hospital that she was done. She was moving out, of our apartment and my life. If she saw me on the street she would ignore me. 

One nurse said to me: If she doesn't stay, she was never really your friend. 

I couldn't imagine that at the time. But 5 years later, I know this nurse was right. When you have an unhealthy, dependant/codependent relationship you aren't really friends. 

With effort and luck, you'll find some people who accept, love and appreciate you. People who would never blame you for your struggles. You will find unconditional love.

As someone dealing with BPD, you're constantly at the mercy of the world around you and the different elements of the self. You feel more intensely, for better or for worse. This means that the actions of other people constantly drive you to extremes, which can leave you feeling lost and confused and exhausted. 

Physiologically, the BPD brain appears hypervigilant. Constantly engaging the flight/fight protocol, which puts the body into emergency mode. This stress on the brain and body leaves a physical mark, essentially brain damage. I say this to emphasize the realness of the disease. 

Wanting to withdraw, wanting to run away - these both can seem like solutions to that feeling of being so impacted by the world around you. Being on high alert all the time, constantly being pulled emotionally in different directions, losing your sense of self.

BPD,fbad0wb,t3_ecb9a4,1576674521.0,"BPD mood swings differ from Bipolar style mood swings in a variety of areas. There is generally a real or perceived trigger. Mood disorders are characterized as episodic, whereas something like BPD is more prolonged. 

The other symptoms of BPD are also crucial to diagnosis. It's not a mood disorder, so the factors such as impulsivity, substance abuse or selfharm are important. Borderline traits reflect how someone responds to stimuli in the world around them - how they manage their relationships, their self-identity. When it impacts your life negatively, we can start to see it as a disorder. 

Someone who has experienced abuse, neglect or other trauma in the formative stages of development are more likely to develop the disorder.  If you've experienced these things, speak to a professional as soon as possible. There's no reason to wait until you are eighteen to seek help. 

Also keep in mind that BPD has an extremely high comorbidity rate, this means it more often than not accompanies another disorder. Such as a mood disorder, an anxiety disorder or a psychotic disorder.  

If you feel that the mood swings, and other common symptoms, are impacting your ability to function - seek help immediately. The longer you wait, the worse it can get.

There are better ways to cope and it just makes it worse. You're young and if you play your cards right, can have a satisfying future. 

Your mental health is important. 
You are important."
BPD,fbac2qd,t3_ecbkbv,1576673612.0,"Your mental health care professional knows best. 

In my experience, different medications impact people differently so it's hard to know. What works for me, may not work for you. 

I would recommend trying to understand your mood swings. Is there some kind of trigger? How long do they last?"

Racing thoughts, difficulty staying on one topic, less coherent stream of consciousness 
Increased sex drive
Increase in risky behavior - overspending, gambling, alcohol and drug use 
Decreased impulse control 
Irritability"

BPD,fb9qjea,t3_ec658p,1576646286.0,"BPD is intertwined with past trauma. I think that sometimes our relationships mirror past traumas. For example, when you have an abusive parent you learn ""splitting"" behavior. You experience both love and hate as a way to reconcile the intetnal conflict. 

But it doesn't have to be this way forever. You are entitled to be in relationships that don't make you feel this way. If you feel that meeting this person was ""the worst thing"" that happened to you, it's probably not a healthy relationship. 

Don't put the blame on you! It's not your perspective of the relationship that's wrong. You don't have to take pain and pleasure together. You deserve better."
BipolarReddit,fb9q3mo,t3_ec5ed5,1576645870.0,"Go to the emergency room, call emergency services, reach out to someone who can help you. 

Suicidal ideation can quickly evolve into an attempt. Even if you think you aren't actually going to do it, you're drinking alcohol which lowers your inhibitions and affects decision making. Something unexpected may trigger you and you can fall over the edge. 

Sending love and support, special soul."
schizoaffective,fb9ox6q,t3_ec7rfo,1576644774.0,"First off, you have to speak to a doctor as honestly as you can. Because without telling them what you're going through, they can't help you manage your symptoms. 

There are overlapping traits and symptoms for all different mental illnesses. A psychiatrist is trained to understand the subtle differences and help direct you to the best treatment. Your family history, background and other factors are as important as your current symptoms. 

Psychosis can be a result of trauma, drug abuse and a whole plethora of things. Only a professional can really work with you to understand where the symptoms are coming from. 

Psychotic disorders can look different in different people, mood disorders can look different in different people. They can be related or unrelated - you can experience psychotic symptoms as part of a depressive episode, you can experience elevated mood with no psychotic symptoms at all. 

I think rather than look to fit yourself into a box, try to reflect on what you experience without judging yourself. If you're in a place to identify what you're experiencing, you're already ahead of the game.  

And most importantly if you think you're unsafe, if you think you are a danger to yourself or others, go straight to an emergency room or contact an emergency service."
bipolar,fb9o2is,t3_ebze27,1576644013.0,"I think it's important also to realize that bipolar comes in many forms.  Someone who is experiencing extreme rapid cycling, or extended episodes may attribute more to their illness. 

There's also a lot of comorbidity, diagnosed and undiagnosed. Especially with non-episodic diagnoses like Borderline personality disorder, certain types of Schizophrenia, anxiety disorders.  Something that isn't episodic doesn't have that same idea of ""Oh, now I'm stable"" because medication is only one part of the equation, even with more textbook bipolar disorders. 

There aren't cures, there are medications to manage symptoms and lifestyle changes. Also there are medications which carry difficult side effects which, while addressing one issue, can cause another.   

I don't think it comes down to overanalyzing and attributing every small thing to Bipolar. I think that there is a huge amount of people on this sub, with many different representations of a bipolar disorder. If a post speaks to you, great. If not, we're all different."
BipolarReddit,fb7g000,t3_ebb08w,1576588814.0,"I don't like olanzapine. I had severe psychosis about three years ago. Was hospitalized after a suicide attempt. They gave me injections of zyprexa, three times a day. As well as 2mg injection of lorivan three times a day. I was so sedated. This continued for a month before I was switched to tablets, and it took another month to get released."
BipolarReddit,fb7f7ur,t3_eblvk2,1576588057.0,"Adding on to some other comments, abilify and olanzapine are very different antipsychotics chemically. And they can be used differently to combat different symptoms."
BipolarReddit,fb7ex4m,t3_ebn4i9,1576587757.0,"Agreeing with everyone here who want to break down stigma. I didn't have much of a choice at one point because I had a very public breakdown. 

Now all the people in my life know, to different extents. Most of my friends have severe mental illness because I've just found that we are an amazing community."
BipolarReddit,fb7e0vs,t3_ebq92e,1576586841.0,"This is so relatable. I wear makeup everyday no matter what. Even when I was in the closed ward of the mental hospital, I still did a full face of makeup."
BipolarReddit,fb79pn3,t3_ebrdaz,1576581582.0,"Alcohol is pretty nasty for our brains. As said above, most alcohols are depressants. So if you're feeling depressed, it can make the situation much worse.

It doesn't interact well with psychiatric medications, in some cases chemically cancelling out the effect of your medication. 

Alcohol also lowers your inhibitions and decision making ability. If you're already feeling vulnerable or depressed, especially if you're grappling with suicidal ideation, it can put you in an unnecessarily risky situation. 

Just don't drink, is a lesson I learnt the hard way. I've had my stomach pumped countless times, I've triggered psychotic episodes, I've harmed myself and others and destoryed property. I know this is probably more extreme than what you're experiencing, but using an addictive substance like alcohol can spiral out of control really quickly. 

Especially over the holiday season, stay safe! Know you have us, and I'm happy to talk any time - day or night."
BipolarReddit,fb79amm,t3_ebqpfk,1576580972.0,"Definitely not a waste of time, thank you for sharing that. 

Some illnesses emerge in early adulthood, some illnesses worsen with age, stress, change. So just because you were diagnosed with depression for example, this doesn't mean it can't change with time. 

So bipolar disorders are a category of mood disorders wherein the person experiences extreme mood shifts. Which are traditionally called mania and depression, and Bipolar disorders used to be called Manic Depression.  

A mood disorder is typically episodic. Have you experienced episodes/periods of elevated mood? It looks really different for everyone, but you can take a look online to see if any of the descriptions of mania or hypomania speak to you. 

I recommend downloading a mood journal, so you have something concrete to bring to your counselling service in three weeks. It's something you can do right now to start working on your mental health. 

If you want to ask questions, discuss further I'm happy to be a sounding board."
