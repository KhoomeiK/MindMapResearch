houseplants,fp5gpcj,t1_fp53ofq,1588328740.0,How long did you wait to water it again?

AskMen,fngojpz,t1_fng07uh,1586939174.0,Aw.. Why did you guys break up?
plantclinic,fnbdm24,t1_fnbbteh,1586813658.0,"Alright, then I'm going to wait:) Thanks again!"
plantclinic,fnbd0yf,t1_fnadxnl,1586813364.0,"Nice! Good thing you got those away, always best to be able to feel the soil when checking if it needs water:) I hope it'll thrive again!  
With this plant my experience is that it likes to get dry between watering. So always feel the soil before you consider watering it, and let it get dry before adding water again.  
What kind of pot do you have it in? It's best to have it in a pot with drainage holes. Without them there's a bigger chance of overwatering and root rot."
plantclinic,fnbbbow,t1_fnah364,1586812507.0,"Thank you! I'm definitely going to take the dead stems out. The unhealthy looking top part is due to overwatering unfortunately. Been in doubt wether to take it off and prop it, or to keep it on for now.   
I just repotted it because it was overwatered, moved it to a new location, and I'm moving house in 2 weeks. So it'll get a lot of changes/stress in a short time.   
Not sure if it'll handle cut off parts now, or if I should wait until it's settled a bit in my new house. What do you think?"
plantclinic,fnabo4e,t1_fna89xk,1586794650.0,"Thanks for your reply, really appreciate it you taking the time for it! I'm sorry, I used the wrong word haha. I meant stems instead of roots. Should've been a bit clearer, I'll try again:   
What I mean is if it'd be better for the plant to take these stems:  [https://imgur.com/a/KTrcw1y](https://imgur.com/a/KTrcw1y) off, or if it's okay to keep them on and let them grow big. I really like how it looks and would prefer to keep it, but maybe it'll weaken the main stem too much. Everything still looks good so far though.  
The other option is take them off, hopefully let them create their own roots, and then put them in the soil to grow on its own.   


And about the pot size; I thought so too! It was in a similar sized pot before this, but the root ball is pretty small. It's got more than enough fresh soil around it to let it expand more. You can see it a bit in this picture: [https://i.imgur.com/KgqLVOo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KgqLVOo.jpg)"
plantclinic,fna68ct,t1_fna5xi5,1586791806.0,Put it in the soil so it can grow as a seperate stem along with the others:)
plantclinic,fna614y,t3_g0i6s8,1586791698.0,"Those 2 stems  with the black spots look rotted. Can you squish them a bit or do they feel firm?  


\*edit:   
 I'd suggest to cut them off (preferably with good pruning scissors). Try to look for a point where it doesn't seem dead anymore, cut it off until you hopefully find a point where it's still got some healthy green in it.  
It seems like at least of one of those patchy stems is still healthy near the bottom, around where that little hole in the braid is.  
For example here: [https://i.imgur.com/7Kl1cEt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7Kl1cEt.jpg)  
You'd want to cut off the whole dead part, until you've only got healthy green stem left.  
If the whole stem is dead; cut it off until the base, and try to get most of the dead stuff out of the soil/roots"
plantclinic,fn9kgth,t3_g0grue,1586776409.0,"Forgot to clarify: The young stems on the bottom are growing out from the side of existing big stems, so they aren't coming out of the soil.  


\*edit: meant stems instead of roots"
plantclinic,fn4r8p1,t1_fn41dhm,1586647238.0,"Alright, I just repotted it. Hoping it'll go well.. The plant probably got quite a shock from the removal of lots of soil. Didn't know about not putting it back in the sun, good to know.  
Thank you for commenting, really appreciate it!"
plantclinic,fn3xytv,t3_fzdeyb,1586630121.0,"Hi guys,  


I took the plant out of the pot, got most of the moist soil off it, and am planning to repot it into a terra cotta pot with drainage holes.  
Should I keep the plant out of the pot for a while to let it dry completely? Or will that dry out the roots that stick out?  
The soil isn't soaking wet (anymore). Should I instead put it in the new pot already with new soil?

Some extra info:  
My roommate overwatered my money tree plant. A lot of leaves are starting to discolour, there already were some yellow ones too which I took off.  
The plant has been on the same location inside for years. It was doing great until I noticed the leaves a few days ago. That happened in a week I believe, before that it was fine.  
I suspect the discolouring leaves are due to the overwatering. Perhaps combined with getting much more sun because of the sudden nice weather here.
