Conservative,fohvtfp,t1_fnhw11n,1587773621.0,"His message isn't about supporting the establishment; if you watch anything he's said that's what it's always been about to a certain extent. Goal 1 was to become the POTUS and enact change, goal 2 was to make sure Trump isn't reelected. During the primary both goals required the same action of pushing through the primary and now that he's dropped out and goal 1 is no longer attainable it would be against Bernie's character to just throw out his whole message and ideals and so we continue with goal 2. 

Bernie has always said he considers Joe a friend, much like with the other opponents in the primaries. If Trumps handling of this pandemic has been an indicator of anything it's that realistically Trump isn't fit for office and doesn't have the sense or empathy to run this country. You may not support Joe, and the DNC in indefensible, but Trump is an active danger to American citizens."

Bernie got a majority of support from people 18 to 44; unfortunately younger people don't vote in the numbers that they should and 62% of the votes were people over 45, a vast majority of which supported Biden. 

Only 247,072 people aged 18 - 29 voted. There are 643,839 people just between the ages of 20 to 24. So approximately only 15% of people 18 to 29 bothered to go vote.

Furthermore, while most people agreed with Bernie on issues; a majority of people that voted stated that beating Trump was their primary concern and that they believed Biden was the better option in that regard."

TrueOffMyChest,fc7yixm,t1_fc7lluf,1577522043.0,"I don't disagree with that, my point was more to separate the argument between the decision to join the military and smoking and drinking.

Furthermore, I said that they CAN learn those traits in the military; I never said that there were never any negative traits or that they HAD those traits already going in, hence the emphasis on LEARNING those traits once they're in. I even said ""ideally"" in recognition of the fact that doesn't always happen. (CAREFULLY reading the entirety of other's posts helps when crafting responses so as to not waste your time on a moot point). 

So you didn't really make a counter argument more just a random statement that didn't really have anything to do with what I said but that doesn't mean it's a bad point or wrong. I just want you to know that if your goal was to disagree and make a statement to feel like ""you were right and I am wrong"" then you failed because your statement did nothing to disprove anything I said."
TrueOffMyChest,fc774dc,t3_egh01v,1577499315.0,"In my personal opinion if an 18 year old makes the choice to enlist in the military they can, and ideally will, be trained in dedication and discipline and proper respect for a firearm, other people, and responsibilities.

Your average eighteen-year-old right out of high school doesn't have those traits, generally. A lot of them are learning what long-term repercussions of their actions are and how making their own decisions is not as easy as they initially believed.

Many young people don't have the foresight to understand how something like smoking will affect them for the rest of their lives and they can't conceive of their future if they begin doing so, the same is true for drinking. With age comes experience and an additional three years after leaving their parents home does nothing but give them more time to learn how to properly utilize their freedom.

Making the choice to enlist in the military and making the choice to ruin your body with alcohol and cigarettes are not the same thing and people really need to stop acting like they are.

Vehicle insurance rates drop as you age because studies show you become more conscientious and responsible over time. The age of consent is over a certain age because children cannot conceive of the manipulative nature of others and the long-term ramifications of their actions.

There are very few people I've met who began smoking that weren't peer pressured into it as teenagers and spent the rest of their lives trying to quit. Now these same people are saying that because they went down a certain path and made certain decisions others shouldn't potentially be given the opportunity to veer away from that path via lack of availability.

If you were coerced into smoking cigarettes at 14 and then left your parents house and had to make your own money and pay your own bills at 18 and cigarettes weren't something that you could go into any gas station and get freely perhaps you would have quit by the time you were 21."
