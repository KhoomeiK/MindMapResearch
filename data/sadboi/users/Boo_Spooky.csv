BPDmemes,fmf1wcu,t3_fu9njg,1586018275.0,wow didnt ask to be attacked lmao
BPD,fm1pxc7,t3_fsfvpz,1585682891.0,Yes !! I just want people to love me and pay attention to me. It’s mostly specific people I work with. I’m actually a lesbian but there’s a particular man I work with who I want to want me but I have no emotional or sexual attraction to him whatsoever lol. I’m also currently trying to steal his girlfriend :)
BPD,fm1pjxq,t3_fsii9i,1585682695.0,"I go through phases of hating everyone and not wanting to talk to anyone (because I feel like I’m better than them and I they’re opinions don’t matter) but then it always cycles back and I’m begging for their attention. So yes, but it doesn’t last that long."
BPD,fm1p779,t3_fsj2fl,1585682514.0,"I can relate to this high key and she’s probably aware she’s doing it. If she’s like me then she’s using you as a person to talk about her problems with and could be annoyed when the focus isn’t on her (this is me assuming things) but I can’t be certain. This isn’t me really giving you an answer to your question but more so explaining how she feels (might feel). But if you haven’t already done this I would recommend just telling her exactly how you feel without giving her the chance to interrupt whether it be in person or calling her and telling her what this post says in that you need to be heard and your feelings are valid but you aren’t coming from a place of annoyance/hatred. Basically, you can’t do much more than be honest regardless of how she reacts."

relationship_advice,fj890kh,t1_fj88puw,1583107848.0,Yeah I was thinking that but a number of my friends have pointed out that they think she likes me and she will always stare at me every so often when I’m in the shop

BPD,fdby59x,t3_ekdjm9,1578263679.0,"Yeah I can only remember a few events from my childhood, all of my earliest memories are traumatic and I have a lot of big gaps up until the age of 13. When I  moved house for the second time around the age of 10, I remember nothing about living there aside from abuse and a pool table collapsing on me, leaving quite a big scar lol. I think my brain has blocked out a lot more traumatic memories which is quite scary and makes me feel uncomfortable as I'll never fully know what happened. Also, for the past year or so, I find it hard to remember stuff that happens recently and all of my days blend together."
mentalhealth,fb6cvcg,t1_fb6cgi9,1576547150.0,"I’ve no reason to still be depressed and to be self harming so idk why I do it, so I don’t think it’s a problem.

mentalhealth,famgw72,t1_fame10h,1576203567.0,"Wow are we the same person? Lol. I also have lack of self preservation (doing drugs, starving myself etc). This somehow gives me real comfort by showing that I’m not not alone in the things I got though. Honestly, thank you. I feel like I’ve been understood for the first time in a long time even though you know nothing about me, just thank you."
mentalhealth,famgdli,t1_famdzbd,1576203220.0,"Honestly that’s why I smoke cigarettes, combined with alcohol they give me the ultimate (legal) numbing feeling which is what I strive for unfortunately."
mentalhealth,famdr0k,t3_e9wsam,1576201415.0,"Cigarettes in general are comforting, it’s kind of the effect they have, especially in times of high stress. But this could definitely be exacerbated by your connection to your father."

Illness when you don’t, it’s a sensitive topic, I just find it interesting."
mentalhealth,famcsnj,t1_fambi9k,1576200809.0,"I really relate to your response, thank you. Mental health awareness has really progressed over the years, but on the downside there are people who glamorise it, and use it as a way to seem ‘different’ I guess. I agree it seems insulting, but I don’t really understand why I find it insulating as the opinions of others don’t really matter to what goes on in my own head. It’s really an interesting conversation."
mentalhealth,famawa3,t1_famaou8,1576199789.0,"But if it’s so common among adolescents, would they really be classified as having some mental imbalance or is it attention seeking behaviour?"
mentalhealth,famah6g,t1_fam9pzq,1576199499.0,How do you figure that?
mentalhealth,f61n3b5,t1_f61k641,1572642865.0,I did a few online tests (let’s assume they’re accurate) and all of them have said I’m a type 8 followed by a type 5 so you would be correct.

BPD,f1c0ct3,t3_d8qb1s,1569347039.0,"Oh my god yes. Specific noises make me extremely angry. For example, the sound of tvs in my house, my brother playing guitar, people eating and talking what I deem ‘loudly’ (not really that loud). It mostly only happens in my own home but can happen in public if it’s actually very noisy, such as at school where there is a lot of people. It’s why I listen to music or watch YouTube/Netflix with my headphones for most of the day when I come home in the evenings. It can be really frustrating, it makes me clench my whole body, punch the wall, shout etc. It also makes it really difficult to sleep because it’s not completely silent, therefore I end up falling asleep around 1-2am, leaving me with just over 5 hours of sleep a night :)

Edit: I forgot to tell you how I deal with it - I don’t"
