AskWomen,fpn896s,t3_ge1tsm,1588753665.0,"I hope nobody I know sees this, and nobody ever figures out anybody‚Äôs identity. So like a bunch of years ago I make friends with this guy and I date him for like really no time at all before I break up with him. I had also became friends with his friend, and his friend had this gaze that saw you, saw the world and saw through you more than anyone. We hung out a lot, talked about a lot and went for meals together many times but just as friends. He intrigued me but I thought I was just having an intrusive thought (pure ocd = having weird fantasies and thoughts about random people/everyone) so I just go about my way, he‚Äôs just an acquaintance. We stay acquaintances because we have a lot of mutual friends, most of which I knew through him. We wish each other on birthdays and holidays, we text occasionally when there‚Äôs something to talk about but nothing much. This whole time, he stayed stuck in my mind, giving me some sort of butterflies and a heart attack every time I hear or see his name or face which also triggers memories and a long train of thought each time. Honestly think I‚Äôm a little obvious sometimes when I instinctively act a little loopy around him like puppy-dog-would-do-anything-for-him but nobody has figured me out apart from teasing comments that have been directed at so many guys that it is just a meaningless joke. Never said anything, never gonna say anything, I‚Äôm very close to one of our mutual friends and we talk about him a lot but he doesn‚Äôt know so I must be doing a good job. But damn if that boy does some shit to me. (Just to be clear I am still unsure if it‚Äôs like a recurring intrusive thought but at this point after so long I kinda just accepted it lol)"
