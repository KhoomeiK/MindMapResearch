Muse,fq5t5pg,t3_ggqaj2,1589116768.0,Dream is Collapsing by Hans Zimmer?
Muse,fpwo58d,t3_gfxd95,1588966895.0,I guess the Simulation Theory Tour Ost that Matt talked about in Instagram will be included in this? Wondering if there is new music in it...
Muse,fprwviz,t3_gf7evz,1588863572.0,"I think is a good song, but could had been better. Specially cause the song is really short. The whole song  feels like it keeps building into a climax but then it ends and didn't go to anywhere. Matt really needs to write longer songs again!
Saying that, I loved the sound of it, hope it inspires him for the next album!"
Muse,fpelrpw,t3_gcvbto,1588550011.0,"As everyone says, Radiohead. You can try The Bends and Ok Computer. Both great albums... My favorite songs of those albums are My Iron Lung, Just, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien."
Muse,fp6tsvo,t3_gbexic,1588358468.0,"Yes! Back in 2007 I was so into metal, and I was playing with a friend who decided to put this song called Stockholm Syndrome by this band named Muse. Was a mind blown experience, and still my favorite song ever."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fortnog,t3_g928dw,1588018316.0,"Tbh I stopped caring about games after the GameCube era. Some years later, I remember my brother was excited cause he got to buy a rare game back in 2012 or 13, like a treasure you wouldn't get later.... Then I watched him to play a bit to see what was the excitement about and holy shit, I was surprised by the first cutscenes. I paid him half price of the game so I could play it and here I am! Tbh I finished the game the first time without knowing how the combat worked, but the story blew my mind"
Muse,fop0ph9,t3_g8kc7g,1587950515.0,"Dont know if it counts, but after one their concerts in Mexico back in 2013, they went to the crowd to shake hands, and I was excited cause I was in first row... So when I saw Dom I screamed at him and shaked his hand, and he looked at me but I felt his wtf face pointing at me. I never felt so judged in my life! I laugh now so I wonder if I screamed like a kid."
Muse,fjoeqc4,t1_fjoe7pw,1583526273.0,"Of course not! I also think is a good song, good guitar work, I just find the chorus a bit weak."
Muse,fjodmbo,t3_fegvnq,1583525640.0,"The demos are definitely the highlight for me. Some are good, some are shit, but is nice to see how some songs changed through the years. Connect the Kettle Lead and Good News are way better songs than stuff like Overdue or Coma so hard to guess why they were forgotten for years

And that demo version of Do We Need This? is top tier, much better than the final release."
Muse,fjod6y8,t3_feiemc,1583525395.0,"Interesting, why they would take down the song after all these years? Last time they did that, was with all the Newton Abbot Demo songs in youtube prior the release of Origin of Muse.. Maybe an upcoming compilation of unreleased songs??? If I remember correctly, in an interview from 2018 Matt was talking about including Soaked in Origin of Muse, with more unreleased songs. So who knows! But sadly I expect to be nothing of that."
SuicideWatch,fjfv58c,t1_fisc0k4,1583301178.0,"Pretty much, life is so fucked up"
Muse,fi5e1yr,t1_fi4vnir,1582161014.0,"I know that, that's why I mentioned Weakening Walls in the known songs. My point goes to songs like Phaze, Freeze, Bathtub. E"
Muse,fi4micl,t1_fi4919a,1582144176.0,"Yeah, I was quite shocked when I saw Muscle Museum was written back in 1995. Even that, the song managed to survive the early years all the way to Showbiz and became an instant classic. Shame we can't hear the other songs there."
Muse,fgeehqh,t1_fg5dwqk,1580697701.0,"Tbh, Prague production makes me avoid the song, if only they recorded it another way,  but the end vocals are amazing. Not b sides but what about the songs that are in the This is a Muse demo? Backdoor, Sling, Feed, and Jigsaw Memory, tho full songs hasnt been released yet, but you can tell how much they changed over the years"
Muse,fg21fqf,t3_ewbpg5,1580436430.0,"So the band where Matt plays bass posted the same image, I think they play covers? What if the score is songs by them? Lol"
Muse,fg20dfi,t1_fg1256m,1580435954.0,"Maybe behind the scenes stuff? Maybe is similar stuff to Hullabaloo ost but now with new music. Who knows ! Let's wait and see, hope is a looooong score."
Muse,fd4ys9a,t3_ejp84y,1578172495.0,"Oh, my favorite songs from those sessions. The only reason I can think of is that Matt felt embarrassed about those two, specially about his past vocals, Forameus last part feels quite awkward when he sings. Maybe the same reason why they only added short instrumentals of songs like Backdoor and Cut Me Down. But who knows!"
Muse,fcv9gaa,t1_fcuyicb,1577997418.0,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QwBlqn6LKwg I mean, is not Muse but here you have"
Muse,fcuy8hr,t3_eixost,1577990908.0,"I saw those a while ago in the Warner Chappel page, but it seems those are just former names of some released songs, but why is the reason to copyright early names????
There is one named Forse which is Unintended with Italian lyrics, you can find it on YouTube."
Muse,fc4mflf,t3_eg45bn,1577421020.0,"I wonder if they are preparing something, or this was just recorded for instagram, but would be nice if they release piano versions of some songs"
Muse,fc0h7gr,t3_ef4n9g,1577290771.0,"Do they talk anything about the early songs/demos and why they haven't released those? I saw there is a setlist with names like "" Phaze, Blues""... I wonder if they mentioned those songs in the interviews!"
Philippines,fbsyhfn,t1_fborwtq,1577063568.0,"Nop, planning living there next year! so any advice is good!"
Muse,fb6oms5,t3_eb7jn5,1576555567.0,"I know what you mean, did you go to Mexico gigs by any chance? idw, but the bass was so loud and couldnt hear anything of the guitar! Great song but I thought they had sound problems with the song those concerts"
Muse,fa7pgjs,t3_e72ugd,1575836949.0,"Has the interview of OOM being uploaded into somewhere? I wanna read it, or this apply as piracy too?"
Muse,f9v9l9t,t3_e72ugd,1575665531.0,"Idk you guys, but I think Connect the Kettle Lead is a great early track, even better than some Showbiz bsides. Also, I don't think the hidden track is scrapped riffs, more like part of some demos, considering the second snippet is Cut Me Down ( maybe Matt was embarrassed of the way he sings in those demos so they only showed some parts). But that was a great listen! Definitely good material there."
Muse,f9upruk,t1_f9unbla,1575655486.0,Any way we can listen to this ? cause i dont own the box set.... are the snippets from those 1994 videos in youtube? this is a Muse Demo?
Muse,f9uhtiz,t1_f9tu7p6,1575651076.0,"I  wanna listen to Connect the Kettle Lead, Good News and the alternative version of Recess, shame I can't hear those yet"
Muse,f9qw3vd,t1_f9qt3zi,1575567784.0,Can't wait to hear them! Hopefully someone leak them soon haha
Muse,f9qebcf,t3_e6idh5,1575559726.0,The obligatorily question... Are Good News or Connect the Kettle Lead unreleased songs or just known songs with former title names?
Muse,f9ntb45,t1_f9nsgu3,1575490326.0,"Yeah! Should be fun to listen those songs now in better quality. I was checking YouTube now and all those songs were blocked! Except Falling with the Crowd and Forameus, I guess Good News and the Kettle song are maybe unreleased stuff!"
Muse,f9ns9l0,t1_f9njrmd,1575489827.0,"I think those are the Newton Abbot Demo songs, Showbiz demos, and the OOS instrumental demos. Like, not really actual unreleased songs.

Which is a shame, I was actually expecting them to release "" This a Muse Demo"" in full. 

But at least we are getting Connect the Kettle Lead and Good News but somehow I think they are Falling with the Crowd and Forameus renamed."
Muse,f897ad1,t1_f8914ag,1574368259.0,"Yes, sounds like Prelude in g minor by Rachmaninov... But more than a "" cover "" I always thought they tried to built a song based on it, just as they did with Space Dementia and Rachmaninov Piano Concerto... Also sounds like the interlude section of Grand Omega Bosses version of Assassin."
Muse,f80fua1,t1_f7zhx3l,1574128038.0,"I really hope there is some hidden material in there! Unlikely but at least we got two new demos, Good News and Connect the Kettle Lead"
Muse,f7zd4p1,t3_dy58nx,1574108936.0,"Are they releasing too those 1994 videos or is just part of this promo? Wonder how many songs they wrote in the early days : "" Tending to Lie""? ""We all hate you""? ""About""? a shame they are not releasing the ""This is Muse ""demo, I have been always interested in those shitty early songs"
Muse,f4ynynp,t1_f4xtedc,1571880981.0,Good luck!
Muse,f4wq8e3,t1_f4vbe43,1571858816.0,Haha! You should give it a try! Maybe you will be rejected but you won't lose anything I guess? Hope all of them get leaked haha
Philippines,f4p006o,t1_f4m47c6,1571712369.0,"Thanks! Is this a bad idea? I really wanna do it, so any advice is welcome!"
Muse,f24i9er,t3_db3ne0,1569952709.0,"Hard to tell, I have seen Muse three times but in another place ( Palacio de los Deportes). Tbh I don't it will matter but you should ask once you are there, and if there are many queues don't try to risk to going to Acceso A, cause that will make you lose your chance to get barrier. Plus everyone wants Matt's side so I am definitely picking Chris side to get a good spot haha. I am also going alone in October 3, I am planning to arrive at 3 am so I am up to a meet up, I am so shy and dont wanna be alone for many hours !"
Philippines,f1xejyl,t1_f1tkgug,1569797299.0,Hopefully soon to be the second Mexican haha

It's great to see Filipinos share some positives messages on here!"
Philippines,f1qjtdk,t1_f1oo8bx,1569702158.0,"Thanks! Definitely Manila reminds me to Mexico city, crowded and all that stuff, so I will look for something more calm haha. I have those cities in my radar, will do a bit of research to see what I like more. What about in Pampanga! I know some friends there"
Philippines,f1qjdor,t1_f1om1q1,1569701987.0,Thanks! It's easy to get a job as a Spanish teacher??? Or I do need like a course? What cities are the best options to get a job! Thanks!

Philippines,f1qinwr,t1_f1ol3sy,1569701499.0,"Thanks! Last question, what are the cities I should look for opportunities? Let's say like working in call centers"

Philippines,f1oisiy,t1_f1oi1l9,1569647226.0,"Yeah! The country feels so familiar to me! So I will try, at least for a year! And yes, telenovelas are still a thing here haha"
Philippines,f1oip50,t1_f1ohz1r,1569647121.0,"I have some Filipinos friends, they always get mad when I tell them they look like Mexican. And yes, I am aware of their Spanish past, and that's why they have Spanish names. That's why I am picking Philippines over other countries, because the country is so different and yet feels so familiar. What about jobs! What you can recommend?"
Philippines,f1oikds,t1_f1ohhb3,1569646975.0,Thanks! Are you also a foreigner?
Philippines,f1oiig2,t1_f1oi7zd,1569646913.0,"Hey that's good to know haha, cause I can't live without tacos"
Philippines,f1oi6l5,t1_f1oh7zk,1569646540.0,"Thanks! I am aware that speaking Spanish could be helpful to get a job! But for some reason I feel wrong having this kind of job you know, because I feel is better helping in small communities, like teaching music ( I studied music)... It may sound stupid but if I will live in another country I want to be useful, leaving a mark in there, not just going to make a easy living. But I guess I can do that in free time?"
