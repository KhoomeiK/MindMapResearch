hiphopheads,f96ofv9,t3_e3y58q,1575148874.0,"I am a long term avid Earl fan and this album was amazing from a biased standpoint. Veins and The Bends were the highlights of the album for me. Seeing him perform this set live as well, OnTheWay! was easily my favorite. Him live is better than him in the studio because the passion just leaks out of him. As far as the album goes I'm not too crazy about Red water and Loosie as I felt Red water was almost a repeat of Shattered Dreams in terms of the beat and how it was set up. Loosie is still good, but I can see how how off beat that particular song is, could throw people off. Peanut and Riot! was pretty much a prime example of poetry/art in rap. Riot was sampled from his dad/ uncle (I can't remember which). You can just tell by the raw grittiness of Peanut that he's almost desperate to impress his family's seemingly high standards ( ex: ""family saw you on the stage, left it not amazed""). Proceeded by the intense beat switch to Riot it almost sounds like a triumphant tone, but still depressed at the same time. I love the album, I love Feet of Clay and Earl is a legend. People don't get his music (not trying to be a hipster here, I am a huge Earl fan so what do you expect), but people don't get it because one, he picks beats nobody else would think of to rap over (ex. EAST), he is offbeat on purpose sometimes and he is monotone in most of his studio recordings (almost like a dream song set up for people with Major Depression due to the uniqueness which sometimes is combined with isolation, the feeling of being different which leads us to liking different shit most people don't and on top of that the lyrical content and its delivery; this music is made for people with mental disorders. Either way this album helped me a lot and if you suffer with depression/ mental illness please reach out."

You're basically looking to set up your house so you can get everywhere in the game and be able to bring your stats back up if they're reduced.

There is a wiki page for ultimate ironman and under construction it should tell you what holds what and the level/supplies you need to build that item. Still big for normal ironman too bc let's say you build a jewelery box, then there is no need to enchant that kind of necklace ever again.
