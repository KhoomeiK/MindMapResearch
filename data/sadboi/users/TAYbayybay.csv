mentalhealth,fqy7u2s,t3_ggj8v2,1589744077.0,"The part where you describe your sleeping issues are dead-on how I struggled with sleep since childhood (just wanting to stay up until your sleep deprivation physically takes over). I remember when I was really little, I would lie awake in bed and cry because I really just didn’t want to sleep (even if I was sleepy).

I haven’t been able to explain this to anyone, or even understand it myself, but it’s refreshing to see someone else relate. 

I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and GAD as well, btw. I’ve been thinking my sleep issue is probably part of ADHD - struggling with having to convince myself to do something boring (sleep), even if I know I really need to just do it. 

But your post makes me wonder if there’s more to it. Like if the sleep thing is a feature of maybe the combination of ADHD and GAD, or something else that’s been undiagnosed. 

Also, it’s interesting that you wonder about BPD, because I’ve also wondered if I have that. I’ve had someone suggest bipolar to me as well, and I also didn’t agree (btw, bipolar and ADHD have a lot of seemingly overlapping presentations)."

With that said, I’m pretty sure it doesn’t matter whether the symptoms are due to an event in your life (death of a close friend, getting fired, or even getting a bad grade), or seemingly “out of the blue.” If the manifestations meet the criteria of clinical depression — it’s depression. 

The whole point being — if someone is suicidal over a C on their exam, they may very well be just as at risk of death as someone suicidal over becoming homeless; both need and deserve medical treatment.
