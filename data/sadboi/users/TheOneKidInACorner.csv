Assuming that the concept of time isn't linear, every time you go back a new timeline would be created, with everything up to that point being the same and the decisions you make after that point of reset would vary. 

Another way to think about it is that time is linear, so if you spilled a drink at 4:50, tripped over nothing at 5:21 and reset at 5:30 exactly, everything would still happen. You'd still spill a drink, trip over nothing and time would still reset at 5:30 exactly. Effectively putting everyone in an endless time loop. If you died, then you'd keep dying forever.
