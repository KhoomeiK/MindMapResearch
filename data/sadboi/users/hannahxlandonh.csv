Dynavap,fr57dzb,t3_gmo9vh,1589903797.0,"There's most certainly a difference. Especially in an induction heater. The induction heater heats the ss slower and clicks slower. It's also a lower temp hit and lasts longer draw. The Ti tip heats up quicker hitting a higher temp and cools down far quicker.
I don't think either is better or worse. Just a different experience."
