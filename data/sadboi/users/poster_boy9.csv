depression,fpykk5p,t3_enrs4c,1589005451.0,"I totally feel like this and still do with almost everyone I know.  But if you can find one person that you can confide in and share all of your feelings with it really helps. 

I realized the more I talk about how I'm feeling in certain situations with my brother the more he understands me and the more 'believable' I am in his eyes. If you feel like the person is at the point where they can realize how bad depression really is, it can make you a lot more comfortable when speaking up about it to that person."
depression,flc3mz7,t3_fnxehr,1585019060.0,That’s great man! This really gives hope to people who are having those types of thoughts
infp,fladh1e,t3_fng73t,1584981696.0,Why can’t this be a guy in the middle?
infp,fkta0ny,t3_fjf9r1,1584511152.0,"To me, its simple but deep"
infp,fkpidyd,t3_fjnq7y,1584410873.0,"Notice almost all of these are feminine. But as a male INFP I relate to so many.

It’s tough out here"
depression,fke8urp,t1_fkdutvx,1584107969.0,"Yeah I think not having confidence in my internal values + anxiety factor into my indecisiveness 

Regarding the devils advocate thing I totally relate. At work I always say something that’s viewed by coworkers as kind of negative and most of the time I don’t realize it.

In the US, people are always looking for the positives to say which makes sense. I’m actually not sure about other countries.

But sometimes I think of these people who are overly positive and have this bright attitude as almost delusional ahaha. I know it’s a product of my depression because my lens on life is definitely gray filtered."
infp,fjf0d2i,t1_fjdmpbr,1583281611.0,Haha still trying to get the right elevation

infp,fehmnu2,t3_eo97vu,1579119642.0,Oops
infp,fecc6ac,t3_eo97vu,1578970531.0,"HAHA I’m 24 and it’s spot on 

Add to the fact that INFPs are drawn to children and this is basically perfect"
infp,fdr7bjx,t1_fdr6mom,1578680515.0,"Doing that literally right now haha 
I definitely have a lot of mood music playlists"
infp,fdr63f8,t1_fdpefs1,1578680001.0,"When I’m really down, I can’t help but listen to sad songs. I find it hard to enjoy upbeat “happy” music.

But when I feel good and listen to those upbeat songs while relating to the song, I feel really inspired and uplifted."
depression,ewk3ihv,t1_ewk0nne,1565476015.0,Thanks for the support. I totally agree- even when I'm at my lowest I'm aware of that fact
infp,etvuaga,t3_cdje9b,1563244901.0,HAHA this was actually hilarious
depression,etkjfzn,t1_etj0oud,1562899607.0,This is great and something that I realized only recently. I am trying to view the past as something that is somewhat irrelevant in order for me to move forward in life.
AskReddit,es5e5yy,t3_bjiaaq,1561608918.0,"1. Being envious of people who are happy
2. Believing people who are happy are faking their energy and emotions because you don't know how they have that ability.
3. Not wanting to express your feelings/opinions because you don't believe anyone cares and it takes too much energy to talk
4. Not knowing who you are sometimes

I know you've said one but I've been depressed for 3+ years. This is just a way for me to vent. Thank you OP."
StackAdvice,ernb9kn,t3_c2tipx,1561048820.0,"I’ve experienced the same withdrawal symptoms for small amounts (anywhere from 30mg+) for the past three or so years. 

For the past week, I started taking a supplement that boosted my serotonin (CBD blend) due to my depression. What I noticed is that caffeine affected me less after this supplement. I currently don’t have nearly as bad withdrawal symptoms with caffeine. For example, If I have a cup of tea in the morning and skip it the next day, I won’t be affected much."
