Using mysterious stranger swashbuckler 1/hexcrafter magus x, using rimespell, frostbite and  the enforcer feat, and you can totally debilitate enemies. Leaves them staggered, shaken, and entangled, all with one hit. From there, one can move into tripping, or other CC type shenanigans to totally fuck with enemy threats."

Pathfinder_RPG,eyto0ys,t3_cxbx1d,1567441452.0,"Hey all. Working on a kobold sniper for 1e. Debating between master sniper, and the vital strike line of feats for a gunslinger/slayer build using a musket.

With greater vital strike, i can roll my damage die multiple times, but only get sneak attack once ( provided i can get it at all). With master sniper, i have to roll 2 attacks, but have the posibility of sneak attack twice. I,m trying to find the best way to maximize damage here. Currently, hes built musketmaster 8/sniper 12 for the extra d6's, but it can be changed easily.

This is just a theorycraft build."

relationships,equ177v,t1_eqttr7v,1560323024.0,"I called and conferred with GF befor posting. 

I think my biggest issue, is what youve stated here. Im stepping into a serious role as a parental/ father figure not right away, but soon) amd feel like i dont have any control. But the tricky bit, is im coming in late to the game. How do i assert myself when im the late comer, as it were? S has been around for a long time, and i'm new.

We have promise from M to babysit in the future in some hypothetical sense, but no concrete dates. This doesnt bug me so much, because everyones schedules are in the air.

I dont think S is up to babysitting, frankly. She'd balk at the idea for more than a little at a time. GF needs to go to the DMV this weekend, and asked S To go with before asking me, because she knew id hang with kids, but S would not (admittedly i got bitchy at this, cause its the DMV, but itd be time to just chill out as ""us time"" and i was upset i was a second string invite. GF explained this was so the dmv would be easier, as i could manage kids while she just did her shit and got out: reasonable, but i'd like the opertunity to make my case all the same) 

S begged off to spend time on a side gig anyway. S seems to not be a helper unless it suits her, which grinds my gears. But mostly, the problem i hold with S Is that the time shes over is about her desires and needs, rather than GF or kids."
