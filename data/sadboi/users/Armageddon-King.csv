death,fqizz4f,t1_fqiyjpq,1589403176.0,"Knowing could cause it sooner too. If my death is of old age in 60 years then I’ll live my life believing it. Taking risks which I might of not taken before. Even if I still proceeded carefully, I’d end up on a different route then before. I only know the outcome and not the process that leads to my death. so I’d rather live my life Knowing I will die, but not knowing when or how. Not knowing the future is what makes life beautiful. Knowing of your own death would be torment, because it would constantly change with every action you take. Making life all about avoiding death. Which in the end makes you miss out on life."

We hung out like best buds for the majority of the school day. In the last class we had together, the teacher decided we should pass a ball around so we could get to know each other. Before hand, everyone shared their name. Then we’d pass the ball to someone and say their name. Well, for some Tom fuckery fate I was expected to pass the ball to him. I froze up, his face fell. And we never talked for the rest of the year. I had a chance to catch his name, but I was a dumbass and didn’t. Did I learn my mistake? No, I didn’t cause a similar thing happened not even a year later."
