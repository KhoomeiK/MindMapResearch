dating_advice,fr2nlg5,t3_gmazsw,1589840462.0,"5'6 isnt a killer for every woman. I've dated men that height, I had a serious relationship for 6 years with a man that height, he was the same height as I was. I never thought of him as less manly or anything. And I never noticed it unless someone pointed it out. 

And for the record, we broke up because he was unfaithful with a mutual friends sister, and they were together for a few years after I caught him and bailed.
So quit focusing on that, just be a good person that's nice to be around. I loved my ex alot because of the person he was, not his height. Even though he cheated which sucked, it didn't take away all the good times we had together. So just focus on doing things you like and meeting people who like those things too! Dont give up!  Oh and happy birthday!"

All I get is ""don't watch the news or depressing things and take less of your anxiety drug so it's more effective. 

It's like as long as I'm not fully manic, she doesn't care and its SO FUCKING FRUSTRATING.  I'm tired of being tired and angry and depressed.

And I'm guessing they will be less aggressive about it face to face than when they are passive-aggressively calling the cops.

And if you dont reach a solution, now your landlord is informed, and if further problems occur this may help you alot. Another thing you may want to check is where your stereo is located.

Then she basically moved into the central position in the group, because she was so great for telling everyone what a bitch I really was. She did all of this for attention, because she just didn't  like me and wanted to hang with everyone without me. She told me this when I confronted her. She said I was boring and ruined the group and nobody told me but they really didn't like me. Lesson is, some people are shit and will completely fuck over someone for no reason other than they want something and you're in the way.

Anyway, it started with a few water balloons on the windshield, which wasn't a huge deal, we just chalked it up as kids being bored. 

Then about a week later , it turned into eggs all over our windshield.  Now I quite frequently see the kid that lives on there on the balcony above us. Magically, he's always there watching when we clean up his bullshit.

Well today he upgraded  to rocks and completely smashed our windshield.  You can tell the rocks came from above by the angle on the windshield, I have no doubt it's him. We did call the police, but they did nothing but inform us we couldn't prove it. So now we're stuck with a $500 bill because we don't  have glass coverage and that little fuck just gets away with it.

This INFURIATES me to no end, we're really tight on money now since he got his hours cut drastically and I'm recovering from surgery. It's just the worst time ever and I'm so so so angry and frustrated that we just get fucked over because some little asshole was bored and alone. 

Anyway reddit, what should I do here? My bf has banned me from talking to his mother because I'm so angry, but I feel she should get a bit of my anger. So anyone have any ideas? For revenge, to get our money back, to just make me feel better instead of just one more time where I take it and cry? That bill basically means I will have to eek out my meds for an extra month and risk mania and I'm feeling very petty and resentful.

I'm a girl and I would NEVER do this, my bf's friends are his deal, she had no place even getting involved IMHO. 

Honestly, stay quiet and be glad you aren't getting dragged into his shit anymore. He'll probably be back when goes broke and his GF bails or cheats, because that's what women who are just in it for the $ do. Just keep on keeping on OP."

Yes car accidents kill people, but there are lots of steps you can take to reduce your risk on the road, just like staying home reduces the risk of catching an extremely  communicable virus. You wear a seat belt and stay near the speed limits, that's the same kind of risk management as staying home now. Idiots. And how the fuck do you quarantine child sex traffickers? It's  not like they're on the grid or even here legally or pay taxes sooo...."

Anxiety,fnhtz8g,t3_g1unzl,1586968808.0,"Self hugs are one thing I learned in trauma therapy. You can do that alone or with breathing exercises, but I find it helpful. Whenever I'm feeling anxiety set in, just cross your arms in front of you and put your hands on your upper arms or shoulders and squeeze. Then open your hands and pat your own shoulders alternating sides until you feel better. I had some pretty bad trauma a few years ago and this exercise does help me. I'm in EMDR therapy and this really helped when I learned it. It's also called butterfly hugs. Check out this video, I may have done a terrible job of explaining it.

Advice,fnhqezm,t3_g1u0sl,1586967044.0,"Try r/relationship_advice might get better feedback. Also this girl seems to be using you, I'm a woman and I've never asked for anything like that from any of my relationships. More than  half your take home pay is RIDICULOUS. Everyone likes presents, but you can't  demand them, that's just being selfish and it says alot about her character. You can find a much better lady that's actually interested in you, not your wallet."
legaladvice,fnhm3pv,t3_g1u10v,1586964897.0,"NAL but did you stop to think about how this may effect your wife? If she already has mental health issues (and I'm speaking from experience) repeated abortions may weigh on her mental health even more and just cause more problems. I was totally fine with having an abortion, but I also cried alot afterward and I was surprised at the level of my grief. Legally, as abortion is legal in California, then technically I dont think you're committing fraud. 

I also really hope you're not trolling, because this seems like a very badly thought out plan. You can't really time pregnancies like that, and what happens if she misses the cues until it's too late and then you have a baby and a wife with mental health issues. And again since she has issues already, she will probably get post partum depression on top of what she already has and that will cause her even more issues. The more I think about it, this is just a horrible idea all around, at least for your wife, it just seems to be full of consequences for her that seen worse than what she's already enduring. Legally you're probably safe, but ot just seems very really bad."
NoStupidQuestions,fnaos37,t3_g0npd9,1586801178.0,"The one I went to wasn't that bad....but it wasn't that great either and I definitely NEVER want to go back. I've also been to a few residential treatments and the issues are always the same. 
1. Staff has power trip issues: since you are ""mentally ill"" most staff will assume you are not honest and will question EVERYTHING you say. They will listen to conversations you have with other staff or patients and relay that to your doctor so you have to stay longer and they always make whatever you say sound awful, no matter if you were emotional at the time when something is said. And you can try to argue all you want, you're mentally ill so only the staff member's word is reliable. Its incredibly frustrating.
 
2. You're not stable or calm and they put you in a group of other people with various disorders and substance abuse problems, then don't  expect problems between the residents and punish those who have issues with each other. I feel this is the dumbest thing about mental hospitals, you can't put someone coming down from a binge with someone who is manic with someone who's schizo affective and expect no problems. Its ridiculous. And it caused me a ton of anxiety and stress, it doesn't help at all. 

3. You only get about 15 min a day with an actual Psychiatrist or Psychologist, the rest of your day is taken up with pointless groups you have to share in or they report you for not participating and you have to stay longer. I HATED this. I'm uncomfortable in groups of people and talking in front of people I don't know due to past trauma and this was my whole day. It didn't help in the least, I was constantly on the edge of a panic attack the whole time I was there. Also the psych  doctor I had accused me of lying about my rape until I took testing that showed my past trauma.

I only spent 8 days there, but it was the least helpful thing to my mental illness I've ever experienced.  My therapist called there daily and fought with them until they finally released me. I ended up there because I was having a manic episode (I'm bipolar 1) and had went to the ER because i hadn't slept in two days and I was hearing voices telling me to hang myself. The only thing I learned was to never go to the ER when manic, because they'll just stick you there. 

Anyway sorry for the long post, if you have questions ask away. But that was my mental hospital experience"
