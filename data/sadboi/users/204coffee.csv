Anxiety,fp0v8ro,t1_foxs0uw,1588217689.0,"It's not that she'd rather it, she has no control over her depression. She's as much a victim here as you are if not more. You cant put the blame on her and you have to remember we are goal setting creatures and a dream is a goal. It's the eye at the top of the pyramid. The ideal exists within an archetype and it sounds like you're overreacting. She may feel it is out of reach because of situational factors contributing to her mental state such as feeling she has no control over the distance in your relationship. 

Bridge the gap. Test the waters. Do whatever you got to do but dont dare make it about you until you've exhausted all your options and you're dead certain you'd rather leave than deal with it because if you cant deal with waves of this for the rest of your life, not saying that she will be in and out of it forever but you might as well prepare for the worst, but if you're not prepared for that then you might make it significantly harder on her in the long run by trying to make this about you. You have some decisions to make. The anxiety is an indication theres action that needs to be taken.

Edit: are you going to let *this*  be what takes *you*  down? She's the one battling it, the least you can do is be there for her. If you're not emotionally and psychologically prepared to encounter chaos and to willing take on the responsibility that's required as a result of that battle, then you've got another thing coming."
Anxiety,foxjunu,t3_ga430s,1588146269.0,"Sounds like she's quite depressed and might be having thoughts of suicide, but I also wouldnt approach the situation with any assumptions. It can be difficult to hold conversations or to see the point in cleaning yourself while depressed so given everything going on in the world I'd say they have a right to their pain and their suffering and we dont have a right to take home other people's pain because it's not helpful for them and it's especially not helpful for you. People grieve in their own ways and we cant try to push them through the pain but we can be there for them when they need us and we have to trust that they'll ask us for help if they need it and if theres nothing more you can do dont try to overstep boundaries. 

Ask them if they think you're overstepping or explain how you're unsatisfied with the relationship if that's what it is, either way face chaos willingly and be prepared to have to be patient."
writing,foszv43,t3_g9eq3x,1588041557.0,"Because as a nation we suck at teaching people how to write and instead we teach them to memorize and regurgitate so there is nothing of substance tying their ideas together, theres no narrative, it's a bland outline of what they think is expected of them. The issue with bad writing, is it's usually not just a little thing here and there that you can point out is wrong, because at what level is it wrong? Is it the words? The sentence? The sentences? The paragraph? The whole essay? Well with really bad writing theres usually a problem at every level of analysis and trying to find something useful to use to help teach that person where they went wrong and what they can do better is really difficult if the person hasn't invested much time into writing outside of what they've been forced to write for school. They fail to make their ideas come to life and instead they rewrite what they read

Anxiety,fo9lfda,t3_g6heg5,1587622982.0,"The studies on this have been clear. If you take someone with an extreme phobia or some form of anxiety towards a given situation, object, person, etc, if the person is encouraged to approach and encounter the thing they're most afraid of in very small doses, at any time the participant can leave the room if it's too much for them. 

So if you're afraid of elevators because it might break and you might die so you dont step in elevators, maybe we'll walk towards where the elevator is and we will negotiate and see what you think you could realistically ask from yourself in facing the elevator. Even if it's so bad that we can only manage to look at the elevator for 10 seconds before we have to get far from it, next time we might see if you can handle 20 seconds, and if at that point you're not completely overwhelmed we might stand there a while longer. 

Each little victory is motivating and it shows the person what they're really capable of and it is not that the person becomes less afraid of the phobia, but that they get more courageous in the face of chaos as a whole.

Eventually we might enter the elevator without letting it change floors and once we're comfortable with that we might try riding the elevator a floor up or down.

This isnt to say that we accomplished this in a day, it may take days, weeks, months, or years to position ourselves in the world so that we may be in a position with enough stability, security and a strong enough support system to help us get back on the saddle every time we fall off.
