schizophrenia,fql8hz4,t3_gjegao,1589449987.0,Yeah my schizophrenia was triggered by drug use. I did disassociates occasionally but the stuff that you could really feel acting to produce psychosis was dopaminergic drugs like LSD and psilocybin.
schizophrenia,fqh04ld,t1_fqfvu7p,1589363216.0,I used to think this. It took me awhile of being stable to be able to calm myself and return to having faith in God and believing I am saved. I have memories of burning in hell though I now think it was a sort of purgatory and we get reincarnated. I am catholic so I think most go to purgatory.  Not exactly clear about after that. You either transcend or have to get reincarnated to learn what you need to learn from being human. My views currently are not that orthodox and in line with the church but I feel like maybe I know too much. Anyway in the end you have to actively reject ultimate love and grace to go to hell which is nearly impossible for most people. You have to really be hating God and wanting to do evil. Pretty much satanic at that point and knowingly joined with evil. thats when hell will get you.
schizophrenia,fqgze7p,t1_fqgydyv,1589362475.0,cant sleep either
schizophrenia,fpwvi82,t1_fpwbvx9,1588970734.0,I’m glad I have no idea who any of those people are except for kanye. I heard of the XXX guy when he died. Just sounded like he was on shit ton of drugs. Most music nowadays seems to be about stuff like that. people are eating it up. Lol if you got some time on your hands read Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. History repeats itself.

schizophrenia,fpjcs7g,t1_fpjcki3,1588663848.0,Yeah it did the same for me but gave me a funny feeling around the eyes. I would definitely recommend valerian root for anxiety and sleeping at night. It seems more focused on relaxation while the ashwaganda is having other effects on top
schizophrenia,fpjcn7a,t1_fpjc8id,1588663708.0,no meds leads to paranoia whichs leads to psychosis and/or suicide attempt which leads to hospitalization

schizophrenia,fpjchhx,t1_fpjcdjp,1588663549.0,no i wasnt. my schizophrenia was triggered by LSD and it has just been a bad nightmare trip since then
schizophrenia,fpjcev4,t3_g84v6z,1588663478.0,ive found valerian root to be beneficial at calming anxiety and sleeping. Ashwaganda made me feel funny. Niacin seems to help overall peformance and is supported by medical evidence. I did Lions Mane for 4 months. Didnt notice much. Sacrosine had a pretty good effect on negative symptoms. Not sure about Holy Basil. I’ve done many supplements and also hard chemicals in attempts to remedy myself and can give you my experiences.
schizophrenia,fpjc0s7,t1_fpjbsdb,1588663096.0,thats amazing. mine was always associated with evil and felt like demonic possession. sometimes it was a positive ego death feeling but usually a scary negative one so I would mentally do all I could to prevent it

It also makes me loose hope that I will live with anybody if thats what most people deal with in regards to schizophrenia. I live on my own with my cat and am really quiet... I’m not sure how to handle it. He obviously needs help. The poor guy is probably scared shitless. Think scared frightened animal thinking its about to be killed. When I have been like that thats how it feels. It’s awful...

schizophrenia,fpj8apo,t3_gds29g,1588659623.0,Yeah the typical social media stuff is not beneficial to us. I’m sick of seeing memes on every post here. This is a serious place for a serious illness.

Her pestilence bears forth the sweet, fragrant flowers of death

They bloom on the gentle sleeping bodies of the tender beauties

She longs to release us

That which we try with all of our heart and soul to fight.

It is love

She tends her garden..."

This world uncertain is;
Fond are life's lustful joys;
Death proves them all but toys;
None from his darts can fly;
I am sick, I must die.
    Lord, have mercy on us!

Rich men, trust not in wealth,
Gold cannot buy you health;
Physic himself must fade.
All things to end are made,
The plague full swift goes by;
I am sick, I must die.

Beauty is but a flower
Which wrinkles will devour;
Brightness falls from the air;
Queens have died young and fair;
Dust hath closed Helen's eye.
I am sick, I must die.
    Lord, have mercy on us!

Strength stoops unto the grave,
Worms feed on Hector brave;
Swords may not fight with fate,
Earth still holds open her gate.
""Come, come!"" the bells do cry.
I am sick, I must die.
    Lord, have mercy on us!

Wit with his wantonness
Tasteth death's bitterness;
Hell's executioner
Hath no ears for to hear
What vain art can reply.
I am sick, I must die.
    Lord, have mercy on us!

Haste, therefore, each degree,
To welcome destiny;
Heaven is our heritage,
Earth but a player's stage;
Mount we unto the sky.
I am sick, I must die.
