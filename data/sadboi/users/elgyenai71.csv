BipolarReddit,fd4r34u,t3_ej4fvz,1578170248.0,All of these stories are incredibly relatable and beautiful so inspiring. Going through an extremely difficult and hard time. Having bipolar disorder took so much away from me. Even though I don’t really know how I’m hopeful something will change for me.
SuicideWatch,fd04zd8,t3_ejrg97,1578113708.0,This is so weird but I feel the exact same way. I also attempted panic and called for help at the last minute and my life got incredibly worst after that. My friends has distanced themselves from me. I failed out of my classes. I strained my relationship with my parents. I am lifeless now so I completely get you we have a similar story. It’s absolutely crazy how you really don’t know what you have until it’s gone. I almost plead the universe for my old life back college friends normal relationship with my parent but you can’t get what you had back.
Life,fcftb63,t3_eh5ahx,1577633525.0,I have absolutely no word of wisdom but I read your post and I empathize with your struggle. All I can say is losing friends is a normal part of life. Your feelings are valid and life gets boring sometimes.
rape,fbxgwcw,t3_ef00le,1577186849.0,It’s definitely rape. You don’t actually have to say the word no if you ask to leave or previously stated that your uncomfortable then it should have never happen. When I was rape I did the same thing trying to convince myself it was consensual so I could feel better but I knew it was a lie and you do to. Try to get some help possibly report it I know I didn’t report mine and it made me feel like it wasn’t a crime and what he did wasn’t wrong. I’m so sorry this happen to you. If you ever need to talk I’m here
almosthomeless,fbxgdsb,t3_eexdel,1577186074.0,Yea call cps

depression,fbtk40a,t3_eefcvf,1577081909.0,I understand how you feel. This may sound stupid but please find some sort of happiness if you can (I’m hypocrite for asking you to find happiness in grades and in school when I couldn’t) find some happiness in that you are going to school and doing well. It’s hard for me to explain this but I had my depression take away my pride in school and my happiness about my grades and I wish I didn’t give that away to the beast. Try and really get some help when you start feeling good again. Maybe your school has mental health services and you could figure out your triggers or something. One of my biggest regret is not trying to manage my depression when I had good days and bad days and when I was doing well in school. I felt like if I did I would have a better chance at life and maybe you will too. I feel you and I understand you
depression,fbtjudv,t3_eeffci,1577081598.0,Well I completely understand how you feel. It’s very difficult to see yourself not do well and I’m so sorry you’re alone and not to sound ungrateful but family and friends can be a sinking hole sometimes. I’m sorry about the chronic pain and the over stimulation and not being able to get things done. I’m very suicidal at the moment so I can offer no help but I a stranger who knows nothing about you is here for you I wish I could say something or do something but I can’t I can just offer my words. I understand the pain you are in and I validate that pain and I know that offers me the tiniest bit of relief knowing that I’m not the only one suffering from the beast of depression
almosthomeless,fbtjggf,t3_eefplf,1577081151.0,I’m super close to suicide trying to sadly hype myself up I don’t know what I need don’t know how to fix it don’t know how to not be a fucked up individual I feel like suicide though a drastic step would atleast be me doing something other than being self destructive and then crying over the consequences one of them being my best homeless state

It just hard to wake up everyday feeling empty sad worthless that everyone is passing you by to see yourself disintegrated fail school unable to open up see all your friends abandoned you because your dead weight right now death seem so sweet I just need the courage

depression,fbt5x5z,t3_eee98f,1577069159.0,My aunt wanted me to engage in healthy habits but I feel so empty all the time I would stay out late and drink and smoke and that behavior was unacceptable. I cut my parents off but they weren’t dealing with my behavior either. I’m a fuck up use to be a decent person but mental illness happen. Thanks for talking to me
