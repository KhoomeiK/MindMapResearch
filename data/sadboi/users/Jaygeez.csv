I've heard varying stories on what is allowed and not, but I can't confirm what's accurate or not. I did my class 4 test in an old Ambulance as it was for my Paramedic course."
halifax,fejyrr6,t1_fejpavv,1579188907.0,"Class 4 takes:

* 1 year of holding a Class 5 licence
* Written Test
* Eye Exam
* Medical
* Drivers Road Test in a Class 4 vehicle.

Renewal requires a medical and eye exam every renewal period.

I could see it taking 2 years if you were dragging your feet, but honestly it can be done in 2-3 weeks depending on how far ahead they're booking road tests.

I think if Uber/Lyft is going to be operating as a commercial service, then they should be following the regulations of this province. I don't see how requiring some experience and getting an eye exam + medical is a bad thing. Nor a one time test + road test."

But you're also correct in the fact that the commercial providers there are probably a big chunk of $$$."
