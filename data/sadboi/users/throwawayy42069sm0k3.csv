Drugs,esajrdn,t3_c6kabt,1561761243.0,"Just this night I had a dream about smoking some joints with a homie. We were doing it outside at a river I think and I told him not to worry about police finding us there. Was a nice experience I think but then the cops came and we got in trouble, I felt very sorry, because I told him nothing would happen then I woke up still feeling kinda guilty about it lol"
Drugs,esajf20,t3_c6o0s8,1561761020.0,"My First real MDMA trip (actually the 3rd but I really didn't feel a lot the first two times because I was scared I guess and didn't Take enough) was New year. Was in a club with some mates till 7:30 ish and was home around 8 o' clock.

My long time best friend stayed at my place and we were still a bit high so we decided to watch some BBC (I think blue Planet) nature series and it was really funny. Kinda was half asleep until like 10 am when I got up to clean up the mess after the party I had at my place. Didn't feel really bad tbh and it was like that the whole day so maybe I was lucky idk..."

Yeah Harlem wasn't that much to see ur right, however really enjoyed seeing some more 'normal' parts of the city. 

I think we have already done all the very 'touristy stuff' so now looking for some more low key things :)"

Drugs,ertb7xn,t3_c3nohs,1561237519.0,When I moved out weed and diazepam were my daily ritual before sleeping and maybe before some parties to reduce my anxiety. Its a nice combo but imo can be really addictive and IT didnt really help me in the long run with my personal problems.
