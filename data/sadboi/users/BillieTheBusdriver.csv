The outcry after two-three weeks when there are a lot more out of work, and essentially locked up at home will be huge, in Italy the cases haven’t really dropped doing this.  People will be demanding out, it went to far etc.   NZ doesn’t even have food delivery available.  Think about the hair salon situation.  Changed to 1/2 hour, yes you can cut in that time, basic but doable.   Mostly female presenters at one of the media outlets (where my partner works) went off their heads internally.  Public went stupid saying it can’t be done in that time, the restriction was lifted.  

Being able to go for a walk helps.  Especially those in apartment blocks plus newer suburbs where people’s homes are 300-450m2, they have no room to move.   They need to be able to take themselves and any children for a walk.  Otherwise people end up with cabin fever, a rise in family violence, more yelling, etc, on top of the already stressed financial situation.  If letting people out for a walk stops or lowers mental health issues then good.

Many times we’ve been told 80% of people won’t need medical care, just need to be at home.   And the majority, not all, that need the care are older, chronic health conditions and it’s strongly suggested to them they stay home, I’m pretty sure they’ve done modeling based on two people together, who goes to hospital and who doesn’t, case and age spread, mental health issues from being confined, injuries from diy accidents now people are doing more, etc.

loseit,etw6rij,t3_cdj87y,1563256096.0,"Your BMI at 60kg and 177cm is 19.2 , so you're in the healthy range if you were 18+  (Healthy BMI is about 19-25 depending on the country you're in).   Being 6kg more you still would have been in the healthy weight range.

You're also 14 so you have some developing to do, I suggest that you speak to your Dr who can give you the correct weight range and depending on where you located refer you to a dietician or nutritionist who can help you with healthy eating.

Edit:  25% body fat for adult females is in the healthy range,  assuming you're female."
loseit,etw68nh,t3_cdkf6r,1563255520.0,"You need plus size models just as you need straight and child models.      The plus-size model is advertising a range of clothes that are made to that size range.       From looking at what's out there the majority of designers/brands make different clothes for different size ranges, so a size 6 wouldn't be able to model a size 16 and vice versa.    Now if by chance the designer made an all sizes range of 6 - 24 for example, the dress would look different on a size 6 to a 16 so different sizes are needed.  


Part two - if anyone has *really* read a lot of the posts on r/loseit you'll see a lot of losing weight is feeling good about yourself so you're able to.   I'm talking about the people that are obese/morbidly obese.   If a size 18 feels good about themselves and knows that they aren't being fat-shamed as much, it may just help them a little to lose a bit more."
BipolarReddit,etw4nzv,t3_cdowmk,1563253847.0,"It does get better, I've been there, to the highest highs and the lowest lows.   Then one day it will get a little bit better, then a little bit more the next.  And one day you'll look back and see how far you've come.   

I've read back through my journals from my depression cycles and the difference between now and then is huge.   But you don't notice it happening, but it does happen.  It will get better."
bipolar,etw4f41,t3_cdrdc7,1563253589.0,That looks really good - congrats on being able to achieve this.  I understand how big it was for you to do.
bipolar,ettrnr2,t3_cdd4a3,1563193765.0,The chakras will still be unlocked when you’re stable.  Get to that point then continue to work on your spirituality.
loseit,ettqq6f,t3_cdgmok,1563192817.0,"From a lot of life experience and seeing others in similar situations, unless your MIL really wants to lose weight for herself, no amount of motivational anything will work for her. It may seem worth trying to you, but if you push too hard she may go to the other extreme and try to avoid you.   

Encouraging healthy unprocessed food at best may be the way to go.  But even then tread carefully."
relationship_advice,etqw5b5,t3_ccw0n1,1563104631.0,"I’m adopted, it was a forced adoption as many of them were in the early 70s. I met my birth mother and we keep in contact on Facebook.    I’ve done everything to meet my birth father or even have just a photo and have failed.  I would do anything to meet him.  I’m sure you son feels like this as he probably has questions.  

I’m guessing your husband feels hurt about potentially bringing someone else into the family dynamic and possibly how your other children will feel.  Or perhaps he is worried about you and bring up memories.   I’d suggest seeing a counselor that specializes in this as there are a lot of people involved, not only you and you the boy that was adopted, but your husband, other children and his adoptive family."
bipolar,etqsys0,t3_ccvwum,1563100916.0,"I'm close to 50 and I'm finding as I get older episodes both depressive and mania is less intense and far shorter durations.    My down days are just that, a few days, no more weeks and months of it.   My manias rarely take off and really might be just normal up mood, not even counted as a hypomania.    My meds are down too.   I haven't needed substantial time off work for quite a few years.  


I think that situational issues are easier for me to deal with and I've learnt to dismiss stuff that would have previously made bipolar depression worse and not deal with them.     I know that I need so much sleep, time out from doing things, and to eat well.   I rarely have alcohol which can make my depression cycles worse.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping that in the next few years if I continue this way the meds will disappear completely or managed by diet/sleep etc."
