BPD,f76lkcn,t1_f6rvwvb,1573429606.0,"Well yes I am supportive but after 18 years together I'm not sure I can emotionally do it anymore. After many years of "" I love you and need you then the push away"" that always had happened, im not sure I can do this anymore. I have been looking for someone that wont treat me this way. I ve met someone that I think I could have a real future with but I'm very worried about my wifes mental stability. She is aware of the situation and has finally agreed to counseling by a psychologist to get better but I'm,not sure that will ever happen. I'm just not sure if I can do it anymore."

AskReddit,f3viibn,t3_di8aob,1571176819.0,"Ive been married for 18 years and have a 17 year old son. My wife and I have had our ups and downs over the years. Early on she cheated and I stayed for not only for our son but alot for her as well. As strange as that sounds but..she has Borderline personality disorder and I felt that I could somehow ""cure"" her or help her. After many years of good and bad I have realized I was very wrong. You can't help someone who does not want it. So...forward to this year and our relationship is not on the good side. I feel very alone and began to look outward. After 18 years of marriage( I was faithful for 17.9 of those) I found someone who I think that we may have a real connection. We have talked/ texted every day and have gone out for drinks/ lunch 6-7 times, and we have slept together twice. I'm sooo... Confused because I really have not had feelings like this for along time. I think she feels the same. Both situations are a bit more complicated than I can really get into but any advice is appreciated. I want to leave, help.!?"
