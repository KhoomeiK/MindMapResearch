I have a huge family and I'm the only one who has mental health issues and everyone else is normal and happy. It's so freaking weird. I'll be at the dinner table and they're all talking about how great their day was while I'm just sitting there in the weight of eternal existential pain wondering why I even have to exist. Like. How are you so happy without even trying. I have to psyche myself up so hard just to be able to get out of bed, I full on convince myself that life is worth living before I put in the effort of making myself a sandwich, God help me."

But most of the time they just forget about me. I only really hear from them when I text them first. It's irritating, let me tell you. Considering someone to be your best friend and not really getting the same commitment back is a really sad thing, and it's happened to me a lot. People suck. It's okay to feel the way you're feeling because I've felt that way too. But don't kill yourself over it because you deserve better. Just because someone didn't give that to you it doesn't mean that you can't be happy. Give that commitment to yourself. Love yourself."
