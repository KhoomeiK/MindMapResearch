You get rejected hundreds of times in a row, over and over again... you must just not be an attractive person. Why wouldn't you take into account people's reaction of you haha. You can truthfully express yourself all you want, but if no one is having it, you're going to be pretty sad and lonely."

I still havent had a ton of success. Slept with/dated 3 women and one one night stand. I'd say hit the gym hard (like make that your new part time job), new shorter haircut, after you've lost weight and picked out new well fitting/stylish clothes then have a professional take some photo shoots of you. Have people pick the best ones, maybe photofeeler, and spam the fuck out of every online site. It sucks man... I struggle with my looks every single day, so I get it. It's especially hard for me because I used to be somewhat decent looking about 6-7 years ago. Also check out goodlookingloser website and the forum."

Besides that, I dont think it hurt... but it doesnt help fix what's wrong with me. I have been on dating websites the past five years with very little success in either dating or making friends. I try to put my best self out there and am positive but that doesn't help. Too unattractive for dating sites. Couldn't do group therapy, that's just way too much to put out there to people in my community."
amIuglyBrutallyHonest,fpb0yik,t3_gcawci,1588459810.0,Naw you're kinda cute. Losing weight will definitely help face.  Try some light weightlighting too. Maybe see how you look with contacts?
