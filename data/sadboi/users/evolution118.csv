SandersForPresident,fgosd4w,t3_ezjih1,1580984246.0,Bernie Sanders is a good man but the forces of darkness are so strong. Trump and the malicious wights that are behind him won't stop until they defeat him. They change the rules when they seem to be losing. It's all so depressing. My hope is only a glimmer and a spark now.

When the alarm went off it was like I'd just emerged from the depths of the Marianas trench, huge lungfuls of air and rapidly blinking like a lunatic while my heart was trying to beat itself out of my chest.

Harry is so great, he had already scored a banger, a worldie from outside the box but still gives Son his due. I love that they pull for each other. I fking love these guys.

Sonny deserves all the happiness. Harry deserves all the goals. Spurs deserves all the trophies. Really beautiful work. Legends."

The truth is we're lucky to have him because of his skill, his engine, his loyalty and his temperament. Loads of EPL teams would tear our arms off for a chance to have him. I truly hope that he stays with us for the rest of his career."

classicwow,f1u2hng,t1_f1rsegu,1569753556.0,This noob tank didn't even understand that healing creates threat. He kept telling the priest not to attack the mobs because he didn't tab targets so he lost aggro.
classicwow,f1ql6oi,t1_f1qimem,1569702785.0,"It happened in a Gnomer pug run today. The healer priest was annoyed that the druid tank wasn't picking up adds and wanting to be rezzed instead of corpse running like everyone else. TBH he was a pretty shitty tank. They got into it right before the last boss, feelings were hurt. Anyway, we start the fight and get the boss to 3 % and just about to down him when the tank kicks the priest so she couldn't loot or even complete her quest. It was a pretty shitty thing to do to say the least. We were all shocked. I told the tank that it was uncool and he was going on my ignore list. I doubt he cared too much. I told the priest I would tank Gnomer for her next time if she needed one."
classicwow,f1euyf7,t1_f1bdhaf,1569430825.0,I actually prefer the retail travel form. A majestic stag is more suited to the Northern Nelf forests while a cheetah is perfect for our horde druid brethren on the great savannah plains.

I miss my nelf druid so much. I started in late vanilla but my best memories are of TBC. When I finally left wow I parked all my alts in nice inns and comfy places. I can't wait to roll a new char in classic and visit all my slumbering retail alts. For the Alliance!"

The more I think about how DnD cut and run and willfully pissed all over the franchise because they were burnt out or whatever the hell their excuses are, the more I hope they never touch another show ever again. 

Such lazy arrogant egotism from these two cretins. I truly think that they started to believe their own hype and thought that they owned the story so they could do with it whatever they pleased. I think they thought, ""it's our show so we can tell it however we want. We can even destroy it if we like."" 

I swear that I will never give another penny of my money to anything that DnD are ever involved with. They were custodians who thought they were creators. The memory of all the great scenes that they contributed throughout the seasons were washed away with the filthy canal water of their tepid arrogance. The North remembers DnD. Cnts!

I can't believe I'm still so mad bro."
