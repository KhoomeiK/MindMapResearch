These kind of characters are what I want from this anime, just realistic depiction of someone who can actually talk like a normal person. Rikuo acts like an annoying tsundere.

It's just that every single doorknob I've seen has the keyhole below the knob, so you don't do shit with the knob except when you hold the door closed. Jesus. The things you learn on Reddit.

Tried looking and found a few people saying that it probably does take different exposures, but nothing concrete.

> It is believed to use underexposed and overexposed frames like [Smart HDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smart_HDR&action=edit&redlink=1) from [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) 

⌃⌃ that is on Wikipedia

Interesting, because in my case HDR+ and HDR+ enhanced have the same dynamic range, the main difference are the details. In the exif it does say that the exposures are different between HDR+ and HDR+ enhanced, but I don't know if it's because of HDR+ just using faster shutter speeds overall, or if it's because HDR+ enhanced takes different exposures and thus you won't see that properly in exif."
Android,fnd2xxg,t1_fncyrzb,1586856658.0,"That's not what I said. I was referring to HDR+.

Let's go all over, shall we?

HDR - underexposed + overexposed exposures

HDR+ - google's name of their algorhitm, takes a bunch of underexposed frames, but despite the name doesn't work like normal HDR.

In the first comment I quoted the article where they were talking about normal HDR and I said that I want that, because I can't get proper dynamic range with google ports with HDR+.

And nowhere did I write that normal HDR doesn't take different exposures. Look above and look where I wrote ""at the same shutter speed and ISO"".

Thank you for understanding, I appreciate it very much."
Android,fncwlli,t1_fnc0pj7,1586849732.0,">This is what regular HDR is.

What do you mean? Taking multiple exposures at the same shutter speed and ISO is not regular HDR.

HDR stands for high dynamic range, and the regular method is to take underexposed and overexposed photos and merge them. With 2 of those photos you'll probably get better dynamic range than 50 ""HDR+ photos"".

HDR+ is good for increasing detail and it also obviously increases dynamic range, but not by much. I took astrophotos of M42 and M31 and captured around 500 exposures for that to be merged."

Android,fnc0u8j,t1_fnc0pj7,1586826254.0,"I use exclusively HDR+ enhanced. It's the same thing anyway. Regular HDR+ buffers the frames beforehand, so it takes the photo instantly vs taking the exposures after pressing the shutter button.

Relying on a single exposure will always limit your dynamic range. You could take 100 HDR+ frames and it would help to reduce the noise, thus allowing you to bring up the shadows, but your phone won't be able to do that and it's also really inefficient compared to taking different exposures."
