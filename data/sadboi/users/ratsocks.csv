homeowners,ffsmcpo,t1_ffrw370,1580185345.0,Town planning master plans are a good way to start. These can usually be found online these days. Or you can go the planning department and request public information about neighboring properties.
homeowners,ffrm4tm,t3_euryhp,1580160885.0,This is unfortunate but happens often. My neighborhood is being built up quickly and small single family homes are being demolished and replaced with 4-story apartment buildings built to within 5 ft of the property line. It’s just a matter of time.
homeowners,ffrkhnm,t3_eusbal,1580159888.0,"If you get the line scoped you will know the condition and can take action to have it replaced or repaired or not. Better to take action ahead of time rather than relying on insurance to fix the situation when it goes awry. 

I would get it scoped and then make the decision. I’m not sure what the value in sewer insurance is unless it is in bad condition and you choose to not repair or replace it."

homeowners,ffpebuv,t1_ffp7ero,1580092919.0,"IANAL but if your HOA screwed up as badly as it sounds, I think you’d have a very good case to get the condo returned to its former condition or at the least be compensated for the loss in value. 

Like many other comments here, I think you’re talking to the wrong attorneys.

homeowners,ff16kb7,t1_fezw3be,1579475716.0,900/month to insure a vacant house? If that’s in dollars that’s crazy.
