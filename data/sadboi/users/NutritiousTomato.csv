The real issue is faulty thinking or cognitive biases. These are responsible for viewing short men in a negative light.

short,fl99pra,t1_fl34vnb,1584946160.0,"I think the real problem is the mentality.

There would be zero issues if, for instance, Disney movies and the rest of the media and environmental factors we‚Äôve been exposed to made it seem like short men weren‚Äôt bad, but neutral, just like tall men. Both have advantages and disadvantages. 

Or if we grew in a society where somehow short was always regarded as superior and tall as inferior, guess who would be complaining right now? Not us short guys.

There is no such thing as an inherit attraction to tall. When a 4‚Äô11‚Äù woman says she absolutely needs a man that‚Äôs 6‚Äô0‚Äù or more, you can see this clearly. That extreme of a height difference couldn‚Äôt possibly have been due to evolution. It‚Äôs just so rare. Then you also find women who are average or tall and prefer short because they happened to have the critical thinking skills to see beyond the socialization nonsense. Or because they grew up around a community that was accepting of short men. Maybe she had a short friend, father, brother, or other family. Maybe her mother was into short guys and always said good things aboutz them. Maybe she grew up watching Kevin Hart.

Most of it, if not all of it is just socialization. It‚Äôs psychology. Tall is good. Short is bad. Repeat that to girls in various forms since they‚Äôre an infant, and boom, the ones incapable of critical thinking will buy it very, very well.

In psychology it is known that the closer we are to average in any way, the more that tends to mean we‚Äôre attractive. So average is literally another word for attractive. However, over the long term, people with unique and controversial traits have the advantage. You can look this up for yourself, too.

Nobody is average. Everyone is unique and controversial in some ways. Those who use it to their advantage succeed."
short,fl98s8h,t1_fl7zhmk,1584945133.0,"As far as I‚Äôm concerned, love is created. 

Many of us may have a list of expectations, but nobody can ever meet them fully. Humans are each so complex and unique. Sure, they may meet many of the traits we want, but never all. It‚Äôs just not likely due to the sheer amount of variables that could be different.

If it‚Äôs not one thing it‚Äôs another. If it‚Äôs not height, it‚Äôs politics. If it‚Äôs not politics, it‚Äôs the way they chew. If it‚Äôs not the way they chew, maybe they have a medical condition that they have to deal with all their lives. If it‚Äôs not a medical condition, maybe it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre too impulsive, their nose is slightly larger than we imagined our ideal partner would have. Maybe they have acne scars. Maybe they have depression. Maybe they‚Äôll get cancer one day. Maybe they‚Äôll get hit by a car and die. Did you ever desire any of this in a partner? Maybe, maybe not. 

The point is, love is created. You choose to be with that person because they‚Äôre good enough for you. And you learn to love all parts of them, even the parts you never imagined you wanted. You view your partner as a package deal. There is nobody else like him or her. You LEARN to love ALL parts of her. You communicate and grow together.

In regards to height, if a woman did not initially prefer or desire a short man such as myself, she better learn to love it or it‚Äôs not going to work."

I‚Äôve gotten called ‚Äútiny‚Äù a few times and took it a bit bad. Because, as a man, you want to be strong to and for women, and tiny may imply the opposite of that. In hindsight, though, maybe they meant it in a very good way. Tiny but mighty.

I feel like a lot of women have this rule of wanting a man taller. So a guy who is 5‚Äô3‚Äù in height is quite different than one that is 5‚Äô5‚Äù or 5‚Äô7‚Äù. Those few inches place them as taller than a lot more women than someone who is 5‚Äô3‚Äù. I hate that rule.

short,fkwyfok,t3_fh7vwn,1584611429.0,"There are three main options as I see it:

1. Put your height on your profile.  

This saves you a lot of time and energy because you know everyone who took the time to read your profile or even glanced at it already know. It also shows confidence if you write it confidently. Don‚Äôt even comment about it, just put your height on it, even on Tinder, where there is no height option. Just put it in your bio. I put it in the very beginning so it reduces the chances of it being missed. For dating apps that have a height option, I feel it‚Äôs more of a red flag if someone doesn‚Äôt put their height on. Shows they‚Äôre trying to hide it, and why would you?

2. Don‚Äôt mention your height until after you‚Äôve shown them your personality. 

The idea here is, even if they wouldn‚Äôt have been open to dating a guy your height initially, your personality and charm has now changed their minds enough to be open to it. Remember, people are attracted to you based on how you make them feel, not because of how tall you are. 

But this comes with the risk of wasting time and energy if once they do find out and they‚Äôre still not interested. Still, it could be worth it if you can win them with your charm. All the sweeter the victory. And you will have opened up a woman to dating short guys, doing all of us a favor.

3. Don‚Äôt ever bring up your height at all until you meet and she finds out when she sees you for the first time.

This is obviously highly risky. But I‚Äôve done it a few times with no problems. At least none that I was aware of. I can‚Äôt read their minds, after all. But these were usually just hookups and not really serious dates so it didn‚Äôt matter to much anyway. Also if you‚Äôre quite good at reading people, you might be able to tell if they‚Äôre the type of person who would care. Sometimes I just didn‚Äôt feel it was important to tell her, based on how her personality was. I knew she wouldn‚Äôt really care. Or I, myself, didn‚Äôt care enough to tell her.

If it‚Äôs a serious date, however, and the woman is unkind or particularly shallow about height, you might get rejected, hurt, and/or waste each other‚Äôs time. But really, one can argue that if a woman cares THAT much about your height, she should have asked before meeting. And if she‚Äôs a decent woman, she won‚Äôt be rude about it so you may still have the whole date to win her over with your personality and charm; thus doing all us shorties a favor.

What bothered me about her was that she did the opposite. And that‚Äôs how I had my moment of realization that I could not date a woman who saw my height as a bad thing and that she‚Äôd prefer taller men.

Call me insecure, but to me, especially when it comes to height, it sounds like hell to be with someone who would think and say stuff like that to me.
