BipolarReddit,ffbev50,t1_fesikev,1579762271.0,has my entire career in sex-work just been a years-long manic episode this whole time?
bipolar,ffbe8i4,t3_esp20o,1579761545.0,"i dont even take my own advice on this, but running in the middle of the night used to help me knock myself out after days of not sleeping. not in the 'fix ur mental illness with exercise' way, just literally exhausting urself w some cardio. i smoke a lot so running gets me tired fast hahah. ill brush my teeth, run in my pjs, then come inside and get straight into bed. unfortunately its winter so these days i just masturbate :\\"
