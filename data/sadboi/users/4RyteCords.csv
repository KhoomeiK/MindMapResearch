beyondthebump,fqusc7d,t1_fqtmt9i,1589663835.0,"It's hard I guess because some kids respond well to different things. I was spanked as a kid but only for doing something seriously naughty. I never felt like I was hit out of frustration. My mum would always be very clear about the consequences of my actions. And say things like if you do this again or don't stop doing this you will be spanked. I think I might of got a good spanking maybe three times in my life. But the fear of it stopped me being naughty or disobedient.

I don't want to ever hit my child. I agree in the sense of how can I cause pain to someone I love so much. Yet I feel it will remain an option. But like I said, all kids are different and respond to different things. Time outs didn't work for me. I would fight them so much. Yet my nephew is smacked  and I can see how unresponsive it is for him and feel that a time out would fix a lot of his issues if only his parents were bothered to enforce them.

I don't resent my mum for smacking me. It was always explained that that was going to be the outcome and when I had calmed down and everything was over my mum would sit down with me and we would talk about our actions. She wouldn't say sorry for smacking be because it wasn't a reaction but an expressed punishment"

There are no rules yet about going to food courts. All take away is open. That's every maccas and kfc. People touching tables and chairs.

The issue is people walking around in face marks thinking they're safe. Touching everything and then rubbing an itchy eye. Well done for wearing a mask. You've proven you're a fool who has no idea.
