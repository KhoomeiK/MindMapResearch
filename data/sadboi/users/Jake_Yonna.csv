I closed my eyes for a second and when I opened them I had an hallucination where I saw the trees and it's inner energy, the animals, and humans. I felt so connected and so much love for everything that I got really overwhelmed. That feeling and view of people and all creatures lasted a few days and since then I've never felt it again.
