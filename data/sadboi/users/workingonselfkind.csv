You are not on day 1 again. You have 8+ months of recovery- not entirely made up of continuous sobriety.

If you are thinking about picking up, I would ask yourself why you stopped. You can always go back and drink, if that works better for you. I would give it more than a week. You know life is shit when you drink, and you have experienced that life is still shit after 7 days. There are no guarantees but maybe at 10 or 14 days life won’t be as bad."

It’s really hard and some days I want to give up because everything seems so gray. But I have to believe that alcohol won’t make this situation better. It might distract me for a little while but I will feel worse- time after time I have proven this to myself. I too just don’t want to feel the way I do now.

dryalcoholics,flx3u3f,t3_frnb04,1585574402.0,I believe it has something to do with detoxing. I believe it is related to your body’s receptors for feeing being out of whack. It happened to me but it only lasted a few days and it was early on (like week 1). This might be another condition. Or dry skin?
