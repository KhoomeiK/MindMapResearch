kratom,fl6byq1,t3_fmku38,1584862058.0,"I've experienced that for a short period of time. HOWEVER, I was taking extremely high doses of one of the upper strains because i had just gotten sober and was trying to cope. 

I was also at a point in my life with extreme stress and anxiety. Add that on top of taking the wrong strain (probably either lazy or money) in very high doses. I was chasing that feeling most likely. 

After several days of little to no sleep, I did start getting paranoid. Now to say its caused BY kratom itself, is far fetched and not true IMO. (I was scared someone was watching me. I was constantly scared of things that ""could"" happen. This psychosis, I believe, was directly from so many sleepless nights.) Anything in excess can be dangerous.

I've read that you can have anxiety alone that will give you bad insomnia. Not only that but I was trying to deal with withdrawal. 

I'm a huge kratom supporter and I've only had that experience which lasted me a few days within the 2 years I've been taking it. I think most of the problem was the errors i had made. I should've chose a different strain for night time and i shouldn't have been taking so much of it. I think at the time I felt like the more I took, the better I'd feel. LOL. I've noticed smaller doses more frequently work much better for me personally. This may be the opposite for others, everyone's different."
Anxiety,fimwgs3,t3_f8kkkl,1582549239.0,"Im so relieved to see that there are so many other people who feel the same way I do... I had no idea how to explain why I never wanted to sleep but I've done it for years. Lately with my anxiety being the worst it's ever been, I haven't been able to sleep at night for a long time. Sometimes I've tried and it's insomnia bur lately ive given up and I just don't feel tired at night. I want to do what I enjoy since all day the anxiety is constant. During the day im always sooo exhausted though."
onions,fi7etqd,t1_fi7c7j1,1582220015.0,"In my post, I mentioned something about with the FBI being involved. So I figured there was nothing else I could find. It's been really urking me for awhile so I figured it wouldn't hurt to see if anyone had ideas. 

And of course the fact that its my city and everyone's just decided to forget about it. While all those corrupt  cops and politicians go on like nothing happened... i guess I'm just naive.. :( the whole outcome sucks..

But hey, it's a very fascinating story to read about that's for sure! It's 2020 and I had no clue all that was going on for so long. Pretty crazy. Maybe some day something will come out..."
onions,fi788w9,t3_f63yg9,1582216301.0,"I've been desperately trying to find anymore info about the ongoing corruption mainly in the Las Vegas Metro Police Department amongst SO many others like the Las Vegas FBI division, DA attorneys, the judges, and the list goes on and on. Cops working with local pimp Molly Mall. Many of them were getting paid from Molly Moll to convince local prostitutes to lie under oath about rival pimps in order to put them away in prison for a long time. 

My point is - Ocean Fleming, one of the rival local pimps of Molly Moll was just let go recently A FREE MAN. Why? Ocean Fleming's lawyer threatened to have boxes and boxes of evidence that would expose all the corruption and incriminate so many cops and many more. So what did the judge do? He had so much more time to do and they threw it all out. No cops got in any trouble what so ever. I understand the sheriff has a reputation to uphold but the whole thing stinks. And there's way more to this. In a related case, two kids lost their lives, got shot in the head. Somehow there was no bullet in the evidence but it showed up later on when detectives went back to the crime scene...

ANYWAYS... This has been driving me crazy. I've read so many articles. No one here in Vegas seems to know that this ever happened. Or no one talks about it. I need info.

I just recently started getting on the dark web and it dawned on me, maybe i could find SOMETHING anything hidden about this. I know this isn't a government link but it definitely involves the government. And like the original post, i want to find something classified, important, and secret.

Can anyone give me any ideas of where I would even start? Or what would i even type in? It sounds like a huge conspiracy because of everyone involved but if you haven't read about it (the investigation happened a long time ago, but Ocean Flemming was just released. While Molly Moll is just now being arrested with a slap on the wrist!!!)

The FBI probe wouldn't release info on the LVMPD corruption so isn't it safe to say if the FBI is in on it, then I'll never find anything? Even on the dark web?

Advice? Or anything helps! I've lost sleep reading all the countless articles about all the major people that were involved. Somehow even the judges daughter's were being pimped out as well as cop's daughter's.  YES I KNOW THIS KIND OF SHIT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE. I get it. But as you can see by the huge story I just wrote, this is an extremely interesting story. Also very disturbing when you don't know who to trust when it's in your own city. (I live in Vegas.) Idk why but I can't get this out of my mind."
