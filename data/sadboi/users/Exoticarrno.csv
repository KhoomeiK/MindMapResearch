She just got back to me and I don’t think she minds and I feel like a wreck. I’m still shaking hyperventilating I’m fucking crying and i don’t know.

Thanks for taking your time to read my comment"
depression,fa2j08i,t3_e7powq,1575782676.0,"Hey man. 

Over the past two months I’ve finally been doing better. I’ve started going to school again and trying a bit. My grades came back up and what ever. I’ve been going out being social having fun and actually enjoying myself. I’ve got a new best friend who pretty much has done all this she’s just helped me so much. She became my best friend on Snapchat and tommorow we hit 100 streaks and the two month best friend emoji if you know what I’m talking about and she hasn’t been very active i the past few days but I’ve been on like 24/7 and another one of my food friends became my best friend a day before I got the two month best friend thing (I really hope you know what I’m talking about) and she hasn’t seen it yet but I feel so bad.

I haven’t seen a doctor or anything but I thought I’ve had anxiety for a while now but since I’ve met her it’s gone away a bit. But right now I’m litterally shaking and breathing rally heavily and I don’t know I think I’m going to cry and I feel so pathetic because this is all over my best friend dropping one spot down in my Snapchat best friends list and I sont know what I’m going to do.

Sorry for bothering you."

teenagers,f0aiq63,t3_d4b4h9,1568515207.0,"This is very relatable.
One of the things my parents do is get up me for something stupid or when they’re wrong about something ect I try to add my opinion or say something even unrelated and it’s backchatting. I can’t even say anything without getting in trouble even if they are wrong and it pisses me off.

Another thing is (I’m 14) and I say that I can’t wait to move out to my own place but “I’ll hate it because it’s hard to manage money and have responsibilities” I don’t care freedom is worth the effort. 

Next thing one of my chores is mowing the lawn and when I started I asked my mum how much I should be paid to mow and she said I should be paid $10 (Aud) for hours of work when she is happy to pay a ‘professional’ lawn mower $150 and the only reason I can’t be payed any higher is because I don’t need that money at my age but I’m trying to save for so many things at once but also have to spend my money for any thing little I want (actually reasonable) and I’m always told that spending my money on small things is stupid because I should be trying to save for something bigger (like a new pc) but I’m forced to do it. I’m told that I can’t manage my own money and it’s so annoying.

One thing I’ve seen in these comments is how missing one piece of homework means I should be grounded when it’s literally a waste of time and is u related to what I’m learning. Something I hate in school is that “we will use this when we’re older” other than certain situations when am I going to need to know that certain sizes of lines in rocks means it’s a different rock, like can’t you teach me important things like taxes, time management, money management ect. I don’t think something that I will never use decides how far I can go in life it’s bs.

One more topic is that (as I mentioned earlier I’m saving for a pc) my dad was willing to go halves with me to buy a new MacBook for school (he said he was going to but me one for grade 7 and when the time came he said he would buy me one before grade 8 and then when that came he said he will pay for half) and he would go halves with me to buy and iMac because he bought himself one but if I build one that’s the EXACT SAME PRICE but I get to learn how to do it, learn about the parts and things and get a better computer he won’t go halves with me like wtf and his only reason is because I’ll use it to play games but I would do that on an iMac if I got one. Also my mum wouldn’t go halves with me on a pc because I don’t need more video games and shouldn’t spend that money on videogames but I’ll use it for school as well for years and it gives me a responsibility to save for it and to manage my money while saving.

Overall being 14 is so good but so bad, I don’t have much homework yet and have slight freedom but I’m treated like a child and told to act like I’m 18 and living by myself. If you’ve read this far hope you enjoyed my little rant."
