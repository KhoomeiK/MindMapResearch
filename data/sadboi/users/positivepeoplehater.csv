I have turned to science to help ease my obsession with it. The numbers in the country, my state, my local towns vs overall population. Especially for my age group and sex. For example, when I realized only 5000 women in my age group had it across the entire country, I felt reassured. Despite my being in a higher risk group bc of obesity, I know the odds are I won‚Äôt get it. I still follow public health recommendations and as things relax around here tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to be watching the news closely in the next couple weeks for how much cases increase. 

I will not be going anywhere there‚Äôs lots of people, like Walmart was insane yesterday AND 1/3 of people didn‚Äôt have their noses covered (DUH) but outdoors where I can keep distance without a mask? I‚Äôll be there.

The first thing I want to say, that I wish I knew in my darkest moments, is that it won‚Äôt always be this way. I had depression and anxiety, both steadily increasing for years, and then things finally broke through and I feel like a normal person these days. 

The second thing is NONE of this is your fault. Not one piece. Nothing you feel or think or have or haven‚Äôt done. None. You were raised by two parents who were SEVERELY dysfunctional and incapable of giving you what a human NEEDS to not feel horribly, awfully, shitty. 

Those feelings you have, that pain and worthlessness and desperation is a completely normal reaction to abuse. The only way we survive is to grow reactions and processes that help us get through it. As a child in this situation, growth is limited, ability to process things changes because those ‚Äúthings‚Äù aren‚Äôt normal. Our brain and body react to the danger we grew up with to help us survive, not grow. 

The good news- and there is good news. Studies show more and more that our brains are elastic and we can develop new neural pathways. There are treatments that are increasingly successful and helpful for cptsd. 

Those feelings you have - feeling lost, hopeless, scared, confused, incapable, incompetent, worse than others - many if not all of us here have felt them too, because that‚Äôs what our brains do in response to repeated trauma. It‚Äôs not your fault. 

There is treatment. The hard part is it‚Äôs usually slow and requires a good bit of attention and patience. 

Suggestions - 

therapy if you can. Find someone familiar with cptsd or trauma, someone validating and accepting and patient. 

Reading can provide solace, validation and information. 
Complex PTSD: From surviving to thriving by Pete Walker
ACA big red book (adult children of alcoholics and other dysfunctions) Take or leave the 12 step stuff, the book was the first I read that accurately described my deep feelings. 

I‚Äôm sure other people have good suggestions too. There‚Äôs tons of shorter things online to help you relate and identify. 

12 step groups or cptsd groups or trauma groups or anything like that. There are online and phone meetings, which imo suck compared to in person, but may be your thing.

Regarding work: make a resume. You don‚Äôt have to do anything with it, just make one. Just out of college nobody cares what other activities you have done. They just want to know you have a degree. 

More importantly: I learned as I got older that I was FAR more capable than I ever thought.

*Also, and maybe most important, other people are far less capable than they seem. Ha. I thought people knew what they were doing, felt confident, knew how to do certain jobs - when in fact we all are bumbling through, just doing what we can. Yes you develop skill sets, but work is WAY easier than it seems when you haven‚Äôt really worked in a profession yet. 

If you want to chat more I‚Äôm game. 

Lastly, I want to say, and I know this to be true: you will be ok. You will. We are wired to grow. Even with the shitty, messed up wiring we developed from dealing with traumatic abuse, our brains keep moving toward growth. That means learning, opening, and healing."

3- It‚Äôs uncommon and weird. 

Nope. See #1 :)


When I moved into my current apartment they were asking $1200. I asked if I could pay $1000 instead, they agreed and 7 years later I‚Äôm only up to $1140. 

Most landlords want someone good over a lot of money, especially people who rent themselves vs a company. 

Happy to offer any tips on how to ask if you like!!"
