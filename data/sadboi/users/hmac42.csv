I think my fellow freedom fighters here might agree that the things you just suggested (in good faith, and I thank you) sound about as possible as laying your own chocolate eggs.

In seriousness though, the only places you can legitimately just turn up at are crisis centers who just triage for suicide and then curb you in > 24 hrs with a referral to the aforementioned overbooked MSW, and that's IF they take your specific type of insurance, IF you have it. I hear what you're saying about walls but...you may have heard, we make them long and spiky here. üò£"

I'm feeling the same way as one post up, and I'm curious what your process was and how you avoided the typical make-10-phone-calls-and-wait-3-weeks-just-to-get-to-one-shitty-MSW-with-no-social-skills story."
depression,fpc0k8t,t3_gckuo4,1588483840.0,"My guess is, they know you're in pain and don't know what to do about it.  Someone I'm fairly close with messaged me to ask how I was a couple days ago and in the interest of doing away with stupid social niceties, I answered ""honestly, pretty shitty"" and she read it and disappeared.    


We're so used to being ""fine""d by everyone we talk to that we don't know how to sack up and have a real conversation anymore. 

So, not that it's better than not reciprocated, but I think the people who love you are probably scared rather than apathetic."

starbucks,f58rxkw,t3_dn8i1i,1572062633.0,"You will mess up.  Then that customer will either get mad and you'll fix it, or they'll be fine and you'll fix it, or not even know because it was a small ""add sauce vs add syrup"" thing, and either way you won't die.  I promise.  :) 

After that, that mistake will be the one mistake you won't ever make again, and you'll keep learning until you make fewer and then almost no mistakes.  

As for the drinks, everything is so automated that once you get the basic 3-4-5(6) 1-2-2 rules down, they're actually pretty hard to mess up if you're paying attention. 

The main thing is to show up, CARE, smile and try.  It's really hard to get mad at anyone doing those things, even if they make a mistake."

I mean, by this logic (I know it's a stretch to compare a week to a year, but) they could give me ""48 hours notice"" of intent to enter anytime between two days from the notice and the expiration of my lease, ya know?  I'm just saying, blocking off an entire week of possible entry doesn't seem like it's in the spirit of notice."

I'm not a lawyer so I can't give legal advice (although in America children absolutely do legally emancipate themselves or call CPS on their own behalves, so it's not unheard of, though I don't know what Australia has in the way of that), but I just had to come here and say a) I'm sorry you're in a place that's so dark you have to run from it, and b) don't let these assbot commenters tell you to 'stick it out' or that 'it's not that bad.'  Abuse is real, Jehovah's Witnesses can be terrifying, and parents don't have to be in your life if they're ruining it.

I'm sorry you came here for advice just to get shit on more.  I hope everything gets better."
