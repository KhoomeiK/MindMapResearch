BPD,fna6pgq,t3_g0eogj,1586792063.0,"100% it’s so annoying because i never know what is something i genuinely want to pursue in life or what is a spike a mood for a while.. i have a lot of interests, but they only last so long then they get dropped and i become a shell of a being for a bit. then it’s like HEY ALL OF YOUR INTERESTS ARE BACK DO THEM ALL RIGHT NOW. an exhausting cycle i can’t keep up with. but on the positive end i would take a manic day over a depressed any day honestly. but yeah i could use some balance👏🏻"
Dermatillomania,fmzqbfr,t1_fmy978f,1586527254.0,"yeah, that’s a good plan for sure! i appreciate your positivity:) do you have any tips for starting to resist?"
Dermatillomania,fmwz4tl,t1_fmumw26,1586455587.0,i can look into another ent or try and have a plastic surgeon look at it but then i would have to pay out of pocket.. but it might have to be done in future if i can save up for it. the surgeon i saw didn’t really give me any background just said it was unfixable so it would be good to get a second opinion but the waitlist for ENT surgeons is super long
BPD,fmr5kfc,t1_fmpv3i1,1586314395.0,"you’re not crazy, he’s literally not listening nor understanding. he’s just gotta get it through his skull yknow. she’s in the past, you’re present. she should be long gone by now"
BPD,fmr5dcd,t3_fwqo7c,1586314261.0,"to text your ex for a place to stay is breaking boundaries and out of line on her part. & by even texting her back to an extent is a big no on his. he should listen, understand where you’re coming from, and then block the b. like byeeeeee. been in a similar position dude. hope this is resolved, sending love."
BPD,fmr4xhm,t3_fwunrm,1586313969.0,i can only remember tiny bits of my childhood and those memories aren’t v good..
BPD,fmr4lql,t3_fwfsje,1586313754.0,"i’ve been pretty numb, left my boyfriend about a week ago we were only together a month and a half but i felt like i haven’t taken time to myself after my last relationship as well as be his only support. i’ve started a project to clean out my house. i finished my room and my mums room. and today i had a lil self care day and did my legs and feet since it’s been a while 😌"
BPD,fmnypoj,t1_fmnmfry,1586239333.0,OP came here for support not to be told they’re lacking self respect. we don’t know who they slept w or for what reasons and that’s their choice. it’s not anyone’s place to judge. you don’t know the headspace OP was in nor if OP was even coherent. blackout usually means you don’t remember your actions.
BPD,fmnvsf8,t3_fvuc8f,1586236728.0,"opposite for me personally, i feel like i start to lose myself because i become so consumed by the other persons life. even though the fear of abandonment is always there i tend to be the one who always leaves first. my last relationship didn’t last long at all bc he clung onto me and i felt suffocated, think i split bc when things ended i didn’t feel too much. that’s normally how it goes for me. being alone just seems to be the better option, no one gets hurt expect for me."
BPD,fifhc6a,t1_fifgtqs,1582389808.0,"yes!!! i’m so proud of you. i know how hard it can be to stop yourself before taking extreme measures, but you did it!"
BPD,fifaiqy,t3_f7mitv,1582387716.0,"i had an appointment w my therapist yesterday and she said it’s helpful to learn how to self validate and try to calm down before approaching a situation (i know this is very hard for us) but it’s worth a shot right. 

i find personally i go from blaming or extremely upset to apologizing for my actions afterwards. (i feel like you’re in the same boat, correct me if i’m wrong) 

if we sit with the thoughts, use the skills to calm down (STOP, ACCEPTS, pros and cons lists) then we can work towards being in wise mind when approaching the situation. she also noted that because it’s so hard for us to get our emotions across effectively it can be helpful to write down what we want to say beforehand. this way we can do it 3000 times before we feel it’s good then approach. 

know your feelings are valid, know there’s nothing wrong with who you are as a person, it’s just learning how to cope with our extreme emotions and effectively communicate what we need to others. 

sending lots of love."
BPD,fi94g42,t1_fi8s7nf,1582255331.0,"i feel you on this. it’s like i want a healthy stable relationship but i don’t know how to stop my behaviours and patterns from destroying it. i’m currently on a break from my fp. he initiated it, then i just kept lashing out. now i’m just focusing on myself. try and make yourself happy and find things you love to do. i know it’s hard but you’ll get through💕"
BPD,fi4x8wz,t1_fi3k790,1582150288.0,"it’s good he’s gotten into the habit and you’ve learned to not take it out on your SO, that shows a lot progress and strength dude! i know it’s still difficult to handle internally though, but know you’re making a difference"
BPD,fi4x43y,t1_fi32oft,1582150208.0,yeah i feel you on this for sure.. it’s tough:/
BPD,fi4x2mv,t1_fi47x9j,1582150185.0,yeah i know it’s not good it’s just hard to completely be like i’m done. because i don’t want to be. i want everything to work out .-. and ik at the end of the day i have to work on my shit too it’s not just him. it’s just so hard
BPD,fi2smse,t3_f63pk5,1582087924.0,"i get you. i’m in and out of a relationship right now where i put my all and never feel like enough is given back.. and i know it’s not their fault. at the same time it’s little things like text me back, let me know if you’re going to be busy so i can keep my obsessive brain at bay. it’s not fair to them i know but at the same time that’s what i need to feel ok. and if they don’t all hell breaks loose then i feel shit for accusations/starting arguments bc i feel abandoned. i really fucking love this disorder is INCREDIBLE."
BPD,fi2q22z,t3_f5twaw,1582085874.0,"yes 100%. it’s helped me make connections in certain situations but in others i’ve definitely felt the embarrassment. i kinda enjoy being an open book because i wanna have people in my life who are as open as i am but that seems to be my struggle is i always feel like people are closed off compared to myself. 

i would suggest embracing the openness you have, it’s not always a weakness. also, if it is something you really do want to change i’m sure practice w setting boundaries w specific people and gradually building up your list will help a lil. (i don’t have much experience w this personally though)"
BPD,fhns7bb,t3_f40js6,1581731743.0,yep they left me yesterday
BPD,fhnej96,t1_fhndoug,1581725701.0,i messaged u❤️
BPD,fhndax9,t1_fhncvzh,1581725225.0,you’re lucky to have someone who cares enough to do so for you. i feel like i’m being put last yet i know that’s not the case. i can’t even trust my own gut instincts anymore.. thank you for listening❤️
BPD,fhnc9q7,t1_fhnbzu1,1581724856.0,thank you❤️ i want to stop my horrible tendencies of blaming him and expecting him to just drop her but it feels so wrong
BPD,fhnbm3g,t1_fhml25w,1581724531.0,no i think you’re on the right track with letting her know you love her and that you’re still w her. if you ignore back that can go just as south. at least you let her know you’re understanding and will still be there when she’s feeling ok again. it’s not a nice headspace to be in when everything’s “black” for either person in the relationship
BPD,fhlqnod,t3_f3gzvk,1581703523.0,i feel like i can express my emotions but it never comes off as i want it to. with the constant fight between the emotional and rational part of my mind really messes w my communication. i try to express how i’m feeling yet how i feel i should be feeling or what i think i should be feeling. then the external factors always have me questioning whether it’s even correct or not so my words just come out all over the place and it’s like please understand what i’m saying😅
BPD,fgotds7,t3_ezprzb,1580985687.0,ty for this. my SO left me today. he said he wants us to both better but that my emotions are too much right now and he can’t handle being there for me. his lack of compassion is killing me. he says it won’t be forever but i don’t believe him bc he’s so hesitant so confusing. i just want him here but he wants nothing to do with me. and i want nothing to w life right now but that will kill him. fuck me.
BPD,fgoohko,t1_fgonuty,1580978681.0,Fellow scorp here as well i can’t STAND being told i’m dramatic. specially after explaining my disorder till my face turns blue on how i’m actually feeling this pain whether it’s rational or not.
BPD,fgoo7xg,t3_ezp3uf,1580978308.0,i feel like i’ve seen this post before 🤔
BPD,fgnezgy,t3_ezf64q,1580943447.0,"yes, especially with my SO. i’m aware he’s not big on texting but i also can’t help but feel like he never cares about our conversations considering i try to keep it going while he’s a dry texter. then if he’s not dry with other people i get extremely insecure and feel completely and utterly abandoned and that he’d rather be w someone else. i’ve started deleting all of convos and got off most socials"
BPD,fgn7hsa,t3_eze7tk,1580939153.0,"i feel you on this, i just deleted all my social media as well. it’s like there’s so many people there yet i feel so fucking lonely. i can never live up to the expectations of social media. sent me into a bad identity crisis. i felt a huge disconnect between who i was online and who i am irl. i just wanna be fulfilled with myself as a person not who i pretend to be."
BPD,fgn3vc7,t1_fglr28n,1580937201.0,"thank you for this. i tried to word it differently last night so i think he understands better now but he still doesn’t really want to talk about the subject. 

i haven’t actually written down the evidence for and against so i should try that. i did a behavioural analysis chart to get more in-site on my thoughts and try and stop impulsive behaviours (lashing out on him for the obsessing thoughts) 

thank you !"
BPD,fgicjaj,t3_eynxa4,1580816764.0,i’ve been on quetiapine for around 6 months. it’s definitely increased my mood. i can agree with the above comment though that if you miss a dose it can mess you up the next day. i take mine at bedtime as it helps w sleep. the only other thing to note is the first month i was on it i was extremely drowsy the next morning everyday.
BPD,fgic76u,t3_eynq79,1580816361.0,hey! still learning how to cope w this balance as well. i use A LOT of fact checking to make sure my thought process is rational and to try and stop the spiralling. it can be quite difficult to manage at some points but as long as you’re open w your triggers w your partner and you both learn how to work w each other’s needs you’ll be ok😌 i also find making sure keeping busy and having activities planned for while my SO needs time alone is also helpful. and trying to balance home based/and outside based activities (even if there little) so you’re both fulfilled when together! hope this was a lil bit of help
BPD,ffz1xa4,t3_evvd24,1580361317.0,needed this. struggling a lot w back and forth between knowing the facts and thinking my scenarios could be true or become true. im appreciative of this post a lot
BPD,ffpxpi5,t1_ffcmhpw,1580109963.0,yeah it’s really putting a strain on me and my relationship right now.
BPD,ffpinsz,t1_ff5chis,1580095960.0,"i also resonate w this. i do this a lot w hobbies and styles as well. so currently i’m obsessed with sfx makeup and filming it and it seems like it’s becoming an almost everyday thing. 

a bit ago i was really into buying and selling clothes to the point where i’d be meeting people to buy things then not like it a few days later to just sell it."
BPD,ffpfgf0,t3_eudwed,1580093729.0,"i haven’t quite figured this out either, but i’m curious if when you split you start focusing on yourself? that’s been the case for me. it seems to be a cycle of giving my all then taking it back.."
