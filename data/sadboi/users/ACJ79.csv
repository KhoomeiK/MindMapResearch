Parenting,execlgl,t3_csen8d,1566209437.0,"I understand grandparents use pictures of their grandkids in profile pictures, this picture isn’t just of her grandkids, it’s of my husband, me and my kids. We paid money for it and my husband wanted to use it as his profile picture but can’t as we have so many mutual contacts it will just be confusing. We are proud of our family and wanted to post it, but she just took it and now everyone is complementing her. I also think at quick glance people think it’s my profile. I think someone’s profile picture should be of them. 

In regards to the person who said “beautiful family”. They were saying that to me as it’s (a) my family, and (b) a picture I posted to my own profile. If she posted it on her profile okay, no problem, we are her family too, but to me it was overstepping. It’s kind of like someone asking you a question and your parent answering for you. 

The reason it’s bothering me is I feel my mom has been too involved in my life sometimes. I wanted to see if this seems odd to people. To me it’s odd. I wouldn’t take a picture of her and my kids and make it my profile picture, especially if she took the photo...it’s just strange."

toddlers,ex9l3xs,t3_crpun1,1566090493.0,"Not sure I can be much of a help. My daughter is 3 and I always found she napped so easily at daycare but not for me. I wonder if it’s fear of missing out kind of thing? You’re home, it’s a different routine and he just wants to be with you? 

Have you done any kind of sleep training? How long was he in his crib crying before your husband went in? Maybe do Ferber method for naps (he’s still young enough)."
toddlers,ex9kcgh,t3_crqcwm,1566090175.0,I’ve heard it’s normal for them to back track a bit after an illness. I would go naked for a few days and see if that helps her get back on track.
Postpartum_Depression,ex7zzff,t3_crnr13,1566066973.0,"It definitely sounds like more is going on than just Postpartum Depression. Is your youngest child 2? If so it that’s a long time for PPD to hang around (though it’s possible). There is actually something called Postpartum Rage where people get very angry (just another way Depression can manifest).

The fact that she is not sleeping and that it has happened before having children strongly points to bipolar. In people with bipolar during a manic episode they can get really angry as opposed to just “high”. There are other illnesses too. 

I currently have Postpartum Depression and Anxiety and I also have Borderline Personality Disorder. The BPD became manageable after doing the right therapy and I was able to go off all medication. I stayed off it after having my first child, even though my moods were bad at times. I had to go back on medication after my last pregnancy (twins, way higher hormone levels, way harder everything. I don’t feel overly depressed, it’s the anxiety and anger that has been getting the better of me and made me go to the doctor. I found myself yelling at my 3 year old once to often and that’s NOT the kind of mom I want to be. 

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. It must be very hard. Your wife definitely needs help-more than just sleeping pills. I hope she will get help.

I also want to add I’d avoid the BPDlovedones subreddit that someone else mentioned. Your wife has not been diagnosed with BPD. It’s an extremely complex disorder and manifests very differently in different people yet groups like this tend to stereotype all people with disease into one because they’ve been hurt by people with BPD."

BorderlinePDisorder,ex2wqw9,t3_cr7vtb,1565976541.0,"I struggle a lot with anger, especially in regards to others actions that I feel are not in line with my own morals etc.

Here’s the deal about the cupcake. At face value your sister ate a cupcake. That was what happened. You are putting judgement into it. Your sister was inconsiderate and ate your cupcake. It’s that “inconsiderate” that is the problem. She was inconsiderate TO YOU as well. It’s like when someone tailgates me. It annoys me to no end.The situation is this-someone is following my car to what I deem to be too closely-that’s the action that is happening. I interpret it as the tailgater is trying to push me to go faster. If I were to slam on my breaks right now they’d rear end me hurting my children (blood boils thinking of that). They are a BAD person for tailgating. How can they not see that tailgating is wrong? What is wrong with them? Again-reality is, there is a car behind me that may be a little too close. I put judgement on the situation and get losses off. 

With BPD we judge a lot of the time.  It’s called something in DBT-I think just non-judgement. We have very strong opinions on what is right and wrong and when someone does something we deem wrong we get pissed and take it personally. The tailgater May be in a hurry, they may not see themselves as actually tailgating. They are NOT tailgating ME to threaten the lives of my kids, they may be an inconsiderate asshole but it’s not just about ME. They probably tailgate everyone but I’m taking it personally that they are doing something TO ME.

I hope that makes sense."

I see you’re looking for more substantial responses so I’ll elaborate. I struggled in school because of my ADHD and learning disabilities. I started to do well in high school so I went to university where I really struggled. In university my mom told me my IQ was in the 140’s, so I thought I was really smart I spite of doing poor in school. I thought I was really “deep” etc. 

Now I’m almost 42 and feel like a failure, okay maybe not that harsh. One of my children got really ill shortly after birth so he has seen a lot of doctors, med students etc. I’m envious of them. I wish I had done more with my life. I was always dazed in university. Those doctors probably studied their asses off while I was slacking because I couldn’t focus. I hate ADHD because I feel it robbed me of so much. 

Now I have 3 young children (including infant twins). My life is all about them. My job has become boring and doesn’t challenge me. I haven’t read anything intelligent in years. I use to read philosophy and stuff. I don’t really think I’m as smart as I use to think I was. I think I’m maybe slightly above average but that’s it. Maybe it’s age, maybe it’s being a parent.

clothdiaps,es1zxqo,t1_erz2788,1561510250.0,Yep (but thanks for asking ‘cause that would have been funny if it was that)
adhd_anxiety,ertvu8a,t3_c3xl23,1561254826.0,"It changes over time, I find. It was really bad when I was a kid, hit better in high school, bad again in university and then at different points in my life it has seemed worse. I have struggled with anxiety and depression at times so when they are bad my ADHD symptoms seem worse. If I am stressed or sleep deprived they are worse. I have young children right now including 7 month old twins who do not sleep well. I get on average 4-6 hours of constantly interrupted sleep a night. My ADHD symptoms are off the charts because I’m so sleep deprived."

Parenting,erawnwd,t3_c133pw,1560654779.0,"Have you ever tried to scare her when she zoned out or make a loud noise? I imagine she’s just zoning out, I think it’s pretty normal. There is a type of seizure called an Absence Seizure where it looks like the person is zoning out but they are actually having a seizure. If she doesn’t respond to say clapping or you dropping something loud, then you definitely should talk to a doctor. Again, I think she’s just zoning out, but you never know."
Parenting,eravudy,t3_c11eky,1560654189.0,"I really like the book “Oh Crap! Potty Training” by Jamie Glowacki. My daughter is almost three, and not 100% trained yet. I had her go naked around the house and she got it within two days. The main issue we have now is that she still wears a pull-up to daycare and it sets her back. When they are wearing pull-ups they don’t get the sensation, but when they start peeing down their legs they do.

It could be hard if he has ADHD. I find my daughter still has accidents when she’s distracted by something. Have you googled potty training s child with ADHD or a hyperactive or even a spirit child? Maybe there are some tips. 

Good luck :-)"
