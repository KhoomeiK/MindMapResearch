BPD,fo1c8vu,t1_fo14s1j,1587430158.0,"Well, that depends on why someone is faking. One answer could be attention, and pretending to have a chronic illness is a very unhealthy way of trying to get attention. That signifies emotional dysfunction and having missed learning an important skill in childhood, a skill that therapy (hopefully) can teach."
BPD,fo0e5s7,t3_g4ritc,1587411428.0,"Let me put it this way: if someone fakes a mental illness, that’s indicative of a serious mental issue. It’s highly unlikely that you’re faking, but even if you were that still means you have mental health issues you need to address."

EDAnonymous,ey02fky,t3_cuw7c7,1566673462.0,"Okay here’s my go-to recipe:

Soak the paper overnight in water so the fiber is more easily digestible. Then put it in the oven at 500 degrees for an hour. It won’t catch on fire because the fibers broke down. Then sprinkle salt on it (not too much or else you’ll gain 25lbs!!!) and eat it with chopsticks so I don’t gobble it down too quickly. Cheers fellow butterfly xxx"

EatCheapAndHealthy,es826fp,t3_c6b5lf,1561686086.0,"Veggie burgers!

Ingredients:
1 can (1.75 cups) black beans
0.25 cups corn
0.25 cups spinach 
0.25 cups mushrooms 
3 cherry tomatoes

Feel free to omit/add veggies to suit your palate/budget but make sure it’s mostly beans or rice or else it won’t stick together very well. Mash everything together, form into patties, heat the oven to about a 4/10, and cook on each side for four minutes. You can use them in burgers, eat them on their own, or crumble them up and serve over rice with a sauce of choice!"
cookingforbeginners,es80ysf,t1_es7zyh0,1561685242.0,"No problem! Going back to the food processor, you can make low calorie smoothies if you use mostly vegetables like spinach, carrot or cucumber then add berries to mask the taste (I find you only need a few berries whereas you’d need more, say, banana). Then add a splash of almond milk or water and blend it all up! Another good way to incorporate veggies is to add them to eggs (or tofu scramble if you prefer) to bulk it up. Then of course there’s the classic making pizza with a flour tortilla, you can find some for 60-70 calories then add some marinara sauce, a bit of cheese, and load up on things like spinach, mushroom, and tomato."
cookingforbeginners,es7zp7e,t3_c6dn15,1561684344.0,"100 calorie veggie burgers:

Ingredients:
1 can (1.75 cups) black beans
0.25 cups corn
0.25 cups spinach 
0.25 cups mushrooms 
3 cherry tomatoes

Split into five patties, heat the stove to about 4/10 and cook for 4 minutes on each side. Feel free to omit/add veggies, but make sure it’s mostly beans or rice or else it won’t stick together very well.

As for other suggestions, cauliflower rice is awesome and easy to make if you have a food processor. Portobello mushroom caps make a great steak substitute, and I like them stuffed with parmesan. To cook those, just put them in the oven at 450F for 20 minutes."
