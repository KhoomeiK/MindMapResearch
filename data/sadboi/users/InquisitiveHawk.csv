The thing is, I recognized from the start I was having an irrational response to a rational trigger, and to me at the time I either told myself or felt like I had two choices (amygdala response) I could either rage into an anger I'd never felt before or try and get away, but I couldn't do either, cue panic attack.

My involuntary breathing became shallow, and the physiological responses followed. Dizziness, lightheaded, feather light feeling, etc.

As long as they're not triggers for you, I highly suggest reading into what the body physically does and the things that happen because of that.

Remember though, it will pass, breathe deep, slow exhale, and grounding. Talk to yourself out loud if you're unable to talk to anyone else."

There are plenty of reasons why you could have a difficult time connecting with people.

I have social anxiety, and the less I socialize the greater that anxiety can become. Because as with all things in life, we have to practice at things. Some are more talented or gifted in certain avenues in life and require less practice or they're inherently just natural at it.

Being homeschooled, it's very possible you just need practice with individuals outside of your ""homeschool"" environment.

Some parents use homeschooling to keep control of their child and what they are exposed to and how they look at the world, you're on the internet, so I'm hoping you don't fall into this category.

Either way, find something you enjoy doing, let's say history?! Because I myself started out in my hobbies because of my enjoyment of history. So I researched history based hobbies.
