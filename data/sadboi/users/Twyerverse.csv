How it started, what new symptoms and body aches came up each day, until you went into the hospital and then talk about how the staff greeted you, cared for you, how they were dressed.  If they seemed tense around you.  I mean it would make a great short story, and you could probably share it with the networks, so others could get a true first hand account of a young 20-something person's fight for life.

The B blood group and O blood group caught it the easiest but had milder symptoms.  The A group and AB group, had a harder chance of getting infected but if infected had more severe symptoms.

If they deliver alcohol, they have to scan you I D and have you sign something on their phone which is not social distancing friendly.

I think all delivery people should wear masks and gloves when  making deliveries, have hand sanitizer and wash their hands before and after every delivery, if not wearing gloves.

While we’re in the subject grocery stores should figure out a way to close their lobbies to the public to ensure their products aren’t tainted by asymptomatic shoppers.

The public needs to have assurances that all groceries being delivered have been or are sanitized prior to winding up in instacarts workers vehicles and the vehicles themselves should have some way to keep groceries secure prior to delivery.
