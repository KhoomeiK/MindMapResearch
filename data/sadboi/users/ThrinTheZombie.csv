Let me set the scene for you. You walk in to this freaking shed/hut looking place, with a bubbling cauldron in the corner near the back door, theres a wall behind you full of weird shit in jars, there's a little table draped with linens with a herby looking centerpiece over in the other corner, and in the middle of the floor is a frickin *coffin*.

You walk in and get a half second to absorb the scene until a witch, like creepy ass long black robe, hat, and a huge huge nose, comes hobbling towards you, talking like Shrek, ""wot yhu doin in ma swamp?"" She asks you if you want to raise the dead with her. *Of course* you do. The witch starts taking things off the shelf. She makes you take some eyeballs out of a jar, she makes you get some sand, she gathers some other shit, and she walks you over to the cauldron. She tells you to throw the eyeballs in, you do. She tells you to throw the sand in, you do. She takes out a watch, and says it's about time, *ha!* As she throws it in, the cauldron bubbles and glows and she cackles.

The witch takes a cup of the brew from the cauldron, and hands it to you. The witch brings you over in front of the coffin, and she swiftly moves around behind it, so that when the coffin opened, it opens towards you. She says an incantation and tells you to pour the brew onto the coffin. You hesitate, because *do you* want to wake the dead? You're not so sure anymore. But she urges you to hurry, the spell is fading! You must do it now! So you do it. But... nothing happens. The witch tells you to open the coffin. You bend down and open it, and you realize the coffin was *empty*.

A zombie pops out from under the table! It comes after you until the witch performs another spell and compels it back into the coffin. The witch politely shows you to the door and bids you good night.

Anyway, I was the zombie (and then later I was the witch). When I was the zombie, my favorite was this group of black ladies who were so scared anyways and then when the zombie came out, one of them tipped over and knocked over her friends like bowling pins. It was sooooo funny. And second favorite, a very short marine looking guy put up his elbow to ward be off because he was scared.

I loved working at a haunted house.

Bonus story, I was also in the psych ward section of the haunted house at a different time and I got to scream at people that I was going to rip off their skin and wear it. AND I got to be the victim in a torture chamber where he pretended to saw my chest open and then punch out my heart. It was fucking awesome. That role was absolutely my favorite."
