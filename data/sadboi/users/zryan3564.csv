QuickThoughts,fqfkvze,t1_fqfjgjs,1589326733.0,I think you misunderstood what survey sites are. They aren't a way to get rich fast or to have a career. It's so people get a little extra spending cash for answering questions. $1 per survey is still more than most survey sites I know. That's why I like QT so much. People have made a living doing surveys but they hit up 20+ survey sites a day.  If you don't think it's enough then don't do it. No one is forcing you.  For me sitting watching TV and answering a few questions is fine with me. I don't fo any surveys over 15 mins. Just don't like the longer ones.   That being said I have had other offers come to me while doing QT. I had a university contact me to do a month long study that paid $150. All I had to do is long on once a day for 30 days and answer 5 questions. I'll take that any day.

If you do have a skill you can sign up on Fiverr where people will pay you to do anything from artwork to designing to writing essays.  There are a lot more job than that so I would check it out and see if there is anything listed you might be able to do. 

Next you could try online surveys. There are sites like Mturk, prolific, QuickThoughts and many more. Mturk is actually an Amazon small task site. They pay you to take survey or do simple tasks.  Most survey site pay from a few cents to some rarer site a few dollars.  Take QuickThoughts. It's an app you can download. Depending on where you live you will either get 5  $1 surveys to do a day or 5 $2 surveys. When I signed up I got $2 surveys. I was making $10 a day and reached the $599 limit in 2 months. Once you reach the limit you need to send in a w9 tax form so you can pay taxes on the income you make from the app. Unfortunately after I reach my limit they dropped me down to $1 surveys. Others haven't had that happen so I'm not sure why. QT pays in Amazon gift card and other survey sites you can pick what gift card you want. So if you want to fill your bank account you would have to sell the gift cards you get. There are some site that give you money but they take forever to earn the $20 you need to cash out.

Lastly you could start a business. Esty.com is a good place If you are good at making things. You could make your own website and sell anything you want. Just think of what you want to sell and go from there. Thinking of things to sell is the hard part in my opinion. I wish you the best."

I thought I would try a headbutt since I saw plenty of movies where it would put the guy down. I didn't realize they were headbutting the enemy's nose so I head-butted the kid in the forehead. He just stood there looking more pissed. Then he picked me up and dropped me on my side. The next day he had a huge bruise on his forehead so we laughed about it.  So there are 2 more suggestions. Don't use moves you saw on a movie and two headbutt the person on the bridge of their nose and not the forehead if you decide to do that."
