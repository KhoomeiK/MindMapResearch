AskProgramming,fn17n82,t3_fylmyd,1586556408.0,"For people with anxiety, it's common to jump around a lot of topics and to feel overwhelmed. There are many reason why this could happen. Maybe you want to be more competitive than other candidates. Maybe you get discouraged when something gets too difficult. Maybe 

At the end of the day, the market rewards being aware of a lot of topics and matters. It's useful to know how a database works even if you're just doing front-end through APIs. 

But today's workplace can very often rewards _specialization_. A Kubernetes specialist. Or Haskell. Or embedded systems. Or SRE. Or Cassandra. Jenkins. Etc. 

So you need to be organized, and make a plan. This is how I've done it: 

First, CAPTURE. open a Google Sheets document and list _evweything_ you're interested in. Sort in through categories. Constantly add any new ideas. If it's on the paper (or electronic document) means it's not in your head. 

Then, DEFINE what your goal is. Decide what you want to focus on. What is your goal? What are your dreams? Look at job offers online. This will give you proof that what you're learning matters. It will also give you a checklist of things that are needed together. E.g. C++ often goes together with X or Y technology. Also, C++ is not going away in the next 50 years. Languages evolve, and grow techniques and functionality and paradigms over time. Also, once you learn a language well, it's pretty easy to move to another. 90% carries over. 

Then PRIORITIZE.  You don't need to learn everything _now_. You can stagger your learning over years. You can use color-coding. Red background for what is immediate, pink for what is lowest priority, white for what's lowest. 

Now PLAN. You have a list of domains you want to get better at. Now define a plan for each of those domains. What are the different ways to get better? Again, list all the options. Build a sample project. Read that book. Listen to that udemy tutorial. Do one hour of leetcode a say. 

Then EXECUTE. Define a daily routine. Start by just doing one thing a day. If it works, add another. If it doesn't, reduce the goal. Make to goal so small that it becomes ridiculous. I've had times in my life that my only goal for the day was to find a phone bill that I lost. It wasn't even to pay the bill. Just to find it, so maybe I can pay it the next day. Sometimes, life is hard, and we need to acknowledge it and adapt to it. 

REWARD yourself. Every time you do your goal, pick a reward. Videogames, sweets, cup of coffee, order food online, anything you like. Pat yourself in the back, however small it seems. Pick some dates so your can track yourself over time. 

Finally, UPDATE. Sometimes, priorities change. This promising programming language actually has a huge issue you were not aware about. Or some concept you wanted to learn is actually something else entirely, and suddenly it doesn't fit your goals anymore. Don't be afraid to make change, deprioritize things, add some others, etc. But ask yourself if you're doing it for the right reasons, or you're just afraid of something and making up a reason. 

Good luck!

Edit: if you're in school, you should focus on your classes.  Maybe you're just afraid of being compared to peers, or having bad grades, or insecure, hence you find all kinds of ways to distract yourself. Until graduation, ignore all the noise. When school is over, you're going to have all the time in the world to learn what you want."

Put some cards aside. Shuffle. Put the right locations on the table.  Pick 5 resources. Draw your hand. And you're off to the races. 

However, yes I find the game a little fiddly at first. It's better to use different resources, YouTube, the manuals, Google questions, etc. But this game is consistently ranked as one of the best board games out there. The art is gorgeous, the atmosphere and flavor are spot on. You're transported in another world. It's worth the rules' fiddliness. Once you have learned the game everything is easy and makes sense. 

Another major part that keeps me going is the deckbuilding aspect. The game will play vastly differently based on what investigator and deck you built. There are so many options. It's a great puzzle.

Honestly you can pick the game up for $35 bucks and sell it again for 30 if you don't like it. Means for the price of a latte you get 3 evenings of play (3 scenarios).

You can ask yourself for many more years of you would like it, you won't know for sure before you actually give it a shot."
