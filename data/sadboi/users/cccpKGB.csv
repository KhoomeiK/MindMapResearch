I struggled with alcohol and drugs for years. I've also been blessed to attend meetings, and offer others the support I was given. 

Over the years I've seen many addicts take their lives as addiction takes everything they care about away from them. Depression turns to hopelessness and the pain becomes unbearable.  They lose their families, their homes, their jobs, their spirit, their freedom. Absolutely everything... 

Been there.  No one can tell me I don't understand depression. Some might argue that it's different because it's chemically induced or self inflicted. In my eyes, depression is depression. I don't need to analyze the thousands of different causes. 

When I hear, there's no cure or no hope or no chance of things getting better, I can tell you that's just not true.  Some of the happiest people I know are the ones who've been to hell and made it out alive. 

This isn't a 12 step endorsement. It helped me. I met someone who understood how I felt and he genuinely cared. 

Life is hard, but it can always be worse. If you're employed and have a roof over your head, you got it better than a lot people. 

Humility and gratitude go a long way. Today I had one day free of the hell that I experienced. For that I'm grateful."
