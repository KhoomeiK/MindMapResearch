schizoaffective,fr1o7qx,t3_gm1a85,1589823125.0,"Oh no.. why did you post this & make me realize something about myself I was in denial about üòÇ
I‚Äôm also breaking out pretty bad on my forehead which I assume is from coffee so there‚Äôs 2 reasons to cut back now. Sigh."
schizoaffective,fquh6dh,t1_fqucnnn,1589658906.0,The grounding technique:)
schizoaffective,fquck22,t3_gktlxk,1589656342.0,I saw that! I screenshot it for myself! :)
schizoaffective,fquc7i1,t3_gktlxk,1589656143.0,"Yeah they don‚Äôt scare me at all. It‚Äôs just annoying if I‚Äôm tryna sleep and I just watch ASMR. I doobie smoking weed too lol. Sometimes I think that brings out the chatter thoüòÇ 

And weird that it does (wtf did the font just change?) but ok that made me feel better that you don‚Äôt hear anything and are still diagnosed SZA. Not that the exact label matters but I know what you mean by just wanting a word for it."
schizoaffective,fquats1,t3_gktlxk,1589655372.0,"This is something I‚Äôve been wondering if I do or don‚Äôt forever. I do hear chatter a lot. I will walk into another room at night before bed to go turn the TV off that my mom fell asleep in front of and I‚Äôm always surprised that the TV in fact was already off. And ever since this bad acid trip like 8 years ago when I was convinced the cops/fbi were otw to come get me I still hear sirens sometimes. (I don‚Äôt do drugs/drink anymore) But individual voices talking to me I don‚Äôt hear. My own thoughts are very very loud though. And I have volleying conversations w them on end all day and night. It‚Äôs weird that I feel like I talk to my own thoughts but I‚Äôm aware that they‚Äôre coming from my own head. I don‚Äôt hear them as if someone else is talking to me but I talk to them as if (if not more than) someone else is talking to me. I‚Äôve done that my whole life and I‚Äôm not sure what to call that other than ‚Äútalking to yourself‚Äù but it‚Äôs like other people I‚Äôve made up I guess. And I really do this all day everyday. My mom asks who I‚Äôm talking to sometimes bc I‚Äôm always responding to them kinda under my breath. Embarrassing when I get caught lol.

I read all the comments btw and I have the intrusive thoughts all the time of my family members dead. I‚Äôm so scared of speaking it into existence but I have this specific fear on loop of what‚Äôs going to happen to both my mom & brother. 

And funny my album is called ‚ÄúLithium‚Äù but I don‚Äôt actually take it bc of those side effects. I take lamotrigine (off brand lamictal) and it works well for me. I still have mood episodes sometimes but not nearly as bad as before. It‚Äôs the weird delusion/living in fantasy that I still deal w though. 

Haven‚Äôt talked to a psychiatrist about it yet but I think I will after covid. I‚Äôm more scared to find out I‚Äôm not SZA than anything tbh. I‚Äôm so scared they‚Äôd tell me nothings wrong which would make me feel more crazy. 

Pls get back to me about the loud thoughts/talking to made up ppl thing tho. 

PS I think it‚Äôs silly that the abbreviation is SZA. Fabulous artist."
schizoaffective,fqspjdo,t3_gkhjur,1589614370.0,Is this something you‚Äôre taking along w a mood stabilizer as well or only seroquel?
schizoaffective,fqspam8,t1_fq96skb,1589614142.0,This is comforting to know lol
schizoaffective,fq90du8,t1_fq906vk,1589181166.0,Background noise. Such an easier way of referring to it lol.
schizoaffective,fq8z6x4,t1_fq85kye,1589180043.0,I do enjoy it w my best friends tho haha I get real giggly
schizoaffective,fq7ria7,t3_gh4tks,1589150730.0,I‚Äôm so glad you posted this bc I‚Äôve been wanting to ask the same question. Smoking brings out my hallucinations fs and I always wondered if that happens to other people too.. am I just high and making it up? And I don‚Äôt smoke enough to pay attention to if it‚Äôs sativa or indica affecting me differently. I smoke every night now since quarantine bc I just play video games at night. I don‚Äôt even know what strain it is lol so imma try to find out. I only take a hit when I smoke now. Just a little hit or 2 and I come back to the bowl later if I want a little more. If I smoke a whole bowl alone I  get way too anxious and start crying lol
schizoaffective,fq7r30x,t1_fq79t38,1589150485.0,Omg I only smoke to play cod or to paint lol (or very very close friends). Otherwise I‚Äôm so nervous.
schizoaffective,fq45gou,t3_gge1ep,1589073858.0,10 people in my family have killed themselves. Although none were very close relatives (I‚Äôm not close to any really) I think this is what causes my thoughts of my mom & brother killing themselves on loop. It‚Äôs a constant reminder that I would not be able to go on w/o them. They are all I have. My best friends family is also family to me. I wonder if i would be able to survive if they took me in (like I‚Äôm not a 23 y/o adult lmaoo tf did I mean by that) but Idk. If my fam is out I think I‚Äôm out too.
schizoaffective,fq44fxs,t3_ggasx1,1589073539.0,Oh also last night I discovered Remi Wolf. Specifically the song ‚ÄúPhoto ID‚Äù it made me feel so good that i looped that one song for like an hour while I painted lmaooo
schizoaffective,fq446ca,t3_ggasx1,1589073440.0,I do this so much. I recently discovered SiR‚Äôs album ‚ÄúChasing Summer‚Äù well I knew about it but never got around to listening to it in full. Bro it‚Äôs been like well over a week and I am still just listening to it on loop. I feel like I‚Äôm annoying someone by doing it even though it‚Äôs just me listening lol. I did this w Future Nostalgia too when it dropped.
schizoaffective,fpwddfh,t3_gfgs5r,1588961471.0,Hahahahaha I love how you described this. But yeah I have awful thoughts on loop constantly. And that grey mush was such a perfect example of how I felt the other night when I was down. I felt like something was just slowly sliding out of my brain & down my face. Just like grey & gross. If that makes sense.
schizoaffective,fpqrmb0,t1_fpqr8q4,1588830235.0,"Ok I‚Äôm glad someone said it bc I miss it too lol. And my close friends talk about planning shroom trips sometimes and I‚Äôm then they‚Äôre like.. oh. Bc im in the room lol. Which idk sometimes I think shrooms wouldn‚Äôt effect it too much but then again I also know that‚Äôs just opening a door to me  like.. well that wasn‚Äôt so bad ok maybe a margarita or glass of wine tonight bc that‚Äôs not that bad either.. and so on until I‚Äôm letting it all creep back in until I‚Äôm where I ended up. So imma tough it tf out. 

And thank you. He cheated on the next girl too LOL"
schizoaffective,fpkntxh,t1_fpkn2ad,1588697959.0,Thank you this really helped. Yes I am on mood stabilizers. I take lamotrigine. I will pay more attention now to see if these are happening regardless or only when I‚Äôm having an episode. I am happy i found people to talk to at least who can relate to things I experience. Label or not I feel like I found a community. After this covid stuff blows over if I am feeling really bad I will see a psychiatrist. I have multiple auto immune diseases (which is what they think developed my mental diseases) so I need to stay home as much as possible. Which is also probably the reason I‚Äôm starting to feel this way again lol. I feel fine for the most part when I‚Äôm able to have human interaction on a daily basis üòÇ
schizoaffective,fpkm7nl,t1_fpkg79j,1588697159.0,Thank you so much. I was never diagnosed schizoaffective bc I did not speak to anyone about any of this part. Though I am bipolar. Of course you cannot diagnose me yourself but is what I‚Äôm describing sound like bipolar schizoaffective? I do hear voices and & sirens too. Not as often as I used to though. Only when I‚Äôm very down now it seems.
schizoaffective,fpklihg,t1_fpjjjr8,1588696816.0,Thank you! This made me feel better.
schizoaffective,fpje6or,t1_fpd1rtw,1588665250.0,Omg wait but my ex did this too lol. I wasn‚Äôt against psychedelics at the time. I‚Äôve done like everything tbh but he started wanting to do MDMA like every other fucking day & it was fucking up my brain so bad. It was just triggering horrible cycles and making me feel like a crazy person. And bc of that he decided I am a crazy person & cheated on me for a few months & dumped me. I‚Äôm 11 months sober now so that my mood stabilizers can actually work lol.
schizoaffective,fpefmp4,t3_g8zn0n,1588546622.0,"I came here looking for other people that see scenes wondering if it‚Äôs normal. I mean obviously not normal but if it‚Äôs something that other people who are bipolar schizoaffective experience? I was diagnosed bipolar ll 2 years ago & got on a mood stabilizer (lamotrigine / generic lamictal) and that was kinda that. I don‚Äôt like bothering my family w it bc they think I‚Äôm doing much better.. and I really am compared to how I used to be. But the hallucinations (I guess I would call them) are something I don‚Äôt talk about much w anyone. It‚Äôs not something I see in the room w me but a scene in my head that replays over and over. Usually my family members killing themselves in horrible ways. Unfortunately almost every single one of my dreams are me or someone else brutally murdering someone. Which is weird to say but those don‚Äôt bother me too much anymore bc I know they‚Äôre dreams. What bothers me are the (I guess dreams) that I have when I‚Äôm awake. They make me start crying & I have to go hide bc Idk how to explain to someone that I‚Äôm crying bc I just imagined my walking in on my brother hanging from the ceiling or my mom laying in a puddle of blood w a gun in her hand. I also hear chatter sometimes. As if multiple TVs are turned on at once in the room. This I know is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù though for lack of a better word. And this last part I‚Äôm not sure what to call it either and it‚Äôs the most embarrassing. But I can stay up literally all night long talking to someone who isn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôm not hallucinating tho that someone is in the room. I don‚Äôt literally see them and I‚Äôm aware no one is there. But I can still find comfort in I guess pretending someone is and literally speak out loud to them for hours and hours. When used to live alone I never really felt lonely bc I was kinda hanging out w someone else at all times. And it‚Äôs not like an imagery friend either. I‚Äôm usually imagining someone I know/fantasize about. It‚Äôs almost like I can comfortably date someone w/o even being w them. That‚Äôs really weird to me and I‚Äôve never told anyone that. I just wonder if anyone else goes through this too? Also sorry for just basically commenting a post under yours. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever used Reddit. Literally just made an account to try to find someone else like me. Might try to figure out how to post in a certain forum and just copy and paste this.

PS I just made my username the same as my PSN gamertag if anyone wants to cod w me lol"
