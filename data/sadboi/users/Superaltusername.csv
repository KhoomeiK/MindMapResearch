unpopularopinion,fr36hqh,t1_fr34ja4,1589850923.0,"It is an unwinnable argument. Just by me saying I had presentations in school automatically means its part of my ""experience"" that I drew upon. Having a 5 minute presentation once a semester does not provide any lasting beneficial lessons. What prepared me for it was doing it in a professional environment where I had professional criticism. In other words I grew up. You age you don't care as much about the little things that you stress over when you are in that 13 to 17 range. But when you are that age that is all you care about. So much so that it drowns out whatever lessons are supposed to go with public speaking. Some people are so anxious they freeze up or they perform the presentation but it was all a facade and they barely remember. They likely realize public speaking is not their strong suite and won't go into a job requiring it. Maybe it would be better to not hammer students into one mold and expect them all to succeed that way and allow students individual gifts to come out. Not all students will take your lesson the way you mean it. Some people will flourish by doing public speaking projects, it's better to use it as an option. You could have public speaking projects as an option amongst other project types."

AskReddit,fmtdtos,t3_fx5hn4,1586371045.0,"Honestly, I believe there was some ""funny business"" when it relates to 9/11. At the high chance of ridicule im gonna be honest. 
1. Building 7 was not hit by a plane yet fell in free fall like speeds.
2. Rudy Giuliani in one report stated that the building was to be ""pulled"". Apparently building demolition jargon for the building to be demolished.
3. I do not believe temps from office fires could make the steel buckle like it did.
4. Thermite residue was discovered on the remains of the collapsed steel. No reason I think it would be there.
5. The ""plane"" that hit the pentagon miraculously vaporised itself?
6. The cleanup of the debris was started extremely quickly... No real investigation.
7. Theres a reason the 9/11 commission report is called the ""Omission report"". Certain evidence was not looked into such as the debris mentioned earlier.

There's plenty more weird occurrences such as clear cell calls by those on the plane when it would be difficult to make calls at that speed and height. Your phone would be connecting to tower after tower during the one call. Causing an issue with call quality. ( That is the dumbed down version, mainly because I do not know the exact specifics and I am on mobile.). When you start to look into these hijackers and their passports being found amongst the rubble in fairly decent condition almost as if it was meant to be found. 
There used to be some videos on youtube that went in depth why monetarily it would of been a good option. Also the destruction of building 7 held lots of important paperwork regarding pending court cases.
This is just off the top of my head as I recall.
Youtube over the past 10 years has removed almost every video regarding any of the things I am referring to.  That was done in the name of preventing misinformation. Personally I believe that there is enough weird shit here to come to the conclusion that foul play was likely involved.

Edit: I believe the legitimacy of other theories surrounding the truth of 9/11 were purposely clouded by those saying ""there were no planes it was a rocket!"" I think that kinda stuff is what people hear ""conspiracy theorists"" say and just bundle everything not fed to them as bs."
