I know he was fighting against some horrific racism and bad things but idk, I just can't support fighting murder with more murder... I just feel like your not accomplishing anything with that aside from proving your equally an asshole. I believe in what they were fighting for, but not the means by which they did so. So in short.

There afraid of sharing how bad they really feel. At least from my experience and my friends, we stayed quite because we couldn't bare putting others through what we were dealing with.

Winnipeg,fpl9xd7,t3_ge0wib,1588708949.0,"I see a lot of people commenting about how it doesn't seem fair that seniors get this or don't have to go through that, but I'd also like to remind you that they haven't gotten anything in this time actually. All of the money that the government said was going to be given to seniors to help them in this time was given to charities that not everyone is a part, so unless you sign up directly for these charities which many people don't support them since they're a bunch of money grabs, most seniors haven't gotten anything in terms of help in this pandemic. The people that need to be able to afford grocery deliveries and buying bulk of items and masks are some of the ones that can't afford it at all because they've been given no help. The most vulnerable have been left out in the dust. I stand in a weird middle line where I'm a disabled student in University but I've lived with my 70 year old grandmother for years. So I'm going to learn a lot about  the true differences between age groups  and the fact that there really isn't many. Her and I both are in groups that have been completely skipped over until recently. People tend to forget and Target seniors due to the fact that they're the boomer generation and a lot of the political leaders are of their age group, but I'd like to remind people that seniors of the middle and lower income brackets get screwed over just as much as anyone else. It's only the wealthy people regardless of what generation that actually have it easy. It doesn't matter what age group your in your pretty much financially fucked.

I also just want to point out as well that I'm not defending everyone else getting nothing I'm just saying it's not fair to go down the ""if I can't have it nobody can route"" and rather I'd like to see people arguing for everyone getting something along those lines rather than the ""me not them"" mentality"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fpd2rps,t1_fpcw2w5,1588518613.0,"No that's not what he said. That's you INTERRUPTING what he said as that. What he's actually said is ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" then later after endless rambling said ""Yes, reopen with care & appropriate protection, but donâ€™t put everyone under de facto house arrest"" however he only said this in response to another comment NOT of his own desire. Additionally America had this. At the beginning you were allowed to go out however it was recommended you take precautions, however Americans showed that they're incapable of making those decisions as people continued to go out without taking precautions and ignoring safety. As a result people started dying fast so they had to enforce a lockdown. This was a decision that American citizens made, actions have consequences and America right now is facing what happens when you don't care about those consequences. Had people listened to warnings this wouldn't have been a problem. You're going to be pissed off that people let it get to the point of full shutdown not that the government had to shut it down because people weren't listening. He's also been rambling off extremist rhetoric and his tweets over the last number of days have been so random and inconsistent that investors have basically dropped off a cliff. People are pissed off at him for a reason. You cannot interpret what people say as something better you have to look at what they said and what he said was a chat being used by extremist groups in protest who think that the coronavirus is a lie and that the government is a hoax. That's what he was supporting whether intentional or not. Help now he's encouraging people to design a way to play Minecraft while driving a Tesla. That's not safe. Yes Tesla's are extremely safe vehicles and dry themselves with minimal human interaction however it is still law that you still must pay attention and have a hand on the wheel. He is openly encouraging people not to pay attention when driving which is directly against the law. To say that his priorities are skewed is an understatement. He very clearly doesn't care about people's lives and only cares about prophet. Do you want to know the real reason he's so upset? Because he didn't get his big bonus. An article was released discussing about how because Tesla had been doing so good over the last year it was looking like Elon was going to get a massive bonus check however do to walk down they've been making zero profit and as a result you're likely not going to get that massive bonus check anymore. This information was released shortly after he went on his tangent. He doesn't care about safety he cares about his profit and I recommend the next time you want to defend somebody you do a bit more research on them."

Cringetopia,fnjv54c,t1_fnihp4d,1587007724.0,"The n-word is unfortunately thrown around in a lot of video games. I'm not saying it's good but rather that spend enough time around it and your bound to slip up. He definitely shouldn't be forgiven instantly but he's also outspokenly on several occasions apologized and hasn't done it since. What more could someone really do? They've apologized profusely and changed as a result of the consequences.


As for his political opinions? He doesn't really share many aside from subtitle hinting he thinks trump's an idiot and that he finds politicians are stupid most of the time. Additionally just like any other person in the world he has the right to share his political views even if you don't agree with them. Having a different political Spectrum doesn't inherently make you racist unless you outwardly support a racist politician upon which I can't think of a single situation where he's knowingly supported a blatantly racist politician. His channel tends to get a lot of political problems simply because of the size of it.

Hes made so many videos explaining things that at this point it's an ongoing joke in the fandom whenever he has to do it again simply because people just don't listen. he's explained numerous times that he doesn't support any of the racist actions people have done claiming to be in his name, and has on numerous occasions displayed genuine sympathy for victims and depression over the fact that people associate him with such a negative and horrific thing. He has on numerous occasions released videos discussing about that he doesn't support any of these kinds of beliefs or actions. I think at this point whether he is racist or not, it wouldnt matter. People will always find some evidence from 6 or so years ago to try and prove otherwise.


My opinion on the  matter is I don't think he's racist I just think he's not trained in picking up on the potential effects or his actions. Believe it or not not everyone is super socially adaptable or has the best oversight. I don't think he's racist I just think he's probably very irresponsible but that doesn't make him a horrible human being. Should he do more research into people and things he supports? yes, due to his public and social appearance he should definitely be super cautious. Is he? Well not always. That's definitely a flaw on his part but doesn't inherently make him a horrible person. Should he be more cautious of exactly everything he does and every word he says? Unfortunately yes but again he's only human and again being irresponsible doesn't make you a shity person or some closeted racist, it just makes you irresponsible.


There's also the fact that YouTubers, unlike many celebrities don't usually have managers in charge of monitoring all their actions. Do you have any idea how many pop stars or famous celebrities would likely end up being seen as racist assholes if they didn't have people constantly monitoring everything they say or do. In fact it happens a lot. Constantly they will tweet or send out things that are been taken horribly wrong by the public and later they have to release an apology explaining what they really meant. Most YouTubers on a larger scale have a manager but nowhere near to the same extent as celebrities do. So it only makes logical sense that things are going to slip up every couple of months. Combine that with doing a career over several years and of course people are going to be able to find evidence to take out of context.


Honestly I don't know why I'm continuing this conversation simply because I am one of many people who have had to explain this over and over and over again. Do I think he's some closeted racist? No, and I only think idiots would believe such an accusation. Do I think he's a responsible person however? No, I think he should probably do a better job of monitoring his actions given the potential effects they could have, but that doesn't make me hate him as a person, it just make me more wary of the things he supports.



I also think that the things he support have nothing to do with his content. He could be an absolute a******* I still think he's funny and enjoy his videos. Do you have any idea how many actresses and actors are actual complete assholes in real life. Way too many, and yet don't tell me for a second you still don't watch their films. Why? Well the most common argument is because the film isn't about that one actor, your more interested in the content being presented, the story, the film. The same applies to YouTube, it's not just about the content creator it's about the content itself. If you find it enjoyable you're going to stay and watch it even if you know the person is a horrible human being. There's obviously certain lines people draw but that's different to each person's moral compass. Personally I can stand the idea of supporting an irresponsible person, that doesn't bother me. Some people however may not be okay with that, but I definitely don't think it deserves the amount of flak that he gets.

End point:
Irresponsibly does not equal closeted racist."

Bernie is a very unique example being outside that box, Biden however is such a clear example of people saying they support one thing but voting another. Additionally your Jewish remark depends. Your either jewish race wise or religion wise. They used to be the same thing in the sense that as an ethnic group it didnt exist, but after WWII that kinda changed. So if referring to being jewish as an ethnicity, then as a jew descendant myself, were not really a minority because the rules of being a minority are 1: out of date, and 2: don't really apply because theres no targeted features. But if referring to being jewish as a religious group then yes they are targeted in the same way those who practice many middle eastern religions are. given context however you weren't referring to it as a religious group but as an ethnic group right? In which case being descendant of Jews often doesn't result in racism unless you appear ""stereotypically"" jewish or come from a very strong jewish community. However this is instantly over ridden if you meet other criteria such as being wealthy and white because racism is almost always based on visual representation. Racism is truly only skin deep. If you look a certain way you are targeted, which is where being decendent of Jews becomes unique in that there is no particular traits associated with it unless you specifically follow it as a religion.

To sum it up being descendant of jewish family doesnt give you a minority card unless you actively participate in many of it religious traits. This is an odd quality unique to the jewish community as a result of WWII."

I've always been one to say you should pick a person for there qualities, not race, gender, age, or religion, but... for a group that so openly claims to support diversity, the final candidates were awfully un-diverse.

I mean my country (canada) ended up with a straight white male as leader again too but at least he's a bit younger and our more left parties had diverse leaders. (For context our system has multiple parties that can technically become our PM, not 2, however it is usually between two, our conservative and our liberal parties. That said our democratic party does normally still take a good number of votes.) Biden, Bernie, and Trump are old enough to tell stories of when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Hell all the last candidates were over 70. You talk about wanting new generations in office, but still vote up the older ones or don't vote at all. At least Bernie had a history of supporting diversity, but still... why support some who supports diversity when you can directly support a diverse leader. At least that's my logic on it but I'm not american so maybe there's something I'm not getting."

That's not to say we should prevent the spread as much as possible, but people lives don't stop. Specifically the uninfected.

No one forces you to take the bus, you make that decision knowing the risk involved. This would technically be like closing all grocery stores because it's a place of mass groups.

CoronavirusCanada,fjgd7dg,t3_fcyb02,1583322698.0,"This strain of it no, not at the moment. But there actually is specific strains of coronavirus for cats and dogs. These are known as FCoV and CCoV. Both are non transferable to humans. Both arnt lifethreathening if treated but can take years to fully remove the virus and are most commonly seen in stray or outdoor animals as the virus is transmitted via feces. So if a pet smells or comes in contact with an infected animals poop they can catch it. Like most strains or coronavirus it's highly contagious but not as much as this current one. The largest risk it poses is dehydration amd malnutrition due to the side effects diarrhea and an inflamed gut. That said the feline version (not sure on the canine one) has a 5%-12% chance of turning into a uncurable 100% fatality rate virus called FIP. Both FCoV and CCoV are not common in house cats but do show up very commonly in outdoor and feral colonies. This is why its important to wash your hands after touching a stray animal. (Source: my cat has FCoV.)

Treatment isn't too bad but is time taking. Mostly some probiotics and vet food for gastrointestinal response. Retest every 6 months. Special litter to trap the virus, removing all fabric cat things and cleaning all cat items once a week. It is pricey though so I highly reccomend anyone with a pet get insurance. If your looking for the cheapest reputable brand there's peppermint. There's owned by the same people as petline but have cheaper plans with the lowest feline one being $10 and lowest canine being $11.

They were planned and put together in a way to gather as much support into one area as possible to show case how many people were unhappy and suffering. These haven't been that. It's like the pride parades. At the beginning before it was a fun annual event they were protests for equal rights. They were planned and thrown together in the most effective location. They collaborated with others, notified people, and most importantly, made sure the city was aware that this was happening. In our country we have the right to protest. If you want to block off downtown for your cause you can, but the fact that the city has no warning on it is why there so destructive. No one has any time to prepare alternative routes or prepare for delays in the system. It causes panic and costs people thousands or even jobs. I don't know if I'm for or against the goal of the protests because all anyone focuses on is how destructive they've been. The protests have done absolutely nothing.

Green won't ever get full in but they do claim a few seats usually in some places. That said I do understand voting strategically. I mentioned it in another reply but I never said the system was good, but until it changes theres not much aside from working within the system to get the best results for you. And while that normally means only 1 or 2 options for people depending on left or right views. I particularly wanted to point out that parties do change where they lean on the scale, or atleast how far on it they do and I think it's good for people to regularly keep track of that across the board, even if you wouldnt normally even consider them. That way if you do need to vote strategically you can do so with the most confidence in the result. For instance I like NDP, but I voted liberal this year because where I recently moved is normally CP, which I don't agree with, that said I still follow the CP through social media. I guess the point I was originally getting at was just that if so many people dislike CP currently but whine at the thought of Lib, consider another party. Which I realise as a supporter of one of those ""other parties"" this cones off as bias, but I say from the standpoint of knowing way to many people who won't even look at the others because X amount of years ago they were bad.

Also bear in to regularly relook at each parties leaders, actions, and goals. They change all the time so a party you might have hated 10 years ago or even 5 years ago, may be completely different now. I know its semi unrelated but I think it's important people try not to pick parties the way we pick brands of clothes. You should look at who reflects your goals those given years, not who you've always picked in the past and be stuck feeling you had to settle for less. The leader reflects the party. If you don't like the leader, you don't like the party. It's ok to change that not just every election, but everyday based on your needs and goals."

unpopularopinion,fi4yy7c,t3_f6b156,1582151302.0,"So to summarize my counter, should kids under 13 be going through medical transitions, not in my opinion, however if at 14 they still want to do it then that choice is between them and their parents to make, not random strangers on the internet who have nothing to do with their situation or know them on a personal level. Transitions are in their very nature a person-to-person sting and each case should be discussed as it. This is not like drinking, or getting a license, because those have stricter rules that affect everyone regardless of their personal situation come up with transitioning is in its entirety about how the person feels, and feelings cannot be cut down to basic shapes and rules. If a child has expressed since an early age the desire to be a different gender and by 14 wishes to go through with that transition, then I believe that to be ample enough evidence that they understand what there doing.


Long version:
I mean depends on age and level of transition. You obviously mentioned that yah, if at a young age they vocalize wanting to be a different gender then support them. Allow then to make external changes such as clothes or activities, not that those are gender specific anyway, but still. However I will say that at 16 or so there are specific changes that are significantly easier to began doing, then to wait, some are even impossible. With hormonal medications, while going through puberty, someone transitioning can obtain permanent changes that would otherwise take lifelong medications, or be not possible at all. Additionally if your child has expressed for the last 5 years a desire to transition, then surely by that point there pretty confident in there decision.

This isn't the same as choices with dangerous consequences. This is about feeling physically out of place in your own skin. ""Kids"" arnt as stupid as you seem to believe. They know when something doesn't feel right like anyone else. To compare this to the consequences of drinking is to say that there can only be negative outcomes and that someone under 18 is unable to expect or predict them, which when discussing transitioning is completely wrong. Were not talking about consequences that last one or two days, were talking about life long changes that these kids have likely already considered. Yes obviously at the age of 10 or 12 those aren't things that can really grasp, but by 14 to 16 years old you have a pretty good understanding that if you wanted to transition to a completely different gender that's a large change that will affect you for your life. I think that if it's a spur-of-the-moment decision you should definitely give it time and if your child has only recently opened up to you about it, then again, doing medical changes should definitely be given some time, but ultimately the age specifically they do it is really dependant on them. 


By the time you're in your teen years you have a general understanding of your body and how it works, that's the point of puberty, it's a learning curve for just that. If puberty hits and you still find that you don't feel comfortable with your gender then I feel it's perfectly valid for parents to support their kids going through transitions on a medical level. That said I do think you should wait for puberty to start for those kind of changes. I don't think that a 12 year old should be taking hormonal pills, but I do think that at 14 or 16 years old you have enough of an understanding about yourself to make that decision. 

Additionally I support that opinion because the fact of the matter is another two years of life experience likely isn't going to change there opinion and the second they turn 18 there going to do it anyway. Better to have the support of family while you're going through this kind of medical change then to have them outright deny you because they don't feel you're responsible enough and cause a rift in your relationship where they feel you weren't accepting of who they are. What many parents seem to often forget is that trust is a two-way path. If you display to your kid that you don't trust their decision-making skills, they will hold that against you and they will not trust you back. So if you would deny your kid the ability to change into a gender that they feel is more, well them, for the reasoning being that you don't believe they're responsible enough, they will take that personally and hold it against you. It is in my opinion that the very definition of bad parenting is a lack of trust. If your kid doesn't trust you, you've done something wrong. You have done something to prove that they shouldn't trust you and the minute that happens you run a very dangerous path not just in terms of your relationship with them but in terms of their life choices because from that point on they won't believe anything you say, even if it's for their own safety.

I've seen it happen all too often where parents let that trust between a child and a parental figure slip away without a care in the world, only to end up seeing the kid go down some really horrible paths because from that point on they felt that they couldn't trust the only people in the world who they should be able to trust the most."
