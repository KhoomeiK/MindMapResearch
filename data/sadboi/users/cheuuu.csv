BPD,f2f3ewh,t3_dd45an,1570209725.0,"Oh absolutely. Every single relationship (except for the one I'm in right now, keep reading for the hope part) has been extremely one sided and I had a really hard time leaving them. I feel like non BPD people just dont get it, the fear of being alone and never finding someone who will love you again, even as youre crying and freaking out and suffering because of your so. I tend to forgive everything and when things are bad, my mind just tells me that they were so beautiful in the beginning and it can be that way again. It can't. Every person I was with, well they were my favorite person and I thought I'd never find anyone better than them. Even though they treated me like shit compared to all the effort and love and forgiveness and understanding I was giving them. I thought that if I just try harder, they'll finally love me right. I only managed to leave those relationships by, well, finding someone else to obsess about who'd be great at first and then turned out to be not so great. But even that made me realize, you know, there ARE so many fish in the sea. You will find love and you will find someone who loves you foe who you are. You won't have to try and make them happy, you won't have to beg for their attention, they'll understand your issues and help you get through them. And when you love someone as strongly as we do, it seems like you can never love anyone like this again. You can. The clarity that comes with losing the feelings for an abusive so is ridiculous, and amazing. I've been through relationships where I hurt so much just by being in them but I really felt like they were the one. I was so scared of letting go and being alone, I was so so fucking scared of seeing my so move on and date someone else, I was so scared of losing people who mistreated me every day. And losing them wasn't easy, it took months and lots of pain and tears. After my last relationship, I promised myself I'd take care of my shit mental health first and not get into any more relationships, no matter how much I wanted to. Well I failed, but holy shit am I happy now. Real love will find you, even if you don't want it. If you want it too bad, chances are it's the disorder clouding your thoughts and making things seem way better than they actually are. But once you find the right person, you won't have to worry about them leaving you and trying too hard and making sure they love you back, because they'll make sure you feel safe and certain about the relationship in the first place. Finding the right person isn't always easy, but you will, and you'll be so grateful that you left the people who didn't deserve you. I know it's scary, I know it hurts, but it's the only way to get better and find something better. You'll be okay, just remember that not everyone is a shitty person, but you have to find them, or at least let them find you."
