This is conjecture on your part - you have no evidence, and claiming someone is potentially wanting to hire someone to rape a child is a really dangerous thing for you to do. You need to stop even thinking she may do this until you have *concrete* proof, because you're assigning someone who is a survivor the title of ""potential abuser"", which is absolutely not okay unless you have *concrete proof* that she has actually talked to someone and discussed price. What you're doing is defamation. Furthermore, what you might have read was her trying to find someone to abuse HER, which is a very common thing which people who have been abused do to themselves - they try to relive the abuse in an attempt to ""Escape"" this time. 

&#x200B;

That being said, you seem to already know what to do here: Unfollow her and let her keep going with her trauma. She needs help, but you can't force people to get help.

TheGoodPlace,fhy4yut,t3_f56xrm,1581968682.0,">“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

>An you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.  
>  
>And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.”

I'm going to chime in here and say that this age gap alone doesn't necessarily make it sexual abuse, ethically speaking. Everyone else has said that there's a developmental gap between 15 and 19, but...that's just assuming that you both developed in the same way as the average person. Without knowledge on both individual's development, we have no idea whether or not this 19 year old had the mentality of a 19 year old or that of a 14 year old. People are also touting the experiencial differences: We don't know what his life is like, or your life is like. We don't know what you or him have gone through in terms of experience. We don't know if there really was some type of developmental high ground or not.

I'm saying that because high school and teen years are a weird fucking age. Had he been 20, I'd be saying ""yes, no doubt, it's CSA"". But this is a difficult situation, and age, in my opinion, is a really small factor here for all of the reasons stated above.

It was still absolutely illegal and statutory rape though, depending on the state. If you feel strange about this, I recommend getting in contact with RAINN if they're available to you: The hotline is open any time and you're able to just make a call and ask questions from professionals (not random looky-loo's on reddit)."

>During the second episode, the first time we see Toby, he's making a joke at Michael's expense, and *everybody* laughed. This is before Michael got any laughs from his coworkers on camera, meaning Toby was able to make the room laugh before Michael was able to, *on camera*. So, to Michael, Toby became a threat to his role as ""funny guy"" of the documentary, so what does he do? Treats Toby like shit and removes any ability to be funny."
