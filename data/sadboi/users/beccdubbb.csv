I'm about 2 years in and can finally go outside without sunglasses lol I find it gets a lot worse when I'm tired so really try to get your rest!! If you're feeling extra overwhelmed, it might be your body telling you to take it easy that day."
seizures,fmt7use,t1_fmqm4va,1586368263.0,"I'm no expert but that sounds like it may be from the seizure...I spent the night in the hospital after mine and I literally don't remember any of it, but my family says I was awake and aware lol so it definitely messes with ur brain when recovering from one"
seizures,fmq6rkc,t1_fmpsvos,1586293918.0,"Pretty great! I haven't had any seizures since I've been on it. I was having trouble sleeping and had appetite problems and I blamed Keppra for a while, but I'm almost positive it's anxiety lol but I've heard it can lead to depression so If u start feeling off mentally, go to ur doc or neurologist and see if there's a different medication u can try!!"
seizures,fmpsjs1,t3_fw85fb,1586286553.0,"Some symptoms you may be experiencing could be from the seizure. I had a grand mal seizure about a year and a half ago and it fucked me up for like a week lol I've been on Keppra ever since, and my body has definitely gotten used to it, still feel extra fatigued (that could be due to my TBI though) and I'm not so dizzy anymore."

SkincareAddiction,fjekzuo,t3_fcpn83,1583273721.0,"Hey all!! So I'm currently dealing with chin/mouth acne. I'm 29 yo and have never been acne prone in my life. I started the arm implant birth control about a year ago, and the problem started about 3 months ago. But I still kinda blame the BC because I think it took a while for my body to get used to it? Like my periods have just become regular a few months ago. Do you think it's hormonal acne? I make sure to wash my mouth area and brush my teeth (in case drool was the problem, I want to make sure my mouth is super clean lol) and it helped but didn't prevent it. I also haven't been using any new products. Any tips to prevent it?

Skin type is normal to dry, sensitive AF
Current routine: gentle cleanser in the AM double cleanse at night, 
Then TO NMF mixed with facial oil (either TO squalane, TO rosehip oil, Accure blue tansy oil, fourth ray beauty detox oil only at night, or Sunday Riley CEO glow vitamin C & Tumeric Oil)
Sometimes TO hyaluronic + B5 under 
Or TO Niacinamide under
1x a week or less I use TO glycolic toning solution only at night after cleansing & before moisturizer.
If I go outside, then after my moisturizer, I use the biore watery essence sunscreen or Neutrogena hydro boost sunscreen.
Location: California, US"

Imo, it is lol You should definitely be wearing sun protection every day, the sun is #1 cause of early signs of aging. 
My fav sunscreens of all time is the Biore Rich Watery Essence. It's doesn't feel greasy AT ALL, it's so great.  It's on yesstyle for about $9"
