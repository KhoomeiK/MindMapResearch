Being cooped up with your thoughts and tumultuous feelings on an amp turned up to the max leads to emotional suffering which renders you incapable of doing all the fun indoor things you wish you had mental capacity to do.

When non-BPD folk/neurotypical folk express their sadness or the emotional turmoil that they feel, a part of me inside (albeit a side I try not to show or feed) wants to scoff, because how can the pain they feel ever compare to the pain we feel? 

But then I think about the example of how when little kids cry when they fall and barely scrape their knee and start crying like all hell broke loose, we think they're being overdramatic cause it's not that bad, but to them it's probably the worst pain they've ever felt so to them it's justified.

 I have\had a crush on an ENTP, even though they are legitimately the opposite of what I need in a partner. They know I like them and made a vague comment about how they like me back, we even did some -stuff-, but then made 0 effort to contact me or show any, and I mean any, sign of affection or an indication that they like me. Even though we are in the same friend group. Kinda stung. And that's a real douche move.

 Not very considerate of ones feelings, emotionally distant, lazy, and can oftentimes appear selfish. This are just observations, not coming from a place of hate. 

All this being said, I really don't like making assumptions of how people are, they (my crush) probably have a lot of issues they haven't been capable of working through healthily and I can see their soft side poke out sometimes. They are also intelligent, inquisitive, witty, and funny. 

But yeah, I decided to cut off my feelings for them because they make no effort and ultimately make me feel bad. Better to just be homies so I dont let their actions and words affect me anymore than anyone else's. 

Hope this somehow helped. <333"
