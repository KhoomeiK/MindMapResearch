And I guess most of the school kids feel that way, it's just you're brave enough to admit it and reflect upon it. If anything, I believe that's admirable. You're smart enough to understand tough shit and ask questions about life, that's a good quality. It means you can learn.

Okay, about the actual chances... While it might sound clichéd, you never know until you try. Even if the chances are small or abysmal, it's still better than nothing and worth talking a shot. Sure, you might fail, but you can learn from your failures too. In fact, life is a cycle of failing and learning. 

Then goes the job and university. I don't feel like I'm in position to give you any advice, it's your life after all, and we also live in different countries with different social systems, but there's one thing I definitely can share and confirm. You don't have to love your job. You just have to find the job that you don't mind doing or learning. I have a very simple job of delivering documents, but I actually don't mind doing it despite it being looked down upon by some overachieving snobbish scumbags. It is not fancy, but it keeps me going.

SuicideWatch,fq00ct5,t1_fpzqgd6,1589026249.0,"My point was exactly that you can't know unless you try. I get that you're scared to fail and it's okay to feel that way. It's also important not to push yourself too hard and not to beat yourself too hard in case of failures. Maybe figuring out the most scary components of failing and figuring out possible counters might work? Oh, now I'm just talking like I'm discussing a strategy game, lol. 

Speaking of thinking and modeling the situations: it's good that you do it and you can use it to your advantage in different situations. Maybe the person you're speaking to will bring up the arguments you've been thinking about for a while, or some scenarios would start turning out as you thought they would. Just keep in mind that there are also millions of random factors a person can't reasonably take into account and the situation can change rapidly. One awkward conversation can be saved by a sudden finding of a mutual interest and a perfect date might be ruined by saying mundane things. Our life is more influenced by RNG than humans would like to admit, because humans as a species like to play god and believe in a false model of fair world.

SuicideWatch,fpxiqbx,t1_fpx9a2e,1588983377.0,"Okay, at first a little disclaimer: the whole text that would follow up is just my personal experience, not validated by any statistics and what worked for me might nor work for other people. It isn't an advise, a motivational speech or a manual, just a perspective from what I did and what I might do. The text turned out to be pretty large for a response, oh well.

I get what you saying, and I'm currently going through a similar thing. What I did for myself was adopting the mentality of ""every little bit helps"". When we donate to a streamer 5$, it is not as big and helpful as 100$, but it still contributes and adds up in the long run. Same here with body and mind resources as I see it, even if people can't/don't want to do as much as I want from them, they still do something, and however little this something is, it still contributes to my life and saves me a few resources which I can now spend elsewhere. It's a bit utilitarian and maybe selfish perspective, but as long as it works it's fine by me. 

The fear of being rejected is a very familiar feeling. Honestly I don't know any other way to deal with it but go ahead and try anyway. I know how utterly terrifying this shit might be, I've been through it myself for so many times, and it still sometimes get me, fucking up my routine. What helped me was taking it gradually really slow, never pushing myself too hard. And while ""I tried, I failed but I learned something"" might sound lame, I know that I'm growing as much from failure as I do from success. It's just more painful because I grow more from it.

As for being exposed - this is actually the point. It's not an easy feeling, but I guess this is just how it goes, because for all our individuality, every human still depends on each other in some way. When people help each other, they are all exposed to each other in some way. The ones who ask for help expose themselves by, well, asking, and the ones who answer expose themselves in a way as well, by taking the responsibility and investing their time and efforts. 

As I see the situation, the way to go for me would be asking myself what drains my resources more: holding up the wall and keeping people at bay or exposing myself and asking for help. I would also compare and take notes which activity takes the most emotional toll and try to look for help specifically in that area, however silly this area might be. I want to add that I wouldn't blame you if in the end you choose to keep up that wall, and nobody is in the position to blame you for this desicion either.

Even if you believe it's not going to work as efficient as you want it to be, might as well give it a shot just to evaluate the amount of benefit you're getting compared to amount of resources you spent. If it doesn't work out, you might just return to your old ways, just with the knowledge that it didn't work out and you tried, and maybe even figure out another strategy."

SuicideWatch,fpwyrkh,t3_gfvnse,1588972438.0,"I do something similar for my wife, and she has the absolute same situation. Maybe not as bad as you, but the concept is the same. She has zero energy to do any home staff after working her shift and dealing with depression the whole day, so I always try to take care of all the groceries, dishes, cooking and similar small staff at home, which does add up. But the truth is I want all of this be done to me too, I want to be taken care of too. Sometimes my wife does it when I ask, and I'm grateful, but most of the time she can't, and I don't blame her, I know she has almost no energy and resources to do it.

As for your current situation, OP, you say you have built a wall around you. Keeping this wall might drain a lot of energy from you. I don't know if it's possible for you, but the whole ""fuck keeping the facade"" route might actually work out. Asking other people for help is okay, and if they tell you the whole ""nobody would do it for you, stop whining, get a hold of yourself"" thing it means they are toxic scumbags and deserve to be dumped."

I believe CBT is BS, the main reason I think so is that it's the same as if normies told you ""just think positive thoughts"". I has also been studying psychology in university and quit it for multiple reasons. It became gradually harder to stay focused on things, I lost my motivation to study anything, but the main reason was the way authors of certain textbooks and society in general treat ""mentally ill"". To them, we're just anomalies ment to be fixed, and they're norm, and people tend to compare ""mentally ill"" to norm in a diminishing way, society is enforcing the norm. And I felt like psychodiagnostic and psychiatry are means to enforce the norm. The social perception of morm felt to me like an Aryan ideal, and those who don't follow are frowned upon."

Honestly, the player in your examnle are not CN, they are CE at this point. And even evil alignment is not an excuse to be a murderhobo, unless the campaign is about it. 

We had a CN halfling rogue who was nothing but adorable and funny, and whose only asshole deeds were taking loot before everyone else and refusing to share the money part, and even then she had a very good reason, growing in poverty on the streets. When I played a CN Tempest Cleric, I made him a reformed pirate, who just had little purpose in life, and spent time drinking and looking for hook-ups. He was a bit of a dick, using thaumaturgy to scare peasants, but that's about it, the douchebaggery ends here. There's a fine line between chaotic and asshole"

Collector was RNG BS fiesta (random unstoppable, ability acc reduction), but it had some counters, and the amount of units you need wasn't that batshit insane, around 1000 is enough

Grandmaster was just a challenging fight you can do with any champ, although some are better, and that's okay.

The point is they are the fucking bosses, who are supposed to be challenging fucking fights. But if every fight starts being a boss fight, and we're not talking ROL boss levels, we're talking above and beyond that, that's a problem. Another problem is that every goddamn fight is punishing you for not even blocking, for fucking parrying, unless you're cap iw or sunspot. 

The amount of units you would need for act 7 is much more than ever. It's not the grinding per se is a problem, it's the constantly goddamn amount of it.
