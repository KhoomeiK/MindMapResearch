lexapro,fq0j8yr,t3_gfzb8h,1589032711.0,"I was on Lexapro for 4-5 months last year. at the start it was working but a few weeks down the line I felt like it wasn't really doing anything for me so I decided to stop. coming off it made me feel super emotional and I would either be irrationally sad or angry. but besides that, I didnt have any other side effects. I feel its also important for me to mention that I didnt have much side effects when starting Lexapro either, besides feeling tired + lack of appetite. so it might be different for you.

now im thinking of getting back on it, since my anxiety/depression has worsened. this time I hope to stay on it. it was difficult to notice in the moment, but in hindsight I think Lexa did help me over the 4-5 months. its not like anything transformative happened, but I realised nothing really bad happened over that time either. and I think I have to be satisfied with that. this time ill go in with different expectations.

hope this helped, feel free to ask if you have any more questions."

depression,fpn79rd,t3_gea6mo,1588752688.0,"this is so true. I cant really blame anyone but myself for being not as interesting. but it always hurts knowing im not anyone's priority, not even my family's"
lonely,fpk1hcl,t3_gdub50,1588686063.0,"I relate. We don’t talk unless we have an upcoming quiz. Everything is just school related. Honestly if we weren’t doing the same course at uni we wouldn’t even be friends. Can u even call such people friends? I don’t know. I just want to have someone that I can hit up without feeling like I’m imposing on them. It’s funny because I feel like a lot of people are in the same boat, yet knowing this I still have no idea how to start a conversation?"

Advice,fpjm5zo,t1_fpjlpfa,1588673696.0,"thank you so much for offering your experience. but at this point im thinking there might not even be a difference, because its hard for me to feel like anyone even cares for me in this family. at most they are just presences, that simply exist."
depression_help,fpjlmhv,t1_fpjl7tq,1588673132.0,"im not sure if I want to keep in contact with my family, our relationship is almost non-existent and it might pain me to keep in touch. but I'll definitely think over what you have said. thank you"
