I guess I'm dying to hear something wholesome and kind from people, which I never got to hear since a long long time. 

My life has taken an ugly turn in the last three years. I survived a relationship that was physically, mentally and sexually abusive. I somehow got out of it. Just then, I found my soulmate, my guide, my best friend who stood by me throughout. He healed me. And I truly knew what soulmate is. I was doing just fine. I had my life together, I thought. But just then my grandma and my soulmate passed away in a gap of few months. I was grieving already when my father was diagnosed with ALS. Before I could fathom all of it, coronavirus hit hard on all of us. And I guess that's going to play a rough game in my career too. 

I'm sorry. This went too long. But I just had to vent. Because life's hard and I got no friends to keep my hopes high.

Thank you!"
widowers,fkxo5qx,t1_fkxfcmx,1584632158.0,"I totally totally relate to your situation. Nothing is real anymore. I'm functioning mechanically. More people I tell, more unnecessary comments I invite. People need to stop telling ""get over"" or ""it'll be okay"" or ""they're gone, stop thinking"". This makes me crazier. Like this makes me close up so bad that o don't even want to share things at all."
widowers,fkxc2d3,t1_fkxbfxo,1584624683.0,Hey stranger. I'm on the same boat as you're in. I'm going through the exact same thing. It's going to be a month tomorrow. I don't know what else to write here because everything seems so meaningless. If you're up for a talk I'm here.
IndiaNonPolitical,fko53ce,t1_fko4skl,1584380273.0,"First month of the year, I got terribly sick. I recovered around beginning of Feb. I lost my best friend to death thereafter. As I was coping up, my dad was diagnosed with ALS. That's on the personal level. It's just getting worse as the year's proceeding."
IndiaNonPolitical,fko3nr6,t3_fjm8hp,1584379484.0,As shitty as it could get. Hope most of you all have much better time this year than mine.

MediumReadings,fkf0j96,t3_fi484u,1584124555.0,Pretty much dealing with the same thing. Sending you a virtual hug
offmychest,fk798y8,t1_fk790od,1583931188.0,I'm sorry if you're being through any such pain. It really sucks to be there. I'm here for you if you want to talk. Take care!
AskMen,fk6lp0m,t1_fk67426,1583906208.0,Happy cake day!
TrueAskReddit,fk00q8s,t3_ffo9op,1583736524.0,"Being there for them. By that, it doesn't mean superficial presence. I'm currently grieving for my best friend. Most people I know text me once in three days ""hey how are you"". I don't really know as to what I'd reply. So I come up with ""I'm ok"". Not that I'm really okay. But I don't have anything else to reply to such superficial messages. It's clear that they don't really want to know how I'm or give me support. Neither it matters to me. What blows off my mind is the messages. No I don't want ""how are you"" ""move on"" ""stay strong"" texts. Worse is when I tell people, there's this strange silence in the room. All they come up with is ""oh accidents are so common these days"". Holy cow, I tell you I lost my dearest in an accident and that's what you could come up with? And no calls or texts thereafter?

I'm least interested in knowing what you're dealing with or your shit ton problems in life. I'm selfish when I'm grieving. I want to talk about my issues, my best friend, his death, his loving personality, our bond. No I won't shut up because he's gone. Shutting up doesn't reduce the pain. Holding on to it does worse. 

I want patient ears, comforting words. Sadly, I don't have any. But you are doing a really good job by helping people out there. Kudos to you!"
Paranormal,fjzyv3i,t3_ffo481,1583734347.0,"Yeah. I feel you. I have had dreams from my dead great grand mum and my grandmother. I dreamt about them sitting, talking to me. Never got frightened. Was very warm and comforting. And it felt like they are visiting me. I don't know if it's a coincidence but today is  my grandmother's death anniversary and last night I dreamt about her. It was nothing scary or frightening. I had a good talk with her. I remember us hugging and sharing casual exchanges. I don't exactly remember the conversation that we had but I am sure it was good because I felt quite relieved and happy when I woke up in the morning.

Now I don't know if dreams about dead relatives are for real. Does it mean they visit us or it's a reflection of our subconscious thoughts. I've always believed otherwise because it kind of feels good to know that they are present here with me, if not physically. But no one knows the truth do they?"
