I should add: I too have been diagnosed, in order, with: adjustment disorder 2003, ""depression"" 2004, ""anxiety"" 2009, ""stressed in my work and relationships, possibly depressed"" in 2010. Major depressive episode in 2011 tho I was being stalked by my ex who'd broken my heart before stalking me so like I'm supposed to just bounce back in a day, no? Which led me to a tpist who I still have now, who wrote me up as Borderline due to PTSD which was too set in too early (cptsd/childhood trauma hadn't been a diagnosis even created yet, tho I remember him telling me he did expect ptsd to wind up breaking out into a spectrum and so at least he was informed!), and bipolar not otherwise specified.  Then in 2016 I had two major car ax mri showing spine damages, and also had two traumatizing events re: sexual assault so wound up in hospital PHP where they added ADHD, maybe adult ASD...and oh btw apparently something with an enlarged heart something plus got a concussion but had a house foreclosing and the docs couldn't definitively tell me what to do for my possible concussio... 

By that time I had a pain doc, a psych and a GP all NOT talking to one another about Rxing, and as I had no caretaker and whatever physical/financial was going on w me was getting worse and the pills upon pills upon pills made me anxious I'd be found dead of side effect interactions, I just stopped taking everything.  Kept up w my tpist and used the DBT I'd learned, but....beyond that??  Every new gp I see in an effort to get medically better just sees my recent Rx history (which in last two years is just two small doses of short term klonopin!) think I MUST be drug seeking and or it's ""all in my head"" because mentally I'm on point w my tpist and do use his judgement for i.e. when I have a rough time and need to resume the psych meds, but now I so damn anxious (and yes I admit fucking desperate, too, by now) for someone medical to figure out my medical complaints: severe lack of energy, sleep like I'm depressed even tho I'm NOT depressed, no hobbies and totally isolated because the pain from the car ax and being on ssdi prevents me from doing much, not to mention I dont actually sleep, I just sorta close my eyes and dream all night, so feel dizzy and like my blood is doing weird things in my body daily.  :/  the fact my symptoms are so general and my bloodwork keeps coming back good, they each just keep telling me it's my anxiety and yet refuse to Rx anything stronger than klonopin, because I refuse to also add antidepressants.....which....when I HAVE taken them....they MAKE me suicidal.

While I totally have been the OP and sometimes still can be for a split second til *I* control my condition instead of letting it drive, I have to comment specifically to the above because is my belief that while yeah us being us and how the world dont see or cant relate to us has suuuuucked, I ALSO am pretty damn sure at my core that hey, even if its ""being taumatized"" and ""handling trauma that's so generalized it's hard to pinpoint what's traumatizing humans and what's not""...there have got to be front runners and We. Are. It!

?? What's to say how things 'should' go? And if that's a fact, are they the same absolutes for everyone, or is everybody's 'should' different one??

?? @upside down and inside out... Who is to say that how the masses view and live in this world today are doing it ""the right"" way?  ?? What if us little minions here for maybe 80 some years now if we lucky are only a minute little thread in the tapestry that is the universe and human existence, and so we FEEL like we are x or y or z (i.e.  the normals feeling as if they're living right side up and us feeling like shit is upside down) but really, and again, those of us feeling like we are the Alice in some fucked up wonderland ARE the ones who, knowing it or not, ARE leading the world at large yet in our small slots of time ""here"" back to the **actual** right side up. By suffering and being the front runners?

I know I know, wtf is this girl on?  And wtf do I care about future generations when I'll be long dead by then?  And all I care about is to be normal, or have the world finally see I am NOT and so then to be kinder. Etc etc etc.

But unfortunately?  We cant adapt to change we die.  Just like these normals, all freaking out to their new normal which for is just another day by and large.  They may die not of covid but sheer insanity. Or maybe CDC is right; sooooo many of them/us are gonna have mental health issues that we all know plain as day were already really there just hidden, and hmmm how their struggle to cope or even survive the aftermath may go?  

I think so long as we can move thru our anger stages, get curious about how odd its gonna be when now THEY come looking to US who can laugh and smile regardless of whether we or them suffered longer or worse....we the ""already damaged, living in a world of upside down"" may not only help future generations beyond our own meat suit expirations, but be pleasantly shocked in good ways that hey! Not the entire world of normals went right back to being the unaware ""dicks"" that they have seemed to be; some will come out with more empathy. Others will be forced to learn coping skills and move thru anger of their very own as THEY are now the ones who feel they are losing or upside down or backwards compared to their old norm. Either way. Change is a coming, and it's best if we, damaged and undamaged/unaware alike, get in board to ride the wave.  Treading against change, ime, just makes one more tired and, like a covid lung without a respirator, eventually the death isn't the illness but simply the body tiring out.

I won't lie, I've already come to terms with the truth that when she dies (assuming I outlive her), I'll feel sadness AND relief, but I'll be damned if she dies cause she pulls the fucked up mom card and goes outside to catch covid.

I somehow wind up on the outside of my vehicle in middle of the stoplight, screaming ""wtf your problem asshole?"" and some macho ass big truck driving NRA ex marine getting scared.

Frustrating for damn sure.

That said, if we cannot seem to help leaving our body for us to just fuck some shit up?

But yet to each their own so how you cope is how you cope and...it occurs to me maybe one reason I dont self harm is cause apart from bad reckless behavior when I get that urge, I also started using consensual BDSM as a coping skill for rape pretty early on in life.

Maybe you think its sick, or maybe you dont know what bdsm is but...if the latter? I suggest you CAREFULLY AND SAFELY find yourself a sadist to meter out ""good pain"" simply as a....regular coping skill?  Assuming you're a legally consenting adult of course! ‚ô°"

Just say what's in your mind. Like. I'll be at the store and if I wanna talk about whatever I'll mention my observation, usually about a 3rd party to me and the stranger, and then we talk about whatever with them, and often times whatever offhand comment I've made that is sorts broaching a deep subject? The OTHER person will open up. At the least. Not one person has ever been ugly like ""wtf is your opinion bitch"" or anything like that, which is what I used to fear. No calling me weird or anything; it's like the think-theyre-normals of the world are starved for deep convo and so if we give them even an inch of opening they chomp down and walk away feeling like we gsve them something. Sometimes I've even made new friendships from shit like that.

I also can relate to no support system; I have my mother for like physical help and sharing bill type support as she who damaged me most is now living in my own home, aaaaaaand then the only person IN THE WORLD who I would i.e. allow to blindfold me and lead me around (because trust. Lol I trust NO one), and that's about it.  If Corona has been happening to the world three weeks now, I legit JUST today had an individual even ask me ""Hey how you doing with all this."" 

In the end, I am chronically fatigued a lot. But I have found that breaking and discarding my ""give a shit meter"" as to what people may think of me, plus striving to better manage my time, plus semi healthier eating and going to relax at the hot tub or pool at the gym (pitifully I've joined 3 for about a year each now but have yet to make it to the actual weights!) seems, in the long run, give me a steady increase in energy, perhaps because I keep feeling more and more authentic and able to at least try to meet my needs.  I DREAM of the day I have a lifepartner or some kids who can help shoulder my load even more but until then?  Haven't we suffered enough to even make it this far?? Even with having loved ones, we STILL deserve to self care so we CAN be there with the depleted engery baseline we have from having the bpd, which I don't think the loved ones, thankfully, can truly comprehend!

And so as such, we do tons of emotional/feelings kinda ""work"" holding space til the whole planet knows what we know is true (that there ARE extremes. That there is also ""gray"". That discernment of when to live in fixed mind vs fresh mind vs fluid mind is a constant....like the ocean rising and falling with its waves...). But! We the identified, name-on-our-licensed individual identities? Are also created a. from ""past"" experiences and in many cases b. by environments which had to be how they were to ""make us"" be more sensitive than most but yet also keep our more conscious/aware and self-identifiable self depressed or stuck or looking to/dealing in the sad parts of our gift curse, rather than step off and let us each see who and what we really are/are doing for the future of humanity. 

And so, given the current times even precorona, ummmm....HOW CAN WE wish to 100%, every single day, have the joyous and zest-full outlook of being that go getter who just wants to ""eat life""?  Humans in whole ARE at a point where they're tired, emotionally/mentally/phsycially/spiritually.  Humans in whole ARE ""going crazy"" and not in i.e. ""they sought treatment after cutting and realized they have some psych label to which now they enter therapy and pills as a fix for"" no, but CRAZY i.e. many either know they OUGHT work on self but fear change and or dont even realize how fucked up they/their life/behaviors are, and so both categories of people act like assholes and do more harm than good. And within that bunch o people, we have us, who aren't necessarily in one spot to exactly and fully support one another. We have us who find ourselves here, in this limited realm of reddit/psych groups/fb posts of comrades we see fighting the same battle as we and fighting to find the good....yet by the time we find these little splaces and slices of life-where-others-get-us, we are ourselves individually either so tired, so otherwise having extraneous responsibilities (i.e. a family and job, recovery individually, comorbid things we must pay attention to cause we didnt come this far without shooting ourselves in the head only to i.e. let the cancer or diabetes or whatever eat us alive now, etc etc), and or so NOT trusting of strangers even where some strangers in our splaces seem effing AWEEEEEESOME on the surface, and what? We are supposed to like, never ever wish it was all over already?

As amazing and gifted and kind and kind of beautiful for not just ourselves but also those who are uglier/lower vibing than us, we at the same time, are also humans, too.  I.E. we aren't perfect. 

Personally in my experience, my BPD and things surrounding it? In my tenacity to change and ""cire and get better"" from it all, the label still fits a lot. I can still easily crumble and emotionally bleed a lot.  I can still find myself needing to remind myself to shut my negative programming off because there I go *A.GAIN!* with the lamenting and looking back and woe is me-ing, yes sure, you bet! But also changed in me thru all my suffering? I used to say ""How can there be a God/anything bigger that really gives a shit, if I was to be raped at knifepoint at mere 14? And the raped mich more, shamed hy my own mother for it, deserted by a bff not to mention countless guys whom with my only crime was putting on them an overwhelming desire to JUST LOVE ME?! How can there be anything to even try to ""plug into"" and get risen up by when, years later thinking I'm normal and gonna finally have the life I always dreamed, life in every way I know is ripped out from under me and THAT time period starting with man I thought loved me, stalking me to the point of terrorizing me, AND my H.O.M.I.C.I.D.E! detective NOT even investigating before he told me I needed to stop being jealous of how fast my ex has moved on? How can there be Anything Bigger when I just bought a place to plant roots and then its 38 months in foreclosure and, given my lack of any family or friends, a new terrorization of my mind that I came this far survived so much to what, wind up homeless and depressed and now will for sure be shooting myself in the head asap?""  But then realizing that, in all that, where in any ONE of those scenarios most don't even get the privilege to survive let alone alllll of them in one individuals lifetime, that I AM built strong and that, knowing myself and my history, there HAS GOT TO BE something bigger than us, whether or not It/He/She ""loves and cares about me"".  And from there I explored a plethora of spiritual/religious possibilities simply with curiosity, and from THAT? First tried to do that ""like all my other human peers"" thing and ""pick"" which religion was right for me.  But now?  I just wake up every day and do NOT tend to have the ""Fuck I'm so god damned tired when will it end?!"" until or unless I am having that acute episode where I forgot allllllll my journey has given/taught/showed me, and even then, by either/both the grace of Good Orderly Direction and or my own willpower and desire to MAKE SOMETHING, REGARDLESS OF HUMANS' CURRENT OPINION OR LABELS ON ME/MY LIFE, I stop that negative bullshit thinking and recover pretty quick.  And when I'm NOT in an acute episode?  I sometimes gauge by observation or outright asking others around me (albeit manipulative, but eh at least intentions are good!), that yep, I am THE MOST joyous person I know.  Even as financially I'm bottom of the bottom according to society. Even though I have like sixteen letters after my birth name all of which are mental health DX letters not that of ""Esq."" or other professional designations.  Even as I still have no spouse or friends and hardly any family which can come thru no matter what for me.  

Fuck all that BULLLLLLSHIT, I'm going to LIVE and thrive and smile and say what needs to be said and argue that I do believe there is something bigger, even as I tell whom I argue with that its also genuinely fine by me if they believe there is not. I'm gonna take my dogs places I could be trespassed from if owners saw me walking somewhere, and simply because we want to smell all the wildflowers that pop up in so much beauty each year.  I'm going to NOT share how I am feeling or what I'm thinking when and with whom I (don't) want, because as much as this world tries to limit me and box me in and tell me who I am or who I should be...I answer to a much higher authority and so while am no longer afraid of death, neither too am I afraid of the pain and judgement and again BULLLLLLSHIT that this life brings.  I'll be stable in, when and how I want, and I'll allow myself the freedom to escape fear by flying by the seat of my pants in some things and times of life too....but only because, imo by the grace of Allah, I've learned and will keep updating my learning as necessary in that ever important subject of ""how to ride the waves"".

Coronavirus,fllyqns,t1_fllxnq0,1585270622.0,"Yo. Kayla. Wow.  So....excuse me, buuuut it seems you're part of the reason why covid is happening to the world right now huh? I do believe the header here said it's a dump all for ""comments, theories, etc"" and one of the flairs is GOOD NEWS.  Who cannot use a little positivity in the time we're in right now?

All due respect, trying to drop a link for ""hey hope this lifts you up"" is not the same as i.e. warm kitty soft kitty little ball of fur memes.  On the contrary, perhaps the biggest ""news"" that will come as covid is better oriented into the fabric that is worldly life? Will be that the world realizes that to have less cutesy crap and yet more positive not-crap, not-only ""hard and fast 'facts'"" IS needed, severely, in this world.  We have some government in the media hesitating to lockdown cities to stop the spread *due to their concerns of* things like domestic violence and suicide, and where do you think THOSE epidemics come from?  A lack of, or inability to have, or miseducation about how necessary the medicine of positivity and good energy can be.  Have you never seen NEWS stories about the phenomenon of laughter boosting an immune system, or that the less emotionally depressed cancer patients having a better survival rate?  

Maybe try checking something out, discerning what the intent or action actually is, before you jump in and dismiss things as ""cutesy"" as if one is just a delicate little child trying to blindly cheerlead the world on with pics of cats in a basket, thanks.  Not to mention, if you don't like something or don't think that thing is for you, you're welcome to pass it by and keep your negativity to yourself, you know?

Idk why, but I legit have ever self harmed like once, well...directly speaking anyway (usually I would get restless and then stupidly go put myself in danger of another harming me, now I just recognize and then fight the urge)...but the person I did it about didnt notice and so I thought that's the end of that.

That said, your comment and how you deal makes me realize; as long as I'm murdering the assholes of the world in a fantasy, internal land, and it stays JUST inside my head then I guess that's not so bad huh? ü§î 

How to be sure it never branches from thoughts to actions tho, now I wonder if conscious neuroplasticity will help that??"
CPTSD,flglm91,t3_fojbqf,1585145432.0,"So like...first? Thanks for being a guy who's not trying to let his trauma overtake him, who shows it's okay to at least an extent to be ""weak"", and to try and come here to ask for help working thru.

2. I won't lie. I am insanely envious that you've got a partner to help you thru; I have been socially isolated a long time now and so started out pretty calm but in those moments I get triggered I have ....drumroll please.... my mother, who is part of my trauma and neglect, to either helicopter hover/neglect (when I need her she isn't caring. When I dont need her, she's up my ass with offers of help), and or be her own stubborn self and like, wanna go shopping even tho we've agreed and then I marvelled at ""wow, she will stay home if for nothing else than to quell my condition of panic?"" So...needless to say? Your support? I'm living vicariously thru yall!

3. As for panic. Get hold of your body.  Like. The way we talk in here ""I know there's no need to panic like this but my brain won't listen!""??  Well. One thing you can do is look up PHYSICAL skills to calm your nervous system. Imo THAT goes a looooong way, kinda like when I was told pills would help and foind that yeah, if I didn't mind being non functional for a few hours, that xanax sure DOES stop my nerves from going...

My favorite physical tool is TIPP.  The cold water to the back of my neck and edges of my face help A LOT, to like, force my body to shut off the fire alarm inside.  Then, once I am back to reality of what's what, I can either at least make a thought that's conducive to my situation, even if it is ""well I'm gonna walk my dogs yet AGAIN because at least I won't be lying here panicking""....or....I calm down enough to do the progressive muscle relaxation exercises, and by contracting and the stretching the muscles? It's like my body can't help but to yawn. Lol I'm yawning right now just typing about it.  

Also, another big thing I try to do daily as I also find it calms the nerves ahead of the next panic attack?  

:) Have an orgasm. Even if it feels like a chore just to clear the pipes, it works wonders against future anxiety. So like. Before you know you're gonna turn on the tv for that news update...

You can also do what I like to call stretch yoga; I will start stretching where I can physically feel tension or numbness in my body, and then I feel the pressure in my muscles shift, and stretch that part too.  These days much lives in my hips so if I start there sometimes I can be stretching for like an hour because once I start I'm sure i look insane but hey it's just me in my bed or floor and being on lockdown I've got the time; my physical therapist says I've actually realigned my bones and I tell ya, my gait is better, my stress is more noticeable so I can stretch it out faster instead of hold it in, and as I've got nerve damage from a car accident or few too, the days my nerves are burning it's like as I move the fibers along it gets rid of the firing, all without my painkillers. Who knew?

Good luck!"

?? If you up and quit, what's she gonna do? Have you arrested? Not legally likely and even if so. Lol I bet the cops tell her now they are too short staffed; I'm a landlord who's had meth ppl in her house and so called cops in a sheer and clear panic mode, and still have been told 'sorry can't enforce the law rn', not to mention  again, what ACTUALLY does that contract do in a court of law?  Likely not one damn thing.

And even if it does. Okay so whatever happens when you break it, what? You go before a cop or judge and explain that if you held yourself to it it's more detrimental to your health than staying IN said contract?

Also, since you sound new to therapy and I know the world things very very ""all or nothing"" and literal these days...  My current tpist and I did a survival contract when I first started, and he informed me like any good tpist ought - psychologically when one agrees openly to something vs feels they're forced into i.e. not killing themselves, it is harder to break their promise and i.e. kill themselves (which is what I remember mine being for), and so it's actually and usually ONLY, sorry to say, a mental manipulation technique.  Like a firearm, a mental manipulation technique in and of itself is not good nor bad it just is. But its who's hands the item falls into which makes the item dangerous or good.

Food for thought.

Last. An exit session? So what? If they fail at their job of playing around in your already delicate head they can money rape the already vulnerable one last time?  

I'm sorry, anyone who has that low of self esteem to allow themselves to be held to that exit session or whatever, they might wanna check into an inpatient for the start of their healing journey.

CPTSD,fl1gwh3,t1_fl16cle,1584728760.0,"Yeah like okay I second that hopefully now that you've learned and grown, you'll be candid with them in what you now know; my dad is the same old shitball he always was but my mom has grown.

That said can I ask you??  
As my mom didn't come from a healthy place, divorce made her min wage single mom, yadda yadda, she is now living in my home vs my sister who she's a lot more like. And so I'm wondering, if you can imagine being a ""mom who fucked up, by mistake, then realized it and said sorry"" (or however you wanna phrase it), AND living with a kid who has their issues thanks to their childhood...how do you interpret the interpersonal relationship now? Like, let's say there was a way you used to be but now are not, yet witness your kid struggling when triggered - do you repeatedly punish yourself each time you see the fucked upness you know you had a hand in causing in your kid?  How do you cope with those feelings in the moment?

I ask you this because LIS, my mom lives in my house now, only before she came and after her stuff when we were younger damaged me, there was a whole sllllllew of other pretty violent and deeply impacting traumas I sustained thanks to a bad foundational start to life and I wound up being not just diagnosed with but adjudicated disabled from a personality disorder as well as ""chronic and severe cptsd"", and so needless to say, I have a fuuuuck ton of triggers, most of which have nothing to do with her or our old shit (which, except when she's triggering me on top of my other triggers in a stress attack, I DO feel/know/acknowledge that both she and I and thus our relationship has come a LONG way - long enuf for me to hold on tight when the old critic tells me to just throw her out because when she DOES inadvertantly trigger me these days, I tell it to stfu because hey where else she going to go and how can I sleep at night if I make my own mother homeless simply for being her now mostly fixed/good to me self??)...   I find myself feeling like a broken record because not only is she old and new mom to daughter, but bill paying roommate yet still its MY home not hers, not to mention friend and support person and thus far in spite of trying to find more, pretty much the only real and constant support I have in other humans besides my therapist, who isn't always available of course.  I feel like if I DON'T preface ""okay you're asking what's going in w me how can you help well what's going on tied to damage of my past you caused so no even if anyone can help I dont want yours, please understand"" then she will be hurt/we will be damaged. But yet SAYING it because she still likes to somewhat hover (where I needed her and she wasnt available before, it's like now that my license plate has the wheelchair on it and my income comes from the govt instead of working which already disgusts me enough, she all the sudden is like SO ready to stand at attention of my needs, wtf?), it just...rereminds us both that the past wasn't perfect and, at least for me, there is damage sustained that was the ""gateway"" to allllll this other damage which, according to my ssdi papers, I will likely ""need psychotherapy the rest of my life"" for.  

It hurts me to know I could be constantly hurting her and my relationship. 
It enrages me, that we are financially and emotionally in whatever stuck situation we are in (I have said repeatedly I wish I could afford to live alone/trust others to live with and she find somewhere nearby but not right under my roof, but life hasn't opened up any of those possibilities yet/still, UGH!!).
And it drains me, takes time and energy away from my trying to heal and gain progress in other areas of my life, when so much of the mental energy goes to trying not to be triggered and or reassuring her that even if the triggers I have now are from her in our past that I'm NOT angry or blaming or shaming, just...simply that she had to witness what happens to me because sometimes there's no coping except to wait out the ride of whatever wave is crashing, if that makes sense??


Okay, thanks for letting me get that out and I really hope you or any other mothers like you will chime in, save our lives here a little - thankfully w Corona she is still working but lol allllll this isolation that dont really phase me otherwise IS making things a bit more stir crazy at the house because of the proximity to one another being even more than the last two years have given us..."

It won't solve your issues re money and potential evictions but in my experience things like the panic response in my body?  It HELPS to do the cold water thing or ice pack to back of my neck thing, and I swear...once I can dominate my body and physical stress response? Its THAT MUCH EASIER to i.e. rationalize ""well, if I'm worried about being homeless due to no rent money due to Corona, I am NOT nearly the only one stressing nor the only one possibly losing my place so...I need to watch the news or call 211 or something, so as to prepare for the worst and thus do my best self care. In which I might just learn oh, potus may do a stimulus check for me, in which case I can pay things? Awesome. Stress levels down.""

It's hard to think clearly when the fire alarm rings the bells constantly. Give yourself credit and also remember its cliche as fuck but any stresses you're suffering from Corona stuff?

CPTSD,fkwoiz5,t3_ewn19q,1584599367.0,"Hey hey, I'm a little late to the party but glad to have found this.  I am THE SAME WAY i.e. ""authority says x so x now"" and ""direction from authority, okay now have to make the goal at hand to perform well""....  its fucking exhausting. 

Me, I'm also with you in the ""but I'm NOT a strong independent woman"" tho in my case I am thank God also at a point where ""not all the time anyway, and definitely not in some situations whatsoever"" comes on the back end of the original statement.   Why? Because, well, for me anyway and so maybe you too tho maybe you dont know it yet, I AM female. And on the spectrum of ""being female"" I long ago became a female who enjoys *the right authority* leading some things in life for me - i.e. as brave as I am because I've HAD TO BE, at my core I'm a ""submitter"" be that for better or worse....be it for because I saw too many disney movies and thus woulda been this way anyway or be it for because I was literally beat into submission by so many males as well as life so very early in that I became wired to only enjoy sex in a bdsm context that involves pain and depth that scares most people, whatever....its just...how I am.  

And so when it comes to something as big as my healing and hiring someone for my healing especially as I have so very little dollars and life dont care that I'm emotionally stunted, no, my ID says I'm a damn adult so bills are due elsewhere in spite of my need for a big ass pause button and seemingly endless supply of cash to JUST HEAL myself and my shit??  

YOU BET YOUR ASSSSSSSS IVE GOT A FUCK TON OF ANXIETY AND ISSUES, that are just about doing therapy.  I am 9 years in, with my 12th therapist, and if he hadn't been the kind of human to look past either my crazy or my money, sure as shit I would not be writing this cause I'd have been buried long ago.  And yet STILL there are some things he (seemingly or sometimes actually) does which frustrate me. There are STILL topics that we dance carefully around only recently but which I've known for years I need him to simply dive into and dominate.  But as he doesn't take the authority position even as I now can joke that he ought ""dominate the situation"" or which direction our therapy should go because by now I'm both still in need of him but also soooo disgusted with myself that I'm *ahem* 9 years in, in tpist # TWELVE?!??! 

Fuck all that strong independent woman shit, some days it feels like a shitty kind of emotional S&M from him, and other days I just roll my internal eyes and say ""Damn this man don't even know me!""

But in between sessions, and likely its due to the longevity (which the first year or two when we were supposed to be working on shit I was having new and rapid traumas happen weekly so maybe looking back it's only the fact I was in total minute to minute survival mode and lit had NOBODY else to help aka sheer desperation to stay alive week to week, which got me to initially not quit and instead wind up inadvertantly building some trust, idk) now, I am always soooo thankful for the job he does with me.  

More specifically, he usually starts the session off with the same question each time I'm not already coming in freaking out on him with whatever is on my mind:  ""So.  What do you want to process today?""

I definitely feel like, if you think that might work for you, then tell your tpist you wanna have her start the same way - for me it makes me feel as if yes I've got a sense of control over my session AND YET once I say whatever, then it let's my mind and him know, basically, that hey hes the authority here in this hour and I need him, choose him to be, at least on xyz topic that I just told him I want to know more about.  Sometimes its ""Well, I need distress tolerance skills, so get your marker let's draw charts and all that."" Other times its ""hey this week xyz happened and it made me realize I think I was molested way before I knowingly remember being raped and it's freaking me out, do you think we should talk about it?""  And, lmfao, nowadays too it's sometimes ""OMFG MR. TPIST GUES WTF HAPPENED, IDK HOW I HAVENT FUCKING KILLED SOMEONE THIS WEEK BUT WTF SHOULD I DO BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I WANNA FUCKING DIE BEFORE THE PAIN EATS ME ALIVE!""

:) He is excellent thru it all.  So see if yours is willing to start off by tossing the ball into your court and then you toss it back. If she balks at that idea AND doesn't return the serve with an even better idea? Fire her. But if she is willing to do that, or whatever else you might think helps you balance the ""I need this"" against the ""authority figure"" thing, then maybe that particular session y'all write up a little contract of sorts, something tangible YOU can carry with you between sessions (maybe in the notebook you're gonna be writing your need-to-remember-to-address issues in?? Grrrreat idea!), that says like ""Tpist lady will ask what I want to work on. I will tell her each time and I will commit to this relationship building phase of therapy which I know I want and need and will be gooooood for me no matter how uncomfy it feels/how much I might be failing at it at times, for at least 6 months"" and sign and date it.  A lot of therapy is training your neuroplasticity to move and our cases? Building patterns consciously and over a slow period of time like how therapy works? Feels like pouring gasoline on our body which may be made of fire.  But sorry to say, unless you love suffering and or seriously do wanna wind up a suicide or active shooter statistic, therapy is probably a necessary good disguised as evil, thanks TO so much uncontrolled, unnecessary actual evil out in the world.  Let therapy be your controlled safe place where you kick evils ass you badass!"

So by then, when I started trying? This whole ""Is it the anxiety disordered part of me and my nervous system freaking out, or is it my instincts that I should be listening to kicking in??"" is hard to even distinguish between.

But at the same time?  Anyone reading this and feeling alone - do yall believe in God/whatever you wanna call it?  Cause me? I am getting little worries here or there (house that previously almost foreclosed so homelessness fears trying to loom, and my mother who is also my biggest trigger of past and current biggest support omg wtf, she works at walmart as a cashier so doubtful she'll either have her job close OR care to give her masks etc in spite of the clientele she works with wtf). I also JUST met a new guy last fee months and have met him f2f in last few weeks and lmao, check my own post history and help me with my nerves in THAT type of socializing omg....  etc etc etc 

But you know what?  I feel strangely calm, for the most part, and as cheesy as it sounds I DO think its cause I have started following ""a set religion"" where one is supposed to pray 5 times a day, semi and sometimes isolate to get that quiet and, lmfao, from Christian days and the need for privacy I have long ago prayed inside my closet which is quietest room in my house.   And whether its ""God"" or simply the up and down of each prayer time plus the frequency OF the prayer times just working on my nervous system/getting me moving instead of sitting all day in spite of unable to go out much to anywhere and attempt to enjoy myself....I DO feel like ""at least my stress right now is comparable to 'normie stress' AND where usually the normal stress can flip me more than i.e. being raped/stalked/dealing thru a sui/homicidal phase can do because the latter is MY normal my whole life, its WEIRD that my stress regardless of source IS pretty much and for the most part chill. So long as I or my higher self or God or whatever can ""catch"" the thought train of that one thought or thing I hear when I DO check media or stumble accidentally upon it...""

So for yall who pray. You having similar experiences?  Do you think this situation w Corona and how wide spread IS Gid doing Gods thing to like, make people wake up to some various things?  You feeling calm the more you pray??

And for those of you who don't believe in anything bigger (and/or do believe but aren't ""coming closer to God"") in this time where the stress -ptsd type or corona type or other- seems to he getting the best of a lot f people, I invite you to to use the isolation time to google about how evil/shayatan/satan/devilish forces/whatever you wanna call it seems to, in most religions, a. be what gets the best of a human, and b. seems to be only confined to being able to whisper (as compared to ACTUALLY do damage), if for nothing else than even if you don't like, start believing in or moving closer to Good Orderly Direction, that you may have a laugh - my therapist once told me in a period of spiritual growth I was going thru, that I MUST BE having a psychotic break.  Hes a practicing Roman Catholic, good human, great man, etc etc.  

I have since told him; ""Mental illness. The devil. Shaytan whispering. Devilish functions (as according to the religions which are without specific deities). .....??!!? PSYCHOTIC BREAK?!  Oh really? And just where/what do you think 'mental illness' IS????""

Lol. And yes for we do still occasionally speak of God and the like and lmao he tells me now (we've got 9 years together this May, wtf but alhamdulillah as he was once THE only thing which kept my flying high ass grounded in any way to this earth and now one of the biggest reasons WHY I'm actually alive to write...), ""I think you're closer to God than me."" 

LMAO.  Anyone up to start a ""church"" of casting out The Bad Shit be it fear/the devil/mental illness or the feelings which trigger thoughts ABOUT the aforementioned?  ;) I am already ordained, and have always said I'd never open a house of worship, but I would TOTALLY head up a house of ""bad shit get the fuck out of our heads because you do NOT belong here dammit!""

Here or DM, I'm curious because, for me, my anger isn't anger it's a rage, and unfortunately I have soooooooo many triggers and had abuse from soooooooo many people that things like someone interrupting me, if I'm not already ""perfectly"" managing my emotions that day, and trigger me. I'll use skills to politely ask them to wait for me to finish my point please, but then, for example last night my roommate just obliterated that and got sassy rude with me when I wasnt even speaking to her and because if her attitude against me and my indignation at the fact she couldn't even let me finish, it turned into a rage episode where I was feeling like I'd have a seizure from the shakes because my emotions got so high. Thankfully she retreated to her room and I knew well enough EVEN as fast as emotion as surging thru me that if I attempted to finish the original convo and she said one iota of anything more, that I would have wrapped my hands around her neck and choked her out.  

All that said, the intensity of first the rage and then the trying to suppress or properly direct it....I just.....it feels like a JOB because in my right mind I absolutely want to harm NOBODY. But it's like I'm a whole different person when triggered; how did you get yours to stop or scale back?  

I really do feel like I'm living in a minefield and it's dangerous to me or others (so far I haven't snapped but I feel like I get closer and closer every time an episode happens!), and the hell of it is, in my CPTSD journey I used to be suicidal because life wasnt worth living.

CPTSD,fipwwjl,t1_fipq7ik,1582625659.0,"P.s. maybe the ""thing"" you do just hasnt come yet.  I wanted to be and still contemplate and know I'd blow away if I did it: go to law school. But also open a charity house (did that), travel, make YouTube vids for teaching life skills. Etc etc etc.  But now? I see a future need; because mine has been sooooo bad and deep and I am thaaaaaat tenacious for to heal vs give up and shoot myself in the head or let societys bullshit shit get me to appear on the 5 o'clock news for shooting xyz person, I fight. I win, little victories mostly, and then get knocked on my ass a few hundred more times and from about 100 different directions.  Ive built resiliency. Pretty soon the world is gonna need some new line of work to help society deal when the trauma scales tip.  Perhaps now its time for healing so when the time for ""the world needs you to do your 'thing'"" you will be ready.  In the meantime I'm not saying be a bump on s log, but...be gentle with yourself because its good for your health (and thus good for your ""doing anything, if only my ptsd was in check dammit"")....  and someday as long as you hang on thru this?? You WILL be used, useful ""doing something/anything"". Trust!

Until then, thanks for sharing your thoughts here!!!"
CPTSD,fipwn42,t3_f96pxr,1582625263.0,"O.m.g. I soooooo fucking feel you!!! You said this WELL!

But! I do have a caveat!

A. Youve been thru shit.  While its just lipservice from those who don't get just how much shit you've crawled up n out from, this is placating, but from me, who is dying to find others even within ptsd who has a list as long as her damage (not cause its a competition but just to have at least one person who can relate to the sheeeeeer vollllllume of shiiiiiiit I've overcome and so whom wont judge me or even gasp or need an explanation when I meet up and lead off with  ""so...lost it and jumped outta my car at a stoplight....again....today."") IT WILL TAKE A LONG DAMN WHILE MAYBE, to get outta shit and feel un like shit. Thats NORMAL based on what ppl like us been thru!! 

2. Maybe the ""anything"" that youre doing is simply and already ""just existing"" and without them even knowing your ""shit"" you inspire the ""normals"" of the world w your strength?  Lol I think of us as superheros - because we got blessed w the shittiest childhoods and were fucked hard and deep in our primary life timeline, we also can handle sooooo much more than most. Not to mention when push come to shove we also let the extraneous shit roll off cause we are only seeing the perceived trauma and, unlike them who are behind/below us, we then can know whats important and what's not, and help others with even just a kind word as they flail thru.  And the weaklings (mwa ha ha, superhero as much as they'd say we're also villains!), they need someone to look up to. 

3. A more literal look from my view?  Homeless to almost done w a degree? Thats badass!!  Thats ""doing anything""!!

BPD,fipw7ho,t1_fiprvlr,1582624610.0,"I used to worry but have since transcended it, msA!!  I..some time ago passed the point of no return; if I have to go no contact w some of my FAMILY. Who are ideally supposed to be THE people who love. Value. Hear me the most, and try as I might they just don't get that I'm NOT trying to manipulate and or that if they or I see that I did manipulate in a way that caused hurt I will rectify it, then why waste time worrying about what some less than family type person (either in length of time having known them or being not blood related, either way) MIGHT think about me? I say MIGHT cause lol unless you run around telling the new ppl in your life ""I have bpd"" they likely dunno youre suffering from it much less make time to worry that every interaction w you makes them just a pawn. You know?  

Not to mention....2. Everybody manipulates at times, and in those times its sometimes purposely and other times unthinkingly, just like us except we ARE on the lookout for if we start to manipulate purposely so likely do it less than the average, non diagnosed person....and 3. Ummmm....not ALL manipulation is bad/creates bad so....why beat yourself up so hard?

Life is too short to be lived in constant fear mode, anxiety over being lonely or alone vs fitting in enough to make forever friends. Live in the moments where you are laughing and NOT worrying if you're manipulating. And if you DO find, after a thing happens and YOU search YOUR heart, turns out that yeah, you DID manipulate someone, then maybe go say sorry. But even only do that IF you think it thru and the benefits of admitting you manipulated outweigh the consequences of your doing so. Because you probably didn't manipulate them on purpose, so why feel bad??


Good luck . My inbox is always open. :D"
BPD,fipvrrf,t3_f96zgq,1582623955.0,"Heeeeeey!!!!


Lol. So my thought upon finishing was ""well, go no contact w the dad but DON'T kill yourself this episode"" because believe me, cutting mine out? THE BEST thing i did, tho it took me a few tries. 

Meanwhile, I had to keep in mind that a. Some ppl even our tpists and group leaders etc?? They don't care.  The ones who do will set boundaries w your dad, even IF it was true youre a manipulative asshole just looking for attention. Which you're not so...just chill. I know its hard right now but I promise you. You're striving and surviving and one day you'll realize; YOU ARE NOT ALL THAT BAD SHIT. YOU ARE JUST SOMEONE REACTING IN THE PERFECTLY NORMAL WAY, BASED OFF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THRU AND WHAT YOUR BODY PATTERNS ARE BUILT UP INTO NOW, both mentally (i.e. learned helplessness, nevative self talk, no sense of agency unless its ""the crazy"" part of you asserting itself in sheer survival or need to be heard and attempting to get *heard*....) and chemically (heart rate, pupils opened, short breath...) and changing patterns isn't just a quick U turn or even a wrap around the block with a few turns detour.  Its a DRIVE. And you got it.  But the trip, as sad as it is to see it this way honesty is honesty what can I say, is that it cant even start much or well until we cut away the shittiest things holding us back.  And your dad? Ehhhh, for how they relate to you, he sounds like an asshat.  So fuck him. But don't fuck yourself up! IT WILL GET EASIER, I PROMISE.


Pm me any time."
