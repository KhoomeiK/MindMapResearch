One guy (a 29 year old bartender) who admitted himself used his life savings, around $35,000 and change. On his last day the doctors realized they had him on the wrong medications and needed him to stay another seven days as he would've had to detox off the meds they gave him the first five. He asked me what he should do as he had no more money in savings and no insurance. I told him to call a lawyer and a week later I donated half a paycheck to the hospital's charity fund that helps cover expenses that patients can't afford.

I really hope he figured it out. We got along very well during our time there - we had each other's back -  and I was tempted to exchange contact info to meet up after, but making personal friends in a facility like that is not the way to get better for the long term. He is a very good person who was dealt a very bad hand in his life and has a great family and friends."
stopdrinking,fqtpevn,t3_gku8em,1589643504.0,"I did it, too. Five day detox. It was not a fun experience but it did the job. The first two days were the worst, not because I was craving, I wasn't, but it was because of the others who were in the same unit as well as the shock of the environment. There were only a handful of alcohol detoxers and the rest were almost all heroin. I have a pretty severe anxiety disorder so the daily regime really got to me. Here are a few tips:

Before you go, schedule follow up appointments with your primary care doctors for the day after your date of discharge. When you tell them you're going to be hospitalized for detox, they take those types of appointments very seriously.

Ask the staff for a chair in your room. It'll help keep you calm and relax when you're reading, writing, or drawing. It's also more comfortable than doing these things lying or sitting on your bed.

It'll likely be chilly, so bring warm clothes. They keep these places chilly on purpose because it prevents sweating and helps curb the spread of disease.

Bring plenty of socks. If you have socks with the traction strips on the bottoms, bring those.

Bring books and a couple notebooks. They'll provide the pens.

Before you check in, take one of the notebooks and write down the names and numbers of loved ones you'd like to talk to. Also write down the names and numbers of your doctors and therapists as well as your insurance company. List all of these contacts as people who you allow to call you. Most facilities allow free but monitored phone calls from patients.

Be 100% honest with yourself before, during, and after admission.

MOST IMPORTANT! If you feel your needs aren't being addressed or if you doubt the integrity of the facility you're in, you have the right to change facilities, and your insurance will be more than happy to work with you to get your care. The facility may say you're not allowed, but you most certainly are allowed (at least in the US) as are there VOLUNTARILY. This was my big mistake; my anxiety went unchecked the entire time I was in. Afterwards, during my follow up visits, my doctors were absolutely shocked and pissed that they took me off my anxiety meds. It could have killed me.

Keep in mind that if you decide to leave before you're discharged, your insurance will likely reject the claim and you'll be stuck with the bill (US). The facility I started at charges around $6000 a night including costs for blood tests, physical exams, and medication, minimum five nights."

Here's one of my favorite parables that can't ring truer than it does now:

""The news report couldn’t have been more explicit. A storm was imminent. Hardly unexpected, in this part of America, but there was something especially vicious about this particular storm. Even the name, Hurricane Maura, implied a greater impact than usual. Thomas always wondered why the worst hurricanes seemed to always be named after women, but put it down to the natural condition, reinforced by his two unhappy marriages.

He watched the report with his usual brand of skepticism. He’d survived five decades of these kinds of warnings and they’d only ever become more hysterical as the ever-increasing number of news channels competed for attention. In his view a storm was a storm. Some may have hit worse than others, but at this point every time it rained it felt like there was a storm warning, and in his day they used to call it simply “hard rain”. The reporter read from a statement from the government, in as dramatic a performance as he could muster, that people should evacuate their homes and stay with relatives until the storm had passed.

“What a load of horse-shit.” Thomas said out loud to his empty house.

He turned the television off with a roll of the eyes. He walked to the window and looked out over the river that stretched and snaked alongside his house. In his view, the most reliable forecast was his own two eyes and years of experience. It didn’t look too bad so far. Besides, he was a good Christian man, more reliably in church on Sunday mornings than communion wafers. God would look out for him, as he always had. 

– – 

The following morning, the rain had started. The river had risen up almost to the very top of its banks. Thomas looked out from his bedroom window as he sipped his coffee. From the horizon line he watched a coastguard boat approach and slow as it drew level with his house. A man standing on the front of the boat waved and Thomas opened the window to hear him better over the sound of the driving rain.

“Hey you in there” the man began “what are you doing still in there?”

“This is my house” Thomas replied gruffly.

“The river is about to burst, the town is going to flood, you gotta get out while you can.” the man yelled, bemused at Thomas’s obtuse reaction.

“I’ve lived here all my life, this happens all the time.” Thomas shouted back.

“Man, seriously, this isn’t the worst of the weather, there’s more rain coming. Come on out and we can take you some place safer” the man continued.

“No way. I’m not leaving. I’m religious, God loves me, nothing’s going to happen, God will keep me safe.”

The conversation reached it’s natural impasse as a second man on the boat appeared and said something inaudible from the rear of the vessel. The first man looked back at Thomas and tried once more.

“This is nuts, you gotta come with us.”

Thomas closed the window and waved them off. The boat carried on down the river as the man threw his arms out in exasperation. 

– –

The day wore on and the banks of the river did indeed break. The first floor of the house swam with water. Thomas realised this was happening of course, and moved his most valued possessions up to the second floor. But even as the water reached the level of the windows downstairs, he had no fear for his safety. 

The power cut from the house as he began to hear the chugging of helicopter blades above the house, and as he stepped onto the balcony of his room he heard a woman’s voice on a megaphone that cut through the din;

“You down there, get up to the roof and we can drop the cradle and take you to safety.” 

Thomas yelled at the helicopter in reply; “No, I go to church every Sunday, God loves me, God will save me – if I need saving at all.”

The woman repeated her offer, with the added cheek (Thomas thought) of questioning his state of mind in the process.

“Are you crazy? The whole town is evacuated, the flood water is still rising, let us help you!”

Thomas went back inside and took the shotgun from his wardrobe. He took it back to the balcony and fired a shot into the air. The helicopter peeled off, and even though it was not through the megaphone, Thomas felt like he could hear the woman’s cursing as it did so.

– –

That night Thomas put himself to bed, confident in his assessment that the rain was easing up and everything would be fine in the morning. Or at least making strides in that general direction.

He awoke with the water lapping against his bed, and rising more rapidly than before. He was a confident swimmer in his youth but that was now some time ago, and he quickly tired. Finally he could kick and push against the water no longer and he was enveloped by the waves around him.

– –

Suddenly the black in front of his eyes was replaced with light, and a human-looking figure stood before him, next to a set of pearly gates which Thomas could barely discern against the light itself.

“Thomas Byres.” the voice began, and seemed to suddenly stop. “You’re not expected…”

“Is this?”

“Yes.”

“Why are you…”

“I appear in this form to make the transition easier to accept.”

“You said I was…”

“Not expected. Not for several years yet.”

“I’m dead?”

“Indeed.”

“And this is…”

“Heaven, yes, well done.”

“But… I’m not supposed to be here… I mean… I was at home, I’m healthy…”

“Perhaps we should sit.”

“This is outrageous, I want to speak to God.”

The voice laughed “Who do you think I am?”

“You’re God?” Thomas asked, feeling that his mouth was making sounds entirely independently of his brain. “Don’t you have better things to do than to welcome every person individually?”

“The benefits of existing outside of your concept of time…”

“You’re speaking American…”

“Technically, no, we’re not speaking at all – it’s a little hard to grasp at first. You can’t think of yourself as a person here, you don’t have a body, time is meaningless… This is all supposed to come more gradually… You’re merely a spirit now – pure energy.”

“Wait… I’m dead… How did this happen?”

“I’m afraid you drowned. You didn’t feel any pain, it was like someone turning out the lights before falling asleep.”

Thomas stared at the figure for what he felt was a moment, if moments had existed in the state he found himself in.

“God – I thought you loved me. I went to church every Sunday, I treated people well, I was devoted, why didn’t you save me?”

“Thomas – I sent you a news report, a coastguard boat and a Marine helicopter… What are you doing here?”"""

TL,DR: subconscious went bananas due to some symptoms matching those of the virus were caused by a medication I stopped taking.

I've been practicing social distancing and safer at home since our schools closed in the beginning of March. I'm a compulsive hand washer, and my cracked skin is proof. We've been checking our temperatures every day and up to today, no fevers.

However, today was my turn to go get groceries and supplies, and I woke up with a sore throat. I go do my thing and halfway through grocery shopping I feel my lungs burning and my nose won't stop dripping. I had to stop a free times and catch my breath. I got home, put everything away and I was a bit winded again, and that's when the panic hit me.

I start coughing like mad and take my temperature, which was normal. I'm coughing stuff up, though, which isn't a common thing that's associated with this disease from what my doctors all told me. I take a pill to calm down, then I remembered something.

I had been taking an antihistamine for many months and I remembered I forgot several doses this week. I did some research on the NIH and Harvard medicine sites and found that the sudden cessation of certain antihistamines, especially leukotriene inhibitors, have been known to cause withdrawal symptoms such as the ones I've been having. I called the doctor just to be sure, and I just heard back that I am, in fact, going through a form of Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome from not taking this medication. She said if I continue the regimen as I was before that I should be feeling better in a week."

Top comment that I see is what you're looking for in the short term and is what I'm doing with my bonus pay for the foreseeable future:

> In this climate, just save it. Pay your bills as normal. Build up a six month savings first, then pay off debt. 

Worse case scenario for me, I get sick and have to suspend my payments for a while. Most if not all lending and credit companies are doing this, and for free and no additional interest in most cases - yes, they want your money, but they also don't want to go through the expense of a lawsuit, court and lawyer fees, etc. because they'll have to do this with tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people. I think they learned their lesson when the housing bubble popped and the banks were all stuck with abandoned properties. Meanwhile, I have a nice bundle saved up to pay my medical bills, copays, and whatever else healthcare wise while I'm sick.

Best case for me, my savings triples over the next six weeks and I'm able to replace my older high-mileage car with no mechanical issues with a newer, nicer low mileage car with a warranty and also with no payments, and STILL have enough in the bank to last a couple months if I become unemployed.

In your case, you could use the extra in savings to pay down debt (I'd go student loan first, then the car if that's all paid off, then everything else - loans first, credit cards second) if you already had an emergency savings account. Otherwise, when your hazard pay ends and you end up with about 3 months worth of housing and bills, maintain the status quo."

stopdrinking,flz0y8f,t3_frrwm6,1585613171.0,"I'm going to start this letter of encouragement to you by beginning with what may not be obvious to everyone:

You're not alone. I also slipped almost two weeks ago and started binging; went five days straight with a nasty hangover (I'm much better now, BTW). I bet a lot of people slipped over the last month or so, or at least was so tempted they likely had to physically restrain themselves from going to the liquor store. This is fine; we are human, and I'm going to tell you why it's okay.

In recent days, I've come to the realization that we are all experiencing something unprecedented in our lifetimes. We are in a global pandemic that may result in the loss of millions, and it's only in its beginning stages according to the experts. This situation sucks for everyone on this planet right now, and it's not going away anytime soon. The quarantines may be lifted, but this virus is going to be around for a long time. I've done a lot of research using the CDC, WHO, and the US Institute of Health to ease my own fears and anxiety and to make sure I shut out the misinformation.

I'm going to wager you're getting a lot of responses that seem to parrot one another, so I'm going to look at the playbook, weigh the options, keep it real, and add my suggestion at the end in bold:

* The easy way out and quickest way to self-destruction. I think everyone knows what that is which is why we're here in the first place.
* Go to a meeting. Obviously, this option isn't available for everyone, and may not be an option for anyone in the near future. Online meetings might work and it's worth a shot. Just a heads up, you're going to get a lot of the same people telling the same story and it may not offer much comfort
* Read up on alcohol abuse and how to stop it. Not a bad idea, This Naked Mind seems to be a favorite, and is not a bad read. It'll take your mind off current events for a while and help self-improvement and confidence, which is never a bad thing.
* Workout, go outside, take a walk, ride your bike. Depending on your local quarantine/lockdown or, as my government likes to call it, ""Shelter in Place,"" laws you may be able to do these things. Gyms may be closed, and even parks may be closed, but you might be able to go outside for a short walk. But if you're in an area where you are not to leave your house without proper purpose and permission, this option won't work.
* Grab a bite to eat. Pig out on snacks and ice cream. This may be good for the short term, 48-72 hours, but if this quarantine is going to be a lasting quarantine and I'm talking months (I see this happening for a lot of places in the US right now looking at the numbers), these may not be the best strategies to adhere to. While a day here and a day there of a 'treat yo'self' kind of day isn't bad, this type of living is not healthy both physically and mentally. Weight gain, depression, lack of motivation, the ""what's the point"" mentality will eventually creep in, and can lead to a worse condition for drinking.
* Read a book. Listen to music. Listen to/watch a podcast. Binge-watch YouTube. Again, not bad ideas. They'll keep the mind occupied, keep it sharp, and focuses the mind. But also, we may be in it for the long haul, so for people like me - I can only read so much, I need more in my life.
* How about this: **think about how long you went sober and how good it felt. No hangover in the morning, no wooziness before the head clears at the end of the day. Not stinking like a distillery or brewery the next day...that was what I liked the most. Reflect on all of that; remind yourself how good it felt, how proud you were and still are about all that. And think about how hard it was to get that way in the first place, all the roadblocks you overcame, and what an achievement it was to go 24, 48 hours or five, ten, 100 days without a hangover or the guilt and shame. You did that; you gave yourself that power. Think about all of that for a good thirty minutes. This is what helped me during my bad time. I'm smiling just writing this. Take all of those happy feelings and write about them in a journal, if you have one, or in a notebook. Text a friend or loved one about it. Nobody, not even a virus, can take that away from you, and don't forget it.**

As for me, I refuse to reset my badge because I am not the person I was before my Day One. I was mentally prepared for a slip; I knew going into this that I wasn't going to be able to hold out forever, at least not in the mid-term (hell, I'm surprised I lasted as long as I did in my first stretch of sobriety, around seven months, maybe?). I had a plan, I anticipated my own humanity and humility, and I'm seeing it through; I spoke to my doctors, adjust the dosages on my anxiety meds (constant stress-induced panic attacks broke my camel's back), tapered off, and reflected on what a great run I had before the slip and how much I'd like to do that again...to be able to go three, six, twelve, thirty days without wanting a drink? Never had I though I could've have done it, even in my younger years. If I did it once, I certainly can do it again.

Stay safe and be well. We're in this together, and we'll be okay.

EDIT: I screwed up and saved too early."

Thanks for your kind words regarding my health.

Throw in the right detox/withdrawal medications and supplements and the digestive system essentially restarts itself as the liver becomes more active.

Many folks who I've spoken to in meetings and forums who had stopped after drinking heavily every day for years have gone through this. Some get the opposite at first, but then things slow way down.

My doctor told me to keep drinking fruit juice, eat the green and leafies, and take stool softeners regularly and within a month everything will be normal. Then taper off the stool softeners.

It took about two weeks for my constipation to go away, and once it did my blood pressure returned to normal."

I'm not taking away from those helping with the current outbreak, just as awesome. I was married to one for a while and I heard all kinds of stories. There'd be times when she'd come home with bruises from someone who flew off the handle. One night, she was beaten bad enough she ended up in the ER with a mild concussion, a gash in her forehead, and a bruised nose. She was off for two weeks.

I was at an inpatient facility for a voluntary five-day detox last summer and I gotta say, you guys put up with so much and get so little credit.

While I was there, I was making sure I always said 'please' and 'thank you' while the others yell out ""YO! WHERE MY NICOTINE GUM AT? COME ON!"" Detoxing sucks, no lie, but I wanted to throw fists at these jerks because I was off my anxiety meds while I was there, and I was going crazy with serious panic attacks at least three times a day and twice at night. At least I didn't get a seizure or hallucination.

Anyway, thank you for doing what you do. I know you're trained to carry on like nothing happened sometimes, but please know that at least one of us truly appreciates what you do."
IAmA,flofsm9,t1_flo7y1p,1585337464.0,"And a legit concern, at that!

Disclaimer: I'm not a virologist. I took quite a few biology courses when I was in school and college, and am fascinated with microbiology. Plus, I have a terrible anxiety disorder, and when something like this pops up, I find it eases my mind to research it and find out why it scares the hell out of me.

I honestly don't know if it specifically targets those receptors or if those receptors are more prone to damage than the other components of the human body. I haven't found anything in my research to confirm either way, and I doubt the experts can provide much more insight on that; it's simply too soon to see exactly what it does during its lifecycle. They've been studying these types of viruses along with Ebola viruses for decades, and while there is much documented on these, there's still a lot more data they need to gather.

I do know that viruses (as with most microbes) don't simply target specific parts or components of the body. It only affects the parts of the body that provide a habitable environment for it to grow and spread, and they have a lifecycle just like every other living thing, and that lifecycle depends on environmental factors. Coronaviruses, in general, affect the respiratory system in humans because that's the most hospitable environment for them to grow and spread. Ebola viruses affect the lungs, digestive, reproductive, and parts of the circulatory systems of certain primates for the same reasons. For example, [there was an outbreak of Ebola in the US in 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston_virus), but it was only dangerously lethal for non-human primates.

It's similar to how humans build their largest cities on top of or near major fresh water and food sources rather than in the middle of a desert or prairies. There's simply not enough water to sustain a large, concentrated population so those environments can only sustain smaller, more scattered human populations. That's why they more or less have less of an environmental impact."
IAmA,flo4bfy,t1_flntx30,1585331361.0,"According to my doctor, not taking them could make things way, way worse. For example, if I were to stop taking my meds, and my blood pressure does remain at an acceptable level (120/80), and I get infected and become hospitalized, blood pressure is now a huge complication for the recovery process. On the other hand, if I stayed on the meds and got infected and hospitalized, it wouldn't be as much of a factor. I guess what I got out of that conversation was that we don't want to add any more complications than there already are."

My mom passed five years ago, and I'm glad she's not around to experience this because if she saw how this was affecting her four children, their spouses, and all her grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and step-grandchildren she would've had a stroke from worry and anxiety, and would have suffered because she may have not been able to be treated due to the overwhelming cases coming into the hospitals in my area. She may still be watching over us and barking at whoever is in charge up there to try and stop this madness because she's stubborn. That's what helps to keep my and my wife's spirit's up; she hardly ever lost an argument in her life (except for the two she had with me (: ).

My dad, however... I text and email him every day to make sure he's still okay and we chat about this. He helped me form my opinion. He's following the lockdown order but has a renewed sense of peace that no matter what happens to him: not be infected and see his great-grandchildren go to school and grow up, or get infected and face almost certain death (he's in his 70's and has serious heart and lung issues). He believes that whatever his outcome will be, it'll be good for him, and it has helped him because he sees two paths: live long enough to see his descendants succeed, or be reunited with the love of his life, married for 52 years in this world."

Brewers,flbhjne,t3_fnn6g7,1585004763.0,"I can think of a bunch, take your pick:

1. 2018 NLCS Game 1 - Woody's dong off Kershaw. The look on Kershaw's face was priceless.
2. 2011 NLDS Game 5 - T-Plush being T-Plush.
3. 2008 regular season, September 28, last game of the year - Braun homers to give them the lead over the Cubs for good and CC is nearly unhittable.
4. August 31, 2008 - The no-hitter that almost was. Brewers were right in the thick of the playoff hunt and CC took the National League by storm. Ned Yost was pissed after the game and went on a huge rant about what could have been considered an error (and should've, by most accounts), which led me to believe that's why the Brewer's fired him mid-September.
5. April 19, 1987 - Easter Sunday. Absolutely gorgeous day, and the Brewers won their 12th straight, breaking the AL record for the best start to a season. They won the next one to tie the all time record. I was deaf for almost a whole week.
6. 2018 regular season, Game 163 - I'm sure we all remember that one. Even though it was an ""away"" game, Wrigley Field would be forever dubbed ""Miller Park South"" after that game. There were arguably more Brewers fans in the stands, and Mr. A, despite having his leg in a cast, showed up to the game and walked with a crowd of Brewers fans on the concourse to the CTA Red Line train.
7. 2 games here: April 19, 1987 - Brewers beat the Rangers, and October 12, 2018 - Brewers beat the Dodgers in Game 1 of the 2018 NLCS. Both were the twelfth game of those winning streaks and got all of us free burgers from George Webb.
8. September 7, 2010 - Trevor Hoffman becomes the first pitcher in history to reach 600 saves. The atmosphere in Miller Park when Hell's Bells started to play was like nothing I've ever experienced. He finished his career with 601 saves out of 677 chances.

The people in my state who own bars and dine-in restaurants. Now that everything (even the golf courses) is closed until Easter, these people, many who are dear friends of mine, are very worried that they won't be able to re-open their doors due to recurring costs on their business, I.E. taxes, insurance, and utility bills. They're bottom line is getting hit hard, and even though the government is offering recovery packages, it will not be anywhere near the revenue stream they would normally get. They do have business insurance, but the insurance companies are being complete a-holes on what they consider to be insurable.

I do, however, believe in being pragmatic and I'm optimistic things will be okay. Because these places are closed and there really is nowhere to go and nothing to do in my town, I'm going to save a ton of money every week and put it away. By my estimate, when April 6 rolls around I will have saved almost one month's salary because there's no need to buy school clothes or supplies for the kids (all schools are closed), we can't go see a movie (closed until further notice), can't go out to nice restaurants (again, closed until further notice), or go out with the crowd (again, closed). We are all stocked up on groceries that will last for ten days minimum, all utility bills have been paid through next month, we have numerous video game consoles and board/card games to keep us occupied, and we have an impressive selection of streaming audio and video selections and subscriptions. There's always a silver lining.

If it weren't for my anxiety, I would never have had the wherewithal or even the slightest idea where to begin.
