SelfHate,fr5hrlo,t3_gka8zx,1589908772.0,I feel the same even after trying to improve my beauty. I simply can't look at my face. It's one of the features I really hate. I won't ever be beautiful like a model and I am starting to think there might not exist someone out there who considers me their type. But I know that having a skin care routine is to help me fade my acne scars. I lose weight so I won't get diabetes that might lead to blindness and amputation that I could prevent. The clothes I choose to wear are the ones that make me comfortable. The hair I do is because I want to try and see if I can learn that new braiding skill. We don't need a reason to be born but can't we find reasons to live our lives?

And when you get older, and understand retrospectively how important youth and time is the things you do, your relationships take on a deeper meaning anyways. We can't stop aging and it's really sad to see that getting old is considered so contemptuously in general. You get to thirty and people make it seem like your life is over but that's probably where you actually start since you have a better idea of what you want. You also actually have the resources to do so too.

This quote is the second most important in me getting over the difficult past ten years of my life. It also came to me at a very difficult time. By all means the good old days is bitterly sweet but it is a disservice to our potential to keep looking back. Everything on hindsight is filtered with the knowledge and experience you have now. Take the lessons and regrets and build new memories that make your life's later chapters more engaging and fulfilling. You found your legs and now it's time to pace yourself so you can enjoy your life too. 

Remember what we all do have is the years in front, however long they are, which we can fill with more than we think. Some people live more and develop faster in one year than others do in ten. During this difficult time and knowing how many thousands of people are no longer with us I have been looking back on my goals to see how I can make well the rest of my time and make better decisions about my health, relationships and ambitions. I have also been wondering what else there is to come in my life. The places, people and memories yet to come. I know I will cherish them more as I know how important they are to me now than the me ten years ago.

For you OP I think you need to be praised for growing as a person and over coming the hurdles in your life. You now armed with that should give yourself the permission to be as awesome as you can be, live your best life and forgive yourself for what you could not do. You did what you could with what you had. Now you have a different set of cards so go play your best game of life and record it in some way. So when you get to forty not only are you smiling but you're also ready to write the next chapter of your life! Good luck or as they say in my favourite dramas lol fighting!"

I try to find the smallest size of the product and if there's a kid's version of the meal I try to buy that.

CasualConversation,fnslldu,t1_fnslf58,1587224122.0,I'm not exactly wonderful and those people have no off switch. But I hope I can treat my friends well.
TalkativePeople,fnsldbu,t1_fnskymc,1587223993.0,I enjoy talking so I don't mind.
CasualConversation,fnsl4cb,t1_fnskwe1,1587223847.0,I intend to. I have become better at recognising people like them and reciprocating. My family have always made me feel like crap and unworthy and weird. But that's a handful of people and there are others who treat me much better.

You can self improve and still not have results right. A few friends of quality has its merits and over time you will figure out who these people are. As for social skills, you can work on them and get better. Besides the more open you are to making friends, the chances of friends increases. Focus on being the best wholesome version of you that you can be OP."
CasualConversation,fnsi3x1,t3_g3ojcq,1587222087.0,A work colleague messaged me to ask me how I was. It was really touching of them.

CDrama,fnq5vth,t3_g26q13,1587158271.0,I felt so bad for him when he had to watch her die. His grief hit harder than her husband's. Her husband was way too stoic.
