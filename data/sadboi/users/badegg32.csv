raisedbyborderlines,fqy4nxm,t1_fqvdx92,1589742523.0,Do you always speak about people with illnesses this way? 😒
BipolarReddit,fjhgazq,t1_fjewwq0,1583347559.0,"Yes. When it’s real intense, I swear I hear a buzzing sound (the mania)

I also really feel the switches into irritability. It’s like there’s a fire inside me."
CPTSD,exm77hs,t3_ctkyg3,1566425738.0,I’ve had chronic pain for over ten years now and I’m just beginning to see that it’s linked to trauma reactions. I also have developed eczema on my hands and it’s also triggered by trauma reactions.
CPTSD,ewljjni,t1_ewjf7y8,1565526831.0,"I feel like for a long time I was like others in the thread, sort of uncomfortable and not sure how to accept compliments or kind gestures. I’m still like that with some people and maybe it depends on my mood too. But I’ve noticed that a lot of the time, since I’ve started the healing process, when someone is being genuinely nice to me, it could be in the smallest way, I will break down crying."
CPTSD,eueqalv,t1_euekuvq,1563750990.0,Omg yes. Always got in trouble for laughing. I never understood it. Isn’t laughter supposed to be contagious?! Lol (I laugh at everything now and maybe it’s just because I can)
ptsd,etwu47e,t3_cdovwk,1563284122.0,"I definitely agree with others about surrounding yourself with the right people. It’s amazing what can happen when you’re not around people who constantly bring you down. I still struggle with guilt around distancing myself from certain people, but I know I’m in a much better place doing so. 

Something that has helped me is trying to identify those automatic negative thoughts and replace it with the opposite, positive thought I would like to have. 

I also make the positive affirmations into little cards or magnets that I can keep with me or see all of the time. I just repeat them to myself so that hopefully when I have an automatic negative thought, that positive phrase is there in my head to replace it with."
CPTSD,etwtaxh,t1_etwd9ja,1563283490.0,That’s a really good way of putting it
bipolar,et0h1ap,t3_c9ni4d,1562379012.0,I love the colors!
CPTSD,eszfdwb,t3_c9gu6b,1562360931.0,"I love to make mac and cheese (usually Annie’s when it’s on sale) and take it up a notch by adding shredded cheese, some sort of meat like bacon, chicken, or ground beef (or a combo!) and diced tomatoes. 

I’ve been making chilaquiles for breakfast lately. Fried tortilla strips simmered in salsa and I top it with cheese, avocado, black beans, and maybe an egg. 

When I have trouble eating, I try to make smoothies. Mango banana has been one of my faves so far. I try include a protein powder or spinach because they definitely keep me full longer that way."
CPTSD,esz4oi8,t1_esyyfxd,1562355114.0,Holy shit thank you for saying that. I have felt incredibly guilty. When I screamed to get out of my room (I felt really threatened by her just coming into my room like that screaming) my mom and sister were like “oh my god!” as if I broke her leg or something. It’s weird how her anger was completely justified but mine was not.
CPTSD,esz44rm,t1_esyqyt6,1562354826.0,"Thank you so much for your response and reading all of this. I really appreciate you telling me I can pm you 😭 I may take you up on that. It’s really helpful to have someone to talk to who understands. I’ve been feeling so guilty talking about this. And I appreciate the book recommendation - I’m definitely going to add it to my list. 

I’m definitely at the point where I am limiting contact as much as I can. I’m done trying to get people to understand and explain myself and all that. I’m sorry that you are struggling, but I’m glad that you are doing what is best for you. 

Thank you for validating what I’m going through. It’s really helpful because I’ve felt so guilty, like I’m causing all this drama."
CPTSD,esyuale,t1_esypcey,1562349730.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and responding. I am so grateful for him, I’ve never had someone stick up for me the way he does. I feel like I have learned a lot about how to love from him. I definitely relate about being soft spoken and I think you’re exactly right. They don’t want the dynamic to change. I appreciate all of your kind words and validating what I’m experiencing. It is so helpful to be able to talk about it with someone who gets it."
CPTSD,esy8jpf,t1_esy2335,1562340394.0,I seriously feel sick thinking about it. Like wtf.
CPTSD,esy7y03,t1_esrlzh3,1562340163.0,I relate to this a lot. I’ve had a lot of trouble working and am going through the disability process. I’m working on no contact too. Working on admitting that I’m living with one of my abusers but I’m trying to get out (hoping that disability comes through) I’m glad we have this outlet.
CPTSD,esy0daw,t3_c99bjg,1562337457.0,Thank you for talking about this because I thought maybe it was just me too. I’ve found it so odd how specific the situations are. There are multiple people that pop into my head all the time. And sometimes I’m not sure why certain people are there. Sometimes it feels inescapable. Or like it’s always going to be this way. But I know it’s possible. And the way you worded it actually really helps me see things the right way - remove your abusers voice from your life one situation at a time.
CPTSD,esxkcfi,t1_esvoxbs,1562331746.0,"“You never had to watch their eyes light up when I was in pain.”

This really hit home. Something I’ve been recognizing recently is the smirk my mom has on her face whenever I tell her about something I’ve experienced like failing at something. It seemed odd enough to me at the time that I remember these smirks but I never made the connection until recently. Or overhearing her gossip to her friends excitedly about my latest struggle. 

I don’t feel like she actually loves me (for a lot of other reasons too)."
