Professors,fqrgyop,t3_gkdnbb,1589584154.0,"This also is true for grad students... I‚Äôm a PhD student and got word from our union this week thst all departments on campus are expected to cut their budgets by 20%. That, coupled with declining undergrad enrollment, means that union reps felt confident enough to tell me that I should prepare for less than a full-time reaching load next semester. I‚Äôll probbsly be making $1,200/month instead of my full-time pay of $2,000. And I have a family of 2, my partner is an adjunct who is out of work, and my rent alone is $1,100. Ive been paralyzed for days out of fear regarding how I‚Äôm going to survive next year."

Sometimes we‚Äôd spend the whole day there just smoking weed or drinking 40s, bonding over how shitty our lives were, or tagging political lyrics from our favorite bands. Punk was in our fucking veins because the anger spoke directly to us, & we wanted to use that energy to change the world."

mentalhealth,fqbokd8,t3_ghrmqw,1589240907.0,"Same. I‚Äôm realizing that the fear of loneliness that was keeping me from cutting toxic people out of my life was totally unfounded. I feel so much better not having to interact with the fake, energy-sucking people that I kept in my circle, or having to put on a physical (i.e. too much time worrying about my appearance) and mental facade just to maintain empty friendships. This quarantine taught me some great lessons about who and what are most important to me. Even after this period ends, we can still take those lessons with us! Sending you supoort üíñ"

My own story is similar to people on here... mother shipped me off to a ‚Äúmental health facility‚Äù for 6 months when I was 16 because she didn‚Äôt want to deal with me (she would have kept me there longer but insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it), when I got back, she was in a relationship with a piece of shit who would beat me and emotionally abuse me. She kicked me out & changed the locks on the house 2 weeks after my 18th birthday. I‚Äôm 28 now, have just realized that I have borderline personality disorder, and have started to see a therapist to deal with the mental health problems she gave me.

UpliftingNews,fpjqr3a,t3_gdhnns,1588678187.0,"I get why people would consider this uplifting, but in an ideal world, this news shouldn‚Äôt need to exist. Rather, this should give us pause to reflect upon why hungry folks should be dependent upon the ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù (or the desire for a PR stunt) of a private corporation in order to have their basic food needs met in the first place.
It should also make us question the rationality and benevolence of a system in which perfectly good food would have otherwise been thrown away if it could not be profited off of, even as hunger and poverty skyrocket. 

A humane economic system would include distribution mechanisms to provide everyone with enough food (and all other aspects of a healthy, fulfilling life), and not only those who can afford to participate in the market or who are lucky enough to benefit from the random desire of a profit-driven corporation to boost its public image."

Just wanted to share that I also share your sentiments. Growing up in the IE taught me a lot, & was one of the most radicalizing experiences in my life.

CovIdiots,fnp2tn8,t3_g2l1v9,1587138244.0,"This is what happens when you
(a) have a government response that inadequately supports people to stay at home during the quarantine, and
(b) have a culture that reveres individualism and derides any government safety net as a ‚Äúhandout‚Äù that incentivizes laziness. 

What these people in their MAGA hats *should* be doing is taking up their fight with the president and Congress to demand adequate financial support in order to respect the expert-sanctioned quarantine. Instead, they are clamouring for the right to sacrifice their lives to the juggernaut of capital in the middle of a pandemic. ‚ÄòMURICA."

LateStageCapitalism,f23ne1g,t3_dbne9k,1569932081.0,"So about 2 years ago I moved to NYC for someone I was in a relationship with, which turned abusive very quickly. He stole thousands of dollars from me, leaving me penniless in a new and very expensive city, and was eventually locked up for abusive behavior, leaving me to pay rent on my own (through maxing out my credit cards) as I figured out my next steps. I was in my last year of full-time grad studies, so I didn‚Äôt have an alternative source of income. I would always avoid paying the metro fee if I could. Sometimes, that $2.75 was all that I could afford to eat for the day. 

Once, I got caught by NYPD, and was written a $100 ticket for fare evasion. I promptly burst into tears when it was handed to me. It felt like no matter how hard I was struggling to not give up during this extremely difficult time, I was still being punished for being too poor."
InlandEmpire,eymn99e,t3_cxpe9h,1567214054.0,"Excellent idea from a  worker‚Äôs point of view and in terms of environmental considerations.
