The only difference between them is the fact that they adapted to be more suitable to different locations, but you can have them in both places so even that isn’t such a big difference.

Once you are infected with a HSV1 or 2 after about 4 months your body builds up antibodies for it to fight the infection so you can’t re-infect yourself in another location, but you still have the virus. HSV2 makes you immune to HSV1. Pretty cool. But unfortunately type 1 doesn’t protect you from type 2."

I’ve had my fair share of therapy and going there can definitely open up a can of worms you’re not ready to talk about. 

But what I’ve learned is that therapy is a healing process for you. You get to decide how fast or slow that process is. The therapist just helps and facilitates the process. 

You get to decide how slowly or fast you want to open that can.
If you want to spend an entire session rambling about work or discussing something other than trauma, you can. 
It’s important to communicate this with your therapist too. Maybe speech therapy  or directly talking about memories isn’t working for you right now and you might benefit from a different more abstract type of approach. (Art therapy, writing, scenario-based discussion)

Either way I truly hope it gets better for you, friend. No matter what you decide. Healing is possible."

1. It’s totally up to you, depending on how you think your parents will react. if you think they'll react negatively you don't have to, or you could wait until you feel better. You could also tell a close friend.  I told my mom. I explained it to her the way the dr. told me, it’s very common etc. It made me feel better and I had someone to care for me when I was sick. (I got really sick my first outbreak: fever, chills and throwing up.)  If you do decide to tell them, you don't need to tell specify where it is, herpes can be anywhere on the body.
2. I really had to accept this as part of myself. Just like with anything else. I had to accept it for what it was: It’s an inconvenience. But so is my social anxiety. It kind of taught me to accept the rest of myself.
3. I felt like that for a long time, really beating myself up over it. I felt guilty for getting it at first. But something that helped me was realizing I wasn't stupid- viruses like these are inevitable, I was just unlucky.
4. It wasn't until I told my best friend that I felt better. I take 500 Valtrex daily. (Half of the starting dose) I still think about it every day, but I've read stories of people on here forgetting they have it. I think it's easier to forget it the less big a deal you make of it.

Depression is an evolutionary trait. I know this may sound ridiculous because of how inconvenient and troublesome it is, but depression is genetic... so it must be a trait someone had at some point in history that was passed down through history.

There are many theories as to why that is:

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/depressions-evolutionary/

Animals can also suffer from depression. It’s just the way the brain works. Humans constantly bring under stress and societal pressures are also factors that, unfortunately, make it so common.
