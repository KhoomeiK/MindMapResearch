Anxiety,euowk61,t1_euo7ies,1563947959.0,"Scary, but the only googling I'll allow myself is my symptoms plus anxiety. Usually a good reminder that what we're experiencing is mind made."
Anxiety,eufgxws,t1_euea9ld,1563773967.0,"This is important. Went through a rabies scare (lol) but after reading about the symptoms, such as having trouble swallowing, what happened? I began having difficulty swallowing, so much so that I really thought I was a goner. It was all anxiety. Currently worried about ALS after a 24 hour muscle twitch. Then I read that the tingling usually starts in the legs. What have I been feeling all day? Of course, tingling and weakness in my legs. I haven't looked up anymore symptoms because I know where that leads. So important for us to remember all of our last health scares and how we've come out on top each time. Also a good reminder to appreciate the life we've got and the one's we've got  We're also probably more mentally prepared for death than the average person!"
