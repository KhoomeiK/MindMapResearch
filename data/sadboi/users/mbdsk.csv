More details:

July 2017 - Started to get my hair chemically straightened in 2006 and did it religiously every six or so months. After 10+ years of it, this is my hair looked like on the day I went through the straightening procedure for the last time.

March 2018 - I chose to stop with the chemical straightening treatment as it was making my hair lifeless and it was falling too much. This is what it looked like one a very good hair day while I was growing it out for a chop. 

January 2019 - A few months after a haircut, this is what it looked like. I was still using the same products as I did before - regular drugstore shampoo and conditioning, no special routine whatsoever. 

September 2019 - I've been using paraben-free and silicon-free shampoo, conditioning and hidration masks for three months now. I've been experimenting with S2C and SOTC but never got the hang of it properly. This is what my hair looks like right now, after getting my first Devacut last night. The hairdressers were lovely, showed me how to take care of my hair and I'm looking into getting the proper products so I can maintain it at home.

I thought I'd share because I'm super proud of how far I've come and I hope I can inspire people who thinks ""my hair would never do that"", because that's how I felt before I started this journey. Thankfully I was wrong!!!

There is still a long way to go for me and I've got lots to learn! I want my hair to grow long and healthy. Any tips are much appreciated! 

Thanks to everyone in this sub, you've been my main source of inspiration üôåüèª"
