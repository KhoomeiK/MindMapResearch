Drugs,fprgq6g,t3_gf4vgq,1588853687.0,"I don't do drugs, but I can say that you ""should"" try to stop. My addiction is to cut and have relationships that I care too much about and then I become suicidal when I'm left on the road with nobody to love and support me. I'm struggling with depression as you can imagine and it's the ""curse"" I want to end. But my desire to end it comes from my sister always being there for me, and the other members of my family too.

Because I'm the last child (gap of 13 and 10 years with my sisters), I always thought that at my age they were doing great and stuff. But lately, since I've opened myself to them (can't say that we're not close, we are because the horrors we've gone trough made us stick together and grow up together), I learnt that their teenagehood wasn't bright at all even though today they are powerful women who do the job they love.

They went through hell as well. You aren't the black sheep. You think you are because nobody in your family bothered to share with you the darkest parts of their lives, but there are some, and there are more and more in successful and brilliant people's lives. Maybe they look down on you, but all they see in you is what they once were, the version of them they don't like to see. They remember what they've gone through and that's difficult to look.

You remind them of the battle they had to live. We all have these battles. I'd recommand that you go talk to a therapist, maybe take some meds for depression (helps me but again I'm not into drugs so don't know if it's a good advice), and make a whole new family made of friends who will support you because you need this, you need people who embrace who you are.

I add that I'm sorry for the pain your caused yourself, the hatred, the loneliness... I know all of this but I wanna fight, and because you posted this, I know a part of you wants to fight too.

I love you, take care as much as you can."

I know that's how life goes, but, you know... it's the first time I fall in love with someone, and I know why it was her: we were intimate because we were so special in this weird world like, I don't know, we were into reading and writing but most people who read and write are so pretentious and it's THE thing I hate cause we're all capable of anything and people who love literature are always so dumb and think they're the best in the world just because they read this or that. Also, because she is a muslim and I was shy, we were both kind of bashful, and it was so nice when we dared to hold hands or cuddle during class. 

I met some beautiful people in college, and even on a dating app, but after a while, I always find out that we're not one, and we'll never be. 

She and I were so similar, and the people I currently talk to are way different from me and can't get me because I listen to every possible type of music, I'm androgyn, I'm so not capable of having any friend that will get me totally and unconditionnally.

If I were still living with her, I wouldn't want her to meet my girlfriend. And, for my friends, it would take a while bc I'm anxious around people who don't know each other but who I have to connect since I'm the link between them.

Family stuff... anxiety... maybe that's not his case, but I really feel like you're getting along together, and I can't think that he's a jerk who lied to you. 

When did your relationship start? Was it physical or did you meet on the internet?"

depression,fp7d9n9,t3_gbqbvz,1588368461.0,"I don't care about the diplomas, the weight, the size. I don't care about what the society sees as a bright life. I care about what you see as a bright life. 

Distinguish who you want to be from who the others want you to be. I know it's hard, and I know it takes a lot of time and courage, and some h e l p (you certainly can't do it alone).

What is disgusting is that you feel that way because of what you've heard, seen, read about what people told you: that being skinny is prettier, that having some huge muscles is great... honestly, I will never understand all of this crap.

Whatever. You matter. And you have to put you first. You have to desire to be healthy. The energy you put in your studies has to go to yourself: see you as the man you are! Someone who is desperately needy of help, and doing his frigging best to succeed! You failed, okay, then what? I did too, multiple times. Who didn't? And for the weight, your problem is international, which makes it easier for you to find help. 

You can go through this. Please don't let yourself go because you think you are not worth anything (love, especially). Of course you are, it's obvious to me. You can identify the worse point in your life, the one that makes you sick of yourself, and then find a group of people talking about it (you seem to care a lot about this weight problem: focus on it. What is missing in you, that puts you in the situation of addiction to products that will fill the void? What is your void? Where does it come from?)

Your description of yourself shouts that you're capable of anything. As long as you start to see that your first goal has to be you (your mental health). Nothing else."

depression,fp5kq6n,t1_fp5hxmr,1588332795.0,"God I understand, even if I hurt myself and keep it for me so that my relatives and friends don't receive my wrath... but it's horrible. Have you ever tried to call a line that could help you? They must hear everything, they can endure listening to the worse things you have to say. You're not mean or whatever you think you are, you're in deep pain and it makes you act like a beast that doesn't want to communicate and all. When it happens to me, I want to insult every single person that loves me, but the next day, I'm glad I didn't because I know that I wasn't thinking straight. Although I sometimes think that someone who loves me should accept that I want to die, but that's something else. I want you to speak your mind with someone neutral, and I'm not asking, I'm pleasing you: do it."

I gave up online school, I'll get some zeros, I'm okay with it. My days are full of me distracting myself from the dark mess I carry inside of me. If you can't concentrate, it's normal. Let your professors know that you won't be able to follow anymore because of your psychologic situation, and they'll get it. You're not gonna have good grades, yes, but you'll be a bit relieved from what you're living right now. In my case I chose the classes I wanted to attend, because they're my favourites. Feel free to select what you can still focus on. Feel free to be sad, feel free to not be able to keep on going when the world is going through covid-19, and when you're going through depression. Please, listen to your mind; it's screaming that it can't take anything anymore. Let it rest for a while, and don't feel bad. I abandonned too, it's my choice, and I forget about it when I draw or listen to music quietly, (almost) completely relaxed... let it go, for a while at least if you can't bare the fact that you'll give up until the end of the year."
depression,fp2sht5,t3_gazo0c,1588267151.0,"I don't remember who told this to me, but here it is: maybe people don't fit to what you have to say, or maybe what you have to say doesn't fit with people. Seems more like the second option, right? If so, there are, again, different possibilities:

1) you're too afraid to talk
2) you're too hurt to talk
3) you're too ashamed to talk
4) you're not ready to talk

Either way, it comes from the vision that you have. And I just want to stress something: I get what you mean when you speak about the feeling of not being heard the right way. But truth is, people who love you will not be able to see how much you're in pain (happened to me), and by ""people who love you"" I mean your family but also the friends you wish you had. I hope that what I said rings a bell... sometimes we think we lack something because what we do possess doesn't seem right, but in fact, it is right... it's just that we're not ready for it. So, maybe you're not ready to talk...?

 Anyway, if what I say doesn't mean a thing to you,  I recommand is that you keep digging to find the right psychologist who will be available and able to listen to you the right way. Can take a while, but it's worth a new try, I know it."
depression,foxneoy,t1_fow0mve,1588149621.0,"Being single doesn't mean a thing, being insulted only means that people are mean to you, but it doesn't come from you. I am single and I keep wondering why, but deep down I know I'm not completely ready to be with someone. There are plenty of things in you that make you think like that, and what the others make you feel is the mirror of what YOU think you are. Behave like a ""bad boy"" and girls who like this type will think you are one. Behave like you hate yourself... and people will feel it. It's not a dead end, it just means that it has to come from you: change the way you see yourself and people will see you differently too. I add that I also hate myself, think I'm too short, not smart enough, a mess in comparison to the members of my family... and I don't know how you stop hating yourself one day. But I know it's the key. Maybe we need an epiphany, an event. But I know it has to come from us, not from people. From us."

EQ is for you, as a human. How do you manage your emotions? Emotions are everything. Focus on them. Focus on you. If you can... I know how hard it is, I could have asked the same question about suicide. But if it's a matter of intelligence, oh my god, please, forget about this whole bullsh.t! You are so much more than a brain! You're a human, you matter as such. Being part of the human kind is not being smart, it's being capable of empathy, love, being understanding, trusrworthy. Be kind to yourself, you're more than what your school made you believe you were."
