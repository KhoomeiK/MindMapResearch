Also, Nick's behavior has been consistent thru so many years. I've always trusted him that he's gotten help but lo and behold, he does the same shit again but *this time,* is even worse. Like, Evan and Wes has stuck by him thru all shit Nick's caused for the band... And now I see these screenshots of how he treats Wes and Evan and I just can't believe I've given nick so much benefit of the doubt. Like, from the texts and what Evan said, it sounds like nick treats this Mccafferty like a job where he's the boss and is in control of how Wes and Evan get paid. He calls mccafferty a ""business"" and ""team"". Nick sounds like a nightmare to those close to him. But honestly, even fans were fucked over too, like the fan who was invited to stay over nick and Lindsay's place to record. Or the many others who weren't credited for their art work and contribution.

I've given nick the benefit of the doubt for so long, even after the shitty Yarn album, but I can honestly say now... Fuck Nick Hartkop."
