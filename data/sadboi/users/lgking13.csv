MakeupRehab,fr51jea,t1_fr4igm5,1589900838.0,"Unsubbing, unfollowing beauty media is/was huge for me as far as putting a halt to my spending and improving my overall feelings."
bipolar,fr4z0dh,t3_gmdq2u,1589899533.0,So very excited for you!!
bipolar,fqyixga,t3_glkxei,1589749324.0,I felt the same way when I got that “achievement” Hope next week is better for you.
bipolar,fqyiu7k,t3_glmamr,1589749282.0,Yes. That’s typical for me
bipolar,fqy29ua,t3_glgerb,1589741424.0,Good work! 💜💜

Booty call is good too. The other two currently in the series are a little darker and one comes with a trigger warning."

bipolar,fq7acjd,t3_ggzfks,1589143825.0,"Thank you for posting this! Every time someone posts a new way to use daylio, I get excited. I have not nearly been using the app to its potential. I use daylio to track my symptoms and now have a much better way to use if."
RomanceBooks,fq73y6r,t3_ggo7zz,1589141482.0,"Prime Minister by Ainsley Booth. He’s PM of Canada, she’s an intern, but not in a creepy way. It is mild bdsm and there is a semi-ménage scene. Just FYI."
RomanceBooks,fq73ocw,t1_fq3fkrk,1589141381.0,Came here to recommend Rock Hard.
redsox,fq6hlld,t3_gh45x4,1589131679.0,I just told my husband it should be on...ESPN though. I don’t have NESN.
RomanceBooks,fq6fd8o,t1_fq5pxpn,1589130446.0,I’m a spoiler fiend too!
RomanceBooks,fq6ezdb,t3_ggw1ga,1589130232.0,I read a few.  I usually read a couple of four and five star reviews as well as a couple one star. I believe there is truth in both and try to make my decision off of that if I’m trying to decide on a book. I typically only look at reviews for authors I’m not familiar with.
RomanceBooks,fq1gut8,t1_fq0hmi2,1589045533.0,I’ll put it in the tbr pile!
RomanceBooks,fq04wkv,t1_fpx0w53,1589027665.0,I used to do this a lot! I miss doing it.
RomanceBooks,fpxi0z4,t1_fpxcl63,1588983008.0,Her archangel series is why I can’t read fantasy. I haven’t read them recently but they ruined me for fantasy.
bipolar,fpxeuw6,t3_gfz4zj,1588981327.0,Accurate for me. Except five minutes after this I passed out.
RomanceBooks,fpxe7uy,t1_fpxdyyb,1588980958.0,I adore Wrong and I’m not sure why. I think it’s that at some point the Hero acknowledges that the heroine is young and a little immature so I can forgive it. Austen seems to do a good job of writing lovable hero’s but grating heroines.
RomanceBooks,fpxdscu,t1_fpxdkjy,1588980708.0,Right?? Although I do say legiterally with alarming frequency. I think that was her. I read several of Jana Austen’s back to back. I just wanted Payton to shhhhhhh.
RomanceBooks,fpxdm0l,t1_fpxco65,1588980607.0,Banner is awesome and Unapologetic about her sex life.
RomanceBooks,fpxdg68,t1_fpwqxjm,1588980514.0,Good time is a good book - if you can get beyond the irritating h however.
RomanceBooks,fpxdc4k,t3_gfcp2l,1588980450.0,Thanks everyone. My tbr pile has certainly grown!
RomanceBooks,fpxbiqz,t1_fptui0f,1588979410.0,One of my faves!
RomanceBooks,fpsxjok,t1_fpsxfos,1588881306.0,Great!! I’ll look for them now! Thanks 😊
RomanceBooks,fpsu824,t1_fpstyew,1588879699.0,"Thanks! I’ll check those out! 

I’m kind of sensitive to dark and twisty things, do you mind expounding on the trigger warnings?"
RomanceBooks,fpsu2w3,t1_fpstk4o,1588879631.0,Hot shot is one of my favorites that I forgot about! I’ll check out the other two.
bipolar,fpds32l,t3_gcvjr8,1588533095.0,"Yes! I get this way a lot. I’m not depressed, I’m not any variation of manic. I’m just...meh. I actually made it it’s own category in Daylio."
bipolar,fp6dgz8,t3_gbfvjl,1588350455.0,Yes. Seroquel is the devil to me. Also Paxil.
Journaling,fp2ukt1,t3_gasedv,1588268138.0,"I started journaling around 12 but right before I moved in with my husband, I threw them all away. I sincerely wish I  hadn’t as my almost 40 year old self would love/hate to read them now."
RomanceBooks,fovkqk4,t1_fotojmz,1588102969.0,Same
RomanceBooks,fovknns,t3_g9imxc,1588102929.0,"I debated adding a comment. My husband is not very verbally affectionate aside from telling me he loves me. He’s also not overtly alpha. He’s a quiet alpha. I read a lot of “alpha” books and while I think sometimes I’d rather my husband be that way, irl, I’d probably not take it very well. So, yes, the books give me unrealistic expectations, but also I communicate this a lot with my husband and at this point he mostly finds it amusing. 

Maybe that makes sense."
RomanceBooks,fovc3v5,t1_fov9pbf,1588098833.0,I see your point. Thank you. Because now I can read her books again. They are amazing. I’ll pm you hurt because I don’t feel comfortable spilling.
RomanceBooks,fov8c18,t1_fov7tr1,1588097031.0, Not really because I still kind of love her books and I’m just trying to make my peace with the face that she doesn’t read books in her own genre. It’s been very difficult. I don’t believe you have to read only romance to be a good romance writer but I do believe that you need to at least be a part of the community and I mostly feel that she doesn’t. I know it’s stupid but it’s been hard to read her books or have respect for her as a romance novelist since.
RomanceBooks,fov6gv6,t3_g9pcxl,1588096158.0,Jay Crownovers Point series is my favorite for this. It’s contemporary. There are seven in total.
RomanceBooks,fov63s7,t3_g9q4bv,1588095990.0,I recently found out that one of my favorite writers doesn’t read romance. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. I wish i had not found that out because now I find it difficult to read her books. So I will not be going to those subs even though I considered it.
RomanceBooks,fov4uv1,t3_g9l34e,1588095409.0,"I do this. I read four or five chapters and then skip to then end. Then if I’m interested in how we got from point a to point x, I’ll go back and read the middle. If I really don’t care, I just put the book down and move on. 

But I’m working on this habit and it appears I picked a bad book to do this with."
bipolar,fov4eey,t3_g9nsbo,1588095197.0,I feel this in my soul
bipolar,fov1m34,t3_g9khgm,1588093912.0,"I used to be that way, now I hardly eat anything. But when I do it, it tends to be sweets. It’s all very confusing because sometimes meds make me binge eat. Generally I’m just a mess and don’t know what I want. 

Also happy cake day!"
notebooks,fogzxgh,t3_g7e6pv,1587758920.0,I sometimes skip the first two or three pages.
bipolar,fogzqpy,t3_g76fyx,1587758859.0,Great job!!!
bipolar,fogyxft,t1_fofs74v,1587758579.0,Good luck to you. 💜💜
bipolar,fogydkr,t3_g7d43v,1587758396.0,"Like others have said, it’s a mixed episode and you aren’t alone. I have a lot and unfortunately have no advice as I’m just now getting to an understanding about them. Just know you aren’t alone and they do fade with time."
bipolar,fogxxkp,t3_g7cgpd,1587758251.0,Happy birthday!!!
bulletjournal,focohxt,t3_g6od90,1587673818.0,Happy cake day!
bipolar,fo7zda3,t3_g65ntr,1587587163.0,I have no advice unfortunately but I totally understand where you’re coming from and empathize. Sending support your way.
bipolar,fo7z67l,t3_g62eix,1587587066.0,"Yep!! My manic play lists involve heavy metal music generally. Or some mild rap - I’m an (almost) middle aged white lady who has no business listening to rap. But when I’m manic, bring it on."
bipolar,fo7yzdx,t3_g5v2s6,1587586972.0,"I made a startling revelation about myself and, similar to the day that I realized I actually have bipolar, I feel like it’s going to lead to good things and have a positive impact."
bipolar,fo3r77c,t1_fo3lvtu,1587491622.0,I’ve felt this way as well. I don’t get much out of therapy anymore (or right now) but it definitely gives me a sense of ease in talking to my husband about what is going on in my head.
bipolar,fo3qv9f,t3_g5hdm8,1587491465.0,"You are an inspiration to me. Seriously. I’ve had this diagnosis for a little over 10 years now and I just now am coming to terms with it and making my own self-care, self rituals that will help."
bipolar,fo3qb9c,t3_g5j96a,1587491204.0,Happy birthday! 🎊🎉🎁
bipolar,fo3q7gx,t3_g5au8w,1587491153.0,"Yes. I have a lot of difficulty identifying who I am when I’m not manic or depressed. I feel most like myself when I am stable but I have such a hard time maintaining that feeling. Sometimes I do feel like I push myself into depression or mani just by my thinking. It’s a mess and something I’m actively, painfully working on."
bipolar,fnthi8f,t3_g3kcpr,1587241760.0,"Way to go! Doing a happy dance in celebration for you! And as reiterated above and you yourself, it gets way easier the longer you go. I’m some years removed from my cutting days and each time I think about doing it, I remember how far I’ve come."
Handwriting,fnhbefk,t3_g1qrzl,1586959118.0,Good for her!!! 💜💜
bipolar,fnh3ztl,t3_g1efsz,1586954253.0,Handwriting gives me away every time.
bipolar,fne3ms2,t1_fnd8rfr,1586882470.0,I’m just a baby.
bipolar,fne3kop,t1_fncij5p,1586882441.0,"Her kid is/was in my kid’s kindergarten class so I had some dealings with her. But I was very standoffish and I let her languish in acquaintance because aside from referring to the weather as bipolar, I found her to be rather annoying."
Journaling,fne38c0,t1_fndyu52,1586882269.0,Same.
bipolar,fnc00sz,t3_g0srrw,1586825766.0,Good job!!
bipolar,fnbws54,t3_g0tx70,1586823872.0,It doesn’t offend me but it annoys me to great extent. Someone I met for the first time referred to the weather as bipolar. I’ve sort of held that against her since then. But maybe that says more about me than her.
bipolar,fnbwdau,t3_g0t0zs,1586823634.0,"Yes. This.

Edit. Hey it’s my cake day."
GetOutOfBed,fnb1ggn,t1_fnaq10i,1586807553.0,Same. I would just fall asleep at random. It was way too sedating for me.
AskReddit,fn82nqh,t1_fn7j5jr,1586732621.0,Also have an English Lit degree. I will als die on that hill with you.
Journaling,fn78sig,t3_fzx52s,1586715519.0,"Your handwriting is gorgeous. I, too, suffer from trying to make my journal “perfect”."
bipolar,fmyeruj,t3_fy2c0n,1586484456.0,Thank you. Thank you for getting up every morning and going to work. I know it’s hard and I couldn’t imagine being in your place. I’m in awe of your bravery. I’m too scared to step out my front door and you are on the front lines. Sending you support.
bipolar,fmusl3b,t3_fxfcnh,1586397963.0,It was legit one of the first things I told my now-husband about myself. I was stable when we met but I wanted to let him know. Idk. Sometimes I share too much too often.
Handwriting,fmt7s1w,t3_fx7afc,1586368227.0,That is awesome!
bipolar,fmj4vdg,t3_fvihwi,1586123073.0,Congratulations!!!
bipolar,fmibgmr,t1_fmfurir,1586106243.0,Exactly!! What part is real? It’s so upsetting.
bipolar,fmiba6t,t1_fmg3mo3,1586106138.0,My psych has mentioned this but I don’t have “enough” of the markers to be classified as borderline. But I meet enough that it’s annoying.
Handwriting,fmftkoq,t3_fuozun,1586034559.0,I think it’s awesome
bipolar,fmft06u,t3_fuyz0r,1586034221.0,Yes! I was just thinking this. It’s really not working for me.
bipolar,fmfrv7w,t3_fuxhea,1586033546.0,Thinking of you. 💜
bipolar,fm98bi0,t3_ftmb2v,1585863633.0,Happy birthday!!

bipolar,fksnv9f,t3_fk92sy,1584494331.0,Good for you! That is an awesome feeling!!
bipolar,fkjb8do,t3_fipcs6,1584241059.0,Yes! And my kids are now going to be home for a month. I’m so scared I’m going to completely destabilize
Handwriting,fkefr05,t3_fht5d1,1584112251.0,So pretty to look at.
Handwriting,fk4rw93,t3_fgd1ad,1583866391.0,My handwriting looks a lot like this. 💜

Journaling,fhpwu8q,t3_f4944f,1581796162.0,"I did. I threw away about 12 years worth of journals and I regret it! I could use them for some many things, the least of which being therapy."
Journaling,fhbw1mg,t3_f283jm,1581451076.0,I love this so much!

Journaling,f2mhlao,t3_ddk4j5,1570305403.0,"I relate to this so much. If I try to map out my day, and I miss a step or two, I feel like a failure. I like the idea of writing down what I’d like to accomplish in a day and go from there. Also your handwriting is splendid."
ExposurePorn,f13hsms,t3_d7imuy,1569160593.0,Gorgeous!!!
bipolar,eszkb9x,t3_c9c98o,1562363476.0,"I made my last one at just under 7 years. But that was with 1 lengthy absence and a manager that was mostly understanding when I needed to leave because of things. But I hated and resented them knowing and seeing me manic, depressed, and everywhere in between. My longest before was 2 years and my shortest was 1 month. This May made 1 year without a job."
