MEGA,fqpqokm,t1_fqpp2bj,1589552163.0,"yeah that looks like whats happening to me when its at its worst. Try unchecking the HTTP button. The problem is it will retry the file you where uploading, meaning deleting all progress and starting from zero."
MEGA,fqpnin1,t1_fqplh4m,1589550381.0,"Same. Went from dropbox to Mega. But I feel like im regretting it now as the upload is simply horrid on desktop. Max 2MB/s, but then it drops to 100kb/s and less. And pauses of course. So when uploading a 2GB file it can take all from 30 min to 5 hours lol.

Also seems to help to unchek the ""Don't use HTTP"". But the it gets slow, and it gets faster if you check it again... So im constantly switching it on and off."

AnimalCrossing,fql5i0n,t1_fqka4d3,1589446951.0,Yeah I am the same. If i rushed with time travel it would ruin the tiny excitement I have each night before going to sleep. It really helps you look forward to the next day if your day was shit.

AnimalCrossing,flkyfrh,t1_fliiyf3,1585250045.0,I think it often looks better when you do it yourself. Maybe thats just me. Most pictures people put in look extremely low quality (obviously). So clean and simple pixel art is the way to go.

MOMENT,fj3zp19,t1_fj3zj7e,1582996914.0,Hmm. I’m not sure. It is the filters you got bundled with the Movement lens mount kit?
MOMENT,fj3zdjd,t1_fj3z3e1,1582996703.0,"I will be careful. Thanks for sharing your experience. Yeah, the CPL and UV have just one value. You need to check for variable filters to be able to change it, however as far as I know ND filters are the only ones that has this feature."

So the gimbal stopped working after overloading it with the case + lens + filter and filter mount?

I was trying to research counterweights for the gimbal, but it might just be too heavy overall?"
MOMENT,fj3xjc6,t1_fj3tyf4,1582995484.0,"Yes! I was a little skeptical at first, as I have heard that it had a crossing effect. It does have this effect, but it only appears when you twist it beyond the maximum limit.

So I would recommend as it is cheap for a variable ND filter."

MOMENT,fj3c4px,t1_fj382sd,1582977950.0,Thanks! So what solution did you use?
PS4Dreams,fiie6dn,t1_fiibq1q,1582420370.0,"I managed to figure it out.

I connected the Left Stick into a Value Slider and the slider into a calculator that was set to A = B where B is 0 (as movement gives you a value between 0-1, 0 being standing still and everything above is movement)."

PS4Dreams,fia9c6q,t1_fia8tps,1582296155.0,Also a good suggestion. I totally forgot about the fading inside the timeline.
PS4Dreams,fia8b87,t1_fia75g2,1582295475.0,Oh wow I totally forgot about that tutorial. Yeah that should be easier and cleaner. Thanks!
PS4Dreams,fia5jp0,t3_f7bg0n,1582293534.0,"What I have done here seems over the top for just fading inn and out some text...

Explanation: The top row just controls a flashlight turning on or off.

When the item is collected, the “Collected?” switch turns on. This results in the text appearing via a clock set to 3 seconds.

The first time you activate the flashlight, the other clock makes the text disappear over 3 seconds. Also when this clock ends, it activates the keyframe that deactivate the Text Displayer.


I know you could use the Action Recorder to just record yourself sliding the text opacity up and down, but that isn’t really smooth..."

Edit: Strange. I did put a clean Kitsu in, and all I did was putting a number displayer on too see it’s health. It does indeed lose health when falling."

PS4Dreams,fi42j2h,t1_fi41r7r,1582132664.0,Thanks for the help and the tips. Got it to work with the selector!
PS4Dreams,fi41e0e,t1_fi40osb,1582132002.0,"Ah I see. I tried to use the signal from the And gate to trigger the ability.

Did I miss something?"
PS4Dreams,fi408cb,t1_fi3zbi5,1582131322.0,"Yeah! They seem really amazing! Wish they had some tutorials on them as well. 

But I seem to have a problem. It works, but only for a split second. I might have done something wrong with the calculator. 
I have the Timer output connect to A on the calculator, and set the calculator to = B (B is also set to 0). Is this right? 
Again, the cooldown work, but it only activates for a split second."

Yeah my method also used Clocks, And and Not gates. But the selector always having a true output messes everything up!

Edit: Will your method let me toggle the ability? Thats why I choose the selector in the first place. As I didn’t want the player to keep pressing a button."
