At the end of Dragon Ball he ends up with Bulma, another character, they date until he gets murdered (death is kind of trivial in this series) by a minion of a new antagonist who later becomes a primary character and ally named Vegeta. Vegeta is a total dick and a walking napoleon complex but he becomes the series protagonist Goku's ""friendly"" rival.

Anyway he starts blowing Bulma's back out on the reg while Yamcha, who still loves her, still lives in the same house leading to a son being born. Meanwhile Vegeta just figuratively emasculates him at any opportunity he can because Yamcha is just so weak that he can never get any payback.

What I mean is that most good stories and arcs contain logical endpoints. Satisfying conclusions to that which has been set forward by previous seasons. What follows are more like sequels.

They can contain some awesome bits and even elevate the original but in order to create conflict they typically have to subvert the original satisfying ending. 

They need to create new arcs for characters which is way harder to sell given the fact that the characters have all concluded their arcs. Regression, flanderization, and idiot plots become more common in sequels for this reason.

1. Suffocation by cement: easy to get all of the resources needed in less than half an hour in NYC. Whether he would asphyxiate that quickly is a question but even on waking his ability to break up the solid cement in his own body is a question as well. Grade: C+

2. Diamond tip drill: Could get it on site or use construction equipment to move him within the period relatively easily. It could penetrate but do several holes in his brain stop him? Grade: B+

3. Drowning: see method 1 minus any security that a hardened cement filled windpipe provides. Grade: D

4. Nuke: No effect imo if Thor's ability to tank a star is anything to go by. If Thor can take several seconds of energy produced by fusion then Thanos, being much tougher than Thor, can probably walk that off without a Deus Ex Axe-ina. Grade: D-
