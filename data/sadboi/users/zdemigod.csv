You might think bringing chaos is an exaggeration but what happened here is repeated 10 times and in 4 maybe more someone dies. Imagine if in some of those scenarios the driver truly tried to stop and couldn't that truck driver is now a murderer.  Imagine if something similar happened in a bigger scale. How many people die for this? What's the message left behind the protest then? Do you think it will be a positive one?

Why stop here then? You can murder the ceo of these farms and temporarily stop them. You can murder 1000 drivers and watch them be instantly replaced by another. Where does morality start for this?

There is a right way to do this. This ain't it. I don't respect or approve of anyone would do this kind of reckless protest regardless of the content.

So the game has 4 chapters and then a few smaller posgame chapters that closes the story. When you get to ch4 you unlock an optional dungeon called the palace of the dead. It has 100 floors of long and not very exciting combat. You can clear it at ch4 or at coda1 (coda is posgame). 

In order to unlock an item and a character you need to clear it once in ch4 and beat a bad guy that appeared in ch1 but was MIA until then. When you clear it again in coda2 a new section will unlock and you can go to floor 115. So you can rescue the guy and get your character...
Luckily for the second run you get these items that let's you **skip** 75 floors (3 items per 25 floor) great right?

Except the ch1 bad guy only appears at ch4 and not coda1 so if you reached this coda without clearing PotD (the dungeon) you can't progress! The game let's you rewind back but there goes your first run.


And there is more but I'm just tired thinking about it...



This is from a guide: (worlding is like save loading except it's in the game, you can rewind and go forward to a lot of points in the game)(the guides are the dungeon skip items to floor 75)

""If you did not finish the Palace of the Dead in Chapter 4 and do not have access to these guides, you're going to have to take the full 115 floor trip. If you did defeat Nybeth, but did not record Nybeth's death in an Anchor Point and then used the WORLD function to move around, the Guides will not work. The guides will also not work if you clear the Palace in Chapter 4,t then immediately WORLD back to Coda Episode 2 without re-clearing the game in-between. This means that if you've already finished Episode 1, but haven't killed Nybeth and want to have him flagged as dead in your Warren Report, you will have to go through the Episode once again if you want to skip the 75 floors and fight Blackmoor.

For Emphasis: If you wish for the Palace Guides to work in Episode 2, you must clear both Chapter 4 and Episode 1 with Nybeth flagged as dead. WORLDing around will not help."""

wotv_ffbe,fm0kdrw,t3_fs6itt,1585660103.0,Really? all the ex stages? that's busted... Now I need high leveled friends.
wotv_ffbe,fm0k4i7,t3_fs58z5,1585659916.0,Yea... at least for now I'll just stick to the 1\* max weapons and completely ignore the crafting system. at least until I can control the type.
wotv_ffbe,flz9af5,t3_fs1brj,1585618380.0,"Im afraid because I spent some visiore before informing myself I wont have enough in time for orlandaeu. So I think instead Ill just skip him and focus on whoever is the next ""totally get this guy!"" unit. Because of how tight the resources are everything I do feels like a mistake."
wotv_ffbe,flz7t65,t3_frjo0c,1585617432.0,"This game makes me feel like every choice I make regardless of what I did AND its alternative is a mistake. I spent a bit of visiore on crap before I informed myself. Now worrying that I wont make orlandeau makes me feel really bad. 

&#x200B;

I guess I'll just skip him."
patientgamers,flureo8,t3_fr1bin,1585508454.0,I 100% loved the ending and the whole game. Have in mind negative opinions tend to be louder than positive ones. Its why I always take criticism of games with caution as they are often exaggerated
wotv_ffbe,flujgjy,t3_fr6j3u,1585503827.0,"Great tip! I wish there was something similar for the ex ff14 fight, those keep kicking my ass lol"
wotv_ffbe,flsj03p,t1_fls5p0k,1585443215.0," you can switch between Google and Facebook, so if you want to ""get rid of an account"" all you gotta do is bind it to Google or fb, create a dummy account of the other then bind it to that. 


So real fb > real/dummy Google > dummy fb 
Or real Google > real/dummy fb > dummy google"
wotv_ffbe,flr3etm,t1_flr2kle,1585412149.0,Are you from jp or are you talking from gl experience.
wotv_ffbe,flqtpzl,t3_fpocao,1585405958.0,"Is it a bad idea to invest in macherie? I like her character and I see her shards in the store for visiore, should I buy those if I plan to use her? or is it a bad idea to use her in the first place.

&#x200B;

 I have mediena, ayaka, lilyth/yshotla (idk which yet), mott and macherie."
wotv_ffbe,flqr6ms,t1_flqa6pw,1585404082.0,dude I had no idea you could change explorations i was flabbergasted! This game has a lot of vague info so Keep doing your thing!
truegaming,flpn0s5,t1_flo8dy5,1585363465.0,"This is the game I was looking for, and it is the game I LOVE so much but I cant explain why. I still do love it though.

&#x200B;

Actually never mind I can explain why, I understand the flaws but I dont get affected by them and they got completely overshadowed by the good story and characters and just the experience I had when I played it."
truegaming,flpmw76,t1_flo5899,1585363374.0,Whoever thinks mario strikers is mediocre can go... *Breathes*... Outside to get corona.
wotv_ffbe,floewwj,t3_fpz21u,1585336979.0,Thanks for this! I have been wanting something like this for a while since i want the mats to make mage weapons.
wotv_ffbe,flo6oyu,t1_fln77y2,1585332599.0,"for 2. how *essential* are them though? like will i be able to clear hard content without having both types of dps? what content will thiefs be real important for cuz i dont have any right now... all i have is mages and healers. seeing as i shouldnt be pulling at all and saving visiore for old man i prob will be stuck this way for a while.

&#x200B;

for example magic dps in ffbe are only really needed for moon. but you cant do much hard content without a magic tank and a phy tank. (for different stuff)"
wotv_ffbe,fln5jlf,t1_fllxz5g,1585309811.0,Lol I once used bizzara and the unit move to the panel beside me and insta kod us both.
wotv_ffbe,fln5cej,t3_fpef7j,1585309619.0,"How scared should I be of same element units on a party? Like currently I use moncherie. I plan to invest in her but she is light. Let's say I love WoL (which I do) and plan to get him would I be crippled cuz I leveled a light element unit before then?

How important are ""roles"" in a party. In ffbe it's pretty strict. You need 2 dps 1-2 tank, 2 support, 1 healer. However here all I see that healers are needed for tower but the rest is blank. Currently I use mediena and yshotla together is that bad? How about moncherie and Ayaka? Is moncherie in general a waste? I like her character a lot. 


Also can you put like an ""essential daily"" list of things we should be doing? It would really help everyone to know that."
