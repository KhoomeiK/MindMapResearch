gender is an intricate and personal thing. for some people the idea of gender roles or whatever is clear as day and to other people they wrestle with their gender feelings all their life. person A thinks its all dysphoria vs no dysphoria, person B thinks its a feeling, person C things its all the way you present... people have different ways of viewing gender. someones exterior doesnt have to match their interior. someones expression can be heavily influenced by the world around them. i'm transmasculine and if you asked me how i ""feel"" i guess i would say binary male 100%. but i actually have embraced a non-binary expression of myself because in relation to a cissexist world i don't align with their idea of male and im almost embracing that. its kind of weird lol. but theres an example. to propose an idea whos to say Alpha cant just happen to like 'feminine' things and choose a traditionally feminine name, and also happen to be AFAB, while still thinking their gender isn't the same as a cis girls? 

its always tricky business """"""measuring"""""" oppression, and some people will have definitely more invisibility than others if their expression happens to align with cissexist ideas. this is probably why Alpha is so loud about their non-binary identity, if they keep being misread. i can kind of understand your confusion about this straight seeming couple that seems to you to co-opt some gay terminology, but hey, why make judgements? they can do whatever. theres some fear they might be demeaning the plights of openly cis gay relationships somehow but that cissexism aside it doesnt have to be an us v them compare and contrast, its just people expressing themselves.  

to reiterate, at the end of the day i don't know these people Alpha and Beta. they could be overbearing and flashy about their non-binary label, or you could be misinterpreting and misrepresenting them entirely. but im assuming youre in good faith, so i respect you for just being curious. i think at the end of the day there is no definite definition of gender. you might have a different way of approaching  gender than Alpha or anyone else which is why you are confused. and you dont have to necessarily completely tear down your own idea of your OWN gender experience to respect or recognize Alpha's or any other persons way of presenting or expressing theirs. i just hope this gave some insight and made a little sense."
