I can't hit a hit chunk of the sounds I used to be able to, and my old voice was entirely in that range I can't hit anymore, so singing is.....impossible for me now.

 I also noticed that I naturally speak from my head/throat (where you speak from if you have a higher voice) instead of my chest, and that constantly strains my throat and gives my voice a weird, almost nasally, sound. Its also kinda hard to have a lower voice when you're a quiet person, cause that shit gets loud af when you speak ""properly"" lmao"

AskDocs,fh6dagk,t1_fh4uiqn,1581297530.0,"NAD

Yeah, this. I've got bpd and I deal with dissociation/derealization from time to time. It used to be really bad and give me the worst tunnel vision and the feeling of hearing everything through a long tube. Along with the feeling of nothing being quite real and feeling as if I'm moving too slowly and (sometimes when it's at its worst) I'd have trouble understanding my own native language - I had to put every ounce of my attention on decoding the sounds people were making at me. 

BPD and dissociation tend to be caused by childhood trauma, though not always. Dissociating is a defense mechanism against that trauma that helps in the moment but becomes its own problem once that danger has passed. If you've ruled out physical illnesses, (especially if you have any trauma) definitely go see a therapist to see if you've got bpd or something similar"
