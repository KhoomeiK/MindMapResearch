stopdrinking,f18z0yy,t3_d8apcw,1569265490.0,I was the same. Hated the way I was when drunk. Iâ€™ve got friends who can be an absolute disgrace on it and just brush it off the next day but I always felt horrible for days. The embarrassment over my behaviour actually helped me quit eventually. Good luck staying sober.  Sure youâ€™ll feel so much better for it.

stopdrinking,f173csm,t1_f1732n4,1569234223.0,"Itâ€™s normal to feel stuck. When youâ€™re struggling you feel like it can never get better. Everyone tells you that it will but you donâ€™t believe them. Iâ€™ve been there. It took me a long time to get out of that hopeless mindset. 

Youâ€™ve already made a big step by accepting you have a problem and recognising that you need to change. Good luck. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get there."
stopdrinking,f172yos,t1_f172p5q,1569233862.0,I think most people would view you as mature and smart if you recognise a problem and try to help yourself. Doing nothing or just giving up is far worse.
