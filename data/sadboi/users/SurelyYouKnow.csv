I can look on Ancestry.com for the Census from that time if I have your mom‚Äôs full name and her DOB. 
Or I can just try with her name and year of birth. 
Or heck! Anyone who lives with you‚Äôd, name and bday. Even yours. 

I pay for an ancestry account to research, as my grandmother recently passed. Anyway, I can type your mom‚Äôs name in and it will show me actual copies of the census and should have the kids names on it, as they would be right near yours! 

Any way, if I can find the census page, which should be fairy uncomplicated, then I will have your neighbors names and can likely get their current contact info!

No seriously, it was probably a thought that materialized because you had smoked some herb and some strains cause some people over analyze. 

You see, we all have millions of thoughts a day‚Äîa near constant inner-dialogue, where we don‚Äôt often control  the flow of thoughts. Some unpleasant thoughts are known as [intrusive thoughts](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-sticky-mind/201907/unwanted-intrusive-thoughts%3famp), and can cause a lot of anxiety and even depression if they are very distressing, long lasting, or enhanced by something like existing OCD, trauma, mind-altering substances. 

I think that you really do love this girl, which naturally brings up a lot of anxiety-type emotions, because to *‚Äúlove‚Äù* is to be *vulnerable,* & because you‚Äôd just smoked some pot, this thought may have been enhanced or more noticeable. 
Maybe it caused you to start ruminating on the thought, over-analyzing why you thought it, what it means, etc., psyching yourself out in the process, and causing a negative-feedback loop that really distressed you. 

Rest assured that these are common processes; Your brain is a fine adapted machine, meant to keep you alive, always scanning for threats. Of course you might have a thought here and there, almost as a self-check as to if this relationship is good for you, benefiting you, viable, etc.  it doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love her though. Just somewhat of an auto, self-check!

There is nothing wrong with you. It just sounds like you got high and had a thought that was unpleasant, which was enhanced by said weed. Try to relax and mediate. 

Note: If this or any other thoughts become extremely overwhelming and or continue to cause you distress, please reach out to a doctor or mental health professional, as sometimes these can be symptoms of underlying issues such as anxiety, OCD, and depression."

My vodka-quarantine-induced-theory: 
Yevgeny is the son of the asset and was given up for adoption shortly after her turn by Saul, raised by the Kremlin-into the agent he is now. Ooooh, maybe he is even Saul‚Äôs son! That would be good shit!

Carrie‚Äôs met her match in Yevgeny, he does his homework, finding the means to an end‚Äîat all costs.  Perhaps there is some great culmination of events, wherein Carrie & Saul team up, arriving at a point in which Saul orders Carrie kill him (Saul) to save the world‚Äîwhile Yevgeny stands, watching, with the black box...
Maybe then, the Russian-American Asset (Yevgeny‚Äôs own mother, remember) arrives on scene & shoots Yevgeny, taking the black box & handing it over to Saul & Carrie. Saul and Asset exchange meaningful words‚Äîthanks eachother for lifelong care, companionship, and duty to country above all else. 
Collectively, they save the world from certain WWIII and a very dead Yevgeny takes the sole fall for the bamboozle
The formally empty-suit of a President grows a spine & orders the arrest of his trifling advisor who was working for the Russians. There is a stand-off and the President‚Äôs actual Chief of Staff takes him out, resuming his rank of chief ‚ÄòAdvisor.‚Äô
The President is pleased & orders Carrie‚Äôs charges dropped. She and Saul are awarded the highest honors & a 401k. Maybe some good health insurance. PtSD meds, therapy, et. al....expensive stuff. 
Saul retires; Carrie returns to Frannie, resuming motherhood.

The other FBI woman (Jenna? I think) is promoted‚Äîthe next Carrie‚Äîfinding and killing Haqqani‚Äôs son, Jamal,‚ÄîFrannie and Carrie visit Brody‚Äôs grave. Carrie flashes back to loving things he said. The lay flowers. Cry & Smile. 
The final scene closes with Frannie taking her Oath to the Country as an officer. 
Carrie smiles. Cries. Saul squeezes Carrie‚Äôs hand.

I don‚Äôt think the Producer is innocent, either. I think he burned up the fucking crocodiles, with Joe. I mean, maybe he found out the show was fucked; nobody was picking it up. So he conspired separately with *BOTH* Joe *AND* Carole. Remember the show said she‚Äôd offered him money to burn it down! And it looks like him in the surveillance video. Hunched than a motherfucker. The gait, the hat too. 

Maybe he sold Joe on it: (maybe) Joe could collect on insurance, it would garner sympathy and support of the public, help Joe‚Äôs name stay in the news-bolstering his campaign for presidency (no publicity is bad publicity), there‚Äôd be less animal‚Äôs mouths to feed, & most of all‚ÄîJoe could get rid of all the footage that his attorney got him so worried about. Plus, the Producer could save face. Remember, he had ‚Äúeverything‚Äù riding on this: ‚ÄúI am going to make a million dollars.‚Äù  
So, when it wasn‚Äôt picked up... this allowed him a ‚Äúway out,‚Äù less the embarrassment. 

Producer likely had his equipment insured too, at the very least‚Äîno frikkin‚Äô way a professional like that wouldn‚Äôt have their livelihood insured. So the producer made money twice & Joe was in a winning situation, period. Since Joe would naturally be the 1st one to catch heat (no pun intended), he left town just prior. 

Only the employees weren‚Äôt in on it, so they fetched the surveillance footage and Joe and Producer had to be like ‚Äúoh shit, wow...yeah, let‚Äôs find that bastard!‚Äù

Idk. Maybe not. But after watching this crazy shit...it seems totally plausible to me. Nothing is too crazy.

DiagnoseMe,fn2795f,t3_fyw45b,1586579815.0,"Have you been I‚Äôll lately? A viral infection or anything? 

When you stand, does your heart rate eventually come back down within a few minutes or does it stay high? Or have you been able to stand that long? 
How is your fluid intake? NAD, but as someone with POTS, I would suggest trying lots of fluids and extra Sodium. See if that helps. 
Even if you are just dehydrated and having a hard time getting caught up on fluids, drinking some Gatorade or Pedialyte and water may help you significantly.

Interesting that it started with SoB. How long btwn that symptom and when you first checked your heartrate? Could they have appeared at the same time?

Also, probably good idea to provide pertinent info such as height, weight & if you are taking any medications, supplements, or have any other health issues. :)"

However, I am not sure that these subjects have the level of introspection needed to even find this applicable to them. 
And even if they do, I would wager it unlikely these subjects could maintain a lower-level of faking, when by definition, MBI is much to do with attention-seeking. 

I guess some subjects could be successful... if they weren‚Äôt at the point to even be considered ‚Äúill‚Äù with MBI, (if they were just mild fakers). 
Maybe the question is, ‚ÄúAt what point does it go from ‚Äòexaggerating or feigning illness online to seek attention‚Äô to having an actual mental-illness?‚Äù Is it only when one begins making oneself truly sick, for attention? 

In my opinion, most these girls are so desperate for attention-their actions already so OTT- that I don‚Äôt think they could fly under the radar for very long. 

Their love for the Internet likes, upvotes, ‚Äòsupport‚Äô, sense of comradery, & asspats, fuels their addiction & when that social currency start to wane, they‚Äôd ramp up again & be back to meeting the criteria listed above of someone with MBI. It would be futile it seems."

illnessfakersgonewild,flowjlo,t1_fln9jjt,1585346940.0,"Yep, in part due to [The Sackler dynasty‚Äôs ruthless marketing of painkillers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) which generated billions of dollars‚Äîand millions of addicts.

The New Yorker's article (attached) goes on to explain how Purdue Pharma, privately owned and ruled by the Sackler Family, set out to convince doctors-and that *Oxycontin was the best option* *for most pain conditions*, and that for 99% of people--it was ""Non-Addictive."" And it worked; They were able to persuade doctors to dole out Oxycontin to everyone with an ache, particularly, ""opiate-naive"" patients!

Holy shit...it is a good thing these munchies like Dramanda aren't living in a world where opiates are handed out in the way they were in the past; We'd have no munchies to speak of--they would all be dead. 

**From The New Yorker:** ""A major thrust of the sales campaign was that OxyContin *should be prescribed* not merely for the kind of severe short-term pain associated with surgery or cancer but also for *less acute, longer-lasting pain: arthritis, back pain, sports injuries, fibromyalgia*. The number of conditions that OxyContin could treat seemed almost unlimited. According to internal documents, Purdue officials discovered that many doctors wrongly assumed that oxycodone was *less* *potent than morphine*‚Äîa misconception that the company exploited...Purdue instructed sales representatives to assure doctors‚Äîrepeatedly and without evidence‚Äîthat ‚Äúfewer than one per cent‚Äù of patients who took OxyContin became addicted.""

**TL;DR** Agreed! Big Pharma companies like Purdue, convinced doctor's to specifically prescribe Opiates for pain, rather than other approaches like PT, Chiropractic Care, common sense like RICE, etc. Munchies like these girls would be dead if they had access like they used to."

I ran a Suboxone Clinic & ALL my patients had CP illnesses & moved to Suboxone instead, to either get off of traditional opiates, or to manage their pain less dangerously/more effectively

From my anecdotal experience, Opiates are not very effective for long-term pain mgmt, for pain like we have, although for flares it was a godsend. But the rebound pain, constant re-dosing, dependency, lack of docs, etc. SUCKS. Big suck."
