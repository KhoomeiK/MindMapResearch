WoWRolePlay,fqac0ss,t3_gha7e3,1589216479.0,"Each of these have much more history than what I‚Äôm putting here but I‚Äôm tryna be brief.

My human rogue‚Äôs a Tanari-raised Steamwheedle gadgetsmith/Titan archaeologist who works with the people of Ramkahen to safeguard Uldum‚Äôs relics from bandits and thieves, with the added benefit of being allowed to study them herself. As of late she‚Äôs been busy with the whole Old Gods thing, as well as a personal quest to find out why her family‚Äôs tied to an Infinite dragon‚Äôs plans.

My human monk‚Äôs an Outlands-born orphan that was raised by an exiled arakkoa. She was raised with the belief that only a shadow of Anzu was corrupted, and that Anzu and Rukhmar are still alive and watching over their followers. So, she practices her faith in both, fighting with ancestral sun-blessed talonguards and shadow magic alike, always keeping a balance and a level head lest she be blinded by one power or the other.

My night elf Druid‚Äôs the daughter of high elf nobility, forced to flee during the War of the Ancients and taken pity upon by the Wild Gods. She was put into a thousands-year long slumber, her spirit walking the Emerald Dream, until awakened by a human boy and girl in the middle of the Second War. The trio would become best friends and work together as heroes against many odds. They also freed a red dragon during the Second War, who would later on accept my night elf as Dragonsworn.

I got more but those three are my most unique + fleshed out ones."

- you could be separate from the Illidari entirely, or even from being a demon hunter entirely, opening a lot more options (maybe a rogue warlock? A curse? Magical experiment gone wrong? Warrior who thought of fighting fire with fire as well?)
- as others have said, even if you go the Illidari route, your character‚Äôs origins and backstory are still fair game - and arguably, your character could have not been captured by the Wardens, and thus those years are fair game as well. Depending on your character‚Äôs age that can be thousands of years of character development and story.
- one‚Äôs personality and actions carries all characters, not just demon hunters. You can have the blandest story in existence and still be incredibly interesting to RP with.
- Death Knight‚Äôs lore has been laid out for them also, yet people have figured out how to be creative with them! And they‚Äôve had a lot more time to do so than demon hunters

Maybe the Horde‚Äôs trying to reinforce its grounds in Howling Fjord again, because it‚Äôs the nearest place they could prepare for a naval invasion/retaking of Undercity, and your guild is sent out to stop them. That could be a cool campaign, or just one event, up to you. Maybe your guild is tasked with sailing to Zandalar to spy on its defenses. Maybe you‚Äôre sent to capture an island in a strategic position between, idk, Pandaria and Eastern Kingdoms, and have to stop the Horde from getting it first or else they have a clear shot on Stormwind.

WoWRolePlay,fl6oa4d,t3_fkra0m,1584877695.0,"Other questions to consider; would your vulpera want a pet/pets by his side for his adventures? If so, what kind of pet; a small companion or a big hunter-pet?

Would he prefer taking down his enemies from afar or up close? If he‚Äôs a storyteller, it could go both ways; maybe he likes to stay far away so he can get the perfect viewing distance, or he likes to get up close to better feel the emotions and drama of his battles.

His use of plants sounds a bit secondary how you‚Äôre telling it; sounds like you want mostly a reclusive journalist and storyteller sitting by a cozy fire under the desert stars. He could have basic knowledge of what plants are poisonous and use them for poisons on his weapons, both as a rogue and a hunter, but not make it his main focus, just a way he survives. His main focus on plants would be getting pigments for his inks.

Both are similar in their play styles tbh. I think the main question is whether or not you want a pet. My engineer for example would benefit more if she was a hunter, but I ultimately 1) didn‚Äôt want a pet and 2) didn‚Äôt want to play marksman for no pet, so she‚Äôs a rogue instead. I still roleplay her using a gun sometimes, but rogues can equip guns for RP purposes, and she usually uses gadgets or throwing her pickaxe to do stuff, so it works out.

As for which spec to play, I usually don‚Äôt base that on the RP part at all. You can always switch specs for RP. My monk does that so she can dual wield a glowing-claw fist weapon, even though I use her OOCly as a Brewmaster. Play what‚Äôs most fun for you :3"

In the drawing, it feels like she‚Äôs floating there because her left foot/leg isn‚Äôt supporting her weight, and you don‚Äôt see the lean-back because her chest and face are front-facing. Major improvement and it feels like she‚Äôs moving a lot more fluidly with the clothes moving with her and everything.

You improved a lot on the shadows too, though I notice on the legs you changed up some shadows that were pointing the right direction. Even with brighter lighting or multi-source lighting there‚Äôs usually a single most powerful source that all the shadows are drawn in conjunction to. The rest of your shading indicates that this stronger source is coming from the middle-right or top-right side of the drawing, so you can base shadows off of that. The shadows themselves become darker or lighter depending on what other lights are in the setting. For example, light from the sun bounces everywhere so our shadows aren‚Äôt pitch black, but we still have a ‚Äòprimary‚Äô shadow facing opposite of the sun."
Artadvice,ff154wf,t3_er34kv,1579475307.0,"I think it‚Äôs partially because you‚Äôre not entirely confident with your character in a 3D space. The jacket for example has shading near the middle but there‚Äôs no indication that it should. The environment your character‚Äôs in also looks very bright since you have softer shadows. Maybe practicing with a single light source would help.

I suggest drawing 3D shapes like spheres, cubes, etc., choosing a single light source, and looking up how shading works on a figure and studying/drawing it as close as you can. Having a good understanding of light really helps with having a good understanding of dark. You can also crumple up a piece of paper and put it in front of you, trying to copy it as close as possible focusing on the areas of light and dark.

Even when drawing cartoonish characters, knowing how to shade 3D really helps it feel like the character is anchored to the setting. Hope this helps!"

The story centers around the three characters and mainly how they struggle with being on their own, relying on one another to fill the void the circumstances put them into. ‚ÄúThree they were, lost, and found in one another.‚Äù I suppose the essential parts are some kind of encroaching unstoppable faction (the fel-crazed Horde), another faction they must send warning to (Lordaeron or Stromgarde), powerful enemies/allies they encounter along the way that make their journey possible/challenging (a demon main antagonist and a red dragon), pre-story elements (each character has a unique origin that plays into the story and explains how they‚Äôre all there), and a magic system (each main character uses a different form of magic that give them unique advantages/disadvantages). Laying out all the pieces makes me realize I have a lot more freedom in how I do this story if I develop a world on my own, thank you for opening my eyes.

I asked in this subreddit because I have 2/3 of the main characters as playable versions in WoW, and I roleplay them with this vague story idea in mind.

warcraftlore,fcen2kv,t3_eftaul,1577622001.0,"Resto Druid main here. I roleplay a lot, so I face niche issues with Druid abilities like this often. Here is my fanon, AKA non-canon speculation, on how their abilities work:

The energy Balance uses is connected to Arcane magic as well as Nature magic. We know that Arcane magic forms usually-invisible leylines and pathways through Azeroth and the cosmos. We also know that Nature magic is Life in magic-form. I view the Druids‚Äô magic as a method of collecting and harnessing the arcane and nature energy around them.

If not given a nearby living ecosystem to draw off of, druids draw Life (what nature magic embodies) from themselves and give it to the plants/spells they wish to grow/cast. The more powerful the Druid, the better/stronger they are at doing this, because they can withhold more Life energy in them than normal people, same as a Mage can hold more Arcane energy. I RP my druid having a potent aura that noticeably drains as she uses spells because of this.

As Arcane magic is prevalent in pretty much all of Azeroth, it is safe to assume they can draw from leylines or possess arcane artifacts that they must recharge from time to time. Faerie Dragons for example use a lot of arcane magic, and in the Druid order hall a faerie dragon actually asks you to retrieve an arcane artifact so they may use its potent power to heal the Emerald Dream.

So Druids use Nature and Arcane magic hand in hand for a lot of their abilities. That yet still begs the question: How do they do stuff like Hurricanes or Moonfire/Sunfire/Starfire/etc.?

Hurricanes and other elemental-looking abilities are, in my speculation, similar to how Arcane magic can create fire or ice. Mages do not call upon elementals for aid, yet can still use the elements. How so? Because they manipulate it in a third-party sort of fashion. They use arcane and drain or enhance the amount of energy in that space, creating ice or fire respectively. Like when you put water on a stove and it boils into steam, or put it in a freezer and it freezes into ice, except these processes are done much faster and with arcane as its conduit. You don‚Äôt call upon a fire elemental to make your soup, you just heat it up yourself. Druids do a similar third party influence, throwing nature magic into the mix. Maybe they manipulate the air by starting a spin manually with arcane/nature magic, cranking it up to 11 until it can sustain itself and mimic the strength of an air elemental for a brief time. I do not believe they call upon elementals personally, they just manipulate the elements around them to perform elemental-like actions.

Now what about Moonfire/Sunfire/Starfire etc.? Here‚Äôs where their connection with Elune comes in. I don‚Äôt think the abilities come from the moon or sun themselves, but are instead mimics of the celestial being‚Äôs powers, crafted with arcane/nature magic. Starfire isn‚Äôt actual stars, but rather energy coalesced to look like stars. Would they be stronger under their respective time of day/night though? Yes, because if the casters are devouts of gods, those gods will in turn bless their abilities when they act under their watch. Elune empowers her followers when she is in the sky, not because the abilities are directly from Mother Moon, but because they are conjured in her honor and she blesses them in turn. The Sun though, I‚Äôm lost there tbh lmao.

That‚Äôs my take on it anyway, I have no log of sources to support this, it‚Äôs just what I think.

Edit: To answer your question: Yes, druids can use abilities at any time as long as they have materials (seeds for plants for example) and the energy required (Nature/Arcane magic) to make it happen. However, day/night cycles do empower their respective sun/moon abilities because the god(s) that embody those celestial markers bless their followers with their presence. Weather/Seasons? Ehhh. I suppose it‚Äôs harder to keep your plants alive in howling winds or freezing temperatures, but they wouldn‚Äôt be empowered by weather or climate alone. Perhaps empowered by nearby flourishing plant life that comes with Spring for example, but that‚Äôs an affect of weather/climate, not weather/climate themselves."

For Night Elves:

- Body Tattoos for Elune/WildGods/Dragons, as all 3 are big factors in night elven culture. Or heck just general nature/sentinel/priest tattoo vibes.

- More eye color options. Many night elf NPCs have different colored eyes, like Green or Golden.
- More hair color options. Why can players of night elf DKs have bright pink hair but players of other classes can‚Äôt, despite night elf NPCs of other classes being able to? Also, red hair would look amazing on night elves.

For all races:

- Glasses. Not shades or goggles, proper glasses. Some Kul Titan NPCs have them, so they‚Äôre already in the game! Maybe just a headpiece for transmog?

- Freckles/scars/other skin details. Maybe our mighty champions walk away with a scar sometimes, the horror. I know some races have stuff like this but not all do.

learnart,fbdm1wd,t3_ecei59,1576765900.0,"If your lines are shaky or circles wonky, I suggest taking a piece of paper and a brush and going down the page, making a straight line, and varying the level of pressure hard to light to hard etc. Then doing the same thing next to that line in opposite fashion (light to hard to light etc). For circles, draw circles over and over while trying to keep them the same size/shape and closing them smoothly.

Also, if your session goes longer than 45 minutes, add a 10-20 minute break in between so the daily practice sessions don‚Äôt feel overwhelming. Hope this helps!"
Artadvice,fbdk7pe,t3_ecrsnx,1576764519.0,"I love your style! I‚Äôd recommend embracing the cartoony feel/thick outlines you use in most of this picture. The nose is the only space with tons of tiny scratchy lines which makes it look a little off (though I still like it). I‚Äôd also recommend studying 3D aspects. Your character feels very flat, reminding me of a lot of cartoons which use thick untapered lines and flat silhouettes to help make animation easier. Which is great if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for, but if you want more realism I‚Äôd start there. Finally I‚Äôd recommend not being afraid of shading darker/lighter. I can see a lot of your strokes in the drawing along with very faint shading, but unless you zoom in you hardly see it. Again, cartoons tend to ignore shading unless needed for visual effect (some do, anyway), so that‚Äôs okay for animation but draws away from detail/realism for still images.

Keep at it! I‚Äôm hoping to improve my art this year too. I have a small Wacom tablet for digital, was about 70-80$ I think. I recommend the drawing program Krita, it‚Äôs 100% free, catered to artists/animators specifically, and they do not claim any work you do in their program, meaning you can monetize your drawings without them wanting any moolah. I also suggest reading their guides and watching a few videos on what all the bells and whistles do, it can be overwhelming at first. As a side note, on digital you can fill in spaces with color with a single click, which can help you quickly establish a flat color before shading. Happy drawing! :D"

warcraftlore,fagrigd,t1_fafpwjx,1576068930.0,"Thank you! Her story is very long haha, it was so fun making it.

She has the regular Cenarion forms because she was taught Druidism in Mount Hyjal with other druids. Most Druids are technically Dragonsworn to the Emerald Dragonflight (Ysera and the Dream), plus she doesn‚Äôt know the specifics of her forms as much as Claws or Talons for instance, so I felt no need to make them special. I suppose her treant form is a bit different, with her growing into a massive tree with her silhouette still visible like she was carved out from the tree.

She does have some cool traits that come with being Dragonsworn, though. She can (sparingly) cast out red dragon‚Äôs flame to purge and renew life. She can speak Draconic, a necessity when working with dragons. She also has a powerful blackthorn shillelagh that was gifted to her by her Ruby dragon shan‚Äôdo Noristrasza, which grows into whatever shape is needed to house differing plant life. I‚Äôm also debating on letting her connect with Noristrasza telepathically, but I can‚Äôt find any WoW lore that backs this, there‚Äôs so little known about Dragonsworn."
warcraftlore,fafpacm,t3_e8zih1,1576028487.0,"My character‚Äôs a night elf Dragonsworn trained in the Druidic arts. She was heavily influenced by human culture, having woken up in the Eastern Kingdoms (long story). Became Dragonsworn to a Ruby dragon shortly after the Second War, then to an Emerald after the battle for Mount Hyjal. She‚Äôs got a looong story but those are some important bits.

She‚Äôs this very curious and giddy elf who loves to learn about the world. She‚Äôs been around night elven culture more now over the years, so her human influence is dimmed somewhat, though she‚Äôs definitely less reserved and more friendly to outsiders. Since Aessina is her wild god of prayer, she hangs out with dryads a lot, and pretty much acts like them to help visualize. With green hair and rosy skin, she‚Äôs basically a happy strawberry-colored forest lady who will give you hugs and fruit baskets.

She‚Äôs been very tired and clinging to hope as of late due to the Void attacking the Emerald Dream and trying to consume what Emerald Dragons that are left. She‚Äôs trying her best to help though!"
WoWRolePlay,faf24uf,t1_faeq59z,1576012941.0,I know right?! Dragonsworn are so cool! Druids are the closest you can get right now since most are technically Dragonsworn (Emerald Dragonflight). Though my druid serves the Ruby Dragonflight as well thanks to past events. It‚Äôs very fun RPing one :D

WoWRolePlay,fabv4ud,t3_e7ag48,1575929318.0,"I keep backstories of my characters on a google doc, then random facts/essentials in my in-game Notes and About pages.

My About page is super simple for a reason; in addition to keeping it short and sweet for readers, it quickly reminds me of the character‚Äôs vibe/personality and appearance.

My Notes page is for quick/minor stuff, just anything that comes to mind that‚Äôs good to know. For example, my Druid‚Äôs notes have stuff like this:
- She can tap dance really well.
- She knows Draconic.
- She was in these major WoW events: ____
- Undead can be mended with thorns that stitch them up.

It also helps that I mostly only play 2-3 characters who are all very different. My strict militaristic priestess, my sarcastic Titan-archaeologist/engineer, and my joyful Dragonsworn druidess. (Lowkey, although I love my priestess in writing, she‚Äôs a drab to RP so I tend to favor my Archaeologist and Dragonsworn gals.)

WoWRolePlay,fabpc77,t3_e89vb0,1575926698.0,"I love the new character concept! The other two commenters here have given great advice, so I can‚Äôt really add much.

If you‚Äôre still on the fence for the race change, I‚Äôd say night elves are still a super viable option entirely separate from the war. My nelf Druid‚Äôs a Dragonsworn for instance, so she simply cannot give up her duty to the dragons in favor of vengeance, nor would her personality render such even an option. For a civilian cook type, you could be a renowned cook from any region (maybe Winterspring?) who makes incredible kimchi or something.

A disc was found in the sands of Uldum and she was tasked by the Ramkahen there to help them figure out what it was. I did a small event with my guild about it. It turned out to be a data disc, whose data was a key to an ancient power, but before we could safeguard it, it was stolen by a Windlord and we had to fly to the edge of the Skywall to try and get it back. Upon his defeat, the Windlord‚Äôs essence merged with the disc and made it capable of flight. We returned it to the Ramkahen, who transferred the data to a secret Titan module for protection and gifted the empty disc to my rogue. Since she‚Äôs an engineer, she added stuff like stabilizers and GPS and the like, fitted into a top metal overlay for her to stand on.

Now any time I use that mount, it reminds me of who she is as a character. It‚Äôs a nice personal touch. I like your character‚Äôs mount story as well :D"

My main page has little on it. Most of the default stuff. I might add one or two Additional details, like voice-references or family relations, but that‚Äôs it. No personality tabs.

My About page is short and sweet. It comprises of an icon, my character‚Äôs name, some titles that describe their status/nicknames, two short paragraphs detailing the character‚Äôs personality/appearance (giving the reader my character‚Äôs vibe), links for theme song and drawings, then some brief OOC notes.

I keep my glances to one or two brief sentences. I keep in mind what people would initially notice of my character, or what details my in-game model cannot express, and put it there.

In the end it‚Äôs up to you. My advice would be to stay clear, concise, and to the point. Write to your heart‚Äôs content, save that in a separate document to help you retain the character‚Äôs proper vibe, then trim the in-game version so it‚Äôs short and sweet."

Maybe try to eat tasty, but also healthy things around her and encourage her to try whatever you‚Äôre eating. A lot of fruits taste even better than candy anyway. As for vegetables, having them ridiculously drenched in a tasty sauce is still better than no vegetables at all!

Positive reinforcement can go much farther than forced reinforcement imo. Voice your concerns clearly and often to your sister and try to have her make small compromises. And... honestly, it‚Äôs all you can do without causing a ruckus. She‚Äôs old enough to know she should eat healthy and exercise. You can bring a horse to the river but not make it drink, you know?
