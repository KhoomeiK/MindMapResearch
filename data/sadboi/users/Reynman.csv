She but the other dogs ear and put a hole in it but she didn’t shake and tear it. I was at the waterfall and I think she just didn’t hear the other dog walking up behind her and got surprised. I can definitely use some training myself cause she’s done just fine until that. I just want to make sure it never happens again.
