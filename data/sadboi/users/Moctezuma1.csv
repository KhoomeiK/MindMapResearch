When my ex-wife left me, she ran straight to her mother's home. Her mother called me right away. I was married for 13 years and had always had her family's love. Her daughter told her she wasn't happy and decided to move out. I found out she had been cheating for months and told her mother. Her mother was very disappointed and took our marriage vows very serious. 

I can tell you this, I was at the brink of suicide. She left me and our daughters. I felt hopeless, depressed and unloved. Her family and mine stepped in and made sure we were well cared for and loved. She of course also was there for her daughter. She has always lectured us about integrity, respect and loyalty. 

4 years later, my ex-wife is still living with her boyfriend. I  share custody of our daughters. And her family still offers love and support, they do not choose sides. But I am still considered family. I will love my mother in law for being such a great woman and showing our daughters that family stand by one and should always do the right thing. 

I have so much respect for you."

AskWomen,fj4h37g,t3_fbcoqp,1583008114.0,"When I was young recently graduated high school, I got a good paying job, nice apartment, new credit card, and bought a nice used car priced reasonably.

Few months out, my car squeaked, but had no issue braking. Took it to Midas for their ""free"" brake check. I was not mechanically inclined so i believed everything they suggest I replace or my car will have more problems.

I was there my whole Saturday and ended up paying $1,200 for a simple brake job. Which i charged my new credit card, which led to higher interest when i couldn't pay monthly. Took me 3 years to pay off.

I enrolled in a automobile repair course. I have been fixing my own car for years now."

For $700, you would think the developer could add a automatic saving feature when entering notes. My phone rang and helped a client, the software logs you off after a few minutes of inactivity... Notes are not saved."

Both cameras started glitching. Against my judgment, i upgraded their iPhones to 8 because they refused to abandon Apple's ecosystem.

As for me, I prefer not to update to the latest Android OS. I have a Note 8 on Pie, but can't root or xposed. And the same, i don't feel like downgrading either now that I'm used to using Pie.

I miss all the apps and features that root offers."
Friendzone,fivncch,t3_f4cqcb,1582763860.0,"I disagree with being mean, just be forward and honest.

Tell him you are not interested in being his friend, girlfriend, or associate in a calm, respectful way. No need to be mean and just be forward nicely. Let him know that you no longer welcome his phone calls, texts or chit chats. Then block his phone number.

If he continues, unfortunately, you may have to proceed with a temporary restraining order, if you are in the US.

Reason I am not advocating to be mean, you don't know if he would react violently."

Found this interesting article about only using only MFi cables that are certified by Apple.
