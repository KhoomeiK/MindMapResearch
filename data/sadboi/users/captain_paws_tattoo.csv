I wouldn't know what to say either. Something that has helped me is writing everything down. This helped me process and gather my thoughts and feelings. I've then written those more coherent and specific thoughts and feelings down as letter and read it to them (asking for no interruptions). This gave me the confidence of feeling like I'm not just going to emotionally spew all over the place and not make sense during the conversation. I've also just done bullet points of what I wanted to get across. 

Using this method, I stuck to a lot of 'when you did that, I felt this' statements. Think about what you want the goals of the conversation to be and include that. ""I want to work on more solid boundaries, for you to understand how this has made me feel and effected me, improve communication overall, understand your thought process in this mess, etc..."" 

Do not let him try to justify why he did it. Your not looking for his justifications, you're only looking for explanations. Sometimes people will try to get you to get on board with why they did something that was hurtful and thats NOT what this is about. You can understand and not agree. On the flip side, you do not need to justify your feelings. They are what they are and they are due to these actions.

I really hope your conversation with him goes well and you get everything you need. Feel free to DM me if you need to."

If they get mad, tell them that they were not respecting your struggles and roll as a member of the family. You need to set boundaries and develop your own coping skills to help ensure a healthy transition to this new member of your family and you feel they are refusing to help you do that. 

Nothing you are asking for is unreasonable. The room thing is tricky, but that's something that should be discussed and processed to reach a mutual compromise or decision (preferably in therapy because it doesn't sound like they are listening to you or wanting to see things from your point of view).

Also, you're only 15 and not her guardian or parent. You should NOT be expected to be responsible for a child with severe problems that is basically a stranger."

Look at their company or corporate page to see if they do charitable work and say that's a reason or see if that location has a FB page with info. Only give 1 maybe 2 reasons like pay and benefits, then 2 suck up reasons. People and interviewers LOVE to hear how great they/their company is.

We went to counseling and it got ever so slightly better until it didn't again. I tried walking on eggshells and changing my behavior and pieces of my personality, didn't work. His friends would even give him shit. It was like he didnt have the capability to not do it. The only reason I can deduce for this inability, was he thought he was completely right and justified all the time and thought he was ""helping"" even when the exact opposite was true. His ego would not allow him to not be better than everything. He knew best.

Spoiler: he didn't and I'm pretty sure still doesn't (don't know that for sure because we didnt have kids so zero reason to stay in touch thank god!).

Honestly, if you're super concerned, I agree with the other commenter that you could call a helpline if available or just go to urgent care/ER."

Advice,ffpjt0m,t1_ffpixde,1580096752.0,"No! Do not do this! Call the police. If they need you to do anything they will let you know. Trying to gather evidence on your own can be dangerous. Also, could be considered tampering with evidence and the case could get thrown out. I.e. their lawyers could argue that YOU planted the CP after you took the hard drive."

AmItheAsshole,ffntfyu,t3_eu903q,1580070572.0,NAH. I want to add that my brother (athiest) committed suicide and in his notes his only want was to be cremated. That allowed my Mom and Dad to have the full Catholic everything which gave them peace they could only receive through their faith. His partner (agnostic) allowed this because she knew it was what they needed to do and he would have wanted to have whatever they needed. She and his friends put together a memorial in celebration of his life and art which my parents also attended and were grateful for. It allowed them to see what an impact he made on so many lives (there were a couple hundred people there). I really like the idea other people have about a living funeral that shows your true life and beliefs. Maybe this could be a good compromise?
