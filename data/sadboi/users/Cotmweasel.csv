I highly encourage you to be honest with yourself. And when you see a therapist, be as open as you can be. The therapist office is a safe place. Discuss what you need to discuss."

I've thought I had: bipolar, sociopath, narcissist, cancer and I don't even remember the other ones.

Nightcry is also a 'spiritual successor' (though it's pretty awful). 


Another game with similar mechanics that I would actually recommend is 'remothered: tormented fathers'. It's actually fantastically done and you can tell the main character is modeled after Clarice (jodie foster, silence of the lambs)."
