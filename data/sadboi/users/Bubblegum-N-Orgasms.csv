cats,fpe3gpu,t1_fpe2hos,1588539600.0,"So she was actually adopted as a kitten by my sister. I moved in with my sister temporarily soon after that. Then I moved and wasn’t around for a few years. Then a couple years after that Olive left one night (as she was indoor/outdoor) and never came back home. This happened while my sister was moving to a new house (luckily only a few neighborhoods away). My sister looked for this cat for three years. Then one day about a year or so ago, she magically appeared on the doorstep of my sisters new house! We thought she was gone forever. So she stayed indoors only. But my sister wanted to re-home her, because sister just had two babies in two years (and made her an outdoor only kitten at that point). So we just bought our first house and I happily adopted Olive. She doesn’t go NEAR the outside now. She definitely had an adjustment period and cat CBD has helped a lot. And she knows who I am and remembers me at least. She feels very at home now! Sorry for so much text but I thought it was an interesting story."

Am I going to take an extra couple minutes for my break or Aux out after that long exhausting call? Fuck yes. Ok my adherence will go down but it’s worth it for my sanity.

therapy,fl4kigg,t3_fm350i,1584815493.0,Not for me. I was basically lonely for the past year. I lost my social life to to medical reasons. And I was JUST recovered enough to start getting back out there and meeting new friends. Now I can’t go on tinder dates or meet engine new. Stuck in the house now...alone.
homeowners,fl3l1t7,t3_eqhvzb,1584788960.0,Anyone else have brand recommendations? I recently got ADT but declined to add the water and glass breaking sensors anywhere except the master bedroom. The prices add up quick. But I will check on amazon if no one else has experience on here. Thanks!

AskReddit,fl14ti2,t1_fl14ojr,1584722022.0,Oh man I forgot about that part. I have my medical marijuana card because I keep having surgeries and don’t want to get back on painkillers. Not that I could if I wanted to. I’m 34.
AskReddit,fl14hsh,t1_fl0xemb,1584721841.0,"Luckily I work from home doing customer service for a company I have worked for and been top in my DEPT, so I feel pretty secure. I just hate my job and was really looking forward to moving on. But trying to be grateful I even have a job right now. I doubt govt would hire me I have misdemeanor drug charges on my record from 6 years ago."

AskReddit,fl0fdx1,t1_fkynedh,1584704526.0,Even the remote jobs I applied for both just sent me a response saying the positions/hiring have been postponed indefinitely. But hopefully since she has already been hired she will be ok.
AskReddit,fl0f7ni,t1_fkzw5b4,1584704347.0,"Getting hit twice now. First time in 2008 graduating college. Eventually found a job in a call center (psychology BA) and started working my way up there. Have hated my current position for last year. Had too many medical issues to make any changes. JUST started applying for other jobs two weeks ago...and now all the companies I have applied said they are freezing new hiring immediately and indefinitely. So there goes that. I am trying to be grateful that I have a job at all right now. But when I was only getting by thinking it was only for x longer, now there’s nothing else good to grasp onto. It’s rough out there."
