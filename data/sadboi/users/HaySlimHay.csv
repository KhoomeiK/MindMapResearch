EverythingScience,eum172b,t3_cgrujz,1563910023.0,"Here‚Äôs how it work. 

Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide  are produced by factory‚Äôs. 

Those gasses are then in our air and ozone layer basically and those gasses absorb and trap heat which is causing a rise in our temperature. 

Since there in a rise in Temperature, there‚Äôs a rise in sea level. Since there is a rise in sea level major cities that are on bays or by beaches will end up flooding and people will have to move.  

What‚Äôs also causing problems? Some people (Politicians)  don‚Äôt believe in global warming. And if you take a second to think about that...it‚Äôs actually horrifying. The earth is getting hotter, places are flooding because things are melting, food is getting sprayed with pesticides. Why don‚Äôt the politicians see the problem? Money. Pretty simple and sad but MONEY. No factories means no jobs, which means not much of an economy structure. 

Since politicians won‚Äôt step up to make a change. We can. Walking or biking place. Getting gas at certain times of the day. Lots of way we can change the world."

memes,euesmms,t3_cg0zkr,1563752810.0,"On a serious note...society does this to men way too much. Men should be allowed to share emotions and talk about feelings and go through hard times just like girls. Calling a man or boy  a pussy for expressing anything other than masculinity is ridiculous! 

Men are more likely to commit suicide over women. True fact. Why? Because men don‚Äôt seek the help they need because they are constantly told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù Let someone get the help they need. Whether it‚Äôs with life, relationships, money, etc. As a girl we don‚Äôt always like admitting we need help but we do it cause we know we won‚Äôt be judged. But men should be able to ask for help without being called anything negative."

wholesomememes,eu9xbcn,t3_cfc8um,1563593631.0,"My grandma passed away about a month ago due to breast cancer at 69 years old and the one thing she asked us to do was donate to the little kids suffering from any time of cancer. She said no one should have to endure what she went though and the thought of kids going through it all broke her heart. 

She asked that when we check out at grocery store and the clerk asks if you‚Äôd like to donate to cancer research always do it. Even if it‚Äôs $1 dollar. 

Every time I‚Äôm asked I always donate at least $5.
