For this circumstance; my name is reasonably unusual with a non-traditional spelling, people get it wrong not frequently but often enough. I never correct anyone on how they’ve written my name because in my mind it’s not a big deal and there’s no reason to point it out and potentially upset someone.

So if I compare her response to what mine would have been, in my mind the reason she’s responded this way is because it is a big deal to her and she’s upset."

One, Winston, we got when he was so little his eyes were virtually still closed (he was a rescue). I was a young adult at the time in between University semesters and recovering from a bad break up. He was basically the only thing I had going in my life so he got a huge amount of attention and honestly was a giant sook as a result who couldn’t go more than 3 hours without getting a human cuddle or he would become really upset and stressed. I probably over socialized him if I’m being honest. 

Another, Charlie, I got because family of someone I knew never got their cat deserved and she had kittens once or twice a year. I wasn’t intending on getting him because I didn’t think I had the time to devote to a new kitten, but he 100% chose me. I felt some pressure to take him and he was (is) honestly too adorable and devilish for me to say no. I didn’t get him until he was fully weaned off his mother and worked half days when I first got him. He’s completely different in terms of socialization. Very friendly and likes to spend time in the same room as you, but isn’t as into being touched and is very unlikely to jump up on your lap - more inclined to sit next to you on a couch and rest his head against you. All the kittens in the home he came from originally are left entirely to their own devices, so all in all he had a lot less people attention in his kittenhood and I think that’s a big part of why he isn’t as cuddly."

When you first get it show it the water bowl by tapping its paw/s in there, let it clean itself off and it will realise “that’s water.” And gently use its two front paws in a digging motion in the litter. Cats instinctively want to cover up their toilet to hide it from predators and prey alike. If that’s the only place the kitten can cover up its messes it will likely use the litter straight up. Be careful not to have any towels lying around it could use instead, one time I left a bath mat down and came into a room with a poop on the floor and the corner of the bath mat covering it up."

Every time I make a mistake I have an anxiety attack, which is insane because a) I’m not even making that many and b) no one can actually watch me doing any work - just send me instructions and then check it over afterwards, so of course there are going to be a couple of errors. 

I also feel like if I’m not constantly thinking about others and putting their needs first people will think I’m an awful person, but when other people don’t treat me that way (and no one does because other people are normal and healthy) I think it’s because they don’t think I’m worth treating better.

But the solution isn’t to have a go at the person who is providing a good percentage tip! The problem is that tipped wages exist at all instead of a living wage.

On a slightly less diplomatic note, they’re honestly lucky people are still tipping them if the service I’ve been receiving from GrubHub is common across all delivery platforms. I’ve literal had someone leave my food on the sidewalk in front of the apartment building across the road from mine. And they still got my 20% tip because you have no idea what kind of service you’re going to get when you pre-tip and pay. So in my opinion instead of complaining over a fucking dollar they should be grateful that the bad drivers aren’t resulting in every customer stiffing them."

minimalism,fpggqe9,t3_gd197a,1588602368.0,"I honestly recommend calorie counting / a food journal to start with. Figure out where you’re eating junk and cut that out first. 

I didn’t realise how much I snacked on bad stuff until I did that. Then I started making my household food kore minimalistic. Cutting out soda’s and snacks I didn’t really need, only buying desserts for special occasions etc."
Anxiety,fpgazf6,t3_gd34dh,1588598837.0,I love to fantasize about running away from my life and starting over as a hermit where no one will never get to know me and I can just be safe and alone forever.
TwoXChromosomes,fpd161i,t3_gckrdq,1588517604.0,"I would have liked for this film to end differently. 

I think she should have let Jim die. I think it would have been realistic that she felt too violated by what he did to her to ever feel comfortable around him again. I also think that when presented with the choice of “risk own life to save crazy stalker who already ruined said life and has low chance of survival here anyway” or “do nothing while crazy guy who makes me feel unsafe dies” that choosing the second option isn’t unrealistic. 

Then I would have liked to see a bit of a time lapse where we start to see her exhibiting the same behaviors that Jim did as the loneliness and solitude started to get to him. And the last frame of the film could have been her sitting next to a pod and starting to watch the videos of that person like Jim did with her. The implication being that the cycle is going to repeat itself. 

Then the movie wouldn’t have been a love story. It would have been some interesting commentary on the social aspect of humanity and what other parts of our humanity or morality we are willing to sacrifice in order to have it."

It sucks when you figure out that your parent/s love your sibling more, but you their love isn’t the way you define yourself and you’re clearly loved by others for the wonderful person you are x"

wokekids,fp6i303,t1_fp6d46q,1588352715.0,Yeah so? I’ve met 3 year olds who know the names of famous people before. Do you think children don’t listen to the adults around them and pick up on what’s being said? How do you think they learn things before formal education?

aww,fp62xdk,t3_gb6ccd,1588345062.0,"My family used to have a Rottweiler. His name was Bumpa. One day I got given a very tiny little kitten (whom we named Winston) that had been abandoned, we didn’t know it at the time but his eyes hadn’t even fully opened yet and we thought he was partially blind. Bumpa loved that kitten more than I have words for. Winston would start mewing from anywhere in the house and Bumpa would be there in an instant with his giant nose touching ever so lightly against Winston’s tiny one. When Winston got the courage up to venture down a long and scary hallway for the first time, Bumpa sat patiently at the end of it softly giving a little bark every time Winston faltered or started to go back to his safety zone. They slept together for years before Bumpa died and Winston spent days wandering around the house heartbroken looking for him. 

Cats and dogs can have the most beautiful friendships."
AmItheAsshole,fp6034x,t3_gb8jgy,1588343501.0,"I don’t want to say YTA because you’re clearly still grieving, but unfortunately that’s what you are in this circumstance. 

You’re projecting your feelings on to your SIL, she doesn’t have to feel the same way about her deceased child as you do about yours. You could have approached her and told her that what she said brought up negative memories and emotions for you and ask her if she could please be mindful of your feelings when discussing her family, but you don’t get to tell her what is or is not appropriate to say and feel about her stillborn child. Those are her feelings, not yours to dictate."
AskReddit,fp5z916,t1_fp5e6t9,1588343024.0,This. And I think in addition to this “your physical appearance plays an important part in a first impression” would be a hard truth addition.
Anxiety,fp5w28b,t3_gbcpep,1588341154.0,"Happens to me a lot too. I just put up with it I guess. It sucks though. 

I sent a friend a text about a week ago and no response from her yet. This behaviour is normal amongst all my friends and I know she’s probably extra busy at the moment. But that’s my logic brain. My anxiety brain is telling me that I offended her and she’s ghosting me and everyone is better off without me anyway. 

Logic brain can remind me that anxiety brain is stupid and to ignore it, but it still can’t stop me from feeling the anxiety."
