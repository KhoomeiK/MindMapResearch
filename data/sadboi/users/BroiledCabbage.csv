depression,f8r0262,t1_f8pe9bt,1574728547.0,I’ve tried CBT and got a bit out of it. Mostly I just have too many physical symptoms draining the life out of me. I upped my Prozac dose today so things are looking up. I’ll make posts like these all the time and then I’ll get one hit of serotonin®️ and I’ll be fine.

If you think you have no where to go but down then you’ll find yourself on the ground. Please take it easy if you’re okay. Stay for your fiancé if not for yourself. Let them help you see hope, because it’s always there somewhere, whether you feel it or not."

depression,f8d6ssv,t3_cml6ni,1574480004.0,If I stopped doing the work on any of my relationships they’d crumble. If I disappeared for a day no one would ask. And if I was gone for longer no one would notice a thing until they got lonely and needed an easy fix
depression,f8aize8,t3_dzv235,1574398725.0,"I’ve made a post with the exact same title strangely enough. We probably think alike. Now I’m going to tell you pretty much the same bullshit that everyone does, but maybe it’ll mean something to you. When hope runs out and you really have nothing to life for, do it as a tribute. Remember your past self by acting like them. Get up every morning that you physically can and do it for whoever you were however many years ago when you were happy. It started getting things rolling for me. Eventually after that you’re physically able to go to appointments and work through your issues. Your mind is the first step. If you don’t think you’ll be anything in life, then you won’t. But it’s not a curse, just an opportunity"
DepressionRecovery,f80qio5,t3_dybti8,1574135558.0,"If you’re allowed to be alone with your doctor during visits considering telling them. You can lie to your parents about an injury or stomach pain and convince them you need a doctor appointment. If somehow you’ve made it this far then all you need to do is ask if your doctor can help you. Be honest with your symptoms, and don’t understate anything. Your doctor may want your parents on board in the process but hearing things from a professional may really cement things in for them. That’s all I could come up with. Best of luck!"
depression,f7p1gqc,t3_dx2la6,1573939711.0,"I know that depression is horrible but you can’t get too caught up on the intellectual decline. You need to keep working on recovery if you want to have any chance of getting back mentally to where you used to be. When depressed the hippocampus (memory section of the brain) takes serious hits, although it can recover almost 100% if receive proper treatment. Just hang in there and keep moving. I’m dealing with this shit too. Sucks man"
depression,f7p12bx,t3_cml6ni,1573939424.0,"Sometimes I’ll start crying without even realizing it until my whole face starts getting irritated. Everything’s shit now. Started Prozac and not a thing has changed. I still have hope but it dies with me every time I go to sleep. The systems slow as shit. First you get the shitty meds, then you wait a month to try the better ones, then you get a dosage change and finally a year later once your whole life has been trashed can you barely breathe again. It’s not like anyone cares if I get better anyways. So if I don’t have it in me then whatever. Fuck everything. I’m out"
