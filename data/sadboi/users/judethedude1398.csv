I would wake up and not be able to sleep and only get tired at around 9 AM. The thing that saved me was seroquel. It's a type of antipsychotic medication but I take the lowest possible dose and it works like a charm. It makes me tired and able to fall asleep fast, but mostly makes me want to sleep.
