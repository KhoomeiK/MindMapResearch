Instead of giving him an answer or opinion that actually is backed up by facts or experience, then it‚Äôs these answers that takes people from merely questioning to legitimately fearful for no damn reason. This post above is WHY we have the ‚Äòpolitical climate‚Äô OP references in his post. 


The term ‚Äòmental illness‚Äô is so vague. HIPPA doesn‚Äôt allow anyone to know your medical history. If you are voluntarily or involuntarily committed you will be banned but if you‚Äôve never needed that you won‚Äôt have an issue. Getting diagnosed before you need intervention won‚Äôt stop you from owning a gun and in my opinion shows you are a responsible person to warrant inquiring about getting one if you want one. 

If there is anything else that would make mental illness a disqualifier for gun ownership is if you act weird/squirrelly when purchasing one. One might be able to remove one from you if someone calls concerned about your welfare or a threat of violence on someone else. 

Mental illness does not equal lack of constitutional rights. That‚Äôs the good and the bad of the whole issue today. The whole reason we are having this conversation is because it is difficult to prevent people who are not mentally capable of making responsible decisions with a firearm can get one easily and it‚Äôs too late before we know the person who has one shouldn‚Äôt have one. 

Edited to remove some sassiness."
