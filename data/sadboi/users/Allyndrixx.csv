 Just like misogyny. Being so forward that we're oppressing and punishing people because of their gender and not their actions is how feminism started. We want to be treated as equals. No one lording over anyone else. Judgement by the content of your character, not what is between your legs.

Usually it's ""What is your first  and last name, ma'am?"" ""Ally Smith."" ""And your first and last name, sir?"" ""Husband Smith."" That's as far as it goes.

Sure, women don't have to take a man's name. I know a lot of women in business who made a name for themselves before they married and it would be too much hassle to change their name. 

And the thing with the twins is a little out there. Unless twins run in the family, it isn't super likely. Possible, yes, but it is really sounding like he wants to do all this so he can argue with people and show them how modern and feminist he is. Most people I know don't put that much thought into it these days. Heck, most don't assume my husband and I have the same last name. They always ask. We do, but I had always planned to change my name to my husband's because I liked the symbolism. 

True feminism is about giving people to make their own choices. If I want to be girly and wear flowery dresses, I can still be a feminist. I have that choice. Just because I can break through gender norms and barriers doesn't mean I can't love my femininity. I can lead and still love flowers."
