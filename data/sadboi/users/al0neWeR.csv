I never seen a problem with Mormons just associated it another denomination until a family member had a legit mental breakdown down because of a sibling married a lady that is Mormon and somehow convinced the sibling into becoming Mormon.

I still don’t understand how it caused the family member to have that extreme of reaction to a sibling converting to a different religion.

I met this lady and she seems alright. I’ve been around her whole family and they were kind of weird and didn’t talk to me but whatever. I got the judging vibes from them.

But it’s the same around other religious people. There are some genuinely nice religious people, but a lot of the church goers play a “nice” persona with the feeling of intense judgement underlying the “nice”.

I have family members who are pastors and never got the judgement vibes from them, but I’ve been to churches where I’ve experienced it and it would be mostly by other church goers than the pastors themselves.

I think it’s kinda weird that Mormons also follow another book, but I just find it weird in the context of “ugh something else to read”.

But the response the church gave to asexuality throws me off from the churches I’ve experienced. As if you say something like “I don’t have sexual attraction”, they say it is a blessing that you don’t experience lustful thinking.

Fun thing I’ve experienced, I went to a Pentecostal church with a friend and didn’t experience judgement even though I was wearing my jeans, but they are wild in service and kinda terrifying as it was full of crying and screaming. I’m introverted in general and was concerned and confused. They had a lot of food to eat afterwards though.

-I’ve heard that in the religion that husbands will have more than one wives, is that true?

-Growing up I know some classmates that were involved in the religion and remember one wasn’t allowed to have soda. Not sure if it was religion based, but I also had a teacher say caffeine isn’t allowed.

-I know someone who swears the church is a literal cult. They told me that when they die they believe going into space and wear a white suit for their burial.

Just a general explanation please.

I grew up in a Christian based atmosphere (mostly of the Baptist denomination). It was expressed that even looking at someone with lust was adulterous. I forgot the exact verse but basically if you look with lust to gouge your eye out. So I’m sure if a email asking about asexual would give a whole different response than this.

I don’t go to church anymore. I just live life and I don’t think about religion enough to place myself in a group like agnostic or atheism. It’s not even a thought most of the time.
