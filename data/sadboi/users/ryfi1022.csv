DecidingToBeBetter,fpueaaj,t3_gf8oqr,1588910772.0,"Right now, I’m living on my college campus as a senior. That means corona my graduation that would ah w happened on the 16th. 

I have been struggling with what it means to be a first-generation and low-income scholar who is not graduating. I got extensions on all of my assignments but I have lost my motivating factors. 


I have bad adhd and anger management issues so I’m often left insecure, depressed and anxious since I have not fully completely assignments. 

I have felt horrible that I am not finishing when I should have or with any honors of some sort. I just feel like higher education doesn’t have a structure that helps me learn and I continue to get punished when I try new courses (barely passing because data science is not my thing) 

I past sexual partner has been messaging all the time trying to get back together and I blew up on him and somehow got myself roped into that for hours and now all my neighbors think I’m crazy because I was yelling and honestly blacked out 

Someone told me to trim the fat but then I need certain people in my life so how do I just get rid of them and not be alone.

I don’t know how to finish college, I don’t know how to be an adult and I don’t know how to trust the process. 

I have been trying to rebuild after my abusive relationship but I feel like I’m only becoming worse of a  person

I’m also very irritated that I have been growing and trying to implement better behavior. Yet, so many people in my life want to dangle the mistakes I’ve made in front of my face always."

I am just graduating from college, but was studying theatre and organizational studies. Since one of those is closed due to COVID-19, so I’m going through my list of interests.
