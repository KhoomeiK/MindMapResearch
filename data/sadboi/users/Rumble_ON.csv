It's a no brainer to want to be involved in novel research to advance cutting edge tech and its applications. That's what gets me pumped, and having a few boring unfulfilling engineering jobs myself (all process)  I don't see anywhere else I'd want my career to go really."
UofT,fc5h6of,t3_eg5u83,1577457486.0,"Sounds like you want an M.Eng with the ChemEng department, look into projects you can work on from the Biozone in the Wallburg building. They have a metabolic engineering lab and environmental remediation, all bioeng stuff that's unrelated to biomed.

It's not too difficult although you will need to take the engineering fundamentals catch up course. It's challenging but with a 3.7 it sounds like you'll be fine."
