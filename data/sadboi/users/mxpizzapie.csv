Of course it would be hard to have a patient not working with you but it's kind of in the job description to be able to handle confrontation.

Even my teacher from my psych 101 class at uni said that he didn't believe it was real. It's really rough to hear. Try to find a psychiatrist/therapist that specializes in trauma because they can recognize and help alters. I personally believe if you ignore those symptoms and don't focus on alters it can make it so much worse so I would disregard her advice and find a specialist If you can. Good luck

mentalhealth,erwhdah,t3_c4h0vl,1561343642.0,Maybe it's your way of processing it. Ptsd happens because at the time of the event our brains cannot process what's happening. It is stored as a different kind of memory than normal memories. This is also why flashbacks occur. When something reminds you of the event your brain tries to process it by bringing you back to the feelings and emotions of the trauma. It is normal for you to explore sexually kinky things in order to heal. EMDR and havening are 2 types of therapies that force you to remember your trauma and reprocess and overcome what has happened. It is an important step in recovery and is nothing to be ashamed of.
