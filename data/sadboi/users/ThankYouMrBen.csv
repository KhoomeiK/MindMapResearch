Absolutely NTA. You didn't undermine the teacher. Had you let the kid change her pants, then maybe you would have. You helped in many ways:

1. You removed the kid from the situation. This is helpful to the kid for reasons I probably don't need to explain to OP. It's helpful to the teacher because she could then continue the head count. *** If these were older kids, this might have been problematic - at some point, kids need to learn to stay in uncomfortable situations, but at this age it's ok.

2. You helped the child with a solution that didn't go against what the teacher said. You helped her clean it, not change.

3. You used compassion and calmness to make this a teachable moment about behaviors and consequences.

4. 3-5 year olds can sometimes have manipulative tendencies, but they're rarely sophisticated like older kids and adults can have. If this kid was hysterically worried that her parents would be mad that she spilled on her pants, it's very hard to believe she's spoiled.

I would say the one thing you possibly could have done differently is have a conversation with the teacher at the earliest convenient time to explain why you intervened, what exactly you did, and sort of ""clear the air."" 

At the end of the day, you're a school leader who was intervening in the best interest of the child. You did your job, and in my humble opinion, you handled it (almost?) perfectly."

It sounds like you're doing things right so far. Helping him to know you'll never try to replace his mom is so important, and what you're trying to do with pictures is important too. Everything about the anecdote you shared sounded to me like you handled that specific situation appropriately and compassionately.

Here's my suggestion for what ""more"" you could do. An unfortunate reality is that as he gets older, his memories of her will fade. If he's like me, he'll eventually feel a grief for the memories themselves (sadness that he realizes he's lost memory of his mom). Help him to retain them as much as possible. Find organic opportunities (when he's happy and in a good mood) to talk about his mom. Ask him to share happy memories; record his responses if you can. Ask him to draw a picture of him and her together. There will very possibly come a time when he will find value in every little artifact, item, recording, etc. that has to do with her. With all of this, keep in mind that it is totally okay if he only remembers/sees the positive parts of his mom - at least for now. (Meaning, for now, it's okay to hide her flaws from him.)

Keep sending the ""your mom is/would be (depending on your family's views/beliefs) so proud of you"" messages.

But again, it sounds like everything you're doing is what I would have hoped my stepmom would have done. These ideas are just to expand. 

It sounds like this kid is lucky to have you."
Divorce,fq6epfa,t3_ggzr5p,1589130081.0,"u/duhvorced gave an outstanding answer. I'd like to add the following. For background, my ex and I are both educators who philosophically believe kids social/emotional welfare is the most important thing. This put us in the VERY fortunate position of both having actual training on how to help kids stay emotionally well through adversity. It also meant that their emotional wellbeing was the most important thing for us as well. As far as timing goes, we're about 1.5 years past separation, and nearly a year past divorce finalization. I'm engaged to a new woman, and my ex is in a serious relationship with a new man. The kids very much like both new SOs.

With my experience as my guide, it sounds like you and your STBX have the most important part down. You're working together with respect to ensure that your kids get through this as well as they can. The fact that their emotional wellbeing is both you and your STBX's biggest concern is already a big step towards managing that as well as you can. Keep that up. Keep working together. Keep modeling in front of your kids that you respect each other. (If you have a disagreement, discuss it away from the kids.) Frequently remind the kids of several things: that you are still a team as their parents, that you both love them just as much as you always have, and nothing will ever change that, that you both want the other to be happy (so when new SOs come around, that's something for both parents to express happiness about). Never undermine the other parent in a way that the kids can see (only possible if both parents commit to truly being a team and making significant decisions together).

If you and your ex are able to consistently show your kids that the thing you care most about (and work towards the most) is that they're okay, then they most likely will be.

Oh, also therapy. Even if they're mostly doing ok. I think everyone should have a therapist, personally, so I'm a bit biased. But kids going through a parents' divorce will almost always benefit from therapy. It's a neutral adult. Even if you and your ex DO successfully co-parent, it's still good for them to have a neutral adult they can trust."

Do your insurance documents go to your parents? If so, then yes. They'll get an explanation of benefits (EOB) that shows the provider name (including a title, such as LCSW or PsyD).

A couple thoughts/options, some probably more feasible than others:

1. Pay out of pocket - no insurance documents then.

2. Have your insurance docs start coming to you.

3. Be up front with your parents that you're seeking therapy. Or, if that's easier said than done, which I suspect since you even asked this question.... If it becomes an ""issue,"" tell them you're an adult and you're taking control of your health.

There's nothing wrong with seeking therapy - in fact, it's the opposite. It's admirable. If you're at the point where you're feeling like you need it, then this is the best time to start. Go ahead and take care of yourself. You know you need it, and (you may not know, but) you deserve it."

Many people don't know that PTSD can be the result of any number of traumas, from the sexy stuff we see on tv and movies (e.g. war heroes), to a spouse having an affair, to car accidents, and injuries as a kid. It's not stupid to feel this way.

Nobody here can diagnose you if you have PTSD or not, but you're describing symptoms that very much align with people who have been diagnosed with PTSD. 

If medication and therapy *truly* are not options, then here is what I suggest, based on my own experience, and what has been most helpful for me - after my therapy and medication, of course. :)

Educate yourself as much as you possibly can with common therapies for PTSD. Look up DBT and CBT, and read about what they are and how they work. I haven't looked them up myself, but I would be EXTREMELY surprised if you couldn't find free, reliable information about how to  sort of self-ncorporate some of the therapies. To be *absolutely* clear, this is NOT a sufficient alternative to medication and therapy from a trained mental health professional. But it's something. 

I know you said ""don't mention it,"" but I just want to point some things out that you may not be aware of. And to be fair, I acknowledge that I don't know you, I don't know your situation or why therapy and medication are definitely not an option. So maybe this isn't relevant to you, but maybe someone else will see it and benefit. :)

* Medication and therapy do not always have to co-exist. For some people, therapy alone is enough. For others (but probably a lot fewer), medication alone is enough. If cost is the barrier, but it would be possible to pay for only one, it might be worth getting an eval.

* Another cost-saving suggestion: I would bet you can probably find below-average-priced therapists in early career therapists or even schools that educate future mental health professionals. These folks need a lot of clinical hours (read: putting in time learning on the job for little or no pay), which are done under the supervision of more veteran therapists. While it's possible a student (I mean, like, this is the last part of their schooling; it's not like they haven't learned anything yet) - while it's possible a student will be incompetent, the much, much more likely scenario is that you'll get a young, almost licensed therapist who has the most recent training (so most up-to-date), is extremely motivated to do well (both for their grade/license, but also because nobody goes into this for the money. If they're in this position, this is exactly what they want to do with their life), and has the expertise of a more experienced therapist at their disposal for consultation. 

* There are medication assistance plans that will help you find the cheapest pharmacy for your medication, current coupons, etc., which can greatly decrease the cost you pay, even without insurance. Many require very little work on your end. Last week, I went to pick up a prescription (for a different condition), which insurance wasn't going to cover. It wasn't that expensive (about $50), and I expected I would pay full price. When the pharmacist went to ring me up, he said ""hang on let me see if I can find a coupon to lower the price."" - He typed something into his computer, and within 20 seconds, said ""I can get the price down to $16."" - I literally didn't even ask.

TL;DR: Educate yourself as much as you can. On PTSD, on what you can do, and how you can be absolutely sure that you have as much access to resources (medication and therapy) as you possibly can under your specific circumstances. You have to be the one to look out for you."

MensLib,fhhjxpw,t3_f36j60,1581605889.0,"Two daughters, early elementary age. Ex and I separated a year ago, divorce was final in August.

This obviously is dependent on your ex being able to do this too, but I try really hard to send the message (through words and actions) to my kids that their mom and I are still a team as far as being their parents. We send that message that, yes, we don't live together anymore, but we still both love them more than anything and will always do everything we can to protect them and give them what they need. I never speak badly to them about their mom. I am super careful not to let my body language do so, as well. If they tell me something about mom that I disagree with, they don't know my feelings about it. If it's something that needs to be addressed, I do so with my ex, and they don't hear about it. I encourage them to make cards, or little gifts for mom. If they tell me something that I think their mom would appreciate, or find funny, or whatever, I encourage them to tell her.

As others have said, (and yes, age is a factor), it may not be possible to prevent all adverse effects on your kids, but you can do lots of things to mitigate it. Constantly send the message that they're loved and safe. Not all kids jump to ""this must be my fault,"" but make sure that if you see ANY sign of that, you nip it in the bud early and often.

Not to beat a dead horse that others have mentioned, but therapy. (I believe everyone should have a therapist, whether they're dealing with significant challenges or not, so this was a great time to start for the girls.)

I'll add a piece that a lot of dads don't think about when they're just starting this journey. I always thought I was a pretty good dad. Like many dads, I've always seen it as my top priority in life. I have an education background, and have the fortune of literally having graduate level coursework in child development, and I do plenty of reading and learning about how to be a good dad. It's a job I've always taken seriously. BUT, now that my divorce is done and the dust has mostly settled, I'm a MUCH better dad than I even was before. When my kids are with me (we split 50/50), I am more present, we have more fun, I'm less stressed. I'm able to do things like grocery shopping and other errands when they're not with me, so we don't have to spend our precious time together doing things like that. I've been forced to take on tasks that used to default to mom (doing hair, clothes shopping, etc.), which has strengthened the bond (note: I'm not saying those are ""mom"" jobs, that's just how they naturally fell in our house with two daughters pre-divorce). My kids have had fun and taken pride in making our new house their home.

Kids can be incredibly resilient. They need the support of the adults in their lives to be that way, but it's very possible. It is much better for kids to grow up with parents who don't live together, are happy, and are able to support and nurture them than it is to grow up with parents who live together but can only provide a dysfunctional home life."

If your parents don't, find another adult you trust. I know you're 20, and technically an adult, but 20 year-olds who don't have mental health concerns rarely have everything figured out. It's okay to seek help from others. Aunts, uncles, a friend's parents, a teacher, religious leader, etc. You deserve help and if you keep looking, you'll eventually find it.
