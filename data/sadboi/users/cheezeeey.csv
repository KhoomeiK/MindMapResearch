kpoptea,fr0foj2,t1_fr0enn9,1589793959.0,"thank you for your thoughts! all very very good points which I think are worth implementing.

def will do something in regards to the speculation about serious stuff especially as we do not want defamation/hate going around. I would be assuming if a situation is confirmed it would move to a separate post marked as news/discussion for now, until/unless I (and whoever will be the future mods) can think of a better system.

I am planning on megathreads for big situations in order to combat the influx of free for all posts. I'm trying to think of a way we can encourage more 'topic' threads so to say rather than 'opinion' threads if that makes sense.

agree also with the whole shipping/sexuality as its probably the best to keep this from becoming a shipping subreddit.

also just a yup on the word limit thing sounds like a good idea and will implement it asap!

kpophelp,fql90ao,t3_gjgsa5,1589450501.0,"Like a lot of people I got into KPOP through a friendship and BTS. I came in just before comeback promotions for Tear began and I have to say I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the production, the songs were great and through all the YT videos I ended up fully stanning. I distinctly remember the first time I clicked on the Fire MV at home thinking “Honestly... I don’t think I can fully get into Kpop its just not really my thing” :) Well.

After some forcible expansion of my music taste by my friends, one of my best friends at the time LOVED Ikon, (Love Scenario era) so I ended up stanning as well, I followed them through Killing Me, but as Goodbye road came out I ended up losing interest as their personalities never caught my attention enough to keep stanning them.

Then came Seventeen, I already knew DWC and Thanks as songs and MVs but the sheer size of the group threw me off as a baby kpop stan, way later in the year one evening I was watching some nct guide videos in order to try and stan them (as most of my friends did) and BAM I accidentally clicked on a Seventeen video and I was BLOWN away, I already thought their music/choreo was art, but upon seeing their connection and friendship with each other, the sheer chaos, I loved them, I went to listen to the rest of their discography... and in short the rest is history, now my forever ult group, could not imagine my life without them.

I stanned a couple groups in between (Ateez, TXT, Day6 & IZ*ONE namely) before one very boring day I decided I wanted to see if I could decipher a KPOP storyline, BTS was too hard and I already knew some information so I wanted to go in blind: cue LOONA.

Me: Hovering above ViViD, “I’m just here for the storyline, in fact I might not even like the songs.”
ViViD: begins playing
Me: Fuck

From there on absolutely everything about LOONA caught me, the storyline, the songs, members, dances and they are now one of my ults too :) This is getting really long now and I could talk forever on why and how I got here but sorry this is so long lol

Since LOONA I’ve stanned some more groups namely ones like Weki Meki, but I still listen and am a regular fan of A LOT of groups :)"

- Fallin Flower by Seventeen - Masterpiece, art, no words, hits the heart
- love4eva by LOONA yyxy - The upbeat music and the storyline contrast is handled amazingly, the MV is just great in how it holds your attention from end to beginning (It was also filmed in my home country lol so :))

I think you can see this a lot more in rookie groups obviously, where they still have to abide by their certain roles, to stand out from the crowd, versus more senior groups who are more trusted by the companies, and have more experience not to slip up, and oftentimes I believe act much closer to their ‘normal’ personalities."
