There is a lot you can probably only experience from playing...like the rage of your horse ragdolling away and dying in Skyrim or Red Dead. That irritation and heartbreak is felt from playing. Now you can relate from game to game of course.

But a realer world example...me liking horses irl doesn't make me an equestrian, right? But thats totally OK too."
