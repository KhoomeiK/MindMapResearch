1. Don’t put the machine under load when it is on battery, this includes heavy gaming, rendering, and compiling. Plug into a wall outlet for these activists

2. Do not let your laptops battery fully discharge, it can easily damage batteries if done routinely

3. Clean your machine like it is your car so wipe it down with things like glass cleaning cloths and alcohol. Also learn to clean cooling fans and try to do that once or twice a year or mor if you feel like it

The biggest problem with these low budget laptops is that often times they have build quality issues or flawed parts. 

The best way to avoid a bad machine is when you get it, just go through and thoroughly check the parts. You can find lists on the internet, but what you wanna do is like 

• check the hinges to see if they’re slipping or loose

• Ramp the fans up to full and listen for them to be unbalanced or scrape

• Make sure any keyboard backlighting can properly change brightness and maybe color

• Check every port to make sure that the work, plug something in and wiggle it around just a little

The list goes on, another good practice is to make a bootable USB with Rufus USB (an app) and reinstall a base version of Windows. This often helps minimize the amount of unnecessary apps or processes running which helps the cpu not stay loaded all the time. Just beware, you will have to reinstall most of all software including drivers and control center apps

Moral of the story is some people may say a laptop is objectively bad, and that’s often partially true. But if you know some of these tricks and practices, you can get the most performance out of a lot of laptops on the market"

Cyberpunk,fo32at6,t1_fo2yyqt,1587479187.0,"Tl:dr is the last paragraph

Yo I’m a backer, I’m not one of those guys with thousands of dollars invested. I just have $190 in for two ships and I’m about settled there, I’ve been backing for maybe 2 years now so I think I’ve been decently managing my money.

Anyway, my perspective of this whole debacle is the hype started way too early, like CIG came out in 2012 and said look at this great game we’re working on when it was not much more than a ship that could move on 3 axis. Which I understand because hype literally funds this development. Now everyone has heard someone question if it is a scam, and personally I think not which is obvious because I’m invested. But I do agree that there are some issues with its development.

The trio biggest problems right now are that the ridiculously inefficient server structure is run mostly on AWS computing space, and that shit is expensive. The other major issue is that new mechanics are being introduced *while* the foundation is still being bug fixed. This isn’t because the devs are inexperienced, it’s because CIG needs to keep developing new features to keep the crowd happy. 

Hopefully, with the introduction of new devs from other game studios, we’ll see the game engine get better, but it’s a lot harder to fix the cracks in the foundation than it is to add another cool room to the house on top and both jobs are unforgivably equally important because the game is crowd funded.

It comes down to this, CIG needs to add features like server meshing and other improvement on client side hosting which is its own demon, while still keeping funding coming in with new glamorous features. But no matter what, if CIG just gives up today, there is still a whole universe of radical and pioneering ideas, mechanics, and features that wouldn’t exist without CIG or without the crowds money. So that is why I still invest and hope for Star Citizen’s development"

Once you have the shade you want, mix a grey wash or very waters black then wash the mini and avoid the flat panels and spaces where the wash would pool and stain.

truegaming,fnxwjaz,t3_g49px1,1587347867.0,"Tl:dr: Stepping up Rock Paper Scissors counters with tech tiers really enhances replay ability and gameplay by weakening unit spam, and encouraging experimentation with force composition

So I know this isn’t your exact genre but personally my favorite RTSs have been the Homeworld series.

One thing I absolutely hate is when spamming one unit is the most viable strategy, like Halo Wars 2 was basically ruined by this because large groups of wolverines could be built long before a large enough counter force of either scorpions/wraiths or hunters could be built and anything else would get rekt by the thirty tiny novelty machine guns in that blob of wolverines.

So basically this goes to say that rock, paper, scissor can’t be done without some sort of enhancement. 

Enter Homeworld, it uses the idea of rock paper scissor mixed with tech tiers to allow for a lot more composition experimentation. So maybe someone opens with a fighter swarm, you have three responses: meet their fighters with your own(which only works if you are the same faction), tech up to corvettes and still swarm them, or take the time to build and research frigates to both counter the fighters and go on the offensive simultaneously. This just steps up and up until the top tier Destroyers and Battlecruisers which are the big “super units” that’ll end a game. When these guys come out the objective becomes clear as the chaos of strikes and counter strikes normally is coordinated into a final clash centered around the battle cruisers or a destroyer death ball. But those initial fighter or corvettes you made can still be an integral part of that final battle. Then there is the replay ability of building different compositions that rely on foundations like a tech rush, turtle, or brawl. In the end, Homeworld has a really good system of tech tiers and Rock Paper Scissors that encourages and rewards diversity and experimenting with composition. Too bad half of the factions are quite weak."

Basically you can get a Thinkpad for $100 on eBay and get a huge battery for it. What’s nice is these things are indestructible and really easy to repair if that is ever needed.

So what I’d recommend is look on eBay for Lenovo Thinkpad models T440p, X230, or anything else that interests you.

It might be worth it to pop over to r/Thinkpad and look around at what people have and ask a few question, personally I have an X230 if you have question about it"
