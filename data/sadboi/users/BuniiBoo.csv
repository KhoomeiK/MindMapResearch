Using mental illness as a character trait. Stop it.

relationship_advice,fnjdtt7,t3_g1w05o,1586996961.0,"When I met my BF I had a really shitty HP laptop and he had a 3K custom built desktop gaming computer. It was dope. It’s still dope. 

I’ve used and will continue to use his computer on his terms, and follow his rules. I don’t stream videos on it. I don’t download games or apps or whateverthefunk on it. I don’t even save my passwords or make bookmarks or favourites on it. It’s his. It was expensive. I respect that he paid good money for it, and with appropriate usage it will last a long time.

My HP laptop on the other hand went through hell and back, and was generally mistreated- but that was my money and my problem. That’s where I got to mess around and do the stuff I couldn’t on his desktop. I streamed. I played dumb games I found on the depths of the internet that probably gave my viruses. I did what I wanted with it because it was mine and the price tag for replacing it didn’t bother me. 

Maybe sit her down and show her what that price tag looks like. Pull up some online stores and find similar products in the same price range. Show her how much SHE will need to pony up for if she breaks or mistreats it. Tell her that if she breaks it or damages it, she will be responsible for replacing it. Show her little her shitty laptop cost in comparison. 

You shouldn’t need to do these things, and she should really just respect that this is yours and you don’t want her grubby hands on the screen (among the other, plentiful problems), but maybe she needs to see it to believe it when it comes to believing how much that cost you."

Secondly, I think you need to seek a professional to help you sort through your past trauma. The restricting and the way you use it as punishment seems more like a form of self harm, than an eating disorder, if not a combination of both. 

I don’t have any links available to me, but I’m sure another kind user can provide some. However, in the mean time, you can always try Googling therapists in your area, or even take a look at a few of the online options out there (Talkspace, BetterHelp, and 7Cups are just a few that come to mind).

Do you really want to marry someone that doesn’t feel that same as you, that considers this kind of serial cheating okay enough to repeatedly do? That isn’t as infatuated with you, as you are with them? 

I’m not even going to touch on the fact that this is a fairly new LDR. Marriage already seems asinine without that fact. 

You’re  emotional and sleep deprived. You need to exit your dynamic for half a minute to think outside of it and take a serious look at yourself, what you want, what you want out of a little, a marriage, etc. How many boxes does she check? Honestly. Be honest. 

Lastly, was someone holding a gun to her head when she sent those nudes? It’s so incredibly easy to _not_ send nudes, that I can’t believe she’s even tried to justify this.

Here here to good hugs and love!!!"
RealFurryHours,fne0rsp,t3_g120kx,1586881024.0,"Honestly, the sex positive ways of this fandom are an appeal to me. 

As a woman I was told two, very contradictory, things early on in life: sex sells and being sexy is good, and your body is allowed to be objectified to sell you products, but you’re not allowed to embrace it or the sexual desires you may have. Cover that shit up. 

Now, this may vary from person to person, but this narrative is pretty pervasive throughout our society. Thankfully, it is changing and being sex positive is becoming normal. It wasn’t always normal though, and we still have a very long way to come: for all genders and sexualities. 

I love that the furry fandom is kind of no-holds-barred in this regard. I don’t have to wonder what I’m _supposed_ to be doing, how I _should_ be dressing, or how to come off as a sensible young lady who has zero sexual desires or need for affection because I’m actually a robot in disguise, not a young woman. I am accepted in this fandom no matter what I wear, or how cuddly I am, or what I say. There’s always going to be a furry group out there ready to accept me, always with one common denominator bringing us together: we like animals.  

The furry fandom is one of the few places that has also normalized platonic touch and affection too, or is working towards normalizing it. It has always been a very affectionate and cuddly fandom, something that is not normal in our regular society as _touch_ is generally associated with _sex_ or _sexual desire_. Why? I’m not sure, men made the rules, I don’t ask questions (that’s a joke, btw). I think that as humans, we should be affectionately touching each other more, in a platonic way. There’s no reason two friends shouldn’t hold hands, or snuggle on the couch, in my opinion. It’s beneficial to our overall wellbeing and mental health, and it helps us form strong bonds. So for me this is a huge draw to the fandom. I find people in this fandom are very open to these kinds of relationships, and they actually have very little to do with engaging in sexual acts. 

As for seeing overtly sex-minded posts and pictures; I think that we see this often because those people are very active online. They’re constantly posting art, videos, photos, etc. And gaining followers and likes....Let’s go back: SEX SELLS. The furry fandom is notorious for people trying to reach their 15 minutes of fame or become a “popufur” and I believe that a lot of this activity is due to that. We have soft suiters, murrsuiters, NSFW artists, etc. It all sells. People eat it up, but people will ALWAYS eat up sex and sexy things, no matter what fandom or hobby you’re into. 

As for conventions and the orgies that supposedly take place there: who cares? Consensual sexual acts should be encouraged and I don’t really care who’s involved so long as they’re being respected and their consent is being asked. 

It is also worth noting that a lot of furries are into kink and BDSM. So, we have a group of welcoming people who like sex, especially “alternative” sex, and are allowed to talk about it and encouraged to engage in it....Of course we see it everywhere. We’re told to hide these parts of ourselves in normal, everyday life, but they’re a part of us and what makes us _us_. So when we can finally be ourselves, we go a little crazy. 

Maybe I’m out to lunch and furries are actually just lewd trash critters that need to be taught how to control their urges. I don’t know. Personally, that has not been my experience though. Remember: there’s always going to be bad people out there, it doesn’t matter what fandom or hobby you’re in. Avoid those people and find people who mesh with you and your morales."

I say things like “I’m hot and I know it” to people, or wear revealing clothes, but I actually don’t believe the things coming out of my mouth and I only think I look cute in those clothes in very limited ways. “She pretends she’s happy”- it sounds like she’s thinking these thoughts but not vocalizing them because A) she knows people will disagree with her, but she can’t see why, or B) Because she knows that she has a problem, and if she pretends to be happy she can pretend she doesn’t actually have a problem.

Counselling is likely the only thing that will help her. It seems like this is buried in a history of parental abuse and bullying and a professional will be able to give her the tools she needs to heal there first. When she’s healed that, she can heal the ED. Or maybe they heal at the same time...But I’m going to guess that her POS mother has done a lot of damage that she’s heavily internalizing. However, you cannot force her or make her want to see a counsellor. This is something she will need to decide on her own. It may take time and gentle coaxing, but do not pressure. Pressure could result in resentment and a deeper sense of “I’m doing what is right for me”, solidifying her in her ways and thoughts. 

If you talk to her about this, be very gentle. Do not accuse her of anything (Ex. “I think you have an ED”) Suggest that you’ve witnessed a very impressive transformation, but that you’re worried about her. Do not say “I think you looked beautiful at any weight, even when you were bigger,” this is not helpful. We don’t care that you love us at any weight; this isn’t about you. It’s about us. Our thoughts. Our evil, mean, persistent thoughts. You could instead say, “I’ve witnessed your body transformation, and it’s been amazing. You’re really dedicated! I am worried about the other side of this though, and would like to talk about how you’re doing mentally. Do you feel like you’ve transformed mentally too?” Ask, don’t tell. 

I can empathize with you GF. It sounds like we have similar body types (I’m this weird combination of thicc and thin, on an average height skeleton) and so she may never be able to achieve the look she wants for herself. She will need to learn how to accept her body. To see how amazing and capable it is of doing other things. I have taken to many sports and sport activities to achieve this sense of acceptance. I can be an absolute powerhouse in the gym, and I’m damned proud of that. Those thoughts, that sense of pride, can overcome the other thoughts and self loathing. 

I would caution against encouraging heavy exercise right now though, as she may end up using it as a way to lose more weight. But it is worth considering for the future. 

I wish you both the best. ED’s are hard on the people who have them, but are also hard on the people who love that person. I’m sorry for what you’re both going through and if you need I am always open to chat in PM’s. I’d be happy to talk with your GF too, if she just wants to confide in someone who might feel similarly to her! 

Best wishes OP,

XO"

I’m not in contact with the man whom I consider my first great, very fleeting, love because we’re from very different worlds and I met him on vacation. However, I am actually pretty good friends with my first girlfriend and first boyfriend. I consider them first loves too...Different experiences and situations with all three. 

But yeah, I think about them all the time! Vacation Fling Man is someone I think about in a “swoon, that was perfect” kind of way from time to time. It was just a beautiful moment in my life and I will hold it fondly in my heart forever. The two exes I see on a regular basis because we’re pals now, and I usually don’t think about our romantic pasts all that often."
RealFurryHours,fktxypz,t3_fk9sj3,1584537683.0,"I can be an incredibly anti-touch person, but also am a huge advocate for normalizing platonic touch and cuddling.

 I do not like that a lot of furries seem to take on this OWO “CUDDDDDLEEESS~~” personality online, but mostly because I think it’s overly dramatized and overly used in order to get attention and be “quirky” and “unique”.

However, in real life I’ve been to many cons (furry and non-furry related) and have very few experiences with people actually being this way “IRL”. People seem to be respectful and not as over zealous as they are online. The few times people have asked for a hug or I have asked for a hug, it’s been really nice, normal, and not weird or played up- it’s just been a hug! 

I guess the issue I have with the “OWO CUDDDLEEES” personality online, is that it always feels at the very root of it, a little sexual and attention seek-y. I don’t think that part of it needs to make it into real life. 

Cuddle friends. Hug strangers. Hold hands. But always do it with consent!"

BDSMAdvice,fjnwcbz,t1_fjmqqk7,1583515628.0,My main point was CONSENT and it does not look like OP’s consent is being respected or even acknowledged- I find that troubling.
BDSMAdvice,fjm7fdy,t3_fe2jqy,1583463351.0,"So I snooped your profile and am glad that I did. 

You have two posts shown and in both your Master has made you uncomfortable, afraid, and feeling belittled and betrayed. 

Are your sessions always like this? What are the reasons for you staying in such a disrespectful and unsatisfying relationship, if they are? 

So, you have a contract- break it if you do not feel comfortable in this relationship. This is not the only man in the world who understands kink and BDSM lifestyles. Find one who will appreciate a healthy BDSM relationship, respect you and your limits (based on your other post this is not a singular event), and will fulfill both of your needs- not just his own. Asking for support is not an unreasonable thing and I find it bewildering that you have it in your contract that you are not allowed. This does not seem healthy to me. 

BDSM has a a pretty solid motto: Safe, Sane, and Consensual. 

It doesn’t sound like your last two sessions (based on your posts) were much of either of those things. 

I am also extremely concerned at your seeming inability to recognize when you are in a situation that you need to exit and seem to refuse to use your safe word. Why is that? 

I am not trying to be a jerk, I am genuinely curious as the answer to these questions may help you resolve your problem. Asking ourselves tough questions is necessary to finding an appropriate way to move forward."
self,fjk0v6h,t3_fdupt0,1583417456.0,"I can relate to this an awful lot, and I’m sorry you feel this way. I do too. 

I used to be such an advocate for the issues I’m passionate about; climate change, equality for all, animal welfare, etc....But now, I find myself censoring the things I say and type because it just feels like a waste of time to try and make people understand why I’m so frustrated and sad. 

I don’t really know what the answer is, tbh. Mostly, I try to lead by example. And when people make fun of me (I’ve been dubbed “Greta” at my office) I try and explain why I think the way I do but, I don’t waste my energy anymore either. If someone is talking over me, or just lipping off I just stop talking and say “You’re entitled to your belief but the facts are facts and we need to change, I’m done with this conversation because you don’t actually want to talk, thanks for entertaining me” and leave it at that. 

I recycle, I’m conscious of the food I eat and where it comes from, I try and buy sustainable products, etc.

I also try and see beauty in the world and people every day to offset my feelings of dread. We’re flawed, deeply so, but also so incredibly amazing and unique. We’ve done a lot of crazy cool things, our world is still beautiful. It helps.

TrueOffMyChest,fjastc8,t3_fccxa2,1583179923.0,"I’m turning 24 this month  and my last closest friend who is my age is still living like she’s 17 and in high school. She is fully supported by her parents, has not ever held a real job for any significant amount of time, and frequently berates me for doing things she sees as “too grown up” because “we’re in our formative years”.

I’m pretty much done with it and have decided to no longer humour these ideas of hers. Speak up and be firm. People rarely expect the person they’re ganging up on to actually express themselves to them face-to-face, and even rarer do they expect you to take action. Show them you’re not interested in this type of friendship and move on. 

Some people just can’t seem to face the fact that they’re growing up and the social etiquette changes as you do. You can’t make them change, this is their comfort zone and only they can decide to leave it.

BDSMAdvice,fjarg0o,t3_fcfte3,1583179160.0,"So funny enough I actually just posted about kitten play, but as a person with a bunny fursona I find this head space (bunny) much easier to ease into...I have reasons for wanting to go kitten instead of bun for myself, but here are a few things I tend to do when wearing my bunny set:

- Randomly jump up and look alert - try and move your legs in a funny fashion. This can be a human version of a binky! Binky’s are possibly the most adorable thing a bunny can do imho
- Race around and in a circle then just stop and stare at something 
- Spook easily 
- Stomp your feet (think Thumper) 
- Be very curious! Bunnies are shy but incredibly curious critters
- Chew on shit you shouldn’t (lol)
- If you’re in an aggressive or scared mood stomp your feet and / or your hands on the ground. Growl a bit. People don’t realize but bunnies are actually pretty aggressive when they want to be- and they do growl!
- Nibble on fruits and veggies and if you’re into it, put out a little bowl of lettuce and other snacks on the ground for when you want it
- Dig at the ground 
- Make little nests and comfort spots out of pillows and blankets and burrow into them
- If your Dom/Domme picks you up, buck and wriggle and kick a bit - burrow your face into their neck and get reeeaal close once you settle (all bunnies I’ve held seem to do this)

Maybe these things don’t feel right for you, but I’ve adopted most of these mannerisms and ideas from watching and interaction with real rabbits so it might be a good idea to watch some videos on their behaviour and see what suits you! 

Best of luck from a fellow Bun / Kitten / Pet <3"

RealFurryHours,fjamiit,t1_fj8xnau,1583176405.0,"That’s the kind of idiocy I’m talking about. The comment you made was actually pretty funny and true.

It’s wrong because you Mr. RoaringFlameCat didn’t gush over the fact that he could FILL YOU TO THE BRIM WITH CUM LUBE HURRDURRRRRRR

Gross. 

I do understand fighting over colours. I commissioned a pair of ears and tail (material, real things) that I wanted to match my ‘sona. I wasn’t rude about it, but hot pink just wasn’t going to cut it for me, so I stood my ground and made sure I got what I paid for. 

The entitlement that I cannot stand is asking people to ONLY comment positivity. It’s just the culture for me."
RealFurryHours,fj8afro,t1_fj7ytwa,1583108800.0,"You make a bunch of great points, but I think after reading your post we are facing a bit of miscommunication.

This was mostly supposed to be a rant piece and not so much of a story but I could have saved myself some time and just written the story to begin with.

Anyhow, I believe we mostly agree with each other. I’m not saying let all hell break loose in the comment sections, I simply think the ultra-bubble-wrapped culture I see permeating the fandom (as these were all furry specific events and groups) is sad and unfortunate- and admittedly pretty frustrating at times."
RealFurryHours,fj7vqm0,t1_fj7ucv5,1583099342.0,"I guess I’ve always been of the opinion that if you’re posting something online, and especially in a way where you are seeking comments from the general public and not just close friends, you give up a certain level of authority over the content of those comments.

I think it is reasonable that bullying, harassment, etc. Are heavily policed but I guess I just did not view those comments as such. They were comments given by the audience in a way that was not intentionally rude or offensive. Off-colour maybe, but not truly distasteful.

The internet has never really held that age old adage in high regard and I’ve always appreciated the blunt reality that it can give. I also believe that the sentiment of “if you don’t like it just scroll past” works both ways for OP and commentator alike. 

Perhaps my original post was better suited for /rant or /offmychest but I stumbled upon this subreddit that welcomed furry specific negativity and thought, wow this is novel, I’ll post it here. Hindsight is always 20/20.

Edit: In regards to policing people on what they price things- yeah, sure, list something for 5K because you can but I think someone coming along and tastefully advising you that you might sell quicker or actually sell at all by appropriately listing your product for such and such reason is not in poor taste, and I tried to get that vibe across in my original post. These comments are not intentionally setting out to hurt OP, they’re actually doing the opposite and trying to be helpful. Many people commented that colouring in the line art might make the tattoo pop a bit better and bring it to life- not bad advice at all. It simply seems that unless your comment isn’t a generic “OH WOW” response, it’s considered unwarranted, mean, distasteful, etc.

If you think that way I’d highly suggest privatizing your accounts and creating a following of robots just for that. Asking the general masses to protect YOUR feelings is bonkers to me. That’s not our responsibility."

That’s not really the best use of my time or energy, and mostly I just roll my eyes and keep on scrolling if I disagree with something. 

I suppose the thing that fired me up and got wanting to rant / write a post was the example I used of someone getting their own line art tattoo’d rather largely on themselves. That’s their prerogative and honestly, I don’t care what you do with your body. The issue I had was that people who commented “You may have wanted to hold off until you really developed your style”, or “As your friend I think I would have tried to talk you out of this”.  These comments are not truly offensive. They’re comments made towards a photo posted in a very large group that did not have a tag asking people not to comment if it wasn’t positive only. They simply posted a photo and said “Look what I got” and people were a little taken aback. Rightfully so, everyone is going to have their own opinion- but every single comment that wasn’t “Wow, that’s GORGEOUS and I’m JEALOUS” was removed from the threat.

I find this really unfortunate and odd. Can people not withstand even a difference in tastes? And why does it wound you so when people don’t immediately jump up and shower you in compliments? (“You” being used in a very general sense here, I’m not speaking specifically of /you/). 

I can’t post a photo of the comment thread because it was all deleted before I could get back to it. I can really only describe this as best as I can. 

Hopefully, this offers some context to where I’m coming from and why I’m so turned off of these groups. It’s just a really pandering kind of culture and I don’t agree with it or like it."

Be fun, and giving and ready to share an interest in their likes. They will be much younger than you by the sounds of it, so you may find a lot of differences in taste of music, entertainment, teen culture, etc. Don’t make fun of them for it, they’re growing up in a different time than you. Some of my favourite memories are when my sister came with me to an Anime Convention. Not her thing AT ALL, but she wanted to explore my interests and spend time with me- that was such a nice thing for me at that age. 

Nurture and care for them and be concerned when you need to be concerned- but don’t push. My sister and I have not always been so close, it took time and growth on both our parts. Even now (in our twenties) she will scold me when she thinks I’ve done something wrong or silly, but she knows I’m my own person and need to make these decisions and experience life my own way.

Don’t give up OP, we are stronger than this. We can thrive and be happy and comfortable in our skin, I know that to be true."
AskDocs,fch0q22,t1_fcbmb0w,1577646080.0,"Thank you for sharing, I really appreciate it and I’m so sorry you went through that! 

How long after surgery were you back to your “normal” level of activity, and what did that look like to you? 

I work out 5 days a week, ride horses, and am generally moving a lot...I am worried about going stir crazy! Lol"
relationship_advice,fal4bcm,t1_fakej37,1576178168.0,"Ultimately, the choice is up to you but that seems like really toxic behaviour, and you should either confront it or leave to keep yourself safe and sane.  

To put it bluntly, he seems like a manipulative dick who, on top of being extremely rude to you, is also using the threat of revenge porn (disgusting in and of itself) to justify keeping risque photos of another woman. 

There are better people out there for you, I can assure you of that."
relationship_advice,fak3u15,t3_e9m51f,1576160372.0,"I think it depends...

My SO and I recently had one of the worst, nastiest fights ever and in the heat of the moment he said some very very hurtful things. He later admitted that he said them ONLY to hurt me, not because they were true...He also apologized profusely and agreed that saying hurtful things just to hurt is not a useful tool in an argument, and that sort of behaviour has no place in our relationship. 

We talked a lot and I genuinely feel he understands how toxic that was, and he is striving to better himself and how he reacts to certain situations. In any other scenario, I probably would have walked from the relationship, but I do honestly believe he is working on himself. 

Do you believe that he is truly sorry? Do you believe he’ll do it again, and if so, are you willing to put up with that kind of “dirty fighting”? I think most people would say no, but you have to decide what is right for you."

I'll keep it in mind though, thank you!"
