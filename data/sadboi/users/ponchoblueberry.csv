I did 0.5mg/kg for 2 sessions, then upped to 0.6, which I did twice, then 0.8, 1.0 for the last two sessions.  The bad feelings didn't seem too correlated with the dosage. I felt the worst after sessions 1, 4, and 5."
TherapeuticKetamine,fr1417p,t3_glygfn,1589812836.0,"I suffered from debilitating OCD too. Ketamine did not help me personally. It actually made things worse in the immediate aftermath, but later I returned to my shitty baseline. Ketamine just amplified my negative thoughts and obsessions. My exhausted brain felt like it was working harder than ever to keep up. Then I'd be so physically fatigued afterwards that I would lie in bed for the rest of the day, which made things worse because that meant I had all the time and space in the world to ruminate and obsess. Prozac + Abilify were what did the trick for me, in the end. Once Abilify was added on, I felt immensely better within 4 days."

antidepressants,fpklde9,t3_gdyxac,1588696747.0,"If you tend to obsessively Google (as I do), you might find that it seems like a lot of people complain about antidepressants! Emotional blunting, failure to work, nasty side effects, withdrawals, etc.! But keep in mind there is a selection bias going on. People are more likely to take the effort to ""warn"" others about a bad experience they had, than to make a routine note that things are going fine. Lots of people who do well on antidepressants might be too busy living their lives to post on forums. 

So don't be afraid, and give them a good try. It took three months before I noticed any difference, personally. And I'm very thankful for my meds. Side effects are manageable. I can still feel a range of emotions. I feel like the medication has restored my old self. Antidepressants *do* work for a lot of people, you just might not hear about the success stories as often."

depression,fmc09hn,t3_ftr82j,1585936488.0,"I got over bouts of depression in the past by ""faking it until I made it"". I tried it this time too, but failed. Felt like the physiological symptoms of anxiety/depression were too great, and I could not overpower them no matter how much ""faking"" or self-distraction I tried. 

Been on a few meds with varying degrees of success, now I think I see a glimmer of hope: use the meds to ease the physical symptoms, and then capitalize on those slightly good moments to distract myself. At first, the distraction seemed like I was merely pushing away my problems, letting them accumulate leading to some inevitable implosion later down the line. I'm ignoring that for now, and continuing with the strategy of distraction. The good news: I've achieved actual moments of ""normality""! They're few and fleeting, but they've shown me recovery *is* possible. 

Hang in there!"

When I’m feeling better, I get frustrated and ask myself why I couldn’t have just gotten better earlier, if it was so easy all along.
