StopSelfHarm,fmw1sva,t1_fmvzys1,1586437512.0,"No problem! And yes I agree that isolation, especially for myself as I'm usually an extrovert, has impacted the way I feel. I wish you the best too, if you feel lonely and / or need to vent, my inbox will be open. Stay safe!! :D!"
StopSelfHarm,fmvxynx,t3_fxk1c8,1586434570.0,"Whenever I get those urges, I tend to partake in a hobby that requires ' hand movements ' ( like art, video games, instruments etc. ). Even though this is a really complex issue, just know that you're not alone and if you ever need to vent, you can message me. Also, nobody is destined to be alone. You'll always have people who you can count on, I promise. :)"
StopSelfHarm,fmsjp8l,t3_fx5h4t,1586356813.0,Congrats!!!! I bet you'll hit the 6 months goal easily!!! :D

StopSelfHarm,fmpglct,t1_fmpfrpd,1586280465.0,"Yeah I totally get the feeling of people being shocked when, to me at least, the answer is pretty obvious. And I'll cover up once I go into the professional world, especially since I would like to work in the medical field, but in normal life I get some side glances as well as being ' treated as a puppy '. I guess it's just a matter of time until SH will be fully understood. Thank you for your contribution!"
