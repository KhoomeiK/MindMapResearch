Lost over 25 kg in two or three months.

I feel obligated to add, don't fucking do this, i managed to quit after, but relapsed later, and was an alcoholic for years, now i'm managing fairly well, but you don't want to be afraid of yourself for probably the rest of your life, do you...

Anyways, i was under 100 kg for the first time since I was like 16. That gave me the confidence to try running, but my diet was still garbage, so i plateaued.

After this i've got a job at a restaurant which meant i was moving non stop for 12 hours a day, but i had access to unlimited pizza, so still no weight loss.

Anyone who has access to unlimited pizza knows, that after a while you'd rather eat cockroaches, so i started eating gyros ingredients.

Got down to 90 fairly quick.

Got a better paying construction job shorty after, which meant i suddenly needed a lot more energy, got back on shitty diet, and booze. While a lot of it was muscle, i got back over 100 kg.
Started being a little bit more conscious about my diet agai, back to 90 but more lean.

Job as a software developer, back to 105 in 8 months

Picked up running and gym again back to like 92 in 4 months.

Diet is bad, but i'm working on it.

What's to learn about this:
It's easy to get discouraged when you look at how long the road is, but you don't have to cover it in one go, progress is progress, and while you may accept advice about your pace, ultimately, you can find your own and still enjoy life. Of course when you feel like you're going the wrong way, you gotta take a step back and find little things to change to get back on track.

It might seem like my jobs made it easier for me but in reality, they just helped to realize the basic principles of weight loss and health, thing is, they're everywhere, you're probably just looking for a workaround instead of trying because...

You think you have to constantly fight through it with your current mindset, and that seems too exhausting.
After the first baby steps, and sense of achievement, your emotions become an ally instead of an enemy.
Using your muscles will become a pleasure instead of effort.

Research some foods' calories, watch some youtubers, (recommending Today I've Learned, PictureFit, and AthleanX) if you need but keep in mind that ultimately your decisions while actually doing things is what makes a difference.

Takes a second to decide what you're buying: Oats or sugary cereal, vegetables or premade sauces, chips or seeds, pudding or (sugar free) yogurt, pork or chicken/turkey, soda or tea...

Takes a second to make up your mind to get up for a walk, then maybe it'll be running instead (invest in running shoes after consulting with someone who knows his shit about them). Do this a couple of times a week but... Apply the ""two minute rule"".

She was looking cute though so overall experience is around 2/10.

Then there was this time i broke my ankle while playing basketball, and for a couple of weeks, when i stood up to go take a piss, i've felt the blood pressure rising and the veins and arteries which were trying to heal pop.  Managed to avoid pissing myself every time, so still... 1/10

The worst pain i've ever felt though was in elementary school. I was this loudmouth kid who attended martial arts classes 5 times a week, see i was bullied for a year and my mom had none of that hence the classes, but it backfired, because i really wasn't afraid of a dance anymore.

So this boy 2 year older than me talked some shit, i of course reciprocated and got in his face. Well, under his face because you remember what difference 2 years makes in elementary. Still at the risk of being immodest, i probably could've taken him but never got the chance, because he went full King Leonidas on my balls. I've lost my sense of time, but i was curled up on the ground shaking for what felt like hours, (it was probably like 5-10 minutes) and the pain wasn't even only in my jewelry, i felt like i was being disemboweled, and that sensation took surprisingly long to completely fade.

No permanent damage was done, but that was an important lesson.

Needless to say, i have never initiated a fight, and always tried to talk my way out of them. Also avoided sports that involved objects flying at high velocity after a couple similar accidents.

We mostly did formworks. Pretty tough job, and the team was made up of your usual eastern european ex-criminals, junkies, that sort of people, so as you'd expect any fresh blood had to prove themselves before they were shown any respect, and even then, it was generally considered a bad idea to share anything personal, because eventually during the daily banter, someone would try to get under your skin, and the whole team would follow. It was a turn based game, and, as long as you didn't share any touchy subjects, it would end with laughing, and moving onto the next target.

The master of this game was this strongfat dude, lets call him Joseph, he usually went all out regarding your girlfriend, parents, friends, whatever... no boundaries, and calling him out on it, just meant he succeeded at getting under your skin, and boom, everyone in the brigade now knows where to tickle you.

Yeah it sounds toxic, and it was, but eventually i learned to laugh at myself, and everyone else too, so had tons of fun there, no i am not proud about it.

Anyways, one day a new guy (David) comes to work, we were doing floor insulations, meaning we had plenty of time and energy for our shenanigans.

1. David walks up to Joseph, after a short talk about how he got the job, David tells Joseph he looks trustworthy.  Anticipation intensifies, among the members of the brigade.
2. Joseph asks David how is he doing with girls, with that beautyful, friendly, almost fatherly manner everyone knows too well. Nobody says as much a word, except them, so they could hear everything clearly.
3. David proceeds to share every detail about the time this girl she dated a time or two recording him (without him knowing) with a cellphone through the window on his room while he was having sexual intercourse with his bed. Joseph somehow kept a straight face asking even more details, while the rest of the brigade quetly moved to another room, laying on the ground trying to hold back laughter, one of my ex colleagues looked like he's going to suffocate.
4. After carefully extracting every drop of information about the event, Joseph worked in silence with David for a while, trying to process what the fuck just happened. The rest of us are still laying on the ground wheezing as quetly as we can with tears in our eyes. Until Joseph starts to sing improvised songs at the top of his lungs about bed fucking.  We can finally let all the built up laughter out, one more minute and someone would've needed CPR.
5. This goes on all day for all 7 hours left of our work time. David did not come to work the next day. The owner of the company asked us if we know what happened. We told him David shared his story of his unique idea of bedtime, with Joseph of all people. Boss facepalms, doesn't say anything, drives off chuckling with reddening head.

I know, not funny, outright evil story. But look at it this way, if you ever get in the situation of living in eastern europe and having to do construction for a living, don't talk about the time you made love to stuff that aren't meant for that.
