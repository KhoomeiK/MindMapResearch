I was brought up in a family where looks were very important and I always felt inferior, although I am attractive (so I'm told). I have mild OCD, agoraphobia, severe anxiety and bipolar. Meds do help but it's still hard for me to leave the house and I feel like everyone is always staring at me and judging me.  Do what you're doing right now, take time for yourself, stay inside if that's what you need but is there a possibility that the scars may fade? 

There's always a chance you can find a plastic surgeon who can help you, too. Maybe you haven't found the right one yet. 

I was and am suicidal a lot so I understand that part. The holidays are rough too, maybe that's adding some stress. I do hope you stick around, things seem God awful right now but there's always a chance they can improve. 

Much love. ❤️"
