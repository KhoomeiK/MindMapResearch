DebateReligion,fr3s5t0,t1_fr3rgen,1589864794.0,The only think you‚Äôre doing right now is muddying the waters for yourself as it becomes harder and harder to believe that Yahweh is special.

DebateReligion,fr3rhw7,t1_fr3r8xw,1589864286.0,Well then were all the religions that influenced Judaism inspired by god? Did you play a big game by creating all those partially correct religions only to make Judaism? Your analogy doesn‚Äôt make any sense in this context.

Think about all the stuff King Josiah did away with, it was completely different back then. Judaism had temple prostitutes, fertility gods, and Yahweh was worshipped along others like Baal. There‚Äôs not much difference between Yahweh and El. It seems like you‚Äôre focusing on your religious ideology instead of actual archeology."
DebateReligion,fr3qmk0,t1_fr3q0wh,1589863641.0,Well it‚Äôs certainly not unique then. Was El Yahweh? Did Yahweh have a wife Asherah?
