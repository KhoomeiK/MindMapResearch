MakeMeSuffer,fqggt34,t1_fqgfd49,1589345896.0,"Exactly; I agree with everything you said. Very well put. Piercings and things as simple as hair styles should not be considered culturally “owned”. They are definitely not the same as a Chiefs headdress. 

There are some really hardcore people out there who will try to convince you that wearing a kimono, an African pattern shirt, a Native American necklace, or are Middle Eastern Shemagh is cultural appropriation. Often times that only happens outside of the country those things came from. 

When you travel to other countries more times than not they would like when you wear their clothes. Every time I’ve traveled around the world my hosts usually insist that I at least try on a few local items; usually followed by asking me something along the lines of, “So how do you like our style?” It brings these people lots of joy to share their culture. 

Again, like you also stated, you just have to respect every culture’s most strict and sacred beliefs. This is often times very easy to distinguish from basic cultural behavior/items. Usually the most off-limit things are ONLY worn/done/said by the political leaders or spiritual leaders. And it doesn’t hurt to ask people when you travel around what kinds of things are off limits or what’s acceptable."
MakeMeSuffer,fqgeiy6,t1_fqgayax,1589344242.0,"Exactly. Cultural appropriation is contextual in the sense that very specific things are DEFINITELY appropriation. I live in AZ and grew up with lots of Native American friends. Over the years we’ve exchanged several gifts and I’ve been gifted several native clothes/jewelry that I wear. There’s nothing wrong with wearing these items especially since they’re gifts. 

One thing that always comes to mind when discussing native American appropriation is when people wear a chief’s headdress. The reason why that’s a bit insensitive is because it’s not even all native Americans can wear those because they’re supposed to be only for the chief. Like if a culture doesn’t even wear a specific item of their own culture because it’s only supposed to be for the leader then maybe other people shouldn’t be wearing it either.

So in short terms I just think of a cultural appropriation as insensitivity to a culture. This doesn’t mean you can’t wear certain clothes or jewelry; even taking part in some of their holidays or rituals is totally OK as long As you’re welcome by the community. It really doesn’t take a lot to be welcomed by a community. You just have to be respectful."

tooktoomuch,fpz5ur5,t1_fpyki2g,1589013972.0,"Yes exactly. Please (OP) don’t be afraid to take smaller doses of shrooms. If you’ve never taken them and you’re concerned you will be frightened then I’d recommend extremely low doses of like 1/4 a gram to 1/2 a gram. I used to take eighths all the time but now I like microdosing at like .1-.2 grams (which is so low you don’t even trip visually). If you were my brother I’d recommend to start from there and work your way up .1 to .2 grams at a time until you find a dose you’re most comfortable with (which is exactly what I did for my brother). 

People might look at my comment and say, “That’s some bitch shit, start with a whole eighth.” but FUCK those people. I’ve seen people have a really bad time their first time tripping because of people like that. Never let anyone pressure you into taking more. 

Also ALWAYS REMEMBER that each time you buy Shrooms they probably have different amounts of psilocybin; simply put they will have different strength/potency. For this reason every time you buy new ones (unless the dealer you got them from says they’re the same batch/strain) start with what I said earlier; start at extremely low weight (.25-.5 grams) then move up from there. Again, if I were you I’d start at like .1 grams and just keep adding .1; but this takes many more days to figure out the right dose. I don’t mind it since I don’t really take Shrooms to trip visually anymore. I use microdosing to help my depression; which it really does help with."

Cringetopia,fp90k1z,t1_fp8yt2g,1588409686.0,"This is, again, simply not true. Depending on the state there are very different levels of discrimination.

That’s been debunked.[Here are some figures on inequality difference by state/city](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3). Also the way immigrants are treated in certain states is definitely a sign of discrimination. Also your point on how racism isn’t just against blacks but also against whites; this, regardless of race, is *still* discrimination. We are not all equal if racist people are allowed to run businesses and secretly use race as a determination for job qualification. 

I should add, the way you write seems unnecessarily aggressive to me. “If you want to go that card”, I’m not trying to pull any card here, mate. This isn’t a “GOTCHA!” moment that I’m doing; I’m just trying to talk about the fact that discrimination is real. I’m not taking sides against white people here; as I mentioned above they are also included in cases of discrimination (even though I believe white and black are terrible labels since there are groups of “white people” who hate each other and same with “black people” - Scottish+Irish v English, Sunni v Shia, Pakistani v Indian, certain neighboring tribes in Africa, Etc)."
politics,fp8zko8,t1_fp8ypzg,1588408641.0,"...I basically said exactly that but alright I’ll just rephrase myself. The MeToo movement was about believing a woman’s story enough for her to seek out the highest levels of justice without; to believe them enough to support them through their struggle all the way to the highest courts if necessary. Although you can’t destroy the reputation and credibility of the accused until such accusations are proven in court. If you think the MeToo movement meant being the judge, jury, and executioner than your version of the MeToo movement is comparable to the red scare when people were sent to prison simply because someone called them communist. Destroying someone’s life just because of an accusation is some straight dictator level mentality. I’ll repeat myself again, any allegation of sexual assault (man or women) should be believed enough to go to court."

politics,fp8yj6s,t1_fp8xvap,1588407543.0,What the fuck are you talking about? The metoo movement wasn’t about just thinking someone was guilty because of an accusation.

PublicFreakout,fotqn5d,t1_forq0yc,1588062666.0,"This “race” nonsense is not some made up victimology. It should be noted that your “woman” argument is not very solid either. 

Women who act up have for centuries been put right back down by both physical and verbal abuse. For this reason lots of women don’t want to confront a hateful person on a daily basis because they fear for their health; most women being less confident about winning a physical fight than the average man (testosterone plays a big part in that confidence). While that’s true, there are plenty of women (if not the majority) who would attack someone if they said something misogynistic.

As for your point how you assume the man just made an innocent (non racist) comment because he dressed like a Pakistani; it certainly didn’t seem like that based on his demeanor. That man seemed utterly racist. This isn’t all some liberal agenda where everything is blamed on race, tons of people are disgustingly racist (and the vast majority of people on earth have racial biases whether we disagree or not)."
PublicFreakout,fotpuo3,t1_for7mpz,1588061867.0,"Just because you’re black doesn’t mean you share the same mental anguish as every black person; or more simply not all black people react the same way to everything. Similarly in response to the comment you replied to, growing up in a racist environment doesn’t have the same effect on everyone. 

If you grew up with constant social rejection, violence, abuse, and instability you are extremely fortunate to be as strong as you are. I work in neuropsychology and have studied how stressful/abusive/neglectful environments physically shrink certain parts of the brain. This shrinking (or atrophy) in certain areas of the brain make it extremely hard (and sometimes impossible; at least with current therapies) to teach people to control stress. 

I just hope, in the future, we can empathize more with antisocial behavior like aggression. It usually doesn’t just come from nowhere and it’s often much harder than people think for these people to just “be less angry”. That being said, violence is still a crime and that should never change. What SHOULD change is how we treat violent criminals while they’re incarcerated; more therapy mainly."
PublicFreakout,fotpbgj,t1_for0inc,1588061336.0,"Here’s an edited version of a previous comment I’ve written in response to a similar point as yours. Please don’t feel like this is an attack at you or your personality, I just want to make some points that haven’t been made in this thread: 

As someone who studies neuropsychology I’d like to point out something almost everyone in this thread is not taking account for. I should add firstly that there is no excuse for violence; this is true. The problem is with most people saying, “this guy just needs more self control”. For many people this is not so easy. 

You may be thinking, “What kind of person has such a hard time? We’re all equal mentally aren’t we?” The simple fact is we aren’t all equal mentally. People who grow up in high stress environments have significant negative physical changes in the brain; most notably a strong atrophy in the hippocampus and amygdala. The effect of these area being physically smaller than other people who grew up in healthy environments make it harder to control stress as well as even making it harder to learn; to retain info. 

As to your point on “rinse and repeat” with arresting a person, I find that slightly offensive. We should be seeking new therapies during incarceration that remove the need for multiple arrests; more funding for therapies in prison. We have to show more empathy to people who grew up in such negative climates; whether it’s domestic abuse, societal rejection, racism, etc. Again, there’s no excuse for violence, but we should try a lot harder to empathize with those who have grown up in broken or even just harder lives."

PublicFreakout,fotot8c,t1_forlux3,1588060827.0,"Absolutely false. This doesn’t prove the racist right at all. Proving the racist right is showing how all ______ (in this case Pakistanis) are violent.

PublicFreakout,foto446,t1_fotcobj,1588060152.0,"As a neuropsychologist I feel where you’re coming from, but you have to realize aggression can come from an abnormality in brain development due to the environment a person grows up in. “Learning self control” is not so easy when certain areas of the brain have atrophied after years of abuse and neglect; like many minorities due to racism and social rejection. You’re making quite a condescending argument by saying, “every child has heard the sticks and stones bit”. Look into how social environments can physically alter the brain and you’ll find a bunch of studies showing how disadvantaged people can be. I’m not saying that violence should be excused but rather we should at least understand it better."
PublicFreakout,fotn2n6,t1_fotaqbm,1588059161.0,"Amen. I don’t think people understand that self control is extremely hard for some people to attain; depending on how they grew up. The majority of people here saying, “Have self control or you should be banned from society” clearly has never grown up in an abusive or broken family/community.

As a neuropsychologist these comments upset me even more. I know that negative experiences can physically change your brain structure; making it *physically* harder (and sometimes impossible) to not react with aggression. These comments saying, “just have self control” are being written by people who have no understanding of the science of the brain and how it can affect your personality and behavior

Edit: I should add if that is how the world works (specifically that people with no self control should be removed from society) then that’s like saying, “Fuck most of the veterans with PTSD and trauma to certain parts of the brain.” That’s not an ethical way to think. People thinking they’re taking the high road by saying we should take aggressive people away from society are actually promoting the active undoing of centuries of scientific therapies."

They revolutionized music forever regardless of what people think of them now. If you like lyrics and storytelling they are masters of those crafts. 

As for the reason they’re not circulating a lot now is just basic common sense; that’s how the music industry evolves over the years. New people in film/tv networks means newer music; often times the music of *that* new “music directors” era. Media is more interested in staying relevant than playing old classics. If you go back a few decades The Beatles were being played all the time in films and other media."
