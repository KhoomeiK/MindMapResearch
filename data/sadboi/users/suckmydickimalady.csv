But because they seemed “sooo nice”, people who were moderate friends couldn’t admit the person could possibly by abusive.

You have a job and can even get help from abuse shelters with food, clothing, housing, counseling, and even legal services (check into www.domesticshelters.org).  Let your mother know that as long as your brother lives with her, you will be living elsewhere in a non-toxic, healthy environment.  She can decide if she wants to continue being an enabler of his irresponsible behavior or not.  If she’s counting on you to financially support her, she will stop enabling him.  Even if she agrees to make him get a job, make her put it in writing with the stipulation that if your brother doesn’t keep his job the entire time you are there, that you will NOT financially support your mother as of the day your brother losses his full-time 40 hours per week job.  You can write it out on a piece of paper, have your mother sign & date it, you sign & date it, take a picture of it with your phone (privately afterwards so nobody knows you have a photo of it) and email the picture to an email account that only you know exists.  Because when your mother has a bad day, she will inevitably tell your brother about this “contractual agreement” & your brother will want to destroy the paperwork.  He knows exactly what he’s doing.  So prepare yourself with the armor you need to stop his games.  Good luck 💜💜💜"

If they thought this was going to bring tourists back so they could re-open their stores, they’re ridiculous!

He is deliberately using the cycle of abuse to be nasty to you, give things time to cool off, and then be sweet and honeymoon you.  This is typical abuser behavior.  They have learned that this keeps their victim under their control.  When i was in your situation i had a difficult time keeping a phone because my abuser would break my phone.  But right before i fled i was able to video my abuser beating me up and strangling me to unconsciousness.  He didn’t know my phone was set on the nightstand recording.  When i came to I realized i had recorded it all and i called the police who refused to look at the recording but made a report.  After i fled and found safety, i went directly to the judge and showed my recording and the police report which the cop lied on stating i had self inflicted wounds and every police officer who responded were fired and the police chief was forced to resign.  So keep your phone handy, when you least expect it you’ll get the evidence you need to have the opportunity to put yourself in a safe situation."
