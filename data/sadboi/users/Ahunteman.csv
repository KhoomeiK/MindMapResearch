EatingDisorders,fi1loc1,t3_f5pzhm,1582060164.0,"Talk to your therapist about the chances of you not getting custody.  Make sure your therapist knows the depth of troubles in your marriage. Remember that what you do now teaches your children how a relationship should be. Do you want this for them, later?  Quit worrying about support, he won't pay it, but is the pain worth it?  About the eating, yes, I'd say you are sliding pretty quickly into an eating disorder. But that's just my opinion.  Again, tell your therapist about what's going on with it.  Check out www.oa.org, there is a questionnaire on there that can help.  I have been where you are and am praying for you."

WomensHealth,fdg2wc3,t3_el6vqr,1578378005.0,"Definitely ALWAYS use a condom. The risk of getting an STI is too great to not.  Now, about pregnancy, I dont think it's bad not to tell every potential partner from the beginning. You're right about telling them if the relationship might get serious.  You might consider a more permanent solution, like tubal ligation, to preventing pregnancy."
