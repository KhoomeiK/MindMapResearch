depression,fbzg28z,t3_ef4960,1577245494.0,"My first Christmas in two years I haven't been locked up for, and I almost wish I was still. All my immediate family is spread out and the only family I have close in my city are very judgy and stuck up, they want nothing to do with me, I'm the blacksheep felon criminal of the family so I'm spending it alone watching YouTube and drinking till I'm not sad anymore.

Merry Christmas OP,  you always got a friend in me. There's always somebody out there that'll care, even if its a stranger you've never met before on the internet :)"
