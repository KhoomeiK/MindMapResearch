TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpnlmwp,t3_ge6eva,1588766750.0,Ugh. This was me in my late teens early 20’s. I didn’t have any self respect and kept chasing a dude that took advantage and when he didn’t want me I let it define alllll of my self worth. But looking back now I saw all the red flags and still went after the dude thinking I could change him. People usually show you exactly who they are and she knew that up front with him but still went after him. I feel bad for the kids they brought into this that had no choice and will probably always be around the bickering :(

200 calorie breakfast/
300 calories lunch/
1100 calorie dinner (that’s where I usually like to splurge)  😋

It’s weird but I try to visually imagine what I ate at the previous meal filling up my stomach.

CICO,fou1yet,t1_foov1tt,1588073851.0,Agree with this! Pick your favorite meal to use most of your “calorie allowance” on and you won’t feel like you’re depriving yourself. I do breakfast and lunch at about 300/400 calories each that way I could have up to 1000 for dinner if I wanted to (I’m at maintenance calories currently)

 Maybe ask them if I can at least do a few days a week? You can also maybe use “I feel like I can focus a little more at home” maybe with less side conversations/ distractions?"

It’d hurt to take a shower or even eat French fries because my cuticles and tips of my nails were always open sores. It took me a few tries but I stopped JUST long enough to let them heal, and got the courage to go get my nails done (first time ever and I’m 26) There were a couple times I’d go to fidget,  but there was no loose skin to pick so  instead find myself just rubbing my finger over a nail and it was soft because of the shiny finish they put on there. My boyfriend paid for me a few times after that to get them redone to prevent me from picking. I’m still fidgety and I still want to pick at loose skin if I see it but instead I’ll trim my nail or the cuticle with nail scissors so I’m not giving in to the urge to pick. I’ve also started cracking my knuckles. Which some people hate but I think it’s a new habit on its own lol."

thebachelor,fk7q9fe,t1_fk7l9z4,1583941557.0,I completely agree! Nobody seems to see this. They think she’s strong and stood her ground with her morals or whatever. Then why did she even go on this show/ I’ve heard some rumors about her wanting to get the young religious Instagram influencer following and I really think it’s true.
thebachelor,fk7dtbi,t1_fk7deo3,1583934302.0,Yeah but then why did she even come on this show? Lol her morals and standards seem above it? Girlfriend wanted clout. She knew what the show was

thebachelor,fk78msq,t1_fk6ts2s,1583930734.0,100% agree. The smug way Madi acted in return told me all I needed to know about her. And also told me there was probably a reason peters family really didn’t like her.

I feel like everything she said like “I stayed true to myself” were all these key phrases she thinks will help build her following on IG. She kept talking about her morals but kept coming back, then at the end still didn’t even seem to want to date peter? I truly think this girl is blinding people and wanted the air time and to target the young Christian demographic."
thebachelor,fk74esq,t1_fk66fxh,1583927369.0,Right! She just puts her hand over her face and keeps looking down. I really don’t think she was even into the guy as much as he was into her.
thebachelor,fk73fax,t1_fk69ckw,1583926498.0,"I was rooting for her and when he proposed it threw me off because I expected to her be more excited.

thebachelor,fk6y2f0,t1_fk6589l,1583921130.0,I have a feeling something else went down too that we aren’t seeing because she REALLY wasn’t a fan.
thebachelor,fk62x2g,t1_fk62r3d,1583892616.0,You aren’t alone. But I feel like we are in the minority and many people I discuss the show with can’t see through it. All of her talking points go back to her standing in her morals and not changing and blah blah. She really seems to be trying to create this Instagram Christian role model base.

thebachelor,fk61xvr,t1_fk61m7a,1583892072.0,Same here! Once Hannah Ann went off stage it was like everyone completely forgot how bad he hurt her and how terrible he was for stringing her along.

thebachelor,fk40lrn,t1_fk3vl3l,1583850745.0,"Same here!! All the girls I work with just keep applauding her “standards” and her standing in her faith or whatever. Nobody seems to see past her act that I discuss with in person. I just keep saying to them, then why did she even go on this show? Lol"

femalefashionadvice,fk3i5pk,t1_fk2yalb,1583834674.0,This was me. I slowly went from sweatpants to staying in my pjs till I was off for the day. I did feel it caused a big lack of structure in my schedule and made me feel kind of off. Like unmotivated and depressed (which I had already struggled with in the past) I then started getting up every morning and partially getting ready.

I ate a ton of fast food and knew I needed to lose weight but it felt like so much to take on. I just started logging everything I ate even if it was McDonald’s. I’d get a cheeseburger instead of a cheeseburger AND fries. I slowly started finding things that were worth the daily allowance of calories to me. Started realizing I could eat more if I ate better, and started eating less junk. Once I lost some I felt good getting into the gym because I had more energy. I am at a healthy weight now and working hard on lifting and trying strong. I still log what I eat during the week but don’t really worry about it too much on weekends. I do admit I have to watch that it doesn’t become obsessive but I have maintained for about 1 year now by logging at a maintenance calorie level. It’s a journey but it’s SO worth it."

In the past couple of years I’ve lost about 75 pounds. I go to the gym, I eat fairly healthy and I’m a healthy weight. I was obese before. I had bad acid reflux, no confidence, knees hurt, constantly tired.

The amount of mean comments I’ve gotten from girls at work is unreal. Saying I don’t eat, I look like a skeleton, that they wanted to shove a candy bar down my throat.. even my Italian grandmother saying I look disgusting and lost my boobs. The funny thing is nobody ever mentioned how unhealthy I was before. Being overweight is not healthy and not really enjoyable. It sucks that our society is trying to now criticize her for trying to be healthier for her kid. Those kind of comments will make her feel like she isn’t good enough at any size. It felt that way for me and really messed with my confidence. 
I hope she is able to block out the noise."
