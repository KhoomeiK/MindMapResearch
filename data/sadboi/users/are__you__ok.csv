Some days are fine, other are worse. What helps:

\- Outdoor sporting

\- Breathing exersices of Wim Hof, but on a low level, focusing breathing stomach first, then to the chest. 

\- Walking around in nature

&#x200B;

Its so distracting that it keeps me of working and I keep focusing on it. So annoying. And every time it goes away, my mind is like; Ah! Remember when you weren't breathing properly? Right, let's get that feeling back (:

Well let's hope we can control it. Stay safe and be healthy!"

\> To the admin, why do you sound rather negative / weirded out by his practice? I understand we should not believe in pseudoscience, but we can't deny the fact that Wim Hof went through years of medical research before he started spreading his message. So there is definitely a source or truth in the practice he carries out to the world and I don't think its right roasting him like this"

I have the same problem. Its going to take long to recover from this but these are my takes on it (I have a left curve):

\- Stop fapping, start having sex (straight movement instead of one hand)

\- Occasional light stretches for the underdeveloped side

\- When feeling, the left side feels very tense (like a hard muscle), so I'm massaging it every time I do PE exercises. 

\-  Look at how you are sitting (this is a theory), if its always your  right leg over the left, you are giving your veins a direction for them  to grow in, instead of growing straight.

\- Paying attention to which side your penis is hanging in your daily life. Switch it around!

Just my 2 cents based on feeling, no research. Curious what you think about it!"
