Rice also has a very high glycemic index, meaning your body turns those carbs to sugar almost as quickly as just eating sugar in the first place. Beans and lentils aren't much better, though with white rice (GI 73-77) you may as well just be eating sugar (GI 63).

If a diabetic would literally die from eating it, I'm gonna say eating it regularly would probably make me diabetic as fast as anything else high in carbs with a high GI.

I could also get into the fact that genetically certain races are better at processing carbs than others for various reasons (look up ""dutch hunger winter"" for an interesting epigentic study on a mother's diet during pregnancy effecting a child's ability to process carbs later in life) but honestly that's an awful lot to get into. Suffice to say, civilizations that have eaten mostly rice for centuries are more equipped to handle that than most people without that genetic background and prenatal environment.
