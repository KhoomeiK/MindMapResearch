I live in a mid-sized metropolitan area (approx. 1 million people) and while cost of living is lower than larger areas, 800 bucks a month in social security and 85 bucks a month just makes food a real anxiety for me. I can afford staples like rice and pasta and occasionally meat, but I cannot afford to get food weekly, which makes getting fresh produce basically impossible. Mix that with a history of starvation and you get weight gain and hormone imbalances. In the three years since losing above-poverty ecomomic security through work, I went from 180 pounds to over 300 pounds, with massive gain and losses in between.

I will say, do be careful about finding out which stereotypes are true, which are misconstrued, and which are false.

Every creation story goes from nothing to chaos to order. The prevailing story even in the same belief of people will change over time. 

One thing I think that is often missed in making this kind of mythology of fantasy is that destructive forces are just as much creators as creative forces. It doesn't take a scientific genius to understand or come up with that - only an observant person. Mountains blowing up leads to richer plant life and by extension, animal life. Considering how the world physically works and giving a more mythological explanation than what we'd consider scientific (depending on the people interacting with said myth in time and place) is quite valuable. 

Also, keep in mind that us as observers define reality by default. The fact that people can have different memories of the same event is good evidence that there doesn't need to be an absolute truth, and as such, stories change over time.

It can hint that needles were used extensively to torture the nerves. Are they similarly affected by water and showering/swimming and maybe even have problems with drowning?

&#x200B;

I personally would really REALLY ask yourself if you a) need to really write this and b) if you think you can research it well enough to pull it off in a respectable way, because you are talking about something that destroys people every day. The reason I strongly advise you not to write the scenes out explicitly, in addition to the narrative structure reasons I mention, is that if you are going to write scenes of hyperviolence, you need to know EXACTLY what you are doing, that it is as surgical as possible, from a narrative standpoint, and failing to do that AND justify why you HAVE to write it out explicitly instead of other methods, it will just be shock filler or worse. And you mentioning that it takes up more than one scene if you do have to write it out does not give me confidence that you know how to pull it off.

&#x200B;

 It's good to ask to make sure you're doing it right, but I do not get the sense you understand how this works, especially if it is not a governmental or politically-related torture. The problem with this kind of behavior, especially involving kidnappings, is that it IS a hugely sexual thing for the perpetrator, and it can't be shied away from if you really want to be realistic. Generally only people who have something political at stake take ransoms or whatever. Kidnappers intend to hurt their victim in every way their sick hearts desire and then dispose of them. If the torture is part of a larger political conflict, even if it's organized crime related, then maaaaaaaaybe you can more hint directly at it. Otherwise, I really recommend you steer clear of writing those scenes, because they get far nastier and downright disgusting that it seems you're willing to go."

writing,fcujcth,t1_fcuic1o,1577982322.0,"As for the process of publishing? It is not a linear formula in that, ""if I do x, I absolutely will get published."" It is a subjective market by the very nature of that readers are subjective, and thus publishers and agents have to be also. The things you listed will ABSOLUTELY help, but they do not guarantee success. Publishing is not a pure meritocracy. Luck in terms of timing of your story and its publication play a role. Genres and ideas fall in and out of favor. Same with tropes and characterizations and such. Keep an eye on it, but don't make it the epicenter of what you write. If you write to chase the market, it will counterintuitively be harder to make it work than if you start with something you love and see if it will fit into the market or if you'll have to shelve it for now and work on something else. If I remember correctly, the average number of manuscripts an author that gets published by a lmid-to-large publishing house is something like 4, so shelving stories is a natural part of the process. Sometimes, the story isn't ready to be told, or the audience isn't ready to have it. Beyond self-publishing, which is a whole other animal with its own complications, publishing really has no shortcuts or golden answer or solution. And, in my view, that's alright, because it fosters more creativity and artistry that way.

Hopefully that helps a bit! All of the stuff I talk about can be found on google, soundcloud podcasts (I recommend the manuscript academy podcast, personally!), youtube, and sources like publisher's marketplace."

As for your questions, keep in mind that I have not struck contracts with agents or publishers as of yet, so I cannot speak beyond the general things agents say at interviews and generally in the public discourse.

However, I can tell you that an agent charging to take queries is definitely a red flag. There are a few legitimate ones who do, usually high-profile agents who need a way to pare down queries without cutting them off entirely, but otherwise, that could be a sign of trouble. Now, if it isn't an official query but a one-on-one session with the understanding that this is for feedback, like at conferences or an online consulting service and such? That is a common practice and generally fine, but by no means required. They have limited time for it and it's a good way to make sure there is a fair compensation for their time giving you feedback as a consultant. If you do this, you have vetted the agent and like them, and they like your query and idea and such, great! Once you get the chance, send them your query as prescribed by their or their agency's guidelines, and make sure to mention having had this discussion! But again, it is not required, and really, having previously talked to them will jog thier memory and/or may result in a quicker and/or more personalized reply, even if they reflect and decide to pass it up because it doesn't catch their imagination a second time through.

The short of it is - you shouldn't be required to pay to officially query. However, paying an agent who offers consulting on queries and first pages and such can be very very helpful, but is also not by any means required. I have never heard of an agent who accepts queries in-person, though they may ask for a full manuscript if they like it enough at a conference. Queries are almost exclusively done online now, though I guess you could mail some of them if you REALLY wanted to. The meet agents events are more to get a sense of various agents tastes, ask questions about how they see the market, and, if you get the chance, to get a few minutes, like ten or fifteen, to discuss you book, maybe let them read a few pages, and get their feedback. It can be very very helpful, but it is by no means an end-all, be-all. ALWAYS RESEARCH AGENTS AND PUBLISHERS. There are many many places to see if an agent or a publisher is iffy or scammy out there, which are pretty easy google searches away. And always go with your gut. If it seem too good to be possible or seems like ""hey.... this seems wrong"", it likely is.

writing,fcu8z5k,t3_eirnrf,1577975395.0,"Let's go point-by-point.

1) Fiction? Not true. Non-fiction? Yes, there is an element of truth to it. ESPECIALLY for memoirs.

2)Again, if fiction, not true. There is a grain to it, but again, not true in it's absolute form. The market is important, but it's the agent's job to deal with that - that's why they are the middleman between a publisher and a writer. If an agent connects with your writing and is passionate about seeing you get something sold, they will work on that. Publishers are a bit more business-oriented, so it might be more true there.

3)For fiction, definitely false. A publisher may want an established author more, but both they and agents definitely want debut authors they can market to a wide audience so they buy more books. The more authors they publish that people like, the more books and movies and translation rights will be sold, and that benefits everyone. 

4)Ehhhhhhhhh. This is a half-truth. An agent and publisher wants you to be able to prove you know what you are doing with a story, hence the cover letter and all. But a genius cover letter doesn't make a publishable story. 

5)That's some prime BS. If you are not invested in your story, your audience will fall asleep. Now, if you think your story is perfect and can't be tweaked, then yeah. But again, as it's worded, it's blatantly false.

6)Yeah no. Again, agents take unsolicited queries for this very reason. They WANT unknown people. It means less marketing baggage to deal with - easier to build a brand from nothing than from complicated pre-existing marketing. 

7)Uhhhhhhhhh. The fist part is useful. Your revolutionary idea is not new to an agent, except for how you write it, and the fingerprints you leave on your work. THAT is what sells art - not formulas and algorithms. The second part is arrogant bullshit. Geniuses need to learn too. Child prodigies are rare and often fizzle out due to a lack of mental stimulation. So that's some next-level arrogance.

8)The first half is true. Writing on inspiration is a disaster to a career. You have to be able to write in a routine for a deadline. However, to not write what you like or to write something because it sells well is how you get mediocre fiction, which is worse than bad fiction. 

9)Again, not for fiction. Tens of thousands of books are published globally every day. Non-fiction, you need to be able to prove you are a credible source on your subject and have a market. But anyone can potentially publish fiction, if they put in the work, find the right agent, find the right publisher, all at the right time. It is not a certainty, but it is by no means a lost cause. Agents provide their personal connections to the industry to pitch your story on your behalf. 

10)I would call this partially true. There's a paradox, where you start on something and once you learn a bit, suddenly you are certain you are an expert. Then, as you learn more, you lose that perception until you regain confidence more in line with your skill. So yes, he is technically true, but leaving out SO much nuance that it can easily come across opposite of what he's potentially meaning. 

To put it shortly, in SOME aspects and circumstances, he may be right. But he is not telling it like it is. Not by a long shot. If you want more of an idea of how it is, listen to podcasts and interviews by authors, agents, publishers, etc. Go watch interviews. Go to seminars. See if your library has an author-in-residence program. Don't let one professor or other person dictate how you need to write or be successful.

There are a whole bunch that vary on genre, from science fiction and fantasy to historical, mystery, etc. Collections of short stories are harder to sell, even for an established author, because our market demands full-length stories or perhaps a collection of essays from someone either well-known or having really interesting things to say. So literary magazines are a good way to go. Also, by going that route, if/whenever you want to publish a longer story via an agent to a publishing house, or even independently, it doesn't hurt your credentials, especially if it is one of the major literary magazines like the New Yorker.

&#x200B;

In terms of actually submitting, make a list of your top ten, twenty, or even more sources, research their guidelines, and then just go for it. I think that unlike agents, most literary magazines do not want simultaneous submissions - as in a work submitted to multiple publishers. But again, research and make the decision yourself. Google is a fantastic resource to start, and if you have a library system in your area that has writers in residence, taking the time to either go to appropriate seminars and ask questions, or even one-on-one consultations is invaluable, in my opinion. Even so, the library may have all kinds of resources to help you further research the process."

All religious organizations should not be tax exempt, but if they can prove they in fact do not profit off their organization, they should be tax exempt like any other organization or citizen."
AskReddit,fctt12d,t3_eh10mm,1577957993.0,"Religious organizations that do not contribute a certain percentage towards the community (aka megachurches) should not be tax-exempt. Megachurches only exist because they enrich themselves off their congregation, and they preach endlessly about how their congregation doesn't pay them ""faithfully"" enough. I would know - I grew up actively in various church communities. The larger churches do not do as much for their communities as compared to smaller churches, and the leaders of megachurches get rich off of it."
AskReddit,fctsu77,t3_e5u3y8,1577957705.0,"Formerly homeless person. It is an entirely different world, and like anything, experience vary. I wouldn't wish mine on anyone else, but I genuinely was lucky to stay out of trouble. Being physically intimidating without trying and keeping my head down when I needed to and being social only when I had to really helped. Anyhow, a few things:

\-The isolating feeling is very real. There were no friends I could talk to, no family to call for help, since the only family actually capable of helping had effectively and ultimately blamed me for my problems and told me to figure it out on my own, to put it shortly and to the point. The only person I really had was myself. Everyone else would either want something from me, or were just doing their job. I couldn't depend on anybody except myself, and that really has altered my view on a lot of things on a broader scale.

\-Even upstanding people are generally pretty shitty towards homeless people. Everyone wants to shelter the homeless, but not in their neighborhood. Everyone wants to make sure they have food, but they want them to ""just get a job"" when that could not be possible for a million different reasons. Often, the ""best compliment"" I could get from people I had to explain my situation to was ""you don't look homeless, at least."" Like, come on. Do I have to shit myself and sit in it for three days to ""look homeless?"" 

\-Most of the time while out in public, I preferred being ignored. It is even more humiliating for someone to make a show of helping me out in the open where I know I'm being judged than it is to either be pulled aside or just left alone. If I needed help, I could go to the library and search up resources.

\-Homeless people are people too. They are just as judgemental about other homeless people as soccer moms at times. I got so tired of being told that I ""should be in college and making six figures"" instead of homeless, especially since I have a clean record, criminally,  that I'm pretty blunt now about what I think of what people think I should do. Even other homeless people are often closed-minded about others' and unable or unwilling to consider that maaaybe just maybe there are various reasons for someone's situation. 

\-Prison culture is a thing in the homeless community. Watch your words, don't stare, and find the balance between assertive and respectful. If you do not control your boundaries, someone else will. But if you are genuinely disrespectful, you will pay for it.

\-Violence happens. If you are not involved in any way and do not have the ability to take a violent person down, mind your own business. Some people look to scrap, but if you mind your own business, it's rare, if ever, that you are picked on.

\-If you know the homeless person on a personal level, make it clear that there are no strings attached to whatever you are giving them. Most of the time, in these circles, if something is given, then something is expected, either now, or later. I was given 20 bucks by a friend and sometimes panic, realizing I haven't paid them back yet, even though we both understand it wasn't expected to be paid back, nor even something I currently can do.

\-Even if you don't smoke, you will make friends if you have cigarettes. Learn to roll your own - in my area, Bugler and Top are the most popular. If you are homeless, you can sell the RYO's for like a quarter or 35 cents apiece or a newport for like 75c to a dollar. Homeless people are happy to buy smokes from you if they have the means, but don't hesitate to occasionally give out or share smokes with the people closest to you. We are aware that it's bad for you. We don't care, though most of us will be polite enough to not smoke right by a nonsmoker without first making sure it's okay. And if you are smoking, it's a good idea to offer a smoke or to share. 

The biggest thing is that homeless people are just like regular people. They just have little or no resources to function normally in society. They behave the way they do because homelessness is a constant traumatic event. Even though I have not been in a shelter or on the street in almost 2 years, it still greatly affects my day-to-day. I am more comfortable talking with people who understand this kind of thing as opposed to my college peers who do not know this and think nothing of complaining about their expensive phone being not the one they wanted. I don't blame them for it 0 it's just something I cannot comprehend. 

I also have no patience for people who have the mentality of poor people being mooches and needing to pull people up by their bootstraps. It took YEARS to get off of that, and months alone for me to finally apply and get food stamps. It took even longer for me to apply for disability. That mentality also made me realize how uninterested in helping the churches actually are as a whole, which made me leave it entirely. And I have cut ties with family members who, knowing I have been homeless and what all went on, have continued to push this idea that only college grads should be allowed to make a living and not you know, starve. This mindset is so out of touch that it honestly makes me question the intelligence or the capacity of said people to feel empathy."
AskReddit,fctr37x,t1_fctqy4b,1577955134.0,"As for how I adapted, I kept as hidden from attention as I possibly could until I could get an intake at a shelter. I then took full advantage and tried my best. I ended up hospitalized for bad mental illness. Round two was much the same but as I was deemed SMI (Seriously Mentally Ill) by the state, I was given more resources and had case managers working to help me get referrals to housing. I got disability on my own. I now live with a family member in another city, but plan to try to get either section 8 or public housing."
AskReddit,fctqy4b,t3_dhnvpc,1577954926.0,"My first night was cold and more depressing than anything. I didn't have anywhere to go, as shelters in my area didn't do intakes on the weekends, and as it was, there were only two shelters for men (aka actual shelters that offered resources to help remedy that, as opposed to salvation-army-type ""work programs"" that required 40+ hours of working for them for little/no pay to just not sleep in a gutter). I had eaten maybe a can of chili in the previous few days (I was officially homeless within a week of the new year) and felt like crap for having to steal food to get something to eat. It was still winter break, so I slept in some bushes and shaded areas at ASU by the memorial union to avoid being harrassed. I did not sleep much. One point at the middle of the night, a cop car drove on the sidewalk (the walks were very wide in this part of campus) a few times and even stopped on the other side of the bushes. I was sure I'd be arrested. But nope, it drove off a moment later and didn't bother me the res of the night.

I was 20 at the time."
AskReddit,fctqlmm,t3_edflca,1577954428.0,"You are.

I'm sorry, but I'm a bit biased on this. I was made homeless a second time because my adoptive parents decided to use mental illness as an excuse to not help while conveniently blaming me. The same logic applies to this. If you have the capacity to help and purposely withhold it because you morally disagree with something (not to actually do with safety) then you are a piece of shit human and REALLY need to look hard in the mirror and consider if you actually have empathy."

AskReddit,fctq5jb,t3_eijvr8,1577953800.0,"Formerly homeless in Phoenix. There are FAR more homeless people who do not panhandle than that do in my experience. Most of the people who do have given up hope of getting out. Either due to history of disability without governmental recognition (or not enough of a check to actually get a place outside of waiting for a long time to get into public housing) or criminal history preventing work. In phoenix, there were more jobs that accepted felons than one might first think, but the discrimination in that aspect is very real. Addiction is also very real. Most panhandlers I saw did some hard drugs or did hard drinking. 

&#x200B;

Besides, it's hard enough to get a good-paying job when one isn't homeless. The idea a homeless person could just magically get a job and stop being homeless without some kind of support services or intervention as if that's the norm and not the exception is, to put it bluntly, about as out of touch as the concept of giving rich people money so poor people will stop being so poor."
AskReddit,fctpsem,t3_efxlfd,1577953292.0,"Depends on the advice. Some of it comes from a good place. Some of it is to hear themselves talk. Sometimes, it stems from being untreated and/or undiagnosed. Took several bouts of homelessness, reaching out, and suicide attempts to be taken seriously by mental health professionals. I was legitimately told by a psychiatrist or nurse practitioner the first time I reached out for help that ""I was just feeling depressed because I was homeless."" Took resorting to suicide and failing at that to get any help, and took being left in a mental hospital by adoptive parents to be homeless on discharge to actually be taken seriously enough to get actual help with services, for frame of reference - and I was actively seeking help. More homeless people are people who are failed by the system than most any other demographic. Keep that in mind."
