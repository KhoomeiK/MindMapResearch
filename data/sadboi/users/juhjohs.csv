I totally feel the physical sensations of anxiety after Iâ€™ve had a cigarette now, which is definitely a big flag that Iâ€™ll remember for when I pack it in again in the next week or so. Amazing how I didnâ€™t feel the heightened heart rate before! 

Thanks man x"

socialanxiety,fbarkwe,t3_ece74j,1576685218.0,"I should also add a couple of things. 

- I also have BPD & bipolar so all emotions are greatly enhanced. 

- My mum is a compulsive liar and my dad was physically abusive to my sister. They are divorced and my mum hates him but they still spend time together and I donâ€™t know why. 

- I end up getting very, very, very angry with all of them whenever I see them. I just donâ€™t like them. And I know thatâ€™s a terrible thing to say. Iâ€™ve never said that before. If itâ€™s not me arguing with them or correcting my motherâ€™s made up stories, fathers drunken rude demands, theyâ€™re arguing with each other. 

- I was bullied by a teacher who used to get kicks (sexual) out of publicly humiliating me as a child. He used to embarrass me on purpose in class, assemblies etc. And then humiliate me and encourage the other children to make fun of me for going red. This triggered not just an anxiety of public speaking and attention but a full blown enormous phobia. 

- Iâ€™ve struggled with eating disorders and â€˜body dysmorphiaâ€™ since I was a child. I absolutely categorically hate ALL photos of myself and will just cover my face. Itâ€™s more than just disliking the attention. 

I just want to die thinking about getting married."

Interstitialcystitis,f9uh7pb,t1_f9ugre7,1575650748.0,"INTERESTING. Thank you for this - for real looking into this stuff has been just... SO confusing! 

Iâ€™ll have a look into Heparin and see what the results and reviews are like. I mean if thatâ€™s my only option while Iâ€™m there thatâ€™s what itâ€™s going to have to be.

Before treatment I had to quit my job and seeing my friends and everything. On top of the IC symptoms I was getting raging infections on a monthly basis which often ended in hospital stays with kidney infections as a result. Horrific way to live, as Iâ€™m sure a lot of you are struggling with too. 

Any recommendations for urologists to call in Los Angeles much appreciated also - and if I can support anyone struggling or looking for treatment in UK! Xx"
Interstitialcystitis,f9u87i3,t1_f9toxsx,1575646145.0,"Oh gosh yes twice a week will certainly add up. Iâ€™m so sorry to hear that itâ€™s such a struggle for you to get the treatment you need!
Great to know about the flex account, thank you for that! 

Iâ€™m trying to work out also what sort of treatment is actually available in the states - it seems that Cystistat isnâ€™t?! That blows my mind a little. 
Itâ€™s an instill of sodium hyaluronic acid which basically replaces the GAG lining - and it has changed my life totally. I mean I actually HAVE a life now.

Can anyone share their treatment suggestions / experience etc.? 

Big love x"

This is such a sad post and definitely points Iâ€™m concerned about.

$60 is at least a manageable cost I guess, I was picturing hundreds...
Do you mind if I ask what your treatment is?"

Does anyone have any recommendations of urologists to contact and what the equivalent of Cystistat is in the states?!

Itâ€™s a bit random but the technique Iâ€™ve found useful is having a pendant my mother bought me around my wrist on a chain - it has a dangling crystal and itâ€™s perfect for holding between my fingers and keeping my hand busy.

Oh and sugar free hard boiled sweets. Lots and lots of those! 

Good luck, 2 packs is a lot for the sake of being bored, I hope you find your inner strength, you can do it!!! X"

This is my first time quitting after 15 years smoking (Iâ€™m only 28...) and the hypnosis has made me actually do it. If it works or is just a good placebo, I donâ€™t know, but itâ€™s made it very easy, bearable and I genuinely donâ€™t want to smoke again.
First week smoke free in 15 years! 

Good luck, you can quit again x"
