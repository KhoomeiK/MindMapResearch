AnxietyDepression,fkwkfh8,t3_fkwhsj,1584595260.0,"Yes! I (24f) recently experienced this as well after my breakup with my boyfriend (27m) of 2 years. I went from having panic attacks at least once/twice a week and feeling like I was losing my mind to my anxiety, to feeling more mentally stable and like myself again. I never thought my relationship was the problem when I was with him. He was always supportive on helping me through those tough times. But I can't ignore the timing of my anxiety getting better after he broke up with me.. Not sure why or how.
But I'm happy for you feeling better as well!!"
glutenfree,fj2zclx,t1_fj15vnv,1582959853.0,I've (24f) have had a lot of the same progress with cutting out gluten! Right down to the psoriasis! My advice is to keep in mind what vodka you're drinking! I always stick with Tito's because I know for sure it's safe. A lot of vodkas are not gluten free! I made that mistake for a log time after going gf..

BPD,f725lr5,t1_f6ygftt,1573353958.0,Good question. I'm thinking a mix of both? I get so hyper focused on my favorite person that it can send me into a spiral. But also he didn't make me feel all that great about myself which I think took its toll over time. If that makes sense?

My ex broke up with me back in August and I was heartbroken for about a month. And then I realized that I haven't had any panic attacks or even feel that anxious in my day to day life like I did during my 2 year relationship where I was crying for ""no reason"" everyday. Never thought the relationship as part of my mental health being so bad till he was out of my life."

BPD,f3yc2xo,t3_diqc7y,1571251737.0,I often times wake up having a panic attack and sometimes crying. I'm not sure what triggers it. But you are definitely not alone in this. I'm also always looking for advice because it makes going through the day that much harder.
mentalhealth,ev8t88s,t1_ev3m4sh,1564290658.0,"Thank you so very much! Honestly it makes me feel better just knowing someone else can relate. And that you took the time to write this. 

I appreciate your support! And you're right, need to take things one step at a time and be kind to myself. I can't put myself down because of what other people have done.


Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
