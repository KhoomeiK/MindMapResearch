From the time I was able to form memories until I was about 25, I was a ravenous, uncontrolled nail biter. In fact I have several fingernails on both hands that will never grow normally. I had the bitter nail polish (I just got used to the taste eventually), I had rubber bands on my wrist to snap when I caught myself biting. Left bloody fingerprints on my school books and papers. I went through bandaids like I held stock in Band-Aid brand (in my experience tightly wrapping your fingertips is the fastest, most effective way to relieve the tenderness and sensitivity that happens when you inevitably bite your nail too short. Works great for hangnails too). I felt a lot of shame and self disgust whenever my dad would snap at me to ‚ÄúStop eating your fingers!!‚Äù It was a self-soothing behavior I carried into adulthood, but I hated it, and disliked myself for having no control over it 

I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else, but what helped me to stop was when I finally got on the correct medications to help my anxiety/depression, and found a great therapist. The nail biting stopped far more easily than I ever would‚Äôve imagined. I‚Äôm only sharing my personal experience, of course this isn‚Äôt the answer for everyone. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I haven‚Äôt ‚Äòeaten my fingers‚Äô in almost 15 years. I mean, I do it every now and then, but I never catch myself doing it without realizing, if that makes any sense. 

This wasn‚Äôt an easy fix by any means, but it worked for me, and it worked long term. Now I can look at my f-d up fingernails that grow in a weird triangle shape and sort of smile.

I know it feels like you need to focus on these complaints, and I am not saying that you shouldn‚Äôt, but you shouldn‚Äôt be getting stressed out and upset to the point where it is interfering with your daily life. (Not saying that you are, but I have seen it happen). Be sure to communicate with your treatment team. You also mentioned you have a long term therapist.

About an hour or so after reading your comments I finally started The Blade Itself. I‚Äôd purchased it a while back but wasn‚Äôt very enthused about starting it, until your remarks about the characters. Please note that I never, ever read fantasy, the only fantasy I‚Äôve ever read was the A Song of Ice and Fire series, and only because I was hooked on the Game of Thrones show.

I am almost halfway through The Blade Itself, I have been reading it in every spare moment. I stayed up most of the night. This book is so freaking good. I‚Äôm ordering the next one already so I don‚Äôt have to wait when I finish this one. I‚Äôve never read anything like this, and I honestly like it better than ASOIAF, a lot better. The characters are so complex and Glokta is probably one of the best, snarkiest, unlikeable (but weirdly very likeable) characters I‚Äôve read in a loooong time. I can‚Äôt wait to see Luthar‚Äôs development. I. Am. Hooked. I even bought the kindle version so I can use the ‚Äòx-ray‚Äô feature to keep track of all the characters and read along while I listen.

I just wanted to thank you. If not for you this book would probably still be gathering dust on my Audible bookshelf 3 years from now. 

I know I‚Äôm just a stranger on the internet, and it was I just a book recommendation, but please know I am being genuine when I say that Dude, you made my freaking day. Thank you so much

I dated nothing but useless, manipulative, lying shitheads, then I met the man I married. It took me way too long to trust that he really did care about my well being, to stop waiting for the other shoe to drop, that it wasn‚Äôt some long game he was playing. 

You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and are a caring and thoughtful person. You got this too. Cheers to you nonailshabits"
