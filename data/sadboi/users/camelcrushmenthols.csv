Families are a group effort, especially with young children.. of course adderall is alluring to keep up with the workload. Is there anyone you can reach out to for support to extend and build your family or if there is a man in the picture sounds like he needs to start pitching in! If you are serious about lowering your adderall usage you will have to lower your work load, to have help around the house, have a support system, etc.  Whatever that means for you. Before you are ready to quit you will have to cultivate an environment where quitting is managable. As well as let go of your expectation that you can be superhuman. The house gets messy.

Maybe I'm just neurotic, but the feeling of something being out of place made me deeply uncomfortable and almost hypersensitive of my body because i felt like something was wrong. I have a couple questions for you! One, did your body's joints crack all the time autonomously? I don't know if that's something I should be worried about. I am trying to be proactive and take calcium supplements and etc- but I noticed that around the same time my tmj got worse, now everything in my body cracks and pops 24/7. I'm thinking that because the muscles are tight the joints are working overtime due to the poor and locked posture? Just wondering if you experienced this as well. and what kind of regimen did you do to stimulate and penetrate these muscles?

In addition to seeing a PT, I try to maintain good posture and be aware of a tendency to tilt the head when reading or focusing. Try to pay attention to your periphery and open your eyes all the way and looking through both eyes, creating that composite, rather than looking through one eye more than the other. I didnt realize I focused with one eye more than the other until I started getting double vision and sometimes I even have depth perception problems. Do you wear glasses?

this might sound weird but strengthening your butt helps a lot with posture, and sitting comfortably because the butt is the basis for your back! working out your hamstrings and glutes and doing squats will help you maintain correct posture, as well as core exercises if you have a weak neck so that you have a strong trunk and foundation. I also do this yoga routine below and it helps a TON with my tmj and neck because I am usually holding my neck in one position and it focuses on a lot of spinal twists and elongating the neck/spine/jaw.

TMJ,fbytp7p,t3_ef6stf,1577226060.0,"I will share what works for me. However, my TMJ is a result of facial trauma, not joint dysfunction- but I have pretty much all the same symptoms so I'm not sure if it matters. But Ymmv.
Reducing stress helps a lot. the more I focus on how uncomfortable my jaw is, especially when I am alone, the less I allow it to slide into place naturally with my movements and the more ""locked"" feeling it gets, for me.
Stopping cracking my joints on my hands and toes, for some reason, reduced my pain and tension. For a while I was compulsively cracking my neck alot and THAT had the WORST outcome for my pain. 
Getting new glasses if you wear glasses. Or just getting them readjusted if they are wobbly. I realized I was straining one side of my face by always squinting because I couldnt see and when I got new glasses it helped my symptoms.
But by far. The BIGGEST thing that helps me is moving my hips. your hips are very interrelated with your jaw. if you always stand or sit with your weight distributed unevenly on one leg then it puts stress on your entire skeletal and muscular system to overcompensate on one side and underperform on the other. I stopped sitting cross legged, with my legs crossed, or with my legs tucked underneath me. 
And in a more general sense I focus on balance in my posture. I have scoliosis as well and I have a suspicion they are interrelated, in my case. One half of my body was much less toned and able to support my weight to the point I would sway or get dizzy when standing on my left side. But I have stregthened my neck muscles and lessened my TMJ pain by focusing on my entire posture and balance. 
this is just what has helped me. the hip thing was a huge realization for me. By balancing my weight as evenly as possible despite my spinal deformation I have severely limited neck,back, shoulder and jaw pain. I hopr you find what works for you :)"

quittingkratom,f9uxpt1,t3_e71ghl,1575659571.0,i think its quite unfair of you to paint this lady with such a broad brush when you yourself said you did not even take the time of day to talk to her. used correctly kratom can be great for palliative care especially for older folks.
latebloomerlesbians,f9t79k2,t3_e6r6tl,1575611189.0,"haha i relate so much to everything you put especially the ""drinking because i thought i was just nervous"" ... fueled a lot of my addictions"
TMJ,f9o9666,t1_f9nphjc,1575499154.0,i try not to lay on one side too much with my phone bc that definitely makes it worse. massages help. unfortunately this is also my most IRRITATING symptom so im not entirely sure of what advice to give you. it literally feels like i cant brearhe and see at the same time i have to do one or the other. pretty lame.
trashy,f9o3smu,t1_f9o1htd,1575495913.0,this seems like an asshole move purely because his shit sucks tho. but yeah fuck people who get paid to paint some like fuckin sunset on a wall. id rather see graff anyday. im much more impressed w graffiti writers who get up despite the risk climbing on buildings n shit vs. govt funded art school 20y/os with scaffolding and a permit. FOH
trashy,f9o2n6q,t1_f9ns6et,1575495240.0,"people have been writing and interacting with their environment for literally all of human history. its a deeply human desire to leave your mark on the world, tagging traces back to ancient civs.  some people want to leave their mark on the world joe-was-here style but..more creatively to show their artistic steez.
are humans who painted the first cave paintings also idiots, or are you just closeminded?"
TMJ,f9np8u6,t3_e633uf,1575488392.0,"YES. this probably my most annoying symptom. i cant see out of my peripheral vision on one side either, atleast not reliably. when i breathe in and out i cannot consistently focus on something upclose , it blurs in and out with my breathing so even reading is annoying sometimes. ill also get double vision where my eyes will struggle to make a composite image from both which can mess with my depth perception sometimes."
TMJ,f9m84u6,t1_f9m72qg,1575445620.0,"I know that this might not have been your intention, but this sub and what you are saying is very reassuring... For the past year or so I've thought it was all in my head (ha ha)....
That sounds very unpleasant..  I do understand the ""whooshing"" and blown out speaker feeling. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a conversation, someone will be speaking to me mid-sentence, then everything gets louder and all of a sudden its like a jumpscare or something... its startling and upsetting for sure. 
Despite all these symptoms I went to the doctor and he said my bite looked pretty OK so no help there... are there any tips you could give me that youve found useful for management ?"
TMJ,f9m6uhl,t1_f9m552h,1575443971.0,"Thanks for your response. I'm thankful I don't have much pain, but it made it a lot harder to figure out what was going on. Do your flare ups happen in times of stress for you? Also, hyperacusis, I have never heard that word but I have that too - I always attributed a lot of the symptoms to anxiety or sensory overload. ...You could say my heads messed up in more ways than one \*bud dum tss\*"
kratom,f9lrz6w,t3_e5rzj9,1575430488.0,"me neither... it was mostly a mental withdrawal for me, just had to find stuff to do to occupy my time"
StopSpeeding,f9lrlmk,t3_e5lvbg,1575430214.0,"I definitely relate to this... When I was younger I thought I was sooo fuckin cool and badass. all I wanted to do hoodrat shit with my friends from the age 14+.. i trapped n sold drugs and partied 24/7. Now I'm an adult obviously there are no ""rules"" (other than dont go to jail) and I have no authority to defy, really... no one really gives a fuck if i just sit here and do drugs, aint nobody prayin for me!! its just me and my decisions..""partying"" is a funny name for it because it isnt party at all when its just you, alone... all your friends and company have gone home because they have obligations and values and youre doing drugs alone.i wonder why in the world  thought i was cool for skipping classes when i could have gotten myself free college credit and learned something new and original and interesting and been in civilized company rather than out doing drugs in dirty run down trap houses with people who were scumbags.. i guess the novelty wears off. .. i wish i had been a little more closeminded in hindsight haha"
