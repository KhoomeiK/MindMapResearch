tulsa,focl9in,t1_fociem9,1587672667.0,So very true on everything.   Plus as a bartender we don’t have a shield between customers and us like Walmart and gas stations.  I mean this is too soon and a mess.   I hate not having direction.  I hate the people above us that do not care if we die or if we infect our families we come home to.   All a mess.
tulsa,foch2u2,t1_focgk4s,1587671256.0,I just don’t know what to do.  I’m a bartender so.  I do think it’s too early.   I mean people are still dying.
CoronavirusOklahoma,fo868bn,t3_g67vxh,1587590634.0,We are so dumb to think this is over.  So unsafe.  They don’t care if we die.

PublicFreakout,fncvy0n,t3_g0u50v,1586849059.0,Finish him.  I can’t believe he’s acting like people are not dying.  If Princess Diana we’re alive she’d be holding these people.  Not acting like this isn’t real and saying let’s turn the economy back on.  People are dying.  Alone.   Alone.  Our nurses are alone.  This is not OK.  What are you people not educating yourself on??????   Essential workers my asssssss.    No raises no help just dumb companies and commercials saying thank you.  Help these people. Help
