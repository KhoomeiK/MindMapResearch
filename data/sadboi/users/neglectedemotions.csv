There was a Vegas survivor who died in Thousand Oaks, and one of the deceased in Aurora had just left the food court at the Eaton Centre when it was shot up back in 2012. Another close call that comes to mind is that Columbine graduate who got accepted to Virginia Tech and was present on campus at both."

asktransgender,foxcqw2,t1_forq9x8,1588140103.0,"Sorry for the late reply, I completely forgot about this until now tbh ooooooooops D:

I should preface this by saying I'm not completely 100% out, I'm still in boymode at work for reasons, but everywhere else is normal me now.

I realized a while ago that for me, the lack of confidence and shame came from how I thought other people were going to perceive me. This was mostly directed at my group of friends and my family, not strangers. I had actually come out to them, and they accepted me still and were happy that I seemed happy, but I still felt a lot of shame because of what I thought their expectations of me were. I was super worried about them thinking that I was a fake or a tryhard, and I ended up gradually distancing myself from them and spending more time alone with my GF.

I had a lot of panic attacks over the past 3 years, and honestly, I didn't really do much in terms of transitioning. I kept taking HRT but I was in boymode every single day. It was horrible, I kept trying to say it wasn't, but looking back on it now, I was really just clawing at my insides trying to get out. But I kept taking HRT, and the changes kept happening, even though I couldn't see them at first.

Recently tho, I've been experimenting with some different looks, cause I've just been clawing at my insides so much as of late. And just very subtle changes, like getting my eyebrows threaded, or shaving my legs and my arms, or buying some tighter-fitting clothing. I noticed I was getting different looks from people when out in public before the quarantine. Not bad looks, just more quizzical. Even just the androgyny felt really good, so much so that I went and got my first real haircut. I got bangs for the first time, and it was right then that I actually began male-failing even when out in boymode. Turns out, being in the closet for so long while still taking HRT and then suddenly making some small changes actually meant a world of difference. And the best part is that all of these changes are easily hideable for me at work, so boymode is still an option. Hell, I can wear a hat at work with just some of my bangs peaking out, and a few of my coworkers I've worked with every single day have ""mistaken"" me for a girl.

One thing I also did was join some trans-friendly lesbian groups online. Just seeing some overall positivity towards trans lesbian women was enough of a confidence boost. I haven't done so but you may want to look into online trans groups that are in your area, and just reach out to some people near you and get to know them. I made friends with an amazing lesbian couple and they came and stayed with me and my GF for a little bit earlier this year. They did my makeup and we went out and had a blast. And yeah, I may have gotten some strange looks, but I was with some good people, and that's what mattered at that point. 

I'm not sure what your situation with your transitioning is like, but I'm a tomboy so the whole dyke/androgyny was my goal all along. I'm pretty much there actually, I just need a trach shave and then I'm all set. The androgyny would be a good stepping stone for some much bigger things though, if that's what your transitioning is about, and that's what really helped me. That, some time, and a little bit of guts to put myself out there. 

Good luck! You fucking got this"

>The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands (also known as The Gay Kingdom of the Coral Sea) was a micronation established as a symbolic political protest by a group of gay rights activists based in Australia. Declared in 2004 in response to the Australian government's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages, it was founded on Australia's external overseas Territory of the Coral Sea Islands, a group of uninhabited islets east of the Great Barrier Reef. The Kingdom was dissolved on 17 November 2017 following the decision made by the Australian people to legalize gay marriage.

>On 14 June 2004, after sailing on a ship named the Gayflower (a reference to the Mayflower), the activists raised the gay rainbow pride flag on Cato Island, and declared the Coral Sea Islands an independent gay and lesbian state.

The kingdom's website stated that tourism, fishing and philatelic sales were its only economic activities. However, swimming, reef walking, lagoon snorkelling, bird-watching, seashell-collecting, and shipwreck-exploring were all gay government-sanctioned non-economic activities."
