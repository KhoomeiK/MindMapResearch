what disgusts me even further is that they're saying ""fuck your sister, fuck your mum"" when they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. they're advocating for assault in three ways; they're advocating for the woman who hit him, they're telling each other to hit him when he did nothing to these yellow knights, and they're telling each other to assault his family. this is honestly the most disgusting way i've ever seen the pussy pass applied, ever. fuck everyone involved, except the one person that tried to stand up to this dumb fucking double standard that has been created by radical feminists."
