I never understand how other people could drink like they do and feel pretty good the next day. I finally realized that the way I felt the next day was due to my mental health. The last time I drank, I was hung over for 4 days. It wasn’t a physical hangover, it was a mental health hang over. I realized that my mental health is too important to keep drinking. 

Now that I’m sober, my mental health has gotten much better. I completed another 6 months of DBT with my therapist telling me she was 100% fine with me completely it. With all that is going on in the world right now, my depression and anxiety have gotten a bit worse but I’m able to handle it.

Having the 3 of you visit for awhile will be a good start. I would say do a minimum of 3-6 months visit with all 3 of you. Ask your son how he’s feeling after the visits. If he communicates that he’s feeling uncomfortable, don’t allow his dad to be left alone till he’s more comfortable. It’s all about what your son wants and feels comfortable with. Once he feels comfortable, telling your sons dad that he can take him for an hour or two by himself on a certain day. 

The one thing I have learned is it takes time rebuild the relationship. Granted your son is a little younger so it will be a little easier to rebuild the relationship but it will still take time. I will say that for me personally even though I am back in my sons life (I currently rent a room in his dads house. We have no romantic relationship. I am a friend renting a room.)

I never thought about passing it on to my son because it doesn’t affect my everyday life. However, I have noticed he has slight speech impediment. Nothing like I had but it’s there. When that happens, I gently correct him. 

If your kids develop a stutter, they develop a stutter. If they get teased or mocked for it, you will be the best ally for them to help because you’ve been where they are. In my opinion, it makes you a better mother.
