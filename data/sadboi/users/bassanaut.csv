spirituality,fqfze1p,t3_gikg97,1589334750.0,"I think that the body doesn't differentiate between bad habits and good habits. They are just habits. You build habits over the years and they become ingrained, like water repeatedly flowing over wax. Its going to continue flowing in those same channels. I'm going through this right now, and I think the answer is to take repeated action until a new habit forms, or an old one is broken. Find the energy of courage and strength to take action and as time passes, the mind adapts. Be like the turtle. Don't force immense change rapidly, but instead be aware of the forces working against you and try for repeated positive action"

When you click on the chest, you'll now see a little circuit dialogue. Now place down a lamp, and connect that to the power pole and chest with the same color wire. You can use this very basic circuit to make the lamp light up if the items in the chest drop under, or get above a certain quantity, by using the less than function. You can use this on a larger scale to monitor quanitities of items across your factory and set off alarms or turn on lights as a signal.
