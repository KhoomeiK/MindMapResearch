bipolar,foi9pue,t3_g7jb8f,1587781693.0,"Cyclothymic is up and down moods but not enough up and down to classify as bipolar disorder. Just not normal mood swings.
Bp2 is characterized by high enough moods to experience hypomania, an elevated mood that makes you feel really happy. May give you a higher sex drive, make you want to speed, be overly confident, not need as much sleep. You will also have depressed episodes with it and usually more/longer depressed episodes than bp1.
Bp1 is known for manic episodes which can be all that hypomania is and more. Usually causes a lot of damage to their lives, and then we crash into depression when it's over. Typically a very pendulum like level of bipolar, what goes up must come down and will go back up until you find a medication that stops it. Hypo/Mania is also characterized by rage that comes out of nowhere. 0 to 60 in half a second.
Mixed states are when you experience aspects of both mania and depression at once, for instance insane creativity but also suicidal. Absolutely exhausted but high sex drive.
Rapid cycling is characterized as having more than four mood swings in a year. Ultra rapid cycling can be more than one mood swing in even a day.

That encounter would be very emotionally driven, especially for a couple who's been together for 15 years. I would focus more on the emotions behind the actions. So say they are having angry sex: he pushed her onto the bed and said ""good girl."" It would be aggressive and likely one would be very dominant. How would she react to his orders? Would she submit or would she challenge him? And go from there. If you don't have sexual experience or aren't comfortable writing it, it's really best to just allude to what happened than write a scene that takes the reader out of the moment."

bipolar,foeb8nn,t3_g6ss9t,1587699797.0,"Okay, a lot to unpack here but I'm going to try.
First off, I have been diagnosed bipolar 1 for seven years. In 2014 I was in the place you currently are. Unstable, life falling apart, friends leaving me high and dry, not understanding my illness at all, no meds worked. Sophomore year of college triggered mine, but a bad job led to my diagnosis.
Yes, it can get better. I have been mostly stable for two years now. I had to try over 27 meds and multiple combos of them to find something that worked. Up until I achieved stability I had no idea who I was. I felt like my identity was bipolar disorder, but once it's no longer calling the shots, you come out this badass person who has grown and learned and changed sooo much. I love who I am on the other side of this battle.
You should not be thinking of suicide every day. Once you are stable it might cross your mind if you are having a really bad day, but for the most part, that will be a distant memory. Do I still have a detailed vision of how I'd do it? Yes. That shit sticks with you.
With decision making, if you are manic and you want to start a new career, buy a new car, adopt a pet, jump into a new relationship, anything big with financial, sexual, or judicial consequences, I recommend waiting 3 months before moving forward. I have made soooo many mistakes while manic. After about the 4th big one, my husband and I agreed that I could think of something I was interested in doing, but then wait to act on it for three to four months and see if I still want it. Grand majority of time I don't and that's how I know it's mania.
You can't rely on other people to not leave. In my experience, people will come and go. They may promise they can handle it, but bipolar disorder is intense and a lot of people get overwhelmed and walk away. THAT'S OKAY. You are not a lost cause if this happens. And typically the ones who are worth it will fight for you, learn about your disorder, and support you regardless. I've had people walk away when i was acting crazy and then come back once I got stable. Unstable bipolar people can be very toxic and sometimes people need to cut ties for a bit until you can get stable. But don't let it make you feel crazy or worthless if people walk away.
Truthfully the only way to get control is find your right meds combo. Bipolar disorder doesn't go away. It is a defect in your brain and you need a medication to balance your brain chemicals so you can achieve stability. Unfortunately, no one medication works for everyone. So you're going to have to try them.
Stability doesn't mean you are zonked and emotionless. You should feel decently normal, not overly happy, not tired and uninterested in life. Strive for content and optimistic.
Best of luck to you!"

bipolar,fn5ory0,t3_fzlyte,1586670917.0,"My psychiatrist told me to try CBD as opposed to actual marijuana because apparently THC can make you have manic episodes. That could be why you are rapid cycling, but I also was a rapid cycler in the beginning. It was actually ultra rapid because I would swing up and back down to suicidal within a few hours. I was experiencing mixed as well. A lot of it was due to some of the meds I was taking that weren't jiving with me. Once I came off of them, that got much better. All of this will be a learning curve, just figure out what does and doesn't destabilize you until you find the right concoction. Also, cyclothymia is mostly just elevated and lowered moods, not depression, suicidal thoughts, or hypomanic moods. If you are elevated enough to have mixed episodes, then you likely are bp2."

Months later we got back together, and then we got married a year later. Eight years later, and we are still together and have two kids. My bipolar disorder wasn't even diagnosed when he and I got married. Once I was diagnosed, I went through a year of coming on and off meds trying to find stability. It was awful and at the end of that year I ended up emotionally cheating on him in my first manic episode. We separated and once I came out of it and realized what I had done, he took me back. He has stuck by me through all of that and give more years of ups and downs because he sees my heart separate from this awful disorder that I have to deal with and he loves me in spite of it. There's a person out there who will do that for you too. He was only a couple months in when he saw my crazy side and he still chose me. Don't give up and don't stigmatize yourself.

You need a good partner who is willing to carry half or more of that burden. By about 3 months babies get much easier. But the rage returns when the child becomes about 2 or 3 and hits a defiant streak. That's been the hardest part is not yelling or overreacting. But I adore my boys and they know I love them. I've started explaining to my oldest that mommy has a disorder that can make her really angry sometimes and that I'm trying my best to not lose my temper. Pregnancy was actually the most stable I've been, both times. Postpartum can be rough, but if you remember that the first two weeks are just baby blues and usually lighten up after that, you'll do better.

Finally I physically stepped into the dark corner and placed my hands on the walls and told it to leave, then I touched the crib and all objects near the crib (including a teddy bear that mysteriously toppled over while we were talking) and I told whatever it was to leave and instantly the corner lightened by at least six shades.

Third, I do my best to be a good mom and wife when I'm stable. I carry a lot of things on my shoulders and manage our household well. So yes, I consider myself a good wife.
Fourth, the dehumanization of my husband is a mental process I can't control. It is part of the mania. If I could control and avoid mania, it wouldn't happen. I'm not proud ANY of this happens and my stable self has no desire to be my manic self. Please understand that the shift that occurs is not something voluntary. It's hard to understand that from the outside.
Fifth, I do not justify cheating in any form. I am blessed to have an understanding spouse who has forgiven me and taken me back. He knows how hard I fight to be stable and he knows I don't choose this in any capacity. But I still feel like a piece of shit for putting him through any of this.
Sixth, my husband knows everything. I let him know the various things I'm struggling with, though this was not always the case. It is a shameful thing to have these compulsions and I've never wanted to hurt him. The first time I had a manic episode I had no idea it was mania because I was only bipolar type 2 and I thought I really wanted a divorce. Even my doctor's thought it was my true feelings. Six manic episodes later, I'm much more aware. I know the steps that lead up to it like clockwork. But I still struggle to stop the progression as hard as I fight.
My point is, you can hate us. But we really don't want this either."
BipolarSOs,ffayzjg,t1_ff8gess,1579747756.0,"I've been diagnosed for 7 years almost and have been in constant counseling that same amount of time. I've had to learn a lot of self awareness and fight very hard for stability. Even with all I do, I still usually have one manic episode a year and have emotionally cheated every time. Once I come out of it I'm ashamed, disgusted, and confused. But it takes a long time of constant focus and fighting to figure this stuff out."
BipolarSOs,ff7h0ni,t3_erxlct,1579649349.0,"If I may offer a viewpoint from the other side...I have bipolar 1 and when I'm not manic, I'm an amazing wife. But when mania sets in several things happen to me that have caused me to emotionally cheat four times now. First, I lose all feelings for my husband. There's absolutely nothing I have found to stop this from happening. I have no control over it. Second, we start fighting a lot because I start noticing every single fault he has and holding it against him. I am actively working to let those go this time because they aren't important, but my feelings have still disappeared. Third, at some point I will begin craving emotional affection from someone I find attractive. I want to hear I'm pretty from someone new. It's like the craving of an addict. It becomes physically uncomfortable for me to not pursue this craving in some capacity. I will eventually begin to have panic attacks and get suicidal if I do not at least try to seek out some form of affection. With each manic episode I have been able to dial back the damage done during this phase but I have yet to be able to stop it.
I am taking my medication as prescribed, seeing my therapist regularly, seeing my psychiatrist more often, and trying to follow through with my boundaries I had set in place. It's still happening though at a very slow rate. It is incredibly hard to control manic compulsions even though we know how wrong they are and how much damage they do. I don't want to condone it, but offer the opposite perspective so maybe you can glean something helpful from it."

BipolarReddit,ewtvmys,t3_cq4c84,1565755104.0,"Hypomania/mania can cause you to fall in and out of love with people. I am married and usually when I become manic i lose feelings for my spouse and suddenly anyone who pays me attention is attractive. I become addicted to the attention. Once the mania wears off, i find them repulsive and I'm ashamed. And then i usually end up falling back into love with my spouse after some work. So that could definitely play into it, especially if you know you don't love the person and you value saying those words to someone when you really mean it."
sex,ewnr6z6,t1_ewnqnuu,1565587380.0,"It was pain with penetration, especially with semen. I tried lube and sometimes it helped a bit, but I always ended up burning for an hour afterward. It started out of nowhere for me, though I am on antidepressants and I wonder if a med change added to it? My insurance also stopped paying for Yaz and when I went ont he cheaper ""but same formula"" stuff, that's when it set in. It didn't stop until I came off the pill to try and conceive."
sex,ewnqave,t3_cp71xy,1565586430.0,"I had this and discovered when I came off my birth control pill, it cleared up. I would make baking soda douches or take baking soda baths and that helped ease the pain, but it didn't go away until I came off the hormones. I had been on birth control for years as well. The gyno just said it was yeast, no infection. They were no help at all."
