Seeing as it is Raid 0 with the phone, it does not appear as anything, as it is encrypted - My computer detected the micro SD card when using an adaptor, but same thing

When I leave the SD card in the phone and USB plug it into the laptop using some diagnostic tools, I do see my files, however, it appears that for some unknown reason the phone (and it is the phone as before this point it was not inserted into anything else) decided to do a (forgot the exact amount) 128kb partition and was only seeing that part.

I copied what I could off the SD card and tried to format the card from the computer while in the phone, but it kept failing.

Eventually, seeing as I now had my important files, I decided to give up, take my old and smaller SD card and Raid 0 that one with my phone, then transfer the files over

It's a fix, but not the one I was looking for. :-/"
