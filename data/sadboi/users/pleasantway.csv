EatingDisorders,fnecpbz,t3_g15kll,1586887008.0,"I can only speak for what's helped me. I have a drinking problem I'm in recovery for. I also have a food and sugar problem, I'll binge on anything. I've been seeing a therapist. Right away she found I have a strong pattern of invalidating my emotions, as well as trouble regulating my emotions which leads me to use and eat out of desperation to control them

I found this site which explained invalidation and gave me the first tools to change how I saw my thinking
http://eqi.org/invalid.htm

I'm also looking into how to manage my feelings when it feels like too much. Talking to another actual human helps the most, one that isnt going to give me advice right back and who will listen first, as I find I carry around a lot of shame about the addiction and also my perception that I ""should"" be able to solve it alone"

 Let's just say important lessons were learned about yarn weights discrepancy (the two green) and mindless knitting (missed half the frigging colourwork pattern). Mistakes were made. Sadness was had. Pattern is Rug by Junko Okamoto

Ended up rambling there. Am in a very fulfilling relationship now. My point is self reflection and some scary therapies helped. Best luck"

My guess is all the childhood shit - control or being controlled and resisting, expectation feelings,  pick your poison - is where the compulsion to manage those feelings began and drinking became that management. Going back, you're now right back in that same environment and if you haven't got a backup plan to manage the inevitable feelings it's going to be difficult to resist the impulse

Boundaries, exercise, and phone calls. Step outside Nd call someone you can vent to. Do 10 pushups in the bathroom to blow off steam. Step out and drive to the gas station to clear your head. Volunteer to walk the dog that needs to pee, check in the kids, ect. Try to put three things between you and picking up the drink to distract yourself and let the craving pass"

* Moved in with the love of my life
* Paid off all my credit card debt
* Learned to drive (fucking finally lol)
* Got involved with some large scale art projects that re-vamped my creativity
* Reconnected with an old friend I lost contact with and now we're the closest nerds ever
* If I make it through December (which I will) I'll have over 500 days clean and sober, and I'm not sure I'd have the above list if I hadnt taken that plunge"

DecidingToBeBetter,f0ysqe9,t3_d7aexw,1569077449.0,"1. 405 days sober
2. Graduated with honours
3. Passed all the board exams, registered in 2 jurisdictions
4. Began exercising and tracking my fitness, not using a scale and have been enjoying the look and feel of my body
5. Cut down on sugar from daily candy binges to 2x weekly (getting there)
6. Moved in with boyfriend
7. Broke unhealthy communication habits, have been speaking and clarifying what's bothering me out loud to my boyfriend rather than suppressing it
8. Began a journaling and meditation practice, while I only practice it semi regularly, I established enough of a habit that I notice how much better I feel with it which is incentive to keep me on track
9. Managed to take two 1-months breaks from work just to relax and actually enjoy it
10. Reached out to old friends, made several amends and apologies (swallowed pride,) rekindled old friendships, now I make it a point to talk to someone at least 6 days a week
11. Attend at least 2 AA meetings a week
12. Paid down credit card debt in spite of sabbaticals
13. Learning to play the guitar (I can play 4 chords now and strum pretty good lol)
14. Learning to knit, almost done a sweater
15. This is silly, but I used to not play any video games because I hate being bad at things, so I swallowed my pride and asked my bf to start me with an easy one. So we now play a little survival game together with some friends online and I've worked on my perfectionism enough that I can enjoy the game and not rage quit. We've been having lots of fun with it

I'm sure there's more but started from a pretty low place, I feel okay about it. I'm seeing some really nice results from small changes"
