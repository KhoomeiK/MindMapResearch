tokkiefeesboek,fj9oxy0,t1_fj9livi,1583155750.0,"> Het lijkt me eigenlijk dat juiste de bekrompen mensen die niet openstaan voor discussie het het hardste nodig hebben. Daarom is het blokkeren van kritische geluiden ook zo kwalijk, het leidt tot een fascistische uniformiteit. Er is alleen ruimte voor eenheidsworst-meningen binnen de eigen bubbel.

Meen je nu dat deze subreddit een voorbeeld is hiervan? Deze sub is bedoeld om plaatjes en screenshots te delen van mensen die zich ietwat simpel of extreem uitlaten op social media. De enige discussie die hier wordt aangemoedigd is of iets ""tokkie"" is. Daarbij komen soms politieke onderwerpen aan de orde en je bent welkom daar je mening over te delen mits het relevant is voor de originele post. 

Wat jij hierboven stelt vind ik erg extreem. Het enige wat hier wordt geblokkeerd zijn posts/comments die niet beamen waar het in deze subreddit om gaat: het delen van ""tokkie"" plaatjes en de discussie over of het wel tokkie is. Dat is hoe subreddits werken, het is specifiek gefilterde content voor mensen die daar naar zoeken. Politieke discussies kan je vast in andere subreddits houden zoals r/thenetherlands of je richt je eigen subreddit op. Als je het niet eens bent met deze werking dan zit je naar mijn mening niet goed op Reddit."

Providing your farm is more or less equal and once you got your Phage + lvl 6 you can start trading. If he uses his W prematurely you can spin around him, dodging it and doing damage. Predicting his W is crucial for doing damage and using your R.

IS primarily targeted EU countries with the biggest muslim communities and high tourism rates.

I'm curious to know why you specifically chose these countries for your claim, and not countries like Greece and Portugal who have visibly struggled during the economic crisis, for which the EU provided financial aid. Even France had a deficit so big the EU should have intervened according to their laws. It leads me to believe you're either naive or ignorant about these countries and that you need to read up on your neighbours. In the end you act on your beliefs."

Germany and other countries not or less well connected to the sea can trade all their goods through their ports. That is a huge advantage to them and sets them above the UK in terms of simple trade. I'd like to see how you think the UK can ""slaughter them"". Oh and if you mean in terms of war, then look up the sea battles between the Dutch and the UK.

Close all applications and check the task manager to see how much RAM you're using. Don't test too much RAM, it'll just make the test slow as you'll be testing your SSD/HDD space.

I know stresstesting isn't the most fun thing to do to your PC, but I think that's the best way to see if it's a PSU problem. Unless you become a sudden expert on voltages this is the easiest way.

I'll also explain why I don't think it's a GPU problem. I'm not an expert on that, but from my experience when a GPU gives you trouble the GPU will stop giving you video output. So you'll get a black screen, rather than a random reboot."

Don't put too much weight on your shoulders, okay? You're not responsible for his well being. Still, it's very noble of you and I'd feel the same. 

Regarding the work situation.. I'm not sure what the best way would be. It's good to stay as clear as possible with him. No subtle hints. You could try talking in private with him. Maybe ask him about how he feels in the workplace? Then when he's opened up you can tell him what you or others think and offer him help. Maybe some other coworkers want to help together with you, that'd be most effective.

The truth can be harsh but imo I'd rather have the truth and learn from it than the passive aggression all the time. I don't know what he's like though, I think you can see best if he can take it. Good luck!"

Then they would ask the kid a rather vague question about ""where"" the other doll would ""find her object"". If the kid wouldn't answer in a correct way BOOM it's autism! Because everyone with autism is bad at communicating! 

Then the ""solution"" would be to try to make these kids as ""normal"" as possible so they can pass for neurotypicals. Ugh.

Anxiety,f1b2d09,t1_f1acou7,1569320568.0,"I do have some tips that can help relax your muscles around that area! (I'm female tho, idk what to do if you're male but you can try them out)

- The best thing to do to relax your bladder muscles is to sit or lay down with your legs spread. Hang out on the couch, in your bed or if you're in public a chair with a table of some sorts so you got some privacy. You can do some breathing exercises while waiting on your muscles to let go. It usually takes me around 15 minutes to feel fully relaxed again. Learning how to relax your muscles benefits you in the long run.

- Something that really helps and that you can combine with my first tip is applying heat to the bladder area. Heat relaxes muscles so if you feel too tense and unable to spread your legs properly this helps you out. I have some heating packs lying around in the house and in my bag for this. It's mostly ideal for leaving the house or while you're away and can't find a place to chill. A bit awkward walking with something in your undies but I prefer that over the pain and tension.

- This last tip is the one I use when all else fails. It's simply taking a shower. Lots of heat and it helps relax your whole body instead of just your bladder. You can use the shower head to focus on the parts you want to relax. I use a small bucket that I can sit on in the shower so I can relax my bladder even more. I think using a bath would be the same idea! It's a great excuse to treat yourself and have the best shower or bath in a while.

This is one of the many ways our anxiety shows itself in our body. When you experience this it's a good sign to take a step back, give yourself a break and to put your anxiety in the corner (they're not allowed in your me-time). We're all strong anxiety people here, so hang in there <3"

I read an article made by someone who had a burnout herself that to heal she really had to learn to listen to her body. During a burnout your mind gets too present and starts dictating your body what to do, so it's time to make an U-turn and let your body rule your mind for now.

That means you'll probably have to rest a lot which is often perceived as laziness. I think it's a good thing to explain your extreme tiredness to your significant other and really press on the fact that you're not doing being lazy on purpose, it's all what burnout is about. Discuss your feelings and show them your appreciation for being there for you. The burnout will probably mean that they will have to work hardest in the house. Decide with them how to do household chores together and what happens when you can't do a chore. Try to make clear that what they expect of you matches what you can give. Make a schedule that fits your  and their needs!

This is what I've done with my SO so far and I'm very positive on the way we communicate. I've been with them for a while though, so I don't know how that goes for you (plus, everyone is different).

I'm now trying to hit up the Specialistic GGZ and get a more specific diagnosis plus treatment.

aspergirls,ez4fcrj,t1_ez1onh4,1567685987.0,"I think that would be a very good way to show your capabilities! You can put anything on paper, but having the a real demo proves your skills. 

Kotlin is similar to Java which is imo a really friendly language to newcomers. You can always switch between the two if you feel like one of them is more intuitive. 

When you made some Android apps and want to go bigger then you can try cross-platform apps with Xamarin. It's a lot more complicated, it feels like web development to me üòÖ the things that work well on Android won't work on iOS etc etc. It's like Chrome and Firefox. 

Good luck!"
aspergirls,eyur3bo,t3_cy8wje,1567469854.0,"Hey there, super awesome that you've decided to get into the field you've always wanted to!

Do want to warn you, the IT field can ask a lot from you. Be sure to take care of yourself and not to let them burn you out.

I have worked as a Full Stack dev for 3 years and I completed a IT Bachelor studies, these are the things I've learned:

- IT is HUGE. Scope down as much as you can and find something that really interests you. Like a framework, or a specific OS. I learned that it's best to be an expert in one thing than to be average in everything. I was way too curious and got into too much stuff. Doesn't mean you've got to limit yourself, especially not in the beginning, but try to find a thing you really love and just expand on that. 

- Coding nets you the best money but it also has one of the highest workloads. They're in high demand but it also means everyone tries to squeeze you. Set your boundaries! 

- Courses, tutorials and online certificates are fundamental but often doing ""the real thing"" is very different from what you learned. It's like the usual ""theory"" vs ""experience"". (This frustrates me a lot because computers **seem** so logical, but in the end they're still made by humans and contain a lot of illogical stuff.) My advice is this: do a course (or anything else), then think of something you could do with the info you've got and work on it. If you do a HTML course, try make a website. You'll notice you will miss CSS and JS skills and you'll want to do things that aren't by the book, which gives you room to improve! I used Pluralsight and Codecadamy (afaik a paid platform, but CodeSchool is nice too) to learn the basics and then started my own project after. 

- Google is your friend. You'll hit Stackoverflow a lot of times. Don't worry about copying other's answers, just try to learn from it. Like you, many of us copied that answer in need to make things work and learn! 

- Working with Arduino is cheap and easy and it teaches you a lot about hardware. Get some stuff from AliExpress (like a ESP8266) and build something you'd like to use yourself. I got a temperature sensor in my room with a seven-digit display, was pretty challenging to get it to work! I'm currently using a Bluetooth sensor and programming Android to create an app that controls the Arduino. You can get a lot of fun and experience this way, plus you will impress and maybe even make your friends happy if you make them something. (btw, check out MakerSpaces or FabLabs) 

- I think this is the most important piece of advice I can give you: find a company that suits you. Since you mentioned you're not here for big fat money it's worth to invest time in finding yourself a comfortable community at work. I've had a lot of clashes with colleagues and it seems I've chosen the wrong kind of company. Currently working for the goverment and it's very rule and power-based. It felt like there was a lot of unjust, like people dismissing my ideas because ""it would harm the department"" or simply because they felt humiliated. I learned that I didn't fit in this culture after a lot of shouting. (and then learned I got ASD, a few weeks ago actually)

I'm sure I can give you more advice if you have more specific questions. I could go very in-depth but let's keep it general for now! Don't feel afraid to shoot me some questions about anything, like what you need to know for specific stuff or about any of the advice above.

Veel succes met je reis! Echt goed van je dat je aan jezelf werkt en dat je gaat doen wat je leuk vind! 

EDIT: A small note on my IT Bachelor: yes, it's worth it. It's true that you can learn a lot of stuff online, but the experience the teachers will pass on to you brings you to the next level. It's similar to learning from a senior. I recommend it to anyone who wants to go in deep and wants to go beyond ""just make it work"". My bachelor was very broad but I hear a lot of bachelors have narrowed paths nowadays. Might be worth checking out if you want to, tho I can understand if you don't want to."
GetMotivated,eytgbew,t1_eyt4n3m,1567435811.0,"Not sure if I can fully agree on that. You never control the market. The things you invest in can be worthless the next day, no matter how hard you work. It's true that you can anticipate on that, but there's still luck involved."
personalfinance,eye366n,t1_eydzdky,1567028188.0,Yeah we have strict laws for paid leave. There's a minimum of days you get. I think it was 10% of the hours you work a year. Not gonna complain about that lmao.
personalfinance,eye1st6,t1_eydwh81,1567027655.0,"My company is shorthanded and they have a lot of employees without proper education. I do have one, so besides doing my job they asked me to educate 2 employees. Did tell them that would impact my other work but still got yelled at whenever I didn't do things or took a day off. Had to work more hours without pay to get everything done. My parents were about to kick me out so I did what I could to get financially stable. I did this for a year or so and then switched teams, but sadly the burnout was already a thing. 

There were a lot of workspace politics going on. I wasn't able to handle that and I made the mistakes of not saying ""no"". They suck but I suck too for not standing up to myself. First job is teaching me a valuable lesson."

personalfinance,eydn8ce,t1_eydlpof,1567021592.0,"I work as a programmer for a statistics company. I really enjoyed statistics before I took this job and wanted to do Data Science.

Sadly I'm that burned out that I can't do anything work related at the moment. Whenever I think of work I just blank out. It's like that feeling you have when you're having a test and that one question you practiced for hours comes up: you know that you know the answer, but your head feels empty.

Yeah I felt that my health is more important too. Maybe I should wait it out until I get actual therapy or someone professional and ask them what the best course of action is. The thing is. I feel like I'm overreacting. It's not like I said ""no"" and it's not like they beat me up in an alley or called me names. But I'm still *so* damn angry."
Anxiety,eyddr8a,t3_cwjz1g,1567016824.0,"Yup. Feeling that I've achieved nothing for another year and that I'm just wasting my life away feels horrible to me.

Anxiety,ex9pqmo,t1_ex9o79p,1566092543.0,"Aw thanks. That means a lot to me. Yeah I also got the ""failed"" feeling, like I didn't try enough or if I had just been able to change myself to be able to meet their demands I could have saved the situation. But it seems unhealthy to think that way.

I'm sure you didn't fail anyone. Sometimes things don't work out. That's a lesson I had to learn the hard way. This is the third team where I leave due to conflict. I had to leave my first team due to one guy thinking he owned me. In the second one everyone just got mad. It's been a ride...

No I'm not currently seeing a therapist but I'm seeing a psychologist I know personally tomorrow to get some recommendations. I feel weird for hoping to get a burnout diagnosis but when I had my arm broken just being in bed was so great. My whole body hurts. I reaaally don't want to return to work before that's fixed. My anxiety doesn't want me to see anyone but I gotta kick it out."
Anxiety,ex9nidc,t1_ex9lmpd,1566091553.0,"Working 14 hours a day? I'm so glad you got yourself out of that. I worked ~9-10 hours a day and occasionally worked at home. I snapped when I got back after long recovery of a broken arm. I've been trying to return slowly (4 hrs a day, healing bones is no joke man) but I couldn't concentrate whatsoever. My team went full on me. Calling me a slacker, saying I don't deserve my pay rate, that I should feel awful for being useless, that I should just work harder.

I explained the concentration issues and the medical advice I had been given by the doctor in the company. But they wouldn't listen and got angry at whatever I said, asked, or tried to mediate the situation. I figured I couldn't do good. So I screamed. Got my stuff and left. Cried my eyes out at my manager, who sent me home.

That's 3 days ago now. It's haunting me. I hope I can look back on this without fear. I don't regret it either, I feel like I had to, but I am terrified by what I've done.

Hehe, well look at me, using my main like a throwaway. Some of my friends know this name. I'm glad they're not on Reddit."
Anxiety,ex9kzbv,t1_ex9k7ei,1566090435.0,"Yeah that's the exact feeling and now that this happened I feel like I earned the label. The worst thing about anxiety is that I did feel good about standing up for myself, but when I got some worried messages from work I started to doubt if it was really needed (maybe it was worse in my head) and I wonder if I did it all wrong.

I love your username by the way :)"
AskReddit,ex6bjiv,t3_crgd6g,1566042819.0,"Sometimes when I talk or literally ""stick my neck out"" a muscle starts spasming so much it hurts. After a while it will stop.

I also have a lot of middle back pain, which nobody seems to know about. I've tried bettering my posture, laying down more frequently but nothing helps. It's as if I can feel my organs getting crushed by something."

depression,ewtgw8q,t1_ewtds84,1565744898.0,Don't think it will happen because I'm a coward. Thanks for your long message. I'm seeing a psychologist in a few days but I'm afraid I can't hold it until then. I'm so afraid of calling in sick to work again.
HouseMD,ewr69jo,t3_cpqmcw,1565696113.0,Hey! Seeing you're doing Computer Science right now you could try do both fields. I finished my IT education a few years ago and was doing a Data Science minor when a teacher of mine told me about it. His son actually works in a hospital analyzing medical data with his Computer Science and Machine Learning knowledge. They mostly did stuff in R and Python for as far as I can remember. It might be worth checking out if you can do jobs like that in your area! I'm sure they need tech savvy people.
