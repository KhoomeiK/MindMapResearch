depression,f5xr459,t3_dpl4bu,1572545007.0,"This is me. I have shut down so far now that I can feel my depression wake up with me. Sit beside me as I put my shoes on. It’s like this mad love for each other my depression doesn’t want to leave me. I’m comforting to her. I long for the fake me to become realistic. The perfect wife, the happy mother, the put together, picture perfect family. No one knows every time I shut the bathroom door I lose my mind and feel like my heart shatters into a million pieces. Counseling doesn’t help. Medication doesn’t help. Why can’t I just be the fake me? What’s the real definition of happiness? I don’t think I’ve ever experienced it."
