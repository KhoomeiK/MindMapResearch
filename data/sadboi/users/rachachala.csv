While it's not appropriation per se, don't forget that it's possible for people to be offensive/racist etc. to their own culture/people. While you are Jewish and are welcome to practice in your own way, you do have to be mindful that certain holidays and aspects of the culture are really sacred to some people.

That being said, I don't think you did anything that wrong and I definitely have not been a ""good Jew"". I'll always remember the words of my grandfather who once baked a totally non-kosher challah for Passover, ""Don't worry, I blessed it""."

SuicideWatch,f9m2glm,t1_f9ksxi6,1575439135.0,It's normal to be scared of big changes tho. I hope you stay strong and keep making life changes that are headed towards happiness
SuicideWatch,f9ksmnu,t1_f9ks7d4,1575407059.0,Then be the female. You're allowed to choose. It won't change your body but there are ways. I think you should check out [https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/) there are definitely people better suited to give advice!
SuicideWatch,f9krwqe,t1_f9i6q6r,1575406641.0,"I'm a cis female so I don't know what that's like and I'm sorry you're going through this. But if you're want to look less like a guy, that doesn't equate to beauty. There are billions of women who think they're disgusting too. I know it's not the same, but maybe to improve your image problems you should decide if it's only femininity you're chasing or beauty. It's different. There are ""ugly"" girls. Doesn't mean they're not worthwhile people or that they aren't attractive in anyone's eyes. **A lot** of people don't fit into society's standards of beauty."

If I were you, I'd try and get by so I could write that book. Get my thoughts down. So that my thoughts, my stories - they aren't just gone. Even if it isn't good, write it."
SuicideWatch,f9i6k3n,t1_f9hzfof,1575329488.0,"So? I have no way of knowing if that's true, but does it really matter? Yes - everyone wants to be beautiful. And it's so easy to be jealous of the gorgeous or pretty or just average people we see every day. But why tf is our beauty so important to our value. Fuck that. Better your mind, hone your skills, do better in school, find a hobby - and fuck mirrors."
SuicideWatch,f9i6bfr,t3_e54c94,1575329321.0,"My makeup always looks like shit. I think I have an expectation that I can erase what I hate about my face but that's not possible, especially for those of us that suck at makeup! Try getting someone else to do it who knows what they're doing and you might be pleasantly surprised. Sephora offers free 10 min makeovers, maybe try that?"
SuicideWatch,f9i5tsu,t1_f9i4w0u,1575328982.0,Can I ask what your symptoms are?
SuicideWatch,f9i548t,t1_f9i4w0u,1575328489.0,This isn't about them. This is about you. Please call 911 - trust me they only care about helping you
SuicideWatch,f9i4ss7,t3_e57ars,1575328270.0,"If you need help, call someone. Call 911 or what you're scared of could happen"
SuicideWatch,f9i4dq2,t3_e4vvro,1575327980.0,"I've found that if a situation is making me feel helpless, frustrated, trapped, or alone, the feelings of wanting to immediately end everything are gone by the next day (of course until the next shitty thing comes along or I get reminded of a situation). That intense feeling of emotion after a fight or a breakdown - it fades. Please don't let other people's actions - random storylines in their lives - affect your decisions. Feelings suck, especially when they won't go away. But situations can change. Jobs change, relationships change. Losing your ex must have been brutal - but they clearly brought you some joy in the past. Not getting the attention you need from your mom could be devastating, but we don't know what made her say the things she did. It could have come from a place of support. And instead of dwelling on the people who have let you down (who might be too untrained or too preoccupied to properly help), try to find a new support system, even online friends."
Question,f0fh4al,t3_d4n20z,1568583273.0,I think it's a Hebrew word. Looks very similar to a necklace an older Jewish friend has.
