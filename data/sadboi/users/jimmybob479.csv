PublicFreakout,fpaf3qr,t1_fpaca52,1588446857.0,"I agree. I had many logical and moral problems but I was able to understand that the basics of the Christian faith was indeed just that - very basic, and most of my issues stemmed from thousands of years of the church attempting to create blog posts and theology about concepts. I had a very hard time attempting to reconcile some of it, and instead was so glad, relieved, emboldened to find ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù Christianity: open to doubts, to growth, to disagreements, open to the idea that I was not born a second class citizen, but like I said - I approached it from already the self hatred perspective. God slowly had to show me that Christianity is a car, with the engine being Jesus (and Baptist‚Äôs wrongly focus on death and the afterlife - And ignore this life). Catholics think the engine works one way, Baptist‚Äôs another, but the main thing is that there is a car and we don‚Äôt have to understand it.

I believe the Bible is the word if god, but not inerrant. Progressives embrace this. I‚Äôm ok with people thinking the original text was more authentic, but a translation you hold today you can‚Äôt take as literal. When Paul was writing to the Corinthians, he was writing to the Corinthians, some truth will still apply but not we can‚Äôt claim ‚ÄúPaul told me !‚Äù

I believe Jesus is the only way to heaven, but I‚Äôm not arrogant to claim his plans. I see Abraham trusted god and it was credited to him as righteousness.

Jesus has shown me to hate Christianity, but to love and follow him more.

I grew up strict conservative baptist and over time began to be more progressive. I‚Äôd say I now have less firm theological beliefs on hell, for example. Yes I believe Jesus death saves, but we don‚Äôt quite know how God will specifically treat everyone (I think about how Abraham trusted God and it was credited to him as righteousness) and the character of god and verses make me think that when this is all over it won‚Äôt be a crazy unjust thing but that God will have saved as many as possible. I view Christianity as a miracle (Jesus death and resurrection) that occurred and a car we drive in as Christians but we‚Äôve argued from the get-go over how his death saves us (Catholics adhere more to the sacraments and grace saving is slowly, similar to the protestant‚Äôs sanctification stage)

I‚Äôve gotten more comfortable with not knowing, but still believing in Jesus. But the main tenant of progressivism is the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚Äúhere are my thoughts based on scripture and the character of god‚Äù vs pre written out positions .
