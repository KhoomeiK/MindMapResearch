She stays at home because she wants to and keeps our house spotless. I'd consider my politics and social views to be mostly progressive, but our relationship is pretty old fashioned. That was her choice. We both grew up in broken households. She enjoys the structure and discipline, I enjoy having control over our lives. That's control that she affords me, because she trusts that I'll always look out for her best interest. It makes us both feel safe and secure."

I went through the exact same thing. I was depressed for years and didn't want to get help. I thought they wouldn't be able to tell me anything I didn't already know. 

Finally one day I tried to kill myself. I won't go in to the specifics, but I was very shocked when I woke up the next morning to my roommate, who I'd never even seen so much as get teary eyed, bawling his eyes out on the phone with 911. He's not the emotional type in the slightest. That's the first and only time he's ever hugged me and we've been friends since we were kids.

My family found out and came to the hospital. I'm literally fighting back tears trying to write this. 

When you're depressed, you'll have episodes. You'll get stuck in this loop thinking that no one cares, or that killing yourself would only be doing everyone a favor. You start feeling like a burden. You start thinking that going on is pointless. But let me fucking tell you, you can't unsee the look on your friends and families faces when they find out what you've done. 

Don't do it. It's such a twisted trick to let yourself become convinced that you're not loved. It's a flat out fucking lie."

I'm 31. I made some friends in highschool. I had some fun. I dropped out. I still have a couple of the friends I made in highschool, but I've met some awesome people after highschool. People I could confide in, friends I could trust and women I could be vulnerable with. That's not to say you have to wait. You might not realize it, but you're isolating, which is a classic symptom of depression. 

Talking to a doctor or therapist about depression is important. We can't diagnosed you. Maybe it's circumstantial or maybe it's clinical. A doctor can help you with that and help set you on a path to healing."

My head can literally turn in to a crowded room where I'm jumping from conversation to conversation. Not to mention the random memories of something I said years ago to someone that makes me wanna bang my head in to a wall. I even remember the very tiny details of the look on people's faces when I said those things. I've laid in bed for hours and hours unable to sleep because of it. 

Cliche response: 

Meditation. Try an app like Headspace or Calm. Do your best to practice it. You'd be surprised at how well it quiets the mind. It's not voodoo. They've literally scanned the brains of people during meditation and can clearly see that it lowers the activity in the front lobe of the brain. It slows information uptake to a trickle. Give it a shot. If that doesn't work, talk to your primary care doctor about finding some relief now while you wait for that psych appointment."

Medicine and therapy combined have the best results, but for me meditation did the trick. Thoughts like these are almost impossible to ""talk away"" though . Therapy can teach you exercises to help you overcome those thoughts while medicine can help correct any imbalances in the brain.

We might even convince ourselves that we've never had a good day and that no good days are coming. It's just not true. You have the ability to change. You're not going to be lost forever.

To be in a normal, healthy state of mind is to be at peace with or without being in a relationship. We are naturally drawn to desire people. It keeps the population going. Your existence is your own though. You can't place it in someone else's hands. You can't put all of your reasons to live inside someone else's basket. 

You probably thought it was all over after your first marriage, but then you found someone else. Now you're losing them. That's awful, but that should also tell you that it's not over for you. So much can change in just one day. Sometimes it's bad, but sometimes it's good. You will be happy again if you stick around, that I know for sure. 

See a doctor and a therapist. They can help you cope. Try your best to take that help even if you feel like you don't want it. And please, talk to someone if you're thinking of taking your own life.  There are only a few people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate bridge. All of them said they immediately regretted it after they lept. That's before they hit the water.

During it, you might completely convince yourself that taking your own life is your only option. You'll think awful things about yourself. You'll forget that people care about you. You'll even forget that you've had good days recently. You'll think the storm is never ending. It will pass though.

Talk to a doctor about your depression. It was the best decision I ever made. Therapy helps. You might not being able to see that there really are people who care. Depression does that. It warps your perspective. Therapy can help you control.

Here's something to think about though. I was diagnosed recently after years of being too stubborn to get help. I waited for a change. And it came... And then it faded away..and then I waited for another change. Change came again...and then that faded away too, and again I was miserable...like can't even fathom the idea of living another day miserable.

This cycle went on for 15 years. I moved all over the damn country. STILL miserable. 

Now I live back in my home state, same old friends, same family. Never been happier. 

I got professional help. Waiting for things to change gets you nowhere in the end if you're clinically depressed. The change needs to happen in your mind, not in the world around you. They can help you see that.

WritingPrompts,eq9acks,t3_bxgxyh,1559896129.0,"I don't remember when it started. I couldn't recall much of my life without this...gift. In some way, it felt like it was always there. Maybe I just didn't notice it until middle school. It seemed trivial at first, convenient even. On the list of super powers, being able to know the exact time you'll arrive at home is probably all the way at the bottom. It probably doesn't even qualify as one. I never thought it would save my life.

I left work later than usual. Not by more than 30 minutes, but enough for me to miss my usual train home at 8:30pm. So I had to wait an hour for the next one. I kept checking my ETA, as I've grown used to calling it. One hour and forty-five minutes. An hour for the train to arrive and forty-five minutes until I walk through my front door. The ETA's would flash in my head like a neon sign. They were unmistakable.

Finally my 9:30 train arrived. I was eager to get home after a long day. I boarded after being in line behind several other people, found a secluded seat towards the back of my section and plopped in to it. I threw on my headphones, cranked the volume all the way up and shut my eyes.

It was maybe twenty minutes after departing when I decided to recheck my ETA. Once in a while, the time would change. It was a very rare occurrence, but enough for me to check more than once. This would usually occur when someone would make an impulse decision. I know this because I witnessed a car accident as a child. Road rage. It added an hour or so to my ETA.

I focused my mind and checked.

*Four years, two months, twenty four days, thirteen hours and twenty six minutes.*

Startled, I opened my eyes and sat up straight in my seat. This doesn't make sense. I checked my surroundings to make sure I was still on the same train, thinking I perhaps fell asleep and missed my stop. That still wouldn't explain my ETA.

While checking my surroundings, I noticed every passenger in my section was staring out of the windows on my side. Confused, I turned to look for myself. After rubbing my eyes several times to make sure I wasn't just seeing things, I realized what that I was looking at--what we all were looking at, was very real. A massive, pitch black sphere hovered over the city. Tendrils of liquid light circulated around it as if in orbit. Storm clouds were gathered overhead, circling. I felt my heart begin to race. I couldn't look away.

The train passed through a tunnel and broke our line of sight. Most of the passengers still stared out of the window, now looking at brick wall racing by, unwilling to turn away. Others asked themselves what they'd just witnessed, as if anyone of us could give them an answer. We'd have one soon enough.

The train emerged from the tunnel. We were met with a blinding light, emitting from the black sphere. I covered my eyes and looked away. I tried to glance back once but it burned my eyes. You could feel the heat from it. Then, in an instance it switched off.

The middle of the blacksphere now showed an image of space. Millions of stars and a moon even in the background. Not our moon. An image of spiked grey space ships appeared. Hundreds of them. Without warning, they came through the black sphere.

Immediately upon entering our world, they opened fire. Massive ships fired blue beams that swept across the city, causing explosions, sending large chunks of skyscrapers hurdling towards the ground. Thousands of smaller ships were dispatched from the larger ones, unleashing red rapid fire in to cars and buses.

The passengers on my train panicked. Everyone scrambled towards the front of the train, shouting at staff to stop the train. The conductor was way ahead of them. The brakes on the train slammed hard, sending several people on to the floor, along with luggage, papers and personal belongings. I braced myself on the seat in front me until we finally came to a stop. It was just me in this section now. I stood to my feet and ran towards the front of the train, well behind the other passengers. As soon as I stepped foot in next section, a bright neon number flashed in my mind. A new ETA.

*Zero.*

I froze in place. That number should only appear when I'm already home. My legs and hands began to tremble. I didn't know what to do. I took a step back into my original section. Another flash of numbers appeared.

*Four years, two months, twenty four days, thirteen hours and 20 minutes.*

My gift seemed to activating on its own. I didn't need to focus. I realized what it was telling me. In the same instance, I realized the people towards the front of the train were going to die if I didn't intervene.

I called out to them.

""Turn around! It's not safe--"", one of the smaller ships, a fighter, launched a fiery barrage in to the train. It ripped and burned through the train like glowing hot plasma. I was sent flying backwards from the impact. I hit the floor hard and slid several feet before hitting the door on the back of the train. I took a moment to gather myself, stood up and ran out of the door.

&#x200B;

**Four years, two months, twenty four days and thirteen hours later.**

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since Emergence Day. The alien race who attacked us destroyed every major city, cutting the worlds population nearly in half. But we're fighting back. We've found new ways to kill them, weaknesses in their systems. For the first time since E. Day, we finally have them on the back foot.

I'm a new man now. War has shaped me, both physically and mentally. The scars I wear on my face only serve to remind me of the hatred I harbor towards the enemy...and the pain I feel knowing I couldn't save you in time. Tomorrow morning I'll lead an assault on the Alien stronghold, 300,000 brave men and women behind me. I haven't got the heart to tell them my ETA is reading zero. Guess I'm hoping for a miracle.

I came home to write this letter to tell you I'm sorry for not coming home sooner, knowing you guys would never be able to read it. Maybe in the next life I can tell you in person.

&#x200B;

""We don't use the word *rape* around here, young one."", Jake answered. His voice suddenly carrying hints of an English accent.

&#x200B;

""Well, you should. Cause that guy's a rapist! Like, convicted, guilty, got-let-off-with-a-light-sentence, class A...Ra-ra-rapist!"", Tanner declared.

&#x200B;

""We prefer the term 'Surprise Fuckist', Tanner. You're being kind of a bummer, dude."", one of the hooded men in the group claimed.

&#x200B;

""Yes, plus if she didn't want it, she could have told him to stop."", spoke another unknown frat boy.

&#x200B;

""She was unconscious behind a dumpster you dumbass! She couldn't say stop. A surprise fuck is still rape too, moron."", Tanner replied angrily.

&#x200B;

""Sounds like she was asking for it then"", Jake chimed in. Tanner put his hand on his forehead in shame and disbelief as Jake continued. ""All I'm saying is if I pass out behind dumpster, I expect to get raped""--""Surprise fucked"", a voice corrected from the group. ""Right, surprise fucked"", Jake added while nodding confidently at Tanner.

&#x200B;

""So you guys brought me here to worship this fucking guy? You know he's not even dead right? Whats with the memorial, shrine thing?"", asked Tanner still angry and in disbelief.

&#x200B;

""He got kicked outta' school though!"", another hooded frat boy answered. ""And he had to do like six months, man. That's like a lifetime bro."", Aiden added before kissing his fingers and throwing up a peace sign. ""Rest in peace, homie"" he finished in a low, quiet voice, almost as if talking to himself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tanner couldn't even process his anger. He stared blankly at Aiden for what felt like six months or a lifetime. Same thing. He looked away, glancing at the countless candles around the room. An idea burned bright in his mind and it brought him comfort. He knew what he needed to do.

&#x200B;

Tanner reached over and knocked a handful of lit candles on to the floor, then reach over and knocked more over on to the canvas. It didn't take long before the room was engulfed in flames. Tanner walked out of the frat house calmly with a big grin on his face, while his former frat brothers screamed and panicked. Most of them ran out of the house, a couple stayed a little longer to try and extinguish the flames by throwing beer bottles at it. Shortly after, the entire house was ablaze. Tanner stood there watching with a serial killer kind of amusement.

&#x200B;

Jake ran over to one of the frat boys on the lawn, grabbed him by the robe and pulled him close.

&#x200B;

""Where the fuck is Aiden!?"" he asked desperately.

&#x200B;

""He went inside to grab his Shit Pic album, dude. I don't think he made it out!"" the frat boy answered, crying with snot running form his nose.

&#x200B;

Jake fell to his knees and looked up at the sky with tears in his eyes. He made his despair known with a loud shrieking scream. How could Brock have forsaken them? Why didn't their lord and savior stop Tanner dead in his tracks? The good Brock fuckith, the good Brock suckith, as the old Cold Ones' saying goes. Jake had witnessed this first hand.

&#x200B;

Tanner was charged and convicted with manslaughter and arson. He received six months in jail with three years probation. Jake started a petition in an attempt to get Tanner to serve a longer sentence, but a judge denied the appeal, stating ""if you didn't want your house to burn down, you shouldn't have lit so many candles. You were asking for it."""
WritingPrompts,eq4mofz,t3_bwxn14,1559780298.0,"The room erupted in to cheers and applause as Tanner finally passed his last test to become a member of the fraternity.

&#x200B;

""You passed bro!"", Jake called out in excitement. ""Now it's time to crack open a boy with the cold ones!""

&#x200B;

Tanner looked up at Jake, unsure if Jake said that ironically or by mistake. Tanner pulled the bottle from his butt cheeks, wincing as the frost had partially stuck to his tender skin. He held the beer out to Jake who snatched it quickly and opened it. He chugged the beer in seconds, which caused the frat brothers to erupt in to more applause and cheer.

As Jake lowered the bottle from his lips, Tanner caught a quick glimpse of Jake licking the outside of the bottle. Although a little disturbing, he ignored it. 

&#x200B;

Jake let out a long burp, filling the air with the scent of hot dogs and perhaps butthole. At least that's what he surmised. Tanner admired Jake for his manliness. He was everything Tanner wanted to be.

&#x200B;

""Broski, you passed that last test in record time. You even beat my old record. It's like you're the chosen one or some shit."" Jake explained while wiping the beer from his soul patch with his hand.

&#x200B;

""That was hella crazy Tan-man!"", Aiden called out from the group, approaching Tanner. The nickname was a little generic, but Tanner was growing used to it.

&#x200B;

Aiden was a short man. He was also a gross man. He was known throughout the campus for his extensive photographed portfolio of shit pics. Yes, the man literally kept a family photo album of different bowel movements he'd taken over the years. He was well liked among the fraternity, but women on campus had often described him as ""literally unfuckable"".

&#x200B;

Tanner noticed Aiden carrying something behind his back as he approached, the smirk on his face landing somewhere between mischievous and that look people get when they really have to shit.

&#x200B;

""Everyone gather 'round!"", Aiden ordered to everyone in the frat. ""It's time to begin the ritual!""

&#x200B;

Aiden finally revealed what he was hiding behind his back. A black, velvet robe. He knelt down on one knee and handed it to Tanner. He took it, looking around the room to see if anyone else was as confused as him. Guess it was just him.

&#x200B;

Everyone migrated and gathered around Tanner in a circle. Once they were all in place, Jake gave a knowing nod and in completely perfect synchronicity, everyone began to strip down completely naked. Jake tried not to stare, but couldn't find a suitable place to put his eyes. It seemed like everywhere he looked, a dick was there to meet his eyes. Some bigger than others, but all of them small. Thankfully they began to dress, but not in to the same clothes. Each of them dressed in to a thick, black robe, the same as the one Aiden gave to Tanner.

&#x200B;

""BEGIN!"", Jake called out, standing the closest to Tanner, seemingly unembarrassed about having the shortest of shortcomings in the room. All at once, the fully grown, adult men of the fraternity cupped their hands behind their asses and farted in to them. ""LOOSE!"" ordered Jake. With Jake's command, they all *threw* their farts in to Tanner's face.

&#x200B;

The smell was something otherworldly. It attacked the nervous system. It caused flashbacks to the Vietnam war he was never in. Tanner fell to his knees, clenching his throat as the smell had somehow made its way into his digestive track. It smelled like the holocaust. It was a gas chamber. His eyes watered, snot poured from his nose and his eyes became bloodshot.

&#x200B;

It faded. Suddenly he could breathe again. Jake held his hands out for Tanner to pull himself back to his feet. Tanner grabbed his hands tightly and stood.

&#x200B;

""You're ready to join The Cold Ones"", Jake said calmly. ""Come with us.""

&#x200B;

The frat lined up, and began chanting words Tanner couldn't make out. Jake pulled Tanner in line behind him. They walked down the hallway, one by one until reaching a large double door leading in to a den. It had been locked since Tanner arrived and he always found himself curious of what was on the other side. He couldn't help but feel excited about it.

&#x200B;

Aiden pulled a large, iron key from his robe and unlocked the door. He glanced back at Tanner with a grin before shoving both doors open hard and swinging his hands above his head in a grand gesture.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tanner peered around his frat brothers, struggling to make out exactly what he was looking at. There were hundreds of lit candles. Couch cushions were organised around a picture on a canvas, surrounded by plants, roses and empty beer cans. It was some kind of shrine, but to what? To who? To whom? Whoms? Whomith? Who,woo,woo-to who?

&#x200B;

Whomsoever the case, the frat boys gathered and knelt before the shrine.

&#x200B;

""This is the shrine of our lord and master"", Aiden explained. ""It is from him that we receive our blessings. It is from him that all of this is possible. He is both our father and our creator. We worship his holy name so that we may too""--Tanner thought the person in the image looked familiar and stepped closer for a better look. Aiden paused for a moment before continuing. ""So that we may too walk his path of""--Tanner interrupted.

&#x200B;

""Is that fucking Brock Turner?"", he asked, stunned by how high pitch his voice came out. ""Like, the guy who raped that girl behind a dumpster? Are you guys fucking with me right now?"".

Shortly after earth received a transmission from an alien spacecraft, a meeting took place between the alien god and our very own Christian god.

The golden door of the meeting room opened, interrupting the laughter from some inside joke between both gods. Fog bellowed from the door way as Jesus Christ stepped through it.

""Ah! This is my son, Jesus Christ."", God exclaimed, happy to show the alien god such a stalwart example of the good in humanity. ""This is Garbrakon, the god of--I'm sorry, what was the name of your species again?""

""Andromedans."", replied Garbrakon with a polite smile as his eyes met Jesus. His look turned to confusion as he noticed the strange attire that Jesus was dressed in. Jesus wore a black t-shirt with the words ""Lamb of God"" written on it, accompanied by a black pair of pants with far too many zippers and a staggering amount of facial piercings. This didn't seem like the holy figure the human god described in the slightest.

""Forgive me for not asking sooner, but do you have a name in which your followers call you?"", Garbrakon asked, turning his attention back towards God.

God opened his mouth to speak but, Jesus interrupted. ""His name is Jehovah, but a lot of humans throw a shit-fit if you call him that."", Jesus stated with a sarcastic smirk on his face.

""No matter"", replied Garbrakon. ""Let us discuss the compatibility between our beloved species and discover how we might co-exist.""

Jesus burst in to laughter for a short moment before interjecting again. ""You think this fucking guy is going to 'co-exist' with anyone who doesn't believe in him? Did he even tell you about the crusades?"", Jesus asked, gesturing with his thumb to his father.

Garbrakon looked towards God curiously.

""It's not like that--I, uh--that was a long time ago! I'm not like that anymore"", answered God with a look of embarrassment on his face.

Jesus wasn't done. ""If you were smart, you'd take your penis shaped alien ships and fuck right off, Garbage-can, or whatever your name is! This guy has leveled a city, flooded his entire planet and made a guy straight up kill his own son all because he can't control his little temper tantrums!"", he explained, snickering all the while.

Gods face turned red and he began to sweat and stutter, desperately trying to find a response. Garbrakon didn't wait for an explanation before speaking.

""You told me you were the leader of a religion of peace, yet you punish and kill your own creations with such brutality."" Garbrakon asked with concern and perhaps a little sadness in his voice.

God's temper flared and he didn't even bother answering the question before turning and yelling at his son for his harsh criticisms. ""YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME SHOW HIM HOW PEACEFUL WE ARE! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, WHAT THE HELL HAS GOTTEN IN TO YOU!?"", God yelled, spit flying from his mouth as he glared angrily at Jesus.

The room fell into an awkward silence as God began to think he'd lost the respect of a fellow creator.

""Hell?"", asked Garbrakon calmly. ""What is that word?""

God hung his head, placing both his hands on his forehead in shame. Meanwhile, Jesus was rocking back and forth in his chair excitedly while covering his mouth in an attempt to mask his laughter. He couldn't contain himself any longer.

""IT'S WHERE MY FATHER SENDS PEOPLE TO BURN FOR AN ETERNITY IF THEY DON'T LOVE HIM!"", Jesus cried out in laughter while stomping his feet on the floor uncontrollably.

""Fuck my life."" God muttered to himself quietly, shaking his head and pinching the bridge of his nose to sate the headache he was starting to feel.

""I think I've heard enough"", Garbrakon declared, now rising to his feet.

God stood and looked at Garbrakon for the first time in several minutes. With shame in his eyes, he reached his hand out for a shake.

""I'm sorry if I misled you. Despite what my people may think, I am not perfect."", God admitted with sorrow hanging heavy in his voice.

Jesus rolled his eyes, dismissing the sincerity of his fathers words.

""What?"", Garbrakon asked in confusion. He leaned his head back as if shocked by God's words. ""This is all pretty standard god stuff, my dude. You gotta fuck your people's shit up once and while if they get ungrateful. Bunch of whiny little shit bags, most of em'!"".

He grabbed God's hand firmly and shook it. God lifted his gaze with a smile, now feeling comfortable in the company of his peer.

Jesus had stopped laughing. He stood there in shock with his jaw hanging wide open.

""I gotta' admit, you had me worried you were one of those boring, Mr. Do-Good gods"", laughed God, still shaking Garbrakon's hand.

""Hell no!"", he replied. ""My son hates me too. You sacrifice him once and let him die a slow and painful death, and all of a sudden, they get a stick up their ass.""

""Or a cross!"", God added. They both erupted in to laughter.

Jesus put his hands in the air in defeat, turned and walked out of the room while shaking his head. As the door opened, he saw his forsaken brother, Satan standing before him.

""What's got your panties in a bunch, loser?"", he asked, shoulder checking Jesus on his way through the door. He didn't even wait for an answer.

""Hey-oh!"", Satan called out in excitement, announcing his presence to the room while pointing both of his thumbs at himself.

""Now the party can start!"", God exclaimed.

Jesus could hear the muffled laughter from the hallway after the door shut."
