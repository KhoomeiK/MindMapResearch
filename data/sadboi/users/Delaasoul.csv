Most popular kids were “cool” because they had nice things like expensive clothes, nice cars, lived in gated communities, were good at sports,  or were really good looking. 

But in my experience these things didn’t make them bad or mean people. Maybe I never saw that side of them but for the most part I don’t think our school had a huge problem with bullying. Our theater kids basically owned homecoming court 

We had a mix of really really wealthy people and fairly poor people and they all interacted well. Like we had parties in gated communities in million dollar houses which would often get shut down because the kids who were in gangs would start fights/pull out guns 

My hometown had one private high school so perhaps the worst of the worst went there. I went to a public school."

SF Is a great fit for people who care more about nature and outdoor activities but still want that “city life”

I think NYC would be fun in your early twenties (21-25 or so) and SF better for your late twenties and so on, when you care less about clubs and would like more chill activities like going to Tahoe or Napa

I struggled with another issue that left me in terrible pain for a year. Was misdiagnosed a bunch and finally found a helpful doctor and had surgery last summer. And then the ear issues started a few months later so I’ve essentially been in non-stop discomfort/often pain, for a few years now and it’s definitely taken a toll so I can relate

The music stuff sounds cool! I’m not well versed on composing but that could be interesting. I’d like to get into cooking. Maybe painting/drawing, even pottery if I find places that aren’t too loud.

COVID is helping with that FOMO feeling a bit but I worry once things start up again I’ll be even more depressed. While I hate to know others are suffering, the internet certainly helps, knowing that there are people my age that have also had to put their lives on hold and I’m not totally alone.

Also btw things looking grainy in the dark isn’t normal lol, that’s visual snow and your comment about there always being noise isn’t correct. There might be little noises here and there (things outside, noises from appliances, etc) but it is absolutely possible to be in a quiet room and not hear “brain noise”

No one here is seeking Anechoic Chamber level since, missing silence is more a figure of speech than anything"

tinnitus,fozz1w2,t1_fozwaxe,1588199431.0,"Last I checked I’m not breaking any sub rules. I’m not obligated to include everyone and to be honest don’t really care if it seems off to you.

If someone wanted to know how many males under 30 are on here, their question would be valid and I wouldn’t get upset by it because I’m sure the person posing the question isn’t doing it to be malicious. Like I said, I had my reason for posting. 

Have a nice day."
tinnitus,fozw1e7,t1_fozvc81,1588197870.0,"Not everything in life is going to include you, it’s not that deep

Are you really offended that there’s a post on Reddit that doesn’t include you? Lol"
tinnitus,fozv00a,t1_foz9oo1,1588197342.0,"It’s just a question on Reddit. Your question of “do the sexes suffer differently” certainly doesn’t back up your “not trying to be an ass” comment 

I have my reasons for asking and if you’re genuinely curious I can let you know what it is, but now really sure why you even care"
tinnitus,fowgur0,t1_fow21ib,1588119517.0,I wonder too. I tried it out with my mom and she definitely doesn’t have the same issues as I do
tinnitus,fowgsro,t1_fovw1ap,1588119485.0,I bought an adult coloring book with tons of small lines and it was just...not happening lol
