Most popular kids were ‚Äúcool‚Äù because they had nice things like expensive clothes, nice cars, lived in gated communities, were good at sports,  or were really good looking. 

But in my experience these things didn‚Äôt make them bad or mean people. Maybe I never saw that side of them but for the most part I don‚Äôt think our school had a huge problem with bullying. Our theater kids basically owned homecoming court 

We had a mix of really really wealthy people and fairly poor people and they all interacted well. Like we had parties in gated communities in million dollar houses which would often get shut down because the kids who were in gangs would start fights/pull out guns

I think NYC would be fun in your early twenties (21-25 or so) and SF better for your late twenties and so on, when you care less about clubs and would like more chill activities like going to Tahoe or Napa

For many, even despite knowing what brought it on (ear infection, bad cold, TMD, etc) and addressing the issue, the Tinnitus remains.

Lots of people attribute it to something like a cold, ETD, neck issue but it could be that they just had years of cumulative noise damage and one final event like loud music in the car or one more cold set it off permanently"
tinnitus,fp17yau,t1_fp16ux2,1588226990.0,"There‚Äôs a huge difference between having very very mild visual snow to where it‚Äôs virtually undetectable and actually perceiving the dark as being grainy and having noticeable snow

I definitely never noticed any sort of snow or
Grain in the dark prior to Tinnitus. I‚Äôve also asked many people about it and they don‚Äôt have it so just because you‚Äôve asked a few people about it doesn‚Äôt mean much

I‚Äôm sure everyone does experience visual snow to an extent as per your description, but my point is when the dark is noticeably grainy to the point where you feel the need to bring it up, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù"
tinnitus,fp15tvn,t3_gapkrr,1588225229.0,"It‚Äôs less about hearing the sound of silence, but more about being in a silent room and not hearing  a terrible ringing in your ears that you can‚Äôt escape 

Also btw things looking grainy in the dark isn‚Äôt normal lol, that‚Äôs visual snow and your comment about there always being noise isn‚Äôt correct. There might be little noises here and there (things outside, noises from appliances, etc) but it is absolutely possible to be in a quiet room and not hear ‚Äúbrain noise‚Äù

No one here is seeking Anechoic Chamber level since, missing silence is more a figure of speech than anything"

If someone wanted to know how many males under 30 are on here, their question would be valid and I wouldn‚Äôt get upset by it because I‚Äôm sure the person posing the question isn‚Äôt doing it to be malicious. Like I said, I had my reason for posting. 

Have a nice day."
tinnitus,fozw1e7,t1_fozvc81,1588197870.0,"Not everything in life is going to include you, it‚Äôs not that deep

Are you really offended that there‚Äôs a post on Reddit that doesn‚Äôt include you? Lol"
tinnitus,fozv00a,t1_foz9oo1,1588197342.0,"It‚Äôs just a question on Reddit. Your question of ‚Äúdo the sexes suffer differently‚Äù certainly doesn‚Äôt back up your ‚Äúnot trying to be an ass‚Äù comment 

I have my reasons for asking and if you‚Äôre genuinely curious I can let you know what it is, but now really sure why you even care"
tinnitus,fowgur0,t1_fow21ib,1588119517.0,I wonder too. I tried it out with my mom and she definitely doesn‚Äôt have the same issues as I do
