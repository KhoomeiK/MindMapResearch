I told him walking from the night club (it was for 16 and up).    He asked if I wanted a ride and I said sure.   He's a cop after all.    

He takes me home and then proceeded to ask for my phone number.   He looked 35 to 45.   I told him I'm only 15, he said that doesn't matter and kept bugging me.  I went to get out and he grabbed my hand.  I wriggled away, got out and went inside.   Never saw him again but what a creep!

This was a slc police officer.     

I stopped trusting them.   And after a cop shot a dog in his own back yard I have disliked them more.    Not saying all cops are bad but there are a lot of bad apples in slc."

It is our money but I would like  the govt to help those in need first.    People need to eat and stay where they live.
