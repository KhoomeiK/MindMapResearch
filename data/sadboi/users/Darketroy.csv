PostMalone,fqfxdab,t3_ghn3os,1589333578.0,For me it's gotta be Sugar Wraith. I just love the overall vibe it gives off.
PostMalone,fqej61j,t3_gh9xfc,1589308425.0,Dude this is awesome! Good job on making it. It's both catchy and funny at the same time.
NoStupidQuestions,fqauxo4,t1_fqas8kc,1589225718.0,"Thanks for trying to find it for me but that's a bit too different. His looks more like a long button shirt rather than a coat now that I think about it. 

Anyway thanks again for bothering with this in the first place."

techsupport,fijj5ns,t3_f862vi,1582450424.0,Funnily enough I had this happen to me like a week ago. Freaked out about having to get a new monitor but then just restarted my pc and it was gone. Really weird but I am glad it's just a software bug.
AskReddit,fic3usj,t3_f7e9oq,1582336966.0,For me it's gotta be Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic. Sure graphics are a bit outdated but it's such a blast to play just for the gameplay. Really satisfying melee combat. Story is nothing amazing but it does the trick. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys some brutal and fluid melee combat.
techsupport,fi2m1c9,t1_fi2jxtz,1582082935.0,"My first thought was that someone made a typo. I checked ""have I been pwned"" and I have one breach(which I already am aware of) but that happened years ago. Nothing suspicious has happened yet but will keep an eye for. For passwords I use a completely different password for every important account but do use the same or slightly altered password for accounts I dont care that much about. I really hope this is a mistake and not done on purpose for shady things."
techsupport,fi2le1y,t1_fi2jlmu,1582082489.0,Yeah I'll do that tomorrow. Really hope it's nothing.
techsupport,fi2lb33,t1_fi2jeuw,1582082432.0,Could be just a mistake but I feel a bit uneasy knowing someone's using my email for their account. Gonna try to delete it tomorrow.
techsupport,fi2l65y,t1_fi2jajy,1582082339.0,"Yeah fingers crossed it's nothing. Gonna try and delete the account tomorrow using the ""forgot my password""."

buildapc,ff6r1jz,t1_ff6otm2,1579633086.0,The Commander controller from Corsair costs more than the fans so definitely not getting it. Just gonna use the fan headers on the mobo and the psu. Thanks!
buildapc,ff6qw6f,t1_ff6os60,1579632997.0,"Oh, alright. Guess I'll just plug 2 of them into the motherboard and connect 1 to the psu. Thanks for clarifying!"
HomeImprovement,f79j1tw,t1_f79h5g3,1573508311.0,"That's the worst part, not knowing whether the insulation is gone or not. Yes circuit breakers are there to help but a circuit breaker can trip for multiple reasons. I am so stressed right now about it even though I can't do anything right now haha. Guess I'll just contact the landlord see if he can do anything about it."
HomeImprovement,f79h880,t1_f79gfd4,1573507545.0,So should I even bother with traps or just contact the landlord immediately? Also isn't an exterminator quite expensive? Will the landlord actually get one cause that would be fantastic. Thanks for replying!
HomeImprovement,f79gwas,t1_f79eu46,1573507407.0,"""Just a moment""? Damn, well that means a fire could start anytime and kill me, great. Man how much I love the UK. Thanks for the reply."
HomeImprovement,f79govo,t1_f79eoix,1573507318.0,I will let him know about the problem. Thanks!
NoStupidQuestions,f739q9p,t1_f738g2k,1573389530.0,I know that but what I meant is that I would expect them to last a bit more than a few weeks. Guess it's just me.
NoStupidQuestions,f739l5b,t1_f737xsp,1573389484.0,Got it! Thanks for replying

askanelectrician,f4llpjs,t1_f4lk8bg,1571668627.0,"Thank you so much, now I don't have to stress about any of this. All of the ratings are written on the plugs so that is why I put them. Even when I read those ratings myself I thought they were a bit too much. The computer is a mid tier gaming pc(can go into specs if you want to) and the speakers are some logitech ones.

How would you advise to calculate how much it actually draws rather than calculating the maximum draw. Again thank you so much for your response, you made my day!"
buildapc,f24vzsl,t1_f24jriu,1569961315.0,Got it. Thanks! :)

Also what do you mean by ""desk wan't compatible with a clamp"" part?"
learnpython,f1npgtg,t1_f1jep9l,1569622801.0,Nice idea but I think I am just going to stick with what my teacher says. Maybe I will try and learn the new version on my own. Thanks for the reply!
learnpython,f1npchc,t1_f1k7axt,1569622710.0,I will try and ask him when I go to his class. But I bet he is gonna say something about the exam board and how this version is used for it. Thanks for replying!
learnpython,f1np8ps,t1_f1jdu3b,1569622632.0,Guess I will just download the version the teacher tells me to. Thanks for the reply!

There is something I don't quite get tho. You said you were sent to the principal every week. Wouldn't the principal maybe ask for your side of the story? And if they went as much as once a week wouldn't the principal maybe think they are just making stuff up just to get you in trouble?"

Here my mental health is degrading day by day, I feel depressed and lonely every day and have to see and interact with people that are just bullies for no reason. Summer is really the only time I actually feel happy as that's the only time I get to go on vacation to my native country and spend time with lovely people. I really want my old life back."
buildapc,erhbebr,t1_ergkbdw,1560871622.0,Great idea! Will definitely be considering doing that.
buildapc,erhbany,t1_erfvv51,1560871558.0,Sounds horrible! I doubt they will go away on their own. How did you deal with them for those 3 days when they were there?
buildapc,erffp4f,t1_erfca8v,1560807269.0,Interesting though how a few years ago when I had a prebuilt system in my old house I also had an ant infestation for a short while and them ants were just underneath the PC. Bet they even went it but nothing fried or short-circuited.
buildapc,erffilu,t1_erf4zy0,1560807146.0,Most people say otherwise but I guess we'll have to see. Hope they don't even come in my room lol
buildapc,erffdd5,t1_erf63a4,1560807046.0,That pretty horrible! In such a place you wouldn't really notice. But I guess they went there as It a very warm place.
buildapc,erff188,t1_erfb9pj,1560806818.0,"If they want a warm place, would not using the computer be an option for them to not make a nest in the PC? I start getting pretty paranoid when it comes to harm being done to my PC lol"

offmychest,eqxgsfg,t1_eqxed50,1560369153.0,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Thinking about it I guess that was really the whole point of her walking with me but it was nice anyway. I can't really seem to find a way to ""feel"" different at school. I am just tired of all those mean and fake people and I just can't wait to go to college. Maybe there I will find some real friends that I would actually like spending time with.   


Thank you for the reply dude :)"
