They might want to check your thyroid levels and things like that, to properly diagnose you. They don’t usually do too much blood work. Unless you’re on lithium, then they might take lithium levels after a few days.

As for like, being randomly jabbed with needles because you need to be sedated, that almost never happens. They try everything else to have you come down, and they will always offer you to take pills instead of a needle based sedative if you’re really freaking out."

Getting triggered is not a good time. I don’t know if this helps you, but my therapist noticed that when I get triggered I usually have one to two bad weeks, and then things go back to baseline. Every time. No matter how hard it gets or how much I want to die, I go back to normal. 

Normal used to be really bad, but now normal is bearable, and even ok sometimes. It took a lot of time and a lot of therapy.

Speaking of which, are you seeing a therapist? This might be a good time to call them, and let them know what’s going on, if you are. 

It just sucks. And it sounds like you have every right to be angry.

Sometimes, when I’m getting really self destructive, I have to force myself to be gentle with myself. It sounds kind of dumb, but it works over time. Soft blankets, candles, tea, petting my cat for a while. Reminding myself that, when I’m triggered, I’m basically sick for a bit. And to treat myself kindly throughout it.

The best thing to do right now is to let someone in real life know how badly you’re struggling. Is there a friend you can tell? A family member?

I wasn’t well suited for the job I had, though I was good at it.

I would give it some more time, maybe another month or so, and if it just doesn’t feel like a good job, maybe it isn’t the job for you. And that’s totally fine.  It doesn’t say anything bad about you, just that you aren’t particularly suited for this.
