Just thought some other people here would have appreciated this coat‚Äôs look. 

Rest of the fit is a pair of high waisted checkered pants from AEO and some extra classic style Doc Martens."

curlyhair,fnt6241,t1_fnt0raz,1587235308.0,I find that my curls do better without too many products so the regular routine is just OGX Argan Oil shampoo and extra strength conditioner. Then one towel scrunch and then some wet scrunch just using my hands. Normally I do praying hands with Shea Moisture curl milk and air dry but with this product I raked through three generous pumps then diffused upside down on low heat for six or seven minutes.
curlyhair,fnt0raz,t3_g3rpwy,1587232423.0,So my hair if left untouched and air dried does nice thick and long ringlets but today I used the Tigi FoxyCurls and I‚Äôm one tease away from hair metal! Thinner ringlets and less curl with this product as it should be used as a hard cast but I wanted to see how well it would diffuse. Not my ideal look but I think this is a fun curl style to switch it up.

A few weeks ago my significant other took me out for an adventure he had planned for me and I LOVED it. Next day I was complaining about forgetting something and he asks ‚ÄúWhat did we do yesterday?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt tell him ANY of it. Broke my heart, I fell out of my chair when he showed me some photos we had taken. I completely forgot a meaningful day I had with someone I love and the day was YESTERDAY.
