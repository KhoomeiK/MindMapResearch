I'd prefer to have a ""dumb"" factory gauge, as opposed to a light, because the light doesn't tell me much aside from the temp is past a predetermined point. At least with a temp gauge you start to see progressive temperature increases once it passes that threshold to make the gauge move.

As far as going back to a school that I claimed committed fraud;
the regular bachelors degrees are very reputable. This is actually a very well known and respected university. 

My complaint is moreso how they represented and pitched this two year AAS program. I'm not saying the school as a whole is fraudulent, however, I do believe this particular program they offer (and how they offered it) is.  I understand students aren't guaranteed job placement, that's just common knowledge. I wouldn't expect a school to be responsible for that. But when the school baits you as a prospective student with a great career after graduation, all the doors it will open, then to find out that not a single job in this field I have looked at will take a two year degree.



I can understand if I just wasn't getting hired for reasons outside of the educational requirement, but the very credential this program boasts will do all these wonderful things, fails to deliver on what they said, as virtually every employer I have found wants higher education than the AAS. 




About the transfer thing - 

It's different than simply declaring a major change, or changing to a different college within the same university. If i were an undergrad engineering major, and I wanted to change to chemistry, for example, there are inter campus transfer requirements, yes. 




The best way I can think to compare it is the statement you would see on ITT tech ""credits earned are unlikely to transfer.""  They don't disclose this upfront, but if you look at the degree audit for this AAS, the credits do not transfer to any other college/school inside the university. 




It's like it is intentionally setup that way.  You don't take English 101 and 102, you take ""writing skills I"" and ""writing skills II""  You don't take undergraduate math classes, you take special 'AAS' math classes. None of them transfer to any four year program the university offers. 




They don't tell you that ahead of time. I went in thinking having this degree would allow me a better job or a better path into an undergraduate program, it doesn't, the credits are useless even to the university, but they definitely advertise moving onto the four year program.




They don't specifically state you can use the credits for entrance into an undergrad program, however, they do advertise on the AAS program website that you can move on to the four year undergraduate program, neglecting to tell you that nothing will transfer that you earned as an AAS student, and that you are treated as an outside transfer student, and you will have had to have taken 20 credit hours of undergraduate course work (which you wouldn't have been allowed to take in that program, they will not allow you into normal four year courses.) 




They explain this degree as holding such value, yet no employers accept a credential that low that I've seen. They advertise advancement onto an undergraduate program at the university as a result of getting your aas, yet leave out the mention of requirements you wont have earned by being in that aas program.




They intentionally make sure these AAS classes are not accepted at the undergraduate level.  Here is a real life example, first hand experience, verbally from my professor at the time: 




AAS Students took a class, lets call it AAS-A. It teaches curriculum composed of B.  

Four year students in the same college at the same university take the exact same class, that covers the exact same material, even by the exact same professor, however, the course is numbered differently.  The professor even offered to give students credit for the ""four year version"" if they met certain requirements.  The only difference is the number of the course.  




The university, as far as I can tell, classifies students are Undergrad, Grad/PhD, and AAS. 

The way it was setup when I attended, any undergrad courses are 100 level and up.  Grad students are 500 and above.  AAS students were all sub 100 level courses.  Almost like remedial classes you would take at a community college.  Even though that class I referenced above was absolutely identical, we didn't get ""four year credit"" just because they have it numbered differently for AAS students.  







It's things like that which weren't presented or even mentioned in their promotional materials, admissions, orientation, etc.  I'm sorry for the long winded reply.  I just feel in my experience, they say it will do all of this, then once you get in the door and start paying for it, it isn't what they make it out to be. If my degree were as valuable as that page made it seem, I would have been gainfully employed by now, or I would not have had to take so many extra classes to meet undergraduate entrance requirements, because the courses they teach to aas students don't. But they sure mention you can move onto their bachelors."
RX7,faj0wyi,t1_faiymio,1576121450.0,"I wouldn't count that as a bolt on. I'd use it as a baseline. A healthy engine is a healthy engine, if you are trying to squeeze power out of an engine on it's last legs you already have significantly more problems to worry about."

I mean the FB/SA already has the power to weight ratio in its favor, with the FC though, you are talking a heavier car. S4's are even worse due to the fact that the 5th/6th ports are actuated off exhaust backpressure, so modifying the exhaust can actually cause them to not function correctly. 

&#x200B;

S5's have a bit more N/A power out of the gate, but not by much, largely due to the compression ratio and the VDI. But anyway, I wasn't trying to deliberately come off as abrasive towards the op, but realistically, any gains will not be a radical difference."

&#x200B;

I mean, considering what it puts out stock, that is a pretty decent gain I suppose. I'm used to forced induction with the FC and FD, where a full Racing Beat exhaust on a TII nets a 40-50hp gain.

Paint is oxidized to hell, the engine bay (unfortunately) looks like a good amount of FC's, hacked to hell with tasteless and pointless mods. No AC, no PS, a terribly done efan setup...running the turbo without so much as a filter on it.  Classic example of poor choice of modding and doing it cheap, I'd be willing to bet the coolant seals went out because of the owners treatment of the car.

&#x200B;

Interiors pretty rough, no radio, no center vent, random wires strewn about, passenger kick panel not seated. Coolant seals have gone out, I'm willing to bet the car's been sitting, which means if water has gotten inside the engine (and it likely has) its rusted and probably not salvageable for the most part.  That is unless the owner took the time to drain the coolant and fill the plug holes with a good amount of oil and rotate the engine to displace any coolant/water to prevent rust damage.

&#x200B;

This might be going out on a limb here, but I'd doubt the authenticity of if that car's a factory Turbo II as its shown. The only part of that car that is somewhat 'clean' is the Turbo II hood. It doesn't match the rest of the car in terms of paint condition, so I'd say it was possibly swapped, and poorly at that.

&#x200B;

Honestly that car's probably more trouble than it's worth, you'd spend more time and money fixing the past and current owners poor treatment than anything. I'd offer him 2k-3k if its a genuine Turbo II.  The engines probably trash, the body is in bad shape, its missing parts interior and exterior wise, it's a mess. Of course that guy probably expects 4-6k out of it by the way the ad was written.

RX7,fafqunx,t3_e8n6af,1576029593.0,"It's possible, but unless you have a decent background in electrical/computer engineering, the short answer is no.

There used to be a company called Rtek back in the day that chipped the ECU and allowed for some customization of the stock ROM, but it was very little, this was mostly for Turbo II owners, it existed for N/A but like I mentioned, the tangible gains for basic bolt ons are not very much for non turbo cars. 

&#x200B;

These cars are already becoming more difficult to find, please don't enforce the stereotype that drifting carries by building or treating the car poorly, or damaging it. 

&#x200B;

Assuming full proper bolt ons, the only realistic way to tune it would be to go to a standalone. Microtech and Megasquirt are antiquated, and imho were never that great to begin with. I believe Adaptronic and Apexi's Power FC will work on non turbo models, but again, don't expect huge gains. These EMS' are also upwards of $1,000+USD

&#x200B;

N/A rotaries hit a wall fast, and the only way that can be solved is with porting (waste of time and money, imho, shortens engine life and ruins drivability, unless it is a complete track car and you have the budget for it) or going forced induction. Any NA turbo kits have long since been out of production (in my time of being involved with RX-7's, I've seen one commercial turbo kit come up for sale second hand.)

That would leave a Jspec Turbo II swap, and those motors need to be rebuilt at this point given how long they have sat, assuming they weren't blown when they went into the junkyard to begin with.

So long as the engine is healthy and the battery, plugs,wires, and coils are in good shape there isn't anything to worry about.

Driveshaft length, coolant hose length/shape, and clutch line plumbing are just some of the mechanical and physical aspects that would need addressing. 

&#x200B;

Assuming it gets installed and mounted in the RX-8 chassis, you have to then worry about the electronic side of things. The RX-8 is a significantly more recent platform in terms of communication standards. While Both are OBD-II, the advancements made to the OBD-II architecture and the differences between the NB and the RX-8 are pretty significant. 

&#x200B;

The RX-8 utilizes CANbus for many of its communication features. Virtually everything is controlled by or interfaces with the PCM. ABS pump, EPS, instrument cluster, it's all tied together. Even changing some components between RX-8's is a chore, because if ABS pump A is programmed to car A, putting it in car B will result in a communication issue, it'd have to be reprogrammed.   

You'd be faced with trying to retain the factory PCM for all the chassis functionality, but it won't control the NB engine, nor will any part of the harness connect to it, and the NB Ecu will run the engine, sure, but it won't interface with anything on the RX-8 at all, so you are essentially at an standstill without making some serious sacrifices to almost everything electronic, which even in itself would require a custom harness and a custom EMS. 

&#x200B;

I mean sure, you could tear virtually everything electronic out of the car and just run the NB engine  and a custom EMS with custom gauges, but at that point you'd have nothing but a bare shell track car that is significantly slower than either car in its natural form.  You'd be better off taking the RX-8 and buying a longblock in known good condition, that's assuming the car has all of its original peripherals present aside from the engine and transmission, there wouldn't be any programming issues there, assuming its a Manual to Manual engine of the same series. 

&#x200B;

You could just pull the engine and transmission out of the miata and buy a miata shell, that would probably be the most inexpensive route."

Sidenote: the state apparently went to it's own system for determining instate or out of state status for tuition.  Previously, each individual university decided it (which is why I got shot down, despite my evidence and years of being here.)

RX7,f8xhd0r,t1_f8xfkgb,1574918815.0,"Well, just my opinion here, but:

I like the RX-8's unique style. Mazda had about 11  years worth of safety regulations to address in this country when the RX-8 hit the market, and I'd say given the cards they were dealt, they ended up with a pretty good design.

&#x200B;

It has more touring qualities in it, the suicide doors accessible rear seats, the available leather interior with heated front seats, etc.  If you look at the car with all the modern amenities exposed (rear doors open, cup holders open, storage compartment open) It looks like a grand touring car with a sporty feel to it, but just as easily you can close the suicide doors, push the cover over the cup holders, slide the center console forward, and now you have a streamlined interior that has less interior distractions and a focus that a more pure sportscar would have, despite it not having a hatch, and instead having a trunk, as well.

&#x200B;

Mazda's engineers really went to work to showcase the rotary aspect of the car as well, everywhere you look at the car there is something that reflects it, the headlamps have a small triangle cutout in front of the main bulb, the rotor accent on the front and rear bumper cover, the rotor shape indentation on the center of the hood, rotor shaped shift knob, etc. I like how they retained the central tach and stuck the speedometer right in there digitally as well. You can get an RX-8 in decent shape for 3k+ now, and with PCM based tuning more advanced than it was ten years ago, forced induction on a Renesis is pretty do-able.

&#x200B;

As far as the FD goes, I like it for the exact opposite reason of the eight almost. It's a timeless design, exotic in its own form, no backseats (in the USDM versions, anyway, rear seats were pretty standard in the JDM.) A good amount of space in the rear hatch, a near cockpit like feel and seating arrangement with everything angled towards the driver.  All of the auxiliary switches (foglights, rear defrost) are positioned just south of the shifter boot, giving an almost cockpit like feel when you move your hands to engage them. Mazda actually drilled the brake and clutch pedals out to save grams (yes, grams) of weight out of the total amount of the car. Everything they did to make the RX-8 have its touring aspect while being sporty, while with the RX-7 it is a no compromise sports car, Doesn't even have a tilt wheel.

The FC coils are known to be pretty robust in terms of longevity, in fact, some FD owners used to swap to them. 

&#x200B;

In the RX-8 world, people often upgrade coils even in stock situations because the OEM revision A&B coils are known to lose reliability at around 30,000\~ miles. I own an RX-8 as well, I can confirm this, coils are essentially a maintenance item unless you have the revision C coils, or IGN-1A's or LSX coils. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, getting sidetracked here. To fully utilize those coils on an FC you'd need an EMS (I'd personally go for Adaptronic modular, other ones are becoming antiquated at this point.)  Which is over 1,000 USD. So even after you are out the 1,800\~ for the coil set w/harness and the EMS, you still won't see any tangible gains, like I mentioned, even with tweaking dwell time.

Non turbo rotaries hit a huge wall when it comes to the quest for more power.  After basic bolt ons, outside of forced induction, all you can do is more porting, which compromises engine life and driveability the more and more radical you get with it.  My advice is, buy a jspec turbo motor and rebuild it and do a turbo swap.  Way easier said than done (especially on the wallet.)

Someone's going to end up buying a federally illegal car that was fraudulently imported, and there is a high chance if they are caught in possession of it, it will be either seized, or they will get hit with a forced order to export.   I'm willing to bet the dealer knows this, but I highly doubt they are going to go telling potential buyers. Anyway, that was my reasoning for the comment."
RX7,f5xf64a,t1_f5x87zz,1572539938.0,"I'd classify myself the same way, personality wise, anyway. The anxiety makes sense, I wanted to do Electrical & Computer engineering in my first tour of undergrad, and being 30 now and just going for it, it definitely has effected my anxiety because I feel like I should have accomplished it by now. 

""our future"" vs ""my future"" makes sense, i was fortunate enough I suppose to build a base auto S5 GTU to a five speed Jspec Turbo with my prior relationship. 

I was curious about the youtube/fame vs attracting the wrong type of girl, I guess you confirmed it, and it makes sense. As an engineer, I'll probably never be famous, but oddly enough, its crossed my mind that fame would really impede/effect myself finding a true relationship if I found myself in that situation, how would i know who to 'let my guard down' to, so to speak, and not get hurt because there are ulterior motives present? 

Also, apologies for not knowing this, but you're in the tech field, right? What's your alma matter?"

depression,f5x5f27,t3_dpky0i,1572535666.0,"Not a doctor here, but I can say from having been through the trial process of many of the SSRI's and SNRI's on the market, I can say I would never cold turkey those. Even if they are giving him no benefit, he is extremely likely to have a negative benefit by just stopping them abruptly. No benefit is better than a bad benefit, in my opinion.  I would taper off slowly. Suggest to him he ask his physician about this, but there's no such think as too slow, imho. slow enough, and he likely wont feel any negative effects, but that's just my opinion, again."

I would like to say I understand the pain you are going through, because I experience it everyday, and there isn't a single thing on the face of this planet that hurts worse, in my opinion. I love her and miss her everyday. I'm sure you know what that feels like.  This might not mean much, but, I figured I'd share, I really hope it works out between you two."

I'm curious, do you question if  the possibility of finding the right gal is difficult because of how well known you are? As in, potential relationships might come with ulterior motives from the other side?  Not to say all girls are like that, but I imagine if I was in a situation like that, I'd worry if it was genuine or if its because of my successes. Maybe that's normal to initially worry about?"
RX7,f5vh16e,t1_f5v6kl8,1572489143.0,"It's a sports car, not an economy car, so don't expect amazing fuel economy. Assuming the engine is in good shape, and is as up to date on maintenance as it can be (fresh oil change, fuel filter, air filter, plugs, wires, transmission and diff fluid, carb tuned correctly, tires correctly inflated, etc) and you drive it normally (not wot constantly from every stoplight, etc.) Expect probably 20\~ combined."
RX7,f5v4v89,t3_dpck54,1572483691.0,"I second what was just posted.  Being that the car has low miles, but it's obviously up there in age, it wasn't driven much. Compression test the engine, then look for parts that wear with age.  Obviously the car hasn't had the miles and hard driving on it, but things can go bad due to age and lack of use. 

Hoses, hoses, hoses. These will likely be your biggest culprit. That, and belts. Tires are likely to be older as well, though I highly doubt it still has the originals on them, that would be ridiculously unlikely. 

&#x200B;

If any hoses are swollen, leaking, or faded in color, change them. Do not wait for one to rupture, that can cost you an engine, or at the very least, time spent on the side of the road, or wherever it happened to rupture at, waiting on a tow truck. 

&#x200B;

My FD has 22,000 miles on it, and it is a great deal more recent, though still an older car, obviously. From it sitting, I had to replace the upper radiator hose, and belt, both of those gave out on me. At least an 80 SA is significantly easier to work on in most aspects."
