ptsd,fq1px46,t3_gfynye,1589047908.0,"PTSD is real, and can occur from any traumatic event. It can be debilitating unless/until it is treated effectively. There are many options for treatment and lessening of the effects - it is worth continuing to try different options until hopefully something sticks for you. Good luck."
Lyme,fp05z1e,t3_gajwdj,1588203117.0,I vote yes.
Lyme,fov4vr6,t3_g9oacc,1588095421.0,"I've had positives from Igenex for lyme, bartonella and babesia, though not all in the first testing round.  You gotta just keep testing over time as you go through treatment because as one infection gets less virulent another often starts growing more and then you can get the positive from the second one that was suppressed before, and so came up negative."
Lyme,fol5rfo,t3_g7yxd6,1587855426.0,"You can get the Stephen Buhner books, and start to follow his herbal protocols and see how you respond.  Start very slowly and work your way up.  I started with the Buhner protocol for 6 months before I even went to my first lyme doc. appointment, though I knew from Igenex testing I had had my internist do that I was positive for both lyme and babesia.  So, I started treating those first.  Eventually from my testing with lyme doc found out I also had 3 more infections.  Buhner protocol works.  He has a list of places to order herbs at the back of his books."

Lyme,fn7nj1s,t3_g030ii,1586723875.0,I have had minor. nosebleeds ever since I started treatment for both babesia and lyme.
Lyme,fmx4k9e,t3_fxtehu,1586458340.0,"As one other person wrote, if you develop increased symptoms on the herbal products, then you are likely herxing as you kill off infection, and you will know you are on the right path.  Some of the herbals treat multiple infections, so you will want to start with herbals that are pretty specific for one infection and get a sense of a response indicating you have that infection before moving onto herbals specific for a different type of infection, reserving for last herbals that treat multiple infections.  If you start with herbal treatment, you may also provoke the infections into your bloodstream where they were previously lying low, and in future testing you may get more accurate results.  I would just start with VERY low doses, like with even one drop to begin with, because if you are very toxic, just that one drop could send you into extreme symptoms.  My son had to approach bartonella starting with 1/3 of a drop of houttuynia, but now is at almost 30 drops plus antibiotics.  Just titrate up slowly as your body can handle.  The treatment can be very difficult but you will feel so much better at the end of it if it turns out you do have infections needing treatment.  And don't forget that you might also need to add in antibiotics to supplement the herbals to get full remission - we needed to do that.  Just work forward slowly with a careful and precise treatment plan, and take notes of what you feel. physically and mentally at each step."
Lyme,fm9o65t,t3_fr9uxc,1585872819.0,"My son had exactly the same symptoms after he got bitten by a tick, and after 8 months and a positive lyme test, plus lyme treatment that did nothing, he tested positive for bartonella and started intensive treatment for bartonella.  That started us on the path to healing, and for the neurological and digestive symptoms to resolve.  The digestive symptoms turned out to be neurologically caused.  As the bartonella resolved over the course of many years, we were able to more directly attack both lyme and babesia, but for my son, the bartonella has been the most dangerous infection.  We have had to use both Buhner herbs and antibiotics to get him into remission - on just antibiotics he relapsed a number of times, and we ran out of good, safe options for treatment."
