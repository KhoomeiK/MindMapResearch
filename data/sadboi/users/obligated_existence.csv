I'm constantly amazed by the quality of levels I find from people in this sub, but this might be one of the coolest levels I've ever played. I especially liked your take on the Dream Land stage, and how you represented the wind that Whispy Woods blows using the conveyor belt/P-switch setup. It was subtle, but a nice touch.

As far as constructive feedback goes, I agree with what others have told you about the final stage. Personally I didn't have much trouble figuring it out, but that's probably because I knew what to look for beforehand from this post. I can definitely see how some players might just scratch their heads after beating Bowser, and jump off the sides to their death trying to figure out what to do.

One other piece of feedback I have is about the Break the Targets minigame. I really liked how simple and clear the objectives were, and it was fun to use some of Link's abilities in unusual ways. But I felt like it didn't quite feel like Break the Targets, since it was slightly more focused on puzzle solving as opposed to just ""jump here, whack the target."" But maybe that's a good thing.

Depression - this is by far the least stigmatized of my conditions, and of mental health conditions in general from what I've seen. But that's only thanks to a *lot* of public awareness work that has been done over the years, and the progress has happened very slowly. But the good news is, depression is not heavily stigmatized or misunderstood in society as a whole anymore, although there are still plenty of individuals who misunderstand it.

OCD - somewhat stigmatized, and completely misunderstood. This is the condition that causes the most suffering in my life, both day to day and over time. OCD, for me, is hell, it's an indescribable and inescapable agony that results in me being suicidal a majority of the time. But most people don't think of OCD that way, people think of it as a sort of quirk or something, not a living nightmare.

Pedophilia - this is probably the *single most stigmatized mental health condition in existence.* And it's significantly misunderstood as well, and lucky me, I have to live with it. Fortunately, it's actually the least problematic of my three diagnoses, it doesn't affect my life too much, and a lot of the problems that come with it are more from the stigma rather than the condition itself"
