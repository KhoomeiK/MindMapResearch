Throughout the whole time they mention god and I wouldn’t say much about it, I stay in the fine line haha. But thank you, I just don’t want to be rude. They were really nice people but I would rather keep it business professional especially since we do not know each other. I read tour story and that does sound like it would be pretty awkward and I didn’t think people would invite strangers to church in business environment. I’d only go to church if it was for a spouse or if I found something on my own. Haha yeah tbh I think it would be awkward, I don’t think I will go, but do you think I should tell them that or just leave it as is? I don’t recall accepting I was just like thank you and trying to move on quickly. Again thank you for taking the time to reply!"

love,fkut4ia,t1_fktat1m,1584555643.0,"I feel like it’s too late to find old fashioned love, love in today’s world has no meaning. People in this society have ruined the meaning of love. Love isn’t what you take from the person but what you give because you give to those whom you love. I agree with you too, people don’t fight anymore. They would rather drop everything and find someone else. People care too much about their own feelings and never consider the other person and how they feel. I cannot take social media, it’s making everyone stupid. Also those attention seekers are annoying, I can’t stand people in my age group. It explains why I’m interested in someone 2x my age."

I’m not sure how I’d ask her out especially when she knows that I know she got asked out.. we work together and there is a age gap by like 20 years but I’m not bothered by that at all. But yes hopefully I will find someone eventually, I kinda want to move to another place and start a completely new life and have a fresh new start to meet people."

I thought I might have found someone cause I did feel a little something but I guess I was wrong because someone asked her out a couple days ago and she seemed a little excited, I know she’s on some dating apps too so idk I wanted to ask her out that day but he beat me to it.

I could say to you that there is someone out there for you but if this was the person you were set on then it might be harder to find someone else who you will feel a connection with. But time will help a lot, my suggestion to you is to distance yourself. I know that’s really hard to do too especially when it’s someone who you love but it will only hurt more.."

CougarsAndCubs,fkizf9k,t1_fkiu5g6,1584232299.0,Ooh yeah for sure I understand now. I do enjoy her company as well like she’s a funny person as well and I can be myself as well. That’s true as well I wouldn’t hangout with most of my co workers tbh. Thank you so much again! I might ask her if she wants to go get drinks tonight.
CougarsAndCubs,fkipk8u,t1_fki7j2m,1584225582.0,How do you tell the difference? A couple days ago we were in the car she was wanting to buy and I was just being goofy and like singing and dancing in the car and she started to laugh and then she was like fuck if I’m going to get this I laughed but idk I kinda took that in a positive way. Yeah I just like to be as nice as I can to her and I just try to make her laugh and show her I care for her but I try to keep it so no one else catches on haha. But thank you I appreciate that very much! I have thought about it a lot and I find myself thinking of her even when I’m not around her. I find it shocking for myself to have feelings for someone who is much older than me and having children. I am curious on how people might react but I also don’t care at the same time tbh.
CougarsAndCubs,fki08q2,t1_fkgue75,1584209298.0,"First thank you so much for your comment! Yeah I would understand losing my job if it had any sort of negative confrontation however, with my managers and owners of the place I work at8 have a pretty good relationship with so I’m not too worried about that.. that’s awesome how the VP was able to have that situation work out. If something between us was to happen I would want us to stay professional at work. That’s my concern too, we have known each other for a couple months now but we have been starting to become closer over these past couple weeks so we are together more. I think she laughs cause I’m funny, I’ll tell a joke and she’ll laugh. We’ve had some pretty good moments together too so I think that helps. I have a bad time reading signals I don’t know for sure or how to tell. I think I should wait a little bit and take it day by day and if the opportunity comes up then I’ll take it but I still want to go out with her for drinks and stuff so I will definitely do that to kinda test the waters a little bit. But you’re right I should mention I do like older women which I typically do not but this one is something else. We have mentioned our age differences but we blow it off cause to me it doesn’t much matter cause I like her for her personality."
CougarsAndCubs,fkhk4aq,t1_fkgyjv0,1584200591.0,"Exactly that’s what I’m saying, idk I think I’m willing to take the risk. I don’t even like my job and I have back up plans so if things go sour I won’t get screwed"

CougarsAndCubs,fkgc6gj,t1_fkgbe5k,1584155471.0,I can definitely see that however in my workplace that’s not uncommon. There’s people who I work with who are married or is dating someone there. I just thought maybe it would be worth giving a shot

askwomenadvice,fkfns75,t1_fkfl7h0,1584138542.0,"I like that idea, she has asked about getting drinks before so perhaps I’ll invite her.

askwomenadvice,fkfjrzl,t1_fkfjc7f,1584135959.0,What’s a good way to test the waters to see if there might be a mutual interest? She jokingly said I’m a older guy in a young guys body. Probably didn’t mean a thing but it caught me a little off guard.
careerguidance,fjdzgsd,t1_fjdwiou,1583262241.0,"I was feeling confident in the beginning but with all the people I saw and didn’t sell to it makes it harder for me to think this is something I’m going to be successful in. How do you stay at it with a positive attitude when you get more rejections then you do making a deal? I do like the idea of reading negotiating and learning more sales techniques. It’s more of the awkwardness I feel with the customers. I had a lady who bought a car from me and I liked her and she said I was the best salesman she’s ever had ( hard to believe) but i thought it was funny that she said I looked like I was uncomfortable and didn’t like doing sales. We were talking about me being new and that’s when she said that. But I am young, I don’t know what I want to do and I don’t know how to figure it out either."
careerguidance,fjdyinp,t1_fjdwboq,1583261710.0,Thank you for the reply. I understand that sales has its highs and lows but it doesn’t help when people are saying are trying to push me to do 15 units this month. I do appreciate the advice on using it as a growing opportunity I’ve definitely seen where I need some improvement. But I will try to keep my head up and focus more on the customer and do what I can to bring in the deal. I just feel really awkward with the customer sometimes cause I’m trying to figure out what to do and what to ask. I know the questions I need to be asking but it’s hard when customers aren’t being easy to talk to.

The poems I write help me since it allows me to get all my emotions and feelings out. Sometimes it hurts to read them again because I feel the pain in each of them.

I felt that the moment I laid my eyes on her when we had to go pick up a trade and we got it from an old guys house who was giving her a hard time about stuff and his trade was full of his crap and we had to help him get the stuff out so we could take is p.o.s  and I remember looking at her and she was sweaty cause it was in the summer and it was got, her clothes were dirty, her hair and makeup was messy and I just thought she was the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen.

How could I would be to her. I’ve tried many times to try and move on from her, I tried finding someone else but I don’t get the connection from other women than I do about her. I don’t want anyone else, she’s the only one I want to be with. I know I can’t change how she feels but and I have to respect how she feels but I can’t take it how she confuses me. One moment wanting to always be around me and talk to me, show affection but not want to be together and only be friends. When she said we can’t be together and I asked her why she only gave me bogus reasons. I told her we can keep things away from work, I told her that no matter if we date or not it will change the way we are and affect our friendship because she said she didn’t want to risk it. People say I need to move on, need to find a job or move away to be away and move on. But I can’t.. I can’t leave her.. It hurts.. she’s away on vacation and I haven’t seen her for 2 days and I miss her. We haven’t spoken and I just want to ask her how she is. Make sure she’s doing good and having a good time. But yet I think she hasn’t made an effort to do the same for me. I guess I’ll have to see how this week goes and how things are when she comes back. But do you think I should still show her?

My heart says I need to stay with her, be there with her so I can be there when needs someone so when she needs someone to hold her while she cries and comfort her and give her support and lift her up when she is feeling down. You’re right I want to do that, how do you think I should do this? I don’t even know what to say.. Maybe I should show her what I wrote her and so she can see that when I tell her I love her I mean it. With all of my heart. I should also mention she was drunk when we kissed and she said all those things to me this last week. She said it was a mistake. I felt like shit after she said that. It’s what changed my world and made it go upside down. To think I was going to be with her to think what we had was real and it was going to lead us to be happy together and I can do what I want and be treat her the way she deserves to be treated which is the absolute best. Everyday I see her I always make sure she’s okay and I say stuff to her so she feels good about herself and is motivated to get through the day and do what she has to do so she can make good money.

I thought she was saying sorry because she just wants it to come to an end and just move on.

More than a year ago she was in a relationship and so was I. ( felt guilt about it) but then I broke things off with who I was with and have been single for a year. We work together and a few months ago she came back to our job and she was single, we started seeing each other more often and she’d call me every morning asking if I want to get coffee with her before work and then she’d call me throughout the day like 10-12 times ( not joking people who work with me see the calls) and we’d see each other. We get lunch and we pay for each other. We flirt and she’s very touchy with me. But before she came back to our job and she was single we hooked up. She knew I liked her then, I never told her but it was always obvious but she still knew. But fast forward to this past week. We had a company Christmas party. I picked her up from home and we went, later when she wanted to go she called me to meet me at the car so we can go. I went to my car and she didn’t see me but I saw her and her ex which before I didn’t think they were talking again. She told me before the party how she talked her ex and he wasn’t sure about her cause of her and I. Anyways so she was with him for maybe 10 minutes then she eventually came to my car and we left. I was feeling crushed and I was quite. She kept asking me what was wrong I told her nothing. She asked me more and more times and I said nothing. I didn’t want her to know but before I knew it we ended up going to these docks and we talked and we had deep conversations and I was holding her and she cried we ended up kissing and then words were said from her and I thought maybe she wanted to be with me. I asked her why we don’t date and she said because of people we work with and I was like that’s bs and debunked all her reasons which were bogus reasons. Anyways next day i tell her she needs to make up her mind on what she wants because I can’t keep getting led on, since she’s been doing that for a long time. But anyways she says we can’t be together, she wants to be friends. I told her it doesn’t work like that I can’t keep being around her as much and do the things we do. It’s been 3 days since I’ve talked to her, I’m so hurt but I still love her. She’s said I’m sorry countless times and I told her the amount of times you say you’re sorry it doesn’t do anything, if anything it makes it less of an apology and more of okay get over it and let’s keep doing what we are doing. I told her I regretted kissing her and i should have never did it, she shouldn’t have ever did it and she said I know it was a 1 time thing but she’s been playing with my feeling for so long now. I’m not even mad at her, but it’s hard for me to talk to her or see her now.. I don’t know what to say anymore.. I want to be with her and even throughout all the bs I will always choose her over anyone."

So I wrote why I loved her on here. I want her to see it, I want to be there when she does but I’d have to wait a week since she’s away on vacation.

depression,fc70h97,t1_fc6weh1,1577494254.0,"thank you so much for your comment I appreciate your kind and supportive words! I do like reddit because It allows me to be open with this kind of stuff because In the real world I’m very closed off. I also thank you for saying I have done something right because all I feel is I keep making the wrong decisions. It’s really crappy how life throws us these rough times and I know it’s apart of life but it’s something so hard to do and from hearing what you’ve said you are also strong and I’m happy to hear even despite what’s happened to you that you are  grateful to be alive! I should have more of a positive mindset like that and sometimes I do have some hope but before I can get going again something happens and I’m back to where I was. I am trying to sort things out and it’s really hard especially because I feel like it’s tearing me apart. I work with someone I have really strong feelings for and this person knows it. There’s a lot to this story but basically things happened this past week and I’ve had enough of the playing with my feelings game so I had to say I need to be away from you. This person doesn’t seem to get it or not taking me seriously but it sucks so much to let someone go who you care for and actually do love. Never felt this way for anyone and turned down many chances of being with someone else because I wanted to be with this person. It’s hard to be away from this person when I work with them which is 1 reason why I want to get a new job because I won’t be able to move on if I keep seeing the person and being with them often. It just hurts to know someone you value so much doesn’t care for you and even though this person mentioned they did I just don’t see it. I even opened up to this person about what I’m going through and I regret it. I wish I didn’t. I don’t know if I should let this person go or keep them but I have a picture of what the outcomes would come to and they are not good at least what I think. I also want a new job because I want to generate more money and be able to achieve the goals that I have but with things going they way they are I just don’t know if I can do it. I do not feel good enough for anything anymore. I’ve lost my confidence in myself and I don’t even know who I am anymore or what’s even fake or real anymore. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare and living in my personal hell. Maybe I’m being dramatic but that’s how I feel when I think about these things. Like a prisoner locked away and trapped, never seeing daylight again. I’ve tried the medications for about 2 weeks now and tbh they are not mine they are a friend of mine but they offered me some to see if it would help which I thought they did for a couple days but now I’m seeing they aren’t since I am still feeling the same as before. But thank you again for your comment and support! It means a great deal to me!"
heartbreak,fbx58su,t1_fbx4waz,1577169898.0,I think it’s horrible people would do that to someone. Especially you do so much for them and they stab your back.. but yeah it’s nice to hear from real people and relate to someone or they relate to you.
heartbreak,fbx4nwj,t3_eex93l,1577169201.0,I understand how it feels to be used.. I’ve just now come with the realization that I can’t be with this person anymore because she uses me and cares only about her and doesn’t consider my feelings. You wouldn’t ever think the person you love and claims loves you would do this to your heart and to be so selfish.
askwomenadvice,fbuktx6,t1_fbujdf1,1577116106.0,"That’s pretty low of a person to do that.. but thanks again for your words of advice. It definitely has helped me, I’m hoping I can heal fairly easier after."
askwomenadvice,fbubwbs,t1_fbtqaak,1577111644.0,I don’t get why she cares so much in knowing who I’m talking to and what we are talking about. I told her it wasn’t her business but after asking 4 more times she gave up. But you’re right and I do need to start making strong boundaries and enforce them. It’s pretty heart breaking to me about this and I feel like I’m being torn up. I don’t want to see her or talk to her anymore cause I feel like I don’t have the energy to keep going. I might have to pull a Jim halbert and move locations.
askwomenadvice,fbtmk6c,t1_fbtm257,1577084916.0,I’m trying to avoid conflict but honestly I’m just about ready to ask her what she wants from me. It’s very confusing to me and yeah it’s going to be really hard and she’s really great in all honesty. She’s been there for me and I’ve always been there for her. She stole my heart even when I was with someone else. I’ve been single for a year and turned down other potential partners because at the end of the day I want to be with this women. But I thank you for your support and your advice! It’s been a very rough time and even with weed and anti depressants I’m still feeling miserable. We are both in our early twenties and I wish she’d be an adult and straight forward instead of playing middle school high school games.
askwomenadvice,fbtlcfq,t1_fbtkn6g,1577083378.0,You’re right on setting boundaries and that’s something that I need to work on. I let it go for so long because I enjoyed being with her and I had hope maybe things might work out and I didn’t want it to come like this. I don’t want to lose her in my life which hurts the most since I know the best thing for me is to let her go.. I just don’t get how people can be so selfish and feel they can play with others feelings and use them.
askwomenadvice,fbtergm,t1_fbtd3c0,1577076420.0,Also something weird to is that she is always wondering who I am texting and what we are saying. I find it pretty strange for a friend to ask that to another friend.
askwomenadvice,fbte0kx,t1_fbtd3c0,1577075762.0,"I agree and that’s what I want to do, I know as soon. As I start saying no to getting lunch, coffee before work and all the times she calls to see me she will ask me what’s up. She did that the first time so how do I respond without it getting out of hand again? Or do you think regardless it will?"
depression,fbmuxo9,t1_fbm6069,1576989175.0,"I feel you completely on that. People give you all this advice and they have all these ways “ tools” to help us feel better but as for me it’s never helped. I still feel sad, empty, lonely, and just over with life. I wouldn’t care if I was to die now. You’re not alone on how you feel. I’m sorry you have to suffer through this shit too."
askwomenadvice,fbl2cec,t1_fbl1cuu,1576957640.0,We work at a car dealership and our company has 2 stores next to each other but I might go to the one she doesn’t work at and switch departments so I can work there. I love my company and I have friends here so it would be hard for me to change them but at least I won’t see her very much. But no need to apologize it’s my fault for being stuck on her for this long and letting it get to the way it is. But what would you say to her tho? I don’t know what to say that will make it so there’s less tension. The last thing I need is more drama. But I agree It isn’t right and I don’t get why some people would be so selfish enough to do it.
askwomenadvice,fbl0uq1,t1_fbkznww,1576957250.0,You’re right and I agree with you. I think the best way to do that is to change workplaces. I’ve tried many times to move on and cut her off but I always end up in the same spot. No need to apologize but your words of advice are most definitely appreciated! It hurts but I’m sure over time I’ll be okay just as long as I’m away from her.
askwomenadvice,fbkxiqv,t1_fbktie9,1576956316.0,What would you do if you were in my shoes? I know if I want to be better I need to cut her off but at the same time I’m happy when I’m with her. She does make me happy but I can’t keep having my emotions toyed with.
depression,fbkkw05,t3_edpkii,1576951912.0,I’ve been feeling like I have been at my lowest for awhile now and one thing I’ve noticed is that I’m a lot more angry and bitter towards people. I’m not trying to take it out on anyone it just comes out.
askwomenadvice,fbk2p65,t1_fbiyreg,1576943872.0,That’s exactly what my friends have said about her too. She said she likes me but we can’t now we are friends and she doesn’t want to ruin that. But it doesn’t matter because it will affect the friendship either way no matter if we date or not. But she doesn’t get that nor was she understanding when I told her I want to be friends still but I don’t want to keep doing all the stuff we have been doing or at least not be around each other all the time. It’s frustrating as hell tbh but I don’t want to make things weird at work or anything. She’s been there for me when I needed someone since I’m going through depression and have been feeling at my lowest for some time now. I just wish things were different.. but thank you for your advice! But what do you think I should say to her? How can I word it that would get it into her head without her flipping out on me.
