DestinyTheGame,fitx73y,t1_fitve3n,1582731288.0,How often are you using it in end game content? If not at all then not much is changing. There will always be an end game meta and i'd rather that be new items from new seasons than old weapons. Keeps everything fresh and actually desirable to get.

How long will people be using recluse until it is eventually powercreeped? A year to play around with weapons and armor before they are no long end game viable is fine with me."

* What do you think about the artifact system in general?  
In theory it's a great idea, a steady pace of progression to unlock more and more powerful mods that fit either a certain playstyle or provide means to deal with certain mobs like anti-barrier mods and the like. But in practice it's clunky and very stale. Champion mods only working on certain weapontypes which limits us in our builds, being forced to use 2 primaries in your first 2 slots feels like vanilla destiny 2 all over again and we know how much we hated that system. Let us slot the champion mods on any weapon we want, hell staggering an unstoppable champion with a rocket launcher sounds pretty fitting dont ya think. I would also like to see these mods have a seperate slot on weapons (exotics included bungo pls) so that we can still use other mods. Having an entire bracket dedicated to glimmer and material feels... mehh... I think most people will skip these mods for other better choices. Void battery is a very good mod might I say a little broken in pvp. This mod would be fine if there were other mods on the same powerlevel. Nobody is gonna use heavy finisher for 7 energy. All in all, it's a good step in the right direction and im excited to see what you come up with in the future.

* What do you think about the power bonus provided by the artifact and the way it resets each season?  
This is fine not much to say here. Gives us a reason to keep earning xp.  

* What are your thoughts on ""resetting"" the artifact and the cost to do that?  
It doesn't cost that much anyway and the option should be there if you unlock a mod that you end up not using very much.  
 
* What is your feedback on the Season of the Undying artifact - which mods did you most enjoy/not enjoy?  
I really liked the voidgrenade debuff mod (cant think of the name) Maybe it was too strong but why can't we feel powerful? I think this mod was fine for what it was. Arc battery was an obvious busted mod but I enjoyed using it nontheless. This was an outlier and only good on hunter because of their fast-to-use class ability and in combination with wormhusk crown. This mod would have been fine if other mods in the same slot were as powerful or game impacting."
