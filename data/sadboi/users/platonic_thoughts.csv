relationship_advice,fo7m2bv,t1_fo7l0ll,1587580646.0,"Everyone may not think like I do, but to answer your question there is tons of productive things that can be done during this time. Tons of free resources online that can be used to learn a new skill, improve a particular skill set/craft, or just become more knowledgeable in general. So being lazy during this time doesn’t sit right with me, but to each it’s own. 

I commend you for helping with housework though"
relationship_advice,fo7kafn,t1_fo7jxga,1587579777.0,I’ve been thinking about letting her know. I’m just a bit fed up to even discuss it with her at this point as she becomes defensive when I do

Though I feel a lot more productive as well as a positive environment while using reddit. The biggest difference here on reddit is the lack of comparisons & the non existent urge to “keep up” with others. I’ve felt tons more productive and mentally sane"
mentalhealth,fk7kqw1,t1_fk6y1yl,1583938466.0,"I was a bit iffy about deleting my social media platforms exactly because of the reason you’re worried about. For me, “keeping up” with people tied with comparisons, also a huge loss of productivity on my end. How I’m seeing it now, the important and genuine people in your life that are worth keeping up with, should have no problem reaching out to you by phone or text, vice versa"
