Like today talking with someone and the second thing was something related to sex and from that this person kept persisting into asking sex questions. Nd tbh it's very sad to not be able to truly meet someone and have something when they're so shallow as you said. I think the perspective of what the people around them(knowing or not them) would say and that's where they dictate the decision and path of their life. Instead of focusing on what makes them feel special and loved and most importantly, respected. That's why I always say I'll treat anyone the way they treat me no matter how the look. If there's a connection people should give it a try. I would even drop friends/family if they moke my partner because if his height thb.

(Hope this doesn't come as offensive) but little kids when they have little siblings develop a strength of protection towards those who are """"weaker"""" or can't protect themselves towards the bad things outside. That feeling with time and depending of whether the person has self-esteem or not, can grow or disappear.
If you are negative towards a situation, no matter the height or weight or strength or anything, you'll be useless. That's why the attitude you show to the world it's what determine how people view you."
