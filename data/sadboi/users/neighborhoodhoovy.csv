Genre - romance, humor 

Link - [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13517631/1/Heart-of-Steel](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13517631/1/Heart-of-Steel)

Summary (not the one I actually wrote and this one sounds bad but whatever) - Kapkan has always been a loner. He wants to be alone, but that doesn't seem to be the opinion of others
