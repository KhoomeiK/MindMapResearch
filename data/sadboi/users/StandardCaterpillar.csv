Give your healthcare providers some credit.

ERs and non-coronavirus-facing urgent cares are seeing way lower volumes of cases because people like you are scared to go get checked out. People are having heart attacks, strokes, getting sepsis, appendicitis, kidney stones, kids are getting ear infections and viral infections and stomach bugs all that at the same rate they were before and we're just not seeing them walking into ERs.
