askgaybros,eysez1c,t3_cyfo8j,1567395933.0,"I am 58 yo and the best advice I ever received when I was young was to go to the gym or take up a sport or some method of exercise.  Back then, the gym was not a big thing. 

I was intimidated by going to the gym as I knew nothing about the equipment or exercises... Now, you can YouTube it to learn.

The benefits come from feeling better due  to the exercise and from the confidence you get from looking more fit.  Also, I met a few friends at the gym... Never socialized with them outside of the gym, but it was great to just chat regularly.

Also, try something new - running, bowling, chess, etc.   Almost all endeavors have beginners groups.  Running was great for me... Ran local races, joined a group... And, you can run on your own until you feel confident. 

If you want to chat, feel free to DM."

Let me know if any questions.    I have been in insurance claims for 30 years."
