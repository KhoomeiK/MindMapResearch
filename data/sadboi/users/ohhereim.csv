&ref means the location address of the object that ref refers to and not the address of the ref itself

Also quoting from C++ Faqs  [https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/references](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/references) 

&#x200B;

> Unlike a pointer, once a reference is bound to an object, it can not be ""reseated"" to another object. The reference itself isn't an object (it has no identity; taking the address of a reference gives you the address of the referent; remember: the reference is its referent)."
