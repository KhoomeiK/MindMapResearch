I've (35F) been mismatched so far. 

I got either 

- Amazing sex and communication about it but not enough non-sexual touch. The sexual positivity from that Ex was very helpful as that BF was my first BF and sexual partner. But we'd have amazing sex, but he'd pull out and not touch me again. I would touch him in a non-sexual way all the time, but not him...

OR

- My last partner was so affectionate, we cuddled and touched non-stop but we didn't click sexually despite a lot of feeling and he didn't know what he liked and couldn't talk about it. It was mainly communication that ended it.

**I really want BOTH for my next LTR or FWB: sexual intimacy and non-sexual affection **

The other person doesn't have to be as touchy feely as me. And I will have to communicate as well, when I just want to cuddle, as I got a strong drive, so my partner would have to know that I don't want or expect sex whenever I get close. I just want touch often and sex every other say or so.

How did I process:

3 years ago i radically decided to choose myself. To accept myself fully. Body, mind and soul. Accepting me also helped accepting me wanting to leave, leaving and building a new life for myself. It means that I try to live authentically.

I talked a lot to my friends while grieving my LTR, I journaled, I build a life with work, friends and outings. I did a lot of introspection about what I want next and don't want. What are ""musts"" for a next relationship? What setup do I want? Etc.

Now with Corona I'm furnishing my apartment (my flatmate moved out in March) and am reading books on sex. I also bought toys and I'm trying to find out who I am sexually and who I want to be. I had my first orgasms the other week. Life changing!

I also built a lose friendship with my Ex immediately after leaving. This was at times emotional, as In had to grief him and build something new with him. I was over him around the start of the new year. 
Because of.corona we can't go out for lunch anymore but it's helped me to let him go further, as I don't see him face to face anymore... He's a good friend but as we split up due to communication issues as well, he's not my go-to person to talk to! And that's ok... But he's loyal, believes in me and is a decent person. We check on each other via text. I am glad we are on amicable terms and he always encourages me. I am grateful we are still a positive force in each other's life.

As to dating again/FWB:

The isolation has sped up the process and I might go out and date again in autumn or so.
A year ago I thought it would take me 2-3 years...
But no. Being alone so much gas sped thighs up. 
I'm ready to be held again, to be open, vulnerable and passionate. 

As long as I couldn't say that I was these 3 things, sex and dating weren't options for me (very personal choice!). How can I truly come in contact with a person if I am still in the past?

I don't judge anyone for whom this is different in any shape or form! But this has been my choice: I don't go out there until I'm open and ready again.

Does this answer your questions a bit? This is just my personal way of doing this. It's served me well. I am a passionate, eccentric and content person. But approaching this process in a slow, thoughtful and reflected manner has been really beneficial.

Feel free to DM me too!

Extra tips:
Be kind to yourself and do what feels right for YOU. Keep loved ones close. Ask for help. Make sure not to be alone on your birthday or Christmas unless you want to etc. Use the time to getting to know yourself anew. 

Being single at 35 has been perfect for me and really beneficial for my assertiveness, self-confidence and contentment."

raisedbynarcissists,fpede5l,t3_gcosqp,1588545313.0,"Thanks for making this post OP.

Both my adoptive brother and I became happy, well-adjusted people after an odyssea of a life. But that's  because we cherry-pickeed the few good things my parents did and went in the opposite direction on the rest of their action, morals and principles... which was the majority of what was given...

I have chosen to be emphatic, kind, non-judgmental and to build a life I'm content with. I don't want to be right at all costs and don't have to turn discussions into fights. I operate from a place of respect and compassion.

They disapprove of all of it and all of me. And that's ok I guess. As long as they don't try to ruin it for me (hence NC). 

I fully accept who I am these days. It's a raducal choice, and I take constructive criticism my friends on board, i self-reflect and try to do thr best I can. But I work WITH myself instead of fighting myself. I am human, with positive and negative sides and that's ok. I finally make choices for ME!

Not having them in my life has made a huge difference in my personal human experience of the world and living a life and finding contentment."

Or demand them. Whatever he wants to do or buy for my birthday or Christmas is up to him but to me that's just incomprehensible. Her making these comments... So a man had to buy a woman stuff? Wtf (I‚Äôm 35F btw).

And I'd rather have a card and a nice outing than some material gift. But say: ""You don't buy me enough gifts..."" I don't comprehend that sentence!

And I lived in a partner's house and am now, after the amicable split a year ago still grateful that he let me live with him!!!"
