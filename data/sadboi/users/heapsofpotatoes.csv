I knocked something over trying to reach awkwardly wayyy over her (she didn't move it closer or move out of the way as I was reaching) and as she started to compare what I did to something her young students would do for the second time that evening, I said ”haha cool” and left to pour myself a drink.

Sometimes in therapy I feel I'm ""zooming in"" on my therapist's face slowly and she is growing, which freaks me out. I'm not sure exactly what is going through my head when I feel this other than anxiety. Feeling like your surroundings are growing or shrinking for a few seconds with no control over it is scary! I'm pretty sure I've always had it every once in a while.
It seems to me like the feeling of ""the walls closing in"" caused by anxiety"

I buzzed part of my head and was super anxious because it was my first time using a buzzer and it freaks me out and it's a pretty bold haircut but I figured I'm working from home for who knows how long so to hell with it! Then my anxiety just skyrocketed and I realized that while I was cutting my hair my mom, who is probably the reason I have anxiety, called me and then called my husband when I didn't pick up. I know she's not gonna take my haircut well and I'm too anxious to interact with her (she ""doesn't know"" I have anxiety so she'll just assume there's something horribly wrong with me or that I'm on drugs) so I'm feeling kind of trapped and hoping to god she doesn't just show up and get into my building somehow. I keep hearing footsteps on the stairs outside my apartment and I'm just trying not to have a straight up panic attack right now.  
:( husband suggested going for a walk so I might just do that and say we went for a walk and left our phones at home. I will probably do that but for now I'm just trying to breathe. This is all so silly!!! Ugh."
