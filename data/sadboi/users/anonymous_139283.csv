depression,fkgnzo6,t3_fhu4s5,1584166490.0,"I refer to the way my personality changes like a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of whatever container it's put in, and I change my personality based on the situation I'm in. It's gotten so bad that sometimes, when people ask me what my hobbies are, I don't know what to say. Or when my friends and I play games like ""most likely to."" I'm never ""most likely to"" do anything. I'm always stuck in the middle. Because I don't have a real personality. This probably made no sense"

depression,fkeu4fj,t3_fi2nc5,1584120722.0,"I get this. Im in high school too, and my younger sister is around the same age as yours. I had no idea she was struggling until a couple of months ago when I saw her cut marks. She's always in her room watching TV or listening to music, never goes downstairs and plays like the other kids her age, and doesn't talk much at all. She sleeps at 3 or 4 am and wakes up at noon. 

My parents and I don't really know what to do. She's so sensitive that anything we say she'll take extremely personally, and my parents stopped talking to her about a lot  of things because they're worried they'll make something worse. It's frustrating because it doesn't seem like she wants to change and I don't know how to help her change. All we can do is take baby steps I guess. 

I found one thing that helps which is keeping her active. Playing card games with her even when she says no, or asking her to go out and play basketball. Or even just watching a movie together or me reading a book to her. After a bit she usually starts to get interested and have fun, and this usually tires her out enough so she sleeps at least an hour or two earlier than normal. And no matter how frustrated or tiring it gets, please do not stop talking to her every night. Just push it down as best as you can and make sure she knows she's loved. 

It's hard when someone so young has to deal with so much, especially when they're such a close family member. I'm sorry this is happening to your sister. I hope this kind of helped and that it gets better for you all soon ❤️"

depression,fkbmiij,t3_fhka6a,1584035755.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I know it's difficult to lose a pet. I hate when people act like animals make no impact on a human's life. Just know that you did the best you could for your dog, and that it's okay to grieve, despite what anyone tells you. You can get through this"
depression,fkbl56y,t3_fhj3wq,1584035015.0,That's a terrible stereotype. Men are allowed to feel pain and show emotions. It doesn't mean that they're weak. It just means that they're human. I'm sorry you're stuck in that place.

I'll probably try out playing music. It might help me feel a little more alive. I'll keep you updated for sure. Thanks for the help :)"

acne,fk8kkxb,t3_fgz204,1583957817.0,"I haven't tried much besides natural things since my parents aren't very willing to take me to a dermatologist. They keep saying my skin is just a ""phase"" and I'm making a big deal out of nothing. For me, the worst part is when something I don't know how to deal with shows up on my face. For example a couple of weeks ago I noticed some hyperpigmentation, didn't know what to do, left it alone, and now it's worse than before. 

And also whenever my friends complain about their ""terrible"" skin in front of me. Or when someone points out my skin."

Yeah probably is. Also when a new person is introduced into the friend group I immediately worry that I'll be left out or everyone will realize how boring I am and ditch me. Pathetic, I know"
