SuicideWatch,etwmhud,t3_cdr0xx,1563277211.0,"Honestly babe, fuck friends, live for yourself. Depression sucks, and its fucking hard and in no way is this living shit easy but there are people who care. They may not live near you but take the people of Reddit, I can guaruntee that any of them, me included, would 100% be there if you needed to talk. 
I guess what I'm trying to say is I hope you decide that living is worth it and if not then I hope whatever happens is peaceful and you are happy wherever you end up ‚ù§"
