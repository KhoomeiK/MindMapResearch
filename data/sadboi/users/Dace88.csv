If you stuck both of them in a side like Palace or Southampton, Milner would be as consistent as he is now and has been for us, where as Sterling would have moments of brilliance during long spells of invisibility.

If you're actively looking for something, be it sexism, racism, or any kind of hate really, you'll find it.

That doesnt mean its rampant or even the majority, it just means you're looking for negativity.

Edit - Thanks guys.

And just to add it was some of the hardest months of my life, and still is. Drugs and drink arent for everyone, and just because you can handle it doesnt mean you dont have a problem. Took me 15 years of abuse to realise that and honestly, if my fiancee hadnt gotten pregnant, I'd still be on everything. I started at 14 years old thinking it was harmless and a great way to pass time. Please dont fall for that like I did.

Obviously if you can do the whole moderation thing, alcohol and having a smoke shouldn't be a problem for you. I want to clarify that because I dont want to demonize anything like that. 

I'm just hoping that if this resonates with anyone, they can make a change sooner than I did. If 1 person can have a better life by learning from my mistakes then that's a good thing.

On the plus side, I'm now over a year clean, have an amazing and supportive fiancee, an absolutely beautiful 5 month old baby girl, and I'm still only 29! Plenty of life left to enjoy."
