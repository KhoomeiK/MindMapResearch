1. Have you looked at group therapy, or family therapy? It almost seems that she's using this perfume on purpose, knowing it's a trigger for you.  Maybe having a mediator, or someone in the middle that you and her can speak to to get these feelings worked out?
2. Have you been completely upfront with her about your problems? 18 is the age of adulthood, and sometimes, an 18 year old needs to see the reality of adult struggles before they realize it.
3. Is she going through anything right now that she's not sharing with you?  You're both adults now, it's time to stop hiding and burying things, and start coming together to support each other...and she's got to realize that's ultimately what needs to happen.

Maybe going to a sit down place (when COVID-19 decides to not be such a problem), and sincerely tell her that what she's doing is just making things toxic between the two of you will make her understand that she's gotta meet you half-way.

If she's the type to make a scene, take a car ride, and just lay out your problems to her... 

""I struggle with BPD, and there's no cure, no FDA approved treatment, and you doing this doesn't help me.  It would be like me doing <insert her trigger> to you on purpose, just to see you hurt.  It's not fair, and what you don't know, is that I've done <what you've done to help yourself and her> for you, and I really want you to understand the sacrifices I've made for you."""
BPDrecovery,fly81bi,t3_frqko7,1585597247.0,"I'm not looking to justify their actions at all - I too get gaslighted at work sometimes, and it's never a good feeling.

You should never, ever, ever, ever, ever, feel guilty about what you are struggling with.  We don't know the root causes of BPD, anxiety, depression, ADHD, bipolar, or any other mental disorder.  There's no ""smoking gun"" or specific root cause of any of the mental conditions that plague humans today.

However, perhaps gaslighting is the first reaction they have upon learning of your new diagnosis.  My mom tried to gaslight me when I told her that I thought I had ADHD, it went something like this:

>Mom: ""You don't have ADHD, you are just scatter brained, and need to slow down.""  
>  
>Me: ""But mom, I'm in the middle of an activity, and I start to question why I'm doing it, or if it's a multi-step problem, I'll forget why I'm doing a certain step, and lose sight of how it will help the overall problem.""  
>  
>Mom: ""That doesn't sound like ADHD.  You just need to slow down.  You're fine.  You don't want to be one of those people who's drugged up like a zombie.""

She finally accepted it when I had an official diagnosis from a medical psychiatrist, who when he heard my symptoms and struggles, wondered why I wasn't so persistent with getting my ADHD treated while growing up.

I know that it doesn't change the fact that you feel wronged when you experience gaslighting.  Trust me.  That feeling will never go away.  You'll start to wonder things like ""If my mom and dad would have just listened to me earlier, imagine what I could be today.""  That's the thoughts I get with my ADHD...and now my BPD diagnosis.

Here's the point I'd like to drive home.  You have one set of parents in your life.  One couple who loved each other enough to bring in such a wonderful person into this Earth.  Don't pass guilt or judgement to them...they'll never understand the struggles that you have to cope with.  And when you hold judgement and guilt against them, you miss out on the years you spend enjoying your parents' time here on Earth.

Instead, love them as your parents, the ones that stayed up with you when you were sick, didn't smoke or drink when your mom was pregnant, didn't drink diet soda because they didn't know the full effects on an unborn child.  They're still absorbing the real fact that you have been handed something that no matter what they did when you were unborn, you still have something that even they couldn't predict or prevent.  There's an unmeasurable amount of love that your parents have for you, and no book can describe it.

And ultimately (this is really important too) - I feel we become parents with the sole thought of doing better for our kids than our parents did for us.  When my son, or any future kids I have, comes to me and says they're having troubles focusing, or they're sad and they don't know why... I'll know I'm doing better than my always single divorced mom did for me, and get my child (or children) the help they need, so they don't ever have to feel the way I do now.

In order to help yourself, you have to forgive others for their shortcomings.  Otherwise, history will repeat itself."

When I was reading about bipolar ONE and bipolar TWO, my heart started to hurt for those who are experiencing these feelings.  People with bipolar disorders can't turn these feelings off, and of course, they rear their ugly head in the worst possible times.  With the loving support of others from places like Reddit, people who are bipolar, or maybe not bipolar, will understand the struggles that people with a bipolar diagnosis experience on the daily.

I've got a pair of Nike running shoes that were about $90... it was one of my many attempts to be healthy lol.

I love the thing you said about it being ""mental over physical"".  It's so hard to turn off the mental voice of ""what are you doing?"".

I also never thought of looking up proper form and posture for running.  I've just always went out and started running, and never understood how to be ""light"" on my feet, or what to do with my hands, how much I should swing my arms, etc.  This hopefully will help me with those concerns too."
running,fly1d55,t1_flxyskz,1585593741.0,"Thank you for being so supportive! There's been some subs that don't really welcome newbies, and I'm glad to see this isn't one of those subs!

And I really appreciate the patience you took to go through each of my qualms with running.  It really makes sense from what you're saying.  Maybe the people I talk to who have destroyed their bodies went ""balls to the walls"" and never took time to care for themselves.

My doctor basically told me in 2013, if I can do it and not have lingering pain for days after, it's good.  The pins are titanium and strong, and as long as I'm not jumping off cliffs and landing square on my feet, I won't bend or damage anything.

And I smiled when you said that even you don't find the rhythm until about 20 minutes in.  With roller skating, I know I have to take it easy for the first 15 minutes, otherwise, I'm not in the ""zone"" to keep rollerskating for hours.

And I think you pretty much nailed it with the ""Take things slow and appreciate the process for what it is.""  I guess it's like any hobby / sport... if you go level 10 out of the gate, you're going to become burnt out, and not enjoy it...because it equates to torture...and no one really wants to put themselves through torture.  But it looks like there's a level of respect that I need to show to the sport of running.

We've become a society of Nike sayings, ""No pain, no gain"" and ""Just do it"".  It's refreshing to see that *most* runners don't follow those sayings when it's meant to be a leisurely activity.  I'm in no way looking to be a marathon runner, or someone to break records... just something to keep my mind active, hopefully increase some dopamine and serotonin in the brain, and be more ""at one"" with my mental self, especially through the end of April quarantine that the President unveiled last night, as well as the months after April."

BPD,flaz6f4,t3_fnex1t,1584994096.0,"Friend, I feel like I typed what you typed.

I recently just looked up symptoms of BPD, and good Lord, are they eerily close to what I experience but never had a label for the feelings.  And what's worse, is when I do open up to someone, it's someone I should have no business opening up to... people younger than me, coworkers, friends, my boss...

I've tried journaling.  I always end up feeling so ashamed when I read what I typed a few days later.

AND I TOO feel like the people I open up to will just judge me, or I become a burden...or they look at me and say, ""Dude you got a lot of problems, I'm gonna go now.""

I also feel like I experience OLD (Obsessive Love Disorder).  It's where you basically want to be number one in a friend's life, and when you aren't, you start to pretty much self destruct and go to great lengths to earn the top spot in their life.  

Real extreme cases of OLD (which I don't have) include obsessing with who they hang out with, where they go, what choices they make in life.  

Minor cases of OLD (which I believe I experience) include going out of your way to ""protect"" their feelings or wants, constantly needing reassurance from them that your friendship is okay, or that you are a good person.  And making hasty conclusions with your own mind that ""they don't give two shits about me, why am I friends with them?"" when in reality, you're fabricating an invisible scenario and situation.

Any thing any one is doing to help them in their daily lives??"

It took me ten years to earn $56k.  Right out of college, that's a respectable starting salary.  The folks that make $100k are ones that have senority in their field, have been doing it for years, and most likely are key people in their company.  Don't sweat it."
personalfinance,fiqp6sm,t3_f99ma0,1582649062.0,"My math isn't the strongest, but if you pick up a part time job at $10/hr and you work 30 hours every two weeks, that's $300 gross, and say you pay 25% for taxes, you're looking at $225.  Tax refunds would be used to pay off outstanding debts on CC's.  Cell phones - well...$180 is the going rate unfortunately for any 2 lined wireless provider, and because they are such a necessity these days...that's an unavoidable expense in my opinion.

If you have a friend or family member that is looking to get out of their living situation and you have spare room in your place, maybe rent out a room and get some extra income? That's a very undesirable situation, but hey, any little bit helps.

Honestly, you seem as if you are in a *deep* hole, especially with the amounts on your cc's and the minimum payments you are making each month.  I mean, you could apply for a CC that has a no interest balance transfer promo and save money on interest.  Or a personal loan and consolidate all of your credit cards to that...and save money on the interest fees that each CC charges.  Don't charge any new monies to any credit card, obviously.

Cut the gym.  Downscale the internet.  See if your company offers work from home options to save on gas.  $500 a month in gas for your cars is outrageous, and that's the first thing I'd be looking to change if I were you, whether it be trading in your car for a more fuel efficient vehicle or whatever else.  Also, shop around for car insurance.  $280 a month is high, I only pay $150 a month for two vehicles (one financed), full coverage.

$500 a month for groceries is a lot too...but if you have lots of mouths to feed, yeah that makes sense.  Coupons, or Aldi.

Not to pry, but your spouse can't watch your kids while you work a second job? That's what I had to do to pay the $1200/month daycare for my little one.  When things get really sticky, I have to ask my mom.  She understands, since I've been fully transparent with how much things cost, and she's willing to help me out with sitting.

personalfinance,fiqk4in,t3_f8were,1582646020.0,"If you have had more than one job, leave it off, and then explain the gap with your school work.

Now if you have a bare resume, then sure, put it on, but have an answer in your back pocket to the question, ""How are you going to balance your work/school with this job?""

Also, depending on what state you are in, employers call other employers to verify that you worked there.  That's pretty much it.  No employer is going to put you on blast for working in a place for a month.  People quitting after a month is more common than you think."
personalfinance,fiqjevx,t3_f8tpj1,1582645592.0,"I'll tell you two things that I tell everyone I speak with:

1. God gives the toughest challenges to those who can handle them.
2. When you get through this hellish storm in your life, you will be a stronger individual than any other 17, 18, 19, or even an adult.  Your advice will be from the heart, and from experience.  And when / if you have kids, you will be able to make things right for them.

1) You kicked out at 18? Guess what.  You can file taxes on your own, so don't let your guardians claim you as a dependent anymore.  Their loss, your gain (depending on your state, you might get more federal return back).  That solves your financial aid issue and your parents making too much...they shouldn't claim you as a dependent if they aren't willing to roof your head.  Also, check to see if your company offers tuition reimbursement.  Sure, you'll have to pay it up front, but depending on how your place works, you can get a reimbursement for some or all of the tuition you pay at the end of the semester. (I got my associates degree with ZERO debt that way).  Depending on your state as well, you can claim your college expenses on your taxes and receive money back as well (been there, done that).

2) Breathe.  You could be ""borrowing trouble"" by stressing out about a ""more than likely"" thing.  Who knows, you might work stuff out between now and then.

3) Great call with the IT certs.  Look for a Helpdesk position to start, or depending on how strong you are with your dev skills, a Jr Dev position.  You are very fortunate that you're entering the IT field... it's ever growing and always changing.  If you do Helpdesk, try not to stay in the position for more than a few years - your goal is to get your foot in the field, and then use it as a stepping stone to another position (DevOps, SRE, Jr Dev, Dev, Sys Admin).  To continue your learning, I'd recommend Professor Messer (he has YouTube vids that go through a lot of tech stuff).  If its an internship, take it.  We just hired an intern for a junior dev spot.  He was pretty much a guaranteed, since he worked with pretty much every developer on our team.

4) As stupid as this sounds - Debt is temporary; your health and well being are permanent.  There are college students who go to a four year university, pile up close to $100,000 in student loans, get into the career field, and then find out that their passion isn't as ""in demand"" as they thought it would be."
