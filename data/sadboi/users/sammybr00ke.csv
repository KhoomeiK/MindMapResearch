I would 100% write down how you feel about them, the great qualities they have when sober and the great things they can/want to do. Then explain how hurt and sad you are that they are using and they will likely end up overdosing or getting locked up. And lastly offer to help in any way you can. Even if that’s just emotionally being there for them.

This will only work when they are ready to get clean. That’s why it’ll be good for them to have it written down, they can re read it when they’re thinking more clearly or considering getting help. But this will plant the seed and let them know someone is here for them and wants them to get help. So sorry you and your family are going through this.

-Sobriety! I spent over a decade using drugs or alcohol as a crutch to ignore my feelings. I finally feel like I can manage my moods and have some sort of control now that I am not relying on drugs or alcohol or having to deal with their consequences and hangovers.

-Therapy & self improvement! I am working the steps in NA and also see my therapist weekly. Having someone I can tell everything to and who will not judge me but only help and guide me is invaluable. Working thru my steps and following different “assignments” from my therapist to help me improve upon my main areas I need to work on has been amazing. I really feel like I am making some progress and becoming a better happier person.

Also just wanna second the whole sleep thing. I find myself wanting to rebel and stay up late especially when hypomanic. “Forcing” myself to get some sleep has never steered me wrong. I am always grateful the next day and will kick myself when I don’t get sleep."

bipolar2,fn6jpcm,t3_fzvwgg,1586701012.0,"Idk that is pretty odd in my experience. I was diagnosed a long time ago so I can’t be certain but am pretty sure I was diagnosed and prescribed low dose Lamictal(mood stabilizer) within the first appt. 

It especially does not make much sense to start you on a new SSRI without the stabilizer. I believe generally they will get you on a stabilizer first and then when titrated close to the goal dose they may consider adding an antidepressant as it is common to be on both. If you haven’t started the antidepressant maybe contact the doctor and ask why you would take something that in the past has caused mania. Either way definitely reach out to them and make sure this is necessary and ask if they could revisit this at the next appt. If they insist on waiting schedule something very soon like no longer than 2 weeks out if possible."

As far as contacting your old psych, I would try everything you can so please reach out to them and they may even be able to get you an appt locally or via telemedicine. I would also recommend not only trying to get an appt with any psychiatrist in your area but also with any primary/family doctor. They may be able to prescribe meds you have previously been on or even something new. It sounds like your life is at risk and I really hope you are able to get the help you need!

Regarding your friend, it sounds like this is causing enough pain that it is time to set some clear boundaries. Tell them what they are doing or saying that bothers you and either take a bit of a break from communicating all together or establish what you need them to stop doing or talking about. Maybe asking for no mention of mental health can help get rid of the resentment and pain this is causing you. It sounds like you value this friendship so it would be best for both of you if you are honest and just let them know how this is affecting you and that you care for them but need their help/understanding right now.

Hopefully if you can take the pill form longer the side effect may subside but only time will tell. I would also ask the pharmacy to send a refill request to the psychiatrist and see if maybe that works! Just an idea to buy some more time to see if this is the right med! Wishing you well!"
BipolarReddit,fmosy1c,t3_fwkrcm,1586267815.0,"Lamictal can take a while to work properly but for me it has been a total life saver. However I was on it by itself and definitely still had bad depression symptoms. I actually take Wellbutrin and Effexor as well as Lamictal now.

When taking antidepressants alone it can lead to mania or hypomania but when taken with a mood stabilizer the goal is that they will actually work properly. It has definitely helped me!

If you aren’t comfortable with your doctor you can always look into maybe getting a second opinion especially if they don’t already specialize in bipolar disorder. But if you’re willing to keep working with this doctor then it might be helpful to ask about using antidepressants in conjunction with the mood stabilizer (Lamictal)

If u have any questions pls let me know!"

NarcoticsAnonymous,fmokkeb,t1_fmnwhkn,1586261875.0,The do have these and most other fellowships on www.intherooms.org
notlikeothergirls,fmo267n,t1_fmntm74,1586242660.0,I saw they’re delaying shipping on non essential items but I’ve ordered like 4 things things since this has been happening and still ended up getting the items the same week!
notlikeothergirls,fmnnkuu,t1_fmnngl3,1586230335.0,Wow that’s scary! I figured I’d be safe from counterfeits since I don’t buy anything pricey.
notlikeothergirls,fmnjt8m,t1_fmnibq8,1586227714.0,Amazon is generally cheaper and keeps u inside
BipolarReddit,fmlaa6e,t1_fml9ypa,1586182280.0,"Honestly I’m not sure, I think it’s just talk therapy but she also does CBT. I haven’t really discussed whether a call will be an option yet so it may not be. So far all we have done is my intake with all the questions and then we just had a session to discuss some other things going on and what my goals are for the next few sessions."
BipolarReddit,fmksnee,t3_fvuplx,1586167088.0,I just started going to therapy and only got to meet her in person one time. I think that session went really well and we clicked and I was comfortable talking with her. Then on my zoom session the internet was making it all choppy and delayed so it was difficult to understand each other. Plus in the back of my head I was uncomfortable knowing my roommates could likely hear us. I think I’ll ask to do our next session via phone call to avoid at least one of the issues.
BipolarAndSober,fmjx0tc,t3_fvp0vz,1586139452.0,Congrats! I’m so proud of you and wish you all the best going forward!
