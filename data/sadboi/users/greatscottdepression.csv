but at the same time, after mentioning it over and over again, you should've got the hint that maybe she's comfortable with the clothing she has now, and she's probably a little worried as to why you're obsessed with your brothers girlfriends clothing! 

overall, i wouldnt say you are for sure TA, but you seem kind of ignorant!"

yes, i understand the competitiveness and seriousness of gaming. i'm currently pregnant and my fianc√©e and i LOVE gaming a lot. but he understands what i need from him, and i understand what he needs from me. and i understand unwinding after a long day from work with friends, that's not a horrible thing, but the way you worded EVERYTHING? yeah, you're for sure the ass. you have less duties around the house then your wife, and you obviously have a superiority complex because you ""provide more"" for your family. 

her threatening divorce wouldn't be right in a normal context, but if she has to deal with you daily? i'm surprised she hasn't been meaner."

I know it sounds stupid, but growing up looking like me (to reiterate, I was fairly chubby, had an emo haircut and I'm just devastatingly average), I relied emotionally on the thousands of strangers and their attention. When I went to the library with my friends (it's a small town in Ohio, there weren't that many places to hang out) I headed towards the back of the library where the computers were. When I sat down, I got a snapchat. It was him (Joel is his name, btw) saying he saw me. I looked up and he smiled and beckoned me over. From then on, the rest is history."

I was with him for about a week. Thats when I found out he had a long time girlfriend in Florida! They're actually still together now, she moved up here to Ohio and they have a child together. 

The LSD was basically what you'd expect. I had this preconceived notion of what I'd experience, so it kind of happened that way. I came home and vaguely remember calling my cat Simba and holding her above my head. I told my parents I was just drunk and high.

The funny thing is, I used to have a fairly popular FB page under the name Link Evans. I had 5000 friends and a couple of hundred followers. One day I posted my snapchat and he added me on there. We talked a little but never too much, until I saw him at the local library and he recognised me. The facade of fame and attractiveness gave me a big and stupid head."
