I sent them both letters. They both replied. The one I had a bad feeling about, I'm glad I left when I did. He basically called me a bitch while trying to egg on a conversation to talk to me?
The second replied, accepted the apology, but still does the same thing. So I keep him at arms length.
The point of the story: you may not receive a respond, or you may receive a scathing one. Just be ready for anything, but only accept a true apology and forget the rest. If it's not a true apology, then it's just their way of showing they are still feeling burned or resentful, and no one can fix that but themselves and maybe therapy.

My best friend since kindergarten chose a girl we all started hanging out with in highschool as her MOH and I was pretty effing hurt. It felt like all our time and memories together didnt mean as much to her as the few years she knew this other girl. 
Now that a few years have passed, I see she chose this other girl for external reasons that didnt have much to do with friendship, examples such as this other girls parents were wealthier than mine and she could provide more towards the wedding. And this other girl is a major planner for everything in life, I'm not. I kinda love on the edge and dont do planning well. 
When people get married, they tend to do what they feel is best for the situation, regardless of peoples feelings or how they might take it. She actually completely excluded one of our highschool friends for a girl she knew and who had good connections. I cant even imagine how the excluded girl felt. 
Please do not take her decision personally, I know it's so hard, but it honestly has nothing to do with you. I think external factors are in play right now and she thinks this other girl might be better suited for planning multiple events in a short time, throwing down hundreds of dollars on mundane things just to make the bride happy, etc. 
After it's all said and done, you'll probably be glad to have more of a laid back roll in the catastrophe that is a wedding...they can get a little tense as the day approaches. 
She might also be thinking of your emotional well being, since you say she knows about the BPD. She may know how intense and stressful it's going to be coordinating a bunch of people and events and doesn't want you to have negative feelings towards her when she still wants you to participate.

If you dont mind my asking, how old are you and your recent significant other? Sex being a focal point in relationships is pretty typical for a lot of people in their 20s, especially early 20s.

My bestie put it like this: finding the right therapist is like dating. Sometimes you know itll work out the first appointment. However, sometimes it takes a few sessions or even a few months to figure out they arent for you. Everyone is different, every therapist is different. Were all different and differently compatible. 
Find a therapist better compatible for your needs. Definitely dont need to make it personal when switching therapists. Your needs just arent being met by this one."
BPD,exjqs1s,t1_exibs76,1566357608.0,"Wasnt as ahead of time as I would have liked :/ I called and canceled before the place opened, but I was my therapists first appointment for the day. It seemed daunting, knowing the list of things I wanted to go over with her, and having it be before work. I usually go on my off day, but I didnt have one during the week this week. I'm definitely going to apologize to her, but your response did make me feel a bit better :)"
BPD,exjl6sh,t3_ct9ovj,1566353259.0,"I literally have to turn my phone off, put it in another room and blare a cooking show or something else that keeps my attention even for a few seconds.
Scream into a pillow, scream all the things I wish I could scream at them but wont because I know itll hurt them. 
Texting and social media brings out an insecure beast in me. 
PTSD from previous relationships creeps up, and I turn into a mess. 
I dont even realize I'm doing it, but I'm expecting them to treat me as shitty as previous partners have, so I go off. Being aware they arent youre past partners can help.
If they're too much like previous partners who did not work out, it may be time for a talk with yourself about what's best for your mental health.
Have you sat down in person and apologized to your bf? Dont use bpd as an excuse, but that you're having a rough mental health week. Take him out to do a favorite activity of his or cook/buy his favorite meal. 
Just bouncing thoughts around, I'm really not the best at advice but I hope something in there can help."
BPD,exjk4ov,t3_ct9wn1,1566352482.0,"I am to the men I'm not attracted to.
To the men I crave to have in my life, I am in no way good enough for them. 
Flip of a coin.
The attraction seals the deal."
BPD,exjjww7,t3_ct8g8i,1566352325.0,"This made me a bit weepy. Happiest of Birthdays to you :) your post is inspirational. 
I've been thinking a lot about suicide lately.
My 30th birthday is in a few weeks. For a couple months now, I've thought after my birthday would be a good time to wrap up this life. 
The harder I try to lead a normal life, the more it feels like I'm falling and failing. How do you stay positive, how do you keep a good outlook on things? I cry every day, multiple times a day, just wanting the pain to end. How did you start to feel better?"
BPD,exgvwww,t3_cso2px,1566277686.0,"I feel this. I want to love someone so badly. And I'm open to it, but I feel the right people dont step into my life. 
I'm SO cautious about meeting new men. I hardly like to give them a chance, and when I do I'm either head over heels or completely repelled. The problem is, the ones I go head over heels for never seem to stick. 
Its like they can smell theres something wrong in my head. Smell that I'm secretly an emotional mess that beats myself to keep myself from frantically texting or calling when they dont respond for hours or even a day. 
I just want to love somebody and have them love me back in the way I do. 
Too intensely and kinda messy and awkward, but so loyal and honest to a fault."
BPD,exgvdzb,t3_csp75r,1566276948.0,"It sounds like since its stable, you may think it's boring? Am I on the right track? 
Your previous was probably not stable, if obsession and insecurities grew. You're not feeling the ""flame"" (insecurities and constant worry that we mistake for infatuation and feelings by ripping apart every encounter).
D and J are different people. You can compare them, but only about as much as you can compare apples to oranges. They're both sweet fruit but they both provide so many different things from each other. 
I'm just bouncing some thoughts around for you, I dont really have an answer, but it sounds like you should stop putting them in the same box together because they're coworkers. I highly doubt you'll run into your former FP, your current person would let you know who's going to be at an event if you ask and are worried you two might attend at the same time.
Again, just thoughts here. I hope they help a little."
BPD,exdwzzu,t3_csbwgq,1566189468.0,"In all honesty, humans dont need to shower as much as what's considered socially acceptable, so consider it a favor to your natural skin barrier for not showering as much. You're immune system is probably thanking you for it too. 
All dry jokes aside, I wash cloth bathe a few times a week and shower once a week. I try to plan it like a chore I know I need to get done, so I have time set aside for it. I've found that listening to podcasts and youtube videos while showering helps with the feeling of being left alone with your own thoughts. I actually wash my hair in the sink just because I dont want to effing be in the shower longer than I need to be."
BPD,exdwofi,t3_csc0zy,1566189157.0,"I feel the same way. I started smoking way before I thought about therapy, diagnosing what I had, etc.
 Its been about 8 years of smoking more days than not, and when I stopped a few weeks ago while I was already having issues managing, it was almost unbearable. It's much easier when I'm feeling more stable to stop for a period, but I always pick the habit back up for my mind's sake for peace within a few days.
I do feel worrisome about it, but I try to equate it to a prescription, as some people do need prescriptions to mentally make it through the day and weed has way less side effects than a lot of prescriptions."
BPD,exdvk25,t3_csaid3,1566188099.0,"I had a relationship from age 21 to age 24 that eerily sounds so similar to yours. Let me tell you, dating fucking sucks but its WAY better than being in a relationship like that, with all that emotional and mental abuse. You do not need that, and you'll find someone who doesn't make you feel like that. I repeat, dating sucks but it's way better than wasting away thinking about or in a relationship with what you described. He sounds like he has mental instability of his own that needs addressed, and you are not his nurse or mother. Keep your head up, you can focus on yourself until the right person stumbles into your life. Then you'll know yourself better too."
BPD,exdusb7,t3_csb03w,1566187382.0,"I'm in a similar boat, my friend. And it sucks so bad.
 I'm finally getting to a phase of despising how heartless he was towards me in our last couple interactions. I say, focus on something like that and shift the focus and emotions. How they made you feel so small and worthless when they dont respond for a day and you know they've checked their phone, or how they brushed off getting too deep and created distance when the conversation got deep. How they simply dont treat you how youd like, and know that other people have the capability of doing. You deserve it. You deserve more than what you were getting."
BPD,exdu2lp,t3_csb4ey,1566186743.0,"When someone knows how to fix it, please let me know too. 
It's a sick kind of roller roaster. Sometimes I'm able to pinpoint a fleeting thought or small inconsiderate action of a stranger that set it off. Other times I'm left wondering if there's an alien fucking with my circuit board somewhere.
The only silver lining I'm able to gather over it, is that when the high is so high and the colors are so bright, I know that most others can't feel it or see it as intensely as me, or you :)"
BPD,exdr9yx,t1_exdayf1,1566184378.0,"Wow. I'm going through the, ""even if we date and then break up. It takes a long time for it to end, and it's usually set off by one tiny thing and I suddenly hate them and move on"" stage right now. I feel like I could have written this myself. This sub is so comforting in the way that i know we're not crazy and alone in these struggles."
BPD,exdl44x,t3_cml7m2,1566179571.0,"Yes. This. 
And when you find someone you love spending time with, it's a constant struggle to hide the pessimism when it seeps through their uplifting optimism when you're not quite comfortable telling them how much you're hurting inside yet. And then they leave, like they can smell there's something wrong and you're not worth the effort. And then there's such a deep hurt and abandonment that you feel you'll never meet anyone again. And then, as soon as you do meet someone new, you're already afraid of them leaving when they find out how fucked up your mind is. 
Constant hurting, a constant cycle. My last abandonment with paired with a miscarriage and he isnt interested in meeting up to talk about anything. The pain is so much. 
Definitely do not feel made for this world. I feel there aren't people made to handle me."
Miscarriage,exdbuzg,t3_cs5xkn,1566172479.0,"My heart is hurting for you, I'm so sorry for all of your losses. Do you have community plans that can be applied for through your hospital? My hospital has a community fund and people in the community fund it, for emergencies such as your d and c and miscarriage. Please ask your hospital. Call your courthouse, try to get some financial help and get this surgery done. I hope that you're able to find peace, we're always here to listen."
BPD,excxzd2,t3_cokxa8,1566162384.0,"This made me cry. 29f here and I just lost my favorite person. Hurting so badly, but this gave a small ray of hope. Thank you for being the kind of man we all hope comes into our lives."
BorderlinePDisorder,excxhd7,t3_cr6o77,1566162024.0,"Doesn't do a dang thing for me. I stick to THC. I really wish it would work, I dont like feeling ""addicted"" to thc."
BorderlinePDisorder,excx0xm,t3_crgoli,1566161702.0,"Wanting so badly to be accepted and understood by anyone and everyone. Hoping they'll relate, and ultimately scaring them away when they're not capable of relating. I do this. All. Of. The. Time. 
Finding a few people to alternate venting to can help a lot. Deactivating social media, trying to stay busy. It's all so hard. Things that come naturally to other people when it comes to distance and calmness takes so much more effort with things like BPD. Hang in there, the waves will calm."
Miscarriage,ex199vr,t3_cr0a0l,1565935423.0,"I was at 8-10 weeks along and had an emotional breakdown a couple weeks before and told him how I felt insecure and unvalued by him. He didn't fight to keep contact, said to feel better soon. 
I miscarried and lost a ton of blood, had to be transferred to a different hospital to stop the bleeding. 
I tried to reach out to him after 3 weeks of not talking, and hes not interested in talking to me to discuss this. I loved him and I lost something I didnt even know until it was gone. I lost someone I loved and someone I never had a chance to love all in the same week.
Starting outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and self identity therapy this next week because of how hard this has been. 
Be so very grateful he is sticking to your side. It means he cares about you so deeply, even if he cant completely understand your depth of grieving, he is staying with you and showing he cares in the best way he knows naturally. We all have different ways of showing love, and hes loving you, just not quite in the way that would bring the most comfort in this moment, but you'll cherish it when looking back, how he didnt leave your side."
Nexplanon,ewcfz1i,t3_cn8y1i,1565284153.0,"I've always fought with depression and anxiety and I feel that Nexplanon may be to blame for it getting worse recently, partially for the hormonal fluctuations and partially for the intense food cravings which make it harder to avoid foods that I KNOW affect my moods when I eat too much (wheat products and sugar). I'm debating getting it taken out since I'm not currently having sex and just wanted it as a 5 year reassurance against an accidental pregnancy. If I enter a long term relationship with a supportive and understanding partner, I may get it put back in but these mood swings and constant crying arent worth it alone.
Edit: I've had it just shy of two months and the intensity got worse with my negative emotions within a 2-3 week period."
