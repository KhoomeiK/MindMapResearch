Story time:


Many moons ago, when I was in 4th grade, my awesome teacher had us do an experiment. We had to direct her how to make a sandwich, but as if she had no knowledge of how to do so. The highlights included her ripping the bread bag open like a barbarian, putting 1/2 a jar of peanut butter on one slice, way too much jelly on top of that, ending in a sandwich that literally looked like it was made by someone who had no idea what a sandwich should be.  We had so much fun, and it taught us a lot about how to explain things more accurately and how to interpret directions.

Up the road from me, there was a fantastic Chinese place. Just your basic, strip mall, grab and go style setup with a daytime buffet. Small, run by a single family. 


Mom and dad were there all day, every day.  The friendliest, sweetest people. They had an adorable little boy, around eight, who was always doing his homework, playing, or chatting with customers. I goofed around with him a few times waiting for my food.  


One day the little guy was out playing, and being a kid he was goofing around with a toy and stopped to kneel in a parking spot, I think he dropped it.  He was in an empty spot, between two cars. A guy in a truck whipped into the spot and ran him over, killing him almost instantly.  


The driver apologized over and over, saying he didn‚Äôt see him.  It was deemed an accident. The family was understandably completely broken. They gave up on the business and moved back home.

I was a little chicken of the size/solidity of other cups.  My cousin recommended Softcups and they didn‚Äôt look as... scary?


Boiling a cup post cycle sounds like something I would forget.  It‚Äôs terrible to admit but it‚Äôs true.  


I like the convenience of keeping a spare on me and in my car.  I‚Äôve got the birth control implant so I‚Äôm pretty irregular.  


Startup cost.  Pretty much a moot point now considering what I‚Äôve spent on Softcups.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Not cotton. Little to no leaks.  


You know what‚Äôs uncomfortable for me?  Cramming a wad of cotton up here hoping it‚Äôs the right size for today and won‚Äôt bleed through in an hour, but also the right size to where I‚Äôm not pulling it out ‚Äúdry‚Äù.  Also cardboard applicators suck, and I feel shitty throwing 5+ plastic applicators away every day.  Sometimes I get clots that dislodge tampons enough to where it leaks. 


Or pads make me chafe and the adhesive makes my skin raw for days after. I could never find a pad that didn‚Äôt feel like a diaper to me. It feels like I get swamp crotch immediately. I get paranoid other people can smell my pad the second it has blood on it.  It‚Äôs ITCHY. Can people see it through my pants?  Did I line it up right for these particular undies?  Oh no, it peeled up a bit because I moved too much, now it‚Äôs sticking to weird places. Blech.

Also, do you think that the 23k people who tested positive were all slogging on healthy as a horse and didn‚Äôt know they were sick?

Once in a blue moon she thinks she sees a glimmer of familiar silver hair, or the devious glint of lilac eyes, but only for a moment.  Just another traveler in a riding cloak, passing through on their way to town.  Other times the heavy perfume of lilacs from the garden intertwines with the smell of blade oil and pulls her back to the past. 


{Sort of book spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.}


>! Ciri waits until everyone else has finished their nightly prayers and walks the halls like a ghost, her hair finally free from her veil and tumbling down around her shoulders. Certain she isn‚Äôt being followed, she enters an old storage room, leaving the door slightly ajar to let the moonlight in.  


A heavy trunk on the back wall of the room is adorned with locks, but otherwise plain. Unlocking it, she moves aside a long bundle wrapped in leather, but takes a moment to let her hand rest on it.  Another smaller box, the size of a good book, is removed and placed on her lap in the moonlight.  With a tiny flash of light, it opens to her touch. 


Inside, a wolfs head medallion lies next to an obsidian pendant, inlaid with a star.  The wolf‚Äôs head shivers in the moonlight, and a teardrop darkens the velvet lining of the box between the pair.  She received the wolf‚Äôs head first, with a letter that smelt of lilacs and gooseberries. The star pendant not long after, brought to her by a courier from the temple of Melitile.


Ciri gently closes the box and clutches it to her chest as more tears flow and quiet sobs shake her shoulders.  She had never known loneliness like this.  She knew when the monsters started stealing livestock and killing travelers, but she denied herself the truth.  Now the gardens struggled to grow and much needed rain never came.  


Of course they had stood by her, even in her self wrought exile. Of course.  The family she never had, that none of them ever had, and she had run away from it out of fear.  The loneliness was far more painful now, it tore at her chest and squeezed her heart.  !<


I know it‚Äôs a bit disjointed, but you probably get the vibe."

news,fivi07s,t1_fiuxkn2,1582760673.0,"Negligence.  Complete idiotic negligence.  It sucks that the poor little girl had to pay the ultimate price.


Cruise ships tend to have morgues to store people who die on board. It happens more than you think, they‚Äôve got procedures to handle it very discretely.  Not that being dangled and dropped over a railing by your freaking grandfather is going to allow for discretion."
medizzy,fiuxgch,t1_fiug5my,1582750026.0,"Exactly. I completely understand that it‚Äôs a slippery slope to decide who is ‚Äúsick enough‚Äù to die, but I‚Äôm still for it.  My aunt did hospice care for a couple of years and the stories she has are like what you mentioned. It makes me so sad and angry.  


Another aunt also had lung cancer and suffered for months in the final stages. She passed when she choked to death on blood, sputum, and **a** **piece** **of** **her** **lung** **tissue**.  Lung tissue.  Coughed it up and choked on it. She had already enacted a DNR, thankfully.  


Every illness you listed is absolutely as valid, and honestly they all scare the crap out of me.  Cancer is just close to home.  


Death comes for us all in the end, the terminally ill face the difficult question of when they will meet her. Whether you choose to wait and die naturally, or take steps to meet her at the crossroads through, you should have the right to do so on your own terms."
medizzy,fiuch18,t1_fiu5nbm,1582738849.0,"It breaks my heart still. We lost nana in 2017, she had a bad stroke and was on life support.  The doctors informed us she was at least 80% brain dead, and it was time to let her go. 


They removed her life support and she held on until one of my cousins told her she could ‚Äúgo be with pawpaw‚Äù, then she gave this big sigh and she was gone.  Three generations of us in there bawling our eyes out.  


I know some people don‚Äôt believe that the dying can hear what we say, but it is was uncanny.  They were married for 45 years before he passed, and she‚Äôd waited 21 more years to see him again in heaven.  I don‚Äôt practice any religion, I‚Äôm sort of agnostic, but I tell myself they‚Äôre together somewhere. 


Sorry for the walls of text.  I don‚Äôt really get to talk about them in real life."
medizzy,fiu25w0,t1_fitkjaf,1582733866.0,"My pawpaw had lung cancer.  He was in remission for a bit. One morning, while sitting with my nana at home he looked at her and said ‚ÄúThe cancer is back.‚Äù  She asked him how he knew and he said ‚ÄúI can feel it eating my bones.‚Äù  


He was right, they went back to the doctor and found out that it had metastasized into his bones.  They gave him six months or so to live, the timeframe is fuzzy now, this was in the 90‚Äôs.  


By the time he passed, he was in so much pain.  He would scream when they moved him to change his sheets. He would scream when the sheets touched him. He said he could feel his bones bending and begged them to make the pain stop.  This was a man who did physical labor his whole life and never complained about anything, tough as nails.


All they could do was pump him full of morphine and wait.  I was young so they didn‚Äôt let me see him once it was this bad, he didn‚Äôt want us to remember him as a sick old man in a hospital bed.  The suffering he went through was beyond cruel, and it‚Äôs why I believe in assisted suicide/medical euthanasia.  Death with dignity should be a right, especially for people with cancer.  


I don‚Äôt remember him as a sick old man, I remember him being silly with me and my cousins, snoozing on my moms couch, and giving my nana a hard time just to make us all laugh, her included.  


TLDR: FUCK cancer."
