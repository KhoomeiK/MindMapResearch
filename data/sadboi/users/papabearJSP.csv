I was paying $360 a month to stay living in my childhood bedroom that I shared with my brother. I worked 40 to 70 hours a week for about twenty years as a machinist because the wages are so low where I live. I only started making decent money after my kids grew up but then an accident forced me into retirement at 42 where I now live off of disability. Consider your life to be an open book right now.

I went through 18 months of rehab just to struggle at everything in life. Including holding my grandchild.
I am in constant pain. My life is fuckin miserable to put it in a positive frame here.
If you know anything about phantom limb sensation, you know there are degrees of this phenomenon. I am one of the lucky few in this world who gets to enjoy my seven surgeries that took place the week prior to & including the amputation itself. I have felt this nearly every day for five years in June. Unless you are in this boat with me, you DO NOT understand. Period.
I feel these thoughts and emotions like others do about loss, anger, frustration, blame, fear, etc. I want it all to end.
Right fucking now.
I get it too.
I however am a man with patience.
I know when I die, it will end forever. 
When that happens, I will never hold my children or their children again. I will never hold or smell my wife. Or eat frickin tacos, which I love. I won't even know or care or anything then, forever. So I am gonna love my family and eat my tacos while it's here. Even though it hurts. My time will come eventually. This might sound stupid but I am nearly 50 and that is old enough to make this decision in my mind. I hope this helps someone."
