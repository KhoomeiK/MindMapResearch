Last month, the New York Times reported on the then not-public video of the shooting, and that “In a separate document, Mr. Barnhill stated that video exists of Mr. Arbery ‘burglarizing a home immediately preceding the chase and confrontation,’” though **no reference to the earlier video is made in his letter**.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/08/ahmaud-arbery-video-arrest/)

The McMichael’s have no basis for a “citizen’s arrest”. Even if they did, Georgia law does not allow deadly force in a citizen’s arrest and only allows pursuit in the case of a felony. Trespassing and stealing a hammer isn’t a felony and it would be an uphill battle to prosecute a case as such. It is also apparent from the video evidence that the McMichael’s are ‘lying in wait’ for the victim, which makes it harder to make a legitimate claim to self-defense. The McMichael’s have no basis for pursuit or violent detainment of Mr. Arbery.

Congrats on the EMT license, but “I studied BJJ and went camping” is not a very strong list of accomplishments. It sounds like a generic Tinder profile. Especially when you include generic bullshit everyone deals with like “learned who I am” on that list. You’re like the male version of a basic bitch. 


Personally I have never done or made crack myself. Just learned how it’s made from a coworker and that has always stuck with me as one of the only things I actually learned in construction. Education doesn’t always have to be hands on. That’s the beauty of it. 


Literally none of the things you listed are exclusive to not getting a formal education or sound like particularly mind-blowing experiences for anyone that actually does things with their life. You’re just trying to justify not having an education."
