It's a very good idea to take this period to heal actually, I'll be doing the same, thank you."
BPD,fqwxbj0,t1_fqwwnjp,1589720400.0,"In order to make new friends you have to put yourself out there, maybe art school for adults, pottery or yoga, in a big city is easier to find an activity/hobby that interests you, and there you will meet new people.
Best of luck"
BPD,fqwubpg,t1_fqwtkwt,1589717852.0,"Mmm wrong isn't the most appropriate term, it depends on the person most of the time, some would love that kind of attention while some would feel ""suffocated"". It's ok if you don't understand it, for me relationships are so complicated because I feel I can never really do what I feel because of some kind of mysterious unwritten rule.
Small suggestion: If you have a lot of energy and affection to give (and that's wonderful) then surround yourself with good friends, so you can give 10% to someone and 20% to the other."
BPD,fqwsv1a,t1_fqwsl4z,1589716499.0,"They are not mutually exclusive though, especially in the beginning you want to spend every second with them and know everything about their life.
Honestly I'm still learning a lot but love is more of a choice than a feeling, when you love someone you chose them everyday, when you fight you make things work and even when you don't like them you still chose them."
BPD,fqwrqw7,t3_glbc6j,1589715420.0,"Hello, I assume you are quite young, you will meet a lot of wonderful and not-so-nice people out there during your life. 
I believe when we cross our path with someone, they are meant to teach us something in order to better ourselves, and if they leave that's ok, probably the universe is preparing someone better for you. 
Take care, I know it's hard but it gets better every timeüíú"

BPD,fqwqzpu,t3_gl7vuu,1589714655.0,"Hi :), here is my personal very simple though: love is being happy when someone else is happy, in obsession it doesn't matter, it's more self centered and you just care about your own happiness.
What's your thought?"

BPD,fp6amtb,t3_gbhulb,1588349051.0,"Totally relate. I'm the quiet type and my friends just believe in a play I put up everyday  to not scare them away. In their eyes I'm the most mature and optimistic person, behind closed doors I self harm and have continuous breakdown."

My only advice- that I'm also trying to follow- is: Don't abandon your friendships and don't make him the only reason of your happiness, love should only add to your happiness.
Good luck for everything ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
