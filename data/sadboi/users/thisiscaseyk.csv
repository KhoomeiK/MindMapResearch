KitchenConfidential,fkfplj1,t3_fi2kf1,1584139706.0,"Us. Same owner, three restaurants, one's also a brewery. A lot of sweeping changes the past two days. Our county is now in a state of emergency with all schools closed for 2 weeks. We are down 82% since this time last friday. Getting very nervous. Even though I'm salaried I'm barely better than paycheck-to-paycheck. Hopefully the government steps up for small businesses."

Also is there somewhere this break was announced or did I just miss it on air? This seems excessive to just ghost off the air for this long."

ankylosingspondylitis,fcwod06,t1_fcwnusy,1578031515.0,"Your feedback means a lot. Being pain free is something that‚Äôs just really never occurred to me as a possibility. I‚Äôve lived with this pain now for over a decade so it‚Äôs strange to think maybe there‚Äôs an end in sight.

I‚Äôm not afraid of needles really, it‚Äôs just more the thought that this is serious enough to warrant having to inject myself with medicine that‚Äôs solidifying the severity of the illness itself. I‚Äôll do fine with the injections physically. It‚Äôs mentally still a little jarring."

bipolar,f9h8mds,t3_e531hf,1575310931.0,"A song I wrote a few years ago, before I was diagnosed. I wrote it kind of as a suicide note of sorts, to be a song that I could point to and say ‚Äúthis is how I feel about everything‚Äù.

It helped me to start to admit to myself that maybe nothing can ‚Äúfix‚Äù me, that no lover or friend is responsible for making me whole. 

I‚Äôm hoping you guys can appreciate and maybe even get something out of it."

tifu,evchp7p,t3_cjbbme,1564415468.0,I had something similar happen last relationship. I was the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù for venting according to her. She claimed up and down she never said anything but great things about me to all her friends and family (obviously impossible). Needless to say it was the end of the relationship.
