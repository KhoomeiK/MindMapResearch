skiing,ffq7kbu,t3_et6b0t,1580124656.0,Differences between ski suits and snowmobile suits? I’m in the market for a used one-piece ski suit and I found a nice snowmobile suit on Facebook marketplace nearby for cheap. Would it be comfortable to ski in? I’ve tried googling the difference but I can’t find anything that really explains it.

birthcontrol,eupv2vz,t1_euk5mzy,1563964949.0,Dang that sounds like a long time to deal with that though! I'm glad it went away for you!
birthcontrol,eupuva2,t1_eul0rwg,1563964830.0,"Thank you so much for your response! I never knew birth control hormones could impact dopamine. I'm currently on latuda and lexapro as well which I'm pretty sure effects these things as well, although when I told my doctor she didn't have any concerns about it. Now that you mention it, it has only been when I get anxious that this becomes an issue. Generally I've been completely fine during the day but I start getting anxiety when it gets dark out which is usually manageable, and that's when the constant crying has been starting lately."
birthcontrol,eupu418,t1_eukrj2j,1563964407.0,Thanks!! That's what I'm hoping!
birthcontrol,euptzaz,t1_euimluq,1563964337.0,"Thanks for your reply!! I'm really hoping it's just the balcoltra. I also forgot to mention that this is my first month using it because my prescription for the pill I was previously on was out and the obgyn just gave me a sample month of that to use for the first month on nexplanon. So basically my hormones are just a mess right now lol. I've heard so many good things about nuvaring but when I tried it, it gave the same side effects that I'm dealing with now! Birth control really is different for everyone I guess"
birthcontrol,eupta65,t1_euk1pxh,1563963973.0,"Thanks! The weird thing is I tried nexplanon 3-4ish years ago and I don't remember it having any emotional side effects, the only reason it was taken out was because it made me get heavy bleeding for 6 months straight so my doctor took it out, but my new one is convinced that this won't happen if I start out on the pill too. Was your depression and anxiety okay otherwise when you were just on nexplanon?"
birthcontrol,euinj2q,t1_euiiu18,1563851469.0,Thanks! I really hope this isn't the case because I don't know how long I'll be able to deal with this. I was hoping that it might get better once I'm done doubling up with nexplanon and the pill. Did you find any other hormonal types of birth control that work for you?
birthcontrol,euimhhn,t1_euijugj,1563850898.0,Ugh I really hope mine goes the same way
birthcontrol,euimeeh,t1_euik9ov,1563850856.0,Has it gotten any less severe over time?
BipolarReddit,euecg8x,t1_euec6tm,1563740900.0,"On a more helpful note, like one of the other comments said, maybe you could find a city or cool place within a few hours drive from you and go there with someone? That was always helpful for me"
BipolarReddit,euec6tm,t3_cg2iq3,1563740712.0,"Soooo relatable. When I first started taking meds and my mania got less severe (better but doses still too low) I would always tell my husband that I was unbearably bored and the only thing that would help is to spend money or travel or drink. It was maddening. Sorry, I know this isn't super helpful but I can totally relate."
birthcontrol,eu6b15q,t1_eu5zbl5,1563496182.0,"Thank you!! When you did start bleeding after 3 months, how long did it last for?"
birthcontrol,eu5yozg,t3_ce0n9f,1563488388.0,I might be late to this but I just wanted to say that every drug store test I've ever taken (which was a lot since I'm really anxious and before I figured out I have a 35 day cycle it seemed like I was late every month) has had that faint line and I've never been pregnant. I always assumed if I was actually pregnant it would be a lot more defined
birthcontrol,eu5q0n4,t3_celx9x,1563482819.0,"Hi! I'm bipolar 1 and just had nexplanon inserted yesterday. I was on implanon 3 years ago and didn't notice any effects on my mood at all. The doctor didn't give me anything to stop the constant bleeding for 6 months and instead just took it out, which is why I'm trying it again with the pill for the first month. I can let you know how it goes for me in a few weeks if you want! No usual moods in the past 24 hours though lol"
birthcontrol,eu5odwp,t3_cexh7s,1563481826.0,"Also, if anyone could give me some advice on what to expect for the first few weeks on nexplanon that would be super helpful!"
birthcontrol,eu5nvf7,t3_cetwx6,1563481516.0,"I just had nexplanon inserted yesterday and my doctor told me to finish my pack of pills for this month to keep my cycle regular (last time I tried implanon it made me bleed for 6 months and the old doctor didn't give me anything to stop it, just took it out). My current doctor says it's safe, you should call yours though to make sure!"
