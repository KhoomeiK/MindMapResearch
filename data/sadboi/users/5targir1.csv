depression,fnd28cz,t3_g0vuu3,1586855851.0,"i know there’s probably not much i can say to actually help because i’m sure you’ve heard it all before, but i PROMISE. it gets better- i’m sure you’ve heard that one a million times but it really is the truth. For now all u can really do is hang tight. Since all this virus stuff is going on you probably feel extra stuck since home is obviously not your safe place. I literally almost ran away when i was 16, i had a whole plan and everything. i’m 18 now and i can’t even explain how distant that memory feels. All those problems are so far away that i don’t even remember what they were. I guess my point is that everything is going to change and your life is going to fall into place piece by piece before u even know it- within these two years my life has fallen apart and put itself back together a hundred times. life is crazy and weird and i know this sounds so stupid but seriously EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK I PROMISE.  i know family situations can be very complicated so if u do have a trusted family member that can help you out maybe give them a call and just talk to them about what’s been going on. Another thing u can do when u need to vent is calling suicide hotline, sometimes it really helps:) i’ve had good and bad experiences with them it really just depends who u get connected to, most of them will not only comfort you and listen to u but they will try their best to help u solve you’re problems. I hope your situation gets better soon just hang in there and try your best to stay positive. Another thing that helps me through depression is the law of attraction, but that might not be appealing to u if ur not into all that spiritual stuff. Good luck to you and feel free to message me anytime you need some help:-)"

I’m not the best at explaining so you probably will want to research a little bit but basically, you’re gonna need two cups and post it notes. The first cup will be labeled with your current state, so for you, you would want to write on the sticky note “financial discomfort” or something like that. Then you’ll fill it with water, and as you fill it make sure you’re really thinking about your current situation. Feel your emotions for a minute, and really think about it. You’re gonna label the other cup with your desired situation, so something like “financial comfort”. Then you’re gonna transfer the water into this cup, again being very mindful and thinking about your desires and really trying to channel that into the cup and the water. Again a YouTube search will probably get u a better explanation!!! Good luck;)"

Cats are awesome with territory/sense of direction and whatnot.... as far as a spell goes, I have never tried this one out but I noticed it in a book and saved the page, basically all you need is a lamp with a shade and an item that reminds you of your cat or something they love like maybe a toy. Ur gonna put the lamp in the window, and ur gonna wanna do it in a window that’s closest to a route your cat might be prone to taking or an area they often go to (not sure if they are an indoor or outdoor cat). Switch on the lamp and softly call your pets name, then nine times, say “stay not away, do not stray, lost and alone, beloved friend, I call and so you bear and follow my love back home.” Then go to the door holding the item you chose, call their name, and repeat the spell words six more times. Then go into your yard or into the street holding the item (again somewhere you’d maybe expect them to go), call them again, and repeat the spell words three more times. Once you get inside, hold the item and repeat the spell just once more. Then leave the lamp burning all night. Apparently this is best at dusk. Besides that your best bet is to manifest. Manifest manifest manifest. Get in the mindset that he is coming home. You need to keep on reminding yourself with affirmations. He’s on his way home, he is safe and he knows where to go, he is very close....things like that and you need to say them as if they’re certain. Also try to keep them positive, like try not to use negative words like “not”. Like I would definitely stray from saying “he is not in danger”, and instead say “he is safe”:) I seriously wish you the best of luck, I can’t even imagine what I’d do in that situation, it’s always been a huge fear of mine. I will be thinking about him all night and makr sure to update us when he is home safely:-) stay as positive as you can!!!"
