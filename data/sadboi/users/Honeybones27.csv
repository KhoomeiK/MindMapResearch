Cigarettes,fnkjfii,t1_fndhyb9,1587029346.0,My boyfriend gave me this roll box with tabacco and it’s even better than Bahman cigarettes.
Dissociation,flg4klm,t3_fogp52,1585130352.0,"Oh my gosh!!!!! In my nightmares i see exactly what u described!! It usually goes like this: i’m my self and everything in the house is the same, i feel like something’s chasing me or wanting to hurt me, an evil thing. Then in my dream i go to my parents and i explain what’s going on and they just don’t get it. They are so relaxed and they don’t care about my situation. One time i even dreamed i have an emergency and i go to my mom and she’s drunk (my mom doesn’t drink alcohol in real life). And i see no one can help me. I see this dream with my boyfriend in it too. That i’m sort of dying and trying to reach him but he is out of reach or just doesn’t care!! It’s the worst kind of nightmare. There’s another type of nightmare too that i see sometimes. It goes like this: i get in a physical fight with some being that is not human. Sometimes it’s a cat, sometimes it’s an insect.. and it hurts physically in the exact same place where it bit me when i wake up!

I really feel what you wrote here!! Sometimes i feel like everyone is against me. Or like my parents aren’t really there anymore. Like my real parents have disappeared and these two are just some other creations that are pretending to be them. But i don’t give in to these thoughts. I’m able to tell my self that i’m just having stupid thoughts.. 
You described all of it really good.. i hope we can get through these challenges..💪🏻"

This is triggering me because you don’t seem to get how many lives u put in danger. You could’ve just simply write about how good your experience was.. 
you can’t recommend drugs!"
microdosing,flcpjdc,t3_ds5eap,1585040829.0,Ok i’m happy that you think it has worked for you. But it’s very risky and effects everyone differently. YOU CAN’T SAY THAT YOU RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE ELSE. it’s still drugs you know?!!!??? That is not right to say if you’re wondering to do it or not go do it!! You are a very irresponsible old man who might have bad impacts on young adults.
Anxiety,flatwz2,t1_fkstvmy,1584991046.0,"Hey. The same thing exactly happened to me. I was ok with weed and i used to enjoy it very much. But now every time i smoke even if it’s just one puff i get so anxious. And when i’m sober and have to deal with my normal anxiety i think to my self, i have to get high to relax a bit, then i get high and everything gets worse. I see lots of people who have been smoking for years and they don’t get anxious at all. Weed is over for me"

sex,fiq94s8,t1_fiq83zu,1582638657.0,"Some folks will feel like they need to pee before they squirt. If you feel that way, it's a sign squirting may be on your horizon. Stop when you're done, not because you think you have to pee.Nov 20, 2019
I found this on google"
sex,fiq7i19,t1_fiq790i,1582637369.0,"I don’t think so. infections will make you feel like you wanna pee constantly too but they don’t happen exactly after fingering, it usually takes time for the infection to start. Plus i was really close to squirt and the engine kinda stayed on i guess lol"
