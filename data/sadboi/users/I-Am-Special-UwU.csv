AmItheAsshole,fpfu39z,t1_fpfj3rw,1588583541.0,"I kinda get this. When I moved out of my home there were 7 of us. My dad earned <£25,000 per year, though I think we did get child tax credits and crap. But my parents are also in debt. And this was before they split (i.e. last September). 

They did well at making it seem like we weren't struggling but all of us knew we're deemed poor. So seeing someone say they're not rich when they make around 20+x what my family does is really uncomfortable."

BPD,fp8zyng,t3_gc2x11,1588409049.0,"I've been struggling with the same. I've been realising that identity is complex and nuanced, and you can be so many things at once and it's all okay.

What I did was write down a list of things I wouldn't be against trying using the [list of hobbies from Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies) as a guide. I've then been asking my FP to try to push me to do them because I do get too nervous to do them. Then I evaluate if I enjoy them and if I do that becomes a part of who I am. I'm learning I have a strong pull to nerd/geek culture but also have a strong interest in art, fashion and makeup.

I've found it's just something to take one step at a time, day by day. I need to learn to say ""no"" more assertively because letting people force things on me was part of what led to my identity confusion in the first place. And if necessary, write it down to remind yourself what you're learning when you feel bad and are slipping back to your lack of identity."

AskWomen,fnpkrlo,t3_g308cb,1587147230.0,"After a lot of discussion, my partner and I chose abortion.

We had been using contraception, but as you can tell, it failed and I just so happened to be ovulating. We (both 18) actually wanted the baby and were willing to skip university to have the child and work instead. I already know how to raise kids, having acted as a third parent to my younger siblings from age 12. The reasons we aborted in the end included things such as:

* We have mental health issues. I, for example, have BPD, and my anger often leads to me punching myself anywhere it will hurt, including the face, gut and kneecaps. I would also try to turn to alcohol for comfort at the time. I'd probably kill or permanently damage the baby during the pregnancy, or harm their mental health when they were born.

* Linked to this, I suffer from the effects of emotional, physical and some financial abuse. My dad had been abused as a kid and it seeped into his parenting too much, and my mum was just as bad though she hadn't been abused. We wanted me to recover from this before having a family, in case the abuse I suffered seeped into my parenting and the cycle started again.

* Supposedly, the minimum amount of money a 3-person family can live comfortably with in the U.K. is £25,000 per year. We both had jobs and didn't even have £10,000 between us. With our lack of experience and my severe morning sickness it was doubtful we'd have enough by the time the baby was born to sufficiently care for the baby. We couldn't rely on our parents.

* We don't believe in putting children up for adoption. There are so many already and I personally could never trust another person with my baby.

In the end we figured it was more logical to abort based on these factors. After discussing it with family, close friends, and the doctors who asked, they all agreed that it was the best route, so we went for it. And we regret it."
AskWomen,fnpi8et,t3_g34y3g,1587145959.0,"Unfortunately, I don't. 

I'm 18 and my issues up to this point have mostly been passed off as brattiness, hormones and tiredness, except I found out I actually have BPD. I never learned a coping mechanism because I was never given the tools to when I already innately lacked such things. I know that sometimes listening to music and eating can calm me down, as can financing and basically any logical structure, but this is only if I catch it early on enough, which is difficult given I can't identify my emotions well half of the time and they are unpredictable. When I actually have an outburst I have to be very, very carefully guided through it or ride it out until I am too exhausted to do any more."
AskWomen,fnphlkj,t3_g36oxv,1587145643.0,"I have BPD and tend to blow up under stress, so most of the time I just have to ride it out until I've exhausted myself. But when I can catch it, music, financing and food calm me down."
AmItheAsshole,fnksb5w,t3_g27f2p,1587038503.0,"Edit: Changed to soft ESH; it's your choice as to what you want to eat and unless you guys had previously discussed and agreed to limit calorie intake for weight loss purposes or something, then there is no reason for her to be so strict. You're just eating what you feel you need to not go hungry, and I think your effort to form a compromise in cutting the meal you did make was good.

But, potentially controversially, I somewhat get where your wife may be coming from (emphasis on MAY, I'm not the wife so I'm not certain). My partner is 5'10, 64kg, and is a bit meaty himself (though is by no means fat or overweight).

However, he eats like a pig and does little exercise. 2-3 servings of food for tea, plus breakfast and lunch, plus snacks. He will rarely eat any of his five-a-day, so his meals generally consist of meat (which he loves to dip into the fats that run out), pasta and potato products, which isn't completely unhealthy but I don't think is great either. And because he's always so hungry, he slurps, chews with his mouth open, and is just generally kind of disgusting while eating, which can make me uncomfortable when I'm PMSing and my sensitivity to disgust goes through the roof.

Also, his eating habits are expensive (though this may just be my perception due to coming from a poor family) - like on top of the £140 we collectively pay his parents, part of which is to cover food, he pays an extra £30 just for himself. In my eyes, £40+ on food per week for one person is a lot.

It's certainly no excuse to force these things onto you - you guys need to be able to talk about these things properly and determine what the real issue is, but if your situation is similar I can see why it may be bothersome. Even if you do a lot of exercise, the expensive eating habits one may still apply. We don't know your weight, height, body fat percentage, how big your meals are, and so on, so we can't accurately gauge it and it vaguely feels like this information is conveniently being left out."

He is, I'm very lucky to have him. I think it's been in part because in the time we've been dating I've just happened to have one severe life problem after another, and being under stress makes it much more frequent.

It's not much, but we've managed to at least get me at a point where I am catching and addressing thoughts/feelings much sooner, so actual destructive outbursts are more around a weekly basis as opposed to daily unless I am legitimately in a bad state (e.g. parental divorce). It's now just adding work on the severity of these, I guess."
