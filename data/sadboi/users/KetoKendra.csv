ketogains,fp8ot9a,t1_fp8djp8,1588398252.0,You may have altered your metabolism. When dieting and reducing calories we can lose weight and if you stay low cal for to long or go back n forth a lot your metabolism will drop. It may take a few weeks to stabilize and bring back up. Which is hard because at first you may even gain a little. However if you stick with a clean Whole Foods type keto you‚Äôll gain less. Even adding a few more carbs on workout days may help. I ended up adding sweet potatoes or a small apple with peanut butter 20 min prior to a workout. I‚Äôd even say you could need closer to 1800 calories with your activity level and height.
bipolar2,fp8m1dh,t1_fosvm4l,1588395937.0,Funny you say that I was just talking with a friend today about us both going and get tested! It is seriously crazy how different I feel after 3 days with out starches gluten and sugars. It‚Äôs like night and day- two separate people practically! And I have gone back n forth between eating starches gluten and sugars and eating w/o them again. I‚Äôm positive it‚Äôs not just a coincidence it‚Äôs like clockwork each time. Your comment might have just become enough reason for me to look into this and get tested. Thanks üòä

bipolar2,fp8dcy0,t1_fp6tvn2,1588389480.0,You‚Äôre not alone- my ex actually stepped over me as I laid on the floor crying after I told him about my thoughts/feelings.
bipolar2,fos1mf8,t3_g923gc,1588022330.0,"Yes!!! I can hardly ever fall asleep before 2-3am and have to be up at 7am after a few days in a row I‚Äôm exhausted and turn into a couch potato during my waking hours. Then everyone around sees me as lazy. I seriously try to fall asleep around 9-10pm I take melatonin, Benadryl, Costco sleep aid, muscle relaxer- you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be passed out but nope- not till 2 or 3am! When I avoid gluten sugar and starch in my diet I get more energy during the day even with my bad sleep patterns. However it‚Äôs hard to stay consistent with lack of ability getting fresh foods at the store to cook every few days- I‚Äôm shopping once every 3 weeks at Costco having to eat lots of starch and gluten lately."
BipolarReddit,fmuej4v,t1_fmu5g1x,1586389843.0,Awesome! Thank you üôè
BipolarReddit,fmu28tz,t1_fms3451,1586383216.0,Congratulations both of you! I recently have gone back to community college. Taking all online classes last fall and this spring. I felt online classes are the only way I can succeed. Still I struggle with depression and migraines and the occasional hypomanic episode- which has caused me to miss assignments or do poorly on timed tests. Thankfully I am able to get great grades on assignments I actually do. This keeps me at about a B average. Or 3.0 gpa. I have wondered if I‚Äôm eligible for support service plan and what that would include. I‚Äôve been diagnosed for nearly 20years now and have always rejected the idea of getting assistance or help probably due to the fact that my family doesn‚Äôt understand or believe in bipolar. So I‚Äôve never had anything but tough luck struggles most of my life- I‚Äôve been worried about transferring to University next spring feeling like I won‚Äôt be able to manage if I have to go to classes in person. What type of services/help/allowances can be made for someone diagnosed bipolar?
ketorecipes,fm1ohyf,t1_fm0c501,1585682152.0,It‚Äôs the high glycemic index of maltodextrin that you want to avoid- it might not raise blood sugar levels much but it can still spike insulin worse than table sugar- http://www.sugar-and-sweetener-guide.com/glycemic-index-for-sweeteners.html
bipolar2,fhgn3dy,t3_f32bpc,1581571912.0,Omg this is the best depiction of my life ever! Thank you!!!
Cosmetology,fhgma0i,t1_fhggbho,1581571188.0,The Matrix total results brass off mask works amazing. It‚Äôs really thick and heavily pigmented. I‚Äôd try in shower leaving on 5 min- if you wanted more toning after that you can leave it on longer prob up to 20 min. You can do test strands to figure out perfect amount of time for your hair color. This is less damaging than coloring your hair over and over.

Ketomealseatingnow,f7lwmrq,t3_dwk4j8,1573849446.0,You can even try to season the cucumbers with taco type seasonings  or get seasoned cream cheese....
xxketo,f6y77m5,t1_f6xd819,1573269802.0,"I use the pee strips ALL the time! They work awesome for me! They help me realize when I‚Äôm slacking even if I don‚Äôt consciously realize it- I‚Äôve never had a false positive.... if I test negative but think I had been doing good I just go to a meat/avocado/egg diet for a day or two and I‚Äôll be testing in mid positive range again. I know people who say they don‚Äôt work but when I personally see what they eat I think to my self- the test is working you just don‚Äôt like the negative result, so you say they are useless..... I‚Äôve been doing keto nearly 3 years now.... and using the test strips.....

And too much protein has the potential to keep you out of ketosis- along with some artificial zero carb zero calorie sweeteners. Check glycemic index on any zero calorie sweeteners you‚Äôre unsure of- if they have high glycemic index they won‚Äôt spike blood sugar but will trigger insulin which slows ketosis."
xxketo,ey7er4i,t1_ey6v4xd,1566880507.0,Try breaking your Lilly‚Äôs bar up or get the Lilly‚Äôs chips then stir them into your home made whipped cream then place in freezer for 15-30min.... not too long though it gets super frozen lol - best to make just enough for 1 serving. Or just get the new Rebel ice cream- those have to set out for 20+ min to thaw for best flavor! Oh fresh diced strawberry‚Äôs in home made whipped cream  is amazing as well! I‚Äôve even done just a few frozen pitted cherries chopped into small bits + Lilly‚Äôs chocolate baking chips in my whipped cream for a home made keto friendly Cherry Garcia B&J‚Äôs üòã
Keto_Food,eubv5gm,t3_cfphjm,1563657814.0,You would think they could have some sort of safety seal on them. I was quite puzzled the first time I got some home.
Keto_Food,eubv1mw,t3_cfphjm,1563657736.0,Hahaha I am on here killing time. Waiting on my timer... 15 min... for my Chocolate Rebel. Can‚Äôt wait till more flavors hit stores near me.
xxketo,eqrwvyb,t3_bzei9k,1560271733.0,Thank you for the inspiration! You‚Äôve done amazing work!!!
