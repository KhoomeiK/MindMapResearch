For one, i felt like I was on the older end of that crowd. First time that’s ever happened cuz I still feel like I’m pretty young. 

& also, the crowd was just... really young & really mean. Instead of laughing & smiling while dancing & or headbanging / (however you get down) it was like the entire crowd had X’s on hands, standing still, looking super angry and sizing up everyone around them. Forget about trying to politely maneuver around someone, even with an excuse me thought I was gonna get shanked. these kids were just tweaking tf out. Instead of the venue permeating with positive vibes, felt more like someone was about to start firing off shots in the club.  

I get it’s some high energy, angry robot noises, but we don’t need to be angry while there ya know?? 

Must say that a month later went to Boogie T & ganja white night and the crowd was a million times friendlier / more positive. The show I was talking about this post was Mastadon.

Like a massive field with a significantly reduced crowd, people spread out, people buying expensive tickets for their own little piece of socially distanced land. The drive in thing seems just stupid, but I bet live nation & AEG etc are just trying to think of whatever they can to mitigate the masses until full scale is back. 

Streams have been dope, jam bands & electronic music have done a hell of a job with this, but we all can admit nothing hits like being in person at a show / fest. Nor could streams ever replace being at a show in person. But they’ll have to do for god only knows how long. 

The thing is there is just too much money involved in live music events (read somewhere it’s like 12 billion dollars) for it to be stopped / never return. Through hell & high water it will be back, and eventually full scale. 

I read an article some dude in the music industry was like “I think the average person won’t wanna come out, or be hesitant to come once things return, some people may never want to be in a crowd again, or be off put.” 

Maybe the “average” person, but I think I speak for a lot of people that’s just not true. Live music is too important for me to be off put in the future, despite me avoiding the shit out of people in the grocery store currently.

Im still such a noob, but I’d say what’s helped me the most for getting higher & faster Ollies is finding a sweet spot between foot placement and speed, so to speak. 

At first, keep your front foot closer to the front of the board (like right behind the screws for the trucks) for more control. And seriously, when I first started it was like crawling speed. Just the slightest little push, then with minimal speed try to do an ollie. I remember it feeling so terrifying, but now feels very natural. Keep repeating but everyday trying to be moving just a little bit faster.  And at first don’t even trip about how high you are, or aren’t getting off the ground. Just a lil bit of space while moving is enough at first to build off of. 

And as you feel more comfy, you can start to bring your front foot back more towards your popping foot to get higher off the ground. 

Also I just went back to find what my buddy that’s been skating for awhile texted me when I was talking to him about exactly this : 

“helped me a ton is when you’re bending your knees before you pop try to focus on keeping your center of balance over the board”
