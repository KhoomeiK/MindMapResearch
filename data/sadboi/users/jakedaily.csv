TrueChristian,fqvx5n3,t3_gl830y,1589687216.0,I was always raised in a Christian home but what sealed it for me was about 7 years ago my brother called me and asked me to come help get his flat tire off the time was also after midnight. He was at a gas station kind of in the country side. I went out and we tried and tried and couldn’t get the tire off. My brother said a prayer and asked God for help. Not even 5 minutes later a tow truck pulled in and came straight to us and asked if we needed help. We said yes and he grab his hammer and one smack knocked the tire off. Ever since then I’ve believed in God.
