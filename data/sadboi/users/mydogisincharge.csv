They’ve been getting a lot of complicated information about what they are and are not allowed to do right now, and making tough choices between prioritizing human community health, and providing animal care services which I promise are very important to them. Guidelines in many areas are fuzzy at best. 

I’ve seen a lot of hate on both sides of the debate on whether vets should be performing spay and neuter right now. 95% of the veterinarians I know are wonderful, animal-loving humans who are doing their best to navigate this confusion landscape, just like the rest of us.

Thank you to this wonderful human for taking care of this wonderful pup!"

Then, add the sugar, and try again. 

If you liked it with just the cream, next try a latte or cappuccino. If you liked it with the cream and sugar, try a sweetened drink like a mocha or blended frozen drink. And if you liked it black, congratulations you’re a natural!"
