Every cell in your body is made from what we eat, essentially.  So if you’re giving your body shitty food,  it’s having to use those poor building blocks to create itself.  Our cells die and we make new ones all the time(for most our cells).  Now imagine you start eating healthy.  It’s like giving your body better tools to make its cells.  Thus,  your body’s foundation is healthier and you experience this as a whole.
