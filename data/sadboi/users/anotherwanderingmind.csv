depression,eu6kgcl,t1_etsq9lv,1563502351.0,For me it's like I get to work and within ten minutes I might as well be standing in front of a loud speaker that is constantly spewing out self doubting phrases at me.
depression,eu6k216,t3_cd0hjp,1563502087.0,"This is sort of backwards, but I am so happy to see that I am not the only one that gets this feeling. It makes every day life feel like a prison."

Rateme,esl1n5i,t3_c842n4,1562077560.0,"As someone who has always looked way to young and sits at 5'9, I'm jealous that you look well over 30 and are only 21."
relationships,esl0640,t1_esk0u33,1562076831.0,"I wouldn't say head over heels, but I get what you're saying. I have a pretty vivid memory in most things, I have an anxious nature that makes me ruminate over most things.

If I lived in a cheaper area and south Florida wasn't full of crazy people, I easily would. But finding a minute roommate for both me and her is going to be tough.

Thing is though, I really enjoy being her friend, I do. She's a great roommate. I just want to get past this"
relationships,eskzwcq,t1_esk10vm,1562076689.0,"I would like to. I was seeing a therapist last year but she ended up leaving the practice, and I spent a lot of time there and don't to go through that again just to end up back at ground zero.

And I'm trying to get out and meet other women, but not having any success. I'm having a really hard time being happy when I'm out and end up not really talking to many people."

Rateme,esce2a9,t3_c71obq,1561827366.0,"Since link posts don't have descriptions, I wanted to add a bit about me: I'm a bit of an insomniac, and have been doing a lot of deep thinking in the late hours of the night. Among them, is the need to know how I truly appear to others out there. I'm usually one to hide my insecurities and always put on a tough wall, but it's become unhealthy and I need to change.

Forgive my tired pictures, they're not the best but I don't have any other recent ones. I'm not quite sure what to write here, but I want to really get some introspective on myself from others standpoint.

If you wish, a couple of things that would be appreciated:

&#x200B;

\- An honest rating 1-10

\- I look young, but is that a problem and does it change your perception of me?

\- I've suffered from fairly severe acne forever, but it has finally slowed down. How much does the scarring affect my appearance?

\- I've become self conscious of the gap in my front teeth, and their general appearance. How much do you notice them?

&#x200B;

Thanks... I appreciate anyone taking their time here to give me some feedback."
