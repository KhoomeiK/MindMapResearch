his brain is still is developing, like i belive you shit gobblers must be aswell, for i know no reason for a fully developed brain to put down shit on another that is still in its earliest stages of development.

m8, im sorry, really am, how you described it, hit really close to home ya know.
i wish i had advice for you or but these are entirely personal victories. what works for one does not necessarily work for another.

if you put a gun to my head and demanded one. i would probably say,, cope, as bad as that sounds, it is generally our only option available. one step forward. one breath at a time, ill stop myself here before i begin sounding like i crawled out of a fortune cookie. 

it will get better, if you put in the effort to feel better. it will be hard, it will not be impossible.
it wont happen overnight, and you probably wont notice you have gotten better, till you have already been better for awhile. 
im sorry your having to experiance this, it is unfair, tis was the main thought going through my mind all the time. i wouldnt  be surprised it comes to the forefront of yours now and again.

His head sank to his chest that was still and  not beating, till,, badum badum badum,  it started again.

he slowely lifted his head and gave his captives a small grin, you guys really can't take a joke, Tesla said and spit a bloody loogey from his mouth after having bitten down on the inside of his chin from that last shock.

Fellas, he said. cant we be reasonable here its been quite some time since,,,

Tell me where the bolts are, or dont, it really doesn't matter to me.

fuck Baccus is that any way to greet an old friend?

Old friend? Baccus replies, you have had me on a merry chase for the better part of a millenia.

""well its good to get off that stuffy mountain isnt it?""

""you stole Zeus's lightning bolts""

""well more like borrowed, indefinetly""

(insert soul tearing wail here)

""you ended the reign of the Olympians and we will have it back, now where are the bolts""

""Baccus you old goat for brains, they are literally at your fingertips, where do you think that juicy A.C comes from?""

Baccus looked down at his instruments in dumbfounded bewilderment as it slowely dawned on him what Tesla just said.
""you gave the bolts to the humans?"" he asked incredulously you did it again?

It never dawned on you Baccus that the world is hummin along on some real neat god juice Bakkus my boy and to tell you the truth Bakkus, i got the idea from you.

what!?!?!? replied Baccus now in a state of utter disrepair, the bolts where gone and Zeus would not be happy about that. 

you forgot? asked Tesla.

what, said Baccus.

Baccus buddy you alright?

(insert nightmares howls here)

Baccus would you please, please stop with the bloody electrecutions, been working on those bolts for a better part of a decade now and electrecuted myself worse than this thousunds of times, once i even lost a week because my instruments exploded and i with them. it was an awful mess.
took forever to pull myself together after that.

 but whyyy???, cried Baccus, why did you steal them? why have you done this? and why the hell are you calling yourself Tesla? 

because going by Prometheus would kinda be a dead give away wouldnt it, as too why, because Zeus is a giant douche. he chained me up and had an eagle make a succulent dinner out of my liver EVERY night.
do you know how much it hurts regrowing a whole fucking organ overnight every nights for what seemed like an eternity.
and for what? giving my MY FUCKING FIRE TO THE HUMANS.

but why do you say that i gave you thr idea for zeus.'s bolts? Baccus asked in confusion.

ohh yeah that. remember that night when you threw that terrific baccanalian dungeon themed party you threw down in my dungeon. 
you trying to hit of with Athena but Zeus threw that dazzling light show and Athena forgot you even existed?

oh no, Baccus cried as comprehension dawned on him.

oh yes Prometheus replied.

now somwhere in that movie they claim that if they explode their rockets in the air their dispersal method might  be vastly improved vs letting it impact on the ground.
the substances  covid and their VX chemichal are hardly comparable, the VX in this case being much heavier and substanstial, would not evaporate in the air and would blanket the spot of a targeted are.

these big life changes can wreak havoc on ghe mind and ramp up your anxiety and stress levels. 
your body and mind funnily enaugh do not work in that good of a sync. 
your elevated stress levels makes for light sleep because it feels threathened or not as safe and comfortable as usual. hence your lack of sleep.

try and stay active, go for walks. work out. occupy your mind and body and do not enter tour bedroom till your ready to sleep, and when you do leave your phone ""preferably turned off"" in another room. that goes for all electronics in your bedroom.

AskReddit,fj5q7cz,t3_fbiay6,1583039534.0,"the world has ended several times by several means, we dont notice this because the multiverse is interconnected in an immeterial way and when you or we get offed by one way or another we ""almost"" seamlessly awaken to our most identical alterior multiverse, so as to lessen the the transition.
many have theorized that the mandela effect is an indication of thus.

here is where ill loose many.

we are living entities, living and loving in a computer created simulation in an nigh on infinite repeate with miniscule variations in environment.
the  accumulated experiances of our lifetimes are stored in out as information in our brains but locked by our dna/rna as to avoid an ""episode"" 

if a said individual does have an episode it is more often then not labelez as a schizophrenic episode or the curruption of our file might produce ""alzheimers""
the program see's little threat to itself eventhough a few minds have corrupted on this playthrough as they will most likely reset them self on the next one.
making is have to live a slightely version of our former without remembering the old."

sticker begins to circulate inciting righteous outrage.
but they claim they didnt make it, we cant really prove or disprove that. 
the matter it went into circulation at all.
commence outrage war, but no one can really point fingers at anyone. might have been Gretas supporters that started the distribution just yo get a cry of outrage. 
people are messed up and people love to be right especially if they can grab a moral highground. 
but ofcourse the people should be outraged, but at whom? the company were a handful of unstable people with questionable morals are working, or the  one who got that sticker into circulation.
now if you hang the wrong one, that makes more cries of outrage and so on an so forth."

Im not sure this is relatable as a trigger, but it can really grind my gears having to place trust into other. 
and then i mean neccisarily having to trust others with out option to do otherwise. 
was screwed over often and pretty badly in the past which kinda put me in a sour dispositions towards others.
ill be on pins and needles and anxious and stressed as anything until said ordeal is over, and unreasonably soo. not that i dont want too trust, just that i feel unable too, take from that as you will.
i wish you two luck on your musical and other endeavours."

depression,fah5h3o,t3_e8x8po,1576079590.0,"we were the poets and writers of old.
we were the playwright that put on a show.
we were the healers of not body but soul,
for we knew how frail our egos can grow.

we were the crutch for our neighbours
that they knew not they needed.
but now it seems with so much connection
we got cut off and left in our own dereliction.

with so much violance, strife and famine around,
anxiety, anger and sadness getting tossed about.
we grew quiet and hid from the rest of the world.
there is only so much one empath can do.

so our room became our shelter,
to wage our internal struggle.
where our mind is our adversary and our conscience our foe.
so best to keep it occupied in our war of attrition,
that we wage on ourselves of our own volition."
AskReddit,fagnohr,t3_e93q4i,1576064631.0,"annoyance, used to get this on and off a through my teen years, usually i was dreaming some unusual dreams more than not night terrors wich one promptly wakes up from. but imagine waking up from a night terror but you cant really move or scream. somtimes i could half open my eyes, but my hearing was fine though.
now there are two options from there. 
lie and will yourself awake. or go back to sleep to try and wake up normally.
both options are double edged.

option 1 was dreadfully scary at first, terrifying really cause your not really sure whats going on, are you still asleep? still dreaming? am i stuck like this? is somthing happening? is there somone there ? hello? 
its really quite unnerving.
after a dozen years or so though its just annoying. you can will yourself out of it with some effort. somtimes the effort explodes out when it finally happens, once i bolted out of bed when i was trying to rotate myself awake cause i was lying on my face. i flew out of the bed, my dog nearly had a heart attack that night.. other times its maybe just an explosive situp or arm jerk or leg jerk.

now option two was abit scary aswell and i didnt really opt for it till i kinda got the hang of willing myself awake. since night terrors usually sent me in that state, going back to sleep usually meant going right back into the same dreams. 
but thank god for silver lingings yeh. 
sleep paralysis is pretty akin to lucid dreaming, or well it can be, if you wake up in a ""S-P"" state and you manage to not freak out and calmly and knowingly let yourself drift off again you may enter a lucid dream state. that helped me get rid of my night terrors. 

for what i saw during my episodes, nothing really, more like since i only had my hearing and an annoying case of tinnitus it just felt like somone crancked the tv up to max lvl at the end of an emergency announcement. that kind of high pitched whining warbling up n down."

im pretty sure your partner feels the same so she tries to show you how much she cares for you, thats not in my arsenal.
but i have, or a am in a similar place. thinking i will off myself one of these days.
so out of my arsenal to you, maybe it helps. maybe not.
i keep clinging on to a tought. that your life is not yours to do with as you please. 
you are integrated into your partners, your families, your friends lives. and if you hurt yourself your doing them a raw deal. one that they are ill equiped too deal with.. so please stay strong, i hope you find peace within yourself."

Not that i can say anything since i mostly feel the way you do, its to much hassle to deal with so ill let it drag me to an early grave..
thats what these issues do ya know, stress you out and weigh you down. keep em close to heart and live with em alll the more strenght to you, but if you can cut away unnecessary burdens by simply talking about them.. who knows might be worth it. whatever you do.. strenght to you , may you find peace within you"
