He was tasked with giving truck drivers signals to help them reverse, this was before reversing cameras were common place. The first rule of his job was never position yourself directly behind the truck.  The truck should have stopped when the driver couldn’t see the banksman, but he assumed that the banksman had moved out of the working area. He hadn’t.  The banksman had fallen over a small item of scrap and hurt his leg. Operatives outside the working area tried to signal the driver to stop, but it was too late.  He reversed and the outside wheel of the double axle crushed the banksmans head. The truck wasn’t stopped until the double axle reached the banksmans waist, mangling the body beyond recognition. The driver had to tell his story to the coroner’s court and the prosecution trial. He was given counselling by the company, but was a shattered man. 18 months after the accident, he unfortunately suicided.  The banksman was married with 2 small children, as was the driver."

They keep telling me that I have only 6 months to live, but that has been going on for nearly 4 years. Not cockey, but I enjoy life, although getting about, without my wheelchair, seems beyond me.  I guess at 10, you are around 15 years older than me (in cat years) although it has to be said, you look in better shape than me.  Since I became ill, I have found that there are numerous secrets to life.  First of all, I have found waking up every morning, is a real bonus. Second, keep breathing. Third, eat and drink what you want (in moderation). Fourth, don’t lie down in the roadway, no matter how cute, you think you look.  Fifth, don’t be getting in any scraps, it ain’t worth it. 6th enjoy the company of your friends, human, feline and even canine. 7th only go outside when it is mild.  I prefer sunny, but I still like getting caught in a summer shower. 8th, don’t let the sun go down on an argument, make it right before sleep. Especially if you are sleeping in the same bed. 9th,  Always, always, always, tell your family and friends that you love them. 10th don’t complain about feeling ill, otherwise you will end up in the vets office and someone will want to stick something up your arse. 

Remember the number one rule is DON’T DIE!!!  Stay away from the light (it could be car headlights). Never go near Aunt Dorothy, when she is wearing high heels.

lastimages,flzkcb4,t3_frvaqt,1585625777.0,"Man, as a father, grandfather and a relatively recent widower, my heart bleeds for you and your family. This past year must have been so difficult for you guys. So many triggers for memories, anniversaries, birthdays and Christmas. 

My late wife said to me, that after she died my life would go on, but it would never be as good.  That must be doubly so, when you lose a child, especially one as young as Christopher. 

I strongly believe, that we are NOT designed to lose a child. Our mental infrastructure, is designed to take the loss of a parent, and that can be bad enough. However, losing a child is a brutal assault on you, both mentally and physically. 

My Son is 28 this year and I still worry about him and his family everyday.  I feel I have a good understanding of your loss, but when I think about it I guess I don’t really understand the enormity of it. 

My hope for you is that you and your family might reach a peace of accepting Christopher’s death.  People say that “time heals”, I don’t believe it does. I think it’s a bit like when you lose a limb. In the beginning, you have this enormous pain to deal with, as well as having to manage to do things while missing the limb. The event is catastrophic, everything takes a huge toll on you and is totally and utterly life changing, you will never be the same again. Over time the immediate searing pain passes. It still hurts terribly, if you think about it and that’s natural, but day to day the pain lifts. The loss of a limb will be always there and will always have a big effect on your life, but again in everyday life, you will struggle a little less everyday and find different ways of doing things. The gaping hole where your limb was, is still there and when you reflect you will probably still be sad and still hurt, but your psyche, will become stronger and I firmly think you will find peace. 

Sorry for rambling and taking probably too many words."
