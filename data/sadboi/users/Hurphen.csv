I am a chronic pain patient with Fibromyalgia and many other complications that have been going on for  much longer than the fibro has (5 years of fibro). 
I am happy to talk about all sorts of topics including what the condition does to me
How it affects my life/has changed over my lifetime
How relationships including platonic as well as sexual.
Sex with fibro
What outside forces do to me.
Work and chronic illness.

Also they are using the term ""spoon"" which is the first time I've ever heard able bodied people refer to spoons. Have they always known about the spoon theory and just ignored us when we talk about it? Or have they Just been googling around about their symptoms?

Maybe listen to Ester Perell's pod cast for ideas about how to have a good conversation.

I know they still did offer that back in 2018 when my friend looked into it as she graduated school. VIP makes rapid changes however. Sill a great company though! Much bigger than it used to be so much fewer incentives for teachers are required than they needed for recruitment. For instance they just restructured the recruitment program so that it's more difficult for individual teachers to recruit other teachers. Not that you shouldn't do it, you'll still make extra money!

However it's truly diet that makes the difference. Not just counting calories but WHAT you eat and WHEN you eat it. Look into keto and intermittent fasting. I'm not saying go all in and do these things hard core but understand the science behind why these things work will help you make the right choices for your body. Eating only within an 8 hour period of time during the day can make real sense. Not eating within a couple hours of sleeping is a life changer! 

Not only this but changing what you put into your body changes your pain triggers. Experimenting with removing sugars, gluten, and processed foods for example can be a life changer in reduction of inflammation this in turn helps with exercise and improved quality of life over all! Heck, some people have migraine triggers from crazy things like chicken eggs, they can eat chicken, duck eggs, quail eggs,  but not chicken eggs! 

It's great that you're thinking of making changes! Do some research, try things out, see what works for you. 

Best of luck!"

cfs,fhcjvkx,t3_f29hp1,1581464375.0,"This is so amazing! I live in rural Texas and there is a similar type spa I dream to visit a couple hours from me. One thing to remember is that if a massage from a massage therapist does happen it is likely your partner will be sore the day/evening following. Tons of water is essential! Especially with a pretty sedentary lifestyle to keep the soreness down. 

Whether or not you go all out with this special spa experience, a usual massage/nail type spa gift certificate, or the sweet apartment set up with rubs and cuddles you are amazing and wonderful to consider this!  Truly, kudos in all areas. And realizing you're not the ""care giver"" and shifting the dynamic of the relationship is HUGE. You should be very proud of yourself."
Fibromyalgia,fh67fod,t3_f0c2hg,1581295837.0,Yes! My professor once got shingles and was able to sympathize with me more after.
Fibromyalgia,fh66wad,t3_f0l4bm,1581295734.0,"Absolutely! Be careful because there are so many options but in general getting rid of processed chemical crap is always the best way to start! Processed foods and added chemicals are a huge trigger, for many so are white flour and processed white sugar. Those simple changes can make a world of difference."
Fibromyalgia,fh661lj,t1_fgv3lrf,1581295545.0,"Yes I came to recommend this! Mine is far different, it straps to the seat head to lean against and supports the neck. Its It's amazing! They vary widely so be ready to try many and ship back what you don't like. Also find some lumbar support."
Fibromyalgia,fh65c2u,t3_f12n0j,1581295276.0,I have a knot under my scapula that causes a plethora of issues which NEVER goes away no matter the treatments I call the satan knot.
Fibromyalgia,fh5aqw3,t3_f1esma,1581286874.0,"Don't be embarrassed! This is part of life, part of illness. However, at your age would you consider getting tested for other illnesses? I know it's scary but we have a tendency to chalk a lot of things up to our chronic illness without considering that it may be something else. Please care for yourself,  see your doc about this and be assertive! Don't let them write it off as another symptom just because they can. 
Good luck dear!"
