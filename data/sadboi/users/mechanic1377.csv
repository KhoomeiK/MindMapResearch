Listen, I know you may feel confused and afraid of what would happen next but you have to remember that you are not alone and there is still alot to do. I think the best thing you can do now is to tell your parents because they are the only people you can always trust. And if you think that telling them would ruin some relationships, you're wrong. You wouldn't know what will happen next, is going to be another harassment or the feeling of constant anxiety. And always rmember ruining a relationship is far better than the destroction of your own life."

But there is a point that made me to change my perspective and that is Odin posseses all the wisdom and we know that he never wanted to harm anybody for his own amusement but at some points he did things that could have been done someway else and that is just the I think.
