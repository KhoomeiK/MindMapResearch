It's been difficult trying to fill my days. But it's a catch 22 situation, because my I'm in a deep depression. I have no energy and my negative thoughts are running wild. My anxiety is passed my prescriptions strength. It's a really scary place."

depression,f5x0sca,t3_dpl4bu,1572533637.0,"I hear what you are saying. I'm considered SMI (seriously mentally ill). I suffer from deep depression, extreme anxiety, PTSD and chronic insomnia due to the trauma. I am a 38 year old student at a large University, where I take 15 credits a semester to graduate early. I hand in my homework on time, I have all A's in my classes and I haven't missed a single class. People look at me and think I'm just typical. What they don't know is I'm on the verge of crying most days, I'm extremely tired ALL THE TIME. But I pretend to be fine. Even with my friends. No one knows what I suffer from and how I feel."

If you look at me you wouldn't think I was suffering so much. I'm a student at a large University working on my second career. I make it to class every day, even though it's been 3 days since I slept a full night. I struggle to make it through each class but I do. I'm getting all A's.
