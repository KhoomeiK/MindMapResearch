It set off my social anxiety when his/our messes spread into common areas that we shared with roommates, so I stayed on top of that while he just didn't really register it, and meanwhile our own room became a disaster (which also made me really anxious, but not enough to fix everything once it got bad). Now with my place, I tried to keep up for the first few months there, but when the more severe depression hit (I mean, I'm always a depressed fuck, but May-August were particularly awful), it just got so bad that I haven't really been able to address it even when I've been feeling better. But now that I'm making even just a little progress, it feels more doable."

I'm on PS4 for RDR2. I'll start playing online after I finally get around to finishing the story...

And I love it that it's your ADHD SO who's reminding you to keep a tidy house, haha. Maybe that's just my own stereotypes that are making it funny for me. This friend I'm in love with encouraged me to clean just a little bit the other night. That's already made me feel a little better, even just having my desk chair cleaned off and free to sit in for the first time in months. So I just need to build off of that..."
actuallesbians,f2q98f1,t1_f2q7ob3,1570357895.0,"I gave him some treats earlier, and then he got pissed and hissed at me for no reason anyways! I can't win with this fucking cat. But I like him anyways. He has issues, like me, but he also loves my friend more than anybody else in the world, also like me. So, y'know, I can't dislike him. He just wants her to come home. (Oh my fuuuucking god, I'm such a corny, lovesick moron right now.)

And yeah, I've known she has a serious, long-term boyfriend whom she lives with and loves very much since before I even had a little baby crush on her (shortly after I broke up with my ex, conveniently). And yet my feelings did what they wanted to anyways, of course. But that's my problem, not theirs. She and her boyfriend have a healthy, loving relationship, and she and I have a healthy, mutually supportive friendship, and I just really don't want to compromise any of that. Doesn't stop me from all this goddamn daydreaming, though...

Most of my reading is for class right now, but I'm also reading Good Omens! I want to get through it before I watch the series. I was playing Red Dead Redemption 2 for a bit early in the spring semester, and then really severe depression overcame any desire to even play video games for a lot of the spring and most of summer, so I really need to jump back into that. And on the same note, yeah, my room is 100% depression nest right now. I know I need to clean and make it better, but just getting out for a few days is refreshing, and hopefully I'll have the energy and motivation to get my own room and bathroom (the rest of the apartment is fine, but I also avoid the rest of the apartment and spend most of my time in my room because... private bathroom and roommates I don't know very well and social anxiety) into shape a little more come Monday."
actuallesbians,f2q6nb0,t1_f2q5e0d,1570356600.0,"Man, there's a cat, but her cat is so much worse than my ex's cats! My ex was shitty, but he had the best fucking cats I've ever met! Meanwhile, she's the best person I've ever met and her cat's fucking bullying me! Lol.

I'm actually staying at her place this weekend specifically in order to take my mind off of *other* shitty things that are going on... Basically, she asked me if I could feed her cat while they were away because they live ~15 minutes walking from my place, and I asked if I could just stay at their place for the weekend instead because I needed a change of surroundings for a bit, so that's what's happening. And it's great! I love their apartment. It's just unfortunate that it also reminds me of how much I love *her*... and also how perfect her boyfriend is for her, and how they have this whole life together here that I have no desire to interrupt.

But yes, video games and reading are both great distractions! I'll do some more reading tomorrow, and video games when I get home if I've gotten enough of my work done. Meanwhile, being here is a great distraction in itself from being in *my* apartment, which is just a fucking disaster at the moment."
actuallesbians,f2q4ul6,t1_f2q12jg,1570355728.0,">he was a gaslighter too? Used to make you feel shit about yourself/crazy because of how your brain works etc?

Oh, yeah, absolutely. Definitely good riddance. But I miss his cats, and not being alone so often. And right now I'm sitting in the apartment that's shared by the straight woman I'm now in love with and her boyfriend, looking after their cat while they're away for the weekend, so that's a whole different sort of pain."

Don't worry about getting a little frustrated sometimes. I get frustrated with myself, too. But the acceptance afterwards is what really counts. Thanks for the encouragement. =)"

And then he'd get annoyed because I was ""ignoring"" him, when he never actually managed to get my attention in the first place because it doesn't just switch on a dime like that.

Like, you'd think it'd be easy to say ""I definitely experience sexual attraction"" or ""I definitely don't experience any sexual attraction,"" but then romantic attraction and aesthetic attraction and libido all get involved and all of those are typically conflated in most of the people we see, so it takes a lot of introspection to really figure out exactly what's going on."

actuallesbians,f1cow90,t1_f1co8i0,1569362256.0,"But I've known that since I met her, before we were even friends. She's straight, she's taken, she's too old for me, she's way too good for me. If knowing all the reasons she wouldn't be compatible with me was somehow a way to actually eliminate the feelings, there wouldn't be a problem. But I don't love her because of the potential for a relationship or compatibility with me as a person, I just love her for who she is, and she's gonna keep being that person and I'm gonna keep liking it. Yeah, being friends with her probably is needlessly torturing myself compared to the other option of just cutting her off entirely, but she's done too much for me and I value our friendship too much to do that."
actuallesbians,f1ciygu,t1_f1ce3es,1569358554.0,"Okay, but that could apply to literally anybody. I certainly can say that there's a higher likelihood she'd be good for me than a stranger because I know our friendship, but beyond that, of course you can't possibly predict what somebody would be like as a partner like that. Even people you've been with for years can turn out to be terrible; that's not really a reason to write off feelings from the start. But she's also literally never going to *be* my girlfriend, so ""would this person be a good girlfriend?"" isn't really the basis for my feelings in the first place and therefore isn't really a solid way to logic my way out of them. Like, what do I care if she'd be a terrible girlfriend or not when that has literally nothing to do with my feelings for her?"
actuallesbians,f1caf48,t1_f1ba2eo,1569353447.0,"I'm kind of learning that now. But then how does one just ""move on"" at this point? Getting over a crush is pretty easy; been there before.

But I guess if it was so easy to just choose to ""move on,"" it wouldn't be so much of a problem in the first place. Sure, yeah, ""move on"" is great advice if you have a little crush on somebody unattainable, but I'm kind of beyond that at this point and also not a robot whose feelings are turned on and off with a switch."
