So, look at your list of options, sort by those those have specialties in whatever your concerns are and go from there. Go to their websites and read how they introduce themselves. Is it to flowery? Is it too woowoo? Do they make jokes that you think fall flat? You can get a decent read of a therapist from their websites. The ones that resonate with you most- call/contact to see if you can set up a consultation (should be free) and that way you get a vibe for their voice and tone.

In terms of confidentiality- I’ve had sessions in (parked) cars, on walks, sitting at a park bench. The great part about online therapy is that it’s portable.

Antipsychiatry,fmw2vf3,t3_fxprex,1586438254.0,"My advice for whatever it’s worth-
No one will be able to tell you the exact path for you which means it’s up to you to experiment and find what works. 
I don’t know you’re background or what demons you’ve been dealing with, but what worked for me was:
Coming to a decision that I would not kill myself. I came to that realization after reading up on reincarnation seeing something that said (paraphrasing) “if you hit a tough spot in life and are considering suicide, that means you hit a similarly tough spot in a previous life and went through with it”. For whatever reason that really resonated with me and I decided that if I’m just going to keep rinsing and repeating the cruddy parts of life, then this time I’m going to get through it. So I decided that my focus was going to be on growth and aiming to be a little bit better every day/week/year. 
I then read all the self-helpy stuff I could get my hands on. Some were overly woo woo. Some were highly technical and didn’t make sense. Some flat out seemed to go against everything I believed. But some hit the middle of the road and struck the right chord with what I needed to be hearing at that moment. What’s awesome about right now is that there is so much information out there on just about everything. Some of it might be utter crap, but chances are there are little nuggets of goodness in everything you read. Start to collect those nuggets and test them out.
I think what I find to be challenging have gone through some darkness and come out on the other side is that it’s hard to remember what someone in that position would want or need to hear. I remember being depressed, I remember everything being bleak, but it’s taken on these fuzzy edges. I don’t even know if I’d be effective at talking to myself from back then. 
I don’t know if any of that was helpful. Take what was, leave the rest."
askatherapist,fmw0wqf,t3_fxpzuz,1586436869.0,"Sorry, I don’t get it either.

If my killed yelled at me that they were digging a graveyard I wouldn’t understand the context and would be annoyed that my kid was digging up my yard.
Was your mother supposed to learn something in the DBT group about graveyards?
Often, we have expectations for how we want our friends and families to respond to us while at the same time making it incredibly difficult for them to understand what it is that we’re asking for.
What was it that you wanted to communicate via digging a graveyard? What was it that you wanted your mom to do in response? Is it possible she didn’t understand how you were feeling or know how you wanted her to respond?"

For some sessions I actually feel more connected (usually when it’s audio only oddly) and others I feel like I’m only getting about 20% of the emotions coming through. It’s okay that the digital forms aren’t the most effective for you. Look at this period as a stop gap. The check-ins are probably better than nothing. And maybe there is some work that’s even more conducive to online work than in person. I’ve noticed that for some people, talking through a screen decreases the emotional intensity of the topic. There’s more emotional distance and because of that it’s a little easier to dissect and explore the beliefs that contribute to distress without then feeling overwhelmed by it. May or may not work for you, but something to experiment with. We’re all trying this stuff out and trying to find things that will work. Maybe you could even share this with your therapist and the two of you could brainstorm ideas to feel more connected?"
psychotherapy,fmvwkvk,t3_fxmu7x,1586433348.0,"I think you’re spot on in terms of what you’re considering. 
I would make it clear that you are an individual therapist and that by selecting you, they are acknowledging that that’s the service they want. (“So that means that because your child is an adult, you will not be getting updates on treatment, nor will I be discussing the case at all unless there was some emergency and/or your child specifically wanted you involved in a one-off session. My focus will be on your child’s goal and the material that her or she wants to be working on. This may dovetail with concerns the you have and improve your relationship, but there’s also a chance it may exacerbate the tensions in the relationship. If this is not suitable to you, and you would like to be more involved, then I suggest seeking out a family therapist who would work with all of you”)

TalkTherapy,fmaqlhz,t1_fmabx30,1585903898.0,"Trauma therapy through a computer isn't necessarily a bad idea in and of itself, but there are limitations to doing therapy via audio/visual only and sometimes those limitations aren't worth it.

For example, for some people, when processing trauma, they may become emotionally unstable. If someone dissociates during a video sessions, what would my options be as someone through the screen? I could attempt speak loudly or yell, maybe wave my hands. But what if they were doing the session through their phone and dropped it - now my ability to connect is completely gone while they're in a vulnerable and potentially risky state. I'd have to call an emergency contact to intervene whereas in an in-person session, I could go through various grounding procedures to try and bring the person back. 

Or, what if they start to dig into dark trauma places and the connection cuts out. Not just inconvenient, but potentially re-traumatizing if the therapist isn't able to quickly get into touch and process through what's happening for the client. 

Similarly, some trauma interventions are very body focused and could prove challenging via a video call. Not impossible, mind you. 

These are all considerations (and more) therapists make when deciding whether to offer telehealth services. Some therapists may be more risk averse than others. So may offer it with specific clients and not with other clients. There's a constant weighing of whether the benefit to doing some therapy outweighs the potential risks of either doing no therapy or doing telehealth that goes badly."

To a certain degree, we all avoid things we think may be uncomfortable. We make assumptions about the world based on the beliefs we’ve created based on our experiences throughout his life. Granted, sometimes those assumptions or beliefs aren’t fully accurate, but they feel true for us. Your friend is in a situation gay maybe even thinking about his options brings up uncomfortable emotions. Rather than feel them, it’s easier to put procrastinate and not think about. Is this the most effective/functional option? Nope, but he gets to make the choice with how he deals with it all.

It’s also not unusual for him to be able to have one skill mastered in one context (work) and not have it mastered in another. Again, beliefs, assumptions, perceptions come in and maybe he has previously developed a set of beliefs about how he behaves at work (I’m confident, I’m competent, I can make tough decisions, etc) that’s different from how he behaves normally.

If you would like to help your friend, presuming he even wants to go there or go there with you, you could try to talk to him about the situation, see what it is about it that he’s avoiding.

3) Mentally prepare yourself. Before bed every night imagine- in great detail - what those tryouts are going to look and feel like. Imagine sprinting so fast and seeing the coaches faces, noting that you’re impressing them. Imagine reading the list of the new team and seeing your name on their.

I tend to look for books that dig into the process of therapy too so you understand more about what’s happening in the room.

I’d also recommend three podcasts: very bad therapy (therapy trainees understanding how things went wrong in the room), the modern therapists survival guide and Esther perel’s podcast about couples/relationships. 

I love this field and am endlessly fascinated by it. It’s one of my favorite things about it. There’s hasn’t been a point yet where I feel “ok, I’ve got it, I’ve learned it all”. There are always new perspectives because humans keep coming out with new ways of being complex and fascinating. Welcome to the field!"
therapy,fkzrn2o,t3_fld6yy,1584678370.0,"I too went through a similar process.
What helped me better understand them and to be more compassionate towards them is learning more about their upbringing. My mother was the third child of an alcoholic who was probably also emotionally abusive. She and her siblings each learned to deal with that in different ways. My mom learned to avoid conflict by trying to make everyone laugh and if things got to heated, to escape to another room. While growing up if I tried to bring up hard stuff or dark stuff, it was met with jokes and laughter which was not what I needed.
My dad on the other hand was the only son of 5 to parents who were married too young/early, and immediately how to survive ww2 as a young couple. They got through it by not talking about anything and just hunkering down emotionally, completely in denial. All of my aunts have some sort of emotional scarring from their upbringing so while my dad seems normal, there are habits of his that drive me bonkers. 
It’s easy to look at someone and notice their flaws. It’s less easy to look at where they come from and not just understand how they became the way they are but really be compassionate towards them. Even someone like Trump you can look at and consider what circumstances he would have had to experience in order to become who he is. I can’t imagine it being all sunshine and roses.
The bottom line - we’re all doing the best we can given what we’ve learned about life. I’ve found a stronger relationship with my parents after bringing up the things that bother me in a curious, non-blaming way. It’s heartbreaking to hear some of their stories and realize they’re just people too and they’ve been hurt and scarred along the way."
askatherapist,fkurbkx,t1_fktpwzw,1584554691.0,"I concur with this. Adjustment disorder is often the diagnosis thrown at insurance companies who demand a diagnosis, but that’s provided you have a therapist who is willing to ignore other more prominent dx. There’s also the risk that depending on your insurance, they may be way more involved in your care than you’d like and may dictate certain types of treatment based on the diagnosis or even how many sessions you get. Reason 1 why many clinicians prefer not to be associated with insurance panels.

Also concur on the reduced rate piece. Many private pay clinicians offer a sliding scale - couldn’t hurt to check around. Psychology today is a good place to start.

therapy,fknu8pt,t3_fjkbwf,1584374030.0,"If you were suicidal to the point of needing an ER check two weeks ago, I would not recommend ditching therapy altogether. Sometimes sessions may feel like you’re not getting better from them, but they’re acting as a stabilizing function and making sure you don’t feel worse. Still, a conversation should be had.

Tell your T, “so, I’m not finding much day to day or week to week difference in my mood anymore, and I was experiencing that in the past”. It may help to use numbers. When I started, my mood was at like a 3/10. After several months, I got to a good place, maybe a 6/10 but then it dropped dramatically and I haven’t recovered.” You could ask for different suggestions in interventions or styles or maybe your T has noticed the dynamic in the relationship too and has some ideas on what’s happened. The biggest variable in therapy connected with effectiveness is the relationship you have with your T. Seems like something has changed there with you and your T and maybe that’s why you no longer feeling like you’re making movement."
therapy,fkngb90,t3_fje2fe,1584365029.0,"You're not shallow. Your anxiety is spiking (as is the whole world's) and the way your brain knows how to best calm you down is via ED behaviors. So know this - the rumination is there because of the anxiety. It helps to distract you from everything else that's going on.

You can try to 

1) Distract yourself using whatever means you have at hand: exercise, reading, knitting, crossword, learning some new hobby, talking to people, writing, drawing, cleaning/organizing, etc.

2) Face the anxiety (and whatever other emotions come up) head on: Start journaling. Practice mindfulness. Become aware and curious about what's happening in your mind/body. Learn more about your emotions and how they feel internally. What triggers the different emotions? What is your automatic instinct when you experience each emotion? Let your head freak out and see where the freak out thoughts are coming from. Try different breathing exercises to see how they impact the anxiety. As potentially triggering as this experience may be for you, you're also being given an opportunity to dig in a little deeper and learn more about how your ED functions. Maybe it's even time to share what's been happening and let your parents in on it and see if it's possible they can be supports. 

3) There are ED therapist (like myself) who either practice online or via phone. And especially now, even those therapists who typically don't telehealth are scrambling to figure out how to offer such services. Maybe you could reach out to your old therapist and see if he/she would be willing to do some sort digital/telephonic check-in to help you manage the increase in urges or know of a possible referral.

I also want to throw it out there that if there are people in OPs position and freaking out and don't have anyone to talk to, you are welcome to send me a DM. I'm a US-based therapist currently in Uganda where we have no cases (yet). If I can help by offering a chat or video consult while we're still relatively unaffected, I'll do so."

Much of that depends on the source of your stress and what you're currently doing to manage it. 

Probably a good time to take a wellness inventory and see what's lacking and/or over-emphasized in your life. I personally like using the wellness wheel/wheel of life to take stock. I rate myself in different categories and see where I'm falling short. Sometimes, it's really obvious what's missing, other times maybe not so obvious. Your therapist can help come up with strategies to help find balance in your life. Maybe that means carving out more time for personal health, or relationships or something else. He/she can also help you adjust mindset so that work feels less cruddy.

therapy,fkdpe33,t3_fht2s6,1584088804.0,"That's awesome that you're already starting to work on challenging your fears and it's definitely a stage in addressing social anxiety.

The other step is to notice and assess your train of thought. You've already got the notice part down because you're aware you're having the self-critical thoughts. The part where it seems you may stuck is that you accept the thoughts as fact and then react accordingly.

Most of us grow up without much consideration of what goes on in our heads and assume that the thoughts we have are ""us"". It's like the voice we have rolling around so if we think it, then it must be true. BUT, thoughts are just little synaptic firings in our head. Some are random and fire off only because we've thought them before so they're wired to be thought more frequently.

What you can start to do, when you notice the self-critical thoughts pop into your head is to assess them more analytically and start asking yourself how your thoughts know certain things to be true. You have a thought that someone thinks your ugly - ok, well, has this person ever told you that you're ugly? Told someone else that you're ugly? Made some sort of grimace while talking to you that would suggest she's having trouble looking at your face? Do you need to be 'not ugly' in order to talk to someone? Has this person given you any indication that he/she wants to be talking to your or enjoys talking to you? Does his/her facial expression seem friendly back or does it look annoyed/disgusted?

Next, do some deeper self-reflective work. What would it mean to you if you were weird/ugly/dumb/accented? Are such people unloveable? Unable to achieve success? Abject failures? Do you feel that's true of yourself?

Generally, the self-critical thoughts that pop into your head are there because you have a belief system in place that filters how you see the world. If you see the world as critical of you or you see yourself as someone who will never measure up, explore where those messages came from. Maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether the source of the beliefs are trustworthy.

Good luck!"

I think anyone who has fears that get in the way of living should confront those fears/anxiety. I live in Africa and am friends with a woman who is very afraid of any kind of slithery animal, even if it's a harmless gecko. She refuses to travel, to stay anywhere where there's a possibility of a little creature walking up the wall. To her, that makes her feel safe and more comfortable. To me, it seems like she is imposing limitations on her life unnecessarily. 

But it's also her life and if she's content to live her life that way, that's her prerogative. Similarly, you're an adult and you get to make the decisions regarding the kind of life you want to live. If you are content and satisfied with your choices, and those choices don't have an adverse effect on your health, relationships, life in general,  keep doing what you're doing.

askatherapist,fk72oou,t3_fgujm1,1583925832.0,"Mandated reporting does not mean that you get arrested or immediately identified as a pedophile.

What would get reported - if you've abused kids, if you're a danger to other, if you're a danger to yourself.

Since you're concerned about pedophilia, I'm going to assume it's related to some sort of sexual abuse or sexual contact with minors (even if you are a minor). First, you'd have to have actually DONE something or seem to indicate an intention to DO something. But let's say the therapist feels like whatever information you share warrants a call - they call CPS (you can even listen in on the call). They can pose it as a hypothetical to see if what you've shared is reportable (sometimes it's not.) If it is reportable, the CPS person gets as much information as possible and then they will determine if the information is worth investigating. If it is, they will question whoever the potential abuse victim is or his/her parents. They'll probably question your parents, etc. If there's nothing illegal going on, which you've said you haven't done, you're not going to get in legal trouble and instead my be recommended for some sort of counseling - which it seems is what you want. It may lead to some awkward/uncomfortable conversations with your parents, but could also lead you to getting the help you need.

On the other side of things - if what you're most concerned about are the THOUGHTS you've been having, then this is very much the realm of a therapist. Having upsetting thoughts is a very common reason for someone to go to therapy and does NOT invoke mandated reporting rules. If you're finding that you're sexually attracted to kids much younger than yourself, but have never attempted anything sexual, there is nothing there for a therapist to report. Instead, with your therapist you could work on your reaction to the thoughts and how to learn how to manage that reaction."
EatingDisorders,fk71fys,t3_fgt9ap,1583924681.0,"As much as you're able, start tracking and logging your binges. When are they happening? What's going on right before the happen?

Dig into what's going on for you. What thoughts are you having before, during and after? Were their other urges besides just the one to binge?

Start learning as much as you can about this current lapse. What's change for you recently? Often EDs serve as a way to manage something that feels out of control or upsetting in real life.

What skills worked for you when you were able to stop your symptoms before? What isn't working about those same skills now?

Get some support! Awesome that you were able to reach out here, but does anyone else in your life know what's going on? I know there can be a lot of shame in admitting that it's happening, but finding someone you can trust so they can share some of this burden can be really helpful.

So you have a few options.
If you’re not interested in going back to individual therapy, perhaps consider a support group or group therapy. This gives you the benefit of still doing it mostly on your own but you’d also have a venue to talk through the harder mental health stuff while still in a supportive environment. 

Sometimes you can find chapters of eating disorders anonymous (not to be confused with overeaters anonymous!) nearby.

If you still have friends who aren’t local but that you had closer ties with, try to set up a semi-regular schedule of chatting with them. 

Re: the friend you lost. Maybe making amends with him/her and issuing an apology explaining what you were going through at the the time.

None of what I’ve suggested thus far really gets to your original question. I think relationships take time to develop and you can’t always jump stages in the building of trust/intimacy.

askatherapist,fjnzyv2,t3_fedv69,1583517731.0,"I get this on multiple levels. When I was younger, I had a similar complex. I didn’t feel pretty, I didn’t feel sporty, so the only thing that I felt I was good at was academics. That thing then became my identity. It doesn’t matter if everything else in your life is crappy so long as you have good grades you can convince yourself that you’re okay.
The problem with this is that it creates a very fragile sense of self that is completely reliant on what quality about you that’s variable. Over the years you developed a belief about what success means for you. Whether that belief is right or wrong doesn’t matter because it becomes ingrained into you. So later, when circumstances change, and no matter what the X in X=success, chances are, circumstances will change that will require you to reevaluate your belief.
So here you are, now in college, questioning yourself because who are you if the one thing your identity hinged on doesn’t seem stable anymore? When you have the belief that the only way to be a success is through academic performance, you’re limited in your options for evidence of success. 

Step 1 of getting your mental health back on track - redefine what success means to you. Lower that bar waaaay down is that it’s easy to achieve. Success= talking to a stranger. Success=getting some exercise. success= farming your resume to 10 companies. 

Step 2 of getting your mental health back on track - realize that your thoughts are not factual. They are random little sparks in your brain. Some thoughts get thought more frequently because you’ve already thought them before. The more you think a thought, the more likely it will get activated and be thought again. You want happier more productive thoughts in your head? Start consciously putting them there. It will feel weird at first because they’re new. It’s like writing with your non-dominant hand. With practice, it become more automatic. Start questioning the validity of the thoughts you do have. Since you like journaling, one technique is to write a page in your normal hand/ piece and then write the next page with your non-dominant hand and react to what you just wrote. 

Step 3 of getting your mental health back on track - explore the different part of you. You have a critical element who seems to be running the show right now. That’s cool and all, but there are other parts of you. I imagine there is some part of you who doesn’t really care about the academic slip ups and maybe didn’t even want that plan anyway. Check in with that part. Or the young part of you who started this all off in the first place. What was that kid’s goal?

Step 4 - check in with your university counseling center. Most are free or low fee so take advantage while you can.

Step 5 - take one day at a time. This sucks now, but frankly it’s a needed obstacle for you to confront in order to become closer to your true self."

Some of these things are anecdotal and require you to try them out several times to see if they'd work for you.

1) Breath work/meditation- I have trouble establishing a consistent meditation practice, but while I don't sit in silence daily, I do regularly do some deep breathing exercises. There are many different styles of breath work, but the one that works for me, when I'm feeling stressed out and on the edge of snapping, is to take about a minute to focus on my breath and focus on slowing it down. Start by making each inhale about 4 seconds, holding for 4, then out for 4, holding for 4 (called 4 square breathing). Then I attempt to elongate the breath further to really just slllllooooowww down. While doing this I:

2) Do a body scan to check for tension. I often carry tension in my shoulders/upper back so I make it a point to release any tension I notice. A good time to check to see if your clenching your jaw, hands, brow, etc and then release them.

3) Mindfulness - which I see as different from meditation. Mindfulness is the act of noticing everything that's going on in your present. From the content of your thoughts, to how your body is feeling, to what you observe in your environment. This helps me get out of my head a bit. I especially like doing this outside if I'm walking somewhere I'll try to look for something in every color. Orange road work sign. Purple flower. Red coca cola can. Blue sign. etc. It gets me out of my head a bit.

4) Exercise - if you're chronically stressed you're muscles will be in a state of tension (ready to attack that lion). You can attempt to relax them via meditation, or something like progressive muscle relaxation, or you can use them and expel the tension that way. Particularly exercises that require you to really focus on what you're doing like lifting something heavy or sprinting. I find that doing the more steady state exercises still let my brain wander around a lot, although that can be useful in it's own right.

5) Get outside. It can help change your perspective. See different things. Smell different air. etc.

6) Be social. It doesn't have to be extensively so, but if you're at college, try to schedule or book something social every day. Class doesn't count. You need to build up relationships so that you can feel connected with your community. Depression thrives in loneliness. If you have social anxiety, work with your therapist to come up with some sort of exposure plan. 

7) Eat and sleep well. Not too much, not too little.

8) Gratitude/positive stuff. The depressed brain and anxious brain are really good at finding all the things that suck about life. Be intentional about noticing the stuff that's cool."

I used to weigh myself excessively too. Sometimes it was out of curiosity (""I haven't eaten anything in X hrs, has my weight changed yet? No? What if I go pee? NOW has it gone down?""), but more often it was a way to control how I felt. If the scale reported something positive, then I'd be calmed and I could continue on my day. If it was not what I wanted, then I had to focus and obsess on ways to make it change.

Imagine that the weighing is a dysfunctional way of managing your emotions. You logically know your weight hasn't done anything. But emotionally, there's something happening that feels so intense you're compelled to do something about it (almost like an addiction). Explore that. 

What are you worried will happen if you don't weigh yourself? Also, the treatment/fix for compulsive behaviors like that is to take away the opportunity to do the behavior. Ie, get rid of the scale. And then get a therapist."

Even if you explain in detail what happens when you try to approach someone, it can be more effective to have someone with you, coaching you through the therapy skills.

You’ve asked this question in a number of forums and still haven’t had much luck. Maybe there’s something going on a bit deeper that’s preventing you from achieving this goal- some core belief of yours that you adopted at a young age that then sabotages you now.
Definitely look into a therapist, with CBT experience, specializing in anxiety/social anxiety.
The part where you said you’re not comfortable talking to someone face to face suggests maybe there’s more global social anxiety going on than just this one very specific situation."
Stress,fipmiw5,t3_f8j9uv,1582611865.0,"There’s actually a whole model of therapy around stories and storytelling.
We often make stories about our life and what different events mean to us. Sometimes these stories are neutral, just the facts about what’s going on, but more often than not the narrator of our stories take on a biased slant.
You can look back on your life and say that you’re weak and you can’t take a hit and that you can’t bounce back up, and your brain will run with that information and show you how it’s true.
If you want something different than that, you have to switch narrators and tell a different story. This isn’t about fictionalizing your life, but about viewing what’s happened to you thus far and what can hope through a different lens.
What do you want your story to be? Is there a way to draw meaning from what you’re going through right now?
As a thought experiment, try imagining your story from different angles.

1) we already have eeyore’s version. Everything is bleak and horrible and getting worse every day.

2) how about a Pollyanna version? That all of this struggle turns you into a success magnet and you become a leader in helping others dig their way out of darkness

3) a comedy: there’s a higher power up there he just enjoys poking at you until you lighten up 

4) the fairytale: you struggle and struggle until a hero appears and rescues you from your demons

 5) other versions

The facts of your life might be out of your control, but how you choose to see your life is up to you.

askatherapist,fijc9gi,t3_f822z7,1582441747.0,"I mean, maybe? But that would depend on whether the therapist found out. 
I used to work for one of the online sites. It’s true that they filter out the more severe mental health concerns because the risk in working with those via Telehealth are higher. If you become actively suicidal in my session, I’m limited in my reaction if you’re just on a screen. 

I don’t think you’d be the first person to attempt to lie to one of the services. Where most people get hemmed up is the form of payment. You’d have to give credit card information with an accurate billing address in order to proceed passed the trial window. So if you manage to pass through that then you could pretend your’re an adult, but chances are you’d slip at some point. And when the therapist found out she’d have to terminate unless you were willing to get your parents involved. Or, worse, she’d report you to the company and they file legal action against you for providing false information.
That’s all excluding the possibility that if you did happen to become more suicidal, the therapist would have no means to intervene because the emergency contact would presumably be incorrect and your address would be incorrect so sending emergency services to you would fail.

Bottom line - not a great idea. Maybe your parents would be more accepting of the idea that you expect?"
Stress,fijb9s8,t1_fifufwm,1582440616.0,"Fully concur. In fact, I’m using one of those strategies right now (deep breathing) so I don’t snap at my kids right now. One of whom just deleted the long post reply I had written up but hadn’t sent and the other who is going to the bathroom but then doing things like dragging dirty TP across the floor.

All of the things mentioned can work, but as u/HapyAndrew mentioned, the goal is to calm down your nervous system so it’s not in fight/flight mode. 

In addition to calming the nervous system, finding ways to address the source of stress. Some thing we can’t control and that’s where the de-stress strategies come in but also looking at ways to prioritize/adjust the things you can control. Sometimes that’s coming up with a plan to tackle specific problems/projects. Sometimes that’s talking to a boss/partner to ensure your workload feels doable. Sometimes that’s making sure your own strategies are effective for getting things done."

askatherapist,fiaxerz,t3_f7dyhz,1582310298.0,"1) Try doing a search for online therapists (individual ones, not through one of the large platforms) in your state (provided you’re in the US). You may have more options for time schedules that way.

However

2) If things are going that poorly in your life and you’re that distressed, it’s time to readjust daily priorities. Take some sick time to get the appointment made at the place near you. Talk to your boss/bosses about needing to adjust your schedule for medical purposes. If you were physically injured and needed to see a physical therapist weekly, you’d need to do the same thing. It doesn’t seem like your mental health is going to be fixing itself any time soon so you’re going to need to make some changes. Good luck."

Doing things outside of your comfort zone is great. It's an important part of growing and adapting and improving as a person. However, there is a point where the stress related to the change is too much and it becomes overwhelming and you no longer get the same benefit.

Think of your social activities as a type of phobia (not saying you have a social phobia, just try this as a thought experiment). If you were afraid of snakes there are going to be situations that you're comfortable with (hanging out with mice, no snakes in sight) a little uncomfortable with but you can handle (seeing a stuff snake or a picture of one) and things that feel WAY uncomfortable and are overwhelming (seeing an actual snake). Forcing yourself to interact with a snake when you haven't yet learned how to manage less anxiety-provoking situations is just going to result in you freaking the f out and having to use other behaviors to cope. Instead, you want to practice doing the things that are slightly uncomfortable but you can manage them until they feel less uncomfortable. Only then do you amp up the challenge.

What you're talking about is a form of emotional exposure, not unlike doing exposure work for any other kind of phobia. So in your situation - on a 1 to 10, how stressful is attending club 1? How stressful is attending club 2? If you're at a 7 or higher, maybe rethink your plan. Try to find a social activity that only gets you to about a 5/10, OR figure out a way to make going to the clubs a 5/10 (bringing a friend, only going for an hour, etc.). 

Meanwhile - sounds like you need to do some internal work on the social anxiety front. Learning mindfulness/breathing skills to calm your body down + some thought analysis to make sure your thoughts are running amok.

Good luck! Let me know if any of that needs clarification."
askatherapist,fi9rujn,t3_f75ia8,1582279206.0,"1) Broaden yourself while you're in college. Don't feel like you need to take 100% psychology courses. Try some classes in religion, sociology, criminology, computer science, biology etc. You don't need a psychology major to become a therapist. I was very thankful that my school offered a cognitive science program that required me to take classes outside of my comfort zone and become aware of different perspective on life, consciousness, learning, etc and then paired that with a language program that had me learn about things from a non-western perspective. 

2) Volunteer with a population you think you might like to someday serve. It could be in a homeless shelter, a daycare, a hospital or psych clinic. Crisis lines are also good options. Maybe your school has some sort of peer mediation type programs. Really anything to start dipping your toes in to help you better refine your interests. If you're thinking you want to join a PhD/PsyD program, look into the psych labs at your school and see if you can't volunteer there. 

3) Interview other clinicians. This was a requirement for my (and many other) grad programs. My biggest mistake was not fully understanding the different paths to becoming a therapist nor what being a therapist could look like. I didn't really get the difference between a psychologist vs. social worker vs. counselor, etc. Interviewing clinicians will give you an idea of the lens through which they view clients/patients and their issues as well as what their normal day is like. How much of their day is spent with clients? What are other career options once you have the required degree? Do you like the work?

4) Absolutely get your own therapy. If you're in college now you likely have access to cheap/free counseling through your school's health center. Sometimes school's also have training clinics for their psych/sw/counseling programs. Binge on therapy. Get a sense of what it's like from the client end. Try different styles. See if there are groups available. If you have any of your own stuff, and we all do, start getting a handle on it now."
Stress,fi6s4kx,t3_f2i1t8,1582205973.0,"The original ""relaxation response"" by Dr. Herbert Benson (I think written in the 70s) said to give yourself about 10-20 minutes of breathing. This wasn't necessarily in response to acute stress, but as a daily practice to improve your ability to respond to stress.

I heard in a workshop on trauma (but can't confirm because apparently I didn't write it down), that the initial surge of adrenaline in a stress response lasts for less than a minute before cortisol takes over. If you can intervene immediately after the stress response, you can prevent the cortisol spike from happening. That's more timeline vs, duration though.

Personally, I can feel a difference in about 60 seconds, but I've also been practicing for awhile. Prior to going to the doctor's office or anywhere I'd need to get my BP taken, I'd do some breathing exercises for a minute or so (sometimes less, the length of time for the cuff to puff up), and I could have a fairly significant effect on lowering it. Granted a lowered BP doesn't necessarily indicate that you're out of the stress response, but at least subjectively I feel more relaxed.

If I have trouble sleeping at night, I can usually get my body into a relaxed, sleep-ready state in less than 5 minutes. 

I don't so much count breaths as just focus on the breathing itself, particularly the exhale, pausing at the top and bottom of each breath for a moment. 

You're right that most articles on breathing/stress response don't like listing times/duration which can be frustrating. But like most things, it's going to vary person to person anyway. Be your own laboratory and start experimenting with different times/number of breaths. It would be interesting to hear what works for you."
Stress,fi6o716,t3_f6o3o8,1582202712.0,"1) Breathe! If you're feeling stressed out, your body is in the fight/flight mode longer than intended. Step one is to try to get your nervous system out of that mode and get into a rest/digest mode. Breath work is one of the quickest ways to deescalate your nervous system. The exercise I like most is to focus on your out-breath, trying to make it a little longer each time and pausing at the beginning and end of each breath.

2) Relax. I don't mean this in a ""just chill out, man"" kind of way, but to systematically scan through your body for tension and consciously and intentionally relax the muscles that are tensed up. Most commonly, shoulders and jaws get really tense when stressed out. You can also start at the bottom, tense your feet for 5 seconds then relax. Then tense your calves for 5 seconds, relax them. Then tense your thighs for 5 seconds, relax. etc, all the way up your body.

3) Do some anti-anxiety therapy exercises. When you're most stressed out, check in with your thoughts to see what the general content is and review them for accuracy. Just because you have a though, doesn't make it true. Ie, ""The world is going to end if I'm 5 minutes late"". Really? Is it? I know you know that's not really the case. So then what is the most likely consequence if you're 5 minutes late? You get dinged on your grade? The professor shoots you nasty glare? Absolutely nothing happens? And if those less than positive things DO happen, so what? Can you survive a bad grade? Can you survive a mean face?

4) Ask for help. When you're feeling more calm, talk to your wife about responses that would be helpful from her when you're having a higher than average stress day. Does that mean to give you lots of space? To not bring up decisions that can be postponed? To give you a big hug and tell you that you're doing a great job?  That you need her to take on more?

5) Make sure you're covering your other physical health bases as much as possible. Sleep. Eating well. Some form of movement. Your body is trying to keep up with the mental demands as much as possible so make sure you're giving it the resources it needs to handle it as best as it can.

6) Ask for more help. Don't feel like you have to wait until you're at your breaking point to contact a therapist. Sometimes it can take a few weeks to get an appointment and you don't want to be going through that when you're already maxed out. Source: am therapist.

selfhelp,fi07tib,t3_f57z46,1582029518.0,"I get this a lot. Change can feel overwhelming when you look at the big picture. But it’s not all going to happen in one day, and working on all of your goals all of the time mean that you’re only spending small amounts of time on each goal. Prioritize prioritize prioritize.
1) write a list of all your goals down.
2) pick a handful to work on at any given time. Some people recommend picking an easy goal just to boost confidence, but sometimes tackling bigger ones give you more momentum. Pick your preference.
3) Break the bigger goals into bite size goals. This can sometimes be easier or harder to conceptualize depending on how concrete your goals are.
4) now identify a goal that’s going to help you work on the others. For example, one of my big goals for this year is to keep myself hydrated and get movement in every day. Neither are super challenging in theory but once my day gets started, there are so many other things going on that I easily get distracted and they don’t happen. So instead, I make it a practice to chug a bunch of water and do a quick 10 min mobility routine every morning. I wake up at least 30 minutes earlier than I need to be up so I have the time to focus on those two goals. Then it doesn’t matter what happens with the rest of my day.

I love the mentality that you’re just trying to be 1% better than yesterday. You don’t need major day to day changes to see dramatic long term effects. If you have a bad day/week, it’s not like the game is over. Dust yourself off, review where you went wrong, and try again."
