Last year I was going trough a similar thing, and I felt alone. Then, one of my classmates and I began talking, she said she was also going trough some things earlier this year, I underestimated her at first, and then she sent me pictures of her hand that was scarred really bad (she cut herself). Anyways, we began talking, and we helped each other out of a toxic mindset.

What I‚Äôm trying to say, are two things;
1) Talk to someone. It really helps, really, don‚Äôt underestimate it. The problem is that you can‚Äôt talk to your friends, and I don‚Äôt know what to suggest, but try to find a solution.
2)Look at the bigger picture, you can survive this, I don‚Äôt want someone to kill themself‚Äôs because literal homework. Please, stay strong.

I didn‚Äôt say for example ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to get better‚Äù, cause it didn‚Äôt help me when I was in that mindset,  instead, I showed you HOW it can get better. I‚Äôm willing to talk to you if you want :)"

I could be wrong tho, if you have other friends that play, or even have some friends in brawl stars with the same amount of trophies, you can compare your account to theirs. I remember that I got my last mythical 6 months after I started, but I don‚Äôt remember my trophies from then.

If you find out that you are unlucky, this usually means that you will have a period where you are very/really lucky later.

Good luck :)"

Yeah, I understand, but my comparison still stands, take it as a metaphor... 
I don‚Äôt necessarily think you‚Äôre evil, I think [dont get offended now], that you are uneducated. There is a reason why so many people think it‚Äôs a bad thing. I do not know if you are, but I assume you aren‚Äôt a flat earther. This is because of multiple reasons probably, but one of the big reasons is because so many people believe it‚Äôs round, right? After looking at facts (like gravity and the horizon) you have come to the conclusion that the earth isn‚Äôt flat. The same things apply about climate change.
