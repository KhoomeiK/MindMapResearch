PMDD,fh6hfm2,t3_f0djtv,1581298980.0,"Thank you so much for sharing this! ðŸ’œ You did such a great job explaining what it's like. How were you able to convince (or find an OBGYN that listens) your doctor about trying the Lupron? I'm 29, have one child and my OB is very reluctant to go there even though I've come in with so much evidence about how PMDD is affecting my life. I am soo glad you have found relief!! It's really inspiring to know it can get better :)"
PMDD,fh6gu05,t3_f18mxa,1581298778.0,I get panic attacks really bad too ðŸ˜ž it's the worst! I'm 29 and I totally hear you on being worried about getting a stable job and what life is going to be like. It's really hard..you're not alone and it's not you're fault ðŸ’œ I'm in the process of trying to address my hormones so hopefully there will be some relief soon.
