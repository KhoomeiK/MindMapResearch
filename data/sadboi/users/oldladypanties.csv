I have given up on my narcissistic mother. I tried for years to have a relationship with her. But after so many years of gaslighting, threats, tantrums, nasty comments, fixation on the past (everything that everyone has done to supposedly disrespect her), and never truly feeling loved unconditionally, I decided this New Years to call it quits. I no longer argue or debate with her. I agree, even if I know she‚Äôs wrong. I believe this is called gray rocking. I limit our talks to 2 times a month, and only stick to safe boring topics.

Re-parenting advice? Well, I‚Äôve been in therapy. So go to therapy. If you are not able to, find someone whom you can talk to about this, that won‚Äôt judge you. Some (former) friends said, ‚Äúbut she‚Äôs your mother‚Äù. Being my mother does not give her a pass on treating me or anyone else badly. 

I have to re-program my inner voice, so I‚Äôm not always second guessing myself. So trust your gut. Write a letter to your narcissistic mother. You don‚Äôt have to share it with her. Re-read the letter when you have any self-doubts. Write a letter to yourself, about your strengths and what makes you happy.

FundieSnark,fitr6k2,t3_f9t7p4,1582727534.0,"She‚Äôs always judging women. Such as debt free virgins without tattoos, working women, women who leave abusive husbands, women who wear yoga pants and tank tops. Just ridiculous.

I wonder who, in her family, judged her and maybe told her off."
FundieSnark,fir6pqp,t1_fio6dh3,1582658458.0,"Yes, they are in Port Charlotte, FL. Jill's comment about fishing in the Gulf made me wonder if they had left the Kellers for warmer weather, so I googled the church. I wonder where they're headed next."

FundieSnark,fi7f7hv,t3_f6u627,1582220230.0,Does anyone know if Bethy received proper pre-natal care? I think that a lot of birth defects can be found out relatively early on with sonograms and blood tests.
FundieSnark,fi6pekf,t3_f6o5lp,1582203767.0,"My daughter has a pet box turtle. We feed it special tortoise/turtle food, lettuce, carrots, strawberries, catnip, shrimp, but not pretzels. Ugh, can Jill be that stupid to throw pretzels? Were they even allowed to feed the wildlife?"
FundieSnark,fi6nn1c,t3_f6qsc9,1582202206.0,"She should not be homeschooling, since she doesn‚Äôt know the difference between ‚Äúaffect‚Äù and ‚Äúeffect‚Äù."

Henry has the queen size bed (with no sheets), while Spurge has the toddler bed? Not sure what the logic is there."
FundieSnark,fhvq2wn,t3_f4yg83,1581900032.0,"Hmm ü§î you know what would have been nice? If Jill and David had been the ones doing the waiting, and the kids got to sit and be waited on. That would have been something that Jill would have been praised over. But nope, it‚Äôs the same shit , different day. Jill and David are horrible parents."
depression,fhqhzvu,t3_f49c1i,1581804509.0,"Thank you for your time and life story. 

I have been a good actress for decades, hiding my depression and ptsd, and now I have no idea who or what I am anymore. With the help of my psychologist, I‚Äôm trying to peel the layers of my fake self. It‚Äôs just how can I find out who my authentic self is? Before I became broken, decades ago, I knew myself. Now I see, I don‚Äôt even know what my favorite color is. 

Some recent events have exposed my secret and made me see depression is nothing to hide."
depression,fhqgp0d,t3_f1yg2s,1581803940.0,"I called 911 recently for help, first time ever, as my husband was drunk and I was going through a really bad depressive episode. Honestly, he was doing his best but too drunk. The police arrived, saw bruises (from where husband tried to restrain me) , pushed me to say that he was abusive (keep in mind I‚Äôm depressed and can‚Äôt think clearly), and he got arrested while I ended up alone. The state attorney refused to drop the charges, so I hired an attorney to assist. So, yea it‚Äôs hard when I reach out for help and get nothing. I was afraid that I‚Äôd spiral further down. 
I called at least 60 psychologists, in a 3 day period. Two responded. One couldn‚Äôt meet me for three months. Another was a week later, but I had to drive an hour to his practice. He was and is great. He got me in touch with a psychiatrist for anti-depressants. 
But my husband is still facing charges and I‚Äôm stressed out about it all. I am alone still, afraid to start meds, because what if the meds have negative effects. 
Ugh, depression sucks."
