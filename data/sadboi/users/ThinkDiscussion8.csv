Do you journal? Maybe it’d help to write it out to pinpoint some issues? I’m actually gonna start journaling my moods just to track my ups and downs. 

And same, reach out if you need to!!! I think mine (there’s some childhood trauma in my background that I’m sure didn’t help, sexual abuse, etc.) but my mom has it, my aunt had it and I’m pretty sure their dad, my grandpa, had it plus I think my half sister, my dad’s daughter, also has it. I never thought it’d run on his side of the family but ya just never know."
bipolar,fqmacoe,t1_fqm9t7m,1589474171.0,"Yup, preach on! I have the same problems and everyone around me gets even more upset when I keep saying I’m sorry, but I just feel awful when I act out. I don’t mean to and in the moment I usually don’t initially realize anything is wrong until later. And yes I’m really grateful to have a community to discuss this with because it’s honestly something I’ve been denying for years, but the older I get the worse it gets and I need some help."
bipolar,fqm8t90,t1_fqm8q89,1589473442.0,At least we’re all in it together.
bipolar,fqm4plv,t3_gjd0ur,1589471464.0,"🙋🏻‍♀️yup. I actually had a self destructive episode about 2 weeks ago. I woke up feeling off, but by the next day I was back to “normal”; ya know not crying and driving everyone around me crazy with my mood swings. I HATE this fucking disease."
Paranormal,foma2dq,t1_fom07ji,1587882875.0,I saw something like that when I was a little girl. We lived in a haunted house growing up and one night I asked whatever it was to come out and show itself to me. Nothing happened so I left my bedroom and went into my mom’s room to watch tv with her. Next thing I know I feel something is watching me and I look behind me and see this huge shadow block the light in the next room. It scared me and I couldn’t move so I turned back around to distract myself with the show we were watching. That’s when I felt this thing tug on the back of my shirt. I flew off that floor and into bed with my mom. It was definitely a moment I’ll never forget.

Mediums,fn2pd2w,t3_fyvmkn,1586597884.0,I have the same issue quite often.
IDOWORKHERELADY,fmmnlsd,t1_fkoqvy7,1586208584.0,Lol I’ve been a PA before and I don’t get why she thought that attitude was gonna help her on that job.
trashy,fmmjvtk,t1_fmjsn9h,1586206605.0,"I used to work retail and I bet the girl the employee pushed is some fuckin shoplifter making her rounds. I get being angry enough to push a shoplifter, but it’s really not worth your job or getting into an altercation with a slimey individual."
